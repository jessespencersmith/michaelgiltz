It was a downhill day at Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It began with the dependably engaging Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki.But each successive movie was less and less engaging.Oh well, not every day can boast The Tree Of Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Onthe other hand, if the international press were voting,Aki's Le Havre would be a contender for the top prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LE HAVRE ** 1/2 out of **** In this typically eccentric and charming comedy by AkiKaurismaki, the people of a small port town cometogether to help an adorable illegal immigrant get fromFrance to England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That hardly captures the oddball goofiness of Aki (I'm having trouble spelling his last name, so I hope he'll forgive my informality).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero is a shoeshine salesman with a loving wife who takes care of him completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's always a dime short but full of good cheer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Aki's deadpan way, wesee our man interact with his friendly fellow neighbors, whether it's the woman with a bakery who letshim take bread on credit ("Your bill is as long as the Congo," she complains. "I'm your best customer, "he blithely responds) to the grocer who hurriedly tries to close shop when he sees our hero coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyall stand ready to help a teenage boy be reunited with his mother in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one seems terriblywound up by race or politics (it simply never comes up), not even the policeman assigned to track the kid MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 New Photos Emerge In Anthony Weiner Twitter Scandal Anthony Weiner Admits Sending Racy Pictures, Refuses To Resign FOLLOW US PHOTOS: Who Won Big At This Year's 'Fashion Oscars'?Nancy Pelosi Wears Vintage Thierry Mugler To 7 Sites You Should Be Wasting Time On Right Now7 Celebrity Fad DietsBIG NEWS: Celebrities LeAnn Rimes Movies Celebrity Body Microsoft More Log in | Sign Up News Web Bad Guy?

So, no spoiler alerts on this review because that's exactly what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Getting to that point is fun for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julio is a college student who had a romance with Emilia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he's dating another girl who believes he's working as a typist for a famed novelist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juliojumped the gun on that job, so to keep the fiction going, he has to actually write a novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That meanstelling his new girlfriend the story of his first love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a clever conceit and the movie is peppered withliterary touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, we are clearly supposed to believe that Emilia was Julio's great lost love.But the more we see of their relationship, the more believable it seems that their dating simply reachedits natural conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes it hard to feel poignant when the sad news reaches Julio that Elena isdead. (We, of course, knew it from the start.) The leads are able, especially Diego Noquera as the slightly hapless Julio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This screening was bedeviled with technical difficulties (including bad audio that brought the film to a halt at the half hour mark), but funnily enough the portions marred with those problemswere the best of the film, so I don't think it kept me from getting a good sense of what Jimenez was goingfor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HANEZU NO TSUKI * 1/2 out of **** This turgid drama from writer-director Naomi Kawase is a complete disappointment, one of those movies that puzzles you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why exactly was it accepted for Competition at Cannes? Some movies benefit not beingin the white hot spotlight that brings and would do better in a sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This movie would be receivedpoorly in any context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're told of a Japanese legend in which two mountains famously vied for the loveof a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is compared to our main story in which two men compete for the love of a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One man is married to her but a bit prosaic, going on and on about the local produce of their town and how they should market it better and maybe open a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other man is an artist, a sculptor whowanders about in the rain and takes his shoes off at an archeological dig because he's just that funky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shebounces back and forth between the men repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we're told in voice-overs about that legendabout the mountains again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To drive the point home, the woman's story is contrasted with hergrandmother, who apparently was in an arranged marriage but loved another man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we're told aboutthe legend again, just in case we've forgotten about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This movie is rather like Terrence Malick in its use TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 11 Ice Loves Coco Stars Keep it Real Laurence FishburneLeaving CSI Jennifer Connelly GivesWater Birth MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.comKids Kim K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopes to Be Pregnant 'by End of Year' Nicolas Cage's SonHospitalized After Fight Jennifer Love Hewitt: Worst Actress In Hollywood?
