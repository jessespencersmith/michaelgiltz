Will Topher Grace become the next Tom Hanks? And did you see the Grindhouse movies in the theater, will you check them out on DVD or do you just not care about zombies and hour-long car chases?

Do the big shots throw scripts at her? Or does her agent not have a clue as to what to give her? Because she does have an unusual personna and maybe, just maybe, dispite her acting chops, she just doesn't come across as someone that is the first pick as an actress in a big budget romance or drama movie?(Is actress the right word or is everyone an ACTOR now, I get confused) I find myself in a delimma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I liked Topher in T70S, but I thought he basically played a version of that character in all of his movies except Spiderman 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I just cannot see him ever taking over the mantleof Hanks or Lemmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not even in my wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just doesn't have that....well...that indefinablesomething that made both those men such great stars to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even in Good Company just seemedlike a more mature version of Eric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traffic and SM3 were about the only ones he seemed like adifferent person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grindhouse was great and I would love to see the long versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something about his movies that just makes you love them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has a great style of moviemaking and he'll always get my money for tickets. fetacheese See Profile I'm a Fan of fetacheese permalink uhhh...topher grace is one to follow? i mean, he made some pretty good films but he was also in "win adate with tad hamilton!"--so, maybe it's not just about picking the right roles any more than it's taking ajob to make some money.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Balzac See Profile I'm a Fan of Balzac permalink AIG Computers India Barack Obama Michelle Obama Sports Olympics Housing Crisis Fox News MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

In this industry, you have to stay true to your art, but you also want to protect your future, and have a cushion so that you can take theroles that pay less, but offer more, artistically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hillary hasn't made any choices shecan't recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Well, maybe she was cashing in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can do that without doing junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And onceyou start making movies for the money, it can become very hard to regain themomentum you had artistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And long term, you'll do a lot better financially if youmake good movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, there's Nicolas Cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All mamacat See Profile I'm a Fan of mamacat permalink I love Hilary Swank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is incapable of making a bad movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like Topher Grace, but really, to compare him to Ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swank? Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink You're teasing, right? You don't think The Core was a bad movie? DasBoot See Profile I'm a Fan of DasBoot permalink Yes, Hillary Swank made some bad choices in-between, but nothing comes close to Halle Berryfollowing her Oscar with the god-awful Catwoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She should have been forced to return the trophyright then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what happens when the Academy gives out an Oscar based on one good movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kate Winslet on the other hand delivers world class performances in great movies en mass, but still gets shunned. rpence See Profile I'm a Fan of rpence permalink Another good thing about Kate W. is that she gets naked a lot in movies--and that'ssomething never to be shunned!! Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Yes, I think all actors -- male and female - should be encouraged to embrace nudity Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:00 AM on 10/18/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:11 PM on 10/18/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:52 PM on 10/18/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:49 AM on 10/19/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:46 AM on 10/18/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:05 PM on 10/18/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:21 AM on 10/17/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:24 PM on 10/17/2007Michael Giltz: DVDs: Can Someone Save Hilary Swank From Herself? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-can-someone-save-hi_b_68667.html [4/5/2009 8:33:18 PM] -- even when they reach their AARP years like the commendable turns by Nicholson and Kathy Bates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Catwoman was horrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she also followed the Oscar with two more X-Men movies andJinx in Bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of them challenging, but very commercially successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus the TV movieTheir Eyes Were Watching God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So nothing to cement her abilities as an actress, but shestrengthened her box office pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kate Winslet indeed has excellent, challenging taste andproven she's the real deal many times over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apples See Profile I'm a Fan of Apples permalink My biggest problem with Tarantino's 'Death Proof' is Trantino himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He keeps getting in the way ofhis own junky material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no denying the power and the fun of the climactic car chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've played the final 20 minutes over and over several times, but despite the acclaim the director continues to receive for the rhythmand delivery of his dialog, this longer version released just a couple of weeks ago actually highlights thefilm's - and the director's - enormous weakness; every character talks exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are these the only kind of people Tarantino knows? He needs to expand his social activities and listen to conversations made by people who read something more substantial than a graphic novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everyone drops the f-bomb after every other syllable or knows the lyrics to songs by Dave Dee, Dozy,Beaky, Mick and Titch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, each character is foul-mouthed, seemingly uneducated, trivial, and full ofpop-culture references that serve no purpose other than highligting the fact that these people havenothing interesting to say, and in this longer version they keep saying nothing in particular for over 90minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only performer that can't deliver Tarantino's dialog is the director himself, and that'sbecause he's such a lousy actor of no depth whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I look forward to the day when Tarantino writes and directs an intelligent drama populated with people who actually sound as though they completed college, have never read a comic book, don't require junk-culture references to make a point, and no one carries a gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, that's a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure he's up to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For anyone who might be interested in the old-fashioned double feature of the early days of cinema, complete with fake trailers, try to find a copy of 'Movie Movie' with George C Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not a great film, buthumorous, all the same, and worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citizen54 See Profile I'm a Fan of Citizen54 permalink I agree that Tarantino's dialog can be a flaw and think you described the problem perfectly.But I do think he made an "intelligent drama" with Jackie Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, there was the prolific swearing, and the jokey stuff like the chicks-with-guns bit on tv (hilarious), but the conversations between Jackie and the bail bondsman (played by Robert Forster) were mature and believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I first saw the movie, I wondered if Tarantino wrote their lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valkyrie See Profile I'm a Fan of Valkyrie permalink I'm not sure you know what grindhouse cinema is or have ever seen one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I own hundreds oftitles from the era and I'm happy Tarantino and Rodriguez tried to make a new one for a newgeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's remember folks: With names like Death Proof and Planet Terror, I don't thinkthey were trying to make a college-grad film with no guns and oscar-caliber dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Youhave to love those old grindhouse movies to really be able to talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And somethingI've found, people love to talk about movies and genres they know nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's likeputting down Cannibal Holocaust for being Cannibal Holocaust. "I hate cannibals andcannibal movies! So I'm going to talk about how bad it is and how I wish it could've been just like Million Dollar Baby!" Maybe Cannibal Holocaust just isn't for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, if you want depth and meaning in your movies, just look at Hillary Swank's latest . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valkyrie See Profile I'm a Fan of Valkyrie permalink PS&gt; My above post was aimed at Apples, not Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:12 PM on 10/18/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:20 AM on 10/17/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:54 PM on 10/16/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:00 PM on 10/20/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:14 PM on 10/17/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:15 PM on 10/17/2007Michael Giltz: DVDs: Can Someone Save Hilary Swank From Herself? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-can-someone-save-hi_b_68667.html [4/5/2009 8:33:18 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE Comments are closed for this entryThere are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I'm not sure if you think Tarantino could do a better job at the sort of film he makes or just don't like his type of movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'll always make flicks stuffed with pop cultural references, I'mafraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't made up my mind yet whether I prefer his shorter or longer version, butunlike most critics I thought Rodriguez did a better job of creating a real grindhouse movie.Tarantino amde a "real" movie pretending to be grindhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apples See Profile I'm a Fan of Apples permalink Don't misunderstand me, I like his movies a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like the way they look - the widescreen photography, the framing, the use of color - plus I really do like his writing,but there comes a time when you want such a talent to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd like him to trulychallenge himself and stop making all of his characters sound the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Uma Thurmon's character finally comes face to face with John Carradine in 'Kill Bill' I was waiting for some verbal fireworks to explode, something truly inventive to knock my socks off - considering what we'd been through up until that point I think the audience deserved some startling pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Carradine's character startsusing comic book references, just like so many other Tarantino characters, to make his slow point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My eyes rolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FatJoe See Profile I'm a Fan of FatJoe permalink Traffic and Spider Man 3 were "good choices"? SM3 was famously bad (but successful, maybe that's all that counts) and Traffic was a bunch of 30-second policy speeches strung together in the vain hopeof making a movie -- especially Topher Grace's little screed in the car with Mike Douglas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unwatchable. brueso See Profile I'm a Fan of brueso permalink I'm sure Topher wishes he could find more "unwatchable" films like "Traffic" to participate in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Im with Brueso, fatjoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you skipped over the two films I prefer more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I admit it: Ireally dig Topher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got a very amiable persona on That 70s Show and used itwell in A Date With Tad Hamilton, proving he's got romantic comedy potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ithought his work in PS was very appealing too, though I didn't love the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ithought Spider-Man 2 was better than SM3, but Topher in particular gave a fun,nasty edge to his role in Venom (no one I know complained about Topher, just that Venom was killed off, going against all the backstory of the comics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YOu didn't think he held his own? Certainly it was a smart choice by doing well in a film that would be a blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I personally love the original miniseries Traffik and really didn't care for Soderbergh's condensed film version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, it was a strong commercial hit, got Oscar nominations, and Topher had a good supporting role undercutting his goody-goody image from That 70s Show and letting people knowhe was up for anything, not just leading man roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course his character wasSUPPOSED to be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the best of the batch is In Good Company, avery underappreciated drama, even though it did good box office and got very goodreviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Jack Lemmon's best work, I think it commented on corporate Americaand gave Topher his most complex, interesting role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really think he has potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:14 AM on 10/17/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:19 PM on 10/17/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:14 PM on 10/16/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:06 PM on 10/16/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:20 AM on 10/17/2007Michael Giltz: DVDs: Can Someone Save Hilary Swank From Herself? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-can-someone-save-hi_b_68667.html [4/5/2009 8:33:18 PM]ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type</p>
