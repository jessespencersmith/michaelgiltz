                <p>Newer Post Older PostSATURDAY, MAY 02, 2015 The Best Books Of All Time -- The Master List Of Books I've Read By Rating Updated December 31, 2020 Here's a very incomplete master list of books I've read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is my list by rating (so you can see which books I gave a perfect four out of four stars to, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've got another list organized by author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tend to focus on good books or authors I've read a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't see the point of including a book I didn't like by someone most people haven't heard about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've only got year-by-year lists of my reading going back to 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before that, it's very catch as catch can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since I've also considerably winnowed down my personal library without noting the books I got rid of over the years, I don't even have a good record of the books I SAVED for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So please understand that this isn't remotely comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I seem overly generous in the number of 3 1/2 and 4 star books, well those are simply the ones I remember best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The many minor books I consumed over the years (especially reams and reams of sci-fi, fantasy and mysteries) have faded from memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as often, if a book is so bad it would only get 1 1/2 or fewer stars, I didn't bother finishing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the point? Any weird gaps (I've read a lot more Dickens than I've listed, for example) are usually because I don't remember with enough specificity what I thought of certain books to rate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Art Garfunkel and Peter Bogdanovich had the right idea! Keep a list, everyone; you'll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I wouldn't give for index cards with my brief thoughts on the movies I watched, books I read, albums I heard from a young age onward....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
