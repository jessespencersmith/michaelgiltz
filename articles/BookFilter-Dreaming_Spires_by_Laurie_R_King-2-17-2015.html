(Holmes has always had a soft spot for nobility, I'd say.) One is alwaystempted to begin a series at the beginning, but newcomers should feel free to dive in. -- Michael GiltzWhat Others SayPraise for Dreaming Spies “[Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell’s] unusual partnership is, as always, a delight to observe, and [Laurie R.] Kingexpertly combines rich historical detail, deftly drawn characters and taut suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Holmes fans, mystery loversand those interested in either Japan or Oxford, this novel is a multilayered and entirely enjoyable journey.”—ShelfAwareness “Compulsively readable . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through astute, precise, and elegant writing, great attention to time and place, andbeautifully realized characters, King has created a mystery series that is at once intelligent, reflective, and actionfilled.”—Library Journal “A story that keeps the reader enthralled . . . one of the most consistently outstanding mystery series out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anytime spent with the Russell-Holmes duo is a delight.”—Booklist “Snappy prose and a captivating plot distinguish King’s fourteenth novel featuring Mary Russell and her husband,Sherlock Holmes. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many will find the character deepened by his partnership with the spirited…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
