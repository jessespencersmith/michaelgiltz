                <p>arts&amp;eatertainmeat .------------- ----~------ ---------------------------- B,D, Wong was thrilled by Pacific Overtures when he was a kid, Now he's in the lead By Michael Giltz urely it's fate that B.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wong would star in the first BroadÂ­ way revival of Stephen SondÂ­ heim's Pacific Overtures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, it's the show that conÂ­ vinced the Tony-winning Wong that he could be an actor in the first place. "It came through San Francisco right after it closed on Broadway," says Wong during a break from rehearsals for the show, which opens on December 2. "I chased [the star) Mako down the street after the performance and got his autoÂ­ graph on my Playbill and kept it forever." Wong is also busy editing Social Grace, the first film he has directed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somewhere in between, he films episodes of Law &amp; Order: Special VicÂ­ tims Unit and, of course, cares for his 4-year-old son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of this activity he THE ADVOCATE I 64 I DECEMBER 7, 2004 traces to seeing Pacific Overtures that first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 42-year-old Wong struggles to exÂ­ plain exactly what that moment meant: "It meant that if I wanted to be an actor-which I did; I was extremely pasÂ­ sionate about school plays-and I was cursed-and you know I use the word with tongue in cheek-in my body and in my race, I was not going to be banished to a life of playing horrible, menial, emÂ­ barrassing, and demeaning roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was energized with a sense of hope." Wong-who shot to fame and won every award in sight with his legendary Broadway turn as a gender-bending spy in M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butterfly-says the most exÂ­ citing part of this show is getting to work with Sondheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He explains pasÂ­ sionately why having the show helmed by a Japanese director, Amon MiyamoÂ­ to, lets Pacific Overtures resonate in ways it never did before. "It's similar to the idea that gay actors give gay roles more resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A brilliant nongay actor can be brilliant in a gay part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet there's something that often hapÂ­ pens when a gay actor plays a gay role that is extremely powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pain is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The joy is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And any gay perÂ­ son can identify it immediately." Wong is loath to discuss his private life other than to say that he and his longÂ­ time partner Richie (who have apparentÂ­ ly broken up and reportedly no longer live together) love and respect each other and are taking their son together on interviews for kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wong doesn't hesitate to say that coming out in The Advocate in June 2003 was a powerful, positive experience. "I've come to the point very recentÂ­ ly-in the last five years, definitely--of fully understanding that who I am is a great thing," he says. "I don't mean I'm better than anyone else, but I used to really bemoan my gayness and my Asian-ness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were intertwined inÂ­ extricably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could not separate what bothered me more about myself, what gave me more pain." How did it change? "The core of that is parenthood," says Wong. "The fatherÂ­ hood led to coming out, and coming out led to feeling extremely liberated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The coming-out released me from shame, and releasing myself from shame helped me to ... see, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To see me through [my son's) eyes? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just very positive." â€¢</p>
