(Besides, rumor has it the Funny Girl revival is back on with the young actress we all want to see in that role, so what better time to celebrate the original?) Streisand: In the Camera Eye by James Spada ($40, Harry N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abrams) collects more than 170 images of this icon by some of the greatest photographers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stunning, gorgeous, striking â€” and thatâ€™s just the cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, that friend of yours has the complete Shakespeare plays and can quote a sonnet at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But does he have this? William Shakespeareâ€™s Star Wars Trilogy: The Royal Box Set by Ian Doescher ($44.85, Quirk) sounds ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shakespeare? Star Wars ?

Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.For some people, the idea of getting on a stage and facing an audience isnâ€™t comforting â€” itâ€™s terrifying! In the charming new picture book Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wayneâ€™s Masterpiece , written and illustrated by Patricia Polacco ($17.99, Putnam), thatâ€™s the very dilemma faced by Polacco as she remembers a childhood nightmare: drama class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, the instructor lets her work on painting the setsrather than playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But guess what happens when the lead actress suddenly movesaway and Polacco is the only one who knows her lines? Any child will enjoy the book, thoughbudding thespians (and those who shudder at the thought) will be especially tickled, as will any adult who stumbles through a toast or having to give a presentation at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.Misty Copeland was never shy about being in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just out in paperback is Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina ($15.99, Touchstone), the story of her remarkable career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Copeland has gone from a 13-year-old girl sleeping on a hotel room floor with her many siblings to only the third African American soloist dancing at the American Ballet Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her tale isgripping, from overcoming obstacles to the immense challenges of a life as a prima ballerina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fierce fans of dance and casual fans of Billy Elliot will savor this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hereâ€™s another gorgeous art book, this one celebrating the many talents of Mexican artist Miguel Covarrubias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not familiar with him? You should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was a set designer, a brilliant caricaturist,and an art historian, among many other talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covarrubias designed the set and costumes for La Revue Negre, the show that made Josephine Baker a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He came to New York, drew countless covers for The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, befriended Eugene Oâ€™Neill, chronicled the jazz scene in Harlem with his drawings, influenced Al Hirschfeld among others, and went on to brilliant work as a painter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miguel Covarrubias: Drawing a Cosmopolitan Life ($55, University of Texas Press) is a catalog linked to a major exhibition of his work at the Georgia Oâ€™KeefeMuseum (running through mid-January) that will hopefully travel the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until then, you can start with this to appreciate his wide-ranging talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick waysto buy this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Covarrubias, everyone knows Alan Cumming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But do they know him well?

Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But author Lois Leveen cannily tells the backstory of Shakespeareâ€™s Romeo &amp; Juliet through the eyes of Angelica, that young loverâ€™s boon companion from birth. (And the character with the most lines, after its doomed duo.) In doing so, with Julietâ€™s Nurse ($25.99, Atria/Emily Bestler Books) Leveen creates a novel that inevitably leads up to one of the great romantic tragedies in theatrical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she illuminates the emotional roller coaster of a wet nurse, in this case a woman whose ownchild dies the same day Juliet is born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite naturally, Angelica finds herself emotionally andphysically bonded to the baby as if Juliet were her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itâ€™s an impressive work lovers of Shakespeare in particular will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether you go to every show on Broadway (if only!) or head to the Great White Way once every few years or catch the big shows when they tour in your town, thereâ€™s no better way to capture the entire season than The Playbill Broadway Yearbook June 2013â€“May 2014 ($39.99, Playbill/Applause).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This annual covers every show on Broadway during that season â€”not just the new debuts, but long-running hits as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it covers everything, from head shotsof everyone in the show to extensive credits, descriptions, critical and box office info, backstagedish that might come from anyone involved in the production (be it one of the showâ€™s stars or achoreographer or the guy working the lights high up in the rafters), and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyonetakes their Playbill home after attending a show; now you can take a Playbill home for the entire season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Letâ€™s end with a legend: Judi Dench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone loves this no-nonsense actress, whether onstage, screen, or film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But surely Dench is above all a star of the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her name equalsautomatic box office in London or New York like few others and has for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dench already wrote a memoir years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now she offers Behind the Scenes ($29.99, St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martinâ€™s Press).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filled with images, itâ€™s like sitting with Dench while you both look through her scrapbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She shares witty and blunt anecdotes about her career, telling whatever story the well-chosen photos bringto mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itâ€™s disarming, fun, and catnip for fans of this brilliant talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She hasnâ€™t been onBroadway since her Tony-winning turn in Amyâ€™s View in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sheâ€™ll always be ready for a command performance with this in your collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click here for more info and quick ways to buy this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder of BookFilter.com, a site where you can discover new releasesevery week in every category, along with curated picks on the books worthy of your time, just like the ones he recommended above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giltz is a freelance journalist who has written thousands of features, reviews, and cover stories about theater and the arts for numerous nationalpublications including Huffington Post, New York Daily News, New York Post, Los AngelesTimes, Entertainment Weekly, The Advocate and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KEEP READING: A Christmas Story and Rent to Receive Live TV ProductionsSneak Peek: Sunday in the Park with GeorgeSEE ALL NEWS Join Our Newsletter General Info Find Shows Broadway Venues Tony Winner Idina Menzel Set for Off-Broadway Premiere of Skintight</p>
