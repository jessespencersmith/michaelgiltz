What did Cruise do? Unfortunately, we have no idea because this brief item doesn't even begin to describe how Tom Cruise beat Charlie Sheen out for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All it does is quote that ten year old article from Playboy in which Sheen says hewas promised the role by Stone and then Stone didn't even call him back to say the role wasn't Sheen'sanymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then The Hollywood Reporter rather randomly quotes author and host of Studio 360 KurtAndersen who says Sheen's career would have "peaked higher" and the movie would have "workedbetter" if Sheen had indeed played the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's literally it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sheen told Playboy that both De NIro and Pacino wanted the role, according to Stone, but he was gonna give it to Sheen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never mind that De NIro and Pacino are about 20 years older than Sheen and Cruise and clearly too old for the part as played in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So his story seems a little fishy, though it's reasonable to assume he was considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Sheen was already put through the horrors of war in Platoon and so having him do the same in Born would have had less impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Stone was right to cast Cruise; he was still glowing with the All American promise of Top Gun so seeing him paralyzed and bitter worked far better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Platoon seems a little more schematic than it did at the time in its tale of good versus evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it has an impressive attention to detailand still captures the intensity and confusion of battle as well as any film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what do you think? Would Born On The Fourth Of July been better if it had starred Charlie Sheen? And would his career have gone down a different path if he had? FORGET THE FILM, WATCH THE TITLES ($27.99; Submarine) -- A good idea is poorly executed in this DVD that focuses on the title sequences that start off many movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first DVD features more than 30 titles sequences from movies, tv shows, games and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second DVD features nine shortdocumentaries focusing on the people behind certain title sequences and how they created them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You canprobably remember some title sequences after a moment's thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The James Bond films have the mostfamous title sequences of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent years, Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can was an instant classic of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like trailers and film scores, the title sequence is a worthy subject for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, this set doesn't contain the best title sequences in recent years, but apparently any that they could get the rights to display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How else to explain this grab-bag of mostly unimpressive titlesequences? Instead of James Bond, you get the Bond spoof OSS 117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies (one of the best featured here and also featured in the making-of section but no substitute for Bond, James Bond).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whyso many little-known European films? They're certainly not great examples of the form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love the hitmovie Goodbye Lenin! but wasn't wowed by its title sequence either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is the only big Hollywood film featured here and it too is a rather dull example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HBO's The Life and Deathof Peter Sellers is a wittier high profile offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The B movie Splice starring Adrien Brody? Also a dull, uninteresting title sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, the rights to the best title sequences just weren't available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butsurely then they should have held off on the DVD or focused on more classic examples from earlierdecades that presumably would have been there for the taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW USSigns Your Husband Is GayKirstie Alley Walks NYFW The Alexander Wang PartyKnightley Gets Dangerous Like 117K Like 93 Like 64K Like 2K Like 453 Like 2K Like 111 Like 3K Like 1KRIZZOLI &amp; ISLES COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ($39.98; Warner Bros.) -- Why do some shows just click immediately with audiences? In the case of Rizzoli &amp; Isles , it's not the police procedural genre or the Boston setting or the writing that makes this special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So clearly it's the chemistry between the two leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You just buy Angie Harmon as a detective and Sasha Alexander as her medical examiner bestfriend and want to visit them every week as they solve crime after crime in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now with this a basiccable hit (new episodes begin July 11), isn't it about time they put out the entire Cagney &amp; Lacey on DVD? DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES ($39.99 BluRay combo pack or $29.99 regular; FOX) -- Like the graphic novels they're based on, these movies are harmless fun about kids in school trying toget through their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The secret to their success is that they don't focus on the prettiest, smartest, mostathletic or the most wizardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just normal kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd rank this one slightly higher than the first because itfeatures more of our hero's cruel older brother Rodrick (played with glee by Devon Bostick), but they're essentially interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

Because everyone involved claimed credit for its achievements.And here's why the film is worth mentioning today: it contains an almost unseemly amount of young talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some movies can boast of great casting, of including a group of actors in front of the camera who would go on to great heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So surely People On Sunday is one of the great assemblages of young talent behind the camera, including Robert Siodmak, Edgar G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ulmer, Fred Zinnemann, cinematographer Eugen Schufftan (already as established name) and Billy Wilder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extras include a 2000 documentary about the making of the film, Schufftan's similar 35 minute short Ins Blaue Hinein , two scores and a thoughtful essay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ERASING DAVID ($24.98; FilmBuff) -- I need to give my friend S. this movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not using my friend's full name or even his first name because he is concerned about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hates the idea ofkeeping his info in the "cloud" because then Google or Amazon or Apple or whomever could look at itwhenever they want, he said. (Not true, of course and you can encrypt your information before you put itonline in the cloud.) But I'm not saying my friend is wrong; I'm saying he's not paranoid enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisdocumentary shows filmmaker David Bond trying to go off the grid for just one month while payingprivate detectives to track him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not surprisingly, it's a LOT harder to do than he imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to get truly worried about how little privacy we have left thanks to our online footprints and cameras on the street recording our every movie and Google Maps having a picture of our home at theworld's disposal, then start here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BARNEY'S VERSION ($38.96 BluRay/DVD combo; Sony Pictures Classics) -- Actor Paul Giamatti HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Video Weird Animals Astronomy Food Fashion Scott Brown Buy a link here Sponsored Links Hyatt Summerfield SuitesÂ® All Suites Hotel with a Full Kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Breakfast &amp; Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book Now Hyatt.com/SummerfieldSuites What is Scientology Think For Yourself and Find Out for Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientology.org #1 Snoring Solution New solution that allows medical insurance to pay for remedy. www.WhyYouNeedtoKnow.com 'Terrified' Chaz Bono Haters She's Baaaaaaaack!

This forces me to NEVER watchBritish TV shows on PBS when trimmed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have to wait angrily for the DVDs and PBS loses out onmy viewership and everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I'm catching up with Julia McKenzie in her secondround of TV movies as Miss Marple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get four mysteries, all about 88 minutes in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extrasinclude an earlier TV movie version of The Pale Horse and a documentary about Agatha Christie'sgarden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that intrigues you, then you've probably already ordered this set online to arrive at your homeas soon as possible and could tell me at length why McKenzie is terrible/wonderful/miscast/perfect in her role as Miss Marple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll stick to my modest expertise in the various Sherlock Holmes that I've seen and keep my opinion of McKenzie to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out from Acorn is George Gently Series 3 ($39.99; Acorn), a current TV series set in the 1960s which has a grieving widower at its heart, giving the show an interesting mournful air quite different from other cop shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust the British to take their time: this season contains just two mysteries, eachabout 90 minutes long, one set on a campus and the other delving into the life of a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Shawstars as Gently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'M DIRTY! &amp; I STINK! ($19.95; Scholastic/New Video) -- It seemed like the epitome of laziness -- DVDs to read picture books to your kids? But in fact, the read-along DVDs don't replace an adult readingto their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an adjunct and a safe, entertaining DVD you can watch together or let them enjoy whenyou're busy doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, when you do sit down to read the story of a garbage truck toyour child, they may challenge you to do as good a job as Andy Richter does here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This two DVD set Kanye West Barack Obama Maria Shriver MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â»contains 12 stories read by Richter, Steve Buscemi, Forest Whitaker and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE FAR PAVILIONS ($29.99; Acorn) -- It may seem strange now, but once upon a time the idea of HBO creating original movies and miniseries was a bold, questionable idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They led with quality, spending a record $12 million (the most ever for a cable movie) and drawing a cast that included BenCross, Amy Irving, Christopher Lee, John Gielgud, Rupert Everett and Omar Sharif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result may havebeen a bit stiff and not a patch on the bestselling novel by M.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaye, but it was a notable first step asHBO's first miniseries and the sign of things to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does notguarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover eachweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does notobligate him in any way to speak positively about their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Buy a link here Sponsored Links Hyatt Summerfield SuitesÂ® All Suites Hotel with a Full Kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Breakfast &amp; Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book Now Hyatt.com/SummerfieldSuites What is Scientology Think For Yourself and Find Out for Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientology.org #1 Snoring Solution New solution that allows medical insurance to pay for remedy. www.WhyYouNeedtoKnow.com College - 100% Online Be more employable!
