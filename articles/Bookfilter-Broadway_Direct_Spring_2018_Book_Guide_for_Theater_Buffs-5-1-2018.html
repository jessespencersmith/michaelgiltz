What to do? Imean, you’ve already watched the latest episode of the TV series Rise .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you’re not heading to a show tonight or even if you simply have hours to kill before curtain, books abouttheater are always waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMETHING WONDERFUL: RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN’S BROADWAY REVOLUTION BOOKFILTER’S SPRING BOOK GUIDE FOR THEATER BUFFS MICHAEL GILTZ | MAY 1, 2018 SHARE By Todd S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purdum $32, Henry Holt &amp; CoThis brisk and lively biography of the greatest team in musical-theater history remains happily focused on what matters most: the shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Todd S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purdum begins by covering their livesand careers up to that fateful partnership, reminding us that Oscar Hammerstein (Show Boat ) and Richard Rodgers (Rodgers &amp; Hart) had already accomplished enough to be rememberedforever even before they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Purdum devotes about a chapter to each major work and theincreasing activity that surrounds colossal success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein were the boldestand most fascinating of talents, pushing boundaries on what stories a musical could tell, howthey would tell them, and doing it all with songs that are so precise and deceptively simple thateveryone can sing them and yet they reveal passionate depths in the right hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purdumdoesn’t shy away from the personal, like Hammerstein’s insecurities, Rodgers chasing aftershowgirls, or battles with depression and alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it’s always in the context of howpersonal matters affected their relationship and their shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something Wonderful doesn’t rock the boat with any unexpected claims for this show or damning of that work, but it’s a solid,affectionate description of artists who look more important today than at any time since, oh,1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE STORY PIRATES PRESENT: STUCK IN THE STONE AGE By Geoff Rodkey, Based on an Original Idea by Real Kid Vince Boberski $13.99, Rodale KidsThe Story Pirates are the famous arts company that uses improv and theater to educate and entertain children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They began with comics improvising shows based on stories written by kids.That led to branches in New York and L.A., the Story Pirates podcast, tours, and now even achildren’s book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like their shows, it leaps from an idea by a kid — this time, Vince Boberski —and then the fun begins, along with oh-so-casual descriptions of how the novel was crafted, thetechniques they used, the choices they made, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Utterly original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dubbed Monty Pythonmeets Schoolhouse Rock, no wonder they’re a favorite of Jon Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YEAR OF THE MAD KING By Antony Sher $26, Nick Hern BooksAntony Sher is touring the world with an acclaimed new production of King Lear, a performance this legendary actor insists is his final Shakespeare play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a pity that would be, though, truly, Sher has tackled most of the Bard’s major roles through his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He shot toprominence with a groundbreaking spin on Richard III, and Sher’s fame was doubled by thediary he kept and published about the creation of that show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His new diary — Year of the MadKing — follows in its footsteps, combining a backstage diary of the ups and downs of a theatrical life with keen insights into Shakespeare and how Sher crafted his performance.Absolutely essential for fans of Sher, Shakespeare, and the theater, but above all for actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sothat covers pretty much everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOOLS AND MORTALS By Bernard Cornwell $27.99, HarperBestselling author Bernard Cornwell is known for a string of rousing historical adventures, ranging from those starring the rapscallion Richard Sharpe (set during the Napoleonic Wars) tonovels about the search for the Holy Grail to the reign of Alfred the Great and even a series setduring the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he’s thrown his many fans off-kilter with his latest standalonenovel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Called Fools and Mortals, it stars William Shakespeare’s younger brother Richard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has fled a brutal apprenticeship and seeks refuge in Will’s company, playing modest female parts …until rescuing some stolen manuscripts rewards Dick with the standout role of Mercutio inRomeo &amp; Juliet .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filled with Cornwell’s typically scrupulous attention to historical detail, this is a delightful change of pace and should garner him a whole new set of fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAILING UP By Leslie Odom Jr. $19.99, Feiwel &amp; FriendsThe remarkable original cast of Hamilton has spread out to conquer everything from TV to music and film and, of course, theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tony winner Leslie Odom Jr. might just do all of that, and now he’s tossed in books for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this memoir/self-help guide, Odom uses thecommencement address speech as a way to share how he struggled, fought, and “failed up” onhis way to Hamilton and the role of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He debuted on Broadway at the age of 17 in Rent (another show with a historic original cast) and hasn’t looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOMENT WORK By Moisés Kaufman and Barbara Pitts McAdams $18, VintageThe Tectonic Theatre Project has created some of the most innovative works around, including legendary shows such as Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde and The LaramieProject .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They’ve done it through a collaborative process called Moment Work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, the founder and artistic director, Moisés Kaufman, partners with Barbara Pitts McAdams, the dramaturge ofThe Laramie Project and Tectonic teaching artist, to share in detail how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a behind-the-scenes glimpse into major works that came to be along with a practical guide forthose who want to embrace Moment Work themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOLDED NOTES FROM HIGH SCHOOLBy Matthew Boren $17.99, RazorbillIs there more drama anywhere than a high school theater program? No, there is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this lighthearted take on the Heathers and Regina Georges of the world, we are introduced to Tara,the queen of her high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has a superhot jock boyfriend and the lead role of Sandy in Grease to top off the perfect senior year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only problem is that a freshman named Matthew Bloom — a freshman! — has won the role of Danny Zuko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, he’s amazingly talented, andreally, she has to admit he’s kind of dazzlingly cute, but he’s a freshman and she’s a senior and never the twain shall meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if Tara finds herself volunteering to do scene work with thisMatthew, why, it’s only to make sure he doesn’t spoil her final triumph and it has absolutelynothing to do with her falling hard for his charms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UNMASKED: A MEMOIR By Andrew Lloyd Webber $28.99, HarperWell, he certainly dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One might have feared the knighted Andrew Lloyd Webber would have taken himself and his outrageously successful career too much to heart, lording it (or atleast “sir”-ing it) all over us poor peasants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he was a fan of theater before he dove into it,and Lloyd Webber knows memoirs are for telling stories, especially the naughty ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedoesn’t hold back in this survey of his career, from the schoolboy romp of adapting a story fromthe Bible (a lark that became an actual musical!) right up to the now-and-forever success ofPhantom of the Opera .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, this juicy memoir stops with Lloyd Webber right at his peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sequel will surely be coming, and with the misses outpacing the hits from then on out, it will befascinating to see if he can dish on himself as insightfully as he does everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides,doesn’t everyone want to hear his take on kissing and making up with Patti LuPone? THE LUCK OF FRIENDSHIP Edited by Peggy L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox and Thomas Keith $39.95, W.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norton &amp; CompanyTennessee Williams remains an obsessively fascinating character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely no major playwright has been as compulsively written about, dramatized, and fictionalized as he.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new play hittingOff-Broadway tackles the meeting between Williams and William Inge, a key moment in theirlives when the two closeted playwrights were just starting out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Summer and Smoke is getting a new mounting at the Classic Stage Company, and the same can surely be said about countlessother works by him all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So any time is a good time for books about Williams,and this one collects the letters between Tennessee and publisher James Laughlin of the imprintNew Directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They met at a party, bonded over a shared love of the poetry of Hart Crane,and became lifelong friends and pen pals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laughlin published all of the plays by Williams, alongwith his novels, stories, and poetry, and they supported each other through the inevitable upsand downs of artistic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A unique angle on a major dramatist’s story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE WARNER LOUGHLIN TECHNIQUE: AN ACTING REVOLUTION By Warner Loughlin $24.99, Howland Lilley PressMust actors plumb the miserable depths of their pasts in order to dredge up emotion? As Laurence Olivier once famously said to the Method-y Dustin Hoffman, it’s called acting, my dearboy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olivier worked from the outward in, needing a prosthetic nose or a distinctive walk or acostume to find the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acting coach Warner Loughlin has another approach, and it has led tothe endorsement of artists including Ryan Reynolds, Kyra Sedgwick, and Emma Roberts, amongothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After more than 20 years of working with actors who have gone on to substantialacclaim, Loughlin details in print for the first time her approach to acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INSEPARABLE: THE ORIGINAL SIAMESE TWINS By Yunte Huang $28.95, LivewrightDid you love the movie musical The Greatest Showman ? It captured the spectacle of P.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barnum, a man who knew outcasts might be ignored until you put them in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then suddenly people would line up and pay good money to see the “freaks.” Just as Barnum washyping up his various museums/shows in New York City, the Siamese twins Chang and Engwere appearing in Boston as “exhibits.” In an amazing twist, the two earned their freedom,mounted their own shows, traveled the country, and ultimately became Southern gentry, earninga fortune, marrying two white sisters, fathering 21 children, and even enslaving other humansthe way they were once enslaved themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine Lettie Lutz (the bearded lady in the film)becoming her own boss and making more money than Barnum, and you start to appreciate theremarkable journey of these two men detailed in this work of history by Yunte Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OUR LADY OF THE PRAIRIE By Thisbe Nissen $25, Houghton Mifflin HarcourtA novel about a theater professor having a tumultuous affair during a nation-dividing presidential election? No, this is not a hot-off-the-press tale of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer Thisbe Nissen’s new corrosivelycomic novel is set during the Bush–Kerry election of 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And our wayward professor is PhillipaMaakestad, a not-so-happily-married woman who cheats on her husband while spending asemester teaching in Ohio. (Really, can you blame her?) She returns home for her “difficult”daughter’s wedding, and when everything is teetering and about to fall over, Phillipa decides togive it all a good shove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in the mix: a mother-in-law who might have been a Nazicollaborator, a tornado touching ground on the big day, and a husband who finally shows somespine when he’s been cuckolded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEAR: THE GREAT IMAGE OF AUTHORITY By Harold Bloom $24, ScribnerOne of the great Shakespearean scholars, Harold Bloom is capping off his career with intimate, deeply insightful examinations of some of the Bard’s major characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, he x-rays KingLear, with Bloom sharing his own inevitably shifting impressions of the role as they developed and sharpened and changed during decades of study and legendary performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just 176pages long, it’s a master class in erudition and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE STREET WHERE I LIVE By Alan J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lerner$17.95, W.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norton &amp; Company Often called the greatest musical of all time, My Fair Lady is returning to Broadway in a lavish new production starring Lauren Ambrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The positive buzz is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you can’t wait, appease yourself by snapping up the reissue of Alan J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lerner’s classic memoir of life inthe theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ranks with Moss Hart’s Act One as a peak peek of the Great White Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It covers three musicals: the film Gigi and the stage classics My Fair Lady and Camelot .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Need we say more?
