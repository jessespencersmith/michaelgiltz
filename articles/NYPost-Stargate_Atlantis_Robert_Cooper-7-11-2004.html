                <p>2 NYP TV WEEK Suiting up for a trip through the galaxy: Rachel Luttrell and Joe Flanigan. a o By MICHAEL GllTZ ON the new Sci Fi series "Slargate: Atlantis" - a spin-off from the quiÂ­ etly successful "Stargate SGI," which just launched its eighth season -the lost city is finally rediscovered .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But accordÂ­ Ing 10 c&lt;&gt;-cr~3IOr Roh 'n ooper, it should have OCCUlTed lljles ago. "We plannell for this t happen a couple f years ngu." says oop 'r, who "Iso helps oversee "SGt." "But we were victims of our own success because the ratings for 'SGI' kept growing on Sci Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We originally planned the spinÂ­ off to be more of a hand-off. 'SGI' would be finishing and then we would pass the baton to ''Atlantis.'' When they said they wanted both at the same time. it made us rethink the concept for the spin-off." Now, instead of one show ending and the other beginning, sci-fi fans get the best overload of entertainment since "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" aired at the same time in the early '90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the latest mark of success for "SCI," which was itsdf a spinÂ·off from the modest 1994 theatrical hit starring James Spader and Kurt Russell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led to the series debut on Show time starring Richard Dean Anderson as the leader of a team of explorers that travels through StarÂ­ gates to other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five years on Showtime and in syndication led to its reloc~tion to Sci Fi. with the show always growing in popularity both overseas (where it's a smash hit and seen in more than 60 countries) and on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show's unique appeal? The Stargate stoÂ­ ries don't take place in some distant future - they involve people who live on earth here and now who must deal with alien cultures as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cooper knows that wish fulfillment -getting to interact with other worlds right now -is at the heart of "SC!." But he knew ''Atlantis,'' especially since it would be airing at the same time as "SG\," had to be different. -I 5 'Stargate' spin-off introduces new villains, the Wraiths That's why the team in this sbow is trapped in a different galaxy and living in the lost city of Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fm from a safe \1~ven thanks to its alien technology, the lack of fdrce fields that leave it vulnerabl e to the elements and the threat of new uber-villains, the:Wrruths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In conceiving the new show, ,Cooper doesn't hesitate to name the one element of "SGI" he was happiest to jettison. "The Coa'uld," he says firmly about "SCI's" main baddies, "I find them sort of ridiculou s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's something I probably shQuldn't be sayÂ­ ing, considering I still executive produce the other show. "They're great for 'SGI' and they have a speÂ­ cific tone and feeling to them -these arroÂ­ gant, theatrical, over-the-top, weird-dressing bad guys," Cooper says. "But for me it was a lot of fun to create the Wraiths -something fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're a much more gothic, dark type of villain." The cast is populated with newcomers, including Joe Flanigan as the daring, rcbellious Maj.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Sheppard and Rachel Luttrell as Teyla, the hal, sexy leader of the Athosian race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coopcr." lifelong fan of"The Six Million DolÂ­ lar Man," confesses he approached l.indsay Wagner about playing Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elizabeth Weir, the head of the Stargate team, but ultimately decidÂ­ ed the show didn't need a name to draw viewÂ­ ers (Torri Higginson got the part).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those fans shouldn't get too att3ched to "SCI," however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looks like this could be the final season for that franchisc _ "We definitely think of the second half of this season as the series finale," Cooper admits. "There are economic s involved in moving forward to a season nine. and even to a season eight, quite frankly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've learned never to say never.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If 'SGI' docs even better than last year, it's entirely possible Sci Fi will do whatever they have to do to make [anothet season] happen."
