So we ditched tribunals more than 50 yearsago because they were unfair and inadequate and that's the systemBush wants to revive today? Why not just model ourselves on theSalem witch trials instead?And here's that lie that the panel's presiding officer Col.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PeterBrownback III was caught in."Under questioning in a hearing, Colonel Brownback stated flatly thathe had never told a group of lawyers that the detainees had anyspeedy trial rights, a statement that could have demonstrated he didnot have an open mind on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he was then told by aNavy lawyer that an audio recording of such a meeting existed, hewas stunned and said he had not been aware the meeting was beingtaped."Brownback should be dismissed from this post and given a seriousreprimand, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loans for Legal FeesLoans exclusively for the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fast onlineloans from $500-$10,000www.PioneerMilitaryLoans.comSeattle Property Rights LawSeattle real estate attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Find localbusinesses on DexKnows.www.DexKnows.comJeremiah J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sullivan, IIIMilitary Justice Worldwide Assignablewww.JeremiahSullivanLaw.com Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser Logout from DisqusLogged in asusing Facebook Connect (Logout)Type your comment here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...1 minute agoFiredoglakeSave American Jobs: Close Your Chase Account -JP Morgan Chase refuses to do what it takes tosave 300,000 jobs and the healthcare of 700,000retirees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I decided today to no longer be a partof that....36 minutes agoDaily Kos"Difference isn't a threat" - Dave Neiwert, theblogosphere's leading expert on the eliminationistmovement, has a typically excellent post about theweekend's tragic shooting at Croo...44 minutes agoEschatonDeep Thought - Why is Chris Hayes always on myteevee?46 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T VSearch Military RecordsInstant Military records lookup.Military records online database.Military.GovtRegistry.comAsk a Military Lawyer NowUCMJ Question?
