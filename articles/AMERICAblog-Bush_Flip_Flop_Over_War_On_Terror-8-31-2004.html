                <p>T U E S D A Y , A U G U S T 3 1 , 2 0 0 4Bush Flip Flop Over War On Terrorby Michael in New York on 8/31/2004 01:22:00 AMBy now, everyone has heard Bush's awkward, politically stupidcomment that you can't win the war on terror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does anyone doubtthat if Kerry had said this that Bush would have ripped him for it andthere'd be an ad on the air in every battleground state within hours?Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The White House has been desperately backpedalingand coming up with all sorts of excuses. (Our favorite was on'Nightline" where a Bush spokesperson started off by saying well,hey, he was being interviewed on a moving bus!)But the New York Times does a good job of showing how Bush's new,nuanced view of the war on terror flatly contradicts many statementshe's made in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then they twist the knife by saying his stanceis now close to that of Europe."In the interview with Matt Lauer of the NBC News program "Today,"conducted on Saturday but shown on the opening day of theRepublican National Convention, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush was asked if the UnitedStates could win the war against terrorism, which he has made thefocus of his administration and the central thrust of his re-electioncampaign."'I don't think you can win it,' Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush replied. 'But I think you cancreate conditions so that those who use terror as a tool are lessacceptable in parts of the world.'"As recently as July 14, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush had drawn a far sunnier picture. 'Ihave a clear vision and a strategy to win the war on terror,' he said."At a prime-time news conference in the East Room of the WhiteHouse on April 13, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush said: 'One of the interesting thingspeople ask me, now that we are asking questions, is, 'Can you everwin the war on terror?' Of course you can.'"It was unclear if Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush had meant to make the remark to Mr.Lauer, or if he misspoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But White House officials said the presidentwas not signaling a change in policy, and they sought to explain hisstatement by saying he was emphasizing the long-term nature of thestruggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taken at face value, however, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's words would puthim closer to the positions of the United States' European allies, whohave considered Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's talk of victory simplistic and unhelpful."
