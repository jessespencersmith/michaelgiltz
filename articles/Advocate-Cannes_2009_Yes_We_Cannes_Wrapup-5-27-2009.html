Yep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, the brochure that was distributed to the press to promote the film was by far the most lavish and eye-catching of the fest -- it looked more like a fabulous edition of Vogue than something as banal as a promotional item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almodóvar still has style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee's mild, amiable Taking Woodstock has a gay central role played by Demetri Martin, and that alone is cause for celebration among his gay fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It tells the modestly diverting story of a closeted young gay man in the 1960s helping his parents with their ramshackle Catskills hotel when Woodstock comes to town and upends their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It too barely caused a ripple even among serious Lee fans and seemed more like a throat-clearing by Lee (who had made a string of serious films)than a substantial work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Story continues on next page...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page: 1 | 2 | 3FROM THE NEWSSTAND ISSUE Forty Under 40: Dustin Lance Black Wiley World The Man Behind the Strip Honest ArthurEditor's LetterForty Under 40: Media Keep the Win at Your Back Forty Under 40: Activism So This Is London Lounge Act Lordy Lordy, Look Who’s 40: NYCCelebrates Stonewall Downturn?
