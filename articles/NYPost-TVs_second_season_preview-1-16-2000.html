                <p>By MICHAEL GILTZ Is midseason shows used to be called "replacements" -the second string backups for whatever new series failed to click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You didn't like that new cop drama? Well, here's another new cop drama we didn't think was half as good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nowadays, it seems like the networks are saving the best for last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why Fox announced "Malcolm in the Middle" during the fall preview sea­ son but waited to launch it in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its reward? crit­ ical raves and the biggest premiere numbers for that network since "The SimP80ns" in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If"Malcolm" stays on a roll (and Fox doesn't cut the legs out from under it the way they did "King of the Hill"), it will join a long list of mid­ season superstars : "Seinfeld," "Third Rock From the Sun," "The Practice." and even "All the Family" all debuted during the winter. "Malcolm will be joined in the next few months by more than a dozen comedies and dramas and a whole lot of indeci­ sion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? First, a lot more of the faIl crop has survived than any of the networks expected . (CBS probably already had a replacement for "Family Law" all picked out until that show turned into a hit.) Second, the game shows meant to smother "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" are doing gangbusters. "Greed" is a mod- est, less-embarrassing timeslot filler for Fox than those police chase videos; and "Twenty One" looks like a certifiable hit for NBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watch for "What"s My Line," "The 64,000 Question" and Britain's "Mastermind" come sum­ mer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But every hit game show means one less slot for orig­ inal programming .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why for most of the shows waiting in the wings. a firm time slot or air date is still a work-in-progress .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully , the shows cov-NEW YORK POST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUNDAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JANUARY 16. 2000 TVSundav ~------------------------------------- ;7. ered below won't be a work­ in-progress as welL Here's what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE ANIMATION Toon Town -the fic­ tional citv in "Vlho Framed Rug"r R"l&gt;bit" - must be enjoying n'curd luw unemploym ent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuul' new animated shuwsjc)in tile burgl.'Oning cUitoon rHllk~ of priml'tinlc-far more t han eve.)" before in histOl)'.

"Clerks" (ABC) is based on the profanity-laced indie nick by Kevin Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But turning the story of four guys in the dead-end world of convenience stores and New Jersey isn't as odd as it . sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith has already penned' a line of comic books based on the movie; he also set his critical hit, "Cha:;ing Amy: in the world of graphic novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look for less cu ..

"Sammy" (NBC) is cer­ tainly not for the little ones, . with David Spade of "Just ' Shoot Me" the creative force ' behind this autobiographi- . cal series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it. he plays the star of a sexy sitcom who S C ./' i· I fother pops up to cash in on his son's suddcn fame, Onc plus for viewers: two vocies come courte.y of Mal,lJ':! Ticrney and Andy Dick, stars of the late, lamented "NcwsRadio. " MORE LAW ANO DISORDER "Battery Park" (NBC) is the latest half hour comedy . from Gary David Goldberg, the producer behind "Spin City," "Family Ties," and "Brooklyn Bridge." It's pitched as a distaff "Barney Miller." with Elizabeth Perkins as the captain of detective s working in New York City, "Falcone" (CBS) has had more troubles than a crimi· nal featured on "America"s Most Wanted." First, the relatively violent drama - based on the film "Donnie BraS(."Q" -was pulled from the fall schedulc. (Yct anot.h­ er tragic school shooting gave thc nctwork cold feet.) Now scheduled for mid­ season, this atory about undercover agents infiltrat­ ing thc mob has watchcd "'Thc Sopranos' get Ix,tter rc,\"ip\\'s t han -TIlt' Godfather ." CBS obviously wonts to give "Falcone" as much space between it and Tony Soprano as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, that may mean delaying it for the next five years. "TIte Beat" (UPN) has the best pedigree of any show on UPN, thc network that has "We Love Stone Cold Steve Austin" tattooed on its Nielsen rating reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another cop show (set in Ncw York, naturally), it l"Qmps from Tom Fontana lind Bart',"" L('vil1~on NEW YORK POST, SUNDAY, JANUARY 16, 2000 TVSundav ("Homicide;" ·01,").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stylish and ofTbcat, it has the schizophrenic quality of CBS"s "Now nnd Again"­ switching gears from "Miami Vice" glitter to "Cops"-likc realism with nary a second thought, MORE HOSPITALS "Wonderland" (ABC) is about the cases dealt with in a psychiatric hospital (set in New York City, natural­ ly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot like a documentary , it's written, directed and produced by Pewr Berg of "Chicago Hope." "City of Angel .... (CBS) has its debut tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like cvery TV show or movie with a predomin antly black cast, this innercity hospital drama is being unfairly positioned as yet another . make-or-break test. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it suc&lt;;reds (like "The Cosby Sho,y" or "Waiting to Emal,,") the show will be seen 'as an exception .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If ~t fails (like "Belo,'ed" or any .' number of dramas) it will be seen as proof positive that "black" shows don't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sexy cast led by Blair Underwood nnd Vivien A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fnx ,houl&lt;1 Iwlp. ..,-­ MORE SEXY YOUNG PEOPLE 1\\'0 of the better shows from thc fall season wcre part of the teen flood: the terrific "Freaks and Gccks' on NBC and "Popular" (0 slow-building performer for WB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the others quickly failed, but more keep coming. "Brutally Normal" (WB) is a single-camera .(reod: ambitious) sitcom about three boys coming of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No period piece (like "Freaks," . which is set in thc "SO.) and no earnestness (like "Dawson"s Creek").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what's the hook? Fantasy sequences a la "Ally McBeal." And if they're any­ thing like the fantasies of most teenage boys, maybe this should have bcen on cable. "MYOB" (NBC) stars a strect-savvy runaway (Katherine Townc) who moves in with her lonely­ hearts aunt living in a small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cultures clash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think of J('I1'S cantankcr­ ous relationship with her grandmother on "Dawson"" Creek" but with less angst and more punchlines .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE ODDS AND ENDS "Grapevi ne" (CBS) had a summer run in '92, bufthat won't stop people from labelling it a ·Sex and the City" for Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Originally a .

"I Dare You" (UPN)' showcases daredevil stunts, with Evel Kneivel Jr. as host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, just because Fox swore off crashing jumbo jets in the desert doesn't mean every­ one else has to as well. "Titus" (Fox) has what seems like the most origi­ nal idea nf midseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a sitcom -starrillg 0'1 adult -and based on the routine . of a stand-up comic! .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since "Titus' isn't one of 20 sitcoms doing the very same thing, that actually seems a little fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on the jokes of Christopher Titus, it costnr" St"' ·~· Kl'n('h as his dud.</p>
