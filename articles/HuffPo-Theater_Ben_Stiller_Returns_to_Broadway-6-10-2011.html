I was looking forward eagerly to this production since I missed the legendary 1986 version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what looked good on paper looks merely flat on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, if Abbott proves the find he appears to be in thatone riveting scene, the show will be able to hold its head high and say, "You saw him here first." Just likethey did with Ben Stiller so many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note: Michael Giltz was provided with tickets to this show with the understanding that he would bewriting a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Sponsored Links Mom Is 55, Looks 30...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clever Mom Reveals $5 Wrinkle Trick That Has Botox Doctors Furious!
