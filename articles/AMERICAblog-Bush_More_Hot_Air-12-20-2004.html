                <p>M O N D A Y , D E C E M B E R 2 0 , 2 0 0 4Bush: More Hot Airby Michael in New York on 12/20/2004 01:25:00 PMI love this story in the New York Times about a UN conferenceon the clear and present danger of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush, ofcourse, refused to sign off on the Kyoto Protocol or even takethe opportunity when more than a hundred nations werepoised to act and come up with a plan that the U.S. couldagree on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, when we're merely OBSERVING a discussion onthat accord and what's next, Bush spitefully blocks efforts forother nations to begin more substantive discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In otherwords, we don't want to take part and we don't want any ofYOU to take part either."This is a new low for the United States, not just to pull out,but to block other countries from moving ahead on their ownpath," said Jeff Fiedler, an observer representing theWashington-based Natural Resources Defense Council, to theNYTimes. "It's almost spiteful to say, 'You can't move aheadwithout us.' If you're not going to lead, then get out of theway."Needless to say, the rest of the world is annoyed.But you haven't heard the best part yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The one action thatBush DID support was Saudi Arabia's demand that it be paid alot of money for any switch by nations from environment-destroying oil to other forms of energy!"Delegations and observer groups also criticized what theydescribed as an effort led by Saudi Arabia and supported bythe United States to hamper approval of so-called adaptationassistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That term refers to payments that richer countrieswould make, mostly to poor, low-lying island countries to helpthem cope with the impacts of climate change," reports theNYTimes."But the issue was complicated by Saudi Arabia's insistencethat the aid include compensation to oil-producingcountries for any fall in revenues that may result fromthe reduction in the use of carbon fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EuropeanUnion, which had announced its intention to provide $400million a year to an assistance fund, strongly opposed any suchprovision."Can you imagine? Saudi Arabia keeps more than half itspopulation enslaved, with a small minority living ininimaginable luxury and does nothing to improve the lot of itsnation with money literally pouring in for generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And theywant to be compensated if the world turns its back on oil forsafer, cleaner, renewable energy sources?
