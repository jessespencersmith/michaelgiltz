Entertaining company at the time, Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban can't quite process thecreature's presence but she senses his desperation, his loneliness, his hunger for...affection? She stashes him in the guestroom and what soon follows is one of the odder romances you'll read, complete with late night drives to the beach,strolling through parks hand in webbed hand (after dark, of course) and plans to flee together to Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's daft, sweet, dangerous and you're never quite sure if it's actually happening or just a figment of Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban's imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is gentler and lovelier than you might expect, though not without its share of monster fury, violence, confusion, betrayal andheartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with many fairy tales, even the happiest-seeming stories become rather grim. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say A masterpiece and totally off the wall. - Electric Literature It's not just Disney that can ruminate on romance between a beauty and a beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this reissue of Rachel Ingalls' 1982 novel, housewife Dorothy hears on the radio that a potentially dangerous monster has just escaped aresearch facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when the creature walks through her door, he awakens something new in her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is ourpick for feminist social satire that's deliciously weird. - Estelle Tang Elle Every volume Rachel Ingalls has written displays the craft of a quite remarkable talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tales of love, terror, betrayal and grief, which others would spin out for hundreds of pages, are given the occluded force of poetry. - Independent The love story is a delight, the social commentary sharp, the writing funny and fun—and yet the sorrow, even bitterness, at the core of this book about our perfidious species is inescapable and profound. - Kirkus [A] slim surrealist masterpiece. - LA Times By marrying domestic realism with the literature of the bizarre, Ingalls brings tenderness to the monstrous andrenders the recognizable utterly weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Compact yet capacious, the novel wonders at all the ways we can desireand destroy one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s unabashedly campy and deadly serious; it dares the reader to admit that theseaims are not at all at odds. - Literary Hub A love affair with a 6-foot-7-inch amphibian might not be every woman’s fantasy, but for Dorothy—the lonelyhousewife at the center of this soon-to-be-reissued 1982 novel—it’s working out just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A short, funny, bizarrenovel that’s worth your time. - Los Angeles Magazine In her best work, Ingalls is as monochromatic as Edgar Allan Poe, going straight to her target with the same easeand surety as an arrow skims to its bull's-eye...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And just as Poe's craft was exactly suited to the conventions ofthe short story form, so Ingalls' vision is exactly suited to the length and scope of the novella...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Poe, RachelIngalls is more than a master storyteller: She is also a superb artist. - Los Angeles Times Ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ingalls is an experienced writer of novels and stories, and her perfor-mances are immensely skillful,reminiscent of the best film thrillers. - Ursula K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Le Guin The New York Times Rachel Ingalls has created a tight, intriguing portrait of a woman's escape from unacceptable reality andpresented an account of derangement so matter-of- fact, so ordinary and at the same time so bizarre, thatthrough her words we experience new insight. - The New York Times Book Review As deranged as the whole thing is, Ingalls’s prose, strikingly austere, taps into a profound sadness, too: Is Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban a work of fantasy or are we inhabiting the psyche of a woman unhinged? ...Begs to be read over and over again. - The Paris Review Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban is one of my favorite novels in the world. - Daniel Handler I loved Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So deft and austere in its prose, so drolly casual in its fantasy, but opening up into a deepfemale sadness that makes us stare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An impeccable parable, beautifully written from first paragraph to last. -John Updike Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban has the melancholy, bittersweet air of a romance that has come to no significant resolution - Joyce Carol Oates A perfect novel. - Rivka Galchen Some writers make me laugh out loud; Rachel Ingalls makes me cackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For her 1982 masterpiece, the short novel Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban, Ingalls takes a B-movie premise and pounds it into a thrilling new shape. - Ed Park Village Voice What You SayFilter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
