Pullman himself is most certainly an atheist and no fan organized religion in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his books are most scathing towards dogmatism and unquestioned authority, not any one faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are brave (gay) angels in later volumes -- which must have thrown Donohue into conniptions if he got that far --not to mention the death of a God-like figure, and a church that is kidnapping and torturingchildren in an obsessive desire to rub out the "sin" of sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's bold and compelling andultimately very challenging indeed - just like most great literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a practicing Catholic, I foundthem enthralling, fascinating and have shared them with friends, neices and nephews and theirparents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the many people of faith who have found the book's serious grappling with issues of sexuality and belief worthwhile is no less than Rowan Williams, the head of the Anglican Church and that religion's equivalent to the Pope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the head of one of the world's major religions canchampion these books, along with countless other people of faith, literary critics, scholars andmere fans of excellent fantasy fiction, then clearly it cannot be denounced out of hand as evil orinappropriate to read and discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parents are always responsible for deciding what books areappropriate for their children at what age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anyone who would ban or denounce His DarkMaterials and try to keep it and The Wizard of Oz and the Harry Potter books and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Catcher In The Rye and Are You There God, IIt's Me Margaret and countless other classics from everyone else and insist these books are dangerous or evil is justfoolish and ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all comes down to how you practice your faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If, like Donohue, you want people to unthinkingly accept whatever they are told, then anything that encourages thought and debate is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you believe that an unexamined faith is meaningless, if you believe that in fact it is your duty to question your faith and yourself and how to practice that faith in the world today, then no movie,no book, no CD will be anything other than an opportunity to talk, discuss and contemplate what itmeans to be a person of faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Donohue would have none of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An angry, bullying, bigoted figure, he resembles nothing so much as the notorious anti-Semite Father Charles Coughlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Donohue has denounced Hollywood as "controlled by secular Jews" and says "Hollywood likes anal sex." He calls homosexuality the "gay death style," spews venom and hate at anyone who talks about the horrificchild abuse scandals that continue to rock the Church, blaming it mostly on gays and the mediaand deep-pocketed lawyers and even accuses people of lying about being abused to cash in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Checkout the Today show clip where he is so angry and nasty and unhinged compared to the calm, reasoned guests also on the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's remarkable that Donohue is still invited on TV after so many blow-ups on air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But whatever you think about his politics, Donohue simply doesn't comport himself in a Christian manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hebullies, he yells, he mocks, he spews hate - he does everything in fact except behave with Christianhumility and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV producers who keep booking him because he "makes good TV"should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to know more about why Donohue hates The Golden Compass so much, he'll gladly sell you a copy of his 23 page booklet for only $5 each. (If it's so dangerous, why not simply post his pamphlet online for free?) Or you could simply buy the entire "His Dark Materials" trilogy on sale at Amazon for $13.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the United States is not yet a theocracy, happily the choice is stillyours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...
