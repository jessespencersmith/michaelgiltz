                <p>Q&amp;AI------ Scott Pomfret &amp; Scott Whittier The two Scotts-lawyer Pomfret and adver­ tising whiz Whittier-have broken into the book industry big time with the romance novel Hot Sauce (Warner Books, $12.95).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After self-publishing four books and setting up a Web site to promote them, the Boston­ based couple saw their mix of traditional romance and gay elements catch the eye of major imprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they're garnering more press and more readers than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the difference between gay erotica (which you both write on your own) and a gay romance novel? Whittier: It's the focus on the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pomfret: In erotica you have a lot of the allure of the stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a lot ofthe dark alley, and the romance lasts all of 15 seconds before the action starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The college freshman moving into the dorm ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pomfret: You've got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One step into the dorm room, and he's already getting laid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one of our books the first sex scene is on page 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's always in the context of relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd like to think it's at least as hot, but it's much more focused on tenderness and "I know what this guy likes" and loving gestures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which is harder to write? Whittier: 1 love writing the romances because sex isn't the only part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Erotica is like a quickie; you just knock out a quick, hot little story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pomfret: If we've just had sex, both erotica and romance are impossible to write because there's no motivation to get worked up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I think tenderness is a little harder to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got to stay focused on your characters, so one sex scene can't be so different from another that it seems like different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who writes better sex scenes? Whittier: My scenes for the romance novel are sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ones 1 write for erotic anthologies are ... filthy. [Laughs] Pomfret: I've got to say, on the erotic writing, Scott has a dirtier imagination than I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find it totally attractive, personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is monogamy p~rt and parcel ofthe romance genre? Pomfret: Monogamy is what we're shooting for right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't mean there won't be a different type of romance novel in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're not trying to write for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're writing for people who have that dream of a husband, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that is a dream of monogamy. " In our books the sex is perfect, and it goes on for five pages, and you don't break your parents' hot tub, which I've done. " 8 I August 16. 2005 www.advocate.com And of course all your characters are absurdly handsome and successful and sexy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whittier: I will admit, the only negative feedback we've gotten from people is that the heroes are too handsome, too hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sex is always wonderful, and it goes on for five pages, and it's perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you don't break your parents' hot tub, which I've done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the most romantic thing about the other Scott? Whittier: He makes me coffee every morn­ ing. 1 don't get out of bed until 1 hear the grinder going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the most romantic fact about Hot Sauce is that it had to be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your original, self-published version climaxed with a gay civil union in Vermont-but when Warner Books was relaunching it, you had to update it to a same-sex marriage in Massa­ chusetts, where the story is set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pomfret: Honestly, that almost made me weep, to be able to rewrite that scene and to set it in our own state, with history getting ahead of what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was fantas­ tic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An honor, really. -Interview by Michael Giltz THE ADVOCATE</p>
