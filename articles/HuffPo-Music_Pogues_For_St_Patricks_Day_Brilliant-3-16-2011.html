Brilliant Read More: Ireland , Kirsty MacColl , NY Around Town , NY Culture , NY Events , Pogues , Shane MacGowan , Entertainment News THE POGUES ** 1/2 out of **** TERMINAL 5 In the first of what I hope and believe will be many farewell tours, the Pogues are playing in New York City for their annual lead-up to St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patrick's Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also perform March 16 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're older now - and aseveryone is wont to point out, still alive! -- so it's notquite the same as seeing them in their heyday in the 80s.A band that once seemed dangerous is now a belovedinstitution, if not downright huggable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ShaneMacGowan's indecipherable comments between songs are teased by fellow bandmates with friendly jokes.Nothing made this clearer than the fact that the people standing next to me said they'd just heard that MacGowan was still in his hotel room and at least half anhour away... just as the lights dimmed and the show began on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On time! I was almost disappointed,which proves you just can't please some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I last some them some 25 years ago when the band was at their peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My friend Denise drove us to Atlanta (an eight hour car ride) for the show pegged to the Peace &amp; Love album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They roared through their set recklessly and you felt certain the wheels might come off at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now back together andtaking a victory lap, they continue to deliver musically, from the opener "Streams of Whiskey" to "BoatTrain" and "Sunny Side Of The Street" (not that one) and "If I Should Fall From Grace With God" MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful InFOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Personal Finance | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: The Funniest People Not On TwitterMiranda Kerr &amp; Orlando Bloom Step Out To 'The The Funniest Someecards For Easter 2011Weekly Roundup of eBay Vintage Clothing Finds News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 2K Like 20K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCAL The crowd was rowdy at times, especially the ones grouped towards the front on center right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They pushed and shoved with happy abandon and one burly fellow (at least) was ejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank God! This isn'tthe Clancy Brothers in their matching sweaters and you do want a little hint of abandon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MacGowan is the beating heart of the band, of course, so when he was offstage for a breather, the energy level dipped, though an excellent instrumental showed they're a fiercesome group of musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never amaster of elocution (Julie Andrews, he ain't), MacGowan's voice is pure bleat now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be lovely to report that like Chet Baker or Billie Holiday he has exploited his voice's limitations to break your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, it's just a raspy, Waits-ian roar, more of an instrument than a source for lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he knows thatand sings with commitment, even if he totters a bit from one part of the stage to another during andbetween numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through sheer will, the words come clear now and again, as on the old folk classic "Dirty Old Town" (a song about a town in England, by the way, not Ireland).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That song was written by Ewan MacColl, the father of Kirsty MacColl, who of course dueted with the Pogues on that unlikeliest of holiday classics, "Fairytale of New York." If I needed any further proof they'd be back in town some day, it was the simple fact that they didn't sing this gem, my favorite of theirs and a tune that often jumps back onto the Top 10in the UK every December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That didn't stop the fans, however: two semi-drunk fellows started belting itout on their own after the lights were up and people were streaming out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So tell me, what music will you be spinning for St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patrick's Day? I start with Bing Crosby because that's how my mother raised me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You?
