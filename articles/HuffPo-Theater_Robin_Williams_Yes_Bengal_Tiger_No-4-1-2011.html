Bengal Tiger , No BENGAL TIGER AT THE BAGHDAD ZOO ** out of **** RICHARD RODGERS THEATRE Clearly, playwright Rajiv Jospeh is a talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this season, his show Gruesome Playground Injuries played Off Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While not emotionally involving, it wascleverly constructed and inspired top work fromeveryone involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His new drama Bengal Tiger At TheBaghdad Zoo was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize after world premiering in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now it's openingon Broadway with Robin Williams as the tiger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's still finding his way as an artist; his plays feel technically proficient but not burning with desire to tell this particular story or reveal that particular character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph's main driving force at the moment seems to be the understandable desire simply to be a playwright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not that Joseph is showing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, hisflashier conceits are often the most effective, most theatrical parts of his shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's yet to find therich emotional vein that will allow him to combine his obvious skill with insight and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bengal Tiger begins with a bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams is a tiger being guarded by two soldiers after the invasion of Iraq -- Tom (Glenn Davis) and not-so-bright Kev (Brad Fleischer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tiger mocks the soldiers and talks to the audience but the soldiers only hear its growls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom thinks it's hungry and foolishly offers a piece offood, only to have the tiger snap off his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kev kills the tiger, but that doesn't stop Williams from MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful InFOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Personal Finance | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Soon, the stage is crowded with ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tiger is haunted by a little girl who had half her face blown off and keeps crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kev is haunted by the tiger and then starts to haunt Tom himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom somehowgets reassigned to duty even though he's missing one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom's interpreter is really a gardener, an artist, who always makes the mistake of working for the tyrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First the interpreter Musa (a fine Arian Moayed) was a gardener for Uday Hussein, ignoring the brutal way the Husseins held power in exchange for the chance to sculpt beautiful topiary hedges in the shapesof animals, like an elephant and a giraffe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musa's little Eden of a garden is destroyed when he brings hislittle sister to see the garden and she's raped and killed by Uday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uday was killed by the Americans buthaunts Musa and urges him on to violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Musa works for the Americans, who loot his country of trinkets and force him to interpret requests for sex between soldiers and young prostitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone is troubled and unhappy and soon most everyone is addressing God, quite loudly and vociferously, if not exactly in an original manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're certainly not the first people to ask God how hecould allow a world in which sad and terrible things happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second act in particular is filled withexistential mutterings and rather heavy-handed symbolism, like a gold toilet seat that one personclutches to himself in the middle of the desert, even as he's slowly dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here and elsewhere, BengalTiger at the Baghdad Zoo echoes everything from Waiting For Godot to Camus to the excellent film Three Kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast does its best under the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fleischer has some fun when his dim-witted soldier is suddenly imbued with knowledge and insight (not a great thing, apparently) after dying, getting some laughs out of his desire to imagine a friendship between himself and Tom on one hand and dashing offArabic and philosophical nuggets on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their best scenes come early -- the opener and a laterscene in a hospital where Tom just wants his gold-plated pistol back and Kev is hurt to realize Tom wasn'treally coming to see how the mentally unraveling Kev is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a rare moment where characters aresimply allowed to react to one another with normal desires and frustrations, rather than voice vague,existential doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams is solid as the tiger, a tricky role that forces him to hold the stage alone and rarely get to play off another actor the way he did in the acclaimed revival of Waiting For Godot .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's restrained work, by and large, with any stand-up energy (notably at the beginning of the second act) injected merely to support the play, not hijack it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike the stellar work done on Gruesome , this show is not helped by the production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The direction of Moises Kaufman feels leaden, with long pauses between lines and the entrances and exits handled in a prosaic manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set by Derek McLane feels heavy and unimaginative, with a raised platform juttingout awkwardly on one side to no good effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few hints at the beauty of Arabic art and architecture aregood (like the tiled floor and some nice screens) but when we're meant to be in a desert with a blastedlandscape, it's just a dark flat world with a modest crag or two in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems to be nowhere and not a symbolic NOWHERE either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's good to see a new artist exploring and striving and pushing boundaries and encouraged at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
