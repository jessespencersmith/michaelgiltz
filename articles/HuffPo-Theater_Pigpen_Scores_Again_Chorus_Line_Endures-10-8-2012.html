Yes, I have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They formed at Carnegie Mellon (where I assume they all got As from their theater teachers) and developed an approach to creating and telling original stories steeped in folk tales, puppetry and theirwonderful original songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've seen Peter and the Starcatcher, you'll be familiar with the playful fun they have with theatrical convention, the narrator, and the love of imagination that fires their story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aflashlight and a darkened theater creates more atmosphere than anything you'll see at Spiderman: TurnMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Was The Whole Donald Trump Announcement A Gigantic, Pointless Bust?

But what about the moon, he frets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hasa point since they don't know what might happen if they abandon their post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But to be honest he's quitehappy with the routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's not and one day goes off in a small boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The old man follows her (howcould he not?) and there hangs a tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's an animated short that echoes the design work and puppetry in the show; it's for the song "Bremen," one of the instantly memorable tunes written for this piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw their second show and then their first one and now their third so I may be a little confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Ithink I see a progression in their work, which has always reveled in Monty Python-esque wordplay andsilliness along with simple but effective theatrical touches, like using a piece of brown cloth to represent aroiling sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pigpen has a very distinct style but they're also deepening their stories, reaching for more than just silliness and laughs (which are always present) and achieving a genuine depth of emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Old Man And The Old Moon is a rollicking tale but it's less episodic than others, with a stronger through-line that shows the group isn't simply repeating old tricks, no matter how fun they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More of the songs are presented as solo spots and I admit I missed more of the group singing that is so lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you get to hear them in spades on the album Bremen , which echoes those other current acts and of course classic groups like Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Randy Newman and The Band (minus the mythicovertones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all they embrace death and life, sadness and joy, love and loneliness, fear and triumphand more because like the best folk and blues artists they know you can't have one without the other.From the lovely opener "As Lonely As Me" to "The Graveyard Song" and "Just Like The Sea," this albumshould win them a whole new audience that has never seen their shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, if you can catch The OldMan And The Old Moon , by all means do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then you can ask your friends, "Have you heard of Pigpen?" before they ask you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pregnancy From Rape Is 'Something God Intended' Coulter Uses Slur Against Obama Another Day In Polls, Still Neck-And-Neck WATCH: Vivica A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Posts Shirtless Photo Liam Neeson Pokes Fun at Bieber Teen Mom's New 16,000Dollar Face NOTE: As a band, PigPen is performing four shows at Joe's Pub starting Monday October 15, two shows in November and a final show on December 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A CHORUS LINE *** PAPERMILL PLAYHOUSE It's one of the biggest hits in Broadway history but my sum total experience with the landmark musical A Chorus Line is one community theater production in Gainesville, Florida (my college town) and the godawful film version directed by the tone deaf Richard Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's immediately clear even to a neophyte like me is how prescient, influential and perfectly structured the show remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combine that with by far the best work of the late Marvin Hamlisch and you've got a musical that is almostindestructible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps to have a strong ensemble and oversight by Mitzi Hamilton, the inspiration for Val and the director here in this faithful restaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This crowd-pleasing production at Papermill Playhouse certainly has that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An opening night tribute to Hamlisch featuring dozens of people linked to the show (including original cast members Priscilla Lopez, Scott Allen and Kelly Bishop of Gilmore Girls ) was the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're so used to seeing people pour their hearts out on national television just for the chance to audition and get on TV that Chorus no longer has the shock of the new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefuls are voted off the island or rejected by judges or dissed by Simon Cowell so often that it's no longer a gasp-inducing shock to seepeople open a vein in their emotions and then be sent packing by a director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nail-biting high drama is now a more relaxed human drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the intimacy of the show and the daring simplicity of the staging -- which meant that at the finale you could bring in a few mirrors and some sequins and it would seem like fireworks -- that's still as fresh as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A string of dancers are auditioning for a chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The director rather unusually asks them to talk about themselves and we slowly get drawn in by their tales of insecurity, bullying as kids,love of dance, fears, hopes and desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes seeing them cut from the show or sidelined by aninjury painfully emotional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's it, really, but it's so brilliantly constructed and staged and lit that theimpact can be tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the songs are among the best character-driven tunes imaginable. "What I Did For Love" and "One" are the standards of course, but "I Hope I Get It," "At The Ballet," "Dance: Ten, Looks: Three" arepoignant and funny and revealing in ways most show tunes can only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could go on and onabout the brilliance of Michael Bennett's show, such as how "One" is developed almost in front of oureyes, evolving from a rehearsal where the actors speak out loud their movements and steps to the pianointro that links several scenes (and preps us for the finale) to its full-blown incarnation that raises theroof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But let's discuss this particular production, which delivers a solid accounting of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The men shine more than the women, but with 26 people on stage, this is a genuine ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the greataccomplishments of the book by James Kirkwood &amp; Nicholas Dante is to give so many characters achance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amanda Rose and Mike Cannon (in full Bowery Boy mode) have fun thanks to theirgood rapport on the clever "Sing!" Ashley Arcement delivers the once shocking ode to plastic surgery"Dance: Ten, Looks: Three," proving that a great tune can overcome its subject matter turning passe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps to give a modern spin on the monologues without sacrificing when they were created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show has three explicitly gay characters, which is probably about two more than you would expect in aHOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Katy Perry Video Barack Obama Business Arrested Development San Francisco Giants Abortion John McCain Todd Akin Buy a link here Sponsored Links Why VW Stories Watch Volkswagen stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s not the miles, it’s how you live them. www.whyvw.com Man Cheats Credit Score 1 simple trick &amp; my credit score jumped 217pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks hate this! thecreditsolutionprogram.com Edmunds™ – Official Site Begin Your Car Search With Edmunds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research,Reviews, Prices and More www.Edmunds.com MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » WATCH: Vivica A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox SLAMS Stacey Dash's Romney Endorsement Adele's 'Skyfall' Made Daniel Craig Cry Snoop Dogg Explains Why He's Voting For Obama Lindsay Lohan's Incredible Debate Tweets mainstream Broadway musical in 1975, even one about chorus boys and girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I first heard Paul's monologue in the 1980s, it felt dated in its seeming acceptance of self-loathing by gays in a strip club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manuel Santos gives a delicate spin to an early line about learning how to be a man which puts a fresh insight into the piece that restores Paul's dignity and lets the warmth of his story shine through rather than his breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gabrielle Ruiz like most here doesn't have a powerhouse voice but acts her way through her big numbers as Diana with appealing vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Harvey is solid as the director Zach (and does a nice job ofdancing in character).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in a show loaded with exceptionally fit and appealing people, Brian Lettendrebrings sexiness and personality to the small role of Larry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the characters of Cassie and Sheila loom large, even in this ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, Jessica Lee Goldyn falls far short as the magnetic Cassie, an almost-star and former flame of the director nowreduced to trying out for a spot in the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldyn's performance is overwrought, bringing a soapyelement to her confrontation with Zach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's certainly a better dancer, but I was already cut off from Cassie emotionally when she began that show-stopping number "The Music and The Mirror." I found even her dancing relatively mechanical but my guest felt her dancing was solid and rescued the moment somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rachelle Rak fares much better as the seen-it-all Sheila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She could tone down the brassiness just a tad; she's having so much fun delivering her one-liners that we don't always get to relish them as much asRak does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Sheila is always putting on a performance so it's not too out of character and Rak's delightover the part she famously lost out on for the Broadway revival is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As is the show as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A long run can take the energy out of any show so I'm glad I didn't see it ten or twelve years into its original Broadway run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And familiarity can breed indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do we really need tosee it again, some might ask? But as long as people get on a bus and come to New York (or London orChicago or anywhere) to pursue their dreams, A Chorus Line will retain its power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
