I much prefer boxedsets that stay roughly within the dimensions of other DVDs or CDs so the boxed set -- even if it's a lot thicker -- can fit on a shelf alongside all the others in my collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless you have a big coffee table and want to give a boxed set pride of place in your home, they just don't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, this deluxe boxed set won't even fit on most of my bookcase shelves! But when it arrived in the mail, I have to admit I broke into a grin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the size of a boxed set is going to reflect the importance of the work contained within, Graceland could be two or three times its current size as far as its impact on music and importance in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hard shell is beautifully designed andcontains the full complement of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a full-sized booklet with photos and liner notes and lyrics.You also get a fold-out display that contains a reproduction of the legal pad Simon originally wrote lyricsin as well as all four discs: the album, an extra CD with demo tracks and a 10 minute discussion of thealbum by Simon, the DVD of the documentary film Under African Skies and the first DVD release of Graceland: The African Concert which was recorded in Zimbabwe in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm also a curmudgeon about exclusive bonus material (fans shouldn't have to remember to buy album A at Best Buy and album B at WalMart to get extra stuff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I will mention that if you buy the set on Amazon you also get a third CD with five live tracks from the Graceland tour recorded in Spain in 1989. (The one thing missing for me? I've always wanted to hear the mixtape or album that obsessed Simon and led to Graceland .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even after seeing the documentary it's unclear to me whether this was an album by the Boyoyo Boys, a mix tape made by an individual, or an "official" compilation featuring them and otheracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any case, rights issues probably made it impractical, if anyone even considered it.) The boxed set is beautifully designed on the outside and looks impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to make a statement, this does the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The album, of course, sounds better than ever, with new, subtle detailsemerging from the remastering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The demos are interesting for completists but most people won't listen tothem more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of the packaging has some downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CDs and DVDs are held inawkward little "holes" (they're not quite slots) and are a little tricky to get in and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Foxbooklet of photos and liner notes is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains a nice intro by Jesse Kornbluth and lyrics big enough to read (a nice change of pace from CD booklets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the bulk of the book contains an oralhistory of Graceland and I'd say 70 percent of it repeats statements heard in the documentary film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume the rest of the quotes are pulled from the interviews that didn't make the final cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So once you've seen the film, the bulk of the booklet feels repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Graceland: The African Concert is long overdue on DVD but it's more of a document than a satisfying film on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The concert presented runs 90 minutes and contains the exact same set Simon and the artists performed at Madison Square Garden on the tour, minus the encores of some Simon &amp; Garfunkel tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a perfectly acceptable souvenir but by no means a great concert film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume at some point it will be available on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real attraction, of course, is Under African Skies , the documentary film by Joe Berlinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a talented director with little visual flair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berlinger finds fascinating topics and explores them in a messy, disorganized way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The journey is worth taking on his films, but it's not a disciplined one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berlinger shineshere in letting Simon tell the full story of making the album and knowingly breaking the cultural boycotton South Africa called for by the African National Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His critics at the time are graciously given their full due and eventually the entire back-and-forth becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mixed in with this political tempest are shots of Simon reuniting with many of the people who played on the album and rehearsing songs with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Berlinger's visual limits are most evident -- musicians jam for a while before we even get a sense of the space they're in and how they're positioned next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as Simon himself has pointed out, these are early rehearsals and the shows themselves will be much tighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, Under African Skies gets the job done and is far and away the most interesting extra available timed to the 25th anniversary of the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not a classic the way the making-of about Bridge Over Troubled Waters has proven to be in a deluxe set released just last year to celebrate its 40th anniversary (!) but it's something Simon fans will certainly enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So that's the boxed set: beautiful but oversized, awkward for holding the actual discs (like a surprising number of boxed sets, frankly) with a very good making-of documentary, a decent concert, and the usualbonus material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has many pluses and minuses but the money is on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For most fans, I think theCD/DVD set is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get the new documentary DVD and the bonus tracks of demos andSimon discussing the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's slightly larger than a standard CD (6 by 5.5 inches) but most shelvesshould just about accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The LP, of course, is for the audiophiles who can't give up theirturntables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I envy them getting to sit down and listen to the album while looking at that iconic cover.Maybe that's why my eyes lit up on seeing the boxed set: those of us used to CDs or even digital-onlyalbums rarely get the chance to see graphics life-sized and in living color anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tomorrow: Graceland: Its Cultural Impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until then, enjoy the official video for "The Boy In The Bubble," the great opening track on the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

" Graceland The African Concert" has long been available on DVD though {Warner ].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have had a copy for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Simon fans have long wanted the Concert in the Park 1991issued as a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agree about the discs being awkward to extract 12:52 AM on 06/09/2012 Hi Brenda,Thanks for commenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps The African Concert has been available overseas? TheWB press release says this is the first DVD release of the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And looking online before I posted the review, I saw just a few DVDs costing hundreds of dollars at resellers and the VHS also wildly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was your version a US release DVD? Press releases havebeen known to be wrong before, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was at the Concert In the park in 1991, whichwas great fun though my favorite Paul Simon show was at the Beacon a little while afterthat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope you keep reading the series on Graceland and keep commenting. 02:29 AM on 06/09/2012 Hi Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you for replying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did purchase my dvd in Australia at JB Hi Fi.Cost $21.99 in 2009. released by Warner Bros in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was alsoreleased in the USA too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to this Amazon link on March 23 1999. under product details it states Region 1 {USA and Canada} and the format is NTSC I know it is very rare now ,hence the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess the press release was wrong.Lucky you to have been at the Concert In The Park! http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Simon-Graceland-African-Concert/dp/6305342784 Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQPermalink | Share it Soulsurfer Solar Electrician,Longtime Surfin'Fool Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER izekman Permalink | Share it Brenda Pugh Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it Brenda Pugh Permalink | Share it107 Fans 858 Fans 190 Fans 5 Fans 132 Fans 5 Fans User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright © 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost Entertainment</p>
