More than 30 years after his last box office hit ( My Cousin Vinny, if you’re wondering), the likable Macchio is starring in a new hit film.S u b s c ribe T yp e y our e m ai l . . .5/17/25, 3:28 PM The "Karate Kid" Is Back! - Michael Giltz https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/the-karate-kid-is-ba ck 3/13Karate Kid: Legends (co-starring Jackie Chan) opened in Latin America this week, grossing some $6 million and hitting #11 on my weekly worldwide box office chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It opens in North America and most of the world by May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s why you should never read too much into where a movie lands on the chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A movie can open at #1 and flop. (Too expensive, collapsing in week two, etc.) It can open in one country an just roll along for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or it can slow roll across the world over weeks and never #1 but still be a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Movies aren’t in competition with each other, not usua lly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A that matters is how much they cost to make and how much they gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I don’t know why Spanish should be such an impediment but I don’t see any critics weigh i in on Rotten Tomatoes for this movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, surely it’s been reviewed! I’ve no idea what the buzz may be, though thanks to the earlier films and the acclaimed tv se rie the goodwill for this one is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually at #1 this week is Thunderbolts* (which is now semi-officially called The New Avengers but that’s confusing so I’m keeping it as Thunderbolts*).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Marvel movie enjoyed better reviews than the last few Marvel films and held a little bett er.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it’s only got two more weeks before summer really arrives with Mission: Impossible’ s late and the live action Lilo &amp; Stitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, the new Final Destination will be on top next week but Thunderbolts* will be fine against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I need another week before feelin confident it will get to $500m+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, those odds go up because Disney is committed to theatrical and will let this one play and play through all of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As is typical, most of the big Hollywood movies on the chart are making more mon e internationally than in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thunderbolts*, A Minecraft Movie, Snow White The Amateur, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and even the low budget Until Dawn all follow that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two current exceptions? Ben Affleck’s The Accountant 2 and Michael B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan’s Sinners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’m not quite sure why it’s true with Affleck. ( The Accountant also made mor money in North America than the rest of the world.) And it’s pretty common in rece5/17/25, 3:28 PM The "Karate Kid" Is Back! - Michael Giltz https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/the-karate-kid-is-ba ck 4/13years for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can find many times–especially on big budget movies–which aren’t always his jam–where Affleck draws them in worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan is a more complicated case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, most of his movies made more North America than overseas and you can definitely chalk that up to prejud ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can also chalk that up to Hollywood’s century-long assumption that movies wit Black stars won’t travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don’t make them as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don’t market t hem as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so the films–and the stars of those films–don’t draw as much attention when their films do get screened in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chicken and egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But look a little closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, all three Creed films and Black Panther made more in No America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not that much more. (I’m ignoring the 2015 misfire Fantastic Four, whi made more overseas; that was before Creed made Jordan a bankable star.) Black Pant made $700m in North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also grossed a massive $635m in the rest of th world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His breakout role in Creed? It hit $110m in North America and “just” $65m internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Creed II hit $115m in North America and a nearly identical $98m elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creed III made $156m in NA and $120m internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Sinners is an outlier for Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s grossing three times as much in North Americ it is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now, it’s at $215m in North America and $70m internationally But that doesn’t change the fact that each Creed film grew internationally and Black Panther was a worldwide smash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan is a global star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His movies have grossed more than $1.2b internationally, so far. (And $1.6b in North America.) And Sinners ain’t quite done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s returning to some IMAX screens this weekend and will open in South Korea and Hong Kong soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, we’ve got another horror flick hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clown in a Cornfield cost less than $1mb t make and grossed $4m worldwide on its opening week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s the biggest opening wee yet for IFC, which is old school when it comes to vertical integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They make movies, show them in their theaters, play them on their cable channel, stre am them their streamer and generally squeeze out every penny they can at every sta ge.5/17/25, 3:28 PM The "Karate Kid" Is Back! - Michael Giltz https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/the-karate-kid-is-ba ck 5/13Opening this week: The latest entry in the Final Destination comic horror franchise proof there will be no final Final Destination until audiences stop showing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailer is funny and macabre–as expected–and moviegoers are primed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If 2025 i s the year of peak horror, fan fatigue hasn’t appeared yet and won’t with this flick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I t’s the sixth in the series, with the first five grossing an evil $666 million worldwide to d ate (True!)

I take the tot worldwide box office we have for a movie, subtract from it the previous week's tota worldwide box office...and that's how much it made during the past seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QE Naturally, some territories and movies fall through the cracks, but I am as u p to dat I can be, given my dependence on other outlets for the basic info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, I ke ep an ongoing list of box office week by week for 2025 here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It includes more complete charts, info on hits from smaller territories (grosses for many countries la g behind b week) and updated box office info when more accurate numbers become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which movies make the list for The Hit Films of 2025? My rule of thumb is that movies should gross roughly three times as much as their reported budget (or acquisition price) to be called a hit from theatrical alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people now say a mo need only make 2 1/2 times as much as their budget, but I'm sticking with the traditional formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, we don't really know a movie's budget or the cost of advertising or any backroom deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, just because a movie isn't a hit fr om theatrical alone doesn't mean it’s losing money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many movies are profitable despite not being a hit from theatrical alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, we can't dive de ep into Hollywood accounting here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we can spot the really big hits that will change careers, launch franchises and generally pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's harder to ge t a reported budget on international films so I tend to avoid calling them a hit unless I have som info that convinces me they're a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, I include movies from a previous year they make the majority of their money in this calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I iden tify the country for non-Hollywood movies to celebrate the worldwide movie biz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I indicate the language Indian films were made in to celebrate that country's diverse industry,5/17/25, 3:28 PM The "Karate Kid" Is Back! - Michael Giltz https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/the-karate-kid-is-ba ck 11/13which is vibrant and includes more than the Hindi-language Bollywood film s Westerners knew best. – Michael Giltz mgiltz@pipeline.com www.michaelgiltz.com www.popsurfing.com --30-- S u b s c ribe t o M ichae l G iltz D ile tt a nt e , pr o g re ss iv e , pr o f e ss ion a l a m a te ur B y su b s c ribi n g , I ag ree to S u b st ack 's T e rms o f U s e , a n d ack nowl edge its In form a tion C oll ec tion N ot ice a n d P riv ac y P ol ic y .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; D is c us s ion ab out thi s postS u b s c ribe T yp e y our e m ai l . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; W rite a c omm e nt . . .C omm e nts R e st ack s5/17/25, 3:28 PM The "Karate Kid" Is Back! - Michael Giltz https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/the-karate-kid-is-ba ck 12/13© 2025 M ichae l G iltz ∙ P riv ac y ∙ T e rms ∙ C oll ec tion not ice S u b st ack i s the h om e for g rea t c ultur e5/17/25, 3:28 PM The "Karate Kid" Is Back! - Michael Giltz https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/the-karate-kid-is-ba ck 13/13</p>
