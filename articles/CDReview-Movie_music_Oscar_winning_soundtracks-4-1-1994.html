Anthony Advene-and put each under With that in mind, we decided to put close scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are Oscar's ears really Oscar-and his choices for Best Original golden? Or simply lead? ALADDIN (1992 ) Motion Pictu1'C SOlmdt1'flck WALT DISNEY 60B46-1 Performance * * * Sound Quality * * * * Awitty romp with Robin WiLliams proving a capable comic singer and Brad Kane an especially appealing hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Menken's score, however, is merely competent during the action scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And points must be taken off for the now­ obligatory pop single tacked on at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Collec­ tors should search out early pressings for the origi­ nal "Arabian Nights" opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its line describing a land "Where they cut off your earlIf they don't like your face" has since been altered in deference to Arab American sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEAUTY AND THE BEAST(1991) Motion PiCtli1-e Soundt1'fl ck IVALT DISNEY 6061B-1 Performance * * * * Sound Quality * * * * Apinnacle in the collaboration between com­ poser Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ash­ man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with the showstoppers ("Be Our Guest" and "Gaston"), Beauty and the Beast features "Belle," a yearning number about the need to break free; "Something There," a sweet tune about the stirrings of love; and a handful of other equally good num­ bers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Menken's darkly romantic writing for strings during the climax is especially memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DANCES WITH WOLVES (1990) Motion Picture Soltndt1-ack EPIC ASSOCIATED ZK 469B1 Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * * Amournful, hushed masterpiece from John Barry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even during a percussion-heavy battle scene like "Pawnee Attack," the music somehow maintains an air of resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the sound of a people fading away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Achingly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989 ) Motion Pictzt1'e Sozmdt1'flck WALT DISNEY CD-OIB Performance * * Sound Quality * * * Not nearly as good as you might remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite a few songs are perfunctory, and Ariel's signature tune, "Part of Your World," is just a rough draft for "Belle" in Beauty and the Beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The highlights belong to Sebastian the Crab, who high­ kicks it through "Under the Sea" and the infectious, reggae-tin ged "Kiss the Girl." The instrumenta l passages simply mimic the on-screen action rather than commenting or expanding on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Menken quickly proved himself capable of much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILAGRO BEANF IELD WAR (1988) Dave Gntsin: Mig1-ation GRP GRD-9591 Performance * * * Sound Quality * * * * ~ Polite jazz tunes ably performed by Dave ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grusin with an assist from Branford 'g Marsalis, Omar Hakin1, and others. (Hugh : Masekela lights up the two tracks he solos on.) The ~ lO-minute suite ftom The Mita[!}-o Beanfield War ~ ventures south of the border for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's " quite charming . "Pistolero," with its charging : ~ rhythms and formal air, manages to capture the .~ whimsical but deadly serious nature of the story • better than the movie itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LAST EMPEROR (1987) I Motion Pictll1'e Soundtrack VIRGIN 86029-1 ;: t Performance * * * Sound Quality * * * * " An unusual mix here, with Ryuichi Sakamoto contributing to nine tracks, David Byrne to ~ five, Cong Su to one, and a handful of misceJJa- ~ neous pieces by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakamoto's work is typical- ~ @AMPAS CD REVIEW APRIL 1994 Iy florid in its engaging way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Byrne's music, including "Main Title Theme," is exceptional: Spare, elegant, and inventively orchestrated, it makes you long to hear more from him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music is grouped by composer rather than chronological­ ly and suffers for it. 'ROUND .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIDNIGHT (1986) Motion Picture Soundtrack COLUMBIA CK 40464 Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * The performances in this marvelous homage to jazz were recorded live, giving the movie and its soundtrack a charged, exciting feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Herbie Hancock shepherded an all-star lineup including Bobby McFerrin, Ron Carter, and Dexter Gordon through standards like "Body and Soul" and a few sterling originals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The highlights are endless, but one might single out the title track and Chet Baker's sublime vocals on "Fair Weather." OUT OF AFRICA (1985) Music from tbe Motion Pictlwe MCA MCAD·6158 Performance * * Sound Qualit y * * * Aquiet, nondescript score from John Barry that worked well enough in the movie yet has no strong identity of its own. "Have You Got a Story for Me?" contains a particularly banal solo for piano, and "Flying Over Africa" and even "Main Title (I Had a Farm in Africa)" fade quickly from memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mozart, however, rose to the occa­ sion by providing a fine Conce-rto in A jin-Clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A PASSAGE TO INDIA (1984) Lean by Jane-Maurice Jane's Musical Tribute to David Lean MILAN 74321 101ll·2 Perform ance * * Sound Quality * * * * Arecordin g of four suites from Maurice Jane's scores for director David Lean, as well as an overture and a minor tune Jarre wrote for Lean's wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acting as conductor, Jarre tends to emphasize the bombastic aspects of his music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suite from A Passage to India is a rather droll sendup of tourists out to have an "adventure ." But the cue from the incident in the caves is shorn of its power, and, overall, the music from Ryan's Daugbte-r, DOct01-Zbivago, and the rest tend to can­ cel one another out in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE RIGHT STUFF (1983) Tbe Rigbt StufflNol -tb and Soutb -Original Scores VARESE SARABANDE VCD 472;0 Performance * * * * Sound Quality * * * * Noone ever accused composer Bill Conti of shying away from a grandiose statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tbe Right Stuffhis natural inclinations met the perfect material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is sweeping, heart­ pounding music that charges along with gleeful abandon, so cocky and sure of itself you can't help but grin. "Breaking the Sound Barrier" (which nearly does) and "Yeager's Triumph" are especially noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps because the material was less interesting, N011:h and SOllth is less inspired, though certainly not meeker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; E.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE EXTRA­ TERRESTRIAL (1982) Music from the Motion Picture MCA MCAD·lI07J Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * Steven Spielberg used special effects to make E.T. walk and talk, but he needed John Williams' soaring music to make the crea­ ture come alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like every other element of Spielberg's fable, the score is touched by a sense of wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the sweet lyricism of "E.T. and Me" to the sweeping resolution of the 15 minute final track "Adventure on Earth," this is grand stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981) Vangelis-Chm'iots of Fire POLYDOR 800 020·2 Performance * * * * Sound Quality * * * * Synthesizer fiend Vangelis seemed a strange choice to score a period piece about two very different runners at the 1924 Olympics .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his distinctive, modern music quietly emphasized the universal nature of their struggles with the need to compete and win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, of course, the track lifted from the title sequence proved a massive worldwide hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 20-minute closer "Chariots of Fire" meanders a bit, but the rest is top-notch, with "Abraham's Theme" especially noteworthy for capturing the desperate, lonely excitement of a runner during a race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following year, Vangelis would reach perfection with his brilliant work on Blade Runner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FAME (1980) Soundu'ack from the Motion Pict!t1·e POLYDOR 800 Ol4·2 Performance * * Sound Quality * * I rene Cara has the best moments here. "Fame" sounds a little goofy now ("Remember! Remem­ ber! Remember! Remember!" chant the back­ ground singers), but it's still fun, and "Out Here on My Own" is so much better than the rest that it seems to come from a different world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other tracks-such as "Hot Lunch Jam," "Dogs in the Yard," and the truly awful finale "I Sing the Body Electric"-sound exactly like the sort of thing high school students with nascent talent would toss off in an afternoon .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Appropriate, perhaps, but not very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CD REVIEW APRll1994 GEORGES DELERUE A L ITT L E ROM A NeE (1 9 7 9 ) Motion Picture Soundtrack VARESE ARABAN DE VSD-5367 Performance * * * * Sound Quality * * * * The great Georges Delerue seems caught up in the blush of first love in this breezy score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drawing upon Vivaldi for several themes, he strikes just the right tone of benevolence and breathless excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The solo piano in "The Birthday Party" and the lovely waltz of "Julius Edmond Santorin" are especially memorable, but it's all a delight, as is the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIDNIGHT EXPRESS (1978) Music fi·om the Motion Picture CASABLA CA 824 206-2 Performance * Sound Quality * * Vangelis he ain't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giorgio Moroder has a decent riff or two buried in "Chase" and some nicely atmospheric touches in "Cacaphoney." But this is plodding stuff, the sort of electronic noodling that gives synthesizers a bad name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two songs -"Theme from Midnight Express" with Chris Bennett and "Istanbul Blues" with David Castle-are just painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STAR WARS (1977) Stmo Wan Tloilogy­ Original Soundtrack Anthology 20TH CE TURY FOX 07822- 11012-2 Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * * Everything one could hope for in a boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sound quality is uniformly excellent, the scores for the individual movies are more com­ plete than ever, the CDs are properly sequenced with miscellaneous cues appearing on a fourth disc, and the booklet is lavishly detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music, of course, is a landmark achievem~ nt; John Williams almost singlehandedly reawakened public interest in traditional movie music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Lucas once said he knew Stal· Wan would succeed when Darth Vader first appeared and audiences began to boo, rather than laugh as he feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The truth is that he should have known as soon as Williams turned in his score: 0 one could write a theme as grand and stirring as the "Main Title" unless the movie that followed would deliver in spades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE OMEN (1976) Motion Picture Soundtrack VARESE SARABANDE VSD-5281 Performance * * Sound Qualit y * * * Astory about parents whose adopted son turns out to be the anti-Christ hardly calls for restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even by horror standards, this Jerry Goldsmith score is a bit overwrought with strings flailing about and ominous choral arrangements at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Effective, in a sledgehammer sort of way-even quiet-seeming tracks are guaranteed to explode into mayhem or at least contain some whispering voices to keep the audience from relax­ ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A good example of Oscar honoring a talented composer at the wrong time: .JAWS (1975) Motion Pictw·e Soundtm ck MCA MCAD-1660 Performance * * * Sound Quality * * * Its gripping "Main Title" theme has rightly entered the popular consciousness and kept more than a few people out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are some lighter moments such as "Promenade (Tourists on the Menu)" and heroic passages like "Preparing the Cage." But John Williams is much more forceful and convincing when the hunt is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether that hunt involves the Great White tracking down humans or humans tracking down the Great White seems not to matter: He's gleeful either way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GODFATHER PART II (1974) Motion Picture Soundtmck MCA MCAD-lon2 Performance * * * Sound Quality * * * Fellini favorite Nino Rota graced Francis Ford Coppola 's sequel with more powerful but lonely music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rota's old world tunes are weighted down by a deep melancholia, even during domestic scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's brilliant and memorable, just like his work on The Godfather .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the CD contains only about 20 minutes of his work-the rest is incidental music by Cannine Coppola and some Italian songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely more could be gleaned from a movie more than three hours long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE WAY WE WERE (1973) Original Soundtl-ack COLUMBIA CK 57381 Performance * Sound Quality * * * * B arbra Streisand is luminous on the title track, but that song is available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest is nondescript big band takes on standards like "In the Mood" and syrupy Marvin Hamlisch variations on the central theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Streisand reap­ pears briefly when "The Way We Were" is reprised in the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hardly worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIMELIGHT (1972) Charlie/-Music from the Classic Films of Chadie Chaplin SILVA AMERICA SSD 1021 Performance * * * * Sound Quality * * * * Complete scores are always preferable to com­ pilations such as this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But so little of Chaplin's music is available on CD and this is so well done that it seems churlish to quibble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a suite from Modern Times, several tracks from Monsiem- VeI-dozlX and A King in New Y01-k, and individual cuts from other films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limelight is represented by "Eternally," a brashly sentimental tune of the sort that Chaplin had a gift for. (This CD doesn't reproduce the scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The works are newly orchestrated treatments and sometimes drift far afield from the source.) LOVE STORY (1970) Motion PiCtzi1"e Soundtrack MCA MCAD-nOI7 Performance * Sound Quality * * * Composer Francis Lai struck gold-and apparendy exhausted his musical imagina­ tion-wid1 "Theme From Love Story," an over­ ripe number repeated endlessly on piano, harpsi­ chord, and strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are two very bad tracks in which a singer wordlessly vocalizes over strum­ ming guitars, with "Snow Frolic" edging out "I Love You, Phil" for the silliness award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And "Skat­ ing in Central Park" sounds wmerving ly nonde­ script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you seem to recall a piece or two that wasn't nearly that bad, it's probably the Mozart or Bach thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969) Music from the Film A&amp;MCDJI59 Performance * * Sound Qualit y * * * * This Burt Bacharach CD comes in at under 30 minutes and sounds appropriate ly thin. "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" is pleasant, and other tracks such as "The Sundance Kid" do have a mild tunefulness, but that's the total of nice things to say about the disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE (1967) Original Soundtrack MCA MCAD-10662 Performance * Sound Qualit y * * Thoroughly mediocre, actually, and as worthless as a musical with Julie Andrews and Carol CD REVIEW APRIL 1994 • Julie Andrews Dick Van Dyke I!t. __ ... =_::'_~ .......... ", __ C_ ...... m"-Channing can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; T~ new numbers written for the film-the tide track and "The Tapioca"-are with­ out interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And everyone sounds a bit disttacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (1965) Original MGM Soundtrack CBS SPECIAL PROD UCTS AK 45437 Performance * * Sound Qualit y * * Far from the best work of David Lean or Mau­ rice Jarre, naturally Doctor Zhivago became one of their biggest hits. "Lara's Theme" is repeated over and over to no great effect and the gloomy male chorus in "Revolution" and elsewhere sounds muddy and unconvincing .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the use of ethnic instruments sounds merely like an accent, rather than an organic part of the score as it does on Jarre's Lawrence of Arabia and The Man Who Would Be King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARY POPPINS (1964) Motion Picture Soundtrack WALT DIS EY 60842-2 Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * ASpoonfui of Sugar," "Chim Chim Cher-ee," and "Su percalifragilisti cexpia lidocious." They're all well-known and Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke perform them with a witty self­ awareness .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is sur­ prising is the high quality of the other tunes. "Sis­ ter Suffragette " and "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank" are clever little gems, with "The Perfect Nanny" not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie may be dated, but the songs, virtually all of them, are timeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962) 01-iginal Soundtrack VARESE SARABANDE VSD-5263 Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * * Here is Maurice Jarre in all his glory, combin­ ing synthesizers and unusual instruments like the darbuka with a full orchestra to give himself access to an ever-widening palette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With it, Jarre manages to convey the inner struggle of Lawrence , a struggle never fully articulated in the movie's action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thoughtful, intelligent, but above all dynamic and exciting, the score is a complete triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY 'S (1961) Music from the Motion Pictul-e Scol-e RCA 2362-2-R Performance * * * Sound Quality * * * While not nearly as epochal as his work on Peter Gunn several years earlier, Henry Mancini's jazz stylings have a finger-snapping, hep cat quality that can't be denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the dated use of background singers adds to the charm. "Moon River" stands alone, of course, though it would be given far more definite treatment elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXODUS (1960) Original Soundtrack RCA 105S-2-R Performance * * Sound Quality * This isn't a review of the score for Exodus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a review of the music presented on this CD which, incidenta lly, serves as a paradigm for a botched job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Individual cuts are clearly truncated, almost stopping in mid note at several points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? The movie was about three-and-a-half hours long, so there certainly was no shortage of cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sound also is terrible: thin, harsh, and accompanied by a loud hiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Composer Ernest Gold might well have composed a good or even great piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From this disc, it's impossible to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEN-HUR (1959) Complete Music ft-orn the Film SONY SPECIAL PRODUCTS AK 47021 Performance * * * * * Sound Quality * * * * Asprawling achievement by Miklos Rozsa that quotes liberally from his entire career, sum­ ming up and crowning it in one dramatic act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since he was a great composer and reportedly had an aston­ ishing 18 months to work on the music, one would expect no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singling out individual cuts, however distinctive, would be misleading: Ben-Hul-is a singu­ lar work in the grand tradition, building upon and commenting on itself to achieve its emotional power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (1958) 01'iginal Soundtrack SONY SRCS 7077 Performance * * Sound Quality * * * * The disc features some nice, quiet moments and lovely writing for strings by Dimitri Tiomkin , but the overall effect is uncompelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is just a score and, like the movie, it's all sur­ face-competendy done but never piercing to the heart of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (1957) Original Soundtl-ack SONY SRCS 7072 Performance * * Sound Quality * * * When the Academy Award went to composer Malcolm Arnold, the people who honored him were probably whisding the "Colonel Bogey" march, the one melody everyone who saw the movie remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it was written by Kenneth J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alford (who also contributed a fine march to LaWI-ence of AI-abia) and performed by Mitch Miller and His Orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arnold, who composed and conducted the rest, did a merely serviceable job on the music and-one presumes­ quietly took home the Oscar before anyone could change his or her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CD REVIEW APRIL 1994 ON ... r ....... . ..... 0 ..
