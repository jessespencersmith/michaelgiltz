(Alford wrote a hugely popular article for The New YorkTimes about taking Zumba lessons, which led to this book.) By the time he’s dancing with Alzheimer’s patients as part of their therapy, you’ll be laughing and tearing up at the same time.Read it before the heart-tugging film version does a tango with Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Band’s VisitBook by Itamar Moses; music and lyrics by David Yazbeck $14.95, Theatre Communications Group The musical that swept the Tony Awards (10, including Best Musical) is now available in paperback and e-book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means you can attend a performance of The Band’s Visit onBroadway, watch the marvelous 2007 film it’s based on, listen to the cast album featuring Tonywinners Katrina Lenk and Tony Shalhoub, and now read the book and lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overkill? Hardly.When a show is this subtle and moving, the chance to revisit the story and savor the words isespecially welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s also a master class in adaptation, demonstrating with ease how to bringalive the inner life of characters who keep their own counsel but can’t hide their basic humanityand beating hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Electric WomanBy Tessa Fontaine $27, Farrar, Straus and Giroux Ever want to run away with the circus? In this autobiography, Tessa Fontaine does just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She pivots from helping her mother, who battles stroke after stroke, to finding the courage whenopportunity strikes to join the last traveling sideshow in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, Fontaine istransformed from caregiver to risk-taker: She becomes a snake charmer, an escape artist, andeven Electra, the Electric Woman, while working as a member of Wonder of Wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fontainedoes take inspiration from life in a carnival attraction, but it’s the stories of her fellow artists onthe road that linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it’s a peek behind the scenes and the secrets that go with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forinstance, want to know the secrets of a fire eater? There is no secret: You eat fire by eating fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Mask of ShadowsBy Oscar de Muriel $25.95, Pegasus Books If you want to read about murder in the world of the theater, Shakespeare is always ready to serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is one actor cheating on another in real life? Othello offers up the perfect dialogue for their onstage confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are young lovers kept apart by their families? Romeo &amp; Juliet is the inevitable backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have murder and the supernatural crossing paths, Macbeth conjures the perfect atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This new entry in an Edinburgh mystery series set in the late 1800s hasit all: the Scottish play, the oddball pairing of detectives “Nine-Nails” McGray and Inspector IanFrey, and a backstage crew member named Bram Stoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone waiting for Broadway or theirlocal troupe to revive Deathtrap will be right at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fraver by Design: Five Decades of Theatre Poster Art From Broadway, Off-Broadway, and BeyondBy Frank “Fraver” Verlizzo $34.99, Schiffer Publishing The best theater posters capture the spirit of a show in one indelible image, stand on their own as art, and are powerful ads that make fans reach for their wallets to buy tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fraver byDesign is just as versatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First and foremost, it’s a career retrospective for Frank “Fraver” Verlizzo, one of the most acclaimed artists on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s also a visual treat, bursting withanecdotes about shows, a casual history of the art of theater posters, a behind-the-scenes peekat the selling of Broadway, and a master class in how to go about crafting these works of art.Essentially, this is a coffee table book, a handsomely produced collection of hundreds of classicposters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most every image has a succinct paragraph about it, ranging from amusing storiesto insights on how it was created, or just Verlizzo’s enthusiastic excitement over working with,say, Mia Farrow or the show at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before you know it, you’re knee-deep in stories andknowledge that will be a treat for fans and genuinely useful for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EnsembleBy Aja Gabel $26, Riverhead Books The hothouse-flower atmosphere of a classical string quartet is the rarefied world explored in this acclaimed debut novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jana, Brit, Daniel, and Henry have nothing in common but theirpassionate devotion to classical music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But none of them has any other constant in their livesexcept their music, so they are linked for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, and there’s sex and friendship and betrayaland (sometimes) respect and hard-nosed business decisions and artistic gambles and triumphand tragedy. (It’s not all debates over the pacing of a movement!) Their ensemble, the Van NessQuartet, finds success, and so has author Aja Gabel by capturing the risks and rewards of a lifein the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever the fate of their ensemble, Gabel is clearly off to an excellent start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always Never Yours By Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka $17.99, Penguin Books High-schooler Megan Harper is a prep course for true love: Everyone she dates finds their soul mate … right after breaking up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She can’t direct her love life but Megan can direct plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has her sights set on a career in the theater, but her college application to the idealarts program lacks one required element: an acting credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoping to get by with the smallestrole possible, Megan naturally finds herself cast as Juliet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a nice twist, she doesn’t find love with her Romeo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, it’s classmate and playwright-in-waiting Owen who partners withMegan on her backstage schemes while she helps him with the structure of his own play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If weknow our young adult novels, Megan and Owen will find themselves cast in a real romance bythe end of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thinking Shakespeare By Barry Edelstein $17.95, Theatre Communications Group Director and educator Barry Edelstein knows Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Gopnik of The New Yorker once said Edelstein knows more about Shakespeare than anyone he knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actors anddirectors in the theater already know Edelstein: He’s taught Shakespeare at Juilliard, NYU, USC,the Public Theater, and countless other programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s directed everyone from Kevin Kline toGwyneth Paltrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that’s why Thinking Shakespeare is an essential text for anyone tacklingthe Bard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But theatergoers can benefit just as much from his insight into the world and the characters and the power of these plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You’ll be thinking Shakespeare — and thinking of Shakespeare — in ways you never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limelight By Amy Poeppel $26, Atria/Emily Bestler Books In this frothy follow-up to her bestseller Small Admissions, Amy Poeppel shines the spotlight on teen idols and blockbuster Broadway productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her heroine is Allison Brinkley, a woman who urges her husband and family to embrace her desire to move from a Dallas suburb toManhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’ll be fun!
