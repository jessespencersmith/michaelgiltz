In this autobiography, Tessa Fontaine does just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She pivots from helping her mother, who battles stroke after stroke, to finding the courage whenopportunity strikes to join the last traveling sideshow in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, Fontaine istransformed from caregiver to risk-taker: She becomes a snake charmer, an escape artist, andeven Electra, the Electric Woman, while working as a member of Wonder of Wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fontainedoes take inspiration from life in a carnival attraction, but it‚Äôs the stories of her fellow artists onthe road that linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it‚Äôs a peek behind the scenes and the secrets that go with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forinstance, want to know the secrets of a fire eater?

(It‚Äôs not all debates over the pacing of a movement!) Their ensemble, the Van NessQuartet, finds success, and so has author Aja Gabel by capturing the risks and rewards of a lifein the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever the fate of their ensemble, Gabel is clearly off to an excellent start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always Never Yours By Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka $17.99, Penguin Books High-schooler Megan Harper is a prep course for true love: Everyone she dates finds their soul mate ‚Ä¶ right after breaking up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She can‚Äôt direct her love life but Megan can direct plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has her sights set on a career in the theater, but her college application to the idealarts program lacks one required element: an acting credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoping to get by with the smallestrole possible, Megan naturally finds herself cast as Juliet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a nice twist, she doesn‚Äôt find love with her Romeo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, it‚Äôs classmate and playwright-in-waiting Owen who partners withMegan on her backstage schemes while she helps him with the structure of his own play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If weknow our young adult novels, Megan and Owen will find themselves cast in a real romance bythe end of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thinking Shakespeare By Barry Edelstein $17.95, Theatre Communications Group Director and educator Barry Edelstein knows Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Gopnik of The New Yorker once said Edelstein knows more about Shakespeare than anyone he knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actors anddirectors in the theater already know Edelstein: He‚Äôs taught Shakespeare at Juilliard, NYU, USC,the Public Theater, and countless other programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He‚Äôs directed everyone from Kevin Kline toGwyneth Paltrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that‚Äôs why Thinking Shakespeare is an essential text for anyone tacklingthe Bard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But theatergoers can benefit just as much from his insight into the world and the characters and the power of these plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You‚Äôll be thinking Shakespeare ‚Äî and thinking of Shakespeare ‚Äî in ways you never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limelight By Amy Poeppel $26, Atria/Emily Bestler Books In this frothy follow-up to her bestseller Small Admissions, Amy Poeppel shines the spotlight on teen idols and blockbuster Broadway productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her heroine is Allison Brinkley, a woman who urges her husband and family to embrace her desire to move from a Dallas suburb toManhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôll be fun!
