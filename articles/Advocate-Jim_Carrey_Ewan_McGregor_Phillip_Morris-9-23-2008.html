                <p>o z lGIY ill| 0[YER Ewan McGregor and Jim Carrey bring the true story of con man Steven Russell and his former cell mate and lover to thebig screenrn I Love You Phillip Morris BY MICHAEL GILTZflt M 56 ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; B00l(s 58 ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MUSIG 60 ... and Garrey enjoy life outside ihe prison yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EwAN MccREGon looks pissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's playing the title character, a prisoner, in the new movie I Love You Phillip Morris, and his character has just discovered that a fellow inmate (someone he can't stand) has been beaten up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's upset because everyone is blaming his boyfriend, Steven Russell (Jim Carrey), for the brawl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Morris learns that the gossip is true, that Russell really did or- der the pummeling, he jumps into his boy- friend's cot and coos, "That's the most ) September 23,2008 THE ADvocArE 53sPtcTtI0[ romantic thing anyone's ever done for me." The actors kiss on the lips and roll around until Carrey (now out of character) says to McGregor, "You're getting a little too excited." A beat-down as a romantic gesture? The film's directors-Glenn Ficarra and John Requa-love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sitting in the steamy warehouse set outside New Orleans, Requa leans back with pleasure after McGregor and Carrey finish the scene, and Ficarra shouts, "That was great!" Still, the make-out session needs to be shot several more times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes the kiss is more tender, other times more passionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The one thing that every take makes clear is thatl LoveYouPhiIIip Mor- ris, which the producers hope to see re- Ieased this fall, isn't shying away from showingtwo men in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Romance behind bars may not be re- markable, but the true story the film is based on surely is: Russell was a con art- ist who posed as a chieffinancial officer, a Virginia millionaire, and other powerful figures in order to steal hundreds ofthou- sands ofdollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once a police officer, he was married with children before coming out ofthe closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Furtive affairs finally led to a relationship with his first boyfriend (played by Rodrigo Santoro of Che), who later died ofAIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a conviction for insurance fraud, Russell was placed in Houston's Har- ris County Jail, where he fell quickly and completelyinlove with the redheaded and boyish Morris, who was incarcerated for violating probation imposed for failing to return a rental car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell was so in love that after Morris was released, he repeat- edly broke out of prison (one time literally walking out the front door, dressed as a doctor) to be with his man. "What makes [this movie] different from Catch Me IfYou Can or any other con- man movie is that it's a love story," Requa says. "Some ofthe more shockingelements of the movie-the idea of these men trying to snatch love and bliss in the middle of the most awful environment imaginable-are actually very funny." For Carrey, the story presented a break for him as an actor: to tackle one ofhis most romantic roles yet. "Russell was so mis- guidedly relentless about love that you've got to admire it," Carrey says. "I always try to figure out what delu- sion the character is living under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We all kind of have them, whether it's a feeling of worthlessness or whatever it is," says Car- rey, who shavedbackan inch ofhis hairline to emphasize "the brain" ofhis character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell reportedly has an IQ of169.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To understand the con man's motiva- tions, Carrey had to explore the pain ofRussell's childhood. "When your mother gives you up for adoption and then doesn't want you back when you find her-that definitelyleaves a hole inyou," he says. "It's difficult to trust somebody after that." Trust-and a level of comfort-is some- thing Carrey had to develop with his fellow actors right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because of a tight film schedule, the first scenes he shot were the love scenes with each of his romantic part- ners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He made out with Santoro in a gay bar in Miami on the first day of the shoot, followed quicklyby sex scenes with Leslie Mann (who plays Russell's wife) and then withMcGregor. "It's a very, very amusing scene," McGregor says of his and Carrey's hookup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two are out on a boat, "and I'm giving Steven a blow job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I look up and there's this big huge black storm cloud coming toward us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is true-Steven turns the boat straighttoward the stormbecause he knows that you canlt outrun a storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have to go through the middle," McGregor says. "But Phillip doesn'tknowthis, and it's maybe his queeniest moment, when he has this tiffand screams, 'What the fuck are you doing?' " Carrey jumps in. "I tell him I read it in a magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he asks, 'What maga- zine? Ifyou tellmeTheAdvocate, I'll fuck- ing kill you.' " The real Russell is still in a Texas prison (Carrey was not allowed to visit him).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Morris, who has a nonspeakingrole in the film as Russell's lawyeE is a free man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friendly and charming, the slight 49-year-old Morris seems fit, though he's recovering from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These days helives in Hot Springs, Ark., in the home of a friend, a preacher, and says he's convinced people in his life today won't associate him with the Phillip Morris in the movie. (To be fair, he's not completely tightJipped about the connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Occasionally he delights in tellingpeople-likethe waitress at his favor- ite diner-to Google the movie title) = Morris, who says it's "wonderful" to have e McGregor portray him, isnit dating anyone Z at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the question naturally ; is, 'Are you waiting for Russell?" "No," he F says. "But when he gets out, as far as I'm F concerned, we'll probablybe together." &lt; And by "gets out," does he mean parole I or otherwise? Morris laughs. "Well, you : never know." * 5Directors John Requa (left) and Glenn work with Carrey on a prison scene. 54 THE ADvocATo September23,2008</p>
