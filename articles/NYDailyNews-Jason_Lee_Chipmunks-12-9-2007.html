                <p>Jason Lee brings his nice-guy petsona to the 'Chipmunks' moviO "" MT.HAEL e,urz ctor Jason Lee is promoting his new fmily fllm "Alvin and the Chipmunks" (opening Friday), and that means being griled by the media For the moment, the media is represented by three middle-school girls from Long Island who've won the opportunity to intereiew the acton Armed with glasses of milk, they pepper Lee with questions, and though they know him from his voice work in the movies "Underdog" and "The ./ Incredibles," they're unaware that he appar- ently is on some Tv show called "My Name Is Earl-" 'You've never seen it?" asks I€e Politely. "You should watch it sometime lt's a really good show." The entire scene is sweet, just like the family fiIm he's promoting and indeed just like the 37-year-old Califomia native's entire careef, Since his wry but kind-eyed breakout in di rector Kevin Smith's movies, he's always sought or rector Kevin Smith's movies, he's always sought out good karma by seeking out good roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "Alvin," t€e plays Dave Seville, the human straight man to the titular rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this CGI-sPiked update' a struBgling musician whose lite gets turned upside dom when three talking, singing chipmunks - Simon, The- odore and Alvin - pop up in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They become pop sensations when Dave writes them a holiday tune called"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) " There is, of course, an evil record company executive (David Cross) who must be thwarted before Dave md the gang figure out how to live as a family, though not before Dave hollers "Alvin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alvin! ALVIN! !!!" The goodwill l€e brings.to the frlm is also evident on his hit NBC sitcom "My Name Is Earl." Though it revolvesmustache, which gets annofng, as petty as that seem: don't necessarily tell my agent I only want to do sweet funny or endearing things." So it wasn't a plm to avoid bitter or cynical roles B Lee - who has a 4-year-old son named Pilot Inspektor with his longtime girlfriend, actress Beth Riesgraf - i still reaping the karmic benefits ,.. he thinks "Maybe it's a good thing that no matter how angry I get, I'm still not the fierky guy]," he says. "Or maybe itts a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it mems I would never be able to play Bill the Butcher in 'Gangs of New York' or som thing like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe the audiencejust wouldn't buy Maybe people would just say, 'Oh, that's Earl.'" For the moment, though, Lee is not Earl, since the Miters strike has put TV shows on hiatus and given h an unexpected vacation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A huge fan of road trips' he's plaming to head out in pursuit of another of his pas' iions: photography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And along the way, he'll probably be listening to the band Midlake, a critically acclaime grorip steeped in'70s music like Fleetwood Mac that he's been championing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talking about Mid- lake's driving tbrce - singer md sonBMiter Tim Smi - Lee reveals what's important to himself as well, an what may be the fuel for his laidback nice-guyness. "What Tim Smith is into, he is very passionately inl You have a lot of things these days passed off as iron- ic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's sort of m excuse to like something that wot othemise be considered ridiculous or cmpy," says L who's knom to appreciate the work of Burt Reynoldr and achieved fame as a skateboarder long before the sport became an X Games fixture.
