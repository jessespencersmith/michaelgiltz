"You should watch it sometime lt's a really good show." The entire scene is sweet, just like the family fiIm he's promoting and indeed just like the 37-year-old Califomia native's entire careef, Since his wry but kind-eyed breakout in di rector Kevin Smith's movies, he's always sought or rector Kevin Smith's movies, he's always sought out good karma by seeking out good roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "Alvin," t€e plays Dave Seville, the human straight man to the titular rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this CGI-sPiked update' a struBgling musician whose lite gets turned upside dom when three talking, singing chipmunks - Simon, The- odore and Alvin - pop up in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They become pop sensations when Dave writes them a holiday tune called"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) " There is, of course, an evil record company executive (David Cross) who must be thwarted before Dave md the gang figure out how to live as a family, though not before Dave hollers "Alvin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alvin! ALVIN! !!!" The goodwill l€e brings.to the frlm is also evident on his hit NBC sitcom "My Name Is Earl." Though it revolvesmustache, which gets annofng, as petty as that seem: don't necessarily tell my agent I only want to do sweet funny or endearing things." So it wasn't a plm to avoid bitter or cynical roles B Lee - who has a 4-year-old son named Pilot Inspektor with his longtime girlfriend, actress Beth Riesgraf - i still reaping the karmic benefits ,.. he thinks "Maybe it's a good thing that no matter how angry I get, I'm still not the fierky guy]," he says. "Or maybe itts a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it mems I would never be able to play Bill the Butcher in 'Gangs of New York' or som thing like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe the audiencejust wouldn't buy Maybe people would just say, 'Oh, that's Earl.'"
