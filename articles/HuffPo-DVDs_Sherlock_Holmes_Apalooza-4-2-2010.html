Recommend 64K Like 114 Recommend 489 Recommend 1K Like 302 Like 6K Like 547 Like 15K SHERLOCK HOLMES ($28.98 Warner Bros.) -- London looks like a theme park ride more than a city bristling with danger, the mystery is banal, the villain even banaler (ok, sorry about that one), and Guy Ritchie's film is filled with Holmes making one daring leap after another when of course what Holmes is really known for is one daring leap of logic after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet... and yet, damned if I didn't enjoy myself quite a bit, thanks mostly to the casting of Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as thelong-suffering, quite intelligent Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holmes, like any person with a hint of Asperger's or a touch of autism or just a cranky but brilliant demeanor, hates change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Watson's impending marriage perturbs him no end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their back and forth is far more gripping than the asinine faux mystical threat of avillain who turns out to be just a pawn for the lurking but as yet unseen Professor Moriarty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One restaurant scene captures the truly great film this might have been: Holmes is shown as bombarded with information, his mind incapable of resting and not cataloging snippets of detail and drawing informedconclusions about the larcenous waiter, the lady waiting for a lover, the businessman and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an almost hellish glimpse into the fevered workings of his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holmes as a tortured genius whose greatest weapon is not his brawn but his brain? That's a Holmes I recognize and one that Downey Jr. is perfectlyprepared to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping the sequel lets him do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES ($14.98; Paramount) -- Spectacular stunts? Special effects? Like the new film, this Barry Levinson would-be franchise bobbles a fine idea (Holmes and Watson meeting asboys) and ignores everything that makes the great detective special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, there is no vivid, witty acting to make up for the script's cluelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seemed misguided at the time and certainly hasn't aged well: Holmes has to invent a flying machine to succeed at the finale? Please. 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS camille grammer natalie portman natalie portman pregnant raven symone weight loss rebecca budig More Celebrity News at People.com Dropped From New York Radio Station, TV Ratings Fall Like 6K Kendra Wilkinson Dismisses Divorce Rumors READ MORE John Edwards Is NotEngaged, Says Source READ MORE Is Jane KrakowskiPregnant? READ MORE John Legend Parties WithPauly D, 'Precious' THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES COLLECTION ($129.98; MPI) -- For many years, the Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce films were the definitive image of Sherlock Holmes, even though only two of them were set in Arthur Conan Doyle's day and the rest oddly took place in the 30s and 40s as Holmes and Watson battled Nazis and generally defended Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for all the weaknesses of the later entriesin this 14 part series, Rathbone embodies Holmes so effortlessly that he colored the way we read thestories and novels forever after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How could you not picture him when reading those feats of derring-do? Bruce of course was more bumbling than the original Watson but a fine way for us to at least feel cleverer than someone on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UCLA Theater Archives did a smashing job of restoring all thefilms; they surely look better than the prints we watched and rewatched on TV for all those years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one could ever top Rathbone, could they? SHERLOCK HOLMES: THE COMPLETE GRANADA TELEVISION SERIES ($229.98; MPI) -- Yes, it was simply inconceivable that anyone could ever supplant Basil Rathbone as Holmes...untilJeremy Brett came along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had several advantages over Rathbone: times had changed, so people were ready to embrace the drug habit of Holmes, which surely makes him more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better still, Brettwas performing in episodes actually based on the writing of Conan Doyle, rather than new mysteries thatcould rarely hope to equal the inventiveness of the originals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he was working in a television series, which allowed him to embody the role completely for 41 adventures over a series of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank God it has been remastered nicely with every show presented in order (and God willing, they'll do the same forPoirot some day soon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've seen the shows so many times that I haven't yet watched the whole series in order again, just dipped in to check on the quality of the prints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What made Brett so great was his willingness to embrace the oddness of Holmes, the genuinely strange creature that he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as theseries progressed, he grew increasingly mannered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll have to see it all over again to decide if this was a reflection of Holmes' dissolution over the years (cocaine can be wearing) or Brett simply trying to keep things interesting for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So every generation will provide its own Holmes (and Downey Jr. is a goodone in search of a good script), but it is clear that Jeremy Brett's version is one for the ages and theyardstick by which all others will be measured.TOP VIDEO PICKS Paltrow Dishes on Cruise Kiss Raven Symone's HugeWeight Loss Jessica Szohr's Sobe StripDown 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Natalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During 'Black Swan' 85 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 782 Comments Animal Torture as Entertainment?

J.Lo's Ex's Girlfriend Files For Restraining OrderTHE RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES SET 2 ($59.99; Acorn) -- While I gobbled up the Basil Rathbone movies, this British series from the early 70s was absolutely new to me when Set 1 came out last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a very ambitious show: instead of launching one or even two sleuths akin to Holmes, it's an omnibus of twelve different protagonists (in 13 tales), all based on stories and novels written at the sametime as Conan Doyle and featuring similar Victorian-era heroes (or anti-heroes) dabbling in deduction.Derek Jacobi, Jean Marsh and John Thaw are among the actors who pop in and the central charactersrange from reporters to police inspectors to professors and even a gypsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fun stuff all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALSO OUT ON DVD: THE 39 STEPS ($19.98; BBC) -- To follow on from Holmes, here's the upmteenth version of John Buchan's prototypical adventure tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While faithfulness is admirable in a relationship, it's not always desirable when turning a book into a film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it would be nice if someone actually just filmed the novel for a change, rather than mixing and matching details from the marvelous Alfred Hitchcock film andother versions, throwing in a romance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rupert Penry-Jones is wonderfully unflappable as the hero Richard Hannay, but he's undermined by some very silly plot twists, especially the groaner at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with four or five other Hannay tales to choose from, here's hoping he gets another shot at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strictlyfor spy-loving Anglophiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie Portman Celebrity Skin Models Gulf Oil Spill Celebrity Body GOP LA Shopping Video NFLHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST(SLIDESHOW) 9 Comments THE BLIND SIDE ($28.98 regular and $35.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- This is by no means a good movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this tale of a well-to-do family that takes in a disadvantaged youth and gives him home, security -- and a chance to play football (!) -- has some very admirable qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First and foremost isSandra Bullock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the trailers, I literally feared seeing this film and the scenery-chewing Southernmama I expected her to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Bullock gave quite a restrained, subtle performance (an Oscarwinner no less) in which this woman keeps her emotions to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And other moments are similarly low-key in a nice way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, you can finish some of the dialogue before she does (when a friend says that she's changing this young man's life, you just know she's going to say he's changing hers, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But all inall, a pain-free bit of do-gooding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOY STORY AND TOY STORY 2 ($39.98 BluRay; Disney) -- These new special editions feature the brilliant animated films on BluRay and DVD, with DVD only editions coming out in May when Toy Story 3 comes out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't own the movies, for the love of God buy them right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you do own them, especially the boxed set, is it necessary to upgrade? You will find a new sharpness to the detail, but not so much that anyone but fanatics should feel obliged to shell out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, they surely will come out with a boxed set of all three films in the fall, so this doesn't seem quite the time unless money is no object and you want to show off your BluRay player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These two films are so wonderful, I worried about themmaking yet another sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But every trailer has been so promising, I'm chomping at the bit to see ToyStory 3 and anxiously hoping they've done the series proud.ALVIN &amp; THE CHIPMUNKS: THE SQUEAKQUEL ($29.98 regular, $39.98 BluRay; Fox) -- Whoever coined the phrase "squeakquel" deserved a big fat bonus because that's the cleverest part of this follow-up to the wildly successful live-action launch of the singing chipmunks at the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Leepresumably had better things to do because he appears only briefly at the beginning and the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZacharyLevi of Chuck is an amiable presence but his loser persona is no match for Lee's warm-hearted parental figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chip-ettes are the major innovation here, a trio of singing female chipmunks and that's about it,with lessons learned quickly and painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The interaction between humans and the chipmunks isseamless, which is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But handpuppets would be fine if it meant a better script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The veryyoung will enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AN EDUCATION ($28.96; Sony Pictures Classics) -- Jenny is simply smarter than most everyone around her (or at least thinks she is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's smarter than her parents, surely; smarter than the teachers who counsel caution rather than controversy; smarter than the boys who tentatively woo her; smarter than just about everyone but the handsome, dashing older man who befriends her during a downpourand soon whisks her off to a London in the early 60s filled with fashion and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, Carey Mulligan -- who plays Jenny -- is better than the film that surrounds her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has an impeccable cast including Alfred Molina, Dominic Cooper, Emma Thompson and the always unreliable Peter Sarsgaardas the seducer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also has a screenplay that tries to turn this rather pedestrian tale into somethingunusual, gliding over the rather odd spectacle of two stick in the mud parents charmed by a middle aged Jew with designs on their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saying "it happened" is no defense for not making it believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The denouement is terribly disappointing, as it must have been for Jenny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ButMulligan is a real find.THE LORD PETER WIMSEY MYSTERIES COLLECTION SET 1 ($49.99; Acorn) -- Well, this is a step backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previously, the Ian Carmichael TV shows as Lord Peter Wimsey (a really great mystery series that got better and better with each book) was available in a rather bulky, overpriced boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was crying out for some remastering and a nice new version that packaged them all neatly and simply in a smaller, more compact set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, they've broken it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here you get two adventures, running about ten hours total on three discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's substantial in length but there's not a soul on the planet who wants to own just these two tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they're just as bulky as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fine, foppish series that should have been offered in one complete collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPORTS NIGHT SEASON ONE ($29.97; Shout Factory) -- Ok, here we go again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This show only ran two seasons and has already been released as a complete set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why put out a new edition with only oneseason? Here's my rule of thumb: any show that runs three seasons or less should ONLY be put out in a complete set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who loves the show enough to buy one season surely wants BOTH seasons (or allthree).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And anyone who doesn't want both seasons won't be enticed into just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What would they say? "Oh, I didn't really like that show, but it's only one season, so why not?" I know this can be an expensive proposition for smaller companies and surely Shout has done right by the show with some nice newextras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But personally, I don't really give a hoot about extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're fine, but what I reallywant is the show itself presented as nicely and cheaply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't know it, this is a smart and engaging series about an ESPN-like network, but creator Aaron Sorkin's earnest style really fit the White House far better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great cast, though.THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS ($29.98; Anchor Bay) -- This George Clooney comedy is based on the true-ish stories of the US military's exploration of psychic abilities and the paranormal as potential weapons for war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's spun into a far too elaborate story of a journalist (Ewan McGregor) whostumbles on Clooney and the loony story of psychic research prompted by hippie and career soldier JeffBridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are modest laughs in the film but it has a convoluted structure and takes forever to tell avery slight tale of LSD and competing psychics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't help that the backdrop of 9-11 and prisoner torture takes some of the larkiness out of the goofy tone of the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clooney is game and McGregor was lucky casting: the tons of jokes about Jedi warriors naturally have an added spin here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not much elsedoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FANTASTIC MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOX ($29.98 regular or $39.99 BluRay) -- Here's a more successful George Clooneyfilm, though it's always nice to see how adventurous he can be even when the film falls flat, like The Men Who Stare At Goats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, director Wes Anderson regains his mojo with this stop-motion adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel (about the only one of Dahl's I actually enjoy) in which a fox gets his friends to gang up on the rapacious humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film is modestly ambitious, hoping for and achieving a loopy, low-key note of wry affection for its characters, whether it's the gotta-steal Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox, his under- achieving son (Jason Schwartzman) or his not-so-understanding wife (Meryl Streep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anderson'sobsessiveness pays dividends in the look of the film, which is really a joy to behold and the movie's mainreason for being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's so tactile, so oddly beautiful, you want to reach out and stroke it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: Conan Doyle Expert Fights To Save Author's Home A leading expert on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is pursuing a high court review to overturn planning permission for a developer to carve up the...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meryl Streep's Blue-Tinted Glasses: Cool Or Kooky?

There really was a mk ultra project, they really did this stuff, they really did give acid to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And we really do need to learn a new way to find a way to wage war without violence. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearts and Minds has always been the winning solution.;) as someone who grew up reading Sherlock Holmes (and has read every Holmes story many times over), Ritchie's "envisioni ng" only superficia lly resembles anything Arthur Conan Doyle wrote (and even that's a stretch.) to say that Ritchie's movie is "the truest to the original material" is basicallyadmitting that you've never read any of the original books or stories, and sometimes i wonder ifRitchie himself ever read any of them. i found Ritchie's movie mildly entertaini ng at best, but mostly just wondered how much longer the movie was. i still think Jeremy Brett's Holmes is the yardstick to be measured by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeremy Brett did a fantastic job of portraying Holmes as closely to the original material as possible, something he took pride in.obviously any adaptation will require some concession s, but with Brett's series, those were very few. in fact, when Brett realised how popular it was with children, he and the producers went toDoyle's family and asked if it they could stop mentioning Holme's cocaine addiction so as not tomake it seem as if they were glamorizin g it (ACD's family gladly gave them permission .) this was probably the biggest change to the original material in the BBC series. to this day, whenever i go back and read a Holmes story, i can't help but picture Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson. even in my own little mind, the way they portrayed thecharacters fits in perfectly with the original books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I recently rewatched Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (the Granada series) on Netflix.Most of their episodes are available as Instant View, which uses Silverligh t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beautiful quality!I first saw the series as a young girl and never forgot it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be taken to another place and time, another culture and to hear such richness of theEnglish language, no profanity and feel like another era is opened before your eyes is tosee and experience true entertainm ent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't help but compare the quality of these shows to other shows I see.Permalink | Share it Gasparilla 10:23 PM on 4/06/2010 Permalink | Share it research 07:00 PM on 4/10/2010 Permalink | Share it Cat MacKinnon 03:34 AM on 4/06/2010 Permalink | Share it kkaylynne 02:01 PM on 4/06/2010 Permalink | Share it377 Fans 59 Fans 156 Fans 59 Fans 189 Fans 439 Fans 377 FansI have to agree with most of what Cat MacKinnon says here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a landmark show and not just for Holmes buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes has set the standard for the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another entertaini ng detective series was Cracker starting Robby Coltrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh definitely , Cracker is a very good series -- the UK version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suppose if you are under 30 or raised on MTV then Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes serves as a good Big Mac. ..simply instant gratificat ion with no lingering satisfacti on...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ritchie's Holmes played by Robert Downey Jnr is more Batman ,while his sidekick Watson played by Jude Law is moreRobin.Both men are good actors ,(Downey can be great ..see Charlie Chaplin).Digitally enhanced photoshopp ed pics of Victorian London also ruin this picture .it is simply awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I propose a legal restrainin g order to prevent Mr Ritchie from ever touching another Holmes script .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would like to draw your attention to an earlier production of Sherlock Holmes....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 1965 BBC TVproduction Holmes is played by Douglas Wilmer..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The re -created scenes of London are neitherdigitally enhanced or photoshopp ed... it simply did not exist... execellent scripts and flawless acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The late Nigel Stock plays Watson, no actor has come close to capturing the core character ofHolmes assistant.The late Jeremy Brett portrays the great detective with deep solace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brett's Holmes is a sadbrewding figure who sometimes seems out of place ,even lost in the frenzied world of VictorianLondon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once again no photoshop, no blue screen , no computer animated figures.If you like detective serials where the main character uses his brain instead of a gun to solve crimesyou may like the morose sometimes eratic Inspector Morse,(wri tten by Colin Dexter) and his long suffering assistant Sergeant Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
