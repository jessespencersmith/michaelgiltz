So why group Michael and Crystal as the faux "bottom two?" It just meant everyone knew that Michael was going home after the first 10 minutes of the show but wouldn't know for certain until the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He then reprised "Will You Be There" and if Michael had been that forceful and focused on performance night, he'd probably still be in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of all thecontestants who got to sing in defiance of going home, Michael can take comfort in delivering the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So is it clear cut that Crystal and Lee will be the finalists or can Casey sneak in there? And is it foolish to think Crystal is a lock when last season most people thought Adam Lambert was a lock over Kris Allen?

Because just like Taylor Hicks they are grooming him to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If anyone STILL thinks thatAmerican Idol is not staged then they must be young enough to have Justin Bieber posters overtheir beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it has been a weak season for Idol.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thank heavens, our long national nightmare is over ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FINALLY: "Taylor Swift Getting Honored By Songwriter s' Hall Of Fame" http://www .huffingto npost.com/ 2010/05/11 /taylor-sw ift-gettin g-into_n_5 71804.html And what were they thinking to take this long? She had to put out a second album before theycame to their senses and decided her long career and lifetime achievemen t made her Hall of Fame material. "Phil Collins and music producer Phil Ramone also will receive special awards at the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other inductees include Leonard Cohen...." Come on, what have Phil Collins, Phil Ramone, and Leonard Cohen ever done to be worthy of being honored alongside Ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swift????? ?

Maybe he can write songs too.Bottom line, Crystal should win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she is an un-wed mother, so the God Squad could come afterher also! Overall, a disappoint ing season...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seacrest Out! Please! All Lee has to do is write like Dylan? :) True.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad no one's been able to do it as well in 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Fantasia won, I'm hoping people won't diss Crystal for her personal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excellent point about Fantasia who now looks whole and happy btw-hope she trulyis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have dissed Lee all season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then I heard samples from his album Slumberlan d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The album's really good. he doesn't invoke Dylan, but he's good in his own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As previously stated, only thing I care about is when she breaks out the Bonnie Raitt! lol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I signed up for the trip so I'll ride it through to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe they can just film Crystal's concert back home and run that ! I gave up caring when I saw that everybody they cast this year looked ready made for a photoshoot .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fantasia, Jennifer Hudson, even the heavier Kelly Clarkson would never have made it into thisyears group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And consequent ly the talent suffered for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal is good, but how would she have fared a few seasons ago competitin g against the contestant s from other years on "Disco Night"?

I'll check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our reaction to Ryan's faux Bottom 2 was the same as yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He kind of flubbed that, jmho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If hehad put Michael in with Lee or Casey, there would have been some suspense, but the minute hepaired up Michael with Crystal, everyone knew exactly how it was going to go, including poorMichael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Michael going home, I felt bad for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's very talented; again, jmho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope someone picks him up on a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd like to see what kind of a CD he would put out. (Yeah, I know, I know...ITune and Rhapsody downloads, but some of us STILL will buy the entire CD, if it's good.)Whatever, it's that point in the season where someone's gonna go, good or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C'est la guerre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm absolutely certain Michael Lynche will get a record deal and have at least one stab atsuccess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nice thing about not winning is you don't get rushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So maybe he'll be ableto meet your expectatio ns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think this season's starting to wrap up as almost everyone had assumed... and next week will probably launch Lee and Crystal into the final two for the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Casey may have a shot ofbreaking it up, it's looking tough unless things change momentum-w ise quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, there is also always a chance that we don't know who's really getting the most votes, but since Lee andCrystal have never been in the bottom 3, I'm going to guess it's them. http://the smogger.co m/2010/05/ 13/idol-ha ngover-the -three-to- see/ Great piece, Allen24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree with all your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One more though: Get rid of Randy Jackson.Indeed, he is truly awful this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But let's be honest, he never really offered much in terms ofconstructi ve criticism or personalit y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He should have been ditched years ago with Dunkelman.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST MiraMcB 12:33 PM on 5/13/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 07:22 PM on 5/13/2010 Permalink | Share it MiraMcB 12:28 PM on 5/13/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 07:23 PM on 5/13/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER thesmogger 12:03 PM on 5/13/2010 Permalink | Share it DCDan 07:29 AM on 5/13/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 07:24 PM on 5/13/2010 84 Fans 2 Fans 166 FansDitched with Dunkelman? Ouch! Casey goes on and Mike goes home! Whatever American Idol is, it's certainly not a talent contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just where is the talent of Casey James -- let alone any charisma? Teen and tween voting makes Idol a travesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another one bites the dust! Thank goodness Big Mike is gone! To be honest though - apart from Crystal I really don't care who goes home and when! I am such a huge Idol fan but this year has been a crushing disappoint ment - weak contestant s, bad show themes, disappoint ing eliminatio ns, checked out judges...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I recently wrote a piece on the show - Fallen Idol - with 7 ways to turn the show around ahead of Season 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boy, does Idol need it! http://www .remotepat rolled.com /2010/04/f allen-idol / We liked Michael Lynche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apart from that, I agree with the rest of your remarks, except I don't even really care if Crystal goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that invested in her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think she has talent, butcan't help but wonder how she will do out in the real world once Idol is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No question,she's had a few very good moments, but she has also had some really blah ones, as well.As you pointed out, this has been a really poor season, so I'm wondering if we're justlooking at the best of the worst?
