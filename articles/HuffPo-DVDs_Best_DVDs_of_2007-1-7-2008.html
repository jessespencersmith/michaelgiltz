(My decision: neither; wait till one crashes andburns.) So here's a rundown of my favorite DVDs of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My guiding principle is to highlightDVDs that either introduced me to a movie or TV show I might have otherwise missed (like InBetween Days ) or a DVD whose extras deepened my appreciation of the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I don't want to do is just list the DVD releases of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Ratatouille is one of my favorites of 2007 but since I didn't really explore the DVD extras and it certainly didn't introduce me to the film, it's not listed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look for it on my favorite movies of the year list, coming soon (as soon as I can go see There Will Be Blood and work my way through about 20 more films, that is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy! MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ARKADIN ($49.95; Criterion) -- This Orson Welles oddity can stand in for just about any and every terrific release from Criterion both this andevery year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Criterion outdoes itself with two theatricalversions, a new definitive version, radio playsfeaturing the character and even the complete novel that Welles may or may not have written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I might just as well have included Criterion's impeccableDVD sets for Ace in The Hole ($39.95) or Berlin Alexanderplatz ($124.95) or any of their other releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IN BETWEEN DAYS ($29.95; Kino) -- This well-observed Sundance feature about a South Korean teenager coming of age in a cold, Northeastern town is just the sort of small movie that can slip through the cracks in theaters but get discovered and appreciated on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very promisingfeature by director So Yong Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOYLE'S WAR IV ($59.99; Acorn) - Not the strongest batch of mysteries for this WW II-set British series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Michael Kitchens remains brilliantly incisive as Foyle -- a man of few words whomakes every one count to magnetic effect - and he's surrounded by a top-notch supporting cast ledby the delightfully named Honeysuckle Weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of all, the DVDs contain the entire, uncut Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN ($29.95; Kino) - A beautifully restored new edition of Eisenstein's masterpiece, a film so vital and electric it might have been made tomorrow instead of in the silent era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was torn between choosing this and I Am Cuba: The Ultimate Edition ($44.95), Milestone's beautifully packaged set of that fever dream of a cinematic postcard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are essential for moviebuffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TWIN PEAKS DEFINITIVE GOLD BOX EDITION ($99.99; Paramount) - Finally, the entire series available in one boxed set (including the mysteriously disappearing two hour pilot which wasn't included in the previous Season One set).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loaded with enough extras to sate even the mostfervent fan of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now you can just stop watching once the killer of Laura Palmer is revealedand pretend it's one of the greatest miniseries in TV history instead of a brilliant series that lost itsway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOB DYLAN - Two great musical DVDs about Bob: Don't Look Back 1965 Tour Deluxe Edition ($49.95; Docurama ) included even more footage from that electric moment in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bob Dylan: The Other Side Of The Mirror ($19.98; Sony) simply and perfectly shows Dylan's explosive growth as an artist and a star via three years of performances at the Newport Folk Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I alsoenjoyed Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who ($29.98; Universal) and the absurdly long overdue release of Nirvana Unplugged: Live in New York ($19.98; Geffen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even they comesecond to Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zimmerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND - ($39.95; Sony) - A tremendously entertaining, adult film by Steven Spielberg, who was bedeviled by the lure of TV and theatrical re- releases into endlessly fiddling with this classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, he finally does it justice by offering theoriginal theatrical release along with every other version and a new final, final edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. - THE COMPLETE SERIES ($249.99; Warner Bros.) - An iconic TV series that had passed me by got the deluxe treatment on DVD, which meant I got to see this show for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A silly spy series that got sillier with the passage of time, it's atouchstone for people that grew up with it and fun for those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of all, lavish extraswere clear-eyed enough to discuss the show's artistic stumbles with a fan's loving exactitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andsometimes, just getting the show on DVD at all is reward enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly the case withSaturday Night Live Complete Second Season ($69.98; Universal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Young Indiana JonesVolume Two: The War Years ($129.99; Paramount) offers both the delight of Sean Patrick Flanery Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

PeteBogs See Profile I'm a Fan of PeteBogs permalink Blade Runner: Super Duper Version Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Libsrule, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Movie night is usually after midnight so if you're a late night person you'll be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was late to Firefly despite loving Buffy but really enjoyed the movie and now regret giving away the TV series to my friend John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forbidden Planet is a classic, somehow both well known and still a bit of an obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apples, to be honest I've NEVER been huge on the extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe because it can mean a two hour movie can take ten hours to watch and I'd rather watch three other films in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think RevATHist is right that Blu-Ray may finally have pulled ahead of HD-DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But until one officially collapses, I'm not going to spend my money on either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Libsrule See Profile I'm a Fan of Libsrule permalink Gosh, do you have movie nights at your house with guests and all? Cuz I want to invite myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes I know, that's rude but dang you seem to have such good taste in flicks, and although I don't agree with all of them, I do like reading your take on them and whenpossible and I get the chance I look at them again with a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uh...okay so when's the next movie night and will it entail a plane ticket?As for my favorite DVD's of the year? Well I'm a bit embarrassed to tell you as they will probalby seem all so plebian to you, but I bought the FUTURAMA DVD set and Love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I got Bender's Big Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loved it too but I was still hoping for a new series instead.Dinner Rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just think this is one of those great little movies with an ending that took me by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I bought the DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Picked up FORBIDDEN PLANET The Special Edition..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOVE THAT MOVIE!!MADAGASCAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just love this flick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great animation, humor is all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least three dozen movie references, some obscure and some in your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also ordered the movie I discussed last time HARA KIRU (which I hope you got, it's from criterion) and have watched it twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GODDAMN BUT THAT IS A GREAT MOVIE! I also got the special edition of SERENITY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't know if you ever got into the FIREFLY series but I really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was different and had NO SOUND IN SPACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seemed more real than any science fiction I've encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:10 PM on 01/09/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:10 AM on 01/09/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:47 PM on 01/08/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:33 PM on 01/08/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:46 PM on 01/08/2008Michael Giltz: Best DVDs of 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/best-dvds-of-2007_b_79851.html [4/5/2009 8:04:20 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entryI sent copies of FIREFLY to two friends and they liked it as well...or at least they said they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway, space constraints and all.Oh and I've started looking more into the Criterion library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They got some cool stuff, so NEXT January, let's see what my picks will be then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love your stuff Michael! Apples See Profile I'm a Fan of Apples permalink I think the latest release of 2001: A Space Odyssey may well be my favorite of this past year, particularly in light of the commentary of Kier Dullea and Gary Lockwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not the best commentaryaround, but there was enough new material mentioned there that kept me glued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strangely enough, I've become less interested in the extras than I used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There have been too many 'Making of...' documentaries issued that were really promotional films used for cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I think of the 'Making of...' documentary filmed for, say, Taxi Driver that lasted almost as long as the feature, a PR piece of fluff used to pad out other DVDs doesn't add up to much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, about Blue-Ray...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any ideas when the hi-def situation will level out and it'll be safe to buy one or the other? Jude2004 See Profile I'm a Fan of Jude2004 permalink The Bourne trilogy with cool packaging including a passport containing even more extra features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AsaNisMasa See Profile I'm a Fan of AsaNisMasa permalink Criterion's release of "Breathless" hands down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:04 AM on 01/08/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:44 PM on 01/07/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:57 PM on 01/04/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:30 PM on 01/04/2008</p>
