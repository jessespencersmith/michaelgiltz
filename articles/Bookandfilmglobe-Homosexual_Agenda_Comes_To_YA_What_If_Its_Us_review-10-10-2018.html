                <p>Saturday, February 16, 2019  FICTION Young Adult The Homosexual Agenda Comes To YA Boys Meet Boys and Girls Meet Girls and No One Blinks  October 10, 2018 Michael Giltz The “gay boys in New York” young adult novel What If It’s Us came out (joke!) on October 9 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That same day also saw the release of Dear Evan Hansen , a novelization of the Broadway show that retains the musical’s modest gay-friendly jokes and adds in a gay subplot; Odd One Out by Nic Stone, which includes multiple teen people of color and multiple sexual orientations; and Alan Cole Doesn’t Dance by Eric Bell, a middle grade novel about the further adventures of Alan, who chose to be openly gay one book earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And those are just the ones I know about! The most notable fact about this crush of queer teen novels is how un-notable they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s not Gay Pride Month and having them all be releasedon the same day is pure happenstance, like when gay people meet at a non-gay event, such as when I’d bump into other queer folk in the bleachers atYankee Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh hey, you too? What’s up? Another common thread connecting these books is how grappling with sexual orientation is so not the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever since S.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hinton championedthHo-hum, just another gay YA novelization of a Broadway play ← Lydia Millet’s Fight No More The Best Astronaut Movie That Ever Was →The Outsiders and Judy Blume tackled every social issue imaginable like a one-woman AfterSchool Special, young adult novels have proven admirably realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently, being realistic now includes being blaséabout queerness in all its varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Few authors demonstrate that better than Becky Albertalli (Simon Vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Homo Sapiens Agenda) and Adam Silvera (They Both Die At The End) who have hit home runs commercially with gay teen novels (among others) and now team up to deliver a meet-cute romance between Arthur and Ben.Arthur is from Georgia but visiting NYC for the summer with his lawyer mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben is a proud Puerto Rican New Yorker and they bump into each other at the post office (ok, Arthur stalks him).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They start chatting but a flash-mob wedding proposal separates them (so New York!) and they miss the chance to reconnect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the universe demands they meet up again and so they do, followed by a first date and then a do-over first date and then a third do-over first date and it’s all adorable and entertaining in a non-demanding way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both their parents and friends are beyond supportive and if it weren’t for a jerk on the subway who can’t handlethem snuggling in front of his kid, you’d swear this wasn’t set in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel is pleasant enoughand zips by and is thoroughly undistinguishable from a thousand other boy-meets-girl teen romances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And isn’tthat pretty awesome? Sure, it’s been-there, done-that for adults who’ve read this stuff before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for queerteens, it will probably be like that first kiss they’ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What If It’s Us by Becky Albertalli &amp; Adam Silvera(October 9, 2018; HarperTeen) Tags: Adam Silvera , Becky Albertalli , Dear Evan Hansen , gay YA , Judy BlumeHigh In the Air (An Everest Novel)  February 13, 2013 Judy Blume: TheConscience of a Young Adult Nation  May 27, 2015 A Good Book by a Good Guy  January 6, 2015 Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for many outlets, such as New York Post,New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Huffington Post, PremiereMagazine, Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's co-host of the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox. You May Also Like Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required fields are marked * CommentName * Email * WebsiteSubscribe to our mailing list Social Twitter Facebook Recent Posts The Eyes Don’t Have It The Kids are Not All Right Nasty, Brutish, and Short ‘Isn’t It Romantic?’ 31 Days of Oscar–Week Three Recent Comments Delores Sundbye on The New York Times Sends an Assassin to Kill Leonard Cohen Sharyn on Apocalypse Zhao Self-publishing News: Indies at the Movies | Alliance of Independent Authors: Self-Publishing Advice Center on Apocalypse ZhaoCasey on Apocalypse Zhao hng23 on The New York Times Sends an Assassin to Kill Leonard CohenArchives February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018May 2017 February 2016 May 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014March 2014 December 2013 September 2013 April 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012July 2012 November 2011 September 2011 June 2011 May 2011 March 2011 May 2001March 2001October 2000 August 2000 July 2000 June 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999October 1999 September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999March 1999 February 1999 September 1998 June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 February 1998October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 June 1997 May 1997 April 1997 March 1997February 1997 January 1997November 1996 September 1996 August 1996 June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 February 1996 January 1996 October 1995August 1995 February 1995 January 1995Copyright © 2019, Book and Film GlobeAbout Us | Terms &amp; Conditions | Privacy Policy | Advertise with us | CONTACT INFO EDITOR – Neal Pollack – neal@bookandfilmglobe.com GENERAL MANAGER/ADVERTISING – Kevin Sanders – ksanders@seaofreedsllc.com – 201-724-0340 VISIT OUR SUITE OF SITES</p>
