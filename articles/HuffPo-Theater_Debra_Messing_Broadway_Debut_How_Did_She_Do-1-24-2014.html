Even though he's always felt it to be amillstone around his neck? Unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two families spar with the ease of old acquaintances, both elderlyfolk readily admitting they're not long for this world and both young (okay, middle-aged) children insisting they'refine with their limited prospects.It's clear Tony should leave the farm to his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's clear Anthony and Rosemary are...well, not made for eachother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're too ornery and set in their ways and just plain odd for all that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're certainly not made foranyone else, not as far as they're both secretly concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it just makes sense, them two together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe.Two obstacles remain: one of them a disputed bit of land and the other a Secret of Anthony's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, OutsideMullingar keeps that Secret just a modest secret, so it doesn't build up anticipation for a truly offbeat revelationthat takes an actor of O'Byrne's immense skill to put over.As the two parental figures, Maloney and Molloy are very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Molloy especially might have been forgiven forpumping up her part by stealing more laughs than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she is wisely content to let her presenceremain exactly as it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the play is filled with humor, though only the final scene has the romanticloopiness of Moonstruck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first few scenes have more substance, more drama, than one might expect andTony's deathbed confession is quietly moving.Playing the two lonely souls so set in their ways they are in danger of remaining so forever, O'Byrne and12/7/2015Theater: Debra Messing's Broadway Debut -- How'd She Do? | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=7257f67e-96bf-4816-b1e7-a06957e6b91e&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/2Messing have wonderful chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Messing's accent is the sole shaky aspect, though not damagingly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shehas the comic chops to sell her frumpy, determined character and the confidence of a pro not to oversell it.O'Byrne centers the show on his capable, quiet shoulders, carrying the burden with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All credit to directorDoug Hughes for molding them into a fine ensemble.But Hughes must also take the blame for a physical production that lets the actors -- and Shanley's play -- down.Perhaps the great John Lee Beatty was given too much money? His production design is bizarrely over-complicated when one can easily envision how the play could be done in one set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would in fact reinforcethe essential sturdiness of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead the kitchen and living area of the first scene rotates out and away tomake room for an ugly outdoor scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It features a timid sliver of a barn roof filled with hay and a mechanicaldownpour of rain that has such symmetrical drops of water evenly spaced apart across the stage that it looksmore like the beginnings of a Busby Berkeley number than an Irish downpour.A later scene in the neighbor's kitchen is so identical to the first you wonder why they bothered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And though theplay is filled with a love of the land, we get no sense of the outdoors whatsoever. (One might also fault thelighting of Mark McCullough but since he has nothing of note outdoors to light this seems churlish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast,the costumes of Catherine Zuber and the wig and hair designs of Tom Watson are fine.) While the sound designof Fitz Patton does its job unobtrusively (as it should), his modest score feels distractingly chirpy in betweensome scenes (as if reassuring the audience that more romantic moments are ahead) and just plain bland whenthe audience is exiting.The only touch that justifies the expense is seeing the deathbed of Tony slip backwards into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butunquestionably the play would have a stronger sense of space and just feel more rooted if it took place onessentially one set, a very easy fix and one that will surely benefit the show when it is performed regionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andperformed it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a less than ideal physical presentation, this is a very well-acted production of aquietly ambitious work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It deserves to be a hit and will surely have a long life ahead of it across the country andacross the pond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if a funny, moving, sweet and romantic charmer like this with a big-name (and talented) TVstar can't draw the audience it deserves, god help the future of original plays on Broadway.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical ***Rodney King *** Hard Times ** 1/2 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead ** I Could Say More * The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner ** Machinal *** Outside Mullingar ***</p>
