                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , A U G U S T 0 3 , 2 0 0 5Is This How Bush Was Hazed At His Frat?by Michael in New York on 8/03/2005 12:22:00 PMThe Washington Post on US soldiers' brutal treatment ofprisoners, all of which they believed was "approved" fromabove.Iraqi Maj.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abed Hamed Mowhoush was being stubbornwith his American captors, and a series of intense beatingsand creative interrogation tactics were not enough to breakhis will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the morning of Nov. 26, 2003, a U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armyinterrogator and a military guard grabbed a green sleepingbag, stuffed Mowhoush inside, wrapped him in an electricalcord, laid him on the floor and began to go to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again.It was inside the sleeping bag that the 56-year-old detaineetook his last breath through broken ribs, lying on the floorbeneath a U.S. soldier in Interrogation Room 6 in thewestern Iraqi desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two days before, a secretCIA-sponsored group of Iraqi paramilitaries, working withArmy interrogators, had beaten Mowhoush nearlysenseless, using fists, a club and a rubber hose,according to classified documents...."The indig were hitting the detainee with fists, a club and alength of rubber hose," according to classified investigativerecords.Soldiers heard Mowhoush "being beaten with a hardobject" and heard him "screaming" from down thehall, according to the Jan. 18, 2004, provost marshal'sreport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said four Army guards had to carryMowhoush back to his cell.Not exactly "Animal House," is it? Mowhoush was killed, of course."The interrogation techniques were known and wereapproved of by the upper echelons of command of the 3rdACR," [the lawyer for one of the soldiers] said in a newsconference. "They believed, and still do, that they wereappropriate and proper."And you know what? They were wrong to do what they did, but rightto believe the people in power were all for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush has made thatperfectly clear again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If not, why has no one in chargeduring these outrages been reprimanded in the least? Why insteadhas almost everyone involved been promoted and praised? This is thesort of vile nastiness we used to condemn the bad guys for -- the sortof cruel, nasty torture our soldiers endured from the OTHER sideduring Vietnam and Korea and from the Nazis and the Japs in the lastrighteous war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not a sign of strength -- torture is always a sign ofweakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it is beneath the dignity of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE POSTS ABOUT: TORTURE HuffPost PoliticsMichael Shaw: Reading the Pictures: As If This PutsBirthers To Bedt - click for full size Seeing isbelieving? via RJ Eskow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart escalates....24 minutes ago FiredoglakeLate Late Night FDL: Holiday Road - LindsayBuckingham - Holiday Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not headed toWallyworld but I am on the road tonight, headeddown to the San Francisco Bay Area for themeetup this...1 hour ago Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's RescueRangers are noddem, Elise, jlms qkw, taylormattd,Shayera, and joyful with vcmvo2 editing.* Thediaries up for rescue are: - *Vikin...2 hours ago Crooks and LiarsOpen Thread - Just a little something re the birtherthing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open thread below...2 hours ago EschatonLate Night - Go Electric.2 hours agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Next 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Is Thi...http://www.americablog.com/2005/08/is-this-how-bush-was-ha... 1 of 57/24/09 11:15 AMVisit ourAMERICAblog TV site.see all 326 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod Massive brawl in SouthKorean parliament Mormons may havesecretly baptized Medieval helpdesk withEnglish subtitles The Taco Bell dog hasdied In honor of SenatorDeMintAMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Is Thi...http://www.americablog.com/2005/08/is-this-how-bush-was-ha... 2 of 57/24/09 11:15 AMWalker ReportSimple Test ToDetermine If Conrad'sCo-ops Are Worthless2 hours agoEzra KleinTab Dump6 hours agoWonk RoomNewt Gingrichâ€™s â€˜JobsFirstâ€™ Plan Puts TheWealthy AndCorporations First9 hours agoHealth BeatIf Weâ€™re Able to StopObama On This . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ItWill Break Him9 hours agoDaily DoseObama Talks HealthCare With Post's Hiatt10 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
