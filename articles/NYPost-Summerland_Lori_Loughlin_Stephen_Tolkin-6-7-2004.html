                <p>One hot, sizzlin WB hit a smart move for 'Full House' star By MICHAEL GILTZ Ghlo1 THE summer has its first hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new drama "SummerÂ­ land," which began last week, was the highest-rated debut in two years for the WB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the only reason the show exÂ­ ists is because star Lori Loughlin, the star of the early '90s hit "Full House," didn't want to look dumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story goes like this: When the WB called to set up a meeting, Lori knew one of the first questions would be whether she had any ideas for a series. "I didn't want to say no; I did it out of not wanting to look dumb," laughs Loughlin, who suddenly looks very smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She plays Ava Gregory, a fashion designer who quits her job and sudÂ­ denly finds herself saddled with three kids after her sister and brother-in-law die in an accident. "I was in Hawaii on a family vacation when my agent called me about the meeting," says the 39-year-old actress, who is married to fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli. "I hung up the phone and walked out on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I might have had a cocktail; I can't remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought, 'What can I do?' "I didn't want to be the mom ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then I thought of this woman who -boom! -one day her life changes on a dime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wrote it out in longhand and my son, who is 12 [her husÂ­ band's child from a previous marriage], typed it up on the computer. "He got to name the three kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I said, 'Give me a cool name for a boy.' And he said, 'I think Bradin's a cool name.' So that's pretty cool; he got to name all the kids on this show." No one was more surÂ­ prised than Loughlin when the executives said they loved it and asked her to meet with Aaron Spelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led to Stephen TolÂ­ kin, a Spelling protege who writes and is an executive producer on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He made his own contribution to the name game. "I met with Lori at the Polo Lounge and said, 'You know, Ava Gardner probably sat at this table,' " says Tolkin. "And we said, 'Ava!' And that's how we named her charÂ­ acter." With teenagers in lust and an oceanfront setting, comparisons to "The O.C.," Fox's summer hit from last season, are inevitaÂ­ ble. " 'The O.C.' is my favorite show," says Tolkin. "I'm addicted to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this show, I wrote the entire pilot before I ever saw it." Besides, "The O.c." is a classic soap, says Tolkin. "Summerland" is more a family drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And with a lot more surfing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the show, 16-year-old Bradin (played by 16-year-old Jesse McCartney) takes up surfing and develops an immediate crush on his instructor, Erica (TayÂ­ lor Cole). "Basically, on 'The O.C.,' Peter Gallagher walks in with wet hair and a surtboard,"laughs Tolkin, brother of screenÂ­ writer Michael Tolkin ("The Player") and son of a head writer on "Your Show of Shows." "We're really going to use the beach." One review put the series down as "Full Beach House." But the only reÂ­ views that matter -the ratings - have been terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In New York and Atlanta, in fact, "SumÂ­ merland" beat every other network. ~ Loughlin got waves of congratulatory phone calls, and Tolkin said his mother-inÂ­ law even heard people talking about it at the opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently, the WB knew what it was doing by launching their best shot at a breakout hit in the first weeks of sumÂ­ mer. "This show was meant to be shown in the summer," says Tolkin. "It screams summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's called 'Summerland' after all."</p>
