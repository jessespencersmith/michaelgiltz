(And while we're dreaming, a reallysmart greatest hit set from most classic sitcoms like I Love Lucy and MASH and Seinfeld others would bewelcome -- sometimes you don't actually want 100+ episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look at The Andy Griffith Show to see how it'sdone when creating a greatest hits set.) And now, on with a roundup of new releases....ALL IS LOST ($29.99 BluRay combo; Lionsgate) ENDER'S GAME ($39.99 BluRay combo; Summit/Lionsgate) WADJDA ($40.99 BluRay combo; Sony Pictures Classics) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB ($34.99 BluRay combo; Universal) YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON ($24.98 BluRay combo; Well Go) THE BEST MAN HOLIDAY ($34.99 BluRay combo; Universal) THE ARMSTRONG LIE ($35.99 BluRay; Sony) WATCHTOWER ($24.99 DVD; Film Movement) --Three major films came out that seemed vaguely linked as one person against the odds: Gravity, CaptainPhillips and All Is Lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best of the lot -- and the least seen -- is All Is Lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Redford stars in thisalmost wordless movie about a man on a boat trying to survive a storm and shipwreck at sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't tell my portfrom my starboard and never could quite figure out flotsam versus jetsam, but I was gripped from beginning toend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was delightful to see Redford -- a terrific actor -- in a role worthy of his talents for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hadreservations about the finale but on reflection and comments from others, I now am more open-minded about12/7/2015DVDs: Hill Street Blues, Wonder Years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Show Should Be Next? | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=9374a263-ffb2-4e75-8f6f-fbba9d1ccfc1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/6what I think and what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the extras will illuminate the director's intent, but overall this is one ofthe purest examples of cinema you'll see this year and a nail-biter to boot.Similarly, Harrison Ford has also struggled to adapt to older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redford just stopped making movies, with anoccasional return in some awful flick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ford has finally let go of leading man roles and is having fun in supportingturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His work in 42 was better -- and that was a better film -- but here he is in Ender's Game beingcurmudgeonly for this would-be franchise that stumbled out of the gate, only making $90 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thestudio shouldn't feel too bad: given the other wordy, increasingly dull books in the series, this was never anatural for sequels anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel remains the perfect gateway drug for boys who claim they don't like toread.Wadjda is a solid film made in Saudi Arabia -- by a woman! -- and featuring a charming lead performance byWaad Mohammed as a cheeky, willful little girl who yearns for a green bicycle even though girls aren'tencouraged to ride bikes at all in this repressive country where women are not even allowed to drive cars.Director Haifaa Al-Mansour isn't just the first woman to shoot a film in Saudi Arabia, she's the first person to evershoot an entire film in that country which doesn't even technically have movie theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a small miracle andhopefully this modest, quietly subversive charmer will be the first of many.I was hoping for at least two strong lead performances amidst some earnest filmmaking when I watched DallasBuyers Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No such luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fault does not lie with Matthew McConaughey or Jared Leto -- two fine actors.They're simply stuck in a vapid, confusing script that barely creates any characters or conflict, seemingly soenamored to be making the movie at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tale is about a straight man (McConaughey) who gets AIDS andthen gleefully dives into the black market for drugs that might actually work, science and the rules be damned.Leto has the worst of it, saddled with the old tragic queen role -- shunned by family and doomed to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Themovie is so uninterested in its characters that Leto's lover barely has a name or a word of dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The womanwho ends up running the clinic with them is similarly no-named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one small but typical bit of confusion, Leto isin the hospital with a severe medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McConaughey returns from a business trip (in the era beforecell phones) and of course neither man has any family or friends to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The office manager realizesMcConaughey hasn't heard, tells him the bad news and then inexplicably says, "I thought you knew." Well, hell,unless she told him, how would she ever think he knew? No one else would have a clue where he was or how toreach him but her, so what could she be thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, the movie begins with McConaughey so frighteninglyskeletal, the fact that his coworkers at the rodeo aren't all saying, "Dear God man, get to a hospital and find outwhat's wrong!" is astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't care if it "really happened." As presented, it's unbelievable, as is the rest ofthis shoddily made, confusing, if well-intentioned bit of nonsense.Young Detective Dee: Rise Of The Sea Dragon is also nonsense, but it revels in that sense of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It hasvirtually nothing to do with the clever detective stories about Judge Dee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it is a good excuse for fantastical,martial-arts infused action and Raiders-style fun amidst the sleuthing/adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expect more to come.What took them so long? Young Detective Dee is the prequel that was apparently greenlit before the original hittheaters, it came out so fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, The Best Man Holiday took 14 years to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results aremodest, even forgettable, but hey, the cast is starrier than ever and fun to see back together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Best ManVacation surely won't take so long.The Armstrong Lie is almost too depressing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lance Armstrong built a career around a lie: a manovercoming cancer through work and grit and talent. instead, the real story was a man cutting corners andcheating to get ahead and then egotistically lying to one and all for years, slurring and defaming former friendsand associates all because he was too cowardly to admit he'd been a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, cycling is fraught withcheaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't excuse him and certainly doesn't excuse willingly throwing others under the bus becausethey got tired of the lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This film was being made as the lies unraveled and caught it all.12/7/2015DVDs: Hill Street Blues, Wonder Years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Show Should Be Next? | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=9374a263-ffb2-4e75-8f6f-fbba9d1ccfc1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/6Watchtower is a film festival treat, a quiet, observant, slow-moving but absorbing Turkish film about a man and awoman with troubled pasts who come together tentatively, but with real desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was rescued from obscurity byFilm Movement, which has built a business and monthly movie club around highlighting the movies that gotacclaim at festivals but for whatever reason didn't get a theatrical release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can sit through ten movies inToronto or Cannes before finding one good one, so more power to them; they present movies direct on DVDand also make theatrical releases happen in major markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here's to keeping an eye out for writer-directorPelin Esmer's next movie.THE JUNGLE BOOK DIAMOND EDITION ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) MOON MAN ($26.99 DVD; Cinedigm) --If you enjoyed Saving Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks, you're surely aware that the talented songwriting team The Sherman Brotherswrote the brilliant score for Mary Poppins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also worked on the songs for The Jungle Book (though not "TheBare Necessities," which was written by Terry Gilkyson -- and arranged by Van Dyke Parks!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those songs are ahighlight from this film, the best of the lot from its era and a final achievement by Walt Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was the lastanimated film he oversaw and of course Mary Poppins was the live action triumph he made happen as wellbefore dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk about going out on top! This sparkling new edition looks just great.Moon Man is a far more modest affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on the children's book by Tomi Ungerer, it shows the Man in theMoon coming down to earth to check things out, freaking out major governments and making it impossible forkids to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a hippy, dippy charm, served well by the sometimes psychedelic animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not akeeper, perhaps, but worth a look.GAME OF THRONES COMPLETE THIRD SEASON ($79.98 BluRay; HBO) SHERLOCK SEASON THREE ($39.98 BluRay; BBC Home Entertainment) NURSE JACKIE SEASON FIVE ($39.97 BluRay; Lionsgate/Showtime) DALLAS COMPLETE SECOND SEASON ($39.98 DVD; Warner Bros.) HETTY WAINTHROPP INVESTIGATES COMPLETE COLLECTION ($119.99 Acorn) NEWHART COMPLETE SECOND SEASON ($29.99 DVD; Shout Factory) DOCTOR WHO: THE MOONBASE ($24.98 DVD; BBC Home Entertainment) THE WHITE QUEEN ($59.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay/Starz) --Game Of Thrones keeps getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a truly great series yet (Peter Dinklage can only do somuch) but it is great fun indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is also feeling their oats, the salacious bits of nudity at every turn havecalmed down a bit and the mother of dragons cannot be stopped! Nothing like it has ever been achieved on TV:fantasy has always been campy or low-budget and just plain awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now to go alongside the sci-fi classics TVhas produced for decades, we finally have its first classic fantasy series.Sherlock may have turned the corner in season three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman have beenawash in work, so it's no wonder the seasons amount to just a frustrating three TV movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That should keep thequality up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, the show has edged into camp, seeming to go from a tad lighthearted to out spoofing ofitself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the two leads are so appealing it makes the nonsense visuals (like the idiocy that happens wheneverHolmes dares to stop and think) just bearable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amusing touches are fine, but let's hope they rein in the jokinessdown the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, at this rate, it would take them 50 years to work their way through the canon so we'vegot loads of time to adjust.The drama -- yes, drama -- Nurse Jackie has perhaps exhausted its quotient of melodrama, though Edie Falcoremains a pleasure to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's hope the sixth season will be the last and let the show wind things up beforemaking a hash of the storylines they've put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, keep her on the wagon!Goodbye, J.R.! That's the main reason to tune into the soapy soap Dallas Season Two, which incorporated thereal-life death of Larry Hagman into the show's storylines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The posters promoting the new season -- with the12/7/2015DVDs: Hill Street Blues, Wonder Years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Show Should Be Next? | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=9374a263-ffb2-4e75-8f6f-fbba9d1ccfc1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;4/6cast sexily immersed in oil -- are fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show? Not nearly as much as it should be, though I'm always happy towatch Jesse Metcalfe emote.I really must stop forgetting that actors are in fact acting! Patricia Routledge is so firmly ensconced in my mindas the helplessly snobbish working class woman Hyacinth Bucket (Bouquet!!) in Keeping Up Appearances that Iforgot she could play other roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here she is charming in a very different manner as Hetty Wainthropp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inthis complete collection of mysteries, we see her facing retirement with a firm desire to do something useful andfun, so why not solve murders? Future hobbit Dominic Monaghan is on for part of the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amiable fun.I was always glad to see Bob Newhart in a primetime hit again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just never thought much of Newhart, the showwhere he ran an inn in Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the biggest hit of his career, though of course The Bob Newhart Show is theone we'll all remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, anytime he gets to carry on a phone conversation with an unseen caller iswelcome and it was all worth it for that final episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But reviewing some of these episodes makes clear theyreally were pretty thin in the humor department.A new Doctor is coming! But what to do until then? Why dive into earlier adventures of Doctor Who.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really onlywatched the Tom Baker years until the reboot with Christopher Eccleston so I've got a lot of catching up to do.When I was less than one year old, then-Doctor Patrick Troughton was landing on the moon in the year 2070,getting accused of starting a plague and trying to clear the whole mess up in Doctor Who: The Moonbase.Missing episodes are filled in here with animated ones (which let's you know the devotion of Who fans rightthere) and as always, the BBC loads this complete adventures with literally loads of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're a fanaticand have deep pockets, these are catnip.Once upon a time, an event like The White Queen would have been unthinkable on anywhere but a majornetwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now countless channels turn out co-productions and original series with similar lavish casts andHollywood production values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This BBC miniseries (miniseries because it wasn't renewed for season two) isbased on novels by Philippa Gregory set during the War Of The Roses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rebecca Ferguson is the heroine of thetitle and the great Janet McTeer is her mother, amongst a large and generally talented cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Starz here inthe US is looking to make another miniseries happen; it would be called The White Princess and would bebased on the same series of novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, you can start diving into the books right now.ROCKY HEAVYWEIGHT COLLECTION ($ BluRay; Fox/MGM) ESCAPE PLAN ($39.99 BluRay combo; Lionsgate) CHICAGO ($14.99 BluRay combo; Lionsgate) KING OF THE HILL ($39.99 BluRay combo; Criterion) DARKMAN ($29.93 BluRay; Scream Factory) GOTHAM CITY SERIALS: BATMAN and BATMAN AND ROBIN (1943, 1949) ($9.99 DVD; Mill Creek) TRANS-EUROP-EXPRESS ($39.95 Kino Lorber) THE ARTIST AND THE MODEL ($39.98 BluRay; Cohen Media Group) FESTIVAL EXPRESS ($24.99 BluRay; Shout Factory) --Rocky is coming to Broadway as a musical (!) so that's clearly the excuse for repackaging the six Rocky films inthis new BluRay set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, they've remastered the first and best Rocky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new modest extras are somehome movies shot by the film's director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone suggested that Rocky winning Best Picture against TaxiDriver, Network, Bound For Glory and All The President's Men was an embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many manytimes Oscar nominates BAD movies for Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1976, five films came out and got the nod and they wereall good and all would make my list of the best movies of that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, I would have voted for All ThePresident's Men, but that doesn't make Rocky a bad choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Save your ire for The Greatest Show On Earth,Around The World In 80 Days, Gandhi and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not Rocky.Sylvester Stallone is still at it, with he and Arnold Schwarzenegger fighting their way out of the toughest prison12/7/2015DVDs: Hill Street Blues, Wonder Years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Show Should Be Next? | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=9374a263-ffb2-4e75-8f6f-fbba9d1ccfc1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;5/6ever created in Escape Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just as witless as it sounds and no good calling card for the former governor.Chicago is another Oscar winner for Best Picture that wouldn't have received my vote. (I would have plunkeddown for The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers), but better Chicago than any of the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here it is 11 (!)years later in a new combo pack and what a bargain those are becoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a BluRay, a DVD and a digitalcopy for $15 (and cheaper on sale).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's some razzle dazzle.Director Steven Soderbergh has made so many movies in so many different genres and styles, it's no surprisewe're still catching up to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of his best early films that has gone unappreciated is King Of The Hill, athoughtful coming of age period piece with a terrific cast (including Lauryn Hill) and great, sensitive direction bySoderbergh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Criterion does it proud and talk about an extra: you also get a DVD of Soderbergh's similarly blink-and-you-missed-it crime flick The Underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They won't change my mind about Kafka, but his career whichseems so scattered while it's happening may look a lot better on reflection.Sam Raimi made better films before and after but comic book fans love their superheroes so Darkman hasalways had its fierce adherents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liam Neeson had his first shot as an action figure playing a scientist turnedcrime-fighter and Raimi was working out ideas that would bear fruit with Spiderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a great hero needs agreat villain and Larry Drake of L.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Law doesn't even come close to the gravitas and scare factor needed here.Fans of course will gobble Darkman up, just as fans of Batman who are really hardcore will check out this DVDcontaining two serials from the 1940s starring the Caped Crusader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first, Lewis Wilson is Batman andDouglas Croft is Robin, the boy wonder (he was 16 at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because the war is on, they're fighting aJapanese plot to turn our scientists into zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second, a new Batman and Robin take on The Wizard.It's all creaky stuff, done in the low-budget breathless style that serials invariably were reduced to and is strictlyfor serious fans only.Ah art films! In the 1950s and 1960s, sophisticated filmgoers (and those that longed to be) dove into art filmsprecisely to be puzzled and intrigued by the meta-plotting of movies like Trans-Europ-Express, where Jean-Louis Trintignant plays both himself as an actor and the gangster he's going to portray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all makes sense of asort and if audiences couldn't figure it out they would insist that was the point and book a room at Marienbad.More purely, people went to foreign films for the promise of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Artist and the Model has that in spades,since it features an elderly sculptor forming a fond attachment with the voluptuous nude model he's using for hislast work, a piece that might well be his masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with all those films years ago, this proves to be lesssalacious than arty as the aging artist imparts wisdom and his views on life to his captive audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, ittitillates and that's enough.Festival Express is a curio of a concert film/documentary showing the freewheeling era when a bunch of bandswould decide to tour together by getting on a train and going from town to town and having one big party theentire way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not great, but it's a fascinating document and fans will savor the on-board jams where artists ofvarious ilk like Janis Joplin are just sitting around making music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This new release includes a making-of andsome more extras, namely bonus performance footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worth a look.LAVERNE &amp; SHIRLEY SEVENTH SEASON ($42.99 DVD; Paramount) GENTLE BEN SEASON TWO ($29.99 DVD; CBS/Paramount) FAMILY MATTERS COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON ($29.98; Warner Bros.) JOANIE LOVES CHACHI COMPLETE SERIES ($29.99 DVD; Paramount) --It's a golden age of television and if any kids out there don't believe you, make them watch an entire season ofany one of these series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Witless, bland, unfunny and downright godawful -- that's what these are and they'revery typical of fare that dominated in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can almost imagine what the actors werethinking.12/7/2015DVDs: Hill Street Blues, Wonder Years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Show Should Be Next? | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=9374a263-ffb2-4e75-8f6f-fbba9d1ccfc1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;6/6Penny Marshall: When can I direct and I wish I were back on The Mary Tyler Moore Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or The Odd Couple.Or Paul Sand In Friends And Lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or anything.Clint Howard: A bear?
