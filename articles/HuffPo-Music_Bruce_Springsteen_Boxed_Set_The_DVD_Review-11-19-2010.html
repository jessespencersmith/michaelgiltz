It all comes in a boxed set that is oversized (which I hate) but for a purpose: the case holding the discs isalso a reproduction of one of the many notebooks Springsteen filled to overflowing with song lyrics, sometimes including endless variations on a particular song until he got it just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a blast to pore over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Movies | Celebrity Kids | Rihanna | Mila Kunis | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 31 Democratic Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot, Federal Judge Killed At Public Event Suspected Arizona Shooter Identified: Disturbing YouTube Videos, MySpace GOP Congresswoman Caught In Sexually Suggestive Photos What Not To Say When Your Loved One Is Upset How To Tell If It's Really Food: A Flowchart Marty Kaplan The "Lock and Load" Rhetoric of American Politics Isn't Just a Metaphor Sarah Palin Renounces Arizona Shooting Facebook Shutdown Rumors Go Viral Recommend 41K Recommend 8K Like 809 Like 986 Like 9K Like 2K Like 12K Recommend 17K Almost every review talks about his classic album and the bonus CDs with a brief mention at the end of the three DVDs in this boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm going to focus on the DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DVD one contains The Promise: The Making Of Darkness On The Edge Of Town, directed by Thom Zimny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a delight, filled with classic archival footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm intrigued by the idea that Springsteen was wary of fame but also let a film crew intohis rehearsals for days and weeks on end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie features in-depth interviews with all the band members as well as Springsteen's once estranged manager Mike Appel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Locked in a court battle over control of his career, Bruce was kept out of the studio for literally years after the titanic success of BornTo Run, which landed him on the cover of Time and Newsweek .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film captures well the tension of the times, how two or three years between albums was an eternity back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This happened, ironically, when the music was pouring out of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Steven Van Zandt says, before this album they just came up with the next 10 or 12 good songs and then recorded them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But instead of coming up with about ten songs, like he did for Born To Run (ultimately including only eight), this time he was writing more than 70 songs, an explosion of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every artist has to believe they're going to change the world and rewrite the rules to achieve greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one of the quotes that jumps out at you, Springsteen says that at the time, more than fame and wealth, more than happiness, he wanted to begreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They describe tossing out great songs that just didn't fit the album, crafting a coherent idea from beginning to end, ignoring commerce for the sake of art as if they were the very first people in the history of the world to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss aside a great song just because it didn't fit? Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, anyone who hasheard the Bob Dylan bootlegs or seen how the Beatles came up with their albums know Bruce wasn'tinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's fascinating to see how they had to believe they were to stay passionate andcommitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You really feel like you're in the studio with them, thanks to a lot of footage that shows them bickering and discussing songs, Springsteen spending hours and hours trying to get the right drum sound, the band teasing him by placing bets on what song he was going to take off the album that day or the length of thetracks. (4:45 sounded like a winner.) As Springsteen sits alone discussing those days, he is thoughtful as always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems like the more sincere and earnest he gets, the more likely he is to look down and away, not making eye contact with the interviewer or the camera, as if he's almost afraid to speak that loftilyabout what he was trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a fascinating film, though not one to draw in a lot of newfans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should be enjoyable to anyone but will surely resonate most with those already baptized into the faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second DVD is my favorite. it contains Thrill Hill Vault Houston '78 Bootleg: House Cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a raucous three hour show -- the band had finally been released from purgatory and was out on the road doing what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not in any way a remarkable or stand-out show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's what you probablywould have seen anywhere along the way: three hours of hellaciously entertaining rock and roll by the best live band in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the opener "Badlands" to the don't-you-dare-sit encore featuring a Detroit medley, "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out" and more, it's a delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strangely, Springsteen is a legendary live act but has rarely been caught well on film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It began with the faux live video for "Dancing In the Dark," directed by Brian De Palma, not the most musical of film directors to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Springsteen seemed stiff and fake, the utter opposite of him in real life on stage.The boxed set Live 1971-1985 was great, but that was audio only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every time he's done a concert film, like the one in New York or the one in Dublin (or Barcelona or London), it's been a relentlessly tiresomebarrage of cut-cut-cuts to create excitement in the editing when the last thing a Springsteen show needsis help to generate power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Give any director today 15 cameras and by god, he's going to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the curse of most concert films, though exceptions like Stop Making Sense by the Talking Heads prove it still can be done with artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not for Springsteen, who is whipsawed from camera to camera. 1 of 5 Michael R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomberg On the Tragic Shootings in Arizona Michael Smerconish Thoughts on YesterdayDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS drew carey lost 85 pounds john goodman lost 100 pounds miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant More Celebrity News at People.com Olbermann: 'Put The Gun Metaphors Away' Like 10K Jake Gyllenhaal Praises (and Teases) Pregnant Natalie Portman READ MORE Neil Patrick Harris Is Smitten With Twins' Smiles READ MORE Report: Las VegasShowgirl's Body Was Dismembered READ MORE Phaedra Parks Chats With PopEater Joan and Melissa Rivers Retire From Red Carpet Victoria Beckham Expecting Baby No. 4 Happily, this relatively primitive recording in 1978 only had a few cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And though the director cuts between them far more than say the artistry on display in The Last Waltz or Jazz On A Summer's Day, they're a lot more likely to stay with a song and not feel the need to exploit eight different angles on every single tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So this is much, much closer to the experience of sitting in the audience and seeing his showin person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The image stays still long enough to let the performers create the moment, not the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a treat and easily the best Springsteen concert film I've seen to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final DVD has a grab-bag of stuff, some of it also sensational for hardcore fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first batch is called Thrill Hill Vault 1976-1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins with two rehearsals in someone's house in Holmdel, New Jersey in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Springsteen is shirtless and swaggering, having fun as they work through the songs "Save My Love" and "Candy's Boy" (an early version of "Candy's Room") and then another tune -- "SomethingIn The Night" at Red Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You literally feel like you're hanging out with the guys, watching them work their way towards greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whoever is shooting the footage just has one camera, thank God, so they stay focused on one person at a time, maybe panning from Steven Van Zandt back to Bruce is as fancy as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fly on the wall stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then comes four songs recorded live in the studio in New York City in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've no idea what happened on the first number, "Don't Look Back." It's utterly different than the rest, filled with all sorts of cuts and edits, like any mishmash number recorded today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe they just cut together a bunch of footage from the session and kept the audio track to make it all seem to be happening at the same moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's of course far less satisfying emotionally and artistically than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The heart-stopping moment here is getting to watch Springsteen sit at the piano and play "Candy's Room" as he works through the lyrics and gives the others a sense of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like getting to watch Lennon and McCartney sit down with anacoustic guitar and audition their latest tunes for George Martin. (If only such footage existed.)Otherwise, it's just one camera, which in one song moves from musician to musician just as if you were in the room looking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Artless, simple and again, much more fun than any concert he's recorded in the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we get five songs from a Phoenix show in 1978 that produced the footage (I believe) for the music video MTV ran over and over for "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)." It's a well-light, raucous show and whilethe editing is getting a little more fast-paced it's not out of control quite yet Finally, we get a 2009 performance of the entire Darkness On The Edge Of Town album in order at the Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the documentary film, it's directed by Thom Zimny, but here he squanders a golden opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a rehearsal of sorts -- just the band performing the album without an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're focused and tight and ready to prove the album and the band areboth as relevant and fiery as ever -- Springsteen wanted music that was rebellious but ready to own up to its responsibilities, which is one reason it carries such conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was meant to be played by adults and it shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But of course, this being today, instead of a few well-placed cameras or cinematographers encouraged to find a great angle and stick with it, all we get is cut-cut-cut throughout the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The edits are so absurd both musically and emotionally it'll drive you nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They cut in the middle of lines, sometimes even in themiddle of a word or phrase and for no apparent purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since there's no audience, Zimny was presumably even freer to place cameras anywhere he wanted without fear of blocking the sight line of a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They could have been as close and intimate as they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you'd be hard-pressed to see anyvisual difference between this and any other concert film done with an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band sounds great of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But oh, what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any time I think of Springsteen on film, I think of the No Nukes concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Springsteen is on stage and right behind him is this red spotlight that bleeds out all around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's one camera and it's focused tight on him as he begins to tell the story of "The River" and then sing that brilliant song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Springsteen isrooted to the spot but when he moves just a little to the left or the right, that red light fills up the screen so you can barely see him at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the camera stays right there and the director doesn't cut away for the longest time and it's one of the most magnetic things you'll ever see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's out of character for Springsteen to not have released the remastered Darkness CD on its own already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not even scheduled for release that I can see, when at most there should have been maybe a week or two when only the people who could shell out for the entire box got the album as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now you canbuy the two CD set of The Promise, which is like a great lost Springsteen album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And presumably at some point soon you'll be able to get the Darkness CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for hardcore fans, the three DVDs contain a wealthof material they'll soak up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And anyone wondering how to capture a great artist on film can learn a lot byseeing how much more gripping and involving it is to simply let the artist perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Debit...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joke... probably because it wasn't filmed, but the "winterlan d" show (dec. 15, '78) would have made this box an even greater holiday treat. the west coast radio simulcast produced by jimmy iovine is probably the greatest live recording ever made, bootleg or otherwise. i saw five shows on the darkness tour and none of that recording strife was shown...wh en e-street hit the stage it was nothing but fun. if it wore them out any putting darkness together, it was payback time by wearing the audience out...and they proved it all night, every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mine just came today with a t-shirt and poster.Can 't wait to go home and indulge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw him on this tour in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite an astounding collection .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMO, Darkness is Springstee n's most enduring album (and most relevant to current times), and it's great to see the burst of creativity that accompanie d that album more fully documented in this set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotta note though that the Houston concert has its own moments of cinematic cheese, with the overlappin g video transition s and Wayne's Worldesque back-forth camera zooming that give away its late-70s origins (IMO, this is a lot more annoying than the quick-cut editing that prevails today).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great though that we get a complete concert from the Darkness tour, which is really when the E Street Band started to find their voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The playing is focused and forceful, but still loose and raw.The band is not as tentative as the 1975 Hammersmit h Odeon concert that accompanie d the Born to Run boxset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This set includes 35 minutes of footage from that concert, and I wonder why that the Houston show was chosen over the Phoenix concert. (Bootlegs of the Phoenix show have been circulatin g for years, so the footage exists somewhere) For one thing, the Phoenix concert was recorded using film cameras, which show much higher resolution than the primitive video cameras used to shoot the Houston concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is especiallyapparent on Blu-ray, which shows the Promise documentar y, closed rehearsal, and other filmed footage in their high def glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently , due to the expense involved, only those five songs were filmed and not the entire concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still impossible to believe that the music on "Born to Run" earned him the front cover of TIME andNewsweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunat ely says far more about the magazines' proclivity for sensationa lism than it does about the greatness of Springstee n's music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the next 7 or so years would bear out, the Boss could not measure up with phenomenal music emanating from the various pop genres of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many stadiums have those people who were making the "phenomena l music emanating from the various pop genres of time" sold out lately? Are any of them even selling out little clubs in strip malls in Podunk? "Factory", "Backstree ts", "Racing In The Street" &amp; "Stolen Car" are my favorite Bruce songs (this will, of course change tomorrow) Thanks for a great review, and thank you for the critique of how the usual concert is filmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember when I was a mere lad, learning to play guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was really trying hard to get my leadtechnique, but had hit an impasse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I believe I was watching the old Merv Griffin show with BB Kingas guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As luck would have it, the director kept the camera dead-on BB's left hand for quiteawhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeing what he was doing was an epiphany! In the time it took Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King to play "The Thrill Is Gone", I was on my way to guitar heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, music was presented better on TV then than now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why show someone playing drums or keyboard or worse yet a pimply-fac ed teen gawking at the stage when someone is playing a burning lead, or singing their heart out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Show the performanc e, for god's sake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, I don't mind seeing the audience (some of the McCartney DVD's use that technique really well.) But we all don't have ADD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Show the player, playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it Estreet1964 05:38 PM on 11/23/2010 Permalink | Share it RobBlack 04:21 PM on 11/22/2010 Permalink | Share it Estreet1964 05:37 PM on 11/23/2010 Permalink | Share it argentino 11:07 AM on 11/22/2010 Permalink | Share it ktano0 04:35 PM on 11/21/2010 Permalink | Share it KayoFrisco 01:32 PM on 11/21/201059 Fans 81 Fans 8 Fans Follow 289 Fans 1 FansMy first Bruce concert was 12/16/78 at Winterland , the night "Fire" was recorded for the 1975-1985 Box Set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was about a week after the Houston show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeing The Boss on my home town stage where I saw many other greats was unbelievab le.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had never before or since seen an artist with as much energy, and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people first thoughtthe show was so good that it was over after the first set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were surprised to hear him say he would be back to "drive us insane", and he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I became a raving fan that night and tried to convince others who had not yet seen him that Brucewas for real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scales fell from my eyes on that old balcony when I saw the true savior of Rockand Roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That final month at Winterland I also saw Van Morrison, The Tubes and The Ramones,plus the last night with The Grateful Dead, The Blues Brothers, and "breakfast served at dawn".That Bruce concert stands out as a memory I cherish for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a lineup of artists to see in a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't get any better than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanksfor sharing your memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a bootleg videotape of the 1978 Phoenix concert, portions of which are on the third DVD ofthis package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great that finally, footage from some of those concerts of the "Darkness" tour isgetting to see the light of day legally! I practicall y wore out my videotape watching the concert! I don't have a problem with the covers of "Fire" and "Because the Night" by the Pointer Sisters and Patti Smith, respective ly; their interpreta tions of those songs are classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I never have liked Manfred Mann's cover of "Blinded by the Light", and when it comes on the oldies station, I hit the "change" button! (Apologies to any Manfred Mann fans out there!) I bought this and it is a brilliant box set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great packaging with the only negative I have of it is that it's difficult to put the notebook back into its case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contents in both the DVDs and the CDsare above par with some of the stuff that other musicians are doing with their box sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's 100%worth the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also have to point out that while I like Darkness, his magnum opus, Born to Run,did not receive as great packaging for it's reissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I just wish that Springstee n can go back in time and redo his Born to Run and make it as superior as this box set "Born to Run, did not receive as great packaging" Probably because it wasn't released for Xmas product reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really? Born to Run: 30th Anniversar y Edition release date: November 14, 2005 The Promise: The Making of Darkness On The Edge of Town release date: November 16, 2010 So, something released on November 14th does not have the same "Xmas product reasons" as something released two days after?

"the Houston concert"Yes but the rest isn't worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having fun with your pot stirring? I just figured you out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sad, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All The concert itself is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can really sense the ascension of the E Street Band in this full length concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The review though doesn't make note of the spotty picture quality (typical of anything shot on video tape during the 70s), which has a lot of ghosting and visible scan lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thereview also gripes about the quick-cut editing of today's concert videos, but doesn't mentionsome of the cheesy oh-so-70s video effects (again, typical of concert footage shot duringthat period) used in the Houston footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As noted earlier, I just wonder why the Phoenix concert wasn't used instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boxset includes 35 minutes from that concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMO, the Phoenix performanc es, audio mix, and editing are better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the Phoenix concert was shot on film, so it looks a lot better on Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, I did call it "primitive " at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly a tip-off that this isn't the Rolling Stones in IMAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree that the artistry isn't high on the film, just thatgiven the time they did less cutting and crazy effects and given the fewer camerasthey just didn't have the ability to go crazy like they would today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is arelatively better experience , but as you say it's certainly not high fidelity or a great picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Phoenix footage does look great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reason they didn't use it is theusual blinkered mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it comes to live recordings of Bruce, their record ofwhat to release and when has been absurd for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it JasonM 01:55 PM on 11/20/2010 Permalink | Share it sufi66 02:55 PM on 11/20/2010 Permalink | Share it theothersideofsilence 09:58 AM on 11/22/2010 Permalink | Share it Woochifer 05:30 PM on 11/22/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 06:24 PM on 11/22/2010 Permalink | Share it FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.</p>
