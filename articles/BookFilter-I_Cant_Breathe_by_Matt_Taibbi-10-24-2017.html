He's also covered politics, inequality and other issues with similarly lacerating prose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he's turned to the incendiary case of Eric Garner,the man choked to death by New York City policemen, gasping "I can't breathe" as they slowly squeezed the life out of himand all of it caught on video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While only a full trial offering the proper context for evidence and events not captured on camera might be necessary to determine guilt in a court of law, the fact that the case didn't even draw an indictment for the cops involved proved a worldwide scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here comes Taibbi, presumably breathing fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what do we get? Asober, nuanced, devastating critique that is all the more powerful for being so damned straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each of the book'ssixteen chapters is given the name of a person who plays a central role beginning with Ibrahim -- a man blindsided by avicious attack from the police when sitting in his own car on private property -- to Erica, the daughter of Eric Garner who found herself thrust into the public spotlight when seeking justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi covers the origins of NYC's Broken Windows policy and how it was always vulnerable to prejudice, the long history of mistreatment of black people by the police, thedemeaning Stop And Frisk program, the court system in New York and especially Staten Island, the history of activism and AlSharpton, the missteps of Mayor Bill De Blasio and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet above all, it creates a deft and compelling portrait of Eric Garner, a man who was liked by all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That sounds like a bromide, but Taibbi does Garner the honor of not sanctifying the man -- he has no problem accepting and illustrating the complexity of a person who was a one-time drug dealer,estranged at times from his children, familiar with prison and yet also obsessively determined to provide for his kids aheadof himself, keeping the peace in the park where he worked so hard day and night to make a little money (all of which went to his family) and ultimately doomed by a world in which he was deemed suspicious just for being alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi is by no means holding back here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He ends with an impassioned recognition that yes, this is about race -- yet again and always --and what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By recognizing the flaws in everyone from the mayor to the court system to Al Sharpton to thepolice union head Pat Lynch (who is almost ALL flaws) to Garner himself, Taibbi has done justice to a tragedy that lacked it long before Garner gasped his last breath. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Advance praise for I Can’t Breathe “A complex and textured examination of the complicated personalities, flawed legal system, and politics revolving around the police killing of forty-three-year-old Eric Garner, whosefinal words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.”—Boston Globe, “Must Read Books forthe Fall” “[A] brilliant work of narrative nonfiction . . . [Matt] Taibbi is unsparing is his excoriation of thesystem, police, and courts that led to the fatal choke hold and worked to blur the abuse afterward. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a necessary and riveting work.”—Booklist, starred review “[A] searing exposé . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After deeply exploring Garner’s life from a variety of perspectives, Taibbi offers detailed reporting about the out-of-control Staten Island policeofficers present at the death scene . . . [and] the futile efforts of the Garner family to achieve posthumousjustice. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What emerges from the author’s superb reporting and vivid writing is a tragically revealing look at abroken criminal justice system geared to serve white citizens while often overlooking or ignoring the rights ofothers.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “Richly reported and evocative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Taibbi is not shy about hispoint of view, he keeps the narrative nuanced and realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is unafraid of the less charitable aspects ofGarner, and he’s diligent and agnostic when it comes to detailing his world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi is the rare partisan whounderstands that, even as he makes his case, he need not pretend that the world is a simple place, and that thebest way to grapple with its complexities is to let facts speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result here is a vivid folk history that should prove useful to anyone who seeks to understand the world Eric Garner inhabited, not just progressives.”—Jill Leovy, bestselling author of Ghettoside “Matt Taibbi’s I Can’t Breathe marries the bestinstincts of explanatory narrative journalism with uncompromising moral clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a riveting walkthrough decades of policing policy and big city politics that culminated, seemingly inevitably, in Eric Garner’skilling by the New York Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While he may have set out to document a fatal injustice, the taleTaibbi tells is not one of a death, but one of a life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In capturing the fullness of Garner’s ‘imperfect humanity,’ ICan’t Breathe adds a vital account of police violence and a vivid exploration of its lingering costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi,through thorough reporting and captivating writing, captures the totality of an American tragedy.”—WesleyLowery, Pulitzer Prize–winning national correspondent for The Washington Post and author of the New YorkTimes bestselling They Can’t Kill Us All: Ferguson, Baltimore and a New Era in America's Racial Justice Movement What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
