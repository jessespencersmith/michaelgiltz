The Borgias! Horses! Murder! And More!THE STRANGER IN THE WOODS by Michael Finkel It’s not every day that that a book comes along that deserves a permanent place in your library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is such a book, not only for the detailed way it documents the remarkable survival of Christopher Knight, whospent over twenty-seven years alone in the woods of Maine, but for its advocacy and respect for those who respond differently to modern civilization and its noises, its crowding, its sensual overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At age 20, after a road trip to Florida, Knight suddenly was seized by a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Returning to where he grew up in rural Maine, he abandoned his car and ventured into the woods, knowing he would never return willingly to civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just a few miles from his childhood home and often within hearing distance of fishermen and summer tourists -- whose homes he burglarized more than one thousand times for food and fuel as well asany books and magazines left behind -- Knight eventually found the perfect spot, a clearing bordered by dense hemlocks on one side and large boulders with a hidden entrance on the other....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Biography? We've Got 24 More Lives For You To Dive Into! *************** IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY by Sarah Dunant Ruthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decadent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's not to love about the Borgias, Italy's first family of politics? Acclaimed author Sarah Dunant continues their story, charting the family's decline as seen through the eyes of Machiavelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, declines for most but not perhaps for Lucrezia, 22 years old, thrice-married and tired of being her father's pawn....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Fiction? We've got 36 New Releases Ready For Browsing! *************** THE INHERITANCE by Niki CapsambelisThis work of popular science tells two interlinked stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the one hand, it looks at scientists racing to discover a cure for Alzheimer's, a disease attacking an increasing number of people now that we live longer and longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, it humanizes that fight by looking at the DeMoe family, people genetically cursed with a propensity for early onset Alzheimer's to a terrible degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of six children in this one family, five have it and the sixth is their de facto care giver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They agree to tell their story and be the subjects of endless testing, sacrifice what little life they have left to help others in the future....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Science? Learn About the Great Lakes, Fighting Zika, Eclipses &amp; More in 24 New Books!***************GOODBYE, PAULA FOX Novelist Paula Fox died last week at the age of 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a typically evocative and perceptive New York Times obituary by Margalit Fox (no relation), she points out that Fox was the rare writer who had penned books people could read from birth to death, including picture books and middle grade books and fiction and memoirs, all of it acclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The autobiography Borrowed Finery was a late career capper for the woman who would die at 93, a nice final act in a life that began so disastrously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the obituary states in a style the writer herself would have admired, "Paula Fox was born in Manhattan on April 22, 1923 to parents who did not want her." Her relative obscurity in recent years changed when author Jonathan Franzen became obsessed with Fox's brilliant novel about a dissolving marriage -- Desperate Characters -- and talked it up to one and all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no better way to celebrate a person's life than to delve into what they created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So check out Desperate Characters and her other books right away. *************** ILL WILL by Dan Chaon This is not for the fainthearted. "Ill Will" combines a violent murder set in the past with the chilling revelation of a serial killer stalking young college men in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no super detective or dedicated FBI agent who will save the day in either case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no relief from this novel’s remorse or psychological rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And retribution will have its way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, ill will stalks the novel’s characters like a cold fog seeping into every corner of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its probing character insight and its expansive analysis of how we think about crime, this is a true novel with an American crime landscape, from the plains of Nebraska to the strip malls of suburban Ohio to the farmhouses of Oregon....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Thrillers &amp; Mysteries? We've Got 28 New Crimes For You To Crack! ***************MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DARLEY'S ARABIAN by Christopher McGrath This is a history about the sport of kings -- horse racing -- as told through the bloodlines of 25 horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But like Seabiscuit , critics say this entertaining work is so filled with memorable characters and details of the distant times in which these champions competed that even those who've never clutched a ticket stub and cheered on a filly will be enthralled....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Sports? We've Got 12 Winners Waiting For You! Love History? Explore The Past By Scrolling Through 24 New Books! *************** THE KINGDOM by Emmanuel CarrèreCheered on by the New York Times Magazine with a glowing profile, author Emmanuel Carrère is a unique writer and that's never been clearer than in this new "novel." It combines history, memoir, journalims, an exploration of faith and fiction to tell the story of the early Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrère especially brings to life the saints Paul (vehement enemy turned even more ardent convert) and Luke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may make you a believer...of Carrère, at least....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Fiction? We've got 36 Books For You To Escape Into!*************** MY MASTER RECIPES by Patricia WellsShe may not be a TV icon, but if anyone is following in the hallowed footsteps of Julia Child, it may well be Patricia Wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her accomplishments -- four James Beard awards, honors from the French government, the only foreigner and only woman to write restaurant reviews for a major French outlet -- are many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Wells provides a capper -- a definitive collection of recipes offered in her cooking classes that form the basis for both a chef's skills and endless possibilities for variation....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Cookbooks, Food &amp; Drink? We've 16 Delicious Choices For You To Nibble On! ***************WE LOVE LIBRARIES! On March 12, 1901, i ndustrialist Andrew Carnegie donated more than $5 million to help fund the construction of 65 branch libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was just the first of many such ventures, for the steel tycoon made $250 million in one fell swoop and spent the rest of his life giving it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, he founded more than 2,500 libraries around the world, along with various trusts and Carnegie Mellon University! If you love libraries as much as Carnegie, check out the American Library Association's website I Love Libraries to see how you can support them, volunteer and generally cheer on your local library. *************** WHEN JACKIE SAVED GRAND CENTRAL by Natasha Wing and Alexander Boiger New York's Grand Central Station is threatened by developers and Jackie Kennedy springs into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Court battles and media-friendly train trips to drum up support follow in quick succession right up to the triumphant if poignant restoration of Grand Central to its glory in 1998...four years after Jackie died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wing crams in a lot of information, but it's the snappy illustrations by Boiger that will entice the young and old, from the black and white flashback prelude at the White House to the gorgeous ceiling of the Great Hall itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlights include Jackie staring fondly at her younger self playing in Central Park; a quick nod to Andy Warhol; Jackie handwriting a letter with her famous sunglasses on the table beside her and especially Jackie striding back and forth in front of the Supreme Court waiting for a decision, her stick legs embodying motion and purpose and her glamorous silhouette all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really for your adult friends or fans of Jackie, unless you've got a kid who is really into history or architecture....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Picture Books? You'll Find Eight Great Ones Along With More Books For Kids For You To Play With! ***************HAVANA by Mark Kurlansky With the US opening the way to Cuba -- however briefly -- the timing is perfect for this unassuming but charming work about Havana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer Mark Kurlansky has been visiting Cuba for decades and this casual, discursive book rambles easily from history to observation to recipe to portraits of locals and back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's only later that you'll realize how much you've been able to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfect for anyone headed there or simply wishing to learn more about a city and country cloaked in romance and mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kurlansky doesn't dispel that -- who would want him to? -- but it's revealing nonetheless....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Travel? All You Need Is A Chair, Some Time &amp; One Of Eight New Picks! Love History? We've Got 22 Books Bursting With True Adventure!*************** HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN? by P.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Rourke Oh, the election seemed very funny at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Humorist and political observer P.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Rourke had a front row seat during the 2016 Presidential election and he chronicled everything from the clown car of Republican nominees to his own rather hilarious "Come To Satan" moment when the iconoclastic writer decided to support Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then there was the electoral college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How the hell did this happen? Maybe O'Rourke can't definitively explain it all, but he can sure make you laugh while trying....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Current Events?
