Even if you've never seen it, you've seen clips from the film or at least parodies of the film -- just its name alone will start the stirring strains of "Also Sprach Zarathrustra" ringing in your ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a landmark film that still stuns with its special effects (all hail hand-craftedmodels over the purely digital!) and utterly confuses the literal-minded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a kid, I had to read the novelization by ArthurC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clarke to grasp what the hell was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've caught up to the film's elliptical nature, so it may not be quite as confounding today for a new viewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you haven't watched it yet, you must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And once you do, you may well become obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you do get obsessed, you might want to read Michael Benson's thorough coverage about the making of thisfilm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's strictly for fans of Kubrick and/or the film itself -- all but ardent admirers will be bored during early passagesabout what was shot when and how and by whom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benson speaks to many participants and creates good drama out of hismaterial, but it doesn't come quite to life on its own terms as a story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet if you care about filmmaking, you'll discover fascinating information about the endless creativity on display, how a brilliant director can frustrate and inspire everyone around him and the improvisation that is inherent in even the most meticulously planned production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Kubrick was asprepared and painstaking as possible, a film with no finished script is hardly one destined for a casual shoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was surprisedto hear how this director noted for his controlling image was hugely open to ideas, the way he thrust responsibility on newbies with little to no track record and -- after all that -- how petty he could be about giving credit where credit was due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all here (to a fault), from the first meeting of Kubrick and a too-trusting Arthur C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clarke to the disastrous openingnight premiere and the film's rather quick rebirth as both a critical and popular hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone cherished their link to thisclassic -- well, not everyone, since there were a surprising number of casualties both professionally and health-wise -- andwho could blame them? How often do you get to be part of an adventure like this? I recommend the movie wholeheartedly -- and if you feel nonplussed or bored or just bewildered, welcome to the club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you become entranced -- like me and so many others -- you should tackle this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never read a Kubrick bio or other earlier tales about the making of the film,but on its own this certainly leaves no stone (or monolith) unturned. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúAt last! The dense, intense, detailed, and authoritative saga of the making of the greatest motion picture I‚Äôve ever seen, 2001: A Space Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I now have reason to see Kubrick‚Äôs ‚Äòproverbial ‚Äúreally good‚Äù science fictionmovie‚Äô another 200 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Benson has done the Cosmos a great service.‚Äù (Tom Hanks) "Over the years,so much has been written about 2001 and its creation that I thought we knew all that there was to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthen, I received a copy of Michael Benson‚Äôs lively, exciting and exhaustively researched book, which further expands our understanding of what is truly one of the greatest films ever made." (Martin Scorsese) ‚ÄúMichael Benson‚Äôs Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece is a masterpieceabout a masterpiece‚Äîa passionately written, impeccably researched book about a great director‚Äôs pushinghimself, his cast and crew beyond safety or sanity in a relentless quest for a non-verbal vision of thetranscendent future of both space and film itself.‚Äù (Scott Eyman, author of John Wayne: The Life and Legendand Hank and Jim: The Fifty-Year Friendship of Henry Fonda and James Stewart) ‚ÄúDespite the attention Bensonlavishes on the humans‚ÄîKubrick and Clarke‚ÄîHAL-9000 would have been proud of this smart, fluent, andmeticulously researched account of the making of a sci-fi classic.‚Äù (Peter Biskind, author of Easy Riders, RagingBulls: How the Sex, Drugs, and Rock 'n' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood) ‚ÄúA fascinating, detail-rich account ofthe long slog to make the science-fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey. . . . [An] endlessly interesting narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essential for students of film history, to say nothing of Kubrick's most successful movie.‚Äù (Kirkus Reviews (starred review)) ‚ÄúIf Kubrick‚Äôs masterpiece was a remarkable voyage into the future, Michael Benson‚Äôsbook is a delightful voyage back in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For those of us inspired by the film, this book provides a delicious peekinto landmark collaboration of two creative geniuses and the lasting gift they provided for all of us.‚Äù (LawrenceM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Krauss, Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, Director of the Origins Project atArizona State University, and author of The Physics of Star Trek, A Universe from Nothing, and The GreatestStory Ever Told..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Far) What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
