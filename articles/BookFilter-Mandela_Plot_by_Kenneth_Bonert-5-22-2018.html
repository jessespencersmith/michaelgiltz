YoungMartin Helger is the struggling odd duck at an elite private boys school in Johannesburg, with his father a rough-handed scrap dealer and his brother a mysterious legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a beautiful and manipulative American arrivesat the family home, Martin soon finds himself wrenched out of his isolatedbubble and thrust into the raw heart of the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time,secrets from the past begin to emerge and old sins long buried return in terrifying new ways, tearing at the Helgers, a second-generation Jewish family, even as the larger forces of history and politics tear apart thecountry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mercy is in short supply and ultimately Martin mustrely on alternative strengths to protect himself and fight for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the acclaimed author of the National Jewish Book Award‚Äì winning debut novel The Lion Seeker, The Mandela Plot is at once a riveting literary thriller, a moving coming of age tale, and anunforgettable journey through a world that entertains and terrifies inequal measure, and holds profound resonance for the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

What We Say Kenneth Bonert's second novel has a setting of time and place that's so weighty it can feel crushing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero Martin is a Jewish teenager growing up in apartheid South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His family has just enough money to send him to an elite privateschool for Jews, but not quite enough money to make him accepted there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin's father is decent to his black workers, but not enough to avoid the threat of unions and radicals or the unwitting stain of his paternalistic attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boy'sShare This Book About The Author Kenneth Bonert KENNETH BONERT's first novel, The Lion Seeker , won the National Jewish Book Award, the Edward Lewis Wallant Award, and the Canadian Jewish Book Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonert was also a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize and the Governor General‚Äôs Literary Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was born in South Africa and now lives in Toronto, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $27.00 (Hardcover) Published: May 22, 2018 Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Pages: 480 ISBN 10: 1328886182 ISBN 13: 9781328886187brother is a hard case who turned his back on the safety of university and essentially volunteered for the military at a time when it was engaged in deeply oppressive and brutal battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And really all Martin wants to do is get closer to the new white American college student staying with them -- pity she turns out to be an activist teaching blacks at a school in the townships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From random violence to anti-Semitism to the disdain of his "betters," Martin simply can't get a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His worldreally is filled with landmines -- both literal and figurative -- and every choice he makes is rife with moral complexity.Bonert captures the claustrophobic, dangerous atmosphere of the time with impressive weight; honestly, Martin's optionswere all poor and you felt dreadful for him, even as he did things that made you like him less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The darkness closes in and Martin's grasp on reality becomes unmoored and this book melted down in impressive fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a pity to report that the book becomes too cinematic in the final act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bigger in scope it reached for, the less convincing it proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin is avery memorable character and for a while the poisonous environment seeped off the page in impressive fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That willlinger long after the fireworks of the finale fizzled out. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say A Publisher‚Äôs Lunch ‚ÄúEmerging Voice‚Äù A New York Post "Must-Read Book" "This is fiction that illuminates shifting allegiances and power struggles during a dark time and place in recenthistory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A riveting thriller with a solid historical base."‚ÄîBooklist , Starred Review "The Mandela Plot is as suspenseful as a thriller, and the truest kind of Jewish family story‚Äîsuffused with love and secrets both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also a masterful, terrifying portrait of a nation, at once bewitching and brutal, whose years on the edge have so much to teach America, and the world, today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't be able to put this book down." ‚ÄîBoris Fishman, author of A Replacement Life and Don‚Äôt Let My Baby Do Rodeo ‚ÄúPropulsive, bare-boned, and riveting, The Mandela Plot shows how competing loyalties to family, truth, and history can tear a person‚Äîand a country‚Äîapart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kenneth Bonert‚Äôs unvarnished characters are fierce andsurprising‚Äîthere are no seat belts on this ride.‚Äù ‚ÄîRachel Kadish, author of The Weight of Ink ‚ÄúChaim Potok meets Leon Uris: a solid [‚Ä¶] portrait of violence and renewal.‚Äù ‚ÄîKirkus Reviews "It‚Äôs the late 1980s in South Africa, where an awkward boy named Martin struggles to find a place at an elite private school in Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
