The festival itself is especially civilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a critic, you feel none of the tension and pressure at NYFF that you might at other, larger festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a way, it's a film festival for people who can't go to film festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theycherry pick movies that have appeared at other fests around the world and offer them to savvy New Yorkers, the very audience that would seek out these movies at independent cinemas if and when they got a theatrical run (as many of the films here do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a relaxed, ideal way to end the festival circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for movie buffs, it's a good way to check the pulse of world cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CARNAGE ** 1/2 out of **** Playwright Yazmina Reza specializes in boulevard comedies -- well-constructed plays with small casts and strong roles that appeal to top actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her most successful works are Art (a clever piece in which three friends bicker over one of their purchases in modern art) and now Gods Of Carnage, shortened for film to just Carnage .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're easy to over-praise and just as easy to under-praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The glimmers of debate about deep and meaningful topics -- What is art? How do you raise children? How close are we to chaos? The importance of language -- annoy those who see her works as just slightly above sitcom level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But FOLLOW US 'Titanic' Trailer!
