                <p>DVDs: Get Ready For The Doctor! DoctorWho? Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A big roundup of some of the best TV sets released in the last few weeks, ranging from classic miniseries and ground-breaking sitcoms to the hottest show on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butlet's start with the Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOCTOR WHO: THE DOCTORS REVISITED ($39.99 DVD; BBC) DOCTOR WHO: THE GREEN DEATH ($34.99 DVD; BBC) DOCTOR WHO: SPEARHEAD FROM SPACE ($29.99 BluRay; BBC) THE THICK OF IT ($79.99 DVD; BBC) -- We can stop explaining who the Doctor is, can't we? Now America has finally caught up with the decades-long career of the TARDIS-traveling Time Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The budgets are bigger, many of his adventuressuspiciously occur on Earth but the Doctor is rightfully celebrated here as the iconicTV figure he's been in the UK for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And none too soon: a lot is happening in theworld of the Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a 50th anniversary special taking place in November withMay 13, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 08/29/2013 12:16 amJohn Hurt portraying some incarnation of the Doctor alongside current lead Matt Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Smith says goodbye during the Christmas special with Peter Capaldi taking over for the next batch of shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you do need catching up, there's no better place to start then one of the Doctors Revisited sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one covers four doctors in nice retrospective fashion (including my first Doctor, Tom Baker) along with a complete adventure for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At just $40 list, that's an absolute bargain for newbies since just one complete adventure -- such as Jon Pertwee's The Green Death -- usually runs $35 at list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Granted, this edition comes loaded with all sorts of extras, an almost overwhelming amount of detail and bonus videos literally too numerous to mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just to confuse you, the Doctor is finally coming out on BluRay, beginning with Pertwee's Spearhead From Space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes sense since this classic tale (also included on the Doctor Revisited omnibus DVD) was the first one shot in color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why is this confusing? Because they're only charging $30 list for the BluRay compared to $35 for DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Okay, let me say this again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I LOVE the Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't care how many extras they cram onto the discs, these sets are wildly overpriced and woefully skimpy on actualshows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are they really going to release 50 years of episodes on BluRay, withindividual but expensive releases for every single adventure? (An adventure in the olddays usually lasted in a three or four episode arc.) This is soaking of loyal fans in away that the Doctor himself would be ashamed to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone take a sonicscrewdriver and fix this mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Massive individual and definitive boxed sets for eachDoctor -- and when the limited editions sell out, less expensively packaged copies ofthe same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a greatest hits set for each Doctor of their best few adventures (moreor less depending on how long they played the role).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then INEXPENSIVE sets foreach season of each Doctor if you think there's demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But really complete sets foreach one should suffice. (Only Tom Baker ran for a daunting seven seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restusually ran for three or four.) The massive markup of episodes that aired decades agois not smart on a business level -- how many fans will actually bother to buy all of them -- or on a franchise level, since it keeps so many people from dipping into the history of the Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the love of God, stop the madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enough ranting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's get fanboyish again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Capaldi is the next very traditional choice -- a more mature man as most Doctors were, rather than a person of color or awoman as some expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's a strong though little known actor to most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckyyou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get to check out his earlier work in the terrific series The Thick Of It.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This scathing political comedy is the best of its kind since Yes, Minister, another British import.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first four seasons of The West Wing are great but I'll take the biting wit on display here over the inspirational tale that is The West Wing any day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess I just prefer reality to fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE WALKING DEAD COMPLETE THIRDSEASON ($79.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay) -- In three seasons, The Walking Dead has gone from guilty pleasure to very good drama togreat drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look no further than the brilliantstand-alone episode "Clear," in which SheriffRick, his increasingly troubled son Carl andthe fierce Michonne go on a road trip to get weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a haunting touch involving a would-be hitchhiker, the show neatlycaptures the moral complexity of their worldwithout saying a single word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a searingexample of what it costs to survive andwhether surviving is worthwhile if you've lostyour soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the heart of the series andthey explore the question with remarkablepersistence and engaging storytelling thatupsets and confounds and challenges you atevery turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's gory as all get out butThe Walking Dead is serious television any fan of quality drama needs to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEMANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS THE COMPLETE SERIES ($139.99 DVD; Shout) - - Shout has firmly established itself as a source of great boxed sets like this -- offbeat movies and TV shows that might otherwise slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the sort of stuffthat Rhino once rescued on CD from the music vaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Many Loves Of DobieGillis is by no means a great show or a cult classic, but is genuinely odd and ground- breaking in a quiet sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what casting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genuine beats must have beenhorrified to see themselves parodied so quickly on TV (the show began in 1959) butBob Denver would never have a better part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what casting? After Denver (who ofcourse earned eternal fame on Gilligan's Island), the first season featured never to bebeat cast-members like the luminous Tuesday Weld as his love interest and Warren Beatty as his rival. (Dobie doesn't stand a chance.) Dobie's frank desire for girls, girls, girls and Weld's just as frank desire for money, money, money feels modern, along with the show's breaking of the fourth wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even better, they avoid the foolishness of having adults play high school students by rushing Dobie and his beatnik pal into theArmy and finally college in the second and third seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's never quite as good asyou want it to be but it's not nearly as mindless as many of the shows that followed inthe 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extras are modest, especially for a show with such acomplicated history. (It began as short stories and was then a feature film, spawninganother novel along the way.)GIRLS THE COMPLETESECOND SEASON($39.99 BluRay;HBO)BOARDWALKEMPIRE THIRDSEASON ($79.99 BluRay; HBO)STRIKE BACK SECOND SEASON ($49.99 BluRay; Cinemax/HBO) SHAMELESSSEASONS 1 AND 2($24.99 DVD; MillCreek)MIDSOMERMURDERSSEASON I ($59.99 DVD; Acorn) --When do shows losebuzz? After whathappened to Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil,I'm not about to discuss the date rape/consensual sex issue raised provocatively by Lena Dunhamduring the second season of her singular series Girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I will raise the spectre inthis hurried world that the show has already gone from over-praised to almostforgotten, despite the Emmys and press. (The loss of Christopher Abbott is especiallytroubling.) Both extremes are wrong but that's the problem with buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boardwalk Empire never had it, at least not since it actually debuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's overseen by Martin Scorsese and has great actors from top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Steve Buscemi is not the right actor to hold the center of this show and I don't have a single friend whospeaks about it passionately, even if they do still watch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's handsome and diverting,but far too familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll take the goofy fun of Strike Back on Cinemax any day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can't hate a series with the best tagline in television: "diplomacy is overrated." Tagged the second season on Cinemax, it's actually the third season of the UK series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best action show on TV(the bar is quite low, actually since there aren't many genuine action shows on TV atall), this season revolves around nuclear triggers on the loose in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's 24 without the ticking clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This show deserves a lot more buzz than it's getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You couldn't get more buzzy in the UK than Shameless , the ribald drama created by Paul Abbott that won a BAFTA for Best Drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This blackly humorous look at a very edgy family featured a great cast -- including James McAvoy -- and just wound up its11th and final season this May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was far too long but early on it was raw and veryfunny indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, buzz was never important for Midsomer Murders, the Law &amp; Order of the UK, given how long its run, not its format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This show has been on the air since 1996 and is still very popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of bodies that have piled up in the fictional county ofMidsomer -- populated by a seemingly endless stream of charming villages andvicious killers -- is truly shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its dependable charms are on full display in the firstfive mysteries contained here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes buzz would just get in the way of cozypleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PRIME SUSPECT THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ($119.99 BluRay; Acorn)TALES OF THE CITY 20TH ANNIVERSARYEDITION ($49.99 DVD; Acorn) SMILEY'S PEOPLE ($59.99 BluRay; Acorn) -- Three great collections from Acorn andthey don't get much better than PrimeSuspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helen Mirren's performance as DCI Jane Tennison is rightly hailed as a landmarkin television history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is one of the great anti-heroes in the medium -- indeed, any medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set rightly collects all seven of the miniseries featuring this indelible character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But make no mistake: the first twoare head and shoulders above the others andhead and shoulders above almost anythingelse ever created on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're thatcomplex, brilliantly acted. gripping, movingand flat out exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mature, subtle and anyother adjective you want to throw at them,they are television at their finest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The otherfive mysteries involving Tennison are ofvarying quality, usually solid, sometimes dicey and even less superior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mirren is never less than brilliant and nothing cantake away from the accomplishment of those first two entries in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tales Of The City -- a miniseries revolving around gay, lesbian, straight, transgender and other denizens of San Francisco -- was about as unlikely a source of a popular miniseries as you can imagine, despite the wide appeal of Armistead Maupin's novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sexy fun is sexy fun and this soapy charmer had a great cast and great spirit of openness and joy that made it far more than a romp for a narrow audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thenovels hold up better, I think, but this is still a major work and a clear inspiration forDesperate Housewives and their ilk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was gobsmacked when John Le Carre's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was turned into a brilliant film starring Gary Oldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never mind it had to compete with Alec Guinnessand his marvelous work in the award-winning miniseries that preceded it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just didn'tthink that twisty tale could be condensed down into a two hour film and still makesense while remotely resembling the source material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I somehow doubt they couldpull off the same trick with the even denser sequel Smiley's People, which is even more subtle and...dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guinness remained wonderfully impenetrable in the BBCminiseries, with the slightest widening of his eyes or pause in his speech speakingvolumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's great but if you haven't read the book or at the very least pay theutmost attention, I can't imagine you'd have a clue as to what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STAR TREK THENEXTGENERATION SEASON FOUR ($129.99 BluRay;Paramount)STAR TREK ENTERPRISESEASON TWO($129.99 BluRay;Paramount)ORPHAN BLACKSEASON ONE ($29.99 DVD; BBC) -- Probably the most successful syndicated drama in TV history,Star Trek The Next Generation in some respects surpassed the original series in its acting and sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seasons three and four saw the series at its best, thoughfrankly the failure to follow through on the game-changing aspects of the Borg andtheir threat to Earth left me forever disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans won't be disappointed with theBluRay transfers of season four, which are generally up to par with seasons one andthree. (Season two was a disaster.) I would much prefer they make both the originaland the updated versions of episodes available as an option, since there are anumber of special effects and other tweaks included to bring the fx up to today'sstandards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's fine, but it is always good to know exactly what we were watchingwhen it first aired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Trek Enterprise never quite capitalized on its premise of a prequel to the original Star Trek but somehow survived for four seasons, thanks to foolish fans like me who will watch just about anything with the label Star Trek, though we will spend endless time online critiquing the various ways in which episode so-and-so couldn't possibly work out that way because it contradicts episode such-and-such from Deep SpaceNine or the original series or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only it had ever proved worthy of suchpassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many people are passionate about Orphan Black, a modern tale of intrigue revolving around cloning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I gave up after the second or third episode because as with so many modern shows they make you feel like you have to take notes to follow the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idon't mind complexity but come on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless friend after friend has praised theperformance of lead actress Tatiana Maslany in the dual role of a woman and herclone while the outrage over her shutout at the Emmy nominations was about themost interesting aspect of that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there's not getting around having to catch upwith this before season two begins next spring. ***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiplecombinations, including DVD, Blu-ray, digital download, video on demand, streamingand the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The format listed is the format provided for review, not all the formatsavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is often the most expensive version with the most extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do checkindividual titles for availability in all their various guises and price points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a website that lets you browse for books online the way you do in a physical bookstore, provides comprehensive info on new releases every week inevery category and offers passionate personal recommendations every step of theway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a fall book preview or holiday gift guide -- but every week in everycategory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features topjournalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-rays with the understanding that he would be considering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does notguarantee to review and he receives far more titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz</p>
