"Tour buses in the U.S_ just kick aÂ­ compared to European ones!" Tun- stall says with a note of incredulousness . "American tour buses are so swanky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have air fresheners and carpets!" What really stops her in her tracks is how crowds in so many places know the words to every song on "Telescope. " (Her tune "Miniature Disasters " has been used on 1V's "Grey's Anatomy," and "Suddenly I See" was in this summer's hit film "The Devil Wears Prada.") "It's so bizarre," says Tunstall. ''We went to Annapolis .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We didn't even know there was a place called AnnapÂ­ olis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We thought it was a typo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was it supÂ· posed to be Minneapolis? Indianapolis? But it was an amazing show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like, you close your eyes and you're in your bedÂ­ room playing, then you open your eyes and there are people from Ann3.polis in your room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's mad!" THE WRECKERS ~ RON SACHS it in their faces!" Branch says with a lau "But on another level, we worked really hard for this and we followed our guts, ; it was a big change for both of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And f it to work was pretty miraculous ." Even though New York doesn't have; country-music station, it feels like home the Arizona native (she and Harp recol'( the CD at a studio in the Meatpacking lJ trict).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But soon they'll be back on the rOl with Branch's daughter by her side. "It was a quandaIy , definitely ," says TunÂ­ stall. "It was a really difficiilt decision, beÂ­ cause 1 really don't "She's a good tour baby," says Brand "The only thing 1 feel guilty about is tha she doesn't see any other children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All s CD: Â·Stand Still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look Pretty" knows are roadies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's funny to se'e'Ule Perform: Sept 27 ata benefit at tattooed, basn'\-showered-in-weeks iU: like pop reality shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But ... at the end of the day, 1 would've been a fool to say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It got my song heard by 40 million people." In the end, Tunstall, 31, thought McPhee did a good job and was happy to have help winning over America the way she has the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Britain, her CD "Eye to the Telescope" has been a huge critical and commercial success, peaking at No.3 and snagging TunÂ­ stall a Brit Award for Best Female Solo Artist. "I started coming out to the States in faJl2005, doing venues like the living Room in New York," says Tunstall. "1 loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we did Mercury Lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now we've got a few nights at WebÂ­ ster Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fantastic .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a bloody massive country." Not that she's complaining: Tunstall loves the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She lived in Connecticut for her senior year of high school and fell in love with American music. "I was acÂ­ tually doing a solo tour of coffee shops," she says. "I really couldn't face being like Phoebe from 'Friends'! Because I've sat in coffee shops and when a girl with a guitar came in, I've just groaned .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've felt like, Please don't ruin my scone'" But now, she says, touring is a dream, especially with our great ... tour buses?

"There was a lot of pressure from different people," says the 23-year-old Branch. "A lot of people weren't hapÂ­ py with this little idea that we had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a couple weeks after finishing the rec.ord, 1 found out I was pregÂ­ nant [Branch is married to her bass player, Teddy Landau] .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We tried to keep it a secret as long as possible. "So we were on Maverick Re- , cords, and 1 felt like they were gonÂ­ . na throw [the CD] out there and if it didn't stick, they'd move on." Turns out, everyone was wrong -even Branch and Harp themselves .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the Wreckers, the two have become the first country duo to hit No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I with a deÂ­ but single ("Leave the Pieces") since the mammoth-selling Brooks &amp; Dunn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, their little side-project idea has taken on a life of its own.

" Unlike her eclectic collecti( of theater and art songs, "Bridge" is dOl nated by pop from the likes of Neil Villi Laura Nyro and Elvis Costello, Costello difficult song to sing," says McÂ­ from London, where she's before heading off for, well, more work. "We tease out the right arrangeÂ­ m!~,f?l~~ : It took a long time to find. absolute desperation of the it could be about someone maybe even an atheist; someone who has no other place to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say, All 'right, let me try this thing I don't even beÂ­ lieve in, because I am that desperate .'" In Neil Young's aching "My Heart," McÂ­ Donald heal'S "some sort of struggle with addiction." In "It Ain't Easy Bein' Green" (the Kennit the Frog favorite), it's the struggle to feel good about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But lest anyone think McDonald's gifts are limÂ· ited to high drama, she throws in witty gems by John Mayer, Rufus Wainwright and Nellie McKay. "All these songs, apart from the one that's actually from a Broadway show ["Dividing Day," from "The Ught in the Piazza1, sound like they could be in a muÂ­ sical," McDonald says. "I didn't want to do , all theater music this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm still atÂ­ . tracted to songs that fill the requirements for a theater song -they all have an emoÂ­ tional arc." 1-. .:...:..;.N=E::;:L=LI:..=E:..:M~c.;;.;KA:...=....;:Y.:.-_. _ CD: -Get Away From Me" Ned Up: "Pretty Little Head" in October Performs: At a benefit concert Oct 4 at the Hiro Balrroom She hasn't even released hl!r second alÂ­ bum yet, but Nellie McKay has had a storied, crisis-filled career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her first CD, "Get Away From Me," is often called the o)lly double-album debut by a woman in history -and McKay had to fight her label, Sony, to get it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she and Sony parted ways over the length of her second CD, "Pretty Uttle Head," which was originally slated for 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the album was delayed, McKay starred on Broadway in "The Threepenny Opera." "Pretty" is listed on Amazon.com as coming out Oct. 24, but the real date is rumored to be Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such confusion is par for the course for McKay, but HallowÂ­ een would be appropriate . since the 24- year-old mixes rock, folk, rap, jazz, cabÂ­ aret, Broadway stylings and everything else into a bewitchingly original brew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A member of PETA and a strict vegÂ­ etarian, McKay -born in London but brought up mostly in the city and in the Poconos -will be part of a concert at the Hiro Ballroom co-sponsored by ASPCA to benefit rescue groups and promote no; kill animal shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bill also includes the Beastie Boys, Marshall Crenshaw, Deborah Harry and MC Chi Chi Valenti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REGINA SPEKTOR r &lt; .. ".''''''' .... ~, â€¢ .-.~---- .......... - - ..... ---- ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CD: "Begin to Hope" Performs:Sept. 27 and 28 at Town Hall A Bronx girl by way of Moscow, Regina Spektor may have a flashy Web site and the obligatory MySpace page, but she has developed as an artist in a remarkably old-fashioned manner: reÂ­ leasing albums on a smaller label, touring, doing the requisite press and slowly workÂ­ ing her way up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, Sire Records has reÂ­ leased her sixth -and breakthrough - album, "Begin to Hope."' And like many of the best songwriters, Spektor creates tunes that are firmly rootÂ­ ed in where she lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On "That Time," she sings, "Hey remember that time when I . found a human tooth on Delancey?" And "Summer in the City" has a line that cerÂ­ tain New Yorkers might embrace: "I'm so lonely lonely lonely/ So , went to a protest just to rub up against strangers ." Yet it's her song "Fidelity" that stops the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spektor performed it recently on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien," prompting the host to gush, "That was amazing! That was one of my favorite perÂ­ formances in a long time by anybody!" Spektor, for her part, smiled shyly .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's the fans seeing her live who can really smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On "Fidelity," she delivers the line"._ and it breaks my heart" with a catchy sort of stutter, singing the last word as a plaintive "he-aaaaaaa-rrr-t-t-t ." AnyÂ­ one singing along to the song on an iPod would sound silly Yet with hundreds of people joining in with Spektor, it'll sound just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INDIA.ARIE V CD: "Testimony : Vol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I, Life &amp; RelatioJlShip" Porforms: Oct 7 at U,e Beacon S omerhing happens when IndiaArie sings t.he song" Privale Party" from her new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SomeLhing 5011 of ... intimate. " 'Private Party' is very sexy to me," she says, "because it talks about the feÂ­ male anatomy and appreciating it, you know what I mean? The way' feel when 1 sing it -, don't know what! do with my body, but the band is always like, 'Wooh!' I haven't seen myself [do that].' haven't reÂ­ corded any of the shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're always like, 'Dang, where'd you get that?'" All that won't come as a surprise to anyÂ­ one who's seen Arie live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But her first two CDs were so smart, and so aware of the world around her. that people might be forgiven for thinking that she's always at political protests wearÂ­ ing traditional garb. (She addresses the idea ' in the first single. "\ Am Not My Hair.") "When I hear a lot of my earlier mUSIC, I hear a female but one lacking a senÂ­ suality-there's a lack of sexuality in the sOW'ld," ays the wornÂ· " an born India Me Simp-"", son and raised in Atlanta. " "I think a lot of people relate to -, me in that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I have on a pair of jeans, people are like, 'Oh my God, look at you!' Everybod y wears jeans, but when' wear a pair, it becomes a big deal. "They say, 'I didn't know you were curvaceous like that.' My past two albums had, for lack of a better word, an asexual type of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think even though the subject matter Ion the new CD] is not sexual, because it talks about relaÂ­ tionships, it has a more sensual element to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that, to me, is very womanly ." It also talks about heartbreak : Arie was in a serious relationship, one she thought was heading toward marriage, that sudÂ­ denly ended, and she says it took three years to work through the anger and pain and produce "Testimony" songs like "There's Hope" and '" Choose," tunes that embrace forgiveness and self-respect .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has always had huge success; her first two CDs have sold 3 million copies, and Arie has won two Grammys and been nominated for 12 -but "Testimony" deÂ­ buted at No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I, giving Motown Records its first chart -topper since Diana Ross' "Lady Sings the Blues" in 1972. "Yeah, it is satisfying, because I did what I wanted to do and it worked," says Arie, who'll turn 31 four days before her Beacon show. "That's what really makes it cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were days when 1 was really sad goÂ­ ing over the different events in my mind of that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then to go from crying on the floor to No.1 on Billboard was a life journey that I will always remember ." â€¢ ~ â€¢ III c: z ~ z ~ ::l Ci Be '&lt; ::l (J) " &lt;ft n 0 3 c Â» e: z '" ::l: VI (f&gt; C ::l Cl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cl ':&lt; (f&gt; ct&gt; ~ 3 cr ~ tv ." tv 0 0 0)</p>
