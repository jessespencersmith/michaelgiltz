(This book is a good companion piece to "The Great Surge" by Steve Radelet, which goes into fascinating detail about all of this.) Theother track is to explain WHY people are so ignorant of this progress and what they can do to combat that ignorance.Essentially, Rosling offers handy ways to increase your critical thinking -- how to put the news of the day in perspective (thelatest news is almost always the latest negative news), how to question the numbers (good or bad) on any issue, how to judge a source of information and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of the great strides emphasized in "Factfulness" should encourage complacency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rosling knew the planet faces grave issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those can only be tackled when we all understand the basicfacts of our world and know how to think critically about what to focus on and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Gates dubs "Factfulness"the most important book he's ever read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, no, but it's a highly accessible summary of great news and offers useful tools for anyone willing to apply them. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúOne of the most important books I‚Äôve ever read‚Äïan indispensable guide to thinking clearly about the world.‚Äù ‚Äì Bill Gates ‚ÄúHans Rosling tells the story of ‚Äòthe secret silent miracle of human progress‚Äô as only he can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Factfulness does much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also explains why progress is so often secret and silent and teaches readershow to see it clearly.‚Äù ‚ÄïMelinda Gates "In Hans Rosling‚Äôs hands, data sings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global trends in health andeconomics come to vivid life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the big picture of global development‚Äïwith some surprisingly goodnews‚Äïsnaps into sharp focus." ‚ÄïTED "Three minutes with Hans Rosling will change your mind about the world."‚ÄïNature What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
