                <p>Saturday, February 16, 2019  FICTION How The West Was Won? Kevin McCarthy‚Äôs Historical Fiction Pulls No Cowpunches  November 8, 2018 Michael Giltz Westerns used to promise a simple tale of good versus evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that was a long, long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even way back when the best writers‚Äìlike Elmore Leonard and Larry McMurtry‚Äìknew better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today any author worth their saltknows if they‚Äôre going to write about how the West was won, then they‚Äôll also be writing about how the Westwas lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Kevin McCarthy knows this well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sets his new historical novel ‚Äú Wolves Of Eden ‚Äù just after the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The US military has pivoted from putting down secession to protecting settlers as they race out West for land or gold, and to hell with the Injuns in their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along for the ride are career soldiers and the poorbastards broken by the war or so used to violence they‚Äôre unfit for civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You‚Äôll find Irish and Germansand Italians and even a Jew or two, if you can imagine, not to mention Native Americans from various tribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCarthy captures the sweep of the era, the malignant memory of the violent Civil War that has poisoned the men who fought in it and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But above all he juggles four men and two competing narratives with vivid style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one, the Jewish Corporal Daniel Kohn finds himself burdened with caring for Captain Martin‚Üê Triggered By ‚ÄòCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Ballad Of Buster Scruggs‚Äô ‚ÜíMolloy, a drunken wreck of an Irishman haunted by his actions in the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kohn respects Molloy and can‚Äôt bear to see the man committing suicide by bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their superiors send them way out West to investigate the murderof a prominent citizen at Fort Kearney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their job is to find someone‚Äìanyone‚Äìto blame for the death and bringthem to heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, we read the diary of Michael O‚ÄôDriscoll, held in the stockade for that very crime, though it‚Äôs unclear if he committed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael and his brother Tom (a once-handsome man disfigured in the war) werehoping to earn a few dollars, then quietly ‚Äúresign‚Äù from the military and farm a plot of land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Things have notgone to plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCarthy has ‚ÄúDeadwood‚Äù-style fun with the grim realities of life on the ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethnic slurs fly about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs a raw and vicious world as typified by the scout Molloy hires for the journey. ‚ÄúJonathan‚Äù is a Pawnee whorefuses to give his real name (they would butcher it anyway).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He casually wonders if he should just kill theseuseless stragglers, but is happy to work alongside the white men if it means a chance to kill the Sioux, a peoplehe hates with real passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs a rich and compelling tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCarthy falters only in withholding two key bits of intelligence: how the citizen at the fort was actually killed and the dreadful act during the war that Molloy can‚Äôt shake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creating anunnecessary air of mystery does neither set piece any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far better is McCarthy‚Äôs use of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here thereal Battle of the Hundred-in-the-Hands of 1866 provides a good backdrop to the action, not to mention a greatand terrible victory for Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians (Crazy Horse among them) who banded togetherto crush the white people once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or so they imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael O‚ÄôDriscoll does begin to realize thesoldiers really don‚Äôt belong where they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the grass seems to be whispering to him that they should goaway go away go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that whispering is soon drowned out.
