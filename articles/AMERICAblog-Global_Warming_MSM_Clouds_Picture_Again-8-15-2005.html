                <p>M O N D A Y , A U G U S T 1 5 , 2 0 0 5Global Warming: MSM Clouds Picture Againby Michael in New York on 8/15/2005 03:15:00 PMSurvey scientists and you'll discover that there is no debateabout global warming or how humans are affecting this process-- the only questions are how quickly it's occurring, what theeffects will be and the most effective ways to counteract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OnFriday, many media outlets ran a story about three newscientific papers that undercut one of the remaining Alamos forthose who want to dispute the obvious -- that's the argumentthat the atmosphere had cooled in the tropics and not warmedin the troposphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, the papers in the online journal of"Science" show that the scientists making this claim had madea simple mathematical error and that other measurementswere faulty for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a difference anewspaper makes.The New York Times presents the issue a tad confusingly onpage 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also quotes the scientists who developed theoriginal troposphere temperature records -- John R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christyand Roy W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spencer of the University of Alabama in Huntsville-- who concede mistakes but insist even revised calculationsproduced a warming rate that was no big deal.But read USA Today's story on page 3 and you get a muchclearer description of the mistakes.[Researchers] found that the satellites had drifted in orbit,throwing off the timing of temperature measures.Essentially, the satellites were increasingly reportingnighttime temperatures as daytime ones, leading to afalse cooling trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team also found a math error inthe calculations.That's pretty darn clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How did the NYT describe it? "The satellites'orbits shift and sink over time, their instruments are affected bysunlight and darkness, and data from a succession of satellites has tobe calibrated to account for eccentricities of sensitive instruments."Also, USA Today also went to the front group funded by the big oilcompanies for a quote:Mark Herlong of the George C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marshall Institute declined tocomment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group, financed by the petroleumindustry, has used the data disparities to dispute theviews of global-warming activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent years,however, the institute has softened its public statements,acknowledging that the planet is indeed getting warmer butstill maintaining that the change is happening so slowly thatthe impact is minimal.But what neither story tells you is that the original authors of thestudy (quoted by the NYT as sticking to their guns) are apparentlyfunded at least in part by that very same front group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day beforethose stories ran, the George C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marshall Institute posted a releasepooh-poohing the new studies and referring to the work by theAlabama researchers as "our (University of Alabama in Huntsville"UAH") satellite estimate for global lower tropospheric ("LT")temperature trends since 1979."In other words, one of the few minor islands of dissent is finallyanalyzed by others and found to have simple math errors, not tomention the rather obvious problem of taking temperatures at nightrather than day and not acknowledging that disparity (gee, thinkyou'd get lower temperatures at night?) and it's all apparently fundedby the oil industry.Why didn't the New York Times ask the researchers it quoted who Political WireMcCain Lawyers Investigated Obama Citizenship -As we asked earlier this week, if questions overPresident Obama's citizenship were valid, wouldn'tthey have come out during the presidentialcampaign?
