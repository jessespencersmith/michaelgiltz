Assuming you're vaguely familiar with the Spiderman comics and the great Tobey Maguire movies made from them, there are no spoilers as such to reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gawky teengets bit by radioactive spider and tries to juggle school, work as a low-paid freelance photographer and agreat girlfriend with the annoying responsibility of saving the world and fighting the Green Goblin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show begins with Peter Parker (Reeve Carney) giving a report in school on the Greek myth of Arachne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Greek chorus of women (not the Geek Chorus from the show's earlier version) appears inmid-air, swinging out towards the audience on long yellow banners of cloth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As they sing and move back and forth, horizontal bands of cloth are lowered and the women are literally weaving the cloth into a pattern in mid-air as they tell the story of Arachne, the greatest artist at looming who challenges even thegods with her talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a simple, beautiful, and very theatrical effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very little in the show matches itfor simplicity and style, but it's your first indication that if Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark is notable for anything, it's the sometimes chaotic but always bold and interesting set design and costumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker's classroom is also clever: it's a pop-up affair with half the classroom just a visual goof of cardboard students and desks with a slanted hallway heading towards the back of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throughoutthe show, we get some good nods to comic books in the design, especially the skyscrapers of New YorkCity (presented in perhaps a dozen different ways, all of them eye-catching) right down to the "To Be Continued" visual that appears at the end of the first act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Peter walks home after being bullied by a UN cross-section of kids, the streets also get a nifty representation in hand-drawn backdrops that fold and re-fold to indicate different streets andperspectives as Peter walks on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a cool effect, though it becomes overused throughout the show until itfinally seems a little lame, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lab for Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin is also casually MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

The technical aspects areclever, with Peter suspended by wires in his bedroom, which is represented by four or five "walls" held inplace by humans mostly hidden behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter literally bounces off the walls, pinging back andforth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Reeve Carney sings the verses and then jumps here and there and everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, it'simpossible to do those gymnastics (sometimes upside down) and sing properly, so the chorus is handledby an offstage group of singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the chorus of a song is when the singer explodes with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sthe hook you've been waiting for melodically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But because of the demands of the stunt, just when wewant to hear Peter bursting with emotion, he has to stop singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't think of how they should have handled such demands, but this is no small issue and has a lot to do with why this show feels so emotionally distant and inert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When we want our star to burst into song, hehas to remain quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or when the big action scenes are taking place, we know we're often watching stand-ins and hearing voices come from backstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the webbing is a let-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Confetti is the natural and obvious choice, but when it pops out of Spidey's wrist and just sort of gently floats down on a villain, well, you get the general idea but it's notexactly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stunts are certainly technically challenging and fun to see in a Broadway house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthey're not beautiful or emotionally important, just sort of...fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even that pales after the fourth or fifthtime around the theater for our hero or the evil Green Goblin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've seen more entrancing work at any Cirque Du Soleil performance, though unquestionably it was a huge challenge to deliver them over an audience night after night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain elements stick out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a goofier, more comic show, the passing moment when a building is on fire and someone shouts "My baby" in a long, drawn-out wail while a giant cardboard baby floats down onlyto be caught in a giant Spidey palm that pops out from off-stage in an overs-sized, cartoon style mighthave been truly hilarious rather than just odd and dorky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's tempting to call the handsome Carney bland, but why blame him for the dull songs he tries to liven up? He's certainly better than Jennifer Damiano as Mary Jane, who certainly looks the part but strainsduring her singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither is helped by the sound, which makes many of the lyrics unintelligible,especially during big numbers where multiple people are singing at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark is a mess, albeit a coherent mess, as opposed to earlier reviews of the show in previews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set design is playful at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The visuals can be striking, such as when Spidey is singing a big number and the visual flourishes of skyscrapers come fast and furious in the videodisplays, creating a sense of excitement otherwise missing from the tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But just as often, the costumes and sets get in the way, weighing down the actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story hits all the main points of the comic and movie versions, right down to a curtain call where Spidey arrives upside down and gets to kiss MaryJane, just like we remember from the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a pity there's nothing in this show that isn't just a pale reflection of other, better versions that came TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 12 Halle Berry's Flawless Bikini Bod Olsen Sister Flashes HerBra Scarlett's naked pics, TylerPerry is highest paid MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Entertainment News at THR.com More Celebrity News at People.comKirstie Alley AllegedlyDemanded Dramatic Helicopter Entrance At 9/11 Memorial America's Got Talent Picksa Winner READ MORE Michaele Salahi Was NotKidnapped as Husband Claimed READ MORE Susan Powell Searchers Find Human Remains READ MORE Cher Lashes Out On 'Terrified' Chaz Bono Haters Anna Faris On Her Boob Job &amp; Bulls*it Women Actress Friends PHOTOS: Johnny Depp Gets Creepy Like 2K Baby Bump Of The Year!
