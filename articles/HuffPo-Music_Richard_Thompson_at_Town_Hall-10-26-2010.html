Work out the songs...on the road!" So, like Jackson Browne and Joe Jackson and too many to mention, that's what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is Dream Attic, which is neither a landmark work of his nor a flop but simply a new album by Thompson, stronger this time melodically than lyrically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Movies | Gwyneth Paltrow | The Kardashians | Bristol Palin | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP LIVE UPDATES: Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords Shot, Federal Judge KilledGet Breaking News by Email SHARE THIS STORY Like11 likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sign Up to see what your friends like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 14 Democratic Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot, Federal Judge Killed At Public Event Suspected Arizona Shooter Identified: Disturbing YouTube Videos, MySpace Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

(As Addison Steele points out below, this has been going on a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just consider the current fad for doing so a notable revival of that old habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has it ever been this prevalent though? Almost everyone is doing it right now.) So his current show begins with all 13 songs from his new CD and then moves ontohis vast catalog of brilliant work. (And where oh where is the boxed set of Richard and Linda Thompson,remastered, with a bonus CD or two of live stuff and extras in a nice compact box once and for all?) I wasn't gutted that my guest and I were late getting to Town Hall (thanks, NYC subway system!) and came in during the second song because the first -- "The Money Shuffle" -- is far and away the weakest on the album, with tepid digs at the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not surprisingly, the album's songs sounded better live despite being road-tested by the band because the album's strength is its melody and they could stretch out further in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In case you didn't know, Thompson is easily -- yes, easily -- thegreatest guitarist in history on both the acoustic and electric guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's certainly right up there in either category alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in the fact that he's a world-class songwriter and you've got a sense of his skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tonight, it happened first on "Sidney Wells," a song in 9/8 time Thompson helpfully told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A piercing, driving number, the music built and built and built with Thompson tearing into a guitar solo that virtually lifted the crowd off its feet. (I say virtually because we actually stayed seated so we wouldn't missa note before leaping and roaring our pleasure.) Thompson was deep into it when he slowly worked his way back out again, finally looking up at his bandmates with a look of pleasure and setting them all off on another fierce passage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world is filled with virtuosos, guys who can play the guitar in a fast and flashy manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is it about Thompson's playing that elevates it so? First, of course, the solos are musically consistent -- theyfollow an internal logic (often a mathematical one that we instinctively respond to even if we couldn'tparse it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Thompson's solos are never just about runs or showing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're also emotional journeys. "Sidney Wells" is about a cold-hearted serial killer who boasts about what he's done when the cops finally come calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thompson's solo is a cry from the heart, both a reflection of the violence, thetortured mind of Wells and the women he slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm bringing all that to the music, of course, but the truth is that his solos aren't just impressive: they're moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then show stepped into high gear when Thompson dug into his catalog of songs. "Time Will Show The Wiser" kicked things off, a gem from the first Fairport Convention album. (They're the British equivalent to the Band, but folkier.) Then he blew us away again with "You Can't Win," a more recent tune that's abit of a workout -- a song the band can stretch out on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thompson did that again with another coruscating solo that equaled the brilliance of "Sidney Wells." Another showstopper was "Al Bowley's In Heaven." Once mostly an acoustic number, it was the tune that stopped 'em dead every night, the way "1952 Vincent Black Lightning" does now (Thompson is resting that classic for the moment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's performed beautifully and then gives everyone a moment in thespotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This touring band also plays on the album and simply because of where I was seated, I wasfocusing on drummer Michael Jerome a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a striking figure behind the drum kit, towering over them (quite a tall fellow) but playing with subtlety and skill and noticeable pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drum solo is one of the more dreaded conventions in rock but he made it a delight. "Wall of Death" -- from the masterpiece Shoot Out The Lights -- was given a full-bodied treatment and then they wrapped it up with the romp "Tear Stained Letter." For the encore, Richard returned to the stage with his son Teddy, who has grown stronger and stronger with each one of his solo albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They sang a duet on the Tim Finn of Crowded House gem "Persuasion." That's the very first number manypeople heard from Teddy, when he joined his dad onstage years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fascinating to see how much 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS jwoww naked miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant snooki nude More Celebrity News at People.com PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss Like 720 Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton Joins Future In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp; Vanessa Hudgens Back On?

Oh, "Man In Need," that's a terrific one. "One Door Opens?" Oh and "Tear Stained Letter" still gets 'em moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thompson is such a wry, friendly presence that his every utterance draws a chuckle from the faithful (most of the time a deservedone, though sometimes he'll say "thanks" and they'll still be in stitches).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His core audience returns again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't spend the show waiting for some epic solo -- every song has passages of show-stopping brilliance from someone in the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you know that at somepoint, he'll stop your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it's a lyric that cuts home, maybe it's a strangled vocal or maybe it's hearing an old favorite for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But invariably it's also a musical solo that tears you down and builds you up at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You expect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, you demand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it still surprises andmoves you every time. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift Kourtney K.'s StunningBikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER House Of Representatives Facebook Video HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES More Celebrity News at Popeater.com One And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,228 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,031 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 106 Comments PHOTOS: Raven- Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss 532 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 65 Comments Director: 'Ghostbusters 3' Is Happening 88 Comments Comments are closed for this entryMichelle Williams onKeeping Heath's Memory Alive153 Fans 36 Fans 59 Fans 3 Fans 8 Fans 145 FansI've seen Richard Thompson solo 3 times and he is one of the greatest performers I've ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He plays the guitar like NO ONE else in the biz, imo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is always up and in a great mood/energ y and is such a humorous man as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am a big Richard Thompson fan, but I must correct a factual error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing an album in its entirety is not a new rock trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the early 1970s, it was commonplac e for bands that considered their albums "concepts, " particular ly the prog-rock groups like Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, to play whatever album they were promoting all the way through and as much like the studio version thebetter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The effort usually resulted in a stage absolutely cluttered with instrument s so that, for example, guitarist Steve Howe of Yes could play five or six different guitars in one song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I should have worded it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's certainly been done before but surely thepractice has never been this widespread ? It seems like EVERYONE is doing it, from major acts to cool indie bands and not just prog-rock acts like Genesis and ELP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for thereminder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've tweaked the comment in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, we saw RT in Wilmington DE a couple of nights before the NYC show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thefirst set really did showcase the new record perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second, I am unsure of the year, but I saw Jethro Tull play several weeks before the release of "Thick As A Brick" was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ian Anderson started off byannouncing that the band would play a "cut" from their forthcomin g LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That took about 45 minutes! Talk about opening a show with a complete album set! (If youdo not get the silly irony here, you are too young.) I saw the show in DC last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will probably my show of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd seen Richard solo acouple of times but this was the first time with his band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will be back in NY (solo) next March: http://www .richardth ompson-mus ic.com/Tou r.asp There is a box set out of Richard's work called Watching the Dark, 3CD's worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a lot of unreleased live tracks and the like.NFL Gun Control iPad Haiti Earthquake Atheism Sarah Palin MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POSTRecency | Popularity catcancook 02:57 PM on 10/28/2010 Permalink | Share it addisonsteele 07:49 PM on 10/27/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:45 AM on 10/28/2010 Permalink | Share it Paul Schatz 10:19 AM on 10/28/2010 Permalink | Share it dunedin 09:07 AM on 10/27/2010 Permalink | Share it JaneaneTheAcerbicGoblin 02:14 AM on 10/27/2010 Permalink | Share itView All 54 Fans 22 Fans 59 Fans 22 Fans 5 Fans Follow 14 Fans 56 FansI first heard Richard back in '72; the album was First Light, with Linda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am a mo ron!!!!!!!
