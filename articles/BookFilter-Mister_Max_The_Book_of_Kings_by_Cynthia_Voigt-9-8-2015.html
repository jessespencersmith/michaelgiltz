I read all three books within a few weeks so perhaps that helped me appreciate the arc even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway, Isuppose you could read the third book alone, but why would you? It's a trilogy and meant to be read that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; InBook One, Max lives in a quaint sort of turn of the century kingdom with his parents who run a theatrical troupe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maxloves them and the theater but it's not quite his thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exactly what his thing will be, this 12 year old boy isn't quitesure about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His parents are lured to a far-away country to establish a new national theater company and Max isaccidentally left behind with his librarian grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They realize the parents have been kidnapped and worry andworry and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To maintain his independence, Max becomes sort of a detective, though he insists on callinghimself The Solutioneer. (Why the books aren't called The Solutioneer remains a mystery to me.) There's also a girlthat annoys Max with all her questions and a boarder in Max's home who has a mysterious past and other danglingthreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there's the set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At first, Max solves rather mundane or obvious problems like finding a lost dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; InBook Two, however, Voigt takes a quantum leap forward: Max is now solving problems of the human heart andshowing a great deal of insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Book Three, Max and his friends head off to rescue the boy's parents in the LatinAmerican dictatorship they're trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final volume is especially good, with remarkably complex passagesdepicting that awkward moment when a child sees their parents as people, flaws and all, not to mention somecompletely earned but still bravura changes that make clear the pattern Voigt was creating from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ReadBook One alone and -- like me -- you might consider it a pleasant diversion, with so-so mysteries but appealingcharacters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book Two is much better and Book Three deepens the entire work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a magic trick the way shesuddenly reveals the life Max was intended for all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I plan to read more Voigt right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highly recommended. -- Michael Giltz P.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm convinced we'll see more of Mister Max and his eyes, which are an odd sort of grey, perhapsthe grey of a computer screen when you've just powered it down and the energy seems to be draining away orperhaps the grey of a London fog when you don't quite know where you're going and there's no other light aroundexcept the dull glow of street lamps that haven't been cleaned in a while, a murky sort of menacing but perhaps notreally dangerous grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something like that.LessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
