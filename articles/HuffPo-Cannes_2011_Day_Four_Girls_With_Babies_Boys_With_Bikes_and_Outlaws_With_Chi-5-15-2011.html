Everyone is chomping at the bit to see Terrence Malick's The Tree Of Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not since Wong Kar-wai's 2046 has a movie come to the festival with critics so desperate for itto be undeniably great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the Dardennebrothers -- one of the most remarkable talents of the last15 years -- deliver yet another gem but it was treated as just more of the same by some. "Oh, John Ford made another western? Ho hum." WU XIA aka DRAGON or SWORDSMEN ** 1/2 out of ****This enjoyable martial arts flick combines the subgenre of wu xia with TV's CSI to create a detective/action movie that's pretty fun, even if it does get in its own way sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero is a modest man living in China in the early 1900s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He came to a small village from far away, took a new name and an abandoned(but beautiful!) young mother for his wife and treats her son as kindly as the child they would havetogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When two vicious killers invade their world, our hero Liu (Donnie Yen) throws himself at thembut somehow we suspect in his fumbling desperate manner, he is employing vastly superior skill to defeatthem without revealing to others the martial arts expertise that he possesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It works for the simplevillagers he calls friends...but not for the detective (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who arrives to officially MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 New Photos Emerge In Anthony Weiner Twitter Scandal Anthony Weiner Admits Sending Racy Pictures, Refuses To Resign FOLLOW US PHOTOS: Who Won Big At This Year's 'Fashion Oscars'?Nancy Pelosi Wears Vintage Thierry Mugler To 7 Sites You Should Be Wasting Time On Right Now7 Celebrity Fad DietsBIG NEWS: Celebrities LeAnn Rimes Movies Celebrity Body Smarter Ideas More Log in | Sign Up News Web Bad Guy?

READ MORE LeAnn Rimes: I'm in theHealthiest Place of My Life READ MORE Clooney's Girl, ElisabettaCanalis: 'I Will Be Married' Out of the darkness will appear a little boy that Michael, our protagonist, keeps locked in his basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suspected that as soon as I spotted the noise-muffling sponges on the inside of the doorway leading tothe basement; they gave me an immediate sense of dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is not a horror film, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forhorror films aren't about real pain; they have villains we know will be vanquished or at least beaten backbefore resurrecting for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Michael , all we have is desperate reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An unassuming middle-aged man (almost comically cliched in looking like a pedophile) goes about his day in a calm, deliberatemanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He does his job, interacts with coworkers just enough not to appear (too) strange, comes home,lowers those blinds, prepares dinner and then and only then allows the boy to come upstairs and eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They watch TV, the boy is sent back down to the basement at 9 p.m., the man comes down and rapes him, the man cleans himself off and then goes to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie is heartbreaking in its directness because you feel so helpless watching this story unfold and wonder what, if anything, will end it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point, the boy hand-writes a card which I assumed was forthe man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The way he so carefully folded it and then sealed it in an envelope struck me as so sad -- itwouldn't be any surprise that he might curry favor with the man who overshadowed his entire life anddecides what petty favors he might grant the kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man takes the letter, reads it and then files it awaywith a pile of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only later do we discover that the boy actually thought he was writing a letter to his parents, people the man lies and tells him in an angry moment have insisted they never want to see the boy again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some bravura moments appear here, especially the scene where the man is carefully scouting out another boy to kidnap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trusting child is lured away by the man to a parking lot when finally, finally, at thelast minute we hear the voice of the kid's father calling him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael never breaks his stride, slowlyand casually continuing to walk away even as his plans are frustrated, but also never running in case hecalls attention to himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The muttered comments of the boy talking to his dad don't mention the nicestranger he was talking too until our hero is safely away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a chilling moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, what keeps Michael from greatness for me was that while the film was always engrossing and assured (and the two leads excellent), I never felt any insight either into the pedophile or the boy whose life he is destroying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's undeniably an accomplished work, however disturbing the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I was shocked when this film was the first (and so far only one) of the fest to receive a chorus of loudboos from critics upon its debut. 17 FILLES/17 GIRLS ** out of **** Based on a true story, the premise of this film was so striking I wanted to be sure and see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps it was the image on the poster -- a string of teenage girls, all visibly pregnant and smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film has asimilarly vivid moment when many of the pregnant teens are in a pool, helping each other exercise andfloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sight is so unusual, it can't help but seem strange and beautiful, though the movie We Need ToTalk About Kevin used the same visuals to show how a woman can feel her body has been invaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, it was an open invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the good-looking and charismatic Camille (Louise Grinberg ofThe Class ) accidentally gets pregnant, it starts a bizarre trend in her small, seaside town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One girl who longs to be a part of Camille's clique announces that she is pregnant too and is suddenly part of the team.Then Camille somehow makes being pregnant seem liberating and fun and an act of Three Musketeers-like solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They can all get pregnant and leave their boring families and share a big house and taketurns doing the boring stuff!

Why is he so fraught with tension? Jean stumbles away and into the arms of a family "friend" who takes the kid on a hunting expedition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the movie gets trulymurky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man's girlfriend or wife takes a shine to Jean, making sure he gets a rifle when the man onlywants him to have a stick and serve as a beater on the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean takes the gun and scopes out his homefrom a hill high above, like an assassin or an outsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man reaches out to Jean by making the kidfeel welcome but also has a violent temper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But wait a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the tradition of so many art films, it'sslowly becoming clear exactly what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man might be Jean's biological father, which wouldexplain why both have such short fuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Jean's brother and dad know this, which explains theircomplicated relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We know Jean didn't torch his brother's car, but the truth never bothers tocome out though it would seem awfully germane as the film trudges along to a climactic showdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thatshowdown with everyone gathered in one place doesn't begin to answer all the questions we have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But bythis time, we don't really care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First time director Roland Edzard brought together a fine cast and solidtechnical crew; too bad he didn't give them the sturdy, clear script they deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LE GAMIN AU VELO/THE KID WITH A BIKE *** 1/2 out of **** Some filmmakers just strike a chord with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their style, their stories, their obsessions just click with you on some fundamental level and you are continually drawn to their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly the casewith me and the Dardenne brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean-Pierre and Luc are unquestionably one of the major cinematictalents of the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was mildly disappointed with their last movie, Lorna's Silence, a plot-heavy HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Mexico Afghanistan Scott Walker California The Kardashians White House Video Urlesque Unemployment Buy a link here We investigated work at home jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What we found may shock you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HomeJobManual.com Mom Is 55, Looks 30...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clever Mom Reveals $5 Wrinkle Trick That Has BotoxDoctors Furious!

Can he make mistakes and still recover from them thanks to anadult in his life who actually cares about him? I literally had no idea what would happen at the end ofthis movie, finding the tension almost unbearable as I usually do at their movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gives nothing away tosay that, for once, I wondered what might happen but hoped against hope that it wouldn't be disaster.That, for the Dardennes, constitutes progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And this film ranks with La Promesse, Rosetta and The Son as yet another gem in their growing list of top-notch movies. *****Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionReese Witherspoon In 'Who Invited Her?
