For me, that was never an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year at Cannes, I scan the running times of ALL the movies at the fest in onecategory or another, whether it's in Competition or the Directors' Fortnight or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find the longest movie of them all and commit to it right then andthere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I figure, if it's that long, there must be some reason they said yes to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This policy has stood me well, most notably when I was one of the lucky few to be among the first to see the Italian masterpiece The Best Of Youth back in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three hundred and thirty minutes with a fifteen minute break? Bring it on! DAY EIGHTCARLOS *** 1/2 out of **** -- I initially gave Carlos a more subdued three stars out of four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's remained with me and the central performance by Edgar Ramirez is so subtly accomplished that it deserves more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The life of the terrorist and self-styled revolutionary Carlos is shrouded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only biographies I could find focused mostly on the efforts to track him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's no surprise that director Olivier Assayas plunges right into the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within ten minutes, Carlos has passed a jobinterview with people fighting for the Palestinians and is quickly tossing bombs around with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Convincing in period detail, the movie hurtles through his public career, from assassinations to hijackings, from clumsy early efforts to more sustained operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film is broken into three partsand will benefit from being seen over two or three nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine watching the shorter, theatrical MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 BIG NEWS: Celebrity Skin | Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

(Corruption is an inescapable fact of Italian life.) Will it be blowback from the accidental death of a night watchman they hushed up? Will it be his kids?Suddenly his wife goes into labor and we fear the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The baby is healthy but the wife simply dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the rest of the film, Claudio will try to cobble together some sort of new existence, first by pushing his boss into giving him a building project of his own to fund and then by reaching out in desperation tofamily and friends as the project overwhelms him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I enjoyed this movie much more than most of thecritics here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothing else, I'll keep with me the haunting, searing funeral scene where Claudio howls out the lyrics to his wife's favorite pop song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Germano is definitely one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAY NINE FAIR GAME ** out of **** -- Sometimes, events are so compelling in real life that trying to recapture them in a fictional film is fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly the case here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are good as Valerie Plame Wilson and Joe Wilson, the couple raked over the coals by the Bush White House after Wilson accurately called them out for lying in the State Of The Union when making its case for invading Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That State of the Union had two key points about Iraq: UK evidence that it had tried to purchaseenriched uranium in Niger and that it attempted to purchase aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both statements were demonstrably false, with overwhelming evidence from multiple sources that the Niger purchase never took place and overwhelming scientific analysis thatdemonstrated the aluminum tubes were in no way suited for nuclear weapons production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The White House knew this and included them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Joe Wilson wrote an op-ed calling them out on the facts he knew to be untrue (about Niger), the White House immediately retracted the statement andadmitted it should not have been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It then spent the next months and years attacking Wilson, breaking the law by outing his wife as a CIA agent and did everything it could to change the topic from why the White House included information it knew was a lie to who is Joe Wilson and did his wife gethim a "junket" to beautiful downtown Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Doug Liman film does a fine job of reminding us of the key facts and showing the pressure on the private lives of these two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What it doesn't do is dramatize in any compelling new manner the story that we know so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POETRY ** 1/2 out of **** -- Director Lee Chang-dong has a penchant for female roles and he delivers again for actress Yun Junghee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She gives a fluttery, sweet performance as a lonely grandmother raising her sullen grandson, providing daily care for an elderly stroke victim and facing the onset of Alzheimer's.Overshadowing it all is an unidentified scandal involving her son, other boys at his school and the dead body of a girl who committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically for the film, we never discover exactly what the boys did but it's bad enough for the school to be eager to hush it up and the parents involved to offer a huge cashpayment to the girl's mother not to press charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throughout this muted drama, Yun is taking a poetry writing class and occasionally attending poetry readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She struggles to write one decent poem herself, a tricky proposition when even simple words like "wallet" suddenly become slippery as eels to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatlittle narrative drive there is fades when we realize most events will remain unexplained or off camera. 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Lohan ticketed 1 of 7 camille grammer lady gaga natalie portman pregnant raven- symone rebecca budig More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Recommend History Channel Won't Show Katie Holmes Miniseries The Kennedys READ MORE Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo to Guest Star on Hawaii Five-0 READ MORE Lindsay Lohan's Post- Rehab Gift: a $25,000 Necklace READ MORE Petra Nemcova Engaged to British Actor Stephanie Seymour Caught Kissing Her Son?

(Believe me,this is all relative; most people would find this fest fare utterly inpenetrable.) No fears on that count: his passionate followers declared it brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is simple: Uncle Boonmee is dying and his sister and nephew show up...followed shortly by the ghost of his dead wife and the hairy, monkey-like visage of hisson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say the house is surrounded by spirits and Joe begins to recall past lives, in a way, assuming images of an ox in the fields and other animals reflect the past lives he might have lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe feels compelled to head to a cave, where apparently he was born in his first incarnation thousands of yearsago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tossed in there somewhere is a flashback to an earlier life where we see a princess emotionally drawn to a commoner but then seduced by a talking catfish which magically transmutes her into another fish (though not before an unexpected and hitherto unimaginable moment of human-fish sexual congressas it flops between her leg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether Uncle Boonmee was the princess, the commoner or the catfish, I can't say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I did follow all of it, until a finale with more ghosts (I think) and a nod to Thailand's current political woes that set me adrift for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this rate, Joe's next film will be a comedy and I'lllove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wahlberg visits U.S. troops in Afghanistan Kendra Wants AnotherBaby MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Death &amp; Dying CPAC Katie Holmes Harry Reid Wikileaks Pollster Twitter LA Restaurants LA Around TownHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »PHOTOS: Ellen DeGeneres &amp; Portia de Rossi's Exotic Vacation 158 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 903 Comments PHOTOS: Raven- Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss 474 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 92 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 62 Comments Ashton Kutcher: Training, Paranoid About Real Life 'End Of Days' 903 Comments Comments are closed for this entryFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recency | PopularityView All</p>
