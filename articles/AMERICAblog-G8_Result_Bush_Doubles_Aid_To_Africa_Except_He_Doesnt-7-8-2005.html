ExceptHe Doesn'tby Michael in New York on 7/08/2005 04:40:00 PMBush is lying again and using the cover of far more generousnations to hide the fact that he is playing semantics whilepeople die needlessly in Africa and climate change becomes amore and more dangerous threat.So what happened at the G8 summit? Bush was pulled kickingand screaming into sort of, kind of half-admitting the simplefact that burning fossil fuels contributes to climate change.(Not that he's willing to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush is certainExxonMobil et al are going to say to hell with profits and fightglobal warming on their own.)But in a truly callous, unChristian and despicable act, Bushsigned off on the pledge by the eight industrialized nations todouble aid to Africa in the next five years...and thenimmediately distanced himself from it.But [Bush's] point man for the summit meeting,Faryar Shirzad, a deputy national security adviser, saidlater that the aid commitment involved no newmoney from the United States, only adding upincreases previously agreed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's oppositionalso helped doom calls for the rich nations to committhemselves to providing a defined proportion of theirnational incomes to aid to Africa, a step that wouldhave required much larger contributions from theUnited States.So when Bush pretends he is doubling aid to Africa in the next fiveyears he is actually refusing to increase aid by a single penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isthe same tactic he used when Blair came to the White House: Bushreleased about $600 million that had already been allotted to Africaby Congress and pretended it was new funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't, but theMSM got it wrong again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you see any news stories inthe next few days claiming Bush agreed to double aid to Africa in thenext five years, point out how his own advisers "clarified" that andadmitted they weren't increasing aid by a single penny above whatBush has already committed to a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American peopleare generous and open-hearted -- look at the private donations afterthe tsunamai -- but they are tricked into thinking our gov't isgenerous too with foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We are the cheapest major nation inthe world, the one that gives the LEAST amount of money (as apercentage of our GDP) to help our neighbors.And if that isn't bad enough, Bush lies and tries to pretend he's doingmore when in fact he's doing less, dragging his heels to deliver thefunds already committed and blocking medical aid to the sick anddying with his politicized attacks on international aid organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IfBush had stayed out of the African fight against AIDS, more peoplewould be alive today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's some "assistance."
