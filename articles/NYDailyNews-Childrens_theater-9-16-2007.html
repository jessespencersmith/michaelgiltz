The hour-iong "0o9," with a cast of half a dozen tail-and-earred performers (plus a bemused accordion player) "wasn't your typical fairy tale," says Laura Stevens, who co-founded l\4CT with Bruce Merrill, who helmed that show "lt took all the elements of theater and really made imagination be a central part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music was fantastic and the costumes were great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're going to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've had other shows that would sell out the whole run But that one ws oacked." Still amded that a theater company dedicated to children's progmmming can make a go of it - MCT hd a generous, not-a- bad-seat-in-the-house location at 52 White St., nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown - Stevens is excited about pushing the boundaries of what people can expect from kid's theater with "coodnight Moon," which is cutrently running through Dec. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following that will be "Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse," from Dec. 15 to Feb. 3, 2008; "Hansel &amp; Gretel," Feb. 9 to March 30; " ild the .: return of 'lf YouE ; c o FooN @ o !

"Our whole goal is to have a theatrical'think tank,'where the kids are not only participating in what kind of world they want, but they also become the voices of positive change," says Mansouri."When they do these musicals, an adult audience listens to the themes with a different view" Mansouri talks passionately about the impact theater can have on kids and says auditions for the next season will take place this month and next month, with performances in January and February at its main space in the Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But CTC is active in the schools and community year-round.

"Has somebody joined us from the audience?" Horejs says. "Yes, some of the puppeteers saw our shows over the years and then wanted to join us." A recent revival of "Faust" just concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up next from the smart, literary-minded company is "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" in November at lane's Carousel. 56 Water St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW VICTORY THEATER (U6) 223 - 3020 : ww. newicto ry.org jewel of a space on 42nd St., the restored New Victory is the highest-profile space dedicated to children's theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Virtually any time ofthe year, you can 90 to the New Victory and be assured of an engaging production cherry-picked from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Upcoming productions include "Comet in Moominland," a combination of puppetry and live actors based on the quirky best- selling kid's books, Sept. 28 through Oct 14; "The Wolves in the Wall," based on the creepy Neil caiman book, Oct. 5-21, and the Golden Dragon Acrobats from China, Nov 30 through Jan. 6, among manyothershows a</p>
