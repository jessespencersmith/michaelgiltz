                <p>A handful of the season's most anticipated popcorn fare for gay and lesbian audiences By c ael Iitz Now playing or open~ng soon The Holy Girl (now playing, limited): When a man who brushes up against teenage Amalia sexually in public starts to date her mother, Amalia decides he must be saved-apparently, by placing herself in tempting proximity to him again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a hint of lesbian subtext.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executive-produced by Pedro and Agustin Ahnod6var (among others). (Fine Line) Queer Quotient: ** Mysterious Skin (now playing): See reÂ­ view, page 68. (Tartan USA/TLA) Queer Quotient: ********* Mad Hot Ballroom (now playing, limitÂ­ ed): This crowd-pleaser about the thouÂ­ sands of New York City fourth-and fifth-graders who take part in an intensely competitive ballroom competition-sort of a SpeUbound with music-is great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The finale might have been scripted by Hollywood. (Paramount Classics) Queer Quotient: ** Ma Mere (May 13, New York City, Los Angeles): Isabelle Huppert plays a widow who decides to introduce her 17- year-old son (Louis Garrel, The Dream- THE ADVOCATE I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I MAY 24, 2005 ers) into the pleasures of sex via her old girlfriend, and then her new girlfriend, and then a little group orgy with some sadomasochism on the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rated NC-17.

(Regent) Queer Quotient: ******* Saving Face (May 27, limited): Out writer-director Alice Wu's festival faÂ­ vorite is a low-key charmer about a Chinese-American lesbian (Michelle ~ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I summer I preview Krusiec) and her sternly traditional widÂ­ owed mother (Joan Chen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mom's auÂ­ thority falters when she shows up pregÂ­ nant and refuses to say who the father is. (Sony Pictures Classics) Queer Quotient: ******** June High Tension (June 3): Classic '70s slasher films are given an intelligent but tense update with this French horror film set in a deserted farmhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When high schooler Marie spies on pal Alexia in the shower, you know the boogeyman can't be far away. (Lions Gate) Queer Quotient: ****** Lords of Dogtown (June 3): Hot dudes abound in this fictionalized yarn about the California surfers who turned skateboarding into the coolest sport in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Johnny Knoxville and Heath Ledger in supportÂ­ ing roles. (Columbia TriStar) Queer Quotient: ** The Adventures of Shark Boy &amp; Lava Girl (June 10): Queer kids will easÂ­ ily identify with this 3-D family film from writer-director Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids )-the story of a 10-yearÂ­ old loner who spends the summer alone with his imaginary friends. (DimenÂ­ sion/Columbia TriStar) Queer Quotient:** (for that title alone) Heights (June 10, limited): See cover story on page 54. (Sony Pictures Classics) Queer Quotient: ***** Mr. and Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith (June 10): A married couple-both secretly profesÂ­ sional assassins-are bored with their life until each gets an assignment to kill the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not queer, but it's got Brad Pitt for the guys and Angelina J olie for the gals. (20th Century Fox) Queer Quotient: * Batman Begins (June 17): The Dark Knight has always had a homoerotic undercurrent-and Joel Schumacher's Batman &amp; Robin proved that "under" is where it should stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This reimagining of Batman's early years stars Christian Bale as the comic-book hero. 'Nuff said. (Warner Bros.) Queer Quotient: ** My Summer of Love (June 17): See reÂ­ view and feature on pages 64-65. (Focus) Queer Quotient: ********** Bewitched (June 24): Only a John WaÂ­ ters could come close to the queer quoÂ­ tient of TVs Bewitched, thanks to Paul Lynde, Dick Sargent, and the imperious Agnes Moorehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This movie has a game cast-Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Shirley MacLaine as Endora, and Amy Sedaris as nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz-and a very meta plot, about the filming of a Bewitched remake in which they've unintentionally cast a real witch, but the camp factor seems low. (Columbia) Queer Quotient: *** Herbie: Fully Loaded (June 24): See feature story on page 60. (Buena Vista) Queer Quotient: ***** Rize (June 24): Legendary out photogÂ­ rapher David LaChapelle focuses his video camera on the dance craze called "krumping." None of the African-AmeriÂ­ can subjects comes out, but the street choreography is exhilarating-and may go further into the mainstream than vogueing. (Lions Gate) Queer Quotient: * Tropical Malady (June 29, limited): This arty Thai critics' favorite delicately limns the growing affection between a relatively worldly soldier and the younger farm boy he romances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the movie literally stops and begins anew, retelling a mythic tale about a wild beast and the hunter who must kill it or be devoured by it. (Strand) Queer Quotient: **** July Fantastic Four (July 8): More comic-book queer subtext, this time in the form of an alternative family: the Thing, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch. (20th Century Fox) Queer Quotient: *** Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (July 15): Out screenwriter John August reportedly insists he'd never seen the Gene Wilder version before adapting the Roald Dahl classic into a new vehicle for director Tim Burton, starring Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In previews, Depp's Anna Wintour look makes pirate Jack Sparrow seem positively butch. (Warner Bros.) Queer Quotient: **** Happy Endings (July 15, limited): Writer-director Don Roos returns to the loopy comic terrain of The Opposite oj Sex with this freewheeling comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Coogan plays the unwitting father of Lisa Kudrow's child-he's now teamed with his lover (David Sutcliffe) in a fight with lesbian friends who may be hiding the fact that the men's sperm donation actually was successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then it gets really crazy. (Lions Gate) Queer Quotient: ******** summer preview Three Dancing Slaves (July 22, New York City, Los Angeles): Gael Morel (the pillow-lipped star of Wild Reeds) cowrites and directs this erotic French story of three brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The middle child thinks he might be attracted to older exÂ­ con Christophe, and the youngest knows he's attracted to his best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All shot in the most deliriously sexy style smce Beau Travail.

(Strand) Queer Quotient: ******** Ethan Mao (July, New York City, Los Angeles): Quentin Lee's third film comÂ­ bines the tragic characters of Thomas Hardy and the love-drunk figures of Kar Wai Wong in a thriller modeled on HitchÂ­ cock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its hustler hero, with his drugÂ­ dealing boyfriend, impulsively takes his own family hostage overnight while tryÂ­ ing to reclaim his belongings. (Margin) Queer Quotient: ********* August and after Formula 17 (August, New York City, Los Angeles): This swoony romantic comedy with a gay spin that became a box-office hit in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seventeen-year-old sweetÂ­ heart Tien heads to the big city of Taipei for the summer and immediately catchÂ­ es the eye of the biggest playboy heartÂ­ throb in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all very irmocent, so don't expect anything more explicit than the latest issue of Tiger Beat. (Strand) Queer Quotient: ******* The Dukes of Hazzard (August 5): Not gay and yet extremely gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now a new generation can yee-haw it up with Bo (Seann William Scott), Luke (Johnny Knoxville), and Daisy (Jessica SimpÂ­ son).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg.

(TLA) Queer Quotient: ********* Cote d'Azur (September 9, New York City, Los Angeles): The codirectors of The Adventures of Felix return with a frothy comedy that would set even KinÂ­ sey's head spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During a family seaÂ­ side holiday the teenage son is bonded tight to his best friend, who is in love with him, while Mom and Dad have their own secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the son's pal meets a hot plumber in the dunes, and things get really farcical.
