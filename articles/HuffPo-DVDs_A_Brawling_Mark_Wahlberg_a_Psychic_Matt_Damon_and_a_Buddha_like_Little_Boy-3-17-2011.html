(That is not a plot point, by the way.) Au Revoir isbased on a childhood memory of director Louis Malle about the Jewish boys hidden in their Catholicboarding school during WW II until the Nazis come and ferret them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's heartbreaking and lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iinterviewed Malle shortly before his death and did something I rarely do which was to praise this film inperson and say how much it meant to me and how I believed he had done his memory justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's usedto praise and probably forgot it an hour later but I was glad I did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.comStefano Langone RevealsHis Relationship Status READ MORE Royal Wedding Guest ListRevealed: Who's Going?

(It contains both the BluRay and BluRay 3-D version; my TV is not 3-D compatible.) If you're really intoeither of these sports, this brief but amazing looking flicks could work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimate Jordan is a muchmore substantial collection of four highlight films from Jordan's career as well as five key games from his career in their entirety along with other extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it's a huge letdown if you watch the IMAX movie first because these pre-HD titles have not been remastered sufficiently or the source material is sodegraded that it kind of seems subpar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're a fanatic, you've been warned; the content is great.Finally, Walk On Water follows surfers Tyler Hallen and Luke Davis as they travel the world looking for some gnarly waves but end up finding Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES NBA Afghanistan Fast Food Gas &amp; Oil NASA Hockey Brian Williams Gabrielle Giffords Mexico MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Viral Star Antoine Dodson ARRESTED Like 5K Gwyneth Paltrow Is Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're All Jealous.

Because they -- or their agents/managers -- can't pick good scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even when Anniston is in a hit film, it's usually bad and she doesn't get the "credit" as far as Hollywood is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bateman can't seem to get any traction despite being in great movies like Up In The Air and Juno , cult favorites like Extract and hits like Hancock and Couples Retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Switch will change nothing for either of them, despite being a romantic comedy about best friends who, surprise,finally realize they're perfect for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I wish Burlesque were much better or much worse than it is, but you can't have everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just... is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHARKTOPUS ($24.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay) -- This movie is a different kind of bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the Saturday night SyFy scare-fest starring a ridiculous creature that's "half shark, half octopus, all killer!" Of course it's awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with a name as silly as that and an awesome poster you kind of want to see it anyway,don't you? And thus was the drive-in movie born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even Roger Corman thought it was a bit much but thathasn't stopped him from presenting it, has it?
