InJanuary, she gave birth to her son, Orson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last summeq, she starred in Shakespeare in the Park's "Romeo &amp; Juliet," which gar- nered Ambrose great reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, she'll be seen as an ambitious graduate student who latches on to her writing idol @layedbird" when she was I l, she has "a problem with au- thority."
