                <p>62 E o u ~ .~ c: Everyone knows the names of the cast of "Cheers." "CHEERS": COMPLETE SECOND SEASON "FRASIER": COMPLETE SECOND SEASON One sign of a truly great sitcom is that your atten­ tion doesn't wander when an episode focuses on one of the secondary characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That certainly was true of "Cheers." For example, when Carla's hairy ex-hus­ band Nick Tortelli showed up, the show was every bit as hilarious as when it focused on the love-hate torment of Sam and Diane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true for "Fra­ sier," which mines laughs from the travails of Niles, Daphne, Martin and Roz just as easily as from the pompous Frasier Crane ($49.99 each, Paramount). "BABYLON 5": COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON "WISEGUY: MEL PROFm" "Babylon 5" still ranks as one of the most audacious shows in TV history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was designed from the start to tell one long story that would climax in the fifth season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, viewers got no truly satisfy­ ing conclusion to anyone season or episode, because it was all building up to the grand finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what were the chances it would last exactly five seasons? It did, and this set brings you one step closer to the end ($99.98, Warner Bros.). "Wiseguy," on the other hand, benefited from self-contained story lines that lasted roughly half a season, with Kevin Spacey's magnetic turn as Mel Profitt ranking as the low-rated show's high point ($59_99, Studio Works). "IKlRU" Director Akira Kurosawa's name instantly brings to mind sweeping Shakespearean epics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many feel his masterpiece is 1952's "Ikiru" ($39.95, Criterion), a poignant, slow-moving study of a civil servant who is dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one will be surprised that Criterion does it proud, with two extensive documentaries and a scholarly commentary track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company's HVE line deserves more attention as it releases famed Jap­ anese titles less familiar to Westerners, like director Kinji Fukasaku's 1968 yakuza thriller "Blackmail Is My Life" ($29.95, HVE), a tale of young punks who foolishly try to blackmail business associates of a major crime boss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great fun and ripe for remake. "OUT OF TIME" Good guy Denzel Washington isn't so noble as a Florida lawman who gets duped but good by a pretty girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mining his misfit side, Washington stars in this low-key nair with the moral lawmen should consider -never, never "borrow" drug money from the office safe to payoff a nice lady's medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out: The gunfight at the OK Corral inspired any number of great films, including John Ford's 1946 "My Dar­ ling Clementine," starring Henry Fonda ($19.99, Fox); Spencer Tracy was such a brilliant actor, no­ body questioned him when he insisted on playing the lead in 1941's "Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jekyll and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hyde" ($19.98, Warner Bros.) without elaborate makeup -he'd sim­ ply suggest the beast within us all, while Frederic March used every prosthetic trick in the book in his Oscar-winning performance in the 1932 version also included; few actors wore a dress as amusingly as Cary Grant in Howard Hawks'1949 spoof "I Was a Male War Bride" ($14.98, Fox); and maybe joining the "Family Business" ($49.98, Showtime) isn't so bad when that business is the adult film industry, as shown in this truly out-there reality show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out next week: The French mystery drama "Swimming Pool"; and lots of complete first seasons from TV, namely the goofy "Green Acres." the campy "Lost in Space" and HBO's "Curb Your Euthusiasm."</p>
