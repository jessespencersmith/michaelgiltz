She even tells the classic anecdote about the very first song that Pop Staples taught to his children after being disgusted with the no-shows at rehearsal for his gospel group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That first song? "Will The Circle Be Unbroken." Will she sing it? Yes, of course she will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crowd at the sold-out show in Brooklyn ate it up, perhaps since many of them were seeing Staples in concert for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her every reference to Jeff Tweedy (who oversaw her latest album, one of themost acclaimed of the year and gave Staples a lovely new standard wit the title track "You Are Not Alone") was greeted with applause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calling him a funny little thing pleased them even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST BIG NEWS: James Franco | Movies | Rihanna | George Clooney | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FINAL COUNTDOWN Maddow, Bill Maher React To Olbermann's MSNBC Exit Oprah To Reveal Huge Family Secret Monday Raoul Felder On Celebrity Splits, Divorce News Of The Day Howard Fineman: 'Loss Of Steam' In GOP Health Care Repeal Efforts Signs That Your 'Loving Relationship' May Be An Addiction Professor Targeted By Beck Gets Death Threats Michelle Bombshell To KatLOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign Up Like 18K Like 912 Like 892 Like 72 Like 145 Like 527 Recommend 3K It was an enthusiastic crowd but they didn't quite feel the gospel numbers in their bones; yes, they hooted and made some embarrassing (if sincere) stabs at some "amens" and "uh-huhs." So the show never transcended, the way Staples can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she certainly is a pro and her band was so tight that when they gave her a rest by performing not one but two instrumental numbers (including "Sometimes I Feel LikeA Motherless Child") it wasn't just filler and the crowd would have happily listened to more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helpedthat Staples was sitting in a chair onstage next to her sister, smiling and raising her hands when the spirit moved her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even on a routine night in the middle of the week, Staples might not have won any souls over (this was a tough, secular New York crowd after all) but she certainly won a few new fans whohaven't even seen her at her best yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FITZ &amp; THE TANTRUMS *** out of **** Bowery BallroomIt's the early 60s in the music scene and I don't just mean the classic soul leaning and natty clothes of Fitz &amp; The Tantrums .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean that album sales are sliding but bands are bursting with talent and live music matters as much as it has in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look at the steadily growing success of this group, which in about a year has gone from a showcase at Joe's Pub to a sold out show at Mercury Lounge to a sold out show at Bowery Ballroom, with fans growing increasingly fanatic at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They shimmied, theyshaked, they got down on the floor when commanded to (and heck, I'd do just about anything backup singer Noelle Scaggs told me to do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their handclapping could use a little improvement but that'll come with practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's next for the band? A sold out show at Irving Plaza and then the Beacon, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They definitely put on a tight, satisfying show that outshines their fine full-length debut, which boasts tunes like the title track "Pickin' Up The Pieces" and "Breakin' The Chains Of Love." It's not quite a retrosound -- the conspicuous lack of guitar (which bores frontman Fitz) is one sign, as is their repeated nodsto Eighties pop like Hall &amp; Oates and Eurythmics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So while the band is much stronger in person, the same can't be said of Fitz and his songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His voice isok, but not a patch on, say, Daryl Hall (which he can vaguely resemble at times) or Sharon Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the tunes show their lack of versatility heard back to back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One song is called "6 A.M." and the next tune they performed began "Woke up at 6 am".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And another song is called "Wake Up." You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 1 of 5 Harry Shearer The President’s Panacea for Business Regs: The Cost-Benefit Ratio Sec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kathleen Sebelius Health Care Repeal Will Raise Costs for FamiliesDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS ashton kutcher jennifer aniston rehab kourtney kardashian natalie portman pregnant nicki minaj Von D: He WILL Cheat On You New Scam Spreads Like Wildfire On Facebook More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Like 114 Like 32K Suspect in 1987 Infant Kidnapping Surrenders READ MORE John Travolta's BabyBenjamin: Youngest Copilot Ever?

Their workout on "Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)." So a few conflicting emotions here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band was a lot of fun and Fitz is definitely a showman. (He even gave a shout out to his dad and mom sitting in the balcony, who spent much of the concert using theircell phone to take pictures, just like the other fans.) Definitely check them out in concert for a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while new numbers sounded very much in the same vein, it will be interesting to see where Fitz goes from here in an album or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have the vague impression he could go in a number of different musical directions and isn't wedded to a classic soul vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe Jackson, Paul Weller, even Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners could be a better hint of where he's at musically than say, James Hunter who is blue eyed soul through and through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitz might go in a pop or rock or some other thoroughly unexpected direction; I just get the impression his musical tastes will wander far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With great musicians by his sideand a growing fanbase, people are gonna talk no matter where he heads. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE : Michael Giltz was provided with free tickets to the concerts with the understanding that he would write a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 Oprah's Big Secret Sacha Baron Cohen Takes on Saddam Hussein Megan Fox Strips Downfor Armani MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER NFL Kindle HIV/AIDS The West Homelessness Education Israel NBA Predict the NewsHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Recency | PopularityLogin or connect with: More Login Options Post to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to TypePad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Tumblr.To reply to a Comment: Click "Reply" at the bottom of the comment; after being approved your comment will appear directly underneath the comment you replied to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share your Comment: Post Comment Preview Comment View All WATCH: MTV's 'Skins' Airs Teen Lesbian Love Scene 831 Comments Olbermann Headed To Hollywood? 463 Comments Jason Mraz Wants Gay Marriage 201 Comments Michelle Bombshell To Kat Von D: He WILL Cheat On You 710 Comments Matthew Perry &amp; Matt LeBlanc's Onscreen Love Triangle 77 Comments Ashton Kutcher: Training, Paranoid About Real Life 'End Of Days' 913 Comments MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.</p>
