                <p>T U E S D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 0 6 , 2 0 0 5Questions For Condiby Michael in New York on 9/06/2005 10:03:00 AMI can't believe the MSM is letting Condi Rice defend thePresident's callous indifference to the suffering and deathduring the worst natural disaster in our nation's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whyaren't they asking Rice to defend her own shameful actions?Some questions:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What was Rice's exact itinerary during the worst naturaldisaster in our nation's history? What time did she leave for herNew York City vacation? It was late Monday or Tuesday -- afterthe levees broke and the disaster spiraled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But itwould be nice to know exactly what horrors were going onwhen she decided it was time for a break.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did Rice enjoy "Spamalot?" Tickets normally cost $100.00but they're very hard to snag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How much did her tickets cost?When Rice responds that the question is inappropriate at atime like this, ask her why GOING TO THE SHOW IN THE FIRSTPLACE wasn't inappropriate at a time like this?3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What else did Rice do on Wednesday while New Orleans wassinking into chaos?4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How much did the shoes Rice bought at Ferragamo on FifthAvenue cost exactly? Can we see them? Reports say the pair ofshoes cost in the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was she really accosted by awoman who berated Rice for being on vacation during theworst natural disaster in our country's history? How did thatmake Rice feel? Does Rice realize that while she was spendingan obscene amount on shoes that Americans were diggingdeep into their pockets to donate money to the Red Cross andwondering how else they could help? Does she realize what aterrible contrast that is?5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When and where did Rice hit tennis balls with Monica Seles?Did she watch any television during this pleasure trip? Did shesee images of the death and destruction in her own home stateand throughout the region?6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When did Rice decide to cut her vacation short? Thursdaymorning? Thursday afternoon? Why did she cut it short? Howmany countries had called her offering their support and aidwhen she got back to work on Thursday afternoon? When didthey call? Did anyone return those calls on Monday? OnTuesday? On Wednesday? When did Rice herself return thosecalls offering precious medical and rescue aid?7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How can Rice possibly defend GOING ON VACATION duringthe worst natural disaster in our nation's history? How can shedefend the President staying on vacation during the worstnatural disaster in our nation's history? How can she defendthe Vice President STAYING ON VACATION FOR THE ENTIREWEEK during the worst natural disaster in our nation's history.Isn't it obvious that a key reason the Bush administration failedcompletely during those first crucial 72 hours was because allof its top people were on vacation and didn't bother to returnto work?8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When is Rice going to apologize to the American people?
