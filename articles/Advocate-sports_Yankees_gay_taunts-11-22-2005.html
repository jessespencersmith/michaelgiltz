                <p>r Baseball behaving better Yankee Stadium is no better or worse than other sporting venues when it comes to fans using gay slurs-go to a game and you usual· ly hear people heck­ le an outfielder by saying he's Ua fag­ got" Or that he "goes both ways-men and boys." Go to a hockey or football game and you'lI.hear siml­ lartaunts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Cohen, a gov­ ernment employee in his mid 30s from Clifton, N.J., is a heavy-duty Yankees fan-who even frequents gay sports Web sites to talk about his paSSion-and also goes to games in hock­ ey, soccer, and other pro­ fessional sports with his partner of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus, he knows that hearing that kind of language Is the price you pay if you want to go to a sporting event. "Usually I'll just turn around and shake my head: he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Cohen's days of hearing perhaps the most YOUR ~DDY11 notable example of gay slurs at Yankee Stadium are coming to an end, In 1996 the team began the tradition of playing the Vil­ lage People hit "YMCA" be­ tween the fifth and sixth innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly afterward, fans in the rowdy bleachers began the tradition of sin­ gling out a fan of the op­ posing team, surrounding them, and singing new lyrics; "Why are you gay? I saw you sucking that O+C-K: and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That ribald tradition ended on June 14 during a game against Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This reporter was present In the stands when security officials and police offl- www.advocate .com cers-who usually laughed along with the rest of the fans when the song was sung­ suddenly swooped in and escorted the peo­ ple leading the tune out of the stadiUm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New rules, the cops said. (Calls tothe Yan­ kee organization to clarify the "new rules" were not returned.) Fans complained loudly and bitterly. 'What Is this, a pollee state?" some asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But after a few games they accepted It as the way things were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gay fans have even noted an­ other positive side effect: Since the police clamped down on "Why Are You Gay: fans are much less likely to yell gay slurs at outfielders for fear of being ejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen, who can't get to many games at Yankee Stadium, is Just hearing about the new policy. 'Wow," he says, 'Wow, If the Yankees did that, I would be very proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And If they fead, other teams wHl fOllow." -MIchael Glitz Nove m b e r 2 2. 2 0 0 5 I 55</p>
