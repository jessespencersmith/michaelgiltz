Ii,stor and longtime Apollo mainstay Biil!YiMitchell. ''When people walk past, they see the new marquee," says Mitchell, who began working at the Apollo when he was a kid running errands for starS like Redd Foxx, Ray Charles and Moms Mabrey. "Inside, the audience will see plasma screens on the walls, a brand-new stage, new seating and new stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've taken a beating from fans for the way the place looked in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, when one comes to the Apollo Theater, they say, 'My God, look at this place.' " [t's the latest step in a multiyear, top­ to-bottom revamping of the Apollo, where "Amateur Night" has reigned every Wednesday since 1934.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly e¥€lyone has noliced rhe new marquee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But preBident an.d CEO Janelle Procope sayS the c f.Mes are the most signifi- fSince the Apollo's doors ,~ e reopened in 1981 by fl' 'I Sutton, the business­ and one-time Manhattan ugh presiden t. ,) . 'We replaced all the seats, [but] they're still a replica of the original ones," says Procope . 'We've completely redone the stage, as well as our greenroom, which will make it better for cocktail parties and other pre-concert events." Upcoming shows include Dionne War­ wick's return to the Apollo on Sept. 21 af­ ter many years, the solo debut of "Ameri­ can Idol" winner Fantasia Barrino on Sept. 22 and Queen Latifah on Nov. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a new batch of shows for the syndicat- ed series "Showtime at the Apollo" (which launched in 1987) will tape at the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometime in the next two years, the theater will briefly shut down again for more interior restoration .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even during that work, the Apollo will forge ahead with plans to raise money for an endowment (it's a nonprofit organization), continue the recently launched internship program for high school students, and prepare for its annual fund-raisers as well as a 75th­ anniversary celebration that will last from July 2009 through the end of 2010. ~ il: ~ z ~ " Q Despite all the ambi- tious plans, it's impossible to forget the history of the place. "When they cut up the stage, I was in tears," admits the 56-year-old Mitchell, who tells stories about everything from his grandparents seeing the debut of Ella Fitzgerald to the night comedian Bill Maher asked for the air conditioning to be turned off and the crowd sweated and drank and laughed like crazy. "I was crying when they tore up that floor - I know all the greats that have per­ fonned on that stage," Mitchell says. "I had the construction guys give me a piece of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm going to have it framed. "The rest of it was thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People have come in and said, 'You could have put that on eBay.' " • REFLECTIONS Among the thousands of performers to shake, rattle and roll on the Apollo's storied stage are James Brown (above), Diana Ross and the Supremes (left) and then-Little Stevie Wonder (below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Apollo back in the day (1.1, advertising a show by Otis Redding and the Marvellettes, among others, on its old 125th St. marquee. ~ ·It ;; ~ '" ~ U</p>
