It is, indeed, a new play by the promising writer David West Read,presented simply but with professionalism by directorEvan Cabnet and a solid cast that do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See it andyou'll be reminded anew of the skill of lead actor ReedBirney and look forward to Read's next show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gettingthe chance to see his work performed with such care should prove invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is a familiar one: a high school student has dropped dead in the hallway and everyone from teachers to his family and friends are struggling with how to react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boy's sister (Alexandra Soche)resents how all the students make such a show of their mourning (and take full advantage of the daysthey can skip school and not be in trouble).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His girlfriend (Jessica Rothenberg) feels pressured to grievepublicly and regularly, not easy when she apparently fooled around with his best friend (Jake O'Connor).But most interesting of all is his favorite teacher Larry (the always solid Birney), who doesn't seem to begrieving enough at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prodding from the school conselor, a former student Larry can't take seriously(played very well by Matt Dellapina), will eventually draw out the revelations we know are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump Rip Each Other In Heated Political War Of Words PlayStation Network Could Be Down For Days FOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Tribeca Film Festival | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Essentially, a series of bookcases are rearranged repeatedly to reflect a classroom, a library and a counselor's office quite effectively, aidedespecially by the sound design of Jill BC DuBoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is strong top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while the storyfeels familiar, it's constructed efficiently and clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it's also constructed a little too neatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The teacher is haunted by a recurring memory of his last chat with Dane (Josh Caras), the student who left his classroom and died a moment later in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first scene of the show depicts the final moments of the boy's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then towards the end of the show, we see that scene again, fully awarethat we're watching the teacher's dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an unsettling, effective moment, coming right after anintriguing scene where Dane's sister behaves unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These two scenes together raise all sorts offascinating issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They make us believe these characters can surprise us and move us by capturing thatfrustrating sense of regret and missed opportunities that can so unsettle the people left behind when alife is cut short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the perfect ending, doing what theater can do better than any other art form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the show went on for about another ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're given a Good Will Hunting scene where the teacher has an emotional breakthrough and is able to begin to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all too rote and neatly tied up in a bow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Read can realize his play went on a little too long, that the need to connect the dotsand give us some closure is the wrong one, that art should unsettle us, not reassure us, he'll build on thispromising work and this fine production and deliver something great the next time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
