In the 1950s, a young Indianapolis minister named Jim Jones preached a curious blend of the gospel and Marxism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His congregation was racially integrated, and he was a much-lauded leader inthe contemporary civil rights movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eventually, Jones moved hischurch, Peoples Temple, to northern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He became involved in electoral politics, and soon was a prominent Bay Area leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this riveting narrative, Jeff Guinn examines Jones’s life, from his extramaritalaffairs, drug use, and fraudulent faith healing to the fraught decision tomove almost a thousand of his followers to a settlement in the jungles ofGuyana in South… Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say Like most people, my knowledge of cult leader Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple begins and ends with Kool-Aid and a mass suicide in Guyana in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This fascinating biography tells the story of his entire life and it makes for a quietlygripping read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't speak to what's new here compared to earlier books and I've never seen any of the films or documentaries about that bizarre episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is a convincing, matter-of-fact work that presents Jones in as objective a light as one could ask for, no small task given the terrible end he brought to his followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more interestingly to me,author Jeff Guinn helped me understand how someone could be involved with the Peoples Temple without being theShare This Book About The Author Jeff Guinn MoreJeff Guinn is a former award-winning investigative journalist and the bestselling author of numerous books, including GoDown Together: The True Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde, The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K.Corral and How It Changed the West, and Manson: The ….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guinn lives in Fort Worth, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: April 11, 2017 Publisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Pages: 544 ISBN 10: 1476763828 ISBN 13: 9781476763828gullible or foolish prey for a charlatan that outsiders might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My empathy for those ensnared in a cult for whatever reason is greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins simply with the story of Jim's mother, a woman prone to grandiose lies and determined to make a notable life for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When that doesn't happen, she settles for being the mother of a boy who is sure to become a great man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Guinn, Jim Jones had a gift for winning over people from an early age, an easy way with a lie andan even easier way with the half-truth that pulls others onto your side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intriguingly, much of his early life and ministry isweirdly compelling and in a way admirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim Jones had a lifelong devotion to racial and economic justice that was real,if complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His work in Indianapolis was progressive, helping to integrate many of the city's businesses in a way that made him appealing to those on every side of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But also from the start we see duplicity, such as his willingness to preach the Bible while privately disdaining a belief in a "Sky God" and really wanting to lure people towards Marxism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WhileJones duped folks with fake mind readings and fake miracles, he also delivered a genuinely progressive and positivemessage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones put it into practice with soup kitchens and integration of his ministry and college scholarships -- real andpalpable changes in the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Peoples Temple was a place that didn't just promise a better life in the hereafter but helped anyone with the problems of today, whether it was navigating red tape at City Hall or helping elect like-minded politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He appealed to Bible thumpers and Marxists, to disillusioned people of faith and atheists andsomehow held it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His methods always contained the original sin of lies and deceit, but you can see why so manypeople felt drawn to the tangible work the Peoples Temple accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes it all the creepier as Jones becomes more and more megalomaniacal, as he veers from mocking the idea of God to claiming divinity for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones became a drug-addled fool and at the same time a detail-oriented leader of a vast enterprise generating millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He toyedwith running for office or fleeing the country to establish a base in Brazil or the Soviet Union or Cuba or ultimately Guyana.He went from a faithful and happy marriage to running a virtual harem of female (and male) followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contradictionsand confusions build and build until the only surprise is that it didn't all end even sooner in disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For anyone with the slightest interest in cults or Jones in particular, this is a revealing work. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “I have to say that it is weird to find out the background of things that I grew up hearing about around the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The level of research and detail in The Road to Jonestown is the best ever, and really lets readers understand not only what happened, but how and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book tells the Jim Jones story better than anything I have read to date.” - Jim Jones, Jr. "Magisterial. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guinn's exhaustive research, shrewd analysis, and engaging prose illuminate a monstrous yet tragic figure--and the motives of those who lost their souls to him." - Publishers Weekly "A vivid, fascinating revisitation of a time and series of episodes fast receding into history even as their forgottensurvivors still walk among us." - Kirkus Reviews What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
