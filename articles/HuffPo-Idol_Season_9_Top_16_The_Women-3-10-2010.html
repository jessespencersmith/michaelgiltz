(It was a reference to his comments on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno in which Cowell said she would probably end up in his lap by the end of the season.) Why waste time? Ellen seemed a little more relaxed and succinct while Karacontinues to unveil a new look every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on with the eight performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KATIE STEVENS -- Sang Kelly Clarkson's #6 hit "Breakaway," which Randy declared was one of his favorite pop songs of the modern era! (If any Clarkson deserves that praise, surely it's "Since U Been Gone.") As with the very young Haeley Vaughn, Katie just seems way way too young to be performing on this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katie was flat and off from the get go in a painful vocal; even Simon felt bad for her and said she took notes well, giving her a 10 for 10 for effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what exactly is Kara DioGuardi hearing when shesays Katie has "a great radio voice?" SIOBHAN MAGNUS -- Sang The Animals' first and only #1 hit "The House Of The Rising Sun." Though it's a song about a bordello, she began it a cappella (which Kara declared BRILLIANT, as if noone had ever heard Whitney Houston begin a song that way), making it seem more like a prayer than the rueful, world-weary tune it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she gained some steam and had some good passionate moments, though when she really went for a strong note it made me more tense than excited (is it a certain tensionin her voice?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only Simon pointed out how dowdy her outfit was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LACEY BROWN -- Sang Brandi Carlile's sole Hot 100 charting tune "The Story," which went to #1 in Portugal. (Thanks, Wikipedia!) I'm unfamiliar with the song and found Lacey's performance very good, from her green nail polish to her poise and lovely, quirky vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She began sitting on the edge of the stage and was smart to stay put. (Too many try to get up and move around.) Let the cameras do the work.She was confident and her voice sounded cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her best yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Playboy | Movies | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 34 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World WATCH: Demi Moore In A Teeny Bikini Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Lindsay Garvey iPhone Alarm Glitch: How It Cost Me My Job Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin WATCH: Ashton &amp; Natalie Get Naked, Have Sex In New Movie Two House Republicans Violate Constitution With Voting Blunder BECK IN TROUBLE? Recommend 63K Like 114 Recommend 465 Recommend 1K Like 302 Like 6K Like 137 Like 15K KATELYN EPPERLY -- Sang Carole King's "I Feel The Earth Move," the two-sided single (with "It's Too Late" on side A) that went to #1 for five weeks and propelled her classic album Tapestry to sales of more than 22 million copies around the world. (You don't own it? You should.) Katelyn had a keyboard on stage, but the producers kept her instrument so low in the mix, it looked more like a prop than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was fine but dull, especially on the moments where King got soulful and she paled incomparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katelyn also ran out of breath towards the ends of some lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon's critique was spot-on in its cruelty: she sounded like a performer taking requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIDI BENAMI -- Sang Fleetwood Mac's #11 hit "Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)" from their breakthrough album Fleetwood Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stevie Nicks is so iconic, you might think the song HAS to be sung while twirling around in gypsy clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Didi strapped on an acoustic guitar and kept the song simple and true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was very good and one-upped Lacey, who sings in a very similar style. (There was a weirdaudience applause sound when she finished, probably due to the sound mix not being adjusted properly right away.) To my surprise, Randy and Ellen were slightly reserved, while Kara and Simon gave her the much stronger review she deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PAIGE MILES -- Sang "Smile," whose melody is by Charlie Chaplin, with lyric authorship somewhat disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige has been confused from day one about what to do, which is especially telling right now when you're not even limited to a genre or songbook of an artist but can do virtually anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terribly dull, as the judges all agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRYSTAL BOWERSOX -- Sang the biggest hit of Tracy Chapman's career, the #3 hit "Give Me One Reason." (It stayed there for five weeks, thanks to a logjam at the top between Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.) The very first line was a tad tentative and (purposefully) diverged from the song's melody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iwondered for a moment if Crystal would maybe stumble this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As if.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On playback even the openersounded fine and the rest of the song was excellent, with Crystal jamming on electric guitar and dirtying up the bluesy number to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More and more, she seems like an heir to Bonnie Raitt and I can't wait to find out if she's a decent songwriter too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head and shoulders above the rest: they're competing;she's performing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The funniest part of the song was a very glum Katelyn spotted on the balcony, clapping along mechanically and looking miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My only question is when will Crystal fix her teeth? My guess is she'll wait till after the finale so she doesn't lose any authenticity points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LILLY SCOTT -- Sang Patsy Cline's very first #1 hit on the country charts, "I Fall To Pieces." She sported a mandolin, but just like Katelyn's keyboards, it was miked so low the mandolin looked like a prop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her dress was country store cute but her hand-crafted earrings looked like pot holders or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sounded terrible at first but sort of righted the ship in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still she had a lot of rough moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another problem is that she and Lacey and Didi all sing in a quirky jazzy sort of style.Fans of the style will naturally gravitate to just one of them as their favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To my surprise, three of thejudges gave strong praise with only Simon thinking she might have faltered with her "quirky" choice. (Simon, it's a great standard for a reason; not a strange choice or dangerous one at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was her performance of it that could hurt her.) Obviously, half of them are vulnerable and only two have to go home, with Katie Stevens almost certain to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She'll be joined by Katelyn Epperly, Paige Mills or Lilly Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My guess is it'll be thetwo K's: Katie and Katelyn, with Paige giving a huge sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: Simon Cowell Kisses His Fiancee On 'Jay Leno' (VIDEO) Simon Cowell introduced his fiancee, Mezhgan Hussainy, to Jay Leno on 'The Tonight Show' Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon wouldn't give any timeframe for the wedding...

Are you kidding me, people? First, I agree -- she won't be fixing them for the duration of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second... are people really CRITICISIN G her for her teeth? Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like I said last week -- Didi will surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige -- good god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was simply Awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just... dear lord, what WAS that? That was a "You're going home, dude" performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katie, by all rights, should be going home with Paige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan and Katelyn were, in the banal words of Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson, "just okay," but okay enough to be safe, in my world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really don't think Kately deserved the ripping she got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're right about thekeyboard -- lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lilly was better than okay -- not her best, but good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Lacey is really hitting her stride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I dig her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's just adorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am dismayed by people who mention Crystal's teeth..... does no one understand that she represents why we need health care reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless you have government insurance (medical assistance ) or are wealthy you cannot afford to fix your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average working stiff has to choose between grocieries and dentistry. .......... .....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not to get off on a tangent, but health insurance doesn't cover dental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's always an "add-on." And the few times I decided to pay for the dental add-on, it turned out to benearly worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have to pay heaps of cash out of pocket to get much of anythingdone other than routine cleaning and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Crystal will need is a lot of cosmeticbonding or most likely a set of veneers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very VERY costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm just surprised AI hasn'tsprung for more than a whitening (her teeth were far more yellow during auditions) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But yes, she's just like the rest of us who simply can't afford expensive dental work, buthopefully her luck is changing and she'll have some solid cash after AI to take care ofherself and her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, if it doesn't bother her, it's not gonna bother me.I'd buy her record (or whatever) today.What song do you think Crystal should sing next? There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Michael I'm disappoint ed that you haven't heard Brandi Carlisle's song (it's amazing) and you seem to rank the value of each song by whether it was a pop hit or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Psst...the re's a lot of great "hits" and songs out there that aren't Top 40 ;-) I totally agree with you about Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm completely impressed with her...she is definitely head and shoulders above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could see her having a great career, but it won't be in Top 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shedoesn't sing poppy ballads; she is much more of a singer-son gwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She would seem to fit in with more the AAA and Alternativ e crowd.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER cindyfromfalls 08:28 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it Charity 10:48 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST COMMUNITY MODERATOR aznurse 12:49 AM on 3/11/2010 Permalink | Share it progressivewithaP 08:21 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it 59 Fans 2 Fans 62 Fans 2 Fans Hey progressiv ewithaP, my mention of chart history and other info about the songs is just to give some added value info to them, not any comment on their validity as tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just showing off my research ability and pile of books on pop music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check out my list of thebest CDs of 2009 to get a taste for what I like, which includes pop music, world, jazz,country, folk, gospel, rap, and more. http://www .huffingto npost.com/ michael-gi ltz/the-be st-cds-of- 2009----i_ b_462280.h tml And here's my list for the best CDs of the decade.http://www .huffingto npost.com/ michael-gi ltz/the-be st-cds-of- the-2000s_ b_472016.h tml I definitely agree Crystal is a triple A Americana sort of artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She won't live on Top 40 any more than Bonnie Rait (who had only 1 Top 10 hit on the pop charts, "Something To TalkAbout," which was written by John Hiatt, whose Bring The Family is one of my favoritealbums of the 80s and an Americana classic. :) Just showing off my research ability and pile of books on pop music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ah, Michael, hate to point this out but, Bonnie Raitt had the hit with John Hiatt's "Thing Called Love" -- not the tune you referenced .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whoops! :-) Point taken though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although I don't really get what all the fuss over Crystal isabout (yet?) she most certainly won't be a mainstream pop sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Michael, I did just check out your list and a lot of my favorite cds are on there :-) You certainly have varied taste and I'm happy to see it wasn't full of Lady Gaga,Beyonce, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Am I just totally missing the point of "American Idol?" Am I even watching the same show as everyone else? I thought Paige's rendition of "Smile" was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also think the judges should get off this "artist" thing they keep promoting as in "You have to find what kind of artist you are." Question.. .....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who was the better artist? Michael Jackson or Bob Dylan? Probably Dylan..... ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now who was the bigger star? Of course, it was MJ........ .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that he had more talent than Dylan it was just that Michael was the one you looked at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael was the one with the "Wow" factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, I miss Paula..... ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I miss Paula because she was the only performer who was judging these contestant s.HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:14 AM on 3/11/2010 Permalink | Share it DCDan 10:54 AM on 3/11/2010 Permalink | Share it progressivewithaP 04:05 PM on 3/11/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 04:10 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it59 Fans 18 Fans 59 Fans 16 FansWell, that's the fun of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeing something the judges don't see yet and yelling at the screen that they're clueless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though it's rare all four agree and are all wrong, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as long as you and other people keep voting for her, it doesn't matter what thejudges say about Paige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if she's around long enough, she's sure to score with them ifshe has the talent you believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every season the judges latch onto a catch phrase: this year it's knowing what kind of artist you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Originally , all the contestant s seemed to fit into a pop/r&amp;b mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then people who were clearly suited to country or rock or hip-hop broke through and it became more typicalfor them to appeal to fans of those genres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't mean you have to fit into a niche; itmeans you have to know what your strengths are and play to them, no matter what thegenre is that week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While few artists can compare to the influence of Bob Dylan, both he and Michael Jackson are huge, world-beat ing talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both were wildly influentia l.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To date, Michael jackson has sold more albums, by far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either one would have been a fantastic contestant .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIchael's all- around performer skills and Dylan's wit, ability to play to the camera and good-looks wouldhave served both well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both have the wow factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I miss Paula too and felt dumping her was a huge mistake. "Question. ......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who was the better artist? Michael Jackson or Bob Dylan?" The subject was American Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since you asked, there are many around the world who believe that MJ was far beyond Dylan, and it has nothing to do with "the wow factor".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everymajor artist has the wow factor, in spades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But these two have almost nothing in commonas performers .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like Dylan more, he's the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't, he isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Millions of fans prefer Taylor Swift to both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This kind of comparison is meaningles s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, just because some people like one artist and some like another doesn't meancomparison s can't be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people find ranking and lists meaningnle ss; I'll agree, though they're fun and mostly a way to point you in the direction of artistsyou may not have listened to yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But just because some kids like Taylor Swift andhave never paid attention to Dylan doesn't mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is in fact one of thetowering artists of the 20th century whose combinatio n of music and lyrics revolution ized rock and whose singing opened the doors for so many (and the ears of so many more).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's been a great radio deejay, a great memoirist, the subject of at least two classic documentar ies and produced a massive catalog of songs covered by more and more artists every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Jackson is an iconic artist and a world class performer, but his recorded output is far less substantia l and will ultimately be less influentia l.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can own Thriller and a greatest hits 2 CD set and have most everything you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael has three or four great albums; Dylan hadfour masterpiec es in just 22 months (Another Side, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's impossible to overestima te the seismic influence of Thriller and that album and his work around it will live forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But onlythe Beatles can match Dylan when it comes to overall impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Crystal is my favorite, I'm starting to think she's just A TAD arrogant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember she wasnever really into American Idol and only auditioned to get cash for her kid (not a bad reason).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butshe kind of thinks she's above it all, and though she's truly the best performer of the season, I wishshe were a bit more humble--th is is a HUGE break she's being given.HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:54 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it chitown 08:01 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:25 AM on 3/11/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER langstonhughesfan 03:45 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it59 Fans 4 Fans 164 Fans 59 Fans 6 FansI haven't seen anything too obnoxious in the attitude department from Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's certainly something she'll have to be careful of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she starts behaving like she's won, fanswill turn on her, talent or no talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly, I've just seen her trying to avoid pretending tobe something she's not, like not bouncing around on stage like the other gals at the end ofthe show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That ain't her and she'd look silly doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if even a fan begins to suspectshe's arrogant, she would do well to throw in some bashful, aw shucks comments and keepher head down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Likability matters as much as singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So glad you mentioned the similarity between Lacey and Didi--they both seem to use the sameaffected tone and I have trouble telling their voices apart--not strong enough voices in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iagree with anonimost that Didi sounded kinda sickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those earrings of Lilly's were LOL ridiculous .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They looked look crochet balls or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know what you mean, particular ly about Lacey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've been asking ourselves for several weeks why this girl made it into the Top 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is lovely looking, appears to have a sweetpersonalit y, etc., but is so out of tune throughout 90% of her songs, it was painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Granted, she has a lovely tone and that "quirky" thang going on that everyone seems so enamoredof this season, but I don't get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I will say, last night was the first time I've almost enjoyedher performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did very much enjoy Didi's performanc e last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When this girl finally gets past that whipped donkey backing singer thing and connects, she sounds wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her voice ringslike a bell in a clear mountain morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a little "eeek" about the song choice at first,but I loved her rendition and arrangemen t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High point for me on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the rest, Paige, poor girl, what can I say? She appears to be clueless how to use hervoice or where she is as an artist and I think we're going the way of Lil Rounds on this one.That performanc e last night - I expected any moment that she would burst into tears and bolt from the stage, it was that dreary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katelyn - sleep-indu cing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting !

Perhaps Randy was confusing "Breakaway " with "WALK Away" -- to me, KC's ultimate hit song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know singers can be autotuned to death, but when someone can't carry a tune (as Katie has failed to do for several weeks), I find it strange to refer to them as having a great radiovoice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then, Taylor Swift is the top-sellin g artist at the moment and she's no better, so what do I know? You're certainly right: Kara was referring to her tone, but I just don't hear itas anything special, on key or off.Permalink | Share it MiraMcB 03:38 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 05:00 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it DCDan 12:10 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:47 PM on 3/10/2010 Permalink | Share it MiraMcB 03:01 PM on 3/10/201051 Fans 59 FansI agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's doubtful they will ever have a very young contestant take the crown as American Idol for the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I worry that too much exposure and the rough critiquing couldeasily squelch a promising young person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking at poor Katie Stevens, we have anexample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've watched her confidence level come crashing down, week by week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Katie Stevens has a really good voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem I see with this girl is that the producers and judges have completely missed the mark on who this girl is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because of herage, they've pigeon-hol ed her in the teenie-wee ny bracket and want her to crank out teenie-wee ny song choices and performanc es.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IMHO, everything about this girl screams adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has the poise, tastes and voice of a30-somethi ng, not a 17 year old and I don't think that is necessaril y a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is just much more mature than her counterpar ts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunat ely, AI has been trying to force the round peg into the square box and she has been desperatel y trying to accomodate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, last night, I think Simon "got it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They shouldn't have tried to fixwhat wasn't really broken, but I have a feeling it's too late now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A shame for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I disagree the age should be raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allison Iraheta was one of the best singers to come out of AI and she was only 16/17 on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plenty of older singers weren't "ready,"either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think sometimes the wrong people make the top slots because of looks or a personal story rather than talent, and I agree with some of the other commenters that many get pigeon-hol ed into pre-concei ved styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A really good singer can sing the phone book, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree katie might (might!) have benefited from coming on Idol five years from now(or 10!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think any age can sing any type of song if they do it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe she'dbe better at the adult songs she favors with more experience .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FS4A is right about Alison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And let's not forget Jordin Sparks, who was 17 when she won it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hercareer is very much in the early stages but she has had very consistent successand some GREAT singles like "Battlefie ld" and "No Air."
