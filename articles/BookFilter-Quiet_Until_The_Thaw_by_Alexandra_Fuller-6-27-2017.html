Her parents and a lover inspired several more memoirs; now Fuller has embraced fiction with "Quiet Until The Thaw." Fuller is a white woman born in England and growing up in Africa, but says she felt a sense of coming home, of kinship among the Lakota OglalaSioux Nation peoples of South Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saying, in essence, yeah, she doesn't really care if you don't think this is "her" storyShare This Book About The Author Alexandra Fuller Alexandra Fuller was born in England in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1972, she moved with her family toa farm in southern Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She lived in Africauntil her midtwenties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1994, she moved toWyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $25.00 (Hardcover) Published: June 27, 2017 Publisher: Penguin Press Pages: 288 ISBN 10: 0735223343 ISBN 13: 9780735223349to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She weaves a tale spanning generations and wars, from Vietnam to Desert Storm; a story of cousins who respond to the unceasing burden of life in very different ways; a myth of beginnings and ends and beginning again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller gets deep under the skin of the world view of the Lakota, never ennobling them in some awful patronizing way but honoring them by telling this particular, unvarnished story of prison and murder and babies born in a storm and strong women and indifferentWhite People and sadness and...not joy exactly but endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lakota language and Lakota myth are woven throughout,along with a black-humored streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's funny and distinctive and utterly unlike anything Fuller has done before except likeher best work, it too feels risky and alive. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
