Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz 42 fans permalink The festival was notably front-loaded with major films often playing opposite each other with only one screening so only one chance to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, with The Road, I knew it would be out in theaters shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have the freedom to pick and choose what I want to see and if I knowa film is going to be in theaters, I might prefer to see something that doesn't have a distributor yet or something less well-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are literally hundreds offilms playing at Toronto and it's simply impossible to see them all or even all the "big" movies.Further, The Road already played at Venice so it wasn't going to make a stir at Torontobecause it wasn't "their" movie, ie. a movie that premiered there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I decided to see Dorian Cuba Small Business GOP MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:22 PM on 09/22/2009 See Michael Giltz's Profile See Michael Giltz's ProfileGray at 11:45 am at the same theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Road played in that theater immediately following, but if I wanted to be sure of a seat I would have either had to skip the earlier screening orleave in the middle of Dorian Gray in order to get into line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I chose instead to see two moviescompletely and The Trotsky, an interesting looking Canadian film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And to cap it off, thereviews in Venice for the film were mixed (with the NYTimes being especially brutal) so Ididn't feel the pressure to see it right away the way I did for Venice top prize winner Lebanon. douglet I'm a Fan of douglet permalink ...But you didn't bother to watch or review the most talked about film of the festival? That would beCoLLapse by filmmaker Chris Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was the most important film of the festival, by far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wherewere you? Jeez...too many books, man...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz 42 fans permalink Hi Douglet, Didn't "bother" to watch or review? I saw an average of three films a day over eight days, as well as filing 10 stories for various outlets,recording two podcasts (one of which discussed this very film with a critic who did see it) and appeared on TV to talk about the fest and the movies I liked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thebooks I read were just while standing in line for screenings or riding the subway, not in place of seeing films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And scheduling again: this film screened at the same time as Michael Moore's Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really liked American Movie and look forward to seeing this film as soon as Ican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like everyone who attends film festivals, I have a list as long as my arm of movies I wishI could have seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, Toronto was a great chance to catch somecannes films (like Dogtooth) that I missed there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just impossible to see 1/10th of themovies showing and invariably the one you miss gets tons of buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can't wait to see it. dictator1 I'm a Fan of dictator1 permalink I wish I had attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I heard this year was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are so many submissions that it is hard to getinto that festival,a s wella s sundance, SXSW, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I Were Dictator, how this would change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz 42 fans permalink I've never heard of a dictator focusing on making film festivals better,but if you seize power, I look forward to lots of positive changes!
