Am I taking my cue from the play, in whichevents kick into gear with Isaac's return? Or am I just reverting to a comfortably cis-gender viewpoint in a clearreflection of my patriarchal bias? Let the debates begin, a debate Mac would surely encourage and enjoy.I just wish the debates didn't overshadow the play or more exactly I wish there was more of a play for thedebates to interrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much here is intended to provoke but very little is grounded in character or consistent fromscene to scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One hates to bring up reality but it does intrude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The father Andy was physically abusive --Isaac in fact says one reason he joined the military was so he could learn how to stop his dad. (Spoiler alert:violence doesn't solve anything!) Yet does that justify Paige's cruel treatment in return, much less her fritteringaway both the modest family resources and her child's education? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Isaac tries to endthis cycle of abuse (and Max jumps in eagerly to take orders) it's all painted as some patriarchal betrayal, afeeling reinforced by the inevitable resort to violence we all anticipate for too long.12/16/2015Theater: "Hir" Here; Troubled "Th√©r√®se" | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=192239b8-e1a8-4cf8-912d-bc2f335ba766&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/5Isaac doesn't want to see his dad treated like an abused dog? Ok, but why does he egg on his dad's rebellionand delight in seeing the old man return to his abusive ways in one symbolic act? Because the play insists hemust, even though it flies in the face of what he know about Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why is Paige the aggrieved one at the endrather than equally damaged and unhinged? Because the play insists so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nielsen is a marvel at many points,giving a loopy energy to various showdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she can't do anything with several speeches, especially a finalone about why we send young men off to war that has literally nothing to do with anything that came before.It's all exhausting, right down to a complicated set of pulleys distracting one throughout the show just so thefamily can stage a brief shadow puppet play depicting the cruel abuse Paige suffered at the hands of herhusband, abuse both boys know so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He beat her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He raped her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when Isaac crosses a line, he too mustbe defeated by Paige to protect the brave new future she envisions, one in which apparently one form of tyrannywill be replaced by another.Max is lost in the shuffle, even as we sense how Max's future is being swallowed up by Paige's damaged needto be obeyed, whatever the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's almost wrong to try and sort out the conflicting nonsense of a play that hasmore fun and rings more true when gently tweaking the varied new terms of gender and an insistence on theirneed, even while honoring Max's journey.The characters can't be pinned down since they rarely make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige is flighty but smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isaac isexhausted, understanding and always throwing up from the nightmare of war...and yet is soon a regularmartinet, barking out orders at Max and going toe to toe with a mother he seemed to have every sympathy for,despite horror over the life they were living in his absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps only Arnold is consistent, a monster tied upin chains that bites the moment it gets a chance.Niegel Smith directs it all with empathy, eliciting performances from a cast that moment to moment can deliver.The costumes by Gabriel Berry and scenic design by David Zinn are appropriately out there, though theaudience applause for the tidying up that took place during the intermission seemed a tad bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it givesnothing away to say that there are holes in the walls of this starter home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the finale, they are "revealed" byPaige, further reminder of the terrible violence she and her children suffered at the hands of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butwe've been told about this dreadful violence from the first moments of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've seen it discussed anddebated and even dramatized in that shadow play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what possible impact could there be in "revealing" theseholes? Given her state of mind, her desire for chaos and Paige's determination to insist attention must be paid towhat they were exposed to, all we think is, "Why would she cover them up in the first place?" Like so much else,it doesn't make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am not very satisfied with this disjointed, rambling review but unfortunately itreflects the play I saw.TH√âR√àSE RAQUIN * out of **** ROUNDABOUT THEATRE COMPANY STUDIO 54No review could be more damning than the coughing and kvetching of the audience at the Roundabout from thefirst minute of this revival to the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They muttered, fought with one another, checked their phones, headed tothe bathrooms before the break, wandered around, chatted, muttered, coughed and coughed and coughedagain in apparently a restless desire to do pretty much anything but pay attention to the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the castpaused to make the seasonal request for donations to the worthy Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, starKeira Knightley said, "Thank you for being such a wonderful audience." I wanted to applaud: it was the bestacting of the night.But don't blame the audience (though there's no excuse for using your phone right up to the moment the playbegins.) From what I can gather, the Emile Zola potboiler Th√©r√®se Raquin has been staged countless times,filmed, musicalized (once by Harry Connick Jr.), turned into an opera and a TV miniseries and as far as I cantell, never terribly successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or should I say enduringly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the novel, some early stage or film adaptations12/16/2015Theater: "Hir" Here; Troubled "Th√©r√®se" | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=192239b8-e1a8-4cf8-912d-bc2f335ba766&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/5might have been commercial hits but they don't seem to have entered the canon as classics.The story was bold for its time: a woman cheats on her hateful husband with his rakish friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Determined to betogether, they off the inconvenient spouse but instead of happiness find themselves haunted by the memory oftheir crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zola wrote better, more important novels but the plot of this one has echoed down through the agesin many variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Postman Always Rings Twice comes to mind, as do many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this particulartelling seems to have little to offer but that initial, sizzling idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We know what's going to happen, we anticipateone or two awful ways the scheme might end (none of them happy) and one of those comes to pass and thenit's over.Knightley has command of the stage, but strikes just one note: a clenched, tightly wound misery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of ahissable husband and hateful mother-in-law, they are both reduced here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The talented Judith Light gives us arounded, actually rather nice mother-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She might be clueless and is certainly blind to the hatefulness of herson, but this is not a petty or mean woman.Similarly, Gabriel Ebert as the husband seems toothless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never read the novel or seen any other version ofthis story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when he and Th√©r√®se are first together, I actually thought they were siblings or even perhaps shewas a servant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's surely intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the extent of his character development is pushing her when no oneis around, like a naughty schoolboy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She soon thumps him back and is so decisive it's hard to imagine shewould ever be cowed by him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet this weak-willed, silly fool is supposed to literally haunt our murderousprotagonists? A weightier presence might be believable as a malevolent spirit that could not be shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ButEbert's husband wouldn't trouble the sleep of a mouse.When things go wrong in a production (or a crime, for that matter), they often go terribly wrong, as if one badturn on a journey means you can never reach your destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Evan Cabnet sticks with a plodding,inevitable approach from start to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's played as Greek tragedy when perhaps treating it like a juicymelodrama might add a little spice to the dour proceedings.And everything seems to be taken literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Th√©r√®se is haunted by the sound of her late husband's voicefrom beyond the grave...we hear her late husband's voice from beyond the grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the handsome devilLaurent (Matt Ryan) says being in his tiny attic apartment with a skylight makes him feel like he's among thestars, we later see a scene at said apartment where it is literally suspended alone among the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whenhusband and wife and best friend go boating, by god there's an actual rowboat and an expansive, boringly literallake of water for them to splash in.The set design by Beowulf Boritt features a confusing back wall that is maybe the sky or a concrete worldclosing in or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main set of a home flies up into the rafters and comes back down again so often itacts like a yo-yo, most notably for the scene of a funeral where it barely gets out of sight before seeming to plopback down again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Understandably, it seemed restless and dissatisfied, as if the set wanted to be anywhere elsebut onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One could understand -- and at least it didn't cough.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2 Parade in Concert at Lincoln Center ** 1/2 Hamilton at the Public ***</p>
