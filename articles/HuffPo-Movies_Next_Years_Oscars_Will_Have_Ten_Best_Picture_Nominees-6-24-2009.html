(Hmm, since that one triumphed, maybe it's not such a bad idea.) Obviously, they're still smarting from last year's ceremony when critically acclaimed and wildly popular movies like The Dark Knight and WALL- E weren't in the running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what do you think? Is this going to cheapen the prestige of being nominated for Best Picture? Or will it broaden the appeal of the Oscars and let the list of nomineesactually reflect the range of good movies shown throughout the year? To refresh your memory, the five nominees for Best Picture from 2008 were:The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button Frost/NixonMilkThe Reader Slumdog Millionare With of course, Slumdog becoming top dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now based strictly on total number of nominations in every category, if the top nominees became the top picks for Best Picture, the list last year might have been: The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button ChangelingThe Dark Knight Pals: Mischa Barton Struggled with Body Issues READ MORE Hailey Glassman Gushes over Jon Gosselin READ MORE Demi Lovato and Trace Cyrus Split READ MORE More Celebrity News at People.com Popular Stories on HuffPost Nude In NY: Where To Strut With No Stuff (NSFW PHOTOS, POLL) Believe it or not getting nude in NY isn't such a hard feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATE: 'Sprite Oral Sex Ad' Was Unauthorized(VIDEO) UPDATE 5:00 PM ET Thedirector of the fake Sprite ad, Max Issacson, has sent...BIG NEWS : Michael Jackson | Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 | Sports | Farrah Fawcett | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Hailey Glassman: Jon Gosselin Is A 'Great Cook,' Parents 'Love Him' More in Entertainment: Baldwin Bankruptcy...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MJ's Criminal Memorial...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollywood's Hot Old Men...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samantha Ronson Throws Lindsay Lohan's Clothes Into The Street Michael Giltz: Next Year's Oscars Will Have Ten Best Picture Nominees http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/next-years-oscars-will-ha_b_220253.html [7/21/2009 5:43:25 PM] digg it142 diggs Obama Calls On Bloggers To Keep Health CarePressure On Congress digg it22 diggs Palin Implicated In EthicsProbe digg it54 diggs Internal RNC Memo:"Engage In Every Activity"To Slow Down Health CareReform digg it30 diggs Jeff Sharlet RevealsDisturbing Details AboutConservative "C StreetHouse" Organization OnRachel Maddow Show(VIDEO) www.REI.com/FindOut Comments 5 Pending Comments 0 Sarah Jessica Parker And Matthew Broderick's Night...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Cruise And Kids Join Beckham Family...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samantha Ronson Throws Lindsay Lohan's Clothes Into...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kate Major: Jon Gosselin's Night Out With...Doubt Frost/Nixon Milk The ReaderRevolutionary RoadSlumdog Millionaire WALL-E Is that a more exciting list? Of course, nominations don't mean you will automatically make it on the list for Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other acclaimed films that might have made it onto the Best Picture list include: Happy-Go-Lucky Iron Man Waltz With Bashir The Wrestler If the list means popular and acclaimed films like WALL-E and The Dark Knight are in the mix, it'll be a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it just means more art house films like Doubt and Revolutionary Road, the list will rightly be seen as more of the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next year, if UP is not nominated for Best Picture, there will rightly be an outcry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost as loud an outcry if something commercially successful but godawful like Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen does make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what do you think about this radical change by the Oscars?
