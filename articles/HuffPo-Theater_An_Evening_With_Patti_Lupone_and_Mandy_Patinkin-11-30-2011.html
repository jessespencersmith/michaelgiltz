Even better is Merrily and the marvelous finale built around Carousel .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy FOLLOW US Celebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (26) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Hillcoat Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben Cardin Harry Shearer Jeffrey SachsHOT ON THE BLOG Like 102 Posted: 11/30/11 11:55 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Entertainment Alerts Sign UpSPONSOR GENERATED POST Recommend 629 Like 6kElectronic Dance Music Political Hollywood The Avengers One Direction The Choice More Log in Create AccountIn between we get numerous other tunes, with Patinkin reprising his Follies success "The God-Why- Don't-You-Love-Me Blues" and Lupone delivering a more measured "Everything's Coming Up Roses." They delight in numerous comic numbers like "Baby It's Cold Outside" and the novelty tune "April In Fairbanks" (unfamiliar to me, it's from New Faces Of 1956 ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This sort of thing can be tossed together in a minute but they've crafted it with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patinkin subtly and graciously showcases Lupone throughout, giving himself goofier turns a la "I Won't Dance." Of course they tackle Evita , done in a smartly straightforward manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He puts his arm around her and talks about how they met on that show and became fast friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patinkin then turns out a fiery, focused "Oh What A Circus" while she sits on the side and applauds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They switch and he admires Lupone as sheacts her way through "Don't Cry For Me Argentina." As with several other points in the show, theaudience is raptly quiet when these two command the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost as an aside, Lupone delivers a nicelymodulated, moving "In Buddy's Eyes" shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the finale really is Carousel , in which these two people known so well for their distinctive, career- making voices remind us what exceptional actors they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patinkin is a would-be menacing Billy Bigelow who can't faze a more world-weary Julie Jordan, as embodied so nicely here by Lupone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, they're playing kids but the emotions of warily reaching out to another are universal and timeless and for a scene or two, it works wonderfully. "If I Loved You" and "You're A Queer One, Julie Jordan" are gems delivered beautifully, but I remember the emotions they evoke so deftly in the acting moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lupone tears up on a dime during Merrily and here her character's instant ability to see into Billy's awkward, confused heart is quite moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AndPatinkin delivers the commencement address from the finale of that show; it's advice to students andindeed anyone trying to live their life with purpose and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He captures that moment so simply anddirectly and touchingly, it breaks your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the greatness of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein in a nutshell: adisarming truhfulness that slips past your defenses with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corny in the hands of amateurs; moving inthe hands of pros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lupone's trumpet of a voice is more muted now; Patinkin's swoops and moans and various voices from deep bass to high falsetto as familiar as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acquired tastes? Of course, but we've been acquiring thattaste for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't break new ground or work wonders during this low-key, charming evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They simply get on stage and perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all they've ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Chinglish * 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Godspell ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** GOP Candidate Compares Pregnancy From Rape To What?
