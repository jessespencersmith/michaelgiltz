                <p>First White; Stoneware and Shino Glaze, 20" x 25", 2005 Horse Sense Artist and educator Peggy Zask shares her love of all things equine with her students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Giltz STUDENTS AT the Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, CA, do not have to struggle to figure out how to create a project that pleases artist/educator Peggy Zask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the subject includes a flowing mane and about 1,000 pounds of pulsating muscle, chances are they are on the right track. "I battled the horse stigma fbr a long time," relates Zask, who lives on the edge of a nature preserve overlooking the Pa- cific in Rancho Palos Verdes. "I draw horses constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I started sculpting them and I decided: This is what I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I keep trying to frgure out what is this symbolizing? Why am I doing this? I just crave the perfection and expression and the beauty and spirit of a horse." Zask, lvho seerns fhted to teach in a school where the mas- cot is a lvlustang, appreciates the resltrgence of funding for the .rrts under Gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ar nold Schwarzenegger. "We're getting huge ;-rmounts of money fi-om Califbrniir because Schwarzenegger decided to bring the arts back, so we're fightir-rg over lour r;hare].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's allowing ns to hire elementary school art teachers, rvhich makes a big diff-erence ." Always firing up a clay sculpttrre rrnd inspiring her students rver the possibilities of art, sl're l-ras rvot'ked with str.rdents to cre- :rte a massive mural (10' x 50' feet rvicle) clecorating one lvall of sHow_crRculr (65 spRrruc zo'olthe school and adorned with countless stallions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her love of equestrian art has also driven her to found and curate the an- nual Spirit of the Horse exhibit every spring in her town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is only fitting since Zask grew up around the animals. "My dad was a real estate agent in the'70s when it was a good thing," the artist explains. "My mom had the Rolling Hills General Store-a little country store-so I helped her with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We owned three horses and we had a half acre and cor- rals and a barn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My first horse was Poco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was about 30 years old and really slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I was seven they pr,rt me on him, and I went on from there." Now her Iove for the creatures has been passed on to Zask's daughter. "My daughter has a thoroughbred named Mikey fnamed after MikeyWay from of the rock band My Chemical Romance] and she's into jumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's on the equestrian team at her high school and she's taking it to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, it's scary," the proud mother laughs, "especially jumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can barely watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're right on the edge of a nature preserve so we have a lot of land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a barn that's parent-run, but the teenage girls keep their horses there and do all the care and maintenance and management. 'Are you familiar with the Pony Club? It started in England but it's here in America too, and we belong to the Portuguese Bend Pony Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They compete against each other, but it's more of a nurturing, responsibility, growth and goal-oriented Igroup] than competing in big shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These girls, when they get to the top ratings, they know as much as any veterinarian about caring for these animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a good organization; nry d:rughter loves it." Zask prefers to draw from memory instead of photographs or live models when creating her sculptures. "l just finished A detail of the mural Mustang Surf by Zask and students; 10'x 50', 20O3-2OO4one today," details Zask, who maintains a website at peg- gyzask.com. "It's maybe thlee f-eet tall by fbur feet long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I built it in pieces, and I'm wiring it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My first horses were really cautious becar-rse I dicln't know if I conld clo their long skinny Iegs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're a churllenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love llre ch.rllenge ol getting them to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I feel like my ilttilude nrust c()nre throrrr,lr these horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This lnev,' u,ork] has the legs of mv daughter's horse because I love his legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the lirst tl-ror- oughbred I've ever been arounci ii:j I'tl\r (l\\rlt horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a jr.rmping horse, and he's got thesc reailv tl'rin, tl-ril.r legs." \44ratever horse Zask is irror"ttttl ii-rton-rls her scnlptr-rres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And whenever yoll are alound Zl:[.' tlu.rges tri these creilttlres are never far behind. "If you look b1' the phone, vt--lL ll -i": '-l r ln'itrgs tlf horses, admits Zask. "I draw compulsivr:li'." .&amp;</p>
