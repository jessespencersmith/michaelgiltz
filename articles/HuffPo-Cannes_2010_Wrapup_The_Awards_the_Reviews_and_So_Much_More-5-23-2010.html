A: No, absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another question, about the admittedly tiny increase in the tiny UK lottery funding of film up to 10 million pounds and whether that was good prompted Leigh to say, "That's another stupid question" or some such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, his gruffness and no-b.s. meter makes me want to interview him all the more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be a challenge and a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST QUOTE ABOUT SEX AND VIOLENCE IN FILMThe film company Wild Bunch quickly and forcefully acted to squash any impression that it was getting all Harvey Weinstein on director Nikita Mikhalkov because the Russian's cut of his movie Burnt By The Sun 2: Exodus was more than half an hour shorter than the version that played in his home country. (Mind you, it was still 2 and a half hours long.) But what really infuriated the suits at Wild Bunch was thesuggestion that they would cut a topless scene of a beautiful young actress. "We've never cut a topless scene in any film," Vincent Maraval told Screen International. "At Wild Bunch, we love nudity and blood." WORST EXAMPLE OF BEING TRUE TO FORM Mick Jagger kept everyone on rock and roll time for the screening of the documentary film Stones in Exile, which started almost an hour late, throwing off our schedule for the rest of the evening, when almost every other screening runs like clockwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, his French was charming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So all will be forgiven if he'll just let them release Cocksucker Blues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST OVERHEARD CONVERSATIONOne of my roommates was on Skype having a video chat with his 9 year old daughter back in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daughter: Daddy, you're seeing a lot of films, right? Dad: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daughter: So...have you seen Marmaduke yet? Dad: No, honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marmaduke didn't make it past the selection committee at Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DISCUSSION OF CURSING IN FILM From a Hollywood Reporter Q&amp;A with Stephen Frears about his well-received comedy Tamara Drewe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hollywood Reporter: The word c--t is in the film on at least two notable occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it a word you feel emboldens a script? Frears: You're allowed two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would have liked three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you only have two you get an '15' certificate for a comedy from the British Board of Film Classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have three, you get the next one up, an '18.' We had to decide which one of the three to remove and when I saw the cut with one taken out I didn't notice it had gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which perhaps speaks to it not being necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As to whether or not it emboldens a script, I don't think it makes a blind bit of difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a word I feel necessitates debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SHOW OF ANGER BY A FRIEND OF THE DIRECTOR In a screening of the three hour long film The Autobiography of Nicolae Ceausescu, , seated in the area reserved for people associated with the film was an elderly woman, who one imagined was either the mother of the director or, who knows, a relative of Ceausescu himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Invariably, people don't stay for anentire film, especially one that's so long: they may have a meeting to attend or an interview to conduct and simply wanted to get an idea of what the film was like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But every time someone stood up to leave, this woman would gesture with fury at them for daring to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the more people that left (it wasn't aparticularly well-reviewed film, I'm afraid), the angrier she would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bets were placed, but unfortunately she didn't confront anyone or trip them up as they walked by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WORST BOOK TO BRING TO A GREGG ARAKI FILM I always bring a book along to every screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half an hour in line or spent seated in a theater is just another chance to do some reading as far as I'm concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't often think about the combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I went to a screening of Gregg Araki's pansexual, sci-fi, cult crazy, lesbian witch college sex comedy Kaboom .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People were unnerved, amused or just plain discombobulated by the book I was reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So okay, The Cistercian World: Monastic Writings of the Twelfth Century probably did seem a little odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you think an audience waiting to see a film about vengeful lesbian witches and the mystical son of a cult leader with psychic abilities who must save the world from nuclear annihilation would be a little more open-minded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane Krakowski Reveals Baby Bump Bristol Palin's New RadioGig?
