                <p>Making new cD was hardly child,s play for kids music star lf you think recording an album of children's music is all lsw-e-etness and light and fun and games, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I Kids music superstar Laurie Berkner,s latest CD _ - "Rocketship" is her fifth CD - and the first in six years for Berkner, a mainstay on the Noggin children's channel, especiallythe series "Jack,s Big Muiic Show," onwhich shehas already performed some of the tunes from the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to her stress, in a good way, was the fact Berkner was now a mother, which meant she was working a lot less with children while trying to write music kids woirld enloy. "It's been a long time, and I have less daily interaction - with lots of kids," explains Berkner. .,I have much more daily interaction with one kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It,s funny - I worked with so many more adults and so many fewer kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I actually found that somewhat stressful. "When I'm working with the kids, it's like, .Oh. vou like this? Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one will be fun.'you can feel it working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I felt like I was depending on myself and the reactions oT adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm glad adults like [the CD].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if kids don't like it, no adult is going to buy it.,', Berkne4, 39, began her music careerwith choirs. then r segued into playing music at day-care centers and pre_ ; schools. r She performed in a rockband called l,ois Lane. but it : wasn't until she started writing songs for children that the , funes reallybeganto flow. i Now, kids are teaching her an important lesson: Share ; your toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time, Berkner has recorded origi_ : na1 solgs written byherband members (Susie Lampert andI Adam Bernstein), as well as having a lot more input from ; herproducer. , 'Yeah, I stopped being a control freak," laughs Berkner.' "I've been working on that and take it seriously, That feels good to me - to really take seriously what I'm doing so thaf otherpeople feel that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then have as much fun as I can with it.; MichaetGittzLaurie Berkner says being a mother gave her less time to spend with kids while creating.Rocketship."</p>
