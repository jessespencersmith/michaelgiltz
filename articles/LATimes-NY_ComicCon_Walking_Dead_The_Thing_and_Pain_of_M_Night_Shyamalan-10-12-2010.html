"The Walking Dead" (AMC) New York ComicCon continues to grow by leaps and bounds and that was apparent this past weekend — especially Saturday – when you couldn’t find enough personal space at the Jacob K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Javits Convention Center to safely swing a lightsaber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, the venue on the far west side of midtown Manhattan was relatively navigable, but the next day saw a massive line for badge pick-up and a crush of humanity (and possibly some extraterrestrials) that made it difficult to get your geek on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There remains one crucial difference between New York and the more famous San Diego expo with the similar name — the movie and TV talent level hasn’t reached critical mass yet at the East 0 0 7« PREVIOUS POST | NEXT POST » E-mail Print Read Later Latest MOVIES ANIME TOP 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘FullmetalAlchemist’ lead 2010 s best » TV VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’ completes the Jedi joke trilogy » COMICS Frank Miller’s Christmas wish… » GAMES Guillermo del Toro: inSANE video gamewill be ‘immersive, powerful’ Lovecraftianadventure » @LATHerocomplex ANIME TOP 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ lead 2010 s best http://lat.ms/flziIV -8 hours ago ‘Tron: Legacy’ is a heritagemoment for Steven Lisberger http://lat.ms/ic0ilN -10 hours ago VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’completes the Jedi joke trilogy http://lat.ms/gkDx2A -11 hours ago VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’ completes the Jedi joke trilogy »Curse of the Spider-Man?

Fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lambasting? Not so fun. “I’d be in a record store,”said Shyamalan, “and a kid would say, ‘That’s M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Night Shyamalan.’” Shyamalan imitated asullen teenager buddy saying, “Yeah, but ‘Unbreakable’ SUCKED!” The filmmaker also told astory about one fan who showed up at his office and demanded to see the director because — the guy insisted — he was the real David Dunn (the character Bruce Willis played in the film) and was ready to join forces with Shyamalan to fight evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a more serious note, Shyamalan said he has toyed with more ideas set in the ‘Unbreakable’ universe or even doing a direct sequel,reporting that actors Willis and Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson are game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing official is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMETIMES A SIDEKICK ISN’T JUST A SIDEKICK : With gay bashings and suicides dominating headlines, the Con offered some welcoming, positive news for gay fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three panels addressed gay topics, from writing LGBT characters to the gay mangas that are huge sellers in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One all-star panel Saturday night — which attracted a standing room only crowd — was moderated by Jeff Krell (creator of Jayson ) and featured Howard Cruse (the creator of the classic graphic novel “ Stuck Rubber Baby “), Abby Denson (“ High School Confidential “), Joan Hilty (of DC’s Vertigo), Phil Jimenez (of DC), Dan Parent (the man behind the first openly gay teen in the Archie Comics universe) and Tim Fish (“ Cavalcade Of Boys “).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was also an auction on Sunday for Maddie’s Fund , which supports outreach to gay teens at the LGBT Center of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fish was one of the small-press people who reported that sales were good and that he loves the NYC gathering’s emphasis on comics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KrellDC Deadpool Dean Haspiel Deborah Vankin Dexter Dick Tracy digital comics Disney District 9 Doctor Who Dollhouse Don Cheadle Doonesbury Douglas Adams Dracula Drawn &amp; Quarterly Dwayne Johnson E3 EC Ed Brubaker Edward James Olmos Eli Roth Emily the Strange Emma Stone Emma Watson Fantagraphics Fantastic Four Flash Gordon Forbidden Planet Forrest J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ackerman Frank Beddor Frank Darabont Frankenstein Frank Frazetta Frank Miller Fringe G.I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe G4 gaming Gary Kurtz Geek Gift Guide Gene Roddenberry Geoff Boucher Geoff Johns George Lucas George Reeves George Romero Gerard Way Gerrick D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kennedy ghostbus Ghostbusters Gina McIntyre Godzilla Gore Verbinski Grant Morrison greatest american hero Green Arrow Green Hornet Green Lantern Greg Braxton Guillermo del Toro Guy Ritchie H.P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovecraft Harrison Ford Harry Potter Harvey Pekar Hayao Miyazaki Heath Ledger Hellboy Henry Selick Hero Complex Film Festival horror hp lovecraft Hugh Jackman Hulk Human Target Hunger Games I, Spy Ian McKellen Inception Indiana Jones Iron Man Isaac Asimov J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abrams J.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rowling J.R.R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tolkien Jack Black Jack Kirby Jake Gyllenhaal James Bond James Cameron James McTeigue jason statham Jay West Jeff Bridges Jeph Loeb Jerry Bruckheimer jet li Jevon Phillips Jim Henson Jim Starlin Joe Johnston Joel Silver Joe Sacco Joe Simon John Carpenter John Horn John Lasseter John Milius John Noble Johnny Depp Jonah Hex Jon Favreau Joseph Kosinski Joss Whedon Joyce Farmer Jurassic Park Karate Kid Katniss Everdeen Kenneth Branagh Kenneth Turan Kevin Smith Kick Ass King Kong Kristen Stewart L.A. events Last Airbender League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Lego Leonard Nimoy Let Me In Liesel Bradner Lobo Lon Chaney Lord of the Rings Lost M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Night Shyamalan Mad Magazine manga Marc Guggenheim Marc Webb Maria Elena Fernandez Mark Milian Mark Waid Martin Campbell Marvel Mary McDonnell Maryhinted that an announcement about his ongoing involvement with Archie Comics and the openly gay character Kevin Keller would be coming soon. (Krell started drawing his strip “Jayson” in 1983 specifically because he loved Archie Comics but didn’t see himself reflected in the stories.) Frank Darabont (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) ZOMBIES!: AMC’s “The Walking Dead” was the final splashy event at ComicCon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a change, the NYC audience got more than San Diego, six minutes versus the three minutes shown on the West Coast. “Why not show it all?” shouted a fan. (You just can’t please some people.) Producer Gale Anne Hurd (“ The Terminator ,” “Aliens “) said AMC proved the ideal partner for the production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hurd described calling a contact at the cable channel behind award-winning dramas“Mad Men ” and “ Breaking Bad ” to ask if AMC would ever consider doing an adaptation of a graphic novel, like, for example “The Walking Dead?” When the executive on the other line responded, “You mean Robert Kirkman’s ‘The Walking Dead?’” Hurd said she was soastonished that she stared at the phone for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After she related the anecdote, Kirkmanturned to her and said with astonishment, “I hadn’t heard that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really ?” Kirkman wrote the fourth episode of the series, which debuts on Halloween, and said, “It was fun to go back andspend more time with these characters because a lot of them are dead in the comic book.” Theaudience applauded that the series was being filmed in Super 16 (that’s the format that made thezombies look the coolest, Hurd said) and laughed when director Frank Darabont ( “The Shawshank Redemption,” “The Mist” ) said he couldn’t believe some of the things they were being allowed to put on the air. (He also casually mentioned having dinner once withGeorge Romero, Stephen King and Quentin Tarantino .) Darabont did have the perfect response to one young woman who complained that she couldn’t persuade her friends to read “The Walking Dead” series because they dismissed it as just “more zombies” and wanted to know what she should say to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Darabont responded solemnly, “I would execute one of your friendsas an example to the others.” The audience roared with laughter. – Michael Giltz RECENT AND RELATED Singer: “First Class” has to be about Prof X &amp; Magneto “X-Men” director: Super-hero genre “mined to death”Snyder: I lay awake imagining Superman flight scenesMcNamara Matt Damon Matthew Vaughn Matt Smith Merch Metropolis Michael Bay Michael Chabon Michael Ordoña Mike Mignola Mike Richardson Milla Jovovich MMORPG Moebius monsters motion comics Muppets Music Neal Adams Neil Gaiman Neill Blomkamp Nicolas Cage Ninjas Noelene Clark No Ordinary Family Nosferatu Olivia Munn Olivia Wilde Pan's Labyrinth Panzer 88 Patrick Day Patrick Stewart Paul Newman Paul Pope Paul W.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anderson Percy Jackson and the Olympians Peter Jackson Philip K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick Piranha 3D Pirates of the Caribbean Pixar Planet of the Apes Pokemon Politics Power Rangers Predator Prince of Persia promobox promobox-lede Quentin Tarantino Quizzam R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crumb R.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stine Rachel Abramowitz Random silliness Ray Bradbury Rebecca Keegan Reed Johnson Religion review Richard Donner Rick Riordan Ridley Scott RIPD Robert Abele Robert Downey Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Heinlein Robert Pattinson Robert Rodriguez Robert Zemeckis Robin Hood Robot Chicken Rocketeer Roger Corman Ron Howard Ron Moore Russell Crowe Ryan Reynolds Sam Mendes Sam Raimi Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson Sam Worthington Sandman Saw Scarlett Johansson Scott Pilgrim vs the World Scott Timberg Scream 4 Scream Awards Seth Rogen sex Sgt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rock Sherlock Holmes Shrek Signature Series Sigourney Weaver Simpsons Sin City Six Million Dollar Man Smallville Smurfs special effects Spider-Man Spiderman Stan Lee Stan Winston Stargate Star Trek Star Wars Stephenie Meyer stephen j. cannell Stephen King Steve Ditko Steve Niles Steven Moffat Steven Spielberg Steven Zeitchik Sucker Punch Super Superman Susan Carpenter Susan King Suzanne Collins Swamp Thing SXSW SyFy Sylvester Stallone Tarzan Taylor Lautner Television Terminator The Avengers The Cape The Crow The Dark Knight The Dark Knight Returns The Dark Tower The Day the Earth Stood Still The Event The Exorcist The Expendables The Flash The Green Hornet The Green Lantern The Hobbit The Hunger Games The Lone Ranger The Losers The Matrix films theme parks The Phantom The Prisoner The Spirit The Vampire Diaries TheWalkingDead The Walking Dead The Wolf Man Thor Tim Burton Tintin Todd Martens Tom Felton Tony DiTerlizzi Torchwood toys Toy Story Trailers Transformers Tron True Blood Twilight Twilight Zone Umbrella Academy Underworld Up V vampires Vertigo V for Vendetta videobox_lede video games video_box Virgin Comics Walking Dead Wally Wood Wanted war comicsComment as a Guest, or login: Comments by There are no comments posted yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the first one!Is Kraven the villian for new Spidey film?
