                <p>More Create Blog Sign In SUNDAY, MARCH 31, 2019 The 44th Annual IRA Awards -- "Capernaum" Triumphs The 44st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2018 Releases The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society launched in 1976 when it proudly named Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon the best film of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officially known as the New York Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs -- they are more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics and more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies released commercially in New York City in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs are also proud to announce a change in its rule to determine eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rolling with the times and acknowledging how IRA members and the world are accessing more movies in more ways than ever before (streaming, VOD, DVD, theatrical and so on), the IRAs adopted a new standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eligibility for 2020 voting: If a movie becomes available to IRA members in any way on any platform (theatrical distribution, DVD, on demand, streaming, etc.) in the previous calendar year, a member may vote for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Festival play alone, however, does not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Spielberg may be freaked out over Netflix, but we've seen the future and it's actually the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rest assured, IRA members love nothing more than heading to their local multiplex, art house or drive-in, sit in a darkened space with a crowd of strangers and watch a new or classic film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Access on your TV is great, but the silver screen is greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without further ado, the IRA goes to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best Picture: Capernaum Best Director: Nadine Labaki for CapernaumMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–¼ 2019 (31) â–º June (1) â–º May (9)Best Actor: Joaquin Phoenix for Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot; Mary Magdalene; The Sisters Brothers; You Were Never Really Here Best Actress: Sakura AndÃ´ for Shoplifters Best Supporting Actor: Brian Tyree Henry for Hotel Artemis , If Beale Street Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, White Boy Rick, Widows Best Supporting Actress: Regina King for If Beale Street Could Talk Best Nonfiction Film: Won't You Be My Neighbor? Best Screenplay: Barry Jenkins for If Beale Street Could Talk Best Cinematography: Alfonso Cuaron for Roma Best Production Design: Eugenio Caballero for Roma Best Score/Use Of Music: Nicholas Britell for If Beale Street Could Talk Best Editing: Nick Fenton, Chris Gill and Julian Hart for American Animals Best Costumes: Caroline Eselin for If Beale Street Could Talk Sominex Award (The Movie That Put Us To Sleep): On The Basis Of Sex Dramamine Award (The Movie That Made Us Sick): The Favourite Mechanical Actress: Tilda Swinton for Suspiria Mechanical Actor: Rami Malek and his dentures for Bohemian Rhapsody In 2018, the IRAs had a flood of new members, perhaps the most ever in one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Illness and life prevented all four members from returning again, but happily two braved this querulous, quarrelsome group a second time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In all, twelve members were present physically or virtually (IRA member Greg beamed in by satellite, a la Max Headroom), with the titular IRA member Ira maintaining his non- voting status on the current year but weighing in boldly with support for the rule change on eligibility while offering gnomic, pointed and hard to argue with comments when moved to do so. (His favorite film of all-time? Vertigo! ) In short, eleven members weighed in on the films of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The atmosphere -- to this observer -- was a tad more collegial than usual, which certainly isn't in the IRA tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are the new members too nice? Will they become more embittered and venomous as life crushes their hopes and aspirations or the repeated asinine voting of others weighs more heavily on their cinematic conscience? We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now a blow-by-blow description of the night, in order of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We begin, as always, with th4e category of Best Costumes and the first voter of the night, Ira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was dressed nattily in suspenders but passed on voting in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRA goes to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST COSTUME 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caroline Eselin for If Beale Street Could Talk -- 34 pts. (out of a possible 55 pts.)â–º April (10) â–¼ March (5) The 44th Annual IRA Awards -- "Capernaum" Triumphs...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: A Too-Proud "Ain't Too Proud" THEATER: "Ain't No Mo'" Takes Off With Talent and ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "Kate, Do I Have Your Consent To Ask For ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "White Noise" Yearns To Provoke â–º February (1) â–º January (5) â–º 2018 (33) â–º 2017 (6) â–º 2016 (2) â–º 2015 (17) â–º 2014 (2) â–º 2013 (5) â–º 2012 (17) â–º 2011 (15) â–º 2010 (10) â–º 2009 (43) â–º 2008 (86) â–º 2007 (781) â–º 2006 (2412) â–º 2005 (5)2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vogt for Crazy Rich Asians -- 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandy Powell for The Favourite and Mary Poppins Returns -- 20 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mitchell Travers for Eighth Grade, The Strange Ones --17 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jenny Eagan for American Animals, Hostiles, Widows-- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POINT OF ORDER: This year eleven ballots were in play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a top score for each nominee of 5 pts, the maximum any one nominee could achieve in any category was 55 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Half the fun of the IRAs is trying to figure out in advance which films might be contending, politic for your favorite (or favourite) and block the one you like least by talking it down or simply ignoring the offending flick altogether. (That film? Hardly worthdiscussing, you sniff.) This year, I imagined the widely admired IfBeale Street Could Talk and the contentious drama The Favourite might battle it out all the way to Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beale Street easily took the first prize of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The great Sandy Powell was most definitely honored for her work on The Favourite. (The IRAs are suckers for historical costume dramas, esp in tech awards, just like anyone else.) Mary Poppins Returns was not liked even on a tech level by most (those anachronistic bathing suits!), with one notable admirer.Similarly, Mitchell Travers earned votes for Eighth Grade (that bathing suit!) not the little seen sci-fi flick The Strange Ones, which also had one admiring viewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Jenny Eagan was lauded essentially forAmerican Animals , though her work on the period western Hostiles and the crime drama Widows certainly demonstrates her versatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In general, a nominee is lauded for all their work in a calendar year unless voters specifically exclude work on one or more films -- this, but not that! -- when voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST EDITING 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nick Fenton, Chris Gill and Julian Hart for American Animals -- 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders for If Beale Street Could Talk -- 24 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bob Murawski and Orson Welles for The Other Side Of The Wind -- 15 pts.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hirokazu Kore-eda for Shoplifters, The Third Murder -- 11 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Da-won Kim and Hyun Kim for Burning -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: When editing was added to the list of categories that the IRAsvote on, some concern arose it might be dominated by nonfictionfilms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though many docs have a script, by nature they are often discovered after filming has ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, for the second year in a row no nonfiction film made the editing list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But arguments continue aboutthis addition, for change comes slowly and contentiously to the IRAs.Isn't it really the screenplay of American Animals that's being honored here, wondered some? And how could the strongly liked doc Minding The Gap (which was shot over many years and clearly didn't even exist until its brilliant editing took place) not appear here at all? No onedisputed the lure of casting another vote for all-time great Orson Welles: surely the task of pulling together The Other Side Of The Wind after decades of post-production hell was a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad the film they cobbled together was such a mess, harrumphed others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCORE/USE OF MUSIC 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nicholas Britell for If Beale Street Could Talk -- 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marcin Masecki for Cold War -- 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne Nikitin for American Animals -- 16 pts. 4. (tie) Aretha Franklin for Amazing Grace --10 pts. (tie) Michel Legrand for The Other Side Of The Wind -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The category of Best Score was recently renamed Best Score/Use Of Music to accommodate the endless ways in which filmsmake use of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year is a good example why the renaming is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Beale Street has a classic film score that boldly dominates the audio mix. (It was my favorite aspect of a film I didn't care for as much as others.) But it also made significant and effectiveuse of period jazz and pop tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cold War has no original score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it revolves entirely around music, drawing on jazz standards and Polish folk tunes, re-arranging them for state-approved festivals and then re-imagining them again for a jazz trio fronted by a female singerand so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credited winner is Marcin Masecki, responsible for thearrangements used in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet clearly writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski embedded music in this film's DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ignoring it just because it had no composer for a traditional score would be foolish.The just-deceased legend Michel Legrand grabbed his last IRA nodjust in time with the Orson Welles project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Aretha Franklin?Well, no one was more responsible for how music was used in thedocumentary/concert film Amazing Grace than the late queen of soul herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eugenio Caballero for Roma -- 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justin Thompson for Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse -- 20 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BenoÃ®t Barouh, Marcel Slawinski and Katarzyna Sobanska- Strzalkowska for Cold War -- 19 pts. 4. (tie) Keiko Mitsumatsu for Shoplifters -- 10 pts. (tie) Gary Williamson for Paddington 2 -- 10 pts.NOTE: Ah, Roma! Admired so much by certain IRA members, they discussed how its overall structure was repeated in individual scenes -- heck, they could teach it to their film students, if only it were shorter. (A practical consideration.) Its evocation of director Alfonso Cuaron'schildhood won it the top prize for production design. (That garage! Sonarrow! The dog poop! So...voluminous!) Many were wowed by the animated groundbreaker Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The look of that film (which combined multiple styles of animation along with a comic book aesthetic) might well be its best bet at an IRA yet it fellshort here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Paddington 2 is not just a whimsical choice: its adherents spoke strongly for the look, the vocal performance of Ben Whishaw as the lovable bear (not to mention his fine work on Mary Poppins Returns and the film in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron boldly declared Paddington 2 the best film of the year and anyone who disagreed risked finding themselves in an abandoned train station somewherefar far away without even a name-tag to help them find their wayhome BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alfonso Cuaron for Roma -- 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joshua James Richards for The Rider -- 23 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lukasz Zal for Cold War -- 21 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kyung-pyo Hong for Burning -- 19 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jimmy Chin for Free Solo -- 17 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Another win for Roma! Might it take on If Beale Street at the end of the night, alongside the rising buzz for American Animals ? I assumed if The Rider won anything it would be this award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this won't be the last time we hear from that genuinely independent film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attention here bode well for both Burning (very well shot, but this was not a one-and-done for some great camerawork) and Free Solo,climbing its way towards contention in Nonfiction Film.Cinematography proves a rich, world-spanning category indicative ofthe wide net cast by the IRAs when it chooses to honor films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Ican't help noticing the gorgeously shot If Beale Street doesn't win, place OR show in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sign of weakness? Finally? FOOD ALERT: Pizza is ordered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCREENPLAY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barry Jenkins for If Beale Street Could Talk -- 22 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hirokazu Kore-eda for Shoplifters, The Third Murder -- 15 pts. 3. (tie) Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty for Can You Ever Forgive Me? -- 13 pts. (tie) ChloÃ© Zhao for The Rider --13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman for Spider-Man: Into TheSpiderverse -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: My faint hope that If Beale Street was beginning to fade (no points for cinematography?) are immediately dashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It triumphs for Best Screenplay, despite my quickly pointing out to potential votersthat author James Baldwin would not be showing up to accept the award on Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jenkins' behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More worrisome, when BealeStreet wins tonight it's usually been winning big, as it does here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kore- eda had a banner year with not one but two widely liked moviesreleased commercially in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who saw both insistThe Third Murder is better, but most IRAnians only saw Shoplifters , which snagged the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May andproved a smash hit in his home country of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, writingthe screenplays for two excellent films couldn't sway enough voters toleave Beale Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bubbling under throughout the night was solid appreciation for the New York-centric Can You Ever Forgive Me? while The Rider proved it wasn't just a one-trick pony by garnering points here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes! The clever screenplay for Spider-Man:Into The Spiderverse got much deserved attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it's not done yet? BEST NONFICTION FILM 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Won't You Be My Neighbor? -- 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three Identical Strangers -- 24 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Solo -- 20 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minding The Gap -- 19 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RBG -- 13 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The Best Nonfiction Film is a recent add to the IRAs and not without controversy (of course), since creating a category like this almost ensures a nonfiction film won't win the much-desired top prizefor Best Film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike the Oscars, the IRAs wasn't about to ignore nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big winner in a tightly fought category is the heart-warming Won'tYou Be My Neighbor? , about the career and impact of children's television pioneer Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heart-warming is normally not a strongsuit of the IRAs (which more often relishes the bitter and angry, thankyou very much).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the balm of this film was too strong in the age ofTrump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will such appreciation carry over to the performance of Tom Hanks as the sweater-clad TV host when A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood is released November 21, 2019? Three Identical Strangers came seemingly out of nowhere to place a close second, with Free Solo farther back at third, even though everyone involved risked their lives to make it! Sheesh! Minding The Gap was a real puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's quietly political in its observation of Rockford, Illinois (the hometown of Andy!) and its economic collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was shot over many years byone of the participants and clearly came to life in the editing room,with a great deal to say about class, gender, passion and the depressingly common passing down of addiction and abuse andabusive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, it wasn't even a player, ranking fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto RBG , though the IRAnians certainly send their best wishes to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and expect she will serve on the Supreme Court (and catch up on the best new films that aren't about her) for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOOD BREAK Pizza is eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Career highlights and lowlights are dissected, looming marriages are announced (Mazel tov!), career advancements areplanned (tenure, here we come), various medical aches and pains areprobed and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then action resumes! BALLOT MEASURES Change comes slowly to the IRAs but it does happen...after endless, exhausting debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two ballot measures were on deck for consideration. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE VOTE TO RESCIND -- a tentative move to consider voting to rescind the Vote To Rescind option is considered and then dropped by Andy once he senses little support for the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Vote To Rescind is offered after every single category is voted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the totals are in, members may feel the actual winner doesn't reflect thebest choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or perhaps they prefer the runner-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the winner isannounced, members are asked to consider a Vote To Rescind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If amajority of the members actively voting support it, the winner is rescinded and the runner-up is made the official champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is followed by another vote to rescind until the victor is confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a somewhat controversial tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it rarely comes into play more thanonce a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the 44th Annual IRAs, not a single victor is rescinded. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHANGING ELIGIBILITY RULES -- Since the beginning, the IRAs have had one rule for eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To qualify for the IRAs, a movie must have a minimum one-week commercial run in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This began in 1976, along with the delightful task of keeping track of all the films that opened in the city at any and every venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Listwas an essential feature of the IRAs, especially in the pre-Internet erawhen keeping track of what movies actually played was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nowof course, one can go right to IMDB and get a rough sense of when and where any movie has opened in countries or film festivals all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More dauntingly, the number of movies opening commerciallyin NYC has exploded to some 1000+ titles a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Furthercomplicating things, most IRA members don't even live in New YorkCity anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while members of the IRAs love to go to the movies anywhere and anytime (to see the latest art house flick or a revival of a classic or really damn near anything), the truth is that for many yearsnow they have made full use of DVDs and BluRay and cable and ondemand and now streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and even shared Vimeo links, all in a desire to see as many of the best films as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the result of the original rule was that certainfilms invariably fell through the cracks or were rejected as ineligiblefor unimportant commercial reasons nothing to do with artistry: play Sundance and get picked up by Amazon and you would usually get a nominal theatrical release; play Sundance and get picked up by Netflixand you might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why should we care who picks up a movie and howthey release it? A good film is a good film! The issue was debated passionately online and ultimately festival play was strongly rejected as qualifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following ballot measure was adopted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ON ELIGIBILITY: If a movie becomes available to us in any way on any platform (theatrical distribution, DVD, on demand, cable, streaming, etc.) in the previous calendar year, a member may vote for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Festival play alone does not qualify a film for eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a 7-5 vote, the ballot measure passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the 45th Annual IRAs, this new standard will determine eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regina King for If Beale Street Could Talk -- 24 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Awkwafina for Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean's 8 -- 22 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kayli Carter for Private Life -- 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amy Adams for Vice --12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nina Arianda for Stan (ampersand) Ollie -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: And Beale Street demonstrates again it's one of the most popular films of the year among IRA voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regina King's widely lauded performance in the film gets recognized here, despite a spiritedcampaign for Awkwafina, the best thing in two disparate comedies.The admiration of Tamara Jenkins and Private Life was solid if modest, making its biggest mark here with a nod for Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while Vice was much discussed in the free-for-all known as the IRA email threads, it came to little except this recognition of Adams as Lynne Cheney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because the bio-pic Stan and Ollie fell through the cracks in terms of availability, few saw it despite some admiring comments and the allure of a bio about classic Hollywood stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film didn't come out on DVD until the week of the IRAs and wasn't available on anymajor streaming service either (except as a rental).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even with the newrule change about availability, some movies will get lost in the shuffle.Technically, its wide availability on DVD and streaming will make Stan and Ollie eligible again in 2020, but with a solid, extended commercial release in theaters at the end of 2018 and into 2019 (in February, it was playing on 754 screens in North America), it's almost certain thefilm's chances have come and gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the way, Blogger can't handlethe ampersand symbol and turns it into gobbledygook when one typesit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence my insertion of (ampersand) in titles and writing credits when necessary.) BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brian Tyree Henry for Hotel Artemis , If Beale Street Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, White Boy Rick, Widows -- 24 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jonah Hill for Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot -- 19 pts. 3. (tie) Richard E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grant for Can You Ever Forgive Me? -- 13 pts. (tie) Jake Gyllenhaal for The Sisters Brothers, Wildlife --13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Yeun for Burning, Sorry To Bother You -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The Beale Street juggernaut keeps on a rollin'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brian Tyree Henry wins for his body of work in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In films good ( If Beale Street Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse ), ok films ( Widows ) and bad films ( Hotel Artemis and White Boy Rick ), Henry was the proverbial best thing in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of the animated Spider-Man were thrilled in particular for his recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Henry probably would have won this for Beale Street alone, thanks to his powerful performance of the monologue that serves as the film's beating heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multiple movies that appeared on many best-of lists by IRA votersenjoyed a moment in the spotlight here: The Sisters Brothers, Wildlife, Sorry To Bother You, Burning, Can You Ever Forgive Me? and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs provide a great checklist of movies to watch from the year inquestion, especially when you dive deeper than just the winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakura AndÃ´ for Shoplifters -- 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elsie Fisher for Eighth Grade-- 22 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomasin McKenzie for Leave No Trace -- 20 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Melissa McCarthy for Can You Ever Forgive Me? --16 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julianne Nicholson for Who We Are Now -- 13 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Sakura AndÃ´ wins the first award for director Horokazu Kore- eda's Shoplifters , one of two very good films he released in North America this year. (She played the would-be mother figure for thegang of thieves.) My hopes for the terrific debut of Elsie Fisher in BoBurnham's marvelous Eighth Grade were dashed, but just barely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it gave me some slim hope Burnham and the film might be one of thecontenders to take down the seemingly unstoppable If Beale StreetCould Talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though come to think of it, that film's female lead wasn't even mentioned in this round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Eighth Grade (which really should have won here if it was going to fight for Best Picture), the movie Leave No Trace finally got some love with points for its young star Thomasin McKenzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto the more established Julianne Nicholson and her very independent film Who We Are Now.BEST ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joaquin Phoenix for Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot; Mary Magdalene; The Sisters Brothers; You Were Never Really Here -- 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zain Al Rafeea for Capernaum -- 22 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Redford for The Old Man And The Gun -- 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brady Jandreau for The Rider --15 pts. 5. (tie) Ah-in Yoo for Burning -- 12 pts. (tie) Christian Bale for Vice -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Some award-givers love to recognize actors in a bunch of films -- it's an easy way to celebrate a lot of different movies and bring moreattention to your awards. (Hey, we liked that cool commercial film, even if to be honest we're really celebrating this actor's work on that obscure art film none of you saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still!) That's not the IRAs.Nevertheless, we've got two major acting awards going to two actorswho displayed range and versatility in a clutch of films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henry wonBest Supporting Actor, though it should be pointed out he appeared intwo films ( If Beale Street and Spider-Man) that enjoyed strong support overall from voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not about quantity over quality.The same is true for Joaquin Phoenix, who starred in The SisterBrothers (mentioned a lot if not a big player), You Were Never Really Here and Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For good measure, he also played Jesus in Mary Magdalene .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phoenix wins Best Actor for the second time (he won in 2013 for his work on Her ) and is honored 27 years after his older brother River won for heartbreakingly goodwork on both Dogfight and My Own Private Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George boldly declared Joaquin Phoenix the best actor working today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phoenix'simpressive year held off strong competition from child actor/refugee Zain Al Rafeea of Capernaum .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An intense, Dardenne-like drama that follows the journey of a desperate boy in bombed-out Lebanon, Capernaum depends entirely on the work of Al Rafeea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this film was going to triumph anywhere, it was probably here, but the sheernumber of strong performances by Phoenix in multiple good films triumphed on a technical knockout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the other end of a career compared to Zain is Robert Redford, giving a twinkly, this-is-what-a-movie-star-looks-like turn in the charming flick The Old Man And The Gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not enough IRA members saw it, sadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many saw and admired The Rider, giving rodeo rider Brady Jandreau serious attention for his autobiographical work in that drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christian Bale's showy work in Vice and Ah-In Yoo's internalized despair in Burning both brought up the rear for their deserving turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIDE NOTE: Handling the accounting means I sometimes blow a chance to make a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In my excitement over echoing a vote for Zain, I forgot to say, "For giving the most enigmatic performance of the year, where I thought he was the hero but then maybe he was thevillain...Jussie Smollet!" Oh well.BEST DIRECTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nadine Labaki for Capernaum -- 23 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ChloÃ© Zhao for The Rider -- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hirokazu Kore-eda for Shoplifters, The Third Murder -- 17 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spike Lee for BlacKKKlansman -- 14 pts. 5. (tie) Debra Granik for Leave No Trace -- 11 pts. (tie) Adam McKay for Vice -- 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Ok, so the love for Capernaum wasn't limited to the remarkable debut of Zain Al Rafeea! Director Nadine Labaki became the first woman to win Best Director since Nancy Savoca won the 1991 prize for Household Saints. (So far, they're the only two to do so for a particular year, though director Chantal Ackerman is #21 on our all-time best list with Jeanne Dielman. ) Labaki's victory wasn't by a massive margin but a five point advantage over the runner-up and theshocking fact that Barry Jenkins didn't even make the list of honoreesdespite already winning five IRAs on the night means this: we've gotourselves a horse race! And If Beale Street may not even make it out of the starting gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As mentioned, Labaki is only the second woman to win Best Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even better, she's one of three women on our list this year...including runner-up ChloÃ© Zhao for The Rider! (Debra Granik brought up the rear.) Toss in Japanese director Kore-eda and Spike Lee and we're looking at a list with only white dude on it --Adam McKay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he did it with a take-down of other white dudes, I might add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For one brief shining moment, the IRAs is woke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But"woke" is an on-going process not a state of being, so we'll have to dojust as well in every category for years to come to indicate realprogress in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, the films released in 2018 let usshow we can celebrate diversity with the best of 'em and for the best ofreasons: they are the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PICTURE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capernaum -- 22 pts. 2. (tie) The Rider -- 17 pts. (tie) Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse -- 17 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Beale Street Could Talk -- 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shoplifters -- 13 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the grand finale and for the first time in history, the best film of the year is directed by a woman. (The year Nancy Savoca won directorfor Household Saints, that movie was beaten out by Six Degrees Of Separation for Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bad call.) The IRAs are pretty stalwart auteurists, but it was a wild and wooly vote with some shockers at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse didn't score a single point for Best Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said more about the nature of this particular film, since animated movies are a group effort like nothing since musicals inthe heyday of MGM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spidey almost made history as the first animated film to win Best Picture, a long-overdue barrier that needs to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was tied for second, alongside the acclaimed indie effort The Rider .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That one didn't seem a contender for a while, but the points it didscore were in key categories like Cinematography, Screenplay and Actor while the areas it didn't get points in (Production Design, Use Of Music) had more to do with the type of film it was tha with the qualityof work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add in Zhao's strong showing in Best Director and the fivepoint gap separating it from the winner suddenly seems quite small indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beale Street fell way back to fourth place, but hey, it's an honor just to be nominated, right? Jenkins can take comfort in five IRAs and the dominating sweep Moonlight enjoyed just two years ago when it won four awards including Picture and Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kore-edamight have suffered from having two movies in contention, but even if he had just competed with one or the other, it's doubtful his support would have doubled so he could snag a victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, Capernaumwon and so did the IRAs, with a woman standing on top clutching theIRA for Best Film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time but not, we venture to say, for thelast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On The Basis of Sex -- 14 pts. 2. (tie) Let The Sunshine In -- 10 pts. (tie) Mary Poppins Returns -- 10 pts. 4. (tie) Cold War -- 8 pts. (tie A Wrinkle In Time -- 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Favourite -- 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bohemian Rhapsody -- 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Green Book -- 17 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roma -- 9 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BlacKKKlansman -- 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The Favourite was my favorite film of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only didn't it win anything, it was the most mocked movie of the year to boot!(Welcome to my world, says Andy.) Apparently, the fish eye lens is unforgivable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone tell Stanley Kubrick, who won the first Best Picture award for Barry Lyndon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fishy, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fun fact: all five films here were nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MECHANICAL ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tilda Swinton for Suspiria -- 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Lawrence for Red Sparrow -- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meryl Streep for Mary Poppins Returns -- 17 pts.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dakota Johnson for Suspiria -- 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glenn Close for The Wife -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Actors often win a top award only to be tagged with a Mechanical award once IRA voters decide those artists are using the same tics and mannerisms for role after role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're an unforgiving lot, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That delightful creature Swinton (cooler than all the IRAnians put together times a thousand) won Best Actress for the 2010 film I Am Love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deservingly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, the great Meryl Streep (who has indeed done a poor job in recent years picking roles) has been snapping up Mechanicals since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was singled out for 1986's Heartburn , 2007's Lions for Lambs and the film Rendition , 2008's Doubt , 2011's The Iron Lady and 2013's August: Osage County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Streep has never won a proper IRA but can take some comfort in 21 Oscar nominations and three wins, along with two BAFTAs and threeEmmys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's also an EGOT in nominations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MECHANICAL ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rami Malek and his dentures for Bohemian Rhapsody -- 18 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lin-Manuel Miranda for Mary Poppins Returns -- 13 pts. 3.

You Were Never Really Here WHO OR WHAT ARE THE IRAS? A HISTORY The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the best films of the year since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officially known as the New York Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs - - they are more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag- out fight to establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story lost in the mist of time, alcohol and since it was the 1970s perhaps cannabis.) The IRAs group has been profiled in The New Yorker, so it is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of it .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-selling and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics, screenwriters, budding playwrights, film scholars, plain old movie buffs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best movies of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are passionate film lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many have careers involving the arts, but it's not always easy to stay in the swim of things, to keep on top of the flood of new releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) eventually on some streaming service or DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life, before jobs and family made frivolous claims on their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you want to stay on top of great cinema every year or explore its history, there's no better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the year than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they've been doing it for decades so hey, it's tradition!
