                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , J U N E 2 2 , 2 0 0 5Bush Says Bring It On And Uh, The Bad GuysBring It Onby Michael in New York on 6/22/2005 10:55:00 AMWell, Bush got his wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hoped would-be terrorists wouldcome to Iraq and now the New York Times reports a new CIAstudy says that Iraq is becoming a breeding ground forterrorists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, instead of standing around andwaiting politley to be killed, these jihadists are going to takethe skills they've learned so effectively in Iraq and spread itaround the world.The assessment had argued that Iraq, since the Americaninvasion of 2003, had in many ways assumed the roleplayed by Afghanistan during the rise of Al Qaeda duringthe 1980's and 1990's, as a magnet and a proving groundfor Islamic extremists from Saudi Arabia and other Islamiccountries.The officials said the report spelled out how the urbannature of the war in Iraq was helping combatantslearn how to carry out assassinations,kidnappings, car bombings and other kinds ofattacks that were never a staple of the fighting inAfghanistan during the anti-Soviet campaigns of the1980's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was during that conflict, primarily rural andconventional, that the United States provided arms toOsama bin Laden and other militants, who laterformed Al Qaeda....The officials said Saudi Arabia, Jordan and othercountries would soon have to contend withmilitants who leave Iraq equipped withconsiderable experience and training.As for how many of the insurgents are foreigners, it seems to me likeevery day we get a new answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a week ago, top militarypeople in Iraq were admitting that early on they saw a big percentageof foreigners, but now the insurgency was dominated by Iraqis (ie.Sunnis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a few days later someone else argues the exactopposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another New York Times story says the insurgency is nowfacing a lot of infighting with locals tired of the fanatical foreigners."There is a rift," said the official, who requestedanonymity, citing the sensitivity of the talks he hadheld. "I'm certain that the nationalist Iraqi part of theinsurgency is very much fed up with the Jihadistsgrabbing the headlines and carrying out the sort ofviolence that they don't want against innocentcivilians."The nationalist insurgent groups, "are giving alot of signals implying that there should be asettlement with the Americans," while theJihadists have a purely ideological agenda, he added.Yeah, right, the locals are dying to lay down their arms but keep theinsurgency going so they can kill Saudis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mixed into the story is thisdetail: during certain raids, Marines report killing 40 insurgents, atleast three of them foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would mean the insurgency wasabout 92% Iraqi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben SmithGoing small - My story tonight: President BarackObama came alive about 50 minutes intoWednesday night’s news conference – whensomebo3 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsMichael Likosky: Ed Rendell: Hardest Working Manin Infrastructure - At this year's National GovernorsAssociation (NGA) meeting, Governor Ed Rendell'stenure as Chair fittingly came to a close with aplenary session on infras...21 minutes ago Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Today, srkp23(pulling a double shift), ybruti, taylormattd,ItsJessMe and vcmvo2 combed through hundredsof diaries to find this powerful list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today's...40 minutes ago EschatonOvernight - Folk On.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newish.57 minutes ago Crooks and LiarsOpen Thread - Open Thread below...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Next 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Bush ...http://www.americablog.com/2005/06/bush-says-bring-it-on-an... 1 of 57/23/09 1:00 AMVisit ourAMERICAblog TV site.see all 322 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod For the GOPers, healthcare is politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just Traditional media has todebunk the birthers One small step...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The right-wing media, thevoices of the GOP, in REM - Orange CrushAMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Bush ...http://www.americablog.com/2005/06/bush-says-bring-it-on-an... 2 of 57/23/09 1:00 AMThe TreatmentObama Has a Grown-UpTalk With America(Gulp)1 hour agoEzra KleinTab Dump5 hours agoWonk RoomSen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Byron Dorgan:The ‘Trade’ InCap-And-Trade ‘MakesNo Sense To Me’6 hours agoHealth BeatTruth Squad: WallStreet Journal HealthCare Editorial Wrong onthe Facts . . .7 hours agoDaily DoseProviders Endorse 'Payfor Value' ProposalsG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
