"Ah, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twain! How pleasant to see you!" Shomer's tale is an engaging one with a strong sense of time and place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two figures at its heart are interesting characters and yet not seemingly quite whom they claim to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, and most successfully, we go back even further in time to the 17th century and John Saturnall's Feast .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawrence Norfolk, the author of Lempriere's Dictionary , delivers a romance suffused with a love of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero John is the son of a woman accused of witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, she provides healing herbsand medicines for the people of their village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's a deeper truth to the charge because John'smother also keeps alive the pagan traditions of a feast shared by one and all, a tradition that predatesChristianity and upends the social order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bullied and picked on by the other children, John has a miserable existence that only becomes worse when religious fanaticism rears its head and they're driven into the woods, where she starves to death and he struggles simply to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his mother's parting gift is to teach John to read and thus memorizethe book she always carries: an elaborate description of the feast itself, dish by glorious dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before you know it, John has been deposited at the dreary Buckland Manor to apprentice in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His remarkable sense of smell (John can parse out spices and flavoring with ease) sends John flying through the ranks until he's second in command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's when he's ordered to tempt young Lady Lucretia into breaking her fast with succulent dishes and thus fulfill her father's wishes and marry the tiresomePiers Callock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would you be surprised to discover that John and Lady Lucretia fall in love? But their impossible romance becomes even more dangerous when rebellion spreads and the King is overthrown by Oliver Cromwell and his fanatic followers. (They don't even like Christmas!) War, betrayal, the need to save Buckland Manor and a pious disapproval of sensuous meals all combine to frustrate thisupstairs/downstairs romance and John's gift for elaborate dishes.HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Katy Perry Video House Of Representatives California Elections Gay Rights Death Penalty own- relationships Paranormal Food Stamps Buy a link here MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »Norfolk delivers a strong tale filled with atmosphere and the odd, telling detail that convinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a great chef can improvise and make a dish his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Norfolk sticks too closely to the recipe forromance, right down to a predictable and rather hard to swallow finale that doesn't satisfy, thanks to unlikely turns of fortune and revelations that don't surprise in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this doesn't detract from the essential originality of the tale, the pleasure with which it is told and the satisfaction of a feast that exists only in the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOOKS I'VE READ SO FAR IN 2012 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
