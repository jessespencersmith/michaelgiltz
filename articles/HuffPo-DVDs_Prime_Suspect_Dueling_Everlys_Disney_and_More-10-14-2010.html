Their joy in performingtogether again is palpable and set them touring and recording for much of the next decade to solid success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder they rate this night as a highlight of their long and illustrious career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bonus feature is a shortened version of a documentary running about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The concert itself is in decentshape visually and sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a brilliant film so much as a document of a very special moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans who don't own it will be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't know them, for heaven's sake, start listening. 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS camille grammer helen mirren poses nude miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant More Celebrity News at People.com PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss Comments (532) Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton Joins Future In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp; Vanessa Hudgens Back On? READ MORE Willliam and Kate's Love StoryROBIN HOOD ($39.98 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; Universal) -- Everyone wants to reboot franchises and get gritty and do unexpected origin stories and mix it up so they can make a stodgy old "property" seem cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when you're running in fright from every single identifiable element of aclassic tale (in this case: the tights, the Merry Men, the archery, a nobleman risking everything to helpout the weak, and most of all the fun), then something is wrong and you should ask yourself, why has this tale been popular for hundreds of years and why am I avoiding so much of that story? It's a shame, because Russell Crowe makes a good Hood, even if his embrace of Universal Human Rights comeshundreds of years early and seems a little silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the film really gets daft at the finale where MaidMarian (Cate Blanchett who, not surprisingly has been strong and proto-feminist throughout) plays an absurd part in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loaded with extras and it certainly looks and sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FANTOMAS: THE COMPLETE SAGA ($34.95; Kino) -- This collection of five serials starring the dastardly criminal Fantomas is catnip for silent film buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, Kino presents the films with care,including commentary and shorts from director Louis Feuillade ( Les Vampires ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dating from 1913-1914, it's one long epic tale in which the criminal is truly vicious, the police relentless and the adventures grow increasingly baroque and outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the price is perfect for a specialty item like this that can't have been cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just inexpensive enough to encourage casual movie buffs to check it out, while fans of serials and Fantomas won't have to break the bank to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great fun.TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift Kourtney K.'s StunningBikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER More Celebrity News at Popeater.com One And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,212 Comments PHOTOS: Ellen DeGeneres &amp; Portia de Rossi's Exotic Vacation 264 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,028 Comments PHOTOS: Raven- Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss 531 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 65 Comments PHOTO: Adam Levine Goes Nude 242 CommentsThere's No Viral Video Like'Home' Michelle Williams on Keeping Heath's MemoryAliveGLEE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ($69.99 BluRay; $59.98 regular; FOX) Facebook Gabrielle Giffords Video NFL Gun Control iPad Haiti Earthquake Atheism Sarah PalinHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST THE BIG BANG THEORY THIRD SEASON ($54.97 BluRay or $44.98 regular; Warner Bros.) IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA SEASON FIVE ($49.98 BluRay or $39.98 regular; FOX) CASTLE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON ($45.99; ABC) -- Okay, tv boxed sets come fast and furious so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glee is wildly uneven, but it's so fresh and original and the episodes that do hit their target are so enjoyable that it's a can't miss TV show, even when it misses. (Does that make any sense?) Plus,you can just watch the musical numbers when that's what you're in the mood for...or do karaoke, which I never do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I swear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I understand why Big Bang Theory is successful -- it's a joke machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's also relentlessly "jokey" with nary a moment for real characters to peep through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funnier than many sitcomsbut to me never more than fitfully amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunny In Philadelphia , on the other hand, is original and fresh in a Seinfeld/Arrested Development sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The addition of Danny DeVito has been a blessing and the cast has grown in confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As they warn you on the set, the show was shot in standard def (basic cable shows can't always afford fancy cameras) so no real point in splurging on the BluRay for thisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally I am thrilled that Nathan Fillion is in an honest to goodness hit with Castle .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, this is a standard issue mystery show but he's got charm to spare and great chemistry with his cop costar (Stana Katic) and it's undeniably fun, even if I don't feel gutted when I miss an episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how much more do we appreciate his poker night with mystery writer buddies like Stephen J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cannell now that Cannell is gone for good? And yes, I do keep thinking, wow, since this show is a hit do you think maybe they'll bring back Firefly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JANEANE GAROFALO: IF YOU WILL ($17.97 BluRay and $14.97 regular; Image) BILL MAHER: BUT I'M NOT WRONG ($19.98; HBO) -- The latest performances by two stand up comics who struck it big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garofalo is probably better known for her acting and radio gigs than her stand-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But after a long absence, she returns to the stage with a more self-deprecating, more generous if stillrazor sharp outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing groundbreaking here, but she's funny and puts enough of a spin onTwitter and semi-fame to make the hour spent with her worthwhile. (You gotta love someone who tells a story on themselves about walking into a Starbucks and having an employee say, "No offense, but you look like Janeane Garofalo.") Bill Maher, on the other hand, is less effective as a stand-up today becausehe's so clearly found the perfect medium for his witty insights on his TV political shows, including the current HBO series Real Time With Bill Maher , which is the only thing that keeps me sane when politics and especially the media coverage of politics can be so asinine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maher is really smart and pointed and focused on that show; he'll make a funny joke if he can, but not to defuse the subject or let hisinterviewee off the hook the way Jon Stewart might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maher's jokes always skewer pretension and lies too deftly for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stand-up just seems superfluous when his real gift is political commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, he'sstill fun to see and I hope some other topic engages him the way religion did and he makes another documentary because Religulous was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But plain old stand-up makes me feel like I'm not getting the full Maher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like going to a massage parlor and having them walk away before the happy ending.Maher would never stand for that, would he? TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE ($39.99 BluRay and $29.99 regular; Disney) THE BLACK CAULDRON ($19.99; Disney) -- I give Disney a lot of grief for their straight-to-DVD line of movies, which I think cheapen major properties like The Lion King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's often a proving ground for new talent that graduates to feature films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, when they're focusing on a minor character like Tink and building her up, it doesn't seem so awful to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the third Tinkerbell feature and the series is improving and showing a little more spunk and action, which is welcome in a girl-oriented series like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why should the boys have all the fun? And the guest voices (Kristen Chenoweth, Michael Sheen) aretop-notch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Black Cauldron has always been an intriguing example of the road not taken by Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a PG film made during the early days of their renaissance (right after The Fox and the Hound but before The Great Mouse Detective and of course The Little Mermaid ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's based on a series of fantasy books and relatively darker (hence the PG rating) though hardly envelope-pushing in any way except atad more scary to very small kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney wanted to break out of its formula but couldn't quite bring itself to do so; the mature fantasy is undercut by typical Disney comic relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, they weren't ready to do really stunning animation yet so the backdrops are nice but relatively flat and static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Close, but no cigar,which is a shame: animated features are too constrained by the family friendly formula when they shouldbe tackling sci-fi and so many other genres...and not always have to be appropriate for eight year olds.THE THIRD MAN ($39.98 BluRay; Lionsgate/Studio Canal) DELICATESSEN ($39.99 BluRay; Lionsgate/Studio Canal) -- Two great films offered in BluRay by Studio Canal, which has funded thousands of movies over the years and recently launched a line of DVDs branded with its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Third Man is a masterpiece, of course, with Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles superb in Carol Reed's dark tale of post-war Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The question is how does it compare to the now out-of-print Criterion BluRay it in effect replaces? Basically, not so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extras are solid, though not asthorough; still, I do appreciate hearing from Welles biographer Simon Callow and clearly Studio Canal knew they needed to do a solid job on that front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the most important issue is the film itself and clearly this remastering is softer and not nearly as sharp and crisp as the Criterion print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since The ThirdMan is one of the great films of all time (and taught me the meaning of mise en scene), its image is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a decent print, better than you'd see in many revival houses back when theyhad revival houses or showed old prints on late night TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have nothing to compare it to it's fine.But not world class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it's all you can get, you needn't fret; but it's a shame they didn't do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studio Canal is on firmer ground with the more recent film Delicatessen , a very black comedy from Jeanet &amp; Caro, responsible together or alone for later films like Amelie and A Very Long Engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a striking film with wildly inventive camerawork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no earlier print to compare it to, but it seemsrather...orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, I think that might be the choice of the directors, who also filmed many scenes with fog for their post-apocalyptic (?) tale of very hungry apartment dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, the Studio Canalbrand promises solid extras and decent prints that are acceptable if not the absolute premium best. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does not obligate him in any way to speak positively or negatively of their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments 0 Pending Comments 0View FAQ Director: 'Ghostbusters 3' Script Is Ready Gwyneth Paltrow To Return To 'Glee' As...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini (PHOTOS) Andy Samberg, Johnny Knoxville To Star In...Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Read more from Huffington Post bloggers: Steven Shehori: The Off-Topic Interview: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney We recently sat down with Rob McElhenney, creator of Sunny... to discuss thesecret to the series' longevity, the legendary Danny DeVito, and some eyebrow- raising storylines planned for future episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then things got a bit off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recency | PopularityComments are closed for this entry View All</p>
