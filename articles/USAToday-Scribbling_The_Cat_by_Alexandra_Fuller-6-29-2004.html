                <p>Qui bling with Ful er's 'Scribbling' Scribbling the Cat: Travels With an African Soldier By Alexandra Fuller The Penguin Press, 256 pp., $24.95 By Michael Giltz Special for USA TODAY Alexandra Fuller can't get out of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was born in England but spent most of her young life in war-torn Zimbabwe (then called Rhodesia) and later Malawi and Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The troubled continent has been the source of her literary inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller's best-selling memoir, Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, vividly depicted her childhood after her father went off to war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The women and children who were left behind learned to fire guns, apply first aid and save a bullet for themselves if worse came to worst. , Now, a return to Africa to visit her folks brings FullÂ­ er in contact with K, a banana farmer and battleÂ­ scarred veteran of those conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Curiosity scribbled the cat (slang for killed), but Fuller can't help herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; K is a compelling character and she soon persuades him to take her on a tour of the sites where he fought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; K is a frightening, fascinating man - a born-again Christian prone to violent outbursts, cryÂ­ ing jags and troubled dreams (because of, presumably, the atrocities he committed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AlÂ­ most immediately, K decides that Fuller is the wife God inÂ­ tends for him, and Fuller plays By Margaret Bonner along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; K's war buddies are just Fuller: Has gone from Dogs to Cat. as memorable, especially MaÂ­ penga, who lives on an island with a "pet" lion that seems determined to make a meal out of the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dogs, written from a young girl's perspective, didn't bother pointing out the obvious: that Fuller's parents held racist views and were wrong to support RhodeÂ­ sia's minority-ruled government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She tries to mainÂ­ tain a certain impartiality in Scribbling, but now that she's an adult, this fence-sitting is tougher to pull o[ In addition, the country's black population comes off as just colorful background for much of this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The history and politics of the country's wars are rareÂ­ ly broached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the curiosity that scribbled the cat doesn't seem quite curious enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That Mapenga's righthand man on his island was once a soldier fighting against bim is surely worth more than a passing mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Fuller is sheepish about admitting she's a vegetarian, you give. up hope she'll dlallenge these men's deepest beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, her descriptions of these soldiers of misÂ­ fortune are provocative and vivid, And one thing is clear: K and others like binl are marginalized and out of power; a-uel, capricious governments treat them with a wary disdain; and the world at large pays them no mind.</p>
