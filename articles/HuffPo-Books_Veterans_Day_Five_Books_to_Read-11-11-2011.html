Finally, it's Willie &amp; Joe: Back Home that moved me the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cover shows a soldier without a place to stay, sleeping on a park bench and covered in a poster saying "Welcome Home" to the soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too often, soldiers are praised and appreciated in the heat of battle but treated like an annoyance once thefighting has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Mauldin wasn't even sure anyone would want to hear about Willie &amp; Joe onceWorld War II had been won and, indeed, the strip faded in popularity, especially as Mauldin tackled social issues and kept a spotlight on the poor treatment of soldiers, who deserved better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly, veterans don't get two votes at the ballot box despite their service and the risking of life and limb when called to duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sometimes even that one vote, that one voice is begrudged, whether it's theveteran in Oakland sent to the hospital by cops during an apparently peaceful protest in the Occupymovement or a soldier getting booed during a Presidential debate because he identified himself as gay and said he wanted to serve his country without having to lie. it's all happened before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todd DePastino's excellent essay details Mauldin's career, his artistic achievements and the battles he fought within himself and with his syndicators over this series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mauldin is always funny, but those with a rosy image of WW II will be surprised by the complex world shownhere: sometimes veterans are chagrined to discover that jobs they were assured would be waiting for them have disappeared while other times they're disconcerted to see the person who is going to be fired to make way for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, veterans are forgotten, forced to travel home by riding the railsor wondering where the crowds are that greeted vets after the victory in Europe but have moved on bythe time the Pacific boys head home.HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Holidays Diary Weird News Business Racism Roman Polanski Buy a link here Sponsored Links 57 Year Old Mom Looks 27 Local Mom Reveals $5 Wrinkle Trick that is Angering Botox Doctors! www.Daily-Lifestyles.com Black Friday Leaked Ads SignUp &amp; Get Black Friday Leaked Ads &amp; Doorbuster Deals emai...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BlackFriday2011.com Official Obama Website Stand with Barack Obama now to say: "wecanâ€™t wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Join the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BarackObama.com How to Talk to Little Girls Like 291K The Pioneering Genius Of Anne McCaffrey Like 269 theellenshow RetweetI'm so thankful for @MarloThomas and Jennifer Aniston and theincredible work they do for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can help them. http://t.co/8e6dE micaelsilva RetweetFox News Viewers Know Less ThanPeople Who Don't Watch Any News: Study http://t.co/QL8AVm9xThis was bad enough as far as some newspapers were concerned, but Mauldin really lost them when he continually focused on social issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mauldin skewered the prejudice that treated a returning vet as a Japbecause of how he looked, never mind where he was born or where he fought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He mocked the VFW, at the time held hostage according to Mauldin by the soldiers of a different era who blocked moves to give WW II vets real say in the organization and then publicly supported hateful agendas like segregation that had nothing to do with the group as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mauldin could tease young college students fired up by social consciousness but turn around and be blistering over the vicious prejudice and hatred of lynching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People turned away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where were the easy laughs of Willie &amp; Joe? Papers dropped him, even as Mauldin found the right voice to balance his heart with his humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By December 31, 1946 it was all over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Willie &amp; Joe were home but forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mauldin had just won the Pulitzer Prize one year earlier but no one wanted to hear him now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the 1950s he would focus on editorial cartooning with great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Willie &amp; Joe were still beloved by the greatest generation, given tribute by Charles Schulz in his Peanuts strip on Veterans Day in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Willie &amp; Joe and Mauldin made it onto a stamp in 2010, seven years after he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now Fantagraphics has captured Mauldin's most enduring characters in two releases that do him justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Veterans Day proves the spur to dive into any of these books (or the many others I might have mentioned), then that's just one more reason to say thanks to the people who have served in the past and do so today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
