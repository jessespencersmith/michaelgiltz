Debut author Brendan Mathews delivers an old- fashioned page-turner, using the 1939 World's Fair in New York City to bring together a vivid cast of characters and set them to spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Ireland, an escaped convict and his wayward priest of a brother accidentally blow up an IRA safe houseand flee to America with a bag of cash and a cockamamie cover story about being Scottish royalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, they bookrooms at the Plaza where the con falls hard for an heiress and the priest struggles to regain his memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their brother in the US has just quit his gig in a successful but boring big band for a once in a lifetime dream of starting his own group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, a Jewish refugee from Prague desperately tries to extend her visa and bring her love safely out from under thefoot of the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh and the Irish mob wants our con artist to assassinate the King of England at the World's Fair or they'llslaughter his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That enough story for you? Mathews creates a lot of vivid characters and while everything ends upalmost exactly the way you expect/want, it's vivid enough to keep you uncertain right up to the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only misstep is a comically detailed postscript in which Mathews explains what happens to everyone in the decades to come in such precise and predictable fashion that you roll your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why bother? His imagination is rich; he needs to trust that ours is too. --Michael Giltz What Others Say Advance praise for The World of Tomorrow : "Entertaining . . . outsized . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The World of Tomorrow views its teeming cast of characters as though from the observation deck of one of the city skyscrapers that seem to 'burst from the pages of a comic book.' . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reveling in bold twists and fantastic coincidences, Mathews's big, expressive debut inhabits a world that's neither of the past nor the future but wholly of the imagination."â Sam Sacks , Wall Street Journal - "This Doctorow-esque debut novel shimmers with the swing and swank of 1939 New York . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews's urbanepic is as rich and raucous as the city it celebrates."â O., The Oprah Magazine - "Mathews has a big, rambunctious talent . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is a wonderful scene-setter, whether he's describing the streets of Manhattan in the wee hours or conjuring the glories of then brand-new Rockefeller Center . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gusto of his prose and vividness of his characters keeps the novel gyrating with zany energy . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anexuberant debut novel ."âMichael Upchurch , Chicago Tribune - "The World of Tomorrow is that rarest of historical novels, a book that catches a moment in a jar, holds it aloft, and displays it for what it really is: Somebody else's day before tomorrow, the instant right before the futurecomes . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews's entire novel takes place over the course of one week in June of that year, culminating at the World's Fair itself, in a fast-paced finale worthy of a Scorcese long-take .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I love this about the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love the bright-eyed joy of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The meticulous attention to detail that actually serves the plot . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I likethat Mathews made this big book so intimate . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the strengths of his story is the way it sprawls and loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It finds odd little corners of time and place and character to get into and, in those corners, it finds both abalancing seriousness and a wideness of vision."â Jason Sheehan , NPR - "A promising writer . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews is an able prose stylist, and breathing life into so many diverse characters is no mean feat . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The possibility of dramatic transformation amid historical ferment is at the heart of The World of Tomorrow , a fat novel stuffed with well-drawn characters grappling with different versions of themselves . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews has a flair for bringing street scenes to life, and his hopscotching narrative-from a Harlem jazz joint to a Bowery art studio to a Fifth Avenue palace-makes for an enjoyable tour of a vanished city . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An affabledebut novel."â John Freeman Gill , Washington Post - "A madcap rollick tinged with a touch of menace, The World of Tomorrow delights in sending its characters pinging around pre-World War II New York, on the run from Irish gangsters, fascist regimes, and crazy relatives .. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews's breezy epic captures a hustling spirit soon to be subsumed by a world at war . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A dazzling literary debut ."âChris Vognar , Dallas Morning News - "The World of Tomorrow is a big American novel , filled with ordinary people on the verge of extraordinary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By week's end, each will have made a pivotal choice whose consequences ripple far beyond their ownlives . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with many novels that feel quintessentially American, immigrants and refugees are lead characters .. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is Mathews's first novel, but you would not know it from the depth of its characters or the tight-as- a-snare-drum pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He connects multiple narratives in gratifying and often surprising ways, which makesthis nearly 600-page story fly by faster than many books half its size . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews infuses The World of Tomorrow with the sights, sounds, and smells of 1930s New York: the energy of the dancers in Harlem's Savoy Ballroom when the band is running hot; the island-unto-itself nature of a Park Avenue mansion; the savorydelicacies from a pushcart on a crowded Bowery street . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews takes exquisite care in creating evenmarginal characters and locales . . . [He gives] a sense of an entire neighborhood in a few phrases . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's rare to read a book whose range and ambition so aptly fit its title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page after page, The World of Tomorrow lives up to its notable name." âCarol Iaciofano , WBUR - "Mathews writes extraordinarily well . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His plot, rife with geopolitical intrigue, is nicely calibrated . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His characters are likable and clever . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're Depression-weary, ready to transcend 'the sordid history of the Old World and looking boldly to the future.' This is an expansive theme, and from it, the first-time author has carved a commendable novel."â Kevin Canfield , Minneapolis Star Tribune - "Mathews deftly handles a large cast of characters in The World of Tomorrow . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the most vibrant character of all, however, is New York itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In hard-boiled prose that ranges from gossipy to poetic, Mathews takes us from humble Bronx homes to rowdy Manhattan jazz clubs, from grimy back alleys to palatial Fifth Avenue estates . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The World of Tomorrow is a sweeping, impressive accomplishment . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews has written an insightful immigrant epic, not to mention a first-class literary thriller."â Tom Deignan, BookPage - "What a beguiling debut Brendan Mathews has given us in The World of Tomorrow : clever, smart, ambitious, richly textured, and moving." âRichard Russo , Pulitzer Prize-winning and New York Times bestselling author of Everybody's Fool - "Brash, bold, completely entertaining, and dazzling in its evocation of time and place, Brendan Mathews's splendid debut offers pleasures on every page." âAndrea Barrett , National Book Award-winning author of The Air We Breathe and Ship Fever - "What a book! The World of Tomorrow is a panoramic tour-de-force, a huge undertaking peopled with convincing characters and animated by a persuasive historical accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But beyond all that, my fascination was with the way Mathews assembled the novel, sifting and endlessly resifting his characters like sand, as life itself piled up right in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grim realities of America on the cusp of a second World War will be recognizable, but in this capable writer's hands, the individual characters-passionate, secretive, naÃ¯ve, lucky, unlucky, and sometimes hapless-remain full of surprises to the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They exist not against the backdrop of history, buttangled up in its complex, cruel, or absurd demands, desperate to find whatever space is allowed them for intimacy."â Ann Beattie , PEN/Malamud-winning author of The New Yorker Stories - "In this sweeping book of slippery secret identities, Brendan Mathews invites us to sink deeply into the hearts and minds of a score of colorful characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Magically constructed and methodically researched, The World of Tomorrow is a vastly entertaining novel about the powerful pull of family, the weight of history, and the allure of escaping into a better life-all set against a vivid and unforgettable New York."â Eleanor Henderson , New York Times bestselling author of Ten Thousand Saints - "Masterful....This novel is a remarkably fast and exhilarating read, reminiscent of Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay ....With the wit of a '30s screwball comedy and the depth of a thoroughly researched historical novel, this one grabs the reader from the beginning to its suspenseful climax."âPublishers Weekly (Starred Review) - "Mathews's first novel is all you could want in a piece of popular fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tension never lets up, and the story is fast and mind-spinningly complicated....There's suspense, humor, love, of both the doomed and requitedvarieties....This novel should prove irresistible to anyone wanting a diverting read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's quality stuff--and fun." âDavid Keymer , Library Journal (Starred Review) - "As everything rolls toward an adrenaline-fueled finale, Mathews brilliantly creates characters who embody the esprit de corps of immigrants and movingly explores themes of class, society, race, and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For fans ofMichael Chabon and E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctorow."â Bill Kelly, Booklist, starred review - "Mathews' colorful debut novel examines the legacy of Irish political violence for a family in both the old country and New York during one busy week in 1939....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the many splashes of New York atmosphere, the strongest are snapshots of the city's prewar musical frenzy....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mathews' debut shows impressive control of this narrativecornucopia."â Kirkus Reviews, starred review - What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
