Because it's a very good, sometimes great show;because watching them in order can be subtly more satisfying; and because putting it on your shelfsays, "I really liked this show!" Someone with the complete original Star Trek or the complete Benny Hill? Entirely different message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also just out is Season One of Flight of the Conchords ($29.98; HBO), which is perfect for people who don't own HBO or just want to skip to the musical numbers; and Melrose Place: Third Season ($54.99; Paramount), because if you don't watch every episode of a soap in order, how will you remember who is sleeping with whom? And thanks to DVDs, countless hours of TV memories that might have been lost forever are rescued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bob Hope's decades of TV specials are celebrated in Bob Hope: The Ultimate Collection ($29.99; R2), a two disc set with nearly eight hours of highlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even better is Here's Johnny: The Definitive DVD Collection ($99.99; R2), a 12 disc set that packs together four previous collections in one massive box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains about 20 hours of well-chosen clips, which sounds like a lot until you realize he delivered 4,500 hours of TV over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But maybe the defining TV on DVD experience is to watch a classic serialized drama or miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it doesn't get more classic than Fassbinder's epic 13 part German miniseries BerlinAlexanderplatz ($124.95; Criterion), a work hailed as a masterpiece when it was shown in US Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(And no, Alex Rodriguez isn't included.) Wrestling fans have been showeredwith titles, including John Cena: My Life ($34.95; WWE), a three disc set covering his entire career, seven complete matches and a tour of his car collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the dowdy world of tennis isslowly getting into the act: Wimbledon: The 2007 Official Film ($24.99; Kultur White Star) misses the mark with a rookie mistake: a 60 minute film for an event that covers two weeks and includeshundreds of hours of tennis? Wimbledon: The 2007 Men's Final ($24.99; Kultur White Star) is much better: it contains the entire three hour and 45 minute match, the warm-ups, the pre-game interviews, the trophy ceremony and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That 2007 Official Film would have made a nice extra, folks, not an entire film on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the DVD voom for sports has produced the lavish America's Game: Super Bowl I-XL ($199.98; Warner Bros.), which collects 40 new one hour documentaries on the first 40 Super Bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The effort put into this boxed set, which makes use of the terrific archives from the NFL is superlative - and will be even more spectacular if and when it comes out in HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just one more example that with DVDs, sports fans have entered the Promised Land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: Steven Spielberg's still-breathtaking classic Close Encounters Of The Third Kind Ultimate Edition ($39.95; Sony), which settles all arguments by properly providing every version of the film out there, from the theatrical version to the final, final one Spielberg just signedoff on; The Charles Burnett Collection ($39.95; Milestone), a faultless 2 disc set containing his legendary debut Killer Of Sheep, two versions of My Brother's Wedding, four shorts by Burnett and more in an exemplary package; La Vie En Rose ($27.95; HBO), the story of Edith Piaf featuring a performance by Marion Cotillard as the Little Sparrow that is sure to be catnip to theOscars; the animated blockbuster Shrek The Third ($29.99; DreamWorks), which will struggle to get an Oscar nomination thanks to a terrific year for animated films; a real-life Gumball Rally in3000 Miles ($19.99; Revolver) including Tony Hawk, who should know better, and Bam Margera, who doesn't; Ocean's Thirteen ($28.98; Warner Bros.), which is indeed better than Ocean's Twelve if not quite as finger-snapping cool as Ocean's Eleven but since that was far better than the original Ocean's Eleven, they're still ahead of the game; director Oliver Smolders could give David Lynch lessons in being odd, as proven with his feature debut Black Night ($29.95; Cult Epics) and his collection of shorts Spiritual Exercises ($29.95; Cult Films); the delightful fantasy The PrincessBride: 20th Anniversary ($19.98; MGM), which should be shared with your children after you've all read the classic novel together; the airless, brutal drama Flanders ($26.98; Koch) and a peek back at life in Duckburg, USA via DuckTales, Volume 3 ($34.99; Disney).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...
