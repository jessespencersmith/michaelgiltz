Who Needs Bush Officials WhenCNN Will Attack Critics For Him?by Michael in New York on 9/08/2005 06:00:00 PMPresident Bush gave a typically unimpressive little speech thisafternoon where he dutifully listed some obvious steps beingtaken for the Americans who had their lives destroyed byKatrina while he stayed on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush managed to lookserious and then refused to take questions. (Not that I heardreporters shout any at him, such as "When are you going toapologize to America for you and your top officials all stayingon vacation during this terrible disaster?")That was followed by Nancy Pelosi speaking to CNN's KyraPhillips, who berated Pelosi so severely for speaking out thatyou would have thought Pelosi was debating a Bushspokesperson instead of speaking to an independent reporter.Pelosi, of course, was terrific.First talking point: Phillips implied that since things are goingbetter now that it's wrong to keep criticizing Bush for hisadministration's incompetent response during that first crucialfive days.Phillips: "Are you changing your mind, at all, about how youfeel the Bush administration is handling this crisis up to thisvery minute?"Pelosi: "It's not a question of how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's what Iknow....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the FEMA head had reacted appropriately a weekago, there would have been less cost in lives and livelihood andpeople's homes in the region and a lot less cost in money tothe taxpayer....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I call once again on the President to replace thehead of FEMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FEMA was a failure last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many, manyhardworking FEMA workers were out there in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But theydidn't get the leadership and the accountability they needed....As we go forward, we can do better if we have professional,capable leadership in position at FEMA to do the job."They're interrupted by breaking news that 14 bodies have beenrecovered at a New Orleans hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phillips seemsoverwhelmed emotionally and can't look up at the camera for agood thirty seconds but keeps talking.Phillips went on to repeat the White House claim that Pelosi liedabout what the President said to her, even though Pelosirepeated it immediately to the media after speaking with thePresident, has remained consistent on it ever since and theWhite House at first would only smear her off the record andno one actually at the meeting has stepped forward on therecord to say she's lying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pelosi, of course, is telling the truth.Then Phillips rambles on about being "historical" and who didn'tfund the massive levee project and says this:Phillips: "I think it's unfair that FEMA is singled out.There are so many people responsible for what has happenedin the state of Louisiana."Pelosi: "That is true and I'm sorry you think that it'sunfair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it's unfair to the people wholost their family members, their lives, their livelihood, Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's crew ofRescue Rangers were vcmvo2, grog, dopper0189,shayera, and joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, dadanationlooked editorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh yeah, a big shout ...8 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsPalin's Next Step Is Still A Mystery - Sarah Palinwill enter uncharted political waters when sheleaves the Alaska stage Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the questionis whether she will go on to become...8 minutes ago FiredoglakeLate Night: MSNBC – Will Any RepublicanDenounce Rush Limbaugh?
