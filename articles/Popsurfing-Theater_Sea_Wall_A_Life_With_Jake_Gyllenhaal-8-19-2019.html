Two very talented actors tackle solo monologues in an evening of theater that offers love, death, laugh, perhaps a tear or two and some serious star power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Transferring from The Public, thiswork of theater keeps its intimacy mostly intact and amps up thehumor just a tad to fill the wider space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Honestly, you'd always choose to see great actors perform in as small a space as possible unless a show needed to be big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that doesn't change the fact that Tom Sturridge and Jake Gyllenhaal certainly make the Hudson Theatre(one of Broadway's tinier spaces) feel intimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon Stephens ( The Curious Incident of the Dog In The Night-Time ) wrote the probing, philosophical work Sea Wall for his friend Andrew Scott in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott, already popular from Sherlock , turned it into a barn-burning showcase that became a sensation in London on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott has gone on to a well-deserved meteoric rise as the "hot priest"in the TV series Fleabag .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that monologue is paired with Nick Payne's A Life to create a full evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Payne ( Constellations ) has been championed by Gyllenhaal who appears here in that work alongside Sturridge, who has theunenviable task of following Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both works are haunted by deathbut they are very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this production directed by Carrie Cracknell, Sea Wall is more ambitious but less successful while A Life aims lower but hits its mark more readily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The chance to see two fine actors up close makes it all worthwhile.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–¼ 2019 (50) â–º September (3) â–¼ August (7)Sturridge is a very talented actor (nominated for Tonys and Baftas) who has been wasted on the forgettable TV show Sweetbitter and a string of movies that haven't quite brought him to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet.Here he tackles the tale of Alex, a new father describing a holiday with his wife, daughter and prickly father-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex keeps veering into musings about life and fate...and when someone is angry about theidea that everything has a purpose or happens for a reason, you justknow some tragedy is going to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sturridge is very appealing but the transitions back and forth from the specific and concrete to more rarified ideas prove awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whetherit's the writing or Sturridge not hitting his stride yet, the seams areshowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't keep the awful darkness at its heart from havinga painful impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sturridge does manage the tricky task of revealing awful grief without wallowing in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These pieces are not misery porn, as some suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're too open-hearted and wise for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gyllenhaal's piece immediately lightens the tone, with its more amiable story of Abe, a soon-to-be father overwhelmed as he and his wife prepare for the birth of their first child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Life also flashes back to the death of Abe's own dad years ago and their loving relationship.The laughs come easier here, with Gyllenhaal such a magnetic charmerwe're always on his side, even when Abe makes a potentially tragic mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's such a smart performer, with Gyllenhaal's choices in theater and film proving impeccable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His commitment to the work, toexploring a monologue and helping make this evening of theaterhappen shows a dedication to the theater that's inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several minor details don't help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the few props on the bare stage is a piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gyllenhaal sits at it for a while before the show beginsand then noodles on it at the very end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One anecdote from hismonologue involves the song "Imagine" by John Lennon and YokoOno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the finale, he hints at that melody and then moves off, crooning a wordless tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't quite work, so perhaps actually playing (but not singing) "Imagine" would be better? That's followed by a visual flourish that brings both actors on stage at the same timebut physically isolated from one another, staring off into oppositedirections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Behind them a video projection of an apartment building isBROADWAY DIRECT: Fall Book Roundup For Theater Lov...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOWBIZ SANDBOX #459: Jay-Z and NFL Play Fans For...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Sturridge Grapple...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOWBIZ SANDBOX #458: Music Industry BattlesPlagu...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "Unchilding" Gets Shakily On Its Feet THEATER: more!

Neither moment (the music or the projection) matteredmuch, but they tilted the evening just a bit towards 2 1/2 stars instead of the more generous 3 stars it was headed for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
