No they are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is the usual high school travails, with four couples coupling and uncoupling in one way or another during the course of a party and the aftermath the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hannah (Abbe Tunison) and James(Davi Santos, looking like Jesse Metcalfe's younger brother) are the power couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's running for classpresident; he's running for vice president and everything is perfect until he dumps her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hannah turns tobaking for solace while James turns to old flame Sarah (Katie Mack), who knows she should resist hiscome-on but can't help herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That frees up Hannah's step brother Ben (Wesley Tunison) to finallyreveal his love for the high strung Hannah, which isn't that gross because a la Clueless they're not relatedby blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, jock Chris (a strapping Matthew J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riordan) doesn't mind so much having a cutegay stalker in Joe (the cute Daniel Quadrino), but what will his dudes think? The only couple that istogether and belongs that way is the truly troubled Nick (Justin Stein) and Jen (Sara Kapner) who met ina mental institution and generally race each other to the next emotional breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they ever decidewhich one of them is needier and more fragile, it'll be progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a way, almost every element of the show has promise, from the appealing cast to the songs (some of which really shine), the book (which can be quite fresh and clever) and especially the choreography by jennifer Weber, which owes a nod to Spring Awakening but has some wonderful touches all its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The freshest storyline by far belongs to Hannah, the perfect girl who can't quite hold it together and feels she should be the first female President of the US but really longs to be Betty Crocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her story feels likea cross between Clueless and Election and should really be the focus of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with many of the musicals reviewed here, Trouble is at its best when it isn't trying to be "serious" and important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hannah'sbig comic numbers -- "Shake and Bake" and "Should We Just Be Friends" are hilarious high points,delivered with aplomb by Tanenbaum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equally bright is the delightfully tuneful "Sitting In The Rain,"which Tunison delivers charmingly on a ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They all have in common a sense of fun and lack ofpretentiousness -- not to mention strong melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In show after shows, the songs that are comic or light GOP Approves Abortion Ban Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3Recommend 9k Like 7k Recommend 688 Tom Hanks Solidifies Nice Guy Reputation Through Photos, Videos Why Bobby Brown Walked Out of Rehab Holly Madison Is Pregnant Slash Caught Fellow Rocker Naked With His Mom 13 Movies That Changed The Way We View Poverty Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin invariably also aren't afraid of strong melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a lesson in here folks, one that Sondheim (the composer so many think they're following in the footsteps of when they shy from catchy tunes) learned long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gay romance of Chris and Joe isn't exactly startling and comes a little jarring at the very beginning of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Quadrino makes the most of his comic tune "I Stalk You A Little Bit" and the sparks fly pretty convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the smart joe shouldn't be quite so clueless about a jock needing time before coming out to everyone else and it would be nice if this story would surprise us a little more by notfollowing such a tried and true path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The caddish behavior of James is a little murkier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show presentsgood reasons for him to dump the superficial Hannah and when he worries about commitment with thetoo eager Sarah, we're right there with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then it confuses the issue by making him a serialromantic with insincere needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crossed signals in his journey should be straightened out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weakest story by far is unfortunately the most melodramatic and the one that takes center stage in the second act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the emotionally rocky terrain of two mentally troubled teens who have a tendency towards suicide attempts, panic attacks and doomed ideas like running away together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kapner and Stein actually have very nice chemistry, which comes across well in their first solo scene in an attic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But way too much high drama of the after school special variety is piled onto their laps and suddenly Jen is dressed like a hippie and the seemingly more stable Nick is hyperventilating and we just don't care what happens to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two actors are far too appealing to lose so don't cut this storyline completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But by all means let the simple fact that Nick is moving away be all the drama they need to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest is not worthy of them or a show that might create more excitement out of more mundane activities if it dialed back the high drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, Weber's choreography is a real asset, with a clever little dance involving people who are seated (very Spring Awakening ) and a lot of fine work with the ensemble that is memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Michael Alvarez deals with the many changes in scene and mood with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And full points to scenic andcostume designer John Dunnett who took one look at this attractive cast and realized sometimes less ismore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STEALING TIME ** PEARL THEATRE COMPANY ON 42ND ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This song cycle is the first presentation of a show about two married people who meet and fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's almost charming that the show notes think such a concept borders on the controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Married people having an affair and leaving their spouse for someone new and perhaps this being a good thing for almost all involved? Frankly, it would only be controversial if a show said that cheating on your spouse wasn'tliberating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music and lyrics are by Tor Hyams and Lisa Neubauer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hyams was at NYMF last year with Greenwood and this is a notable step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of songs rely on a sudden, unexpected ending for dramatic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But by and large they're stronger and more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only notable relapseinto the psycho-therapeutic lyrics of Greenwood appear right near the finale when Maya sings that "I'm coming home to me!" Otherwise, the open-hearted "Wake Up" and "Out In the Open" may be self-consciously "big" numbers but they come close to delivering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still as with Rio and Trouble , the show is at its best when being light-hearted, such as the "Maybe, Maybe Not" (in which the two philandering couples detail their flaws to discourage romance) and the amusing "Dance Of Lies Tango." Andrew Redlawsk (one of the best things about Greenwood ) also does nicely in his duet where the kids affected by divorce get to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The large cast of performers meant six different people tackled songs by both Ben and Maya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tunes themselves may have blended together a bit but that was minimized by this decision to let numerousvoices (such as Rachel York and Jeremy Kushnier) add their own personalities to the parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It might bethat with just one actor in each part that the sameness of some of the songs might be more pronounced.At this stage, the projection design of Stephen Arnoczy was a notable asset, with visuals that workednicely to accent the storyline and emotional turmoil of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no question that StealingTime is a step forward from Greenwood .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hyams and Neubauer don't quite fly away but they're learning to spread their wings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
