                <p>DVDs: Horrible Hobbit , Great Day- Lewis, Treacly Life of Pi and More Oscar Faves Hit Stores A flood of Oscar winners, nominees and those that should have been hit stores in the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a rundown of recent new films that have just debuted on DVD and BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY ($35.99 BluRay combo; MGM/Warner Bros.) -- The Hobbit will go down in history as the first film releasedcommercially in 48 fps, an innovation that will soon jump probably to 64 fps or some other standard but which may very well become as common as color and sound is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 3-Dhowever, remains a gimmick that will soon fadeagain except for big blockbuster films thatsomehow justify the cost for their thrill rides.Sadly, these are the most important detailsabout The Hobbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy and consider it a landmark filmachievement and easily one of the greatestfantasy works of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hobbit is as complete a fall from grace as Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was from the original George Lucas trilogy, right down to the annoying minor character inserted for comic relief and to amuse the kiddies (Jar Jar Binks in one,Radagast the Brown in the other).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I watched it in both formats (3-D and 2-D) in thetheaters but don't think I can bring myself to watch it a third time and detail the manyjaw-droppingly bad artistic choices, from the video game chase in the realm of the GreatGoblin to having Thorin hug Bilbo with all the gusto of a guest on "Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil." And I couldrattle off the dwarves in order of their arrival at Bag End.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extras are voluminous andthe movie is presented with care, though doubtless you'll be enticed by even more bonusfeatures once all three films are released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll see them all but I'm not looking forward toit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing in 2012 disappointed me more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LINCOLN ($39.99 BluRay combo; DreamWorks/FOX) -- What a remarkableperformance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln,though to call it a performance is already tocheapen his accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You simply watchthe film and wonder how they got Lincoln onthe set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Day-Lewis captures an idea of Lincolnwith complexity, warmth and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's apity his work is wasted on a rather routineperiod drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The middle section is a betterthan average episode of The West Wing as Lincoln and his compatriots push for the passage of the 13th Amendment. (That's aMay 7, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 03/27/2013 5:47 pmcompliment, by the way.) The flag-waving, pointless introduction, the condescendingappearances by totems of African-American respectability and the pointlessly drawn-out final act of the film that trudges through the end of the war and (spoiler alert!) Lincoln's assassination all spoil the modest pleasures in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Day-Lewis created a livingbreathing person; director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner immediatelyembalm him in piety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RUST AND BONE ($35.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics) -- An art house favorite, Rustand Bone is essentially a woman's picture, a weepie about a heroine who overcomes tragedyto triumph, namely an accident that leaves herparalyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the rough outline, though youalmost don't realize it while watching the filmbecause it's made with such maturity andcomplexity by the great French director JacquesAudiard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion Cotillard and MatthiasSchoenaerts are superb as the woman facing alife-changing blow and the man who has notime for self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adult fare in the best sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LES MISERABLES ($34.99 BluRay combo; Universal) -- Oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Les Miserables the musical has never been treated kindly by critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It opened to poor reviews in London butaudiences flocked immediately and it became a worldwide sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've seen the musicalseveral times and love the score, though the subsequent work by the creators has beenalmost universally dreadful (including Miss Saigon ) and gives me pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This film version won't help matters, since the casting in classic Hollywood style has been done to maximize star power and minimize singing ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a musical, for heaven's sake! One major actorwho can charm and talk-sing their way through a part? Fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this version has wall towall stars who simply can't do justice to the roles, including Russell Crowe, Sacha BaronCohen, Helena Bonham Carter, and, yes, Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most ofthem can't sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hathaway gets by and seems the shining star compared to the rest but Ican't imagine anyone listening to a real Broadway star belting out "I Dreamed a Dream" and preferring Hathaway. (Cue the comments.) Jackman is a very appealing performer whose on-stage magnetism has never remotely been captured on film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to see him in Pal Joey or numerous other shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he has a light, pleasant voice when Jean Valjean demands a Wotan of massive, belting power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you could have the best singers in the world and it wouldn't matter when director Tom Hooper seemed determined to shoot the film in haphazard style with TV-like close-ups dominating what should be an epic film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of satisfying me, it makes me long for the new Broadway production coming in 2014 so I can hear real singers belt out those songs once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZERO DARK THIRTY ($40.99 BluRay combo; Sony) -- This isn't an authorized workbut you wouldn't know it from the hagiographyat work here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our heroine seems to be the onlyone in government who is not a dunce headand remains focused like a laser on capturingOsama Bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those criticizing the film forits politics are surely misguided -- whatever theorder of scenes, the movie is clearly reachingfor a moral complexity about how the war andmanhunt were implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is no rah-rah,ain't torture grand movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For all its flaws, ithas an intelligence and scope that keep themovie watchable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jessica Chastain holds ittogether ably as the driven intelligenceoperative though Jason Clarke is the one that stayed with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THIS MUST BE THE PLACE ($29.99 BLURAY; Anchor Bay) -- What an oddballdelight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Penn places a burned out, AndyWarhol-like rocker who lives in Dublin with hisfirefighter wife (Frances McDorman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He rushesback to the US, too late to say goodbye to hisdying father and then heads out on a road tripto track down an aging Nazi war criminalhiding in America and thus fulfill his dad'sdying wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's as nutty as it sounds.Director Paolo Sorrentino follows in thefootsteps of many Europeans who make moviesset in America. it feels like someone fromanother planet discovering a place that issomewhat similar to but oddly different from the place you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penn walks a tightrope with his truly off kilter hero, a sweetly daffy soul who is far more perceptive than most people assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If anyone had paid attention tothe film, he surely would have won an Oscar nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans won't want to miss it.Others will wonder what the heck they're watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIFE OF PI ($39.99 BluRay combo; FOX) -- I didn't finish the novel Life Of Pi (and I rarelystop reading anything) so if you loved the book, you can ignore me starting...now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The featurefilm version by one of my favorite directors,Ang Lee, was praised for its 3-D and gorgeousfairy tale look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought this parable about ayoung man on a small boat with a Bengal tigerwas dripping in goopy, pretty colors, like an episode of My Little Pony come to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 3-D was a complete waste of time, amounting to pointless distraction in the bookend scenes(gee, that fridge really looks like it's a few feetbehind the actor) and lame moments in the heart of the tale (like having the tiger's paw come out towards the audience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiences -- more than critics -- however, really embraced the novel and film and it's certainly a lovingly edition with some solid making-of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ability to watch it without 3-D is a decided bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EASY MONEY ($24.99 DVD; Anchor Bay) -- This twisty Swedish noir was one of the undiscovered gems of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A college studentfalls in with a rich crowd and turns to crime tomaintain a facade of wealth and ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hebecomes entangled with a fugitive from thecops and the Mob enforcer who wants tocapture the rogue first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smart and great fun, it'sbased on a trilogy of crime novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can onlyassume the English language remake is alreadyin the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watch this so you can see the newversion and say confidently, "The original wasbetter." THE INTOUCHABLES ($35.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics) -- One of the truly hateful films of the year, The Intouchables was an improbable worldwide smash hit that trafficsin the most offensive racial stereotypes imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that the film has an earnestheart and thinks it is making a plea for racial understanding makes it all the morenoxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A paralyzed white man of wealth (Francois Cluzet) hires a poor, uneducated ex-con (Omar Sy) because he's the only one that doesn't treat Cluzet with pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The white people are uptight and listen to classical music and go to the opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The black guy is afunky life force who gets them to boogie down to soul music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The white guy exposes the black guy to the world of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The black guy of course is closer to the life force andactually enjoys life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cluzet and Sy, unfortunately, are very talented actors and makethis dreck seem almost acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINISTER ($39.99 BluRay combo; Summit) -- Trust Ethan Hawke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he does a B movie horror flick, you can bet hesusses one out with a decent script and an emphasis onatmosphere and creepiness rather than the slasher porn thatdominates these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of the genre repeatedly singled it outto me as a cut well above the low-brow horror flicks that seem tocome out almost every week during the slow months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HITCHCOCK ($39.99 BluRay combo; FOX) -- Watching a genius at work would make for a fascinating film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, Hitchcock is more interested in pop psychology and the off camera life of Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife (Helen Mirren) ratherthan an exploration of the making of Psycho .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The master would be mortified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, youcan ignore this (and the misguided Bates Motel ) and actually watch Psycho and Rear Window and Vertigo and North By Northwest and The Lady Vanishes and The 39 Steps and Shadow Of A Doubt and Rebecca and don't you dare watch this unless you've already seen them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WRECK-IT RALPH ($49.99 BluRay combo; Disney) RISE OF THE GUARDIANS ($54.99 BluRay combo; DreamWorks Animation) -- Two animated films that fall short, proving again how good Pixar was at its best. (And yes, Iput that in the past tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm getting worried about them.) Despite its video game setting,Wreck-It Ralph is a by-the-numbers tale of a character who gets lost and then returns home again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's main virtues are some fine vocal work by Sarah Silverman and JaneLynch but the story is too routine to hold your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least it feels like a workreaching for originality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guardians , on the other hand, is too desperate to launch a franchise to worry about things like characters and story and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wanted to launchan Avengers -like team including holiday stars like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best extra comes on Ralph , which includes the Oscar- winning short Paperman .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As long as works of originality are being done in the shorts, we can hope for another great animated film sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THIS IS 40 ($34.99 BluRay combo; Universal) -- This spin-off from Knocked-Up was uncalled for and unasked for, though it's still fitfully fun to see Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as a married couple that can tear into each other with glee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the slapped-together nature of the project is belied by the absurd 134 minute running time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like everyone involved but they're trying my patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The few genuine pleasures come courtesy of Albert Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isn't it about time he give another project of his own? KILLING THEM SOFTLY ($39.99 BluRay combo; Anchor Bay/Weinstein) RED DAWN ($39.99 Bluray combo; FOX) -- Two disappointments of very different sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After The Hobbit , the movie that let me down the most was Andrew Domink's Killing ThemSoftly . it's based on a terrific crime novel that is bursting with hilarious, can't miss dialogue andvivid characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But somehow the film doesmiss from beginning to end, starting with themodest but unnecessary change in time and theaddition of a mild political overlay that isdistracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even still, virtually nothing hereholds the attention despite a cast and crew thaton paper is faultless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dominik's Chopper was agreat debut that launched Eric Bana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford gave Brad Pitt one of his best parts and Casey Affleck the role of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's one of the best films of the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I'm sure Dominik will deliver again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I justhope we don't have to wait five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Red Dawn on the other hand was an unnecessary remake of a fun little B movie I always liked defending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this revisit failed to deepenthe characters or explore the moral complexity of a rebellion when your country is beingoccupied, the sort of layering that a remake and times demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead it was just witlessfun that has me rethinking my appreciation of the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm almost afraid to go backand watch it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THIS IS NOT A FILM ($19.99 DVD; Palisades Tartan) -- Finally, here is a thoroughly original work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part protest, part documentary, part essay, Iranian director Jafar Panahi hasresponded to a ban on making films by starring in a work that "isnot a film." Don't believe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He shows the next film he wantedto make and discusses camera angles and the such by placingtape on the floor of his home and spelling it all out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This iscaptured on a cell phone and edited into the work we have here.Silencing people has never been more technologically impossiblethan it is today as this unique film amply demonstrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hate it when people call actors or filmmakers "brave" for playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, cops and soldiersand firemen who risk their lives are brave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing a part on stage or film is not brave.Here's the exception to the rule. ***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiple combinations,including DVD, Blu-ray, digital download, video on demand, streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theformat listed is the format provided for review, not all the formats available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is oftenthe most expensive version with the most extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do check individual titles foravailability in all their various guises and price points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-rays with the understanding that he would be considering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does notguarantee to review and he receives far more titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz</p>
