"All The Light We Cannot See" is a romantic, moving tale that spansdecades but mostly covers the years before and during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I say romantic, but it's not a romance withsweeping passions and a happy ending or even a nicely bittersweet sad one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a full-bodied work that deliversmany indelible characters but switches back and forth especially between two: a young blind French girl being raisedby her single father amidst the rarified world of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and an orphan boy inGermany struggling to survive in a coal-mining town with his sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel begins with D-Day where the boyWerner is a radio operator of sorts trapped in the basement of a hotel on the coast of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The girl Marie-Laure isnearby, hiding in a home as bombs fall and a German officer obsessed with the fabled diamond the Sea Of Flamesseeks her out. (The diamond was spirited away from her father's museum workplace, along with countless othervaluables.) How melodramatic this sounds, but this sure-footed, absorbing tale is wonderfully detailed and alivewithout ever succumbing to flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So much of it sticks in your mind: the training school where Werner's gifts forscience are exploited, the detailed model of Marie-Laure's neighborhood lovingly crafted by her father, the elderlywomen of Saint-Malo who resist the Nazis in small ways and soon graduate to large ones, the giant of a soldier whobefriends Werner, the sad wreck of an uncle who hides away from the world but comes out of his shell for Marie-Laure and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, there's a...a generosity of spirit, a kindness that permeates this work that comfortseven as it delivers some hard truths about the brutality of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a triumph. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Exquisite…Mesmerizing…Nothing short of brilliant.” - Alice EvansPortland Oregonian“Hauntingly beautiful.” - Janet MaslinThe New York Times“History intertwines with irresistible fiction—secret radio broadcasts, a cursed diamond, a soldier’s deepest doubts—into a richly compelling, bittersweet package.” - Mary PolsPeople (3 1/2 stars)“Anthony Doerr again takes language beyond mortal limits.” - Elissa SchappellVanity Fair“The whole enthralls.” - Good Housekeeping“Enthrallingly told, beautifully written…Every piece of back story reveals information that charges the emergingnarrative with significance, until at last the puzzle-box of the plot slides open to reveal the treasure hidden inside.” -Amanda VaillWashington Post“Stupendous…A beautiful, daring, heartbreaking, oddly joyous novel.” - David LaskinThe Seattle Times“Stunning and ultimately uplifting… Doerr’s not-to-be-missed tale is a testament to the buoyancy of our dreams,carrying us into the light through the darkest nights.” - Entertainment Weekly</p>
