"To the left of myhouse is a deejay, and to the right is a drummer," says Romer, whose new CD, "TWo New Sciences!" is just out.It's in- spired by some of his musical touchstones, like David Bowie's "The Rise and FalI ofZiggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars" and the Who's "TommY."A jazz kid grows up Eldar is settling into a six-night stand at the Blue Note startingAug. 28 just as he's settling into a new apartment in Morning- side Heights. "I've got a greatview," says Eldar. "I'm not looking at 4 s,'all." Limitless horizons have seemed to al- ways be ahead of this accomplished 20- year-old pianist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 10, his family moved from Kyrgyzstan in the Soviet Union to Kansas City so Eldar - clearly a child prodigy - could pursue his studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I-at- er he moved to L.A. and now New York, all while recording three albums for Sony Masterworks, two dominated by stan- dards (including 2006's "Live at the Blue Note') and now "Re-Imagination," his boldest effort yet.

"I saw David Byrne riding on his bike one time, and one of my friends screamed out, 'David! David!' and he pulled over," says Romer. "Ev- eryone else said something cool and I just said, '...You're my idol.' He didn't know what to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think I made him nervous."

"Most of the time I don't like to really talk about it," says Eldar, whose last name is Djangirov.
