CHIMPANZEE ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- The political documentary 2016: Obama's America is a huge hit for a film in its genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's crazy to say it's the top documentary film of the year... except for nature documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the caveat news outlets must make, which is kind of like saying a movieis the top family film of the year... except for animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or the top drama of the year... except forones with vampires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, the top documentary of the year so far is Chimpanzee , the latest in what is proving an annual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year around Earth Day, Disney releases a new documentary about ourworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This latest was directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, both of whom can be found onthe credits of some of the best documentaries in history, namely the Blue Planet and Planet Earth TV shows and their theatrical spinoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one isn't quite up to the level of those, but it's an engaging lookat the life of a little chimpanzee from birth through traumatic events and the possibility of a happyfuture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parents beware: nature throws our hero Oscar a few Bambi -like curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's presented as gently as possible but is there nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The very sensitive and the very young might be upset by thoseMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Mitt Romney To Flood Victim: 'Go Home And Call 211' Former 'SNL' Star Makes Shocking Comments About Rape And Gay Friends Paul Ryan Admits Marathon Lie What's Up With Those Circular Marks On Curiosity?

But, boy is it a great album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been 20 years and people need to take a deep breath,listen to this album with fresh ears and realize what a landmark it is, every bit the equal of Wilco'sYankee Hotel Foxtrot, Radiohead's Kid A and other oddball classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's lyrical, shimmering, strange, lovely and haunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can rock out to the CD (headphones preferred, thank you very much) or youcan buy the DVD and enjoy a live performance with the album played in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band is at the peak of their powers (though I'd love to see them again today -- they're touring on their own and with Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse, which is a terrific double bill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The live DVD isn't edited crazily like so many concert films and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can watch just the concert or a fuller version along withinterviews and other extras wrapped around the performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any format, you'll appreciate anew agreat American band and their greatest album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSE SEASON EIGHT ($74.98 BluRay; Universal) THE CLOSER SEVENTH SEASON ($59.98 DVD; Warner Bros.) GLEE THIRD SEASON ($59.98 DVD; FOX) MIKE &amp; MOLLY SEASON TWO ($44.98 DVD: Warner Bros.) MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS SEASON 1 VOLUME 1 ($19.93 DVD; Shout) REVENGE FIRST SEASON ($45.99 DVD: ABC) DOCTOR WHO: THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE GALAXY /DOCTOR WHO: SPEARHEAD FROM SPACE ($24.98 each on DVD; BBC) -- It's hard to know when to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; House clearly got it wrong; one season earlier and I think fans and critics would have mourned the show more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it was, eight seasons was clearly more than enough, though that doesn't dim Hugh Laurie's fun in creating oneof TV's most indelible pains in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Closer , however, got it just right, with the show leaving at the top of its game ratings-wise and Kyra Sedgwick brandishing that crazy Southern accent to great effectright up to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glee can't say goodbye because it has something to prove after a creatively disastrous season two and a not much better season three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like clingy parents, they refuse to let go of key charactersafter they graduate and that does not bode well for season four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here's hoping they get back on track.(Start by insisting the songs actually have something to do with the scenes at hand, guys!) Mike &amp; Molly moved a bit beyond the incessant fat jokes to allow Melissa McCarthy to blossom even more as a full- bodied woman in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of Power Rangers are ga-ga for the 20th anniversary reunion that's going to bring together every surviving Power Ranger that they can for the ultimate showdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until then, thehardcore fans can begin again where it all started with this economical first half of season one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains 30 episodes and no frills but who needs frills when you've got the MMPRs? The guilty pleasure of last season deserves a wider audience and this DVD release of Season One of Revenge leaves you no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I continue to plead for complete boxed sets for each Doctor, but fans will enjoy these single releases of prior Doctor Who adventures with entire tales and loads (I do mean loads) ofextras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What better way to prep for the new season starting Saturday on BBC America? GOOD WILL HUNTING ($14.99 BluRay; Miramax/Lionsgate) -- This is a corny sentimental film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if it makes you cry, who am I to spoil your pleasure? And it made Oscar-winning stars out of MattDamon and Ben Affleck, both of whom have acquitted themselves very nicely as actors and in Affleck'scase especially as a director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, it gave the very talented director Gus Van Sant a dualtrack of intriguing indies and bland studio pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since he uses his Hollywood juice to make flickslike Elephant , at least he's used his power for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I still quote the "How do you like them apples?" line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE NY GIANTS ($26.97 DVD; NFL/Vivendi) -- This is a rerelease of the 2004 documentary about the Giants, modestly updated to fill in the last eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strictly forfans, though NFL Films always has great footage you've never seen before in their releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You used tohave to wait for a weekend TV broadcast; now fans can enjoy their access any time.THE DICTATOR ($39.99 BluRay combo; Paramount) SPACEBALLS ($19.99 BluRay; MGM) POST MORTEM ($$29.95 DVD: Kino Lorber) -- What's a comedy? Here are three pretty radically different responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sacha Baron Cohen likes to mix the forms of reality TV when mining his cultural collisions between Western society and the "foreign," in this case a brutal dictator who is deposed andmust go to work in a health food store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure he and Mel Brooks would get along mightily, but Brooksis doing a very different sort of comedy with Spaceballs , his spoof of Star Wars and Alien and Indiana Jones and anything else that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'd rather trade in one top drawer joke for ten cheap onesbecause a laugh is a laugh, right? Young Frankenstein it ain't but time has actually helped this one not seem so out of step because when it first came out Star Wars seemed to be pretty passe as a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the very (very) different comedy Post Mortem is the second in a trilogy of films looking at Chilethrough a mordant, unexpected lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It focuses on a man who takes notes during autopsies but is oftendaydreaming about his leftist neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the government is overthrown, the bodies of hercompatriots begin to dominate his job and the man can't keep political reality at bay any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one, I think, would like all three of these films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hearing who likes which two and why would be fascinating.MY SON JOHN ($29.95 BluRay; Olive/Paramount) CAPTAIN CAREY U.S.A. ($29.95 BluRay; Olive/Paramount) PRIVATE HELL 36 ($29.95 BluRay; Olive/Paramount) -- Another batch of catalog titles from Paramount rescued and brought to life by Olive Films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My Son John is a relic of the Cold War, with parents Helen Hayes and Dean Jagger petrified that their eldest is a dirty commie. it's especially notable for being the final film of Robert Walker, who died during production at the age of 32 years old, onereason at least the film is unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Ladd is very satisfying in Captain Carey, in which a WW II operative returns to his stomping ground in Italy and discovers there are still wrongs to be righted anddeaths to be avenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, there's the trim noir Private Hell 36 in which two cops keep a stash of money from a crime and are ridden with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ida Lupino co-wrote and stars; the more I see of herfascinating career, the more I like her. ***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiple combinations, includingDVD, Blu-ray, digital download, video on demand, streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The format listed is theformat provided for review, not all the formats available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is often the most expensive version with themost extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do check individual titles for availability in all their various guises and price points.FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Kellan Lutz On 'Twilight': 'I Didn't Like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guy Pearce 'Prometheus' Deleted Scene: 'They Could...
