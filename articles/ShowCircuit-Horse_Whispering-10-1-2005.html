The esteemed house of Cartier takes the accessory­ as-statement a giant step for­ ward with the creation of a new version of the Cartier Roadster Watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Made of stainless steel and featuring a pink dial accented with subtle pink ribbons, this limited edi­ tion Roadster is sure to be­ come an instant classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The watch was specially designed to benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and will be available in October at Cartier boutiques and autho­ rized dealers nationwide for $3,800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For further informa­ tion, visit www.cartier.com or call 800-CARTIER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HELPING HANDS: For those in the mood to raise money and have fun at the same time, the Equestrian AIDS Foundation will hold its third annual fundraiser on Thurs­ day, November 10, at 6:30 P.M. in Los Angeles at Amici Brentwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Featuring in­ credible auction items such as phenomenal VIP packages to American Idol tapings and the Billboard Music Awards, proceeds will benefit EAF and those affected by the re­ cent hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For further information call 800-792- 6068.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking ahead, Show Circuit hears that some of our aware young riders are joining "The Ride for Hope;' a youth effort that is being spearheaded by Brianne Goutal and Carolyn Kelley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More on this in our Winter issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHAPOT HANGS UP HIS CHAPEAU: The horsing world bid a fond farewell to the beloved US Equestrian Team coach and show jump­ ing chef d' equipe Frank Chapot at a competition in Monmouth County, New Jer­ sey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After 25 years with the USET, Chapot bid adieu to his formal role in a sport he loves so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chapot com­ peted in numerous Olympics (peaking with five consecu­ tive appearances) and used that invaluable experience to lead teams he coached to . achieve excellence, exempli­ fied by nine Olympic medals (most recently a silver at Athens) and nine Pan Ameri­ can Game medals (including the team gold at the 2003 Pan Am Games).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The USET Foundation appropriately named Chapot a recipient of its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chapot's legacy will live on, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the very event where he made a public farewell, Chapot's daughter Laura won the Grand Prix with Sprite and a few hours later took second with Samantha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hats off to them both! MORE MARGIE: Margie Goldstein has an unparal­ leled record as a show jumper: AGA Rider of the Year numerous times, the most grand prix wins in his­ tory and all-time money winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now we heard that her mother Mona's self-pub­ lished biography of her daughter-No Hurdle Too High-has been reissued by a major publishing house (Lyons Press) in a new ex- No Hurdle Too High panded hardcover edition for $24.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with continu- ing the story of Margie's ca- reer from 2001 (when the first edition came out) to the present, the book has beefed up information on the tech- niques and skills that made her a champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mona is also thrilled about a three-book deal she has signed to write historical fiction for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linda Eder HIT SINGER HITS THE ROAD: Broadway star Linda Eder is famous for her devoted fans and performances in hit mu- sicals like Jekyll &amp; Hyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less- known, however, is that she is also a passionate equestrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eder will celebrate that pas- sion with Trail MIX, a new show debuting on Animal Planet in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eder will travel the world to talk with all sorts of artists and hear their stories of how com- muning with horses is a con- stant source of creativity for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eder's profile should be higher than ever when the special airs, given that the broadcast follows the Octo- ber release of By Myself The Music of Judy Garland on Angel Records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOW CIRCUIT @ FALL 2005 DISCOVER THIS: Noticing far more film cameras and cam- era crews at Indoors and other major shows this season?
