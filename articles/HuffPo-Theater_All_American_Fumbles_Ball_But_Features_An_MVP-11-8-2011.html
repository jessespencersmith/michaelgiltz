(I felt this even before seeing the video above.) it would be easy to say Forlenza looks more like a head cheerleader than a quarterback buteven that doesn't seem quite right since cheerleading can is a physically demanding skill, especially at the competitive level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forlenza's brief moments handling a ball only reinforce the idea of how ill-suited she is for this role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katie needn't be mannish, but surely a more physically imposing and buff actress could befound to give the character at least a modicum of believability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this is Forlenza's fault, though her performance in the dramatic scenes is equally unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blame Brownell since for a quarterback Katie is an awfully passive character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even when she startshanging out and apparently sleeping with her fellow teammates (a situation ripe with intriguing possibilities), nothing comes of it that's interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brock Harris is fine in the small role of a teammate and he nails his one bit of humor with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sets by Lee Savage and lighting by Japhy Weideman (they're inextricably linked) are a highlight, with a football field inevitably the focus of the floor, a kitchen on one side and bed/high school locker area onthe other and elegant but piercing lights on wooden frames at both ends sharply illuminating the action.Jill BC Duboff's sound design is invisible, as it should be, discretely creating the murmur and roar of practice and games taking place out of our vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The direction by Evan Cabnet is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he and the LCT3 team should have done more to workshop All-American and find its focus by either tackling the gimmicky topic at hand (a barrier-breaking female quarterback) or playing to its strengths even more, namely the talented and impressive Zittel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Chinglish * 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Godspell ** 1/2 Hair *** MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
