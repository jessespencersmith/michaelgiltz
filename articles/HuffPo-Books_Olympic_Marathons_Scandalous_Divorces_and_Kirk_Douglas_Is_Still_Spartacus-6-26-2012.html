paperbackOpen Road Kirk Douglas is the author of numerous best-selling memoirs and works of fiction, especially his acclaimed first work, The Ragman's Son .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've read none of them but that will change after I devoured this breezy, entertaining, and fascinating look at the making of Spartacus .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 95 year old actor, producer and writer has presumably expanded on earlier tellings of the making of one of his most significant hits.It's available as a paperback but is an ebook, which frees up Douglas to tell the story at just the rightlength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Movie buffs shouldn't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins with a look at the House Committee on Un-American Activities and ends with President Kennedy slipping into the back of a movie theater to watch the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In between Douglas charts themovie's torturous path, from facing off with another similar project, hiring and firing a director, hiringand firing a leading lady, dealing with the egos of Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton AND PeterUstinov, not to mention a young Stanley Kubrick, risking his personal fortune and the fate of a studio (Universal), all while clandestinely using the skills of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo who had been unofficially blacklisted by Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas turned 41 in the midst of all this and he isn't shy about showing his own less pleasant side, whether it's getting angry over editing, squaring off with Kubrick when the director didn't want to shootthe "I am Spartacus" scene or playing hardball with the suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he seems the sort of fellow who lovestelling a story that rebounds on himself more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas is polite but not -- at 95 -- undulycircumspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not looking to make anyone bad but he's going to tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I loved the scene where Douglas is asking Olivier if he'd like to star (as Crassus) and direct the film, thinking the offer to direct would entice the actor into the secondary role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Olivier assumes he would direct and play Spartacus (a role he was hopelessly ill-suited for) and accepts readily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglaswisely stays mum, figuring correctly that Olivier would reconsider one or the other and ultimately Olivierhas to back out due to theater commitments but suggests himself for Crassus, the role Douglas had in mind for him all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, Douglas doesn't ever paint himself as heroic in putting Trumbo into the credits of the film, breaking the blacklist once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just spells out how it happened, with each step leading inevitably to the next until finally it just seemed silly NOT to put Trumbo in the credits (it was an open secret at that point) but without ever downplaying the importance of it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spartacus happened to be the first film I saw when I moved to New York City (a restoration given a grand premiere at the Ziegfeld) but it's not even remotely close to my favorite of Douglas or Kubrick. (I'll take Ace In The Hole and 2001: A Space Odyssey , thank you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the making of it has produced an even better book all these years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOWDOWN AT SHEPHERD'S BUSH By David Davis *** out of **** $25.99; hardcover Thomas Dunne Books/St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin's Press I don't know if I would have the strength to watch a marathon, much less run one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I have two sisters who have conquered it repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that they can compete in marathons all over the country is directly due to the modern Olympics, a proposition that was struggling until the revival/invention of the marathon sent the public into a frenzy, produced the first world famous Olympian and sparked a craze that endures to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story of the marathon is well told in this model of a sports book by David Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subtitled "The 1908 Olympic Marathon and the Three Runners Who Launched A Sporting Craze," it does just that, takingwell-timed jaunts off the beaten path to give vivid descriptions of the three runners who would battlemost fiercely for the top prize, the promoters who created and fought over the Olympics, the nutty ideasabout fitness that prevailed at the time (Drink water while running? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beer or liquor? Yes!) The three runners who converged on the 1908 Olympics (and would then square off against each other in various permutations for the next few years while fans breathlessly bet on the winner and wondered ifone of them might die in the attempt) are all fascinating characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnny Hayes is an Irish Americanracing through the streets of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dorando Pietri is an Italian who was frustrated when Italy failed to host the Olympics and the venue was switched to England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Longboat is an Onandaga Indian from Canada both celebrated and patronized by his own country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entire book was filled with suspense for me since I didn't know the first thing about the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's one of the most famous moments in Olympic history: Dorando staggered into the stadium, punch drunkwith weariness, staggering towards the finish line in front of a packed audience and the Queen OfDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 7 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2Kyra Sedgwick on "The Possession" Kim Kardashian Wants a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame First Video of Snooki WithHer New Baby Boy What's Your Favorite Michael Jackson Memory?

This would mean Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robinson was the most vile creature that ever lived (I am not exaggerating the condemnation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And this was too much to bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was easier for all involved to simply believe Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robinson was either mentally deranged or lying, using her diary for a nascent literary effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The possibility that it could betrue was inconceivable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the diary was dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic and Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robinson herselfclaimed it was all fantasy to protect the man and family she had dragged into this scandal despite theirmany kindnesses to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And society breathed a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tale sometimes brings laughter over how backwards the attitudes towards women were in those not- so-distant days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the vivid peeks into the Victorian sensibility are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a slowbeginning and a slow finale with numerous side-trackings along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robinson's disgracedeserves the pulse-pounding pleasure of a melodrama but it's been delivered here in measured, drytones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOOKS I'VE READ SO FAR IN 2012 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Underneath by Kathi Appelt *** 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jack Holmes and His Friend by Edmund White ***3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Last Unicorn by Peter S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beagle **4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fun Home by Alison Bechdel ***5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Death Walks In Eastrepp by Francis Beeding ***6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lumious Airplanes by Paul La Farge ***/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Professionals by Owen Laukkanen ** 1/28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unterzakhn by Leela Corman **9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Child Who by Simon Lelic ***10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hinterland by Caroline Brothers ***11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Yard by Alex Grecian *** 1/212.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Alienist by Caleb Carr ***13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On The Wings Of Heroes by Richard Peck *** 1/214.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Princess Of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs *15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gods Of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs **16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Warlord Of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs ** 1/2 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Undefeated: America's Heroic Fight For Bataan and Corregidor by Bill Sloan ** 1/2 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stoner by John Williams ****19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sisters Brothers by Patrick DeWitt *** 1/220.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 500 by Matthew Quirk **21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Age Of Innocence by Edith Wharton ****22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Alienist by Caleb Carr ***\FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...
