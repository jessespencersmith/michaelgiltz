(What guy can complain about it, since if they see themselves in itthey are damning their own doggy ways?) Truth and better-than-truth (i.e. fiction) merge here, with Parker's adoptionof a child in Africa to imagining herself talking to that oyster man in a cinematic scene where they are watched from adistance, the actual words she says lost in the noise of the surf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker nails details of acting school with deadpanhilarity, skewers herself happily, celebrates her children and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't find any dissection of hermany theatrical triumphs or dishing of backstage dirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather marvelously, "Dear Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You" is both disarmingly intimate(I feel like I know her) and a bravura performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And isn't that what great acting (and great writing) are oftenabout? This is her first book but surely not her last. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Mary-Louise Parker’s Dear Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You is straight-up fantastic; a gripping and deeply humane and often hilarious book.It catches glimpses of life at all sorts of unexpected moments, electrifying them with its sharp-eyed astonishment athow absurd and joyous things can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There’s nothing cheaply-earned about its wonder; nothing sugarcoated in itsgratitude.It’s all grit, all messy particulars—full of surprise and full-throated in its song.” - Leslie Jamison, author ofThe Empathy Exams“To have an artist accomplished in one genre triumph in another—seemingly out of the blue—is an extraordinaryevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary-Louise Parker’s Dear Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You is a pants-pissingly funny, gut-wrenching meditation on her loving andtormented encounters with the masculine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From grandfather to father to son to the wacky, pre-Burning Man hippiewith a loincloth who haunts her at a co-op job to the lover who deserves the coda ‘Sleep tight, little monster.’ Whetherhonoring the ash-covered firefighter she sees on 9/11 or shouting as a crazy person at her malignantly lost cabdriver,Parker merges memoir with poetry in this haunting, sui generis work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I drank it down in one gulp,…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
