That hilarious and tough-minded book is about a kid who made the bold move to attendan all-white public school and thus symbolically leave the rez (knowing in a way it would mean he would some day literally leave the reservation for good and become an urban Indian).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's somewhat autobiographical and for fans who have read it,Share This Book About The Author Sherman Alexie MoreWinner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the PEN/Malamud Award for Short Fiction, a PEN/Hemingway Citation for BestFirst Fiction, and the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, Sherman Alexie is a poet, short story writer, novelistand performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Spokane/Couer d'AleneIndian, Alexie â€¦ Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: June 13, 2017 Publisher: Little, Brown and Company Pages: 464 ISBN 10: 031627075X ISBN 13: 9780316270755this memoir is a funhouse mirror, as stories we have heard pop up but sometimes end differently or are sadder or rawer in ways that a (still pretty harsh) young adult book would not be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this isn't a memoir covering Alexie's whole life so muchas circling around and coming to grips with the complicated relationship he had with his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is the beating heart, the inscrutable mystery and the reason for this work by the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It offers up poetry and stories and facts and descriptions of Sherman and his siblings debating what was and wasn't about their mother and theirlives. (For those fabulists who just make stuff up, this is how it's done by artists and people who relish the truth -- lay it allout there.) Among the many heartbreaking details is the fact that his mother was the child of rape, a fact that Alexie typically zeroes in on with empathy -- did his grandmother see the rapist in his mother's face? Did that make her love his mother more, less or differently? And yet he takes in the wider scope, seeing Native Americans as a people defined by rapeand brutality, from the white school teachers who literally beat their students and forced them into positions later seen astorture (Alexie got sick when he first saw photos from Abu Ghraib because it reminded him of school) to the wider rape oftheir land and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an essay, a memoir, a history, a cry from the heart, a challenge to other Indians and a baring of his soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, by insisting on the unvarnished truth, it is an honor song to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poems can be found throughout but it's poetry from start to finish. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Praise for YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME: - "With brazen honesty and humor throughout, Alexie writes about the many facets of his mother and her addiction's effect on his family and childhood."
