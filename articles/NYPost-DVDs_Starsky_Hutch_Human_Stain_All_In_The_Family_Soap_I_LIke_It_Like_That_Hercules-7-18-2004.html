'­o &gt; ~ Starsky &amp; Hutch * * * z Warner Bros., $27.95 Great casting, just the right tone; a cameo from the original stars and it's all over in 100 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just the one hilarious scene with Hutch on a couch with two girls he encourages to kiss makes it all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extras include the usual gag reel and deleted scenes, with a brief mockumentary where everyone jokes about having a miserable time on the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out: "Starsky &amp; Hutch: Complete Second Season" (Columbia TriStar, $49.95).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Human Stain ** Miramax, $29.99 You know something is up when a pedigreed film like this (acclaimed novel by Philip Roth, starry cast featuring Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman) offers virtually no extras for the DVD of this drama about a black college professor who passes for white but is ironically accused of racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No commentary track and the briefest of featurettes? This is one noble failure they clearly wanted to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allin The Family: Third Season / Soap: Second Season ****/*** Columbia TriStar, $29.95 each What seemed shocking 20 years ago can seem awfully lame today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But these two groundbreaking series still stand tall because of sterling writing and a desire to do more than just offend, ''All in the Family" has great characters - including a bigot you love to watch make a fool of himself. "Soap" seems a little rickety now (their budgets were awfully low), but the budding cast (Billy Crystal, Robert -Guillaume, Katherine Helmond) made the most of a spoof Mel Brooks would have been proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I Like It Like That *** Columbia TriStar, $19.95 Female directors still struggle, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1994, Darnell Martin wrote and directed this gem starring Lauren Velez as a struggling Bronx mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It got strong reviews, but she's been mostly helming episodes of TV shows like "Oz" and "ER" ever since. (Her upcoming TV movie, "Her Eyes Were Watching God" with Halle Berry, should change that.) Also check out "Seaside," (First Run, $29.95), the quiet French drama written and directed by Julie Lopez-Curval that won a top prize at Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hercules: Season Four **1/2 Anchor Bay, $69.98 Syndicated shows rarely get any respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Case in point, "Hercules," which brought Greek mythology, scary monsters, a rare sense of humor and lots of manly posing by Kevin Sorbo to the small screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as ignored but more serious fun is "La Femme Nikita" Second Season" (Warner Bros., $99.98).</p>
