His characters are vivid, his dialogue piercing, his settingsspecific and true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet time and time again one sees aChekhov play that doesn't satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last season CSC mounted an excellent Three Sisters, the rare exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But more often one walks away unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I recently saw Zoe Wannamaker, Simon Russell Beale and an excellent cast in London fail to bring to lifeThe Cherry Orchard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much the same happens here with Dianne Wiest and John Turturro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the cast -- including Juliet Rylance and Josh Hamilton, both good -- is top-notch, one has to look at directorAndrei Belgrader for not overcoming the difficult task of making it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As often happens at Classic Stage Company, the intimate space and limited funds bring out the best in the set designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Santo Loquasto creates a circular stage with a faded white covering, stained anddirty looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huge billowy curtains contain the space until each act begins, with drapes that had been billowing out into the audience (and making it difficult to walk to your seat) lit from within to capture a poignant image and then whipped away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, these are the dramatic high points of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ranevskaya (Wiest) is returning from Paris, where she was frittering away the last remaining bit of money in her possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paralyzed by her fading fortunes and a fading way of life, she is simplyincapable of responding to the pleas of the successful businessman Lopakhin (a solid Turturro).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sonof a former slave of hers, Lopakhin has a plan to "save" Ranevskaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It involves demolishing herancestral home and chopping down her beloved cherry orchard to build weekend getaways for theburgeoning middle class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it means ending everything she's ever loved, but that will happen anywayand at least she'd have a substantial income out of it.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened GOP Candidate Compares Pregnancy From Rape To What?

(It will be nice to see Urie in How To Succeed soon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should I use a cooking metaphor or some other elaborate explanation of how tricky Chekhov is and howone must get it just right or it doesn't work at all? Discuss the difficulty of dramatizing boredom (orennui or lethargy or whatever you want to call it)? This Orchard simply doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roberta Maxwell has fun as the eccentric servant Charlotta, interacting with the audience in a casually playful manner, doing card tricks, sharing a pickle, taking someone's seat and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It works and yet it has nothing to do with the world that Chekhov has created and so ultimately it's a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something is wrong when Charlotta is what you remember best from The Cherry Orchard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wiest is certainly up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She says her goodbye to that beloved nursery, exits and then quietly returns to peek back one last time, packing more emotion into that final desperate glance than we've felt all night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what should have been the heartbreaking final moment was in fact the first realization thatsomething of import was happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER ** THEATRE AT ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLEMENT'SPeople keep tackling The Cherry Orchard because it's so hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And surely they keep tackling the hoary comedy by Moss Hart &amp; George S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaufman because it's so easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus you've got some two dozen speaking parts so everybody -- and I do mean everybody -- gets to play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No need for anyone to feel left out when mounting The Man Who Came To Dinner around the country in high schools and community theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't change the fact that it hasn't aged well in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the sort of boulevard comedy where name-dropping famous people and ritzy places is the height of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a gigantic, empty Egyptian sarcophagus appears in one scene, you can be certain someone will be bundled into it by the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim Brochu plays Sheridan Whiteside, the man of letters who slips on a front doorstep and finds himself marooned for weeks in the wasteland of Mesalia, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whiteside is rude, arrogant, insufferable andfamous, with the fame part getting him a pass from the easily cowed people of the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brochu has beenplaying Zero Mostel in the one-man show Zero Hour so he's not afraid to chew the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his Whiteside is a pussycat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After an opening scene where he mocks one and all, Whiteside proves basicallysweet, charming the servants, making nice with the children and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His only fault is in trying to stophis girl Friday Maggie Cutler (Any Landon) from falling in love with a local (Jay Stratton's Bert Jefferson)and leaving him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hijinks most definitely ensue, including a doctor who has written an imposing memoir about his career that he'd love Whiteside to read, a battle ax of a nurse suffering under Whiteside's unimaginative insults,wacky showbiz friends like Banjo (Joseph R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sicari doing his best Jimmy Durante whether you want himto or not), a bunch of convicts, a choir boy, local busybodies, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Windsor-Cunningham strikes the right foppish note as the actor Beverly Carlton but no one is particularly good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comedy is too generic and indifferent for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like other Hart &amp; Kaufmanshows (namely the tiresomely eccentric You Can't Take It With You ), this star vehicle is simply too rickety and unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It inspired a very nice set by Harry Feiner and the cast is having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately,they're having more fun than you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Bonnie &amp;
