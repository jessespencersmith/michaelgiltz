                <p>F R I D AY, S E P T E M B E R 0 8 , 2 0 0 6Variety: ABC Might Yank MiniseriesNOTE: Mediaweek says the miniseries is still scheduled to air.This story was first posted yesterday, so it's unclear how up-to-date itis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Variety did report that ABC is actively considering yanking theentire 9-11 miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many outlets, Variety is now painting thisas bloggers or partisans or Clinton officials versus ABC.But much in the same way right-wing groups mobilized to attackCBS' "The Reagans" a few years ago, Democratic partisans weredoing everything they could to discredit ABC's "The Path to9/11."Actually, no one had to do much to discredit it -- ABC took care of thatitself by making an error-riddled film it pretended was based on the9-11 Commission Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, the outcry has come from the left andthe right; it is widespread and it is consistent: ABC played fast andloose with the facts over a national tragedy that is still fresh in theminds of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why they are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Variety alsorefers to "alleged inaccuracies" when in fact they're not "alleged" at all.The inaccuracies are incontrovertible -- ABC first tried to defend themas creative license; now they are editing some of the more egregiousones out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's where they truly get it wrong:At least one Hollywood producer empathized with ABC, notingthe firestorm of criticism is the latest example of partisan groupsattempting to use their clout to bully nets and producers intoserving up noncontroversial portraits of political and socialmatters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if the Dems are right in their criticism, theproducer noted, ABC should be able to air its take."How many miniseries have there been on the Kennedys? Didanybody complain as they dragged them through the mud?" theproducer said. "Starting with 'The Reagans,' everything is nowpolitical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's become so divisive and nasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's very sad."Nice try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one is raising an uproar because they made a film about9-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People are in an uproar because ABC made a film about 9-11 thatdistorts and lies about the fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC made a film with a writer with anacknowledged right wing agenda and they knew exactly what they weredoing because they reached out ONLY to right wing bloggers andRepublicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, there have been DOZENS of documentaries,docu-dramas, fictional films, books and even comic books depictingNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Variety: ABC Might Yank Miniserieshttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/09/variety-abc-might-yank... 1 of 37/28/09 7:14 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SBiboyMichael in New YorkAaron POPSURFING.COM: Variety: ABC Might Yank Miniserieshttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/09/variety-abc-might-yank... 2 of 37/28/09 7:14 PMPOPSURFING.COM: Variety: ABC Might Yank Miniserieshttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/09/variety-abc-might-yank... 3 of 37/28/09 7:14 PM</p>
