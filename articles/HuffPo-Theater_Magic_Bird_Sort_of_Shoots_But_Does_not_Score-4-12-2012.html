Me too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show ends with the dull as dishwater Dream Team "triumph" at the Olympics that offers no tension or excitement whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actual drama of the All Star Game prior to that is similarly glossed over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many players rebelled over sharing a court with Johnson (who was elected by fans even though he'd retired) out of unreasoning fear of AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bird stood by him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We hear about this, but only in passing and Simonson doesn't begin to create conflict out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coker plays the monotone Bird to some amusing effect early on but it soon palls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniels has the easier part of the more engaging Johnson but neither man has been given more than a few moments to digdeep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that it matters, but Coker sort of handles the ball and makes a few modest shots whereasDaniels looks like he's never even seen a basketball, much less dribbled one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set design by David Korins, the sound by Nevin Steinberg and the media design by Jeff Sugg all work together nicely to present a sharp looking, clean production with all sorts of elements like old stills, game footage and the noise of crowds blended together in an unobtrusive manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there were an actual play going on, their work would be providing fine support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They did come up with a clever touch in this piece directed by Thomas Kail ( Lombardi and In The Heights ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is introduced as if they're players taking the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a cute moment at the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it turns out to be one of the few instances of originality in the entire piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
