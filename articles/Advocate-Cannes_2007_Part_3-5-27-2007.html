Death! Photo: GettyCANNES -- May 20, late eveningMy final movie for the day is Import Export, a film set in th Ukraineand Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bleak and black humored, this film follows the fallingtrajectories of two people: a young woman in the Ukraine who goesfrom nurse to sex worker to floor sweeper to live-in au pair, as well asfrom the Ukraine to Austria; and a young man who goes fromsecurity guard to petty thief to deliveryman, as well as from Austria toUkraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their paths never cross and the worlds they live in --especially the woman's hospital -- are shockingly sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has somepowerful scenes -- such as one where the nurse sings a lullaby to thebaby she had to leave at home with her mother and another whereshe mourns the death of a friendly patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there are too manydiffuse storylines that never quite gel to convince us they belongedtogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But boy, when a film ends with an elderly female patientcrying out in the middle of the night, "Stink! Death!" you know you'rein a cineaste's paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may not have been that good, but by God ittried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the bad movies inspire polite indifference to me becausenone of them are made in order to conquer the box office or appeal tothe lowest common denominator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just stat sometimes the filmsdon't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's all. -- Michael GiltzPosted at 08:37 PM in Cannes Film Festival, Film, Film Festivals,Politics | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)The Cinema Is Lies!CANNES -- May 20, eveningAfter the Golden Compass event, I rushed over to the Hilton to tryand catch the Director's Fortnight screening of Caramel, which IAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/3/ 5 of 87/22/09 4:38 PMbelieve has at least a minor subplot involving lesbianism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It screenedthis morning, but it began at the same time as XXY, which was also ofinterest to queer readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now XXY was playing at the third tier"Critics Week" event, which ranks below the Competition, Out ofCompetition, Un Certain Regard and Directors Fortnight as far asattention paid and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the producers of XXY did send out anice color brochure about the film, something most movies at thatlevel couldn't afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So clearly they were making a statement.Caramel had similar support, as well as a billboard or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both weredirected by women but because of the subject matter I knew XXYwould be dominated by a queer storyline while Caramel's ref in itsbrochure to women of various orientations was pretty vague andmight not amount to much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I chose XXY and was rewarded with aterrific film. (See below.) But I didn't want to miss Caramel either.Unfortunately the line was way too long and I was shut out. (I'mstuck with a lowly yellow badge but even a pink badge probablywould have been fruitless.)Still, the trip wasn't a waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While people with tickets were stillwalking in, a college age French woman in a sexy dress and sportingsome lovely cleavage (you realy can't avoid discussing these sorts ofthings at Cannes) walked up and down the line with two hand-madesigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In French, one said "Theater = Truth" and the other "Cinema =Lies." And she was good-naturedly screaming at the people not to goin with an endless tirade about the joys of live theater and how tinythe movies one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One heavy-set older gentleman (my God, someonemight describe me that way, though this man was older and fatterthan me) stepped toward the girl and asked her to repeat her tirade"en englais") which she did in stumbling English, but I think he justwanted to stare at her cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was great fun, even spitting --SPITTING -- on the ground at the mere mention of film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotta loveCannes. -- Michael GiltzPosted at 08:29 PM in Cannes Film Festival, Film, Film Festivals |Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)"The Golden Compass" ScreeningFinally, one of my most anticipated events of the festival arrives: thescreening of footage from the holiday release The Golden Compass.This film is based on the first book in a trilogy by Philip Pullman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theover-arching title is His Dark Materials, it's a reworking of Milton'sParadise Lost, and the series (completed only in 2000) has alreadysold 14 million copies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will take its placealongside The Lord of th Rings and the Narnia books as a landmarkof fantasy. (Pullman has no patience for them.) It's also extremelyprovocative in tackling organized religion and reclaiming sex assomething beautiful and good, especially when you get to the thirdbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the first book is deceptively simple and straightforwardand overall you are drawn in by the imagination, the wonder and theAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/3/ 6 of 87/22/09 4:38 PMmarvelous characters.Pullman is a big fan of storytelling, something he thinks has been lostin mainstream fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As you can gather, I'm a big fan of the books.I've written about them a number of times and interviewed Pullmanon the phone and at his former home in Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I was probablymore prepared than anyone else in that room and I found the footage-- basically a ten minute trailer -- very promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone seems toembody their characters, especially Nicole Kidman as Marisa Coulter(Pullman always had her in mind if a film were to be made) and thenewcomer Dakota Blue as Lyra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She must carry the film and this 12year old girl looks capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sweep was exciting, the armoredbear (a central character) wholly convincing, the witch (Eva Green)compelling-- really I had nothing to complain about.I am looking forward to this film very, very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since TheGolden Compass doesn't venture into heretical territory (believe me,parts two and three do), they can be very faithful to the books withoutoffending anyone. (And by anyone, I mean the vast majority ofpeople, not the fringe folk who condemn Harry Potter and TheWizard of Oz and anything else they disapprove of.) Good fun,though I wish they'd given us a scene to sink our teeth into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead itreally was along trailer of highlights that probably made more senseto me than most others.Posted at 08:18 PM in Books, Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film,Film Festivals, Religion, Sex | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack(0)Bill Maher Takes On GodOne of the most intriguing projects that surfaced at Cannes isuntitled Larry Charles Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles of course was a major force onSeinfeld and directed the Sacha Baron Cohen smash hit Borat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hisnew film tackles God and may make Borat look like a Valentine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyscreened 10 minutes of footage for the film, which is narrated byardent anti-organized religion comic Bill Maher, who loves skeweringfaith on his show Real Time With Bill Maher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Borat, it blendscomedy and docu-style footage, though it's unclear whether the twoare blurred as they are in Borat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any case, it's been sold in manycountries (though not the US) but the names of the buyers have beenkept secret because of it's controversial nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sounds likeChristopher Hitchens has already found his favorite film of 2008. --Michael GiltzPosted at 07:55 PM in Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film, FilmFestivals, Politics, Religion, Television | Permalink | Comments (0) |TrackBack (0)Privacy Policy | User Agreement | Community Guidelines | LegalNoticeAdvocate.com ¬© 2008 Regent Entertainment Media Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All RightsAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/3/ 7 of 87/22/09 4:38 PMReserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/3/ 8 of 87/22/09 4:38 PM</p>
