Is it a (gentle) primer on punctuation and grammar? Is it funny? Yes, yes and yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary Norris is the"Comma Queen" who worked her way up the ladder at The New Yorker, the last bastion of clear and correct writing.Her delightfully shaggy new book does many things well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It offers a glimpse into the fabled world of The New Yorker.It tells of her trials by fire -- tentatively suggesting a correction here, wrangling with writers there, receiving words ofpraise from this famed talent while getting nowhere with that famed talent who stubbornly clings to a certain wordingbecause it feels right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Philip Roth, Pauline Kael and the vivid New Yorker figure of Eleanor Gould are all here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthis isn't a straightforward memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The girl can't help herself: Norris playfully dives into various burning issues, suchas whether the sentence "Yes, yes and yes" should have a comma after that second "yes," when to say "Betweenyou &amp; I" (pretty much never) and the purpose of that thingie that looks like an umlaut but isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn't diagram asentence to save my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never even heard of a copulative verb and blush to think what it might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YetNorris makes it all fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's devilishly good at serving up examples of what she's talking about in the very sentencesshe uses to describe something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it ends with an ode to the No. 1 pencil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's not to love? Between you and I,I'd be worried about my grammar if I ever spoke to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I shouldn't be: she's no scold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Comma Queen makesproper punctuation a pleasure. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“[Between You &amp; Me] brims with wit, personality — and commas… Norris' enthusiasm is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's aspassionate about sharp pencils as she is about sharp writing… Delightful.” - Heller McAlpin NPR Books“[A] winningly tender, funny reckoning with labor and language.” - Megan O'Grady Vogue“Delightful.” - Miriam Krule Slate“Very funny, lucid, and lively.” - Julia Holmes The New Republic“Laugh-out-loud funny and wise and compelling from beginning to end.” - Steve Weinberg Houston Chronicle“Down-to-earth… [and] funny.” - Linda Lowenthal Boston Globe“An educational, entertaining narrative… Unforgettable anecdotes… Countless laugh-out-loud passages… A funnybook for any serious reader.” - Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review“A delightful discourse on the most common grammar, punctuation, and usage challenges faced by writers of allstripes… Norris writes with wit, sass, and smarts.” - Publishers Weekly“Thoughtful and humorous… [Between You &amp; Me] is not your grade school primer; expect wisecracks and pointedcommentary.” - Gricel ​Dominguez Library Journal“[A]…</p>
