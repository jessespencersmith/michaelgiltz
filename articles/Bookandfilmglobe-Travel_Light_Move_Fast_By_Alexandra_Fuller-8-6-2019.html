                <p>Tuesday, August 6, 2019 Memoir NON-FICTION Traveling Heavy Alexandra Fuller Explores Family In New Memoir  August 5, 2019 Michael Giltz What can would-be writers born into boring, happy families do? Write poetry, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, author Alexandra Fuller will never have to buy a rhyming dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller burst onto the international scene in 2001 with her debut memoir, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let‚Äôs Go To The Dogs Tonight.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rambunctious, hilarious, perceptive and unflinching look at a childhood growing up in strife-torn Alexandra Fuller, 2014 Photograph: Greg MarinovichRhodesia (now Zimbabwe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, Bobo‚Äìas Fuller‚Äôs family calls her‚Äìwatches her white parents struggle to hold onto their land during a brutal war that rightly ends with the collapse of that fading colonial dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read it and you‚Äôll discover a greatamount of drinking, story-telling and wickedly pointed commentary by one and all, along with glimpses of racialcondescension and comity gleefully mixed together as only a colonialist can do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs a furiously funny combination of ‚ÄúOut Of Africa‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatch-22‚Äù and how the heck would she ever top it? Well, you don‚Äôt, but you do soldier on and eventually deliver more good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In various works of nonfiction,Fuller told the tale of a white African soldier in Zambia, an oil-rig worker in her new home of Wyoming andeven the disintegration of her own marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None had the vital pulse of family. (Yes, one was about her ex- husband and sure she married him, but he wasn‚Äôt blood .) Yes, yes, I kept thinking when reading them, but what about your family? Whatcountry have your parents landed in and how are they getting on?Finally Fuller relented and did an entire book devoted to her mother. ‚ÄúCocktail Hour Under The Tree Of Forgetfulness‚Äù (see, even the title is as good as her first) proved a rich, wholly satisfying look at the lifeof Nicola Fuller, a more acerbic Isak Dinesen, always surrounded by arambunctious collection of dogs, birds and other animals. (Nicola talksto them all, including dangerous snakes in the yard, wholly convincedthey understand and listen to her.) Then Fuller freed herself once and for all from the burden of family with her first novel, proving she can deliver the goods out of wholecloth. ‚Äú Quiet Until The Thaw ‚Äù covers decades in the life of two cousins in the Lakota Oglala Sioux Nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like her best memoirs it‚Äôs raw, unvarnished and gives her NativeAmerican characters the dignity of being flawed, imperfect and messily alive human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, few noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite some very good reviews, I think critics were too afraid to recognize a white woman born in England and raised in Zimbabwe had the ability or even the right to create a work of fictionabout indigenous Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs nonsense, of course, but there you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the bright side, Fuller‚Äôs returned to her family again and devoted a book to the death and life of her father, Tim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins with him dying in Budapest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether Fuller is trying to negotiate with the implacable hospitaladministration or arranging to take her dad‚Äôs cremated remains home with them, the stories are blacklyhumorous yet again.The black sheep of his family, Tim spent his life unburdening himself of constraints and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Fuller‚Äôs mind, he is always off to the local pub for a drink or taking his nightly constitutional (invariably including afutile pot-shot or two at looming beasties).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim promises to tell Fuller the secret to life‚Ä¶and then promptlyforgets what he was saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never fear, the book is peppered with rallying cries and useful tidbits like ‚ÄúTravellight, move fast.‚Äù The novel jumps back and forth with the through-line of Tim‚Äôs death, somewhat successful cremation and a memorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This final journey of Tim‚Äôs is punctuated by bits from his childhood, marriage and any odd storyFuller hasn‚Äôt offered up before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she repeated some, I didn‚Äôt notice and certainly didn‚Äôt care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While nominally about her father, Fuller‚Äôs sister, other vivid people in their lives and especially her mother cannot be kept offstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Budapest, her mother Nicola finds a garden swarming with stray cats, names themall, feeds them every day, befriends the gardener and thrusts money in his hand for their care when leaving, wellaware he‚Äôll likely take the loot and be off to the nearest bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller tucks Nicola sweetly and sadly into bed after her husband‚Äôs death, packed and ready to head to the airport before dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller shows us the roles of parent and child reversed as they eventually are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hours later,Fuller finds her mother surrounded by three empty wine bottles and in no mood to get out of bed much lesshead to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contents of every suitcase are strewn about the room.‚Üê ‚ÄòEvvie Drake Starts Over‚Äô In a World Where No One Speaks Jive ‚ÜíWhen a cab is called anyway, Nicola somehow but quite naturally knows the cabbie by name and embraces him as an old and dear friend, leaving Fuller on the outside yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the airport, it‚Äôs Nicola‚Äôs imperious, imperturbable sense of superiority that gets her carted onto the plane in a wheelchair, not Fuller‚Äôs politefulminations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim would surely have preferred to die in the Africa he loved so fiercely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Budapest certainly offers the right send-off for this eternally displaced family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller writes about one of his last clear moments when dying farfrom home. ‚Äú‚ÄôDid I do this to get into one of your Awful Books,‚Äô Dad had asked from his deathbed‚Ä¶; lucidly present in the world I recognized for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd laughed then. ‚ÄòProbably.‚Äô‚ÄúDad had chuckled too. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôll annoy Mum.‚Äô‚ÄúAnother Awful Book, how many more can be written?‚ÄùAt least two, I‚Äôd say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have faith Fuller will deliver more works of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I‚Äôm just as convinced she will pen a memoir focusing on the tangled, difficult relationship with her sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the moment, they‚Äôre not speakingto one another, so what‚Äôs to lose? And then there are Fuller‚Äôs children‚Ä¶..
