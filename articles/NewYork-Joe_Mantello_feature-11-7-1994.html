                <p>.UplCl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ta e t Ights! Canlera! Actor! As an actor, Joe Mantello has never been more visible, winning a Tony nomination for his role as the argumen­ tative louis in Angels in America_ But it's Mantello the director who's center stage now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's directing Faith Prince on Broadway in What's Wrong With This Picture? And when Jerry Zaks stepped away from Love! Valour! Compassion!-the new Terrence McNally play at the Manhattan Theatre Club--Mantel- 10 took on that as well ... despite one week during which he was rehearsing both plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though L!V!C! was written by McNally and Mantello uHimately landed talent like Nathan lane, John Glover, and Stephen Spinella, casting was tough_ "H's very hard," says Mantello, "to cast plays right now; particularly when you try to cast men in their late thirties and forties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The casting director would hand us a list of people's names that would say 'not interested,' 'not available,' 'doesn't want to play gay.' H really is like calling in favors to get people." Early on, Man­ tello also had reserva­ tions about the audience at the MTC. "They were described to me as 'withholding,' as a group that refused to give Julie Andrews entrance applause. (But) the response has been great; I'm shocked Malltello alld the "L.'V!C'" cast. at how well it's going over." Broadway, of course, provides other shock waves. un I actually stopped to think how much money was being sunk into [What's Wrongj, I would be unable to go to work," Mantello admits. "So I'll just blindly continue on and pretend I'm doing a little showcase on 47th Street." MICHAEl GILTZ</p>
