In the fifth Leonid McGill novel, Leonid finds himself in anunusual pickle of trying to balance his cases with his chaoticpersonal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leonid's father is still out there somewhere, and hiswife is in an uptown sanitarium trying to recover from the deepdepression that led to her attempted suicide in the previous novel.His wife's condition has put a damper on his affair with AuraUllman, his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And his son, Twill, has been spending a lotof timeâ€¦Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This Book Go to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site whereyou can get this book.BookFilter12/1/2015BookFilter | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=8671188f-ad8c-4398-bfd5-a2087cb23008&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/2 Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayI'm a selfish man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wanted more stories about Easy Rawlins and detective Leonid McGill -- the character authorWalter Mosley seemed to be offering in his place -- just would not do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that Rawlins is back, I can approachMcGill with a light heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This noir-ish hero is a criminal gone good, a short man with a tall shadow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Rawlins andindeed like a lot of pulp detectives, McGill seems to attract dangerous and beautiful women with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also likeRawlins, his life is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives and works in New York City and McGill's extended family -- covering biology,emotion and need -- is wide-ranging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his fifth novel, McGill is juggling a LOT of balls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Varied plots include a Fagin-like underworld figure with literally hundreds of orphaned children at his command, a rich and powerful woman with apoisonous secret she'll kill to protect, a Che Guevera-like father back from the shadows, a wife in name only who hasattempted suicide, and a seductive damsel in distress who just might be McGill's soul mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which is a depressingthought, since she has no soul, implying McGill misplaced his somewhere along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like I said, a LOT of ballsin the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mosley is having a lot of fun here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, McGill is so prone to insights they begin to blur; shove a gun in hisback and he'll philosophize, offer a bribe and he'll go off on a mental tangent about money and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few lessaphorisms and they might have more weight to them because pound for pound they're as solid as this one-timeboxer turned knight errant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGill's contemporary stories don't have the weight of history behind them the wayMosley's do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a way, they don't even have the presence of New York City as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then, neither does New YorkCity any more, hollowed out as it is by Russian oligarchs, Aran sheiks and a Duane Reade on every corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGillfortunately provides his own personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans will dive in and newcomers will enjoy catching up. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
