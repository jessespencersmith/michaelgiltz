Who wouldn't be? Act one showing a brash 1 percenter looking tododge taxes and maybe get out of dodge with a pretty young wife whilehe still can seemed pretty awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But act two made act one seem positively pleasant in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set, the costumes, the sound design -- literally everything seems off key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's hardly worth hashing over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Co-star Christopher Denham has a secondary role that's blandly anonymous and then inevitably takes aturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not the turn one expected, but not a good turn, just hard to believeand uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ending is a shocker only in the sense that you can hardly tell how anyone expects it to play -- seriously, jokingly, tragically, blackly? I've no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all a little sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One hates to see great artists slog their way through inferior material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I marvel at actors who have to go out on stage anddo it all again the next night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It must be a particular circle of hell to bestuck in a show you know isn't going to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oddly, I can't wait for them to tackle something else because a legendary partnership like theirs should not end on a note like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCHOOL OF ROCK * 1/2 out of **** but *** out of **** on cute scale WINTER GARDEN THEATRE It's a bland xerox of the movie -- right down to the creepily specific casting of child actors who by and large fit the ethnic roles of their movie counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lead actor is doing Jack Black redux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The classic rocksongs (all stolen by Rock Of Ages, apparently) are replaced by blandBroadway songs posing as rock tunes thanks to the occasional electric guitar or drum solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if I could invest in it, I would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber hasn't had a hit in the US or UK in at least 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whistle Down The Wind in 1996 was his last triumph in the WestEnd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunset Blvd. was his last hit (of a sort) in the US, though if you wantto talk profitability, one has to go back 30 years to Phantom Of The Opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man who once dominated the boards like no one ever had before or since has faced a long, long drought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That drought is over with School Of Rock, a critic-proof musical that apparently doesn't need to be critic-proof. (Others seemed to be kind to it, though I've only heard this second-hand.) It will probably make money on Broadway and on tour and in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's really going to clean up in school and community productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the show, the parents watch their kids rocking out at the finale with unabashed joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine the sametaking place in town after town and you'll realize the power of thisshowcase for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've seen the movie, you've seen the show, right down to the strong casting of cute as a button kids jamming out on bass, guitar, drums,keyboards and vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very, very little is different, though a song and scene or two clarifies how the kids have parents too consumed with work to pay them much attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter Dewey Finn, a struggling musician whoposes as a substitute teacher at a snooty private school, turns his classof misfits into rock gods and enters the local battle of the bands so they can bond with their parents and put glitter in their hair at the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lessons will be learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big change is the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foolproof fun of seeing talented kids jamout on classics (It's cute! I'll admit it.) is replaced by a clutch of originals with music by Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Glenn Slater, whose best work is on Disney's Tangled .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are vaguely peppy and rock-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, Lloyd Webber began by bringing rock to Broadway with Jesus Christ Superstar,but he's always been a traditionalist at heart. (It's no wonder his best work harkens back to classical music.) His music may be plugged in but it's resolutely old-fashioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first act boasts two fun production numbers. "You're In The Band" is the show's early highlight (and presumably the one they'll do on the Tony's unless they've lost their minds.) The amiable Alex Brightman encourages his charges to loosen up and jam out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As each onestruts their stuff, he proclaims "You're in the band!" and the fun buildsand builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've also got a faux protest song called "Stick It To The Man" for another relative barn burner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The songs aren't actually good (Lloyd Webber is usually good for at least one killer melody a show; not here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, act two grinds to a halt, with multiple stops for fake confrontations, the tiresome cliche of a bitchy girlfriend who must be upbraided by her mousey man and hugs all around at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worst of all, Sierra Boggess is the uptight principal of the school that the kidsattend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a secret fan of Stevie Nicks but (inexplicably) also wandersthe halls belting out opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She and Dewey go on a date, a snatch of the Nicks' classic "Edge Of Seventeen" gets the juices flowing...and then Boggess must warble her way through "Where Did The Rock Go?," theblandest, least rockin' ode to rock and roll in the history of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be laughable -- a schmaltzy Broadway ballad bemoaning the disappearance of "real" rock and roll, if you didn't ache so for Boggess.It's practically her only number, other than a bizarre curtain call reprise ofsome Mozart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The blandness of act two isn't worth covering, but one crucial example sticks out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shy Tomika (Bobbi MacKenzie) rarely speaks and can'tsay what she wants to do in this class project. (Others are musicians or back-up singers or stylists or roadies and so on.) Our hero asks her what she wants to be but this mute, mostly sad looking child doesn't knowwhat to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He says, well let me know and literally forgets about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It isn't until act two that she finally speaks up (through no prompting of his) and says she wants to sing and does. (To prove it, she sings "AmazingGrace," another bizarre musical choice only defended by being in thepublic domain and thus cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, it makes no sense in a show embracing rock and roll.) At the end Tomika tells her gay dads (it's that kind of show) that her teacher inspired and encouraged her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uh, no hedidn't! Would it have killed the show to have Dewey reach out sweetlyseveral times to Tomika, trying to draw her out of her shell and showing his own growth as a person? It's an obvious lapse in the by the numbers book by Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience doesn't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The production is ugly, the musical choicesbland, the originals anonymous, and most every element just cribs from the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the kids lock into a song and show their pizazz and the crowd eats it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hell, if I had kids (and I'd already taken them to Matildaand Aladdin and The Lion King), I'd take them to this harmless show aswell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on the ride home we'd blast Led Zeppelin and The Ramones and JImi Hendrix, not the score to School Of Rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK ANIMALS ** 1/2 out of **** NEW OHIO THEATRE Bedlam is one of the best theater troupes in New York City right now, smartly inventive and bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait for the return of their marvelous adaptation of Sense And Sensibility in January, a charmer that deserves to transfer to Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up first is this foray into a musical or to be exact a string of sketches interspersed by songs. it's more of a song cycle than a full blown show.The New Ohio Theater has been turned into a cabaret and the live band on stage is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of sketches painting the lonely, desperate lives of New Yorkers follow, brought to life by the five member cast(augmented by a band member once or twice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the usual array: aworld weary waitress, a kook that her "friends" both humor and try to avoid, the lovelorn, married couples fraying at the edge and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between the sketches, songs are sung by the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Sater of Spring Awakening is the playwright and lyricist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is strong and each of them has a particular moment -- or numerous moments -- where they shine andbring these broken people to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, the sketches overlap: characters slowly reveal connections to one another and many of them converge at a hospital emergency room at the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they don't build, somehow, onone another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever invisible thread is needed to unite them is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some sketches are stronger than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But once you feel the inherent randomness at play here (there could have been five sketches or 15 or50), they become somehow a little exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without sensing an over-arching structure (however unspoken), our confidence in where the play is going is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not speaking of an Atlman-esque community of folk (in fact, this show attempts just that) but something subtler and moreessential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know what it is, but it's not here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the sketches work okay on their own terms thanks to the excellentcast directed by fellow performer Eric Tucker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the songs! Sater collaborated with the great Burt Bacharach, who has enjoyed a creative renaissance in recent years by collaborating with the likes of ElvisCostello and Ronald Isley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hits the jackpot again with Sater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their songs feature the distinctive, sophisticated arrangements that made Bacharach famous and lyrics among Sater's best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they're put across with aplomb by the band, led by pianist and singer Debra Barsha and lead singer Jo Lampert, who has great presence and great chops (and great earrings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no small compliment to say they make these songs sound easy, since Bacharach's tunes rarely are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthey're gems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to see Lampert in concert, soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to hear thesongs again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would have purchased a CD with the tunes before leaving the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this had been a 45 minute cabaret act introducing this as a song cycle, it would have been a triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it is, you're reminded of the many talented members of Bedlam even in less than ideal settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But mostly you just want to sit back and listen to another song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE NEW STANDARDS HOLIDAY SHOW *** out of **** DAVID RUBENSTEIN ATRIUM AT LINCOLN CENTER Whew! Just when I felt like a grinch, along come The New Standards to put me in a buoyant mood! This Minneapolis super group is composed of members from beloved indie bands like The Suburbs and Trip Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their reason for being is establishing the new rockstandards, celebrating the tunes from pop music that deserve being covered again and again as much as the greats of Tin Pan Alley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically, they do so with their swinging trio of piano (Chan Poling), bass(John Munson) and vibraphone (the geekily sexy Steve Roehm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can check out their new album right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've also got an annual tradition of doing holiday shows where the band is augmented with horns and guitar players and backup singers anda passel of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all goofy fun, with a slightly left of centersensibility giving a wickedly fun but sincere spin to holiday classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For their third holiday show in New York City, the band returned to the David Rubenstein Atrium Of Lincoln Center, a public space filled with freeconcerts throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a slightly bright sound that is lessthan ideal, but it hardly matters with this crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience arrived early to secure seats and were clearly returnees bringing along friends to convert them to the new standards of The New Standards.They began with New Order but soon plunged into various and sundry tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fare ranged from "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" to "I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm." The vibe was very 1950s TV special (the excellent vibes of Roehm helped), though more traditionaltunes also popped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fred Schneider of The B-52s barked out new lyricsto "The 12 Days Of Christmas" in a typically goofy number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian Fleischer was the perfect guest, swinging his way through numerous standards and bantering with ease. (By his third or fourth number,Fleischer's vocals were truly impressive.) Chris Koza (a musician worth checking out in his own right) multi-tasked by playing guitar, delivering backing vocals, competing with Roehm inlow-key charm, and then stepping forward with one of the night's bestnumbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sang "Walking In The Air," from the British TV special TheSnowman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That Oscar-nominated film is a beloved animation classic in the UK, played every holiday and akin to its place in popular culture to ACharlie Brown Christmas here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, the song is schmaltzy in the original and when they mentioned this was the song Koza would tackle Iwas wary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his arrangement and vocals won me over and convinced there was a genuinely good song hiding under that children's choir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who knew? But as she always does, the marvelous Nellie McKay stole the show. (Always polite, she handed it right back.) McKay came out in a Dietrich- like tuxedo and sang a tune in a thick German accent, puzzling but delighting the uninitiated and thrilling her fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New lyrics also addedspice when it became a medley. (I think.) She returned later with greenface paint and dressed as a marijuana plant to rap to her song about wanting weed for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As she chirped delightfully about the fact that a huge portion of prisoners in the US are in there for non-violent,marijuana related offenses -- and made it swing! -- all you could do was smile and declare your love.
