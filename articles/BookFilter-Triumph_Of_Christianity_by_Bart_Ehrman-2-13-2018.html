(Obviously, if God wants your religion to succeed, well by God it's GOING to succeed.) He focuses on the practical real world questions raised by the amazing success of a faith which began with about twenty poor people in a rural community at the time of Christ's death.Ehrman is best at putting Christianity in context, lucidly explaining that antipathy towards Christians wasn't knee-jerkShare This Book About The Author Bart D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ehrman Bart D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ehrman is the author or editor of more than thirty books, including the New York Times bestsellers Misquoting Jesus and How Jesus Became God .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ehrman is a professor of religious studies at theUniversity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and a leading authority on the New Testament and the history of early Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hasbeen featured in Time , The New Yorker , and The Washington Post , and has appeared on NBC, CNN, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, The History Channel, NationalGeographic, BBC, major NPR shows, andother top print and broadcast media outlets.His most recent book is The Triumph ofChristianity .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: February 13, 2018 Publisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Pages: 352 ISBN 10: 1501136704 ISBN 13: 9781501136702prejudice but inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a world where virtually everyone believed that if the gods weren't properly honored that disaster would strike in the form of war or famine or disease or natural disaster and the like, a new religion that insisted all the other gods simply didn't exist or were demons wasn't just "different" but a genuine threat to everyone's existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How did it grow so quickly? Looking carefully at the best available data shows it was not so spectacular but rather anexample of recruitment at a reasonable but exponentially big amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the appeal of Christianity? Ehrman suggests itsunique desire to proselytize and ground-breaking promise of a blissful life after death combined to make it a giant killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orin this case, a god(s)-killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ehrman runs out of steam towards the end and this is truly a work of scholarship rather than a compelling story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for those with an interest, it is clearly laid out and useful for placing a new faith squarely in its time and place. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Drawing on a wealth of ancient sources and contemporary historical research, Bart Ehrman weaves complex questions into a vivid, nuanced, and enormously readable narrative.” - Elaine Pagels, National Book Award- winning author of The Gnostic Gospels “One of Christian history’s greatest puzzles after the age of the apostles is how a tiny band of mostly-illiterate outsiders converted the proud and massive Roman Empire in just three centuries – a historical blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In The Triumph of Christianity , Ehrman brings impressive research, intellectual rigor, and an instinct for storytelling to this extraordinary dynamic.” - David Van Biema, former religion writer at Time and author of the forthcoming Speaking to God What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
