It would take the weight off astory that really doesn't have issues of faith on its mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That wouldn't make this familiar story ofsmall-town corruption and small-time power-grabbing more original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it would lower thepretension level that such a title raises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Variety's Sam Thielman said: "Noone's yarn gets better and better as it rockets along, especially with Campbell Scott to give the title character a well-placed jolt or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Augustine Early, a newspaper reporter swallowed whole by ambition, Scott has enough hypnotic charisma for aboutfive actors, keeping the aud enthralled by Early's smooth-voiced, friendly facade and occasionallyletting his barely controlled rage smash it to bits." The Associated Press' Michael Kuchwara said: "Noone's writing has a rhythmic quality, call it a staccato lilt, that Scott captures with complete assurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nattily dressed in a light suit and tie, the actor resembles a fast-talking salesman, sort of a darker, nastier version of Professor Harold Hill of"Music Man" fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And director Justin Waldman never lets the pace of the evening slacken,despite the play's two acts." Theatremania's Barbara &amp; Scott Siegel said: "If you see a better performance on a stage in New York City this year, it will have to surpass the extraordinary work by Campbell Scott in the one- person play The Atheist, a co-production of the Culture Project and Circle in the Square, now at the Barrow Street Theatre." A BODY OF WATERUnlike Campbell Scott, Christine Lahti is not alone up there in Lee Blessing's A Body Of Water at Primary Stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's one of three actors, but I'm really referring to the technical aspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set is an hypnotic one, with a living room bordered on two sides by visions of a green countryside thatare 3-D in their inviting beauty and a backdrop of a marvelous view of more greenery and thewater (a lake? a river?) of the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with the lighting and sound, it's all elegant and simpleand vaguely mysterious, just like the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A description of the play sounds Brechtian or Pinter-esque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two adults (Christine Lahti and Michael Christofer) wake up in a home with a wonderful view, seemingly cut off from the world.And they have no idea who either of them are (are they married? friends? siblings?) or what'sgoing on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A young woman later appear (Laura Odeh) who provides them with a string of answers,seemingly whatever fits her mood or perhaps just what might appeal to the two people and keepthem calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, the show is not nearly so abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two people are probably married and either they lost a daughter in a terrible crime or maybe the young woman is their daughter and maybe the wifetried to kill the husband for cheating on her emotionally (she may or may not have found a diary in "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

What brought them to this point in their lives? Is joy meaningless or more real if we acknowledge how alone and yet interconnected we are? It's a credit to Blessing's play that we feel genuinely engaged with such abstract ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a modest, intriguing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think on a Broadway stage it would feel too blown up, too important and the weighty metaphysical ideas that are quietly present now would take over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it is, in the intimate space of Primary Stages, the show has its ideal setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Odeh as the young woman is a bit mannered, but that works just fine for a character that may be a daughter forced to reenact the same wrenching details over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a bit worried about Christofer, who is better known to me as a playwright ( The Shadow Box) and film writer and director ( Gia, The Thomas Crown Affair ) than as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he is very good as Moss, the disheveled man who is invariably attracted to this compelling, beautiful, funny woman he'sstranded with on an island of no memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And who can blame him? Lahti is effortless as Avis, a sexy, confident woman confronting the frightening circumstance she's found herself in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early on, she and Moss are alone, trying to figureout if they know each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He suggests they open their robes and look at each other's body --maybe a birthmark or some such intimate detail will trigger something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avis amiably distrusts him,but she's no prude and soon agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moss opens his robe and she takes some tongs from thekitchen to move around his privates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a moment, she says thoughtfully, "Just like apenis...only smaller" before he jumps away in annoyance and the audience laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The line isnothing special, but Lahti is so present in the moment, laughing so easily and without malice at herlittle joke that you can't help being won over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whoever they may be, he's lucky to be trapped withher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later, Lahti looks so terrific in a blue dress that you can't help feeling a little cheated inretrospect when she flashed him but kept her back to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In every other respect, Lahti exposesherself fully with the talent and charm we've come to expect from the actor behind movies likeSwing Shift, Housekeeping, Running On Empty and the late, lamented TV drama Jack and Bobby.Look at her credits and you can't help feeling she hasn't been given her due nearly enough in anymedium -- not in the movies, on TV or onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her character might forget herself, but we won'tforget her - Lahti is too good for that to ever happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others have said: The New York Times' Charles Isherwood said: "This sputtering drama about a man and a woman who wake up one day with matching cases of amnesia is ultimately so, er, forgettable that its resolution ceases to be a matter of suspense long before it arrives....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lahti gives a warm performance (she looks sensational too) and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cristofer an energetic one, but their charactersnever move beyond fussing over the oddity of their predicament to reveal distinct personalities." The Daily News' Joe Dziemianowicz said: three stars out of five. "Staged by Maria Mileaf for Primary Stages, the production boasts a smooth flow, consistent tone and handsome design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rainstorm seems so real you'll want to open an umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lahti, onstage after a 15-year gap, andCristofer ("The Shadow Box") bring out the couple's confusion and wariness and are quite movingas they reach out to each other." Variety's Sam Thielman said: "Blessing's script is unlikely to ruffle any feathers, but the central insights about intimacy are sneakily disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The couple's rude awakening is an everyday occurrence (maybe), followed by an exploration of the Edenic world around them (possibly) thatvanishes into the haze of forgetfulness as soon as they go to bed together in the evening, again forthe first time (perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is the love that blossoms every day between Moss and Avis (convincinglyplayed, especially by Lahti) the real thing, or is it simply better living through that initialchemistry?" Theatermania's David Finkle said: "The Edenic view is represented by three huge and captivating Timothy Arzt paintings -- one upstage, one stage left, one stage right -- that look like something Henri Rousseau might have rendered as the 20th Century got underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You look at it and wish Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Cars War Wire Video Financial Crisis Barack Obama MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...
