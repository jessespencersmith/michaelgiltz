( Check out my ratings for all the movies from 1939 right here .) Perhaps only in a year filled with movies like Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith Goes To Washington, Stagecoach, Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, the larkier but somewhat similar Gunga Dun, Ninotchka, of course Gone With The Wind and so many others could The Four Feathers be relatively overshadowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It received only one Oscar nomination (for its spectacular color cinematography -- losing naturally to GWTW ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while cineastes consider it a classic, it's slipped from view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I find the film rather stiff. (And the recent remake did its reputation no good -- though my friend Pete insists the 3+ hour cut he saw at a screening of that 2002 film was terrific.) But if anyone can save its fading rep it's Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This BluRay has a gorgeous transfer and has some solid extras, most notably a briefmaking-of filmed on location and a new interview with Korda's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PULP FICTION BLURAY ($19.99; Lionsgate/Miramax)MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

The Muppets Take Manhattan has a slight edge because it was directed by Frank Oz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither film is as good as the original Muppet Movie and while they're never quite as great as I hope, they'reconsistently silly fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combine Manhattan's story with the first film's journey and you've got yourself atwo act Broadway musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Volunteering Weird News Terrorism Buy a link here Sponsored Links 57-Year-Old Mom Looks 25 Mom Reveals Free Wrinkle Trick That Has Angered Doctors!

CINEMA PARADISO BLURAY ($14.99; Lionsgate/Miramax) SOAP DISH BLURAY (; Paramount) -- Every movie ever made is fated to become a Broadway musical (and yes, I include Schindler's List , though God willing at least that might be an opera).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol has been musicalized endlessly, though the most enduring is probably Scrooge with Albert Finney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It won't keep me away from the Alastair Sim drama from 1951 that is the gold standard, but it's a nice change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Willy Wonka story has been musicalized numerous times but has nevermade it to Broadway...yet. it was scheduled for London this holiday but the show's creative team was sidetracked by their unappreciated gem Catch Me If You Can, which closed on Broadway too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's coming and can't possibly be worse than Tim Burton's train wreck, with Johnny Depp's most mannered performance to date the one oddball saving grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cinema Paradiso seems an even moreunlikely source for a musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It stars an elderly man and a little boy and the climax involves old movie footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's one of the many Miramax films they're eying to exploit in the theater. i've always found the movie sentimental in the extreme, but audiences do love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, there's Soap Dish, the sillycomedy about backstapping on a soap opera with a very game cast that includes Sally Field, Kevin Kline,Robert Downey Jr. and Whoopi Goldberg -- you know what, they could all repeat their roles onstage! If I were gonna make a musical comedy set in the world of soap operas, I'd make Tootsie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't be surprised to hear...they're working on that one, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serena Williams Video Holidays TV Latino Politics Zimbabwe MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE ($39.95 BluRay or $29.95 DVD; Criterion) -- Speaking of A Christmas Carol, this Swedish silent classic has a similar plot -- in it, a nasty drunk (played by the director of the film, Victor Sjostrom) is given a chance to see the error of his ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legend has it that the last person to die on New Year's Eve must take the reins of Death's vehicle and collect souls for a year, a good chance toreassess how you've lived your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a lot more work than one night of frights before Christmas but just as effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film was a major influence on Ingmar Bergman, who is featured in the extras, along with two scores (one traditional, one modern) and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CIDER HOUSE RULES BLURAY ($14.99; Lionsgate/Miramax) -- This Lasse Hallstrom film is based on John Irving's best novel. it contains one of Tobey Maguire's best performances and won Michael Caine the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a lot of "bests" for a movie that received seven Academy Award nominations (and two wins) and yet seems to have fallen off the radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps it's because themovie deals with abortion and a woman's right to choose? Still, it deserves to be remembered more fondly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jimi Hendrix Named Greatest Guitarist Of All...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Wagner: Murder Suspect On 'NCIS' Daniel Radcliffe Almost Wasn't Harry Potter 'Community': Beetlejuice Secret Easter Egg In Halloween...THE MA &amp; PA KETTLE COMPLETE COMEDY COLLECTION ($19.98; Universal) -- This set contains all ten films featuring Ma &amp; Pa Kettle, who were the breakout supporting characters on the mild comedy The Egg And I (the first film in this set).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whoever said, "Give those two their own movie!" struck gold as the cornpone couple appeared in low-budget hit after hit, thanks in no small part to Marjorie Main's excellent skill on even this tired material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten films is about seven or eight too much, but when the entire set costs just $20, who's complaining?
