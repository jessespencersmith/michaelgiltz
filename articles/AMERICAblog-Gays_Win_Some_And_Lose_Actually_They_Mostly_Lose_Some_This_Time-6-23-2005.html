                <p>T H U R S D A Y , J U N E 2 3 , 2 0 0 5Gays Win Some And Lose...Actually, TheyMostly Lose Some This Timeby Michael in New York on 6/23/2005 09:36:00 AMThe Times of London reports that the Anglican Church is closerthan ever to a genuine schism over the North American wings'decisions to ordain gay people as bishops and encourage othersto lead devout, monogamous lives. (How unChristian of them!)The US and Canada churches are effectively expulsed until2008, for what amounts to an Anglican timeout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then theyhave to renounce their wicked ways of treating gays withdignity and respect or there will be hell to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, theonly acceptable gay people to most of the church around theworld are eunuchs and most of the people complaining stillhaven't recovered from seeing women treated as equal to menand capable of leading a flock.The US Church, as made clear in its Tuesdaypresentation, has been developing its theology infavour of ordinations of homosexuals for 40 yearsand regards itself as a pioneer.To the Africans, Asians and other fast-growingchurches of the “Global South”, the issue ofhomosexual rights represents not liberation butthe threat of another enslavement, to decadentWestern liberalism.In Spain, meanwhile, everyone protesting madly that the worldwould come to an end if gay marriages were given the samebasic rights as other marriages were trumped by an "academic"who said homosexuality is "a disease."Professor Polaino told the Senate's Justice Committee thathomosexuality was caused by "a hostile, distant, alcoholicor violent father ... or an overprotective, cold anddemanding mother".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Homosexuals, he said, "did not playgames as children ... may have suffered sexual abusewithin the family ... are more likely to be promiscuous, takedrugs and suffer from schizophrenia".(Does going to the beach with Malibu Barbie count as playinggames?) The silver lining there? Even the people on the rightdistanced themselves from this nutjob and said his comments werebackwards and "from another age." It says something about thetimes when even people denouncing gays feel obligated not tocompletely denounce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or am I just being too Doris Day-ishabout the whole thing?
