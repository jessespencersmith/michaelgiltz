Do children experience it thesame way adults do? Why does it seem to slow down when we‚Äôre bored and speed by as we get older? How and why does time fly? In this witty and meditative exploration, award-winning author and New Yorker staff writer Alan Burdick takes readers on a personal quest to understand howtime gets in us and why we perceive it the way we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the company of scientists, he visits the most accurate clock in the world (which exists only on paper); discovers that ‚Äúnow‚Äù actually happened a split-second ago;finds a twenty-fifth hour in the day; lives in the Arctic to lose all sense oftime; and, for one fleeting moment in a neuroscientist‚Äôs lab, even makestime go backward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why‚Ä¶ Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say This wide-ranging survey of the latest ideas about time touches only lightly on popular culture, like HG Wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dive into Alan Burdick's book and you quickly find yourself immersed in talk of circadian rhythms and tales of scientists who sequesterthemselves into caves to see how a lack of sunlight and other triggers play havoc with their sleep cycle and sense of the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's playful, interesting and has as much fun with philosophical questions about time as with the latest insights of practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most accurate clock in the world?
