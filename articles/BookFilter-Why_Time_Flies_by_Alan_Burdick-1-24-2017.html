Do children experience it thesame way adults do? Why does it seem to slow down when we’re bored and speed by as we get older? How and why does time fly? In this witty and meditative exploration, award-winning author and New Yorker staff writer Alan Burdick takes readers on a personal quest to understand howtime gets in us and why we perceive it the way we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the company of scientists, he visits the most accurate clock in the world (which exists only on paper); discovers that “now” actually happened a split-second ago;finds a twenty-fifth hour in the day; lives in the Arctic to lose all sense oftime; and, for one fleeting moment in a neuroscientist’s lab, even makestime go backward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why… Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say This wide-ranging survey of the latest ideas about time touches only lightly on popular culture, like HG Wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dive into Alan Burdick's book and you quickly find yourself immersed in talk of circadian rhythms and tales of scientists who sequesterthemselves into caves to see how a lack of sunlight and other triggers play havoc with their sleep cycle and sense of the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's playful, interesting and has as much fun with philosophical questions about time as with the latest insights of practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most accurate clock in the world? Apparently, it's just a constantly moving target, with variousmeasurements around the globe averaged out so we can all agree on what time it was a few weeks ago at one particularShare This Book About The Author Alan Burdick MoreAlan Burdick is a staff writer and former senior editor at The New Yorker and a frequent contributor to Elements , the magazine’s science-and-tech blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His writing has also appeared in The New YorkTimes Magazine , Harper’s , GQ, Discover , Best American Science …, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His first book, Out of Eden: An Odyssey ofEcological Invasion , was a National Book Award finalist and won the Overseas PressClub Award for environmental reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: January 24, 2017 Publisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Pages: 320 ISBN 10: 141654027X ISBN 13: 9781416540274moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time is a hunch, a guess or entirely collapsible at will if you believe the new sci-fi movie "Arrival" starring Amy Adams. (Aliens scoff at our childish idea of past, present and future, apparently.) Does time fly when you're reading it? Only if you believe it can. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Alan Burdick offers a fascinating and searching account of how we perceive time’s passage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will change the way you think about the past, and also the present.” - Elizabeth Kolbert, author of The Sixth Extinction “Alan Burdick turns an obsession with the nature of time into a thrilling quest—one that brilliantly illuminates asubject that haunts us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time may fly by but at least while reading these pages it is never wasted.” - David Grann, author of The Lost City of Z “In his lucid, thoughtful, and beautifully written inquiry about time—what is it, really? Did we invent it, or does it invent us?—Burdick offers nothing less than a new way of reconsidering what it means to be human.” - Hanya Yanagihara, author of A Little Life and The People in the Trees “Burdick tours that unsettling passage of existence we call “time”—how our brains process it, how infants first grasp it, how our conversations encode it—and returns with a spellbinding, provocative book that will fill you with wonder.” - Robert Sapolsky, author of Why Zebras Donât Get Ulcers “A marvelous meditation on the subtle mysteries of time.” - Olivia Judson, author… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
