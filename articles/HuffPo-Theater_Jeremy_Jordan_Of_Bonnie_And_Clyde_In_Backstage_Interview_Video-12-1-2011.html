It helped that both were being directed by Jeff Calhoun,who believes in Jordan and knew he could handle the crazy work load (and of course nobody expectedNewsies to have such an immediate second life).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Former 'SNL' Star Makes Shocking Comments About Rape And Gay Friends Mitt Romney To Flood Victim: 'Go Home And Call 211' WATCH: Rachel Maddow At A Loss For Words After Clint Eastwood's RNC Speech Paul Ryan Admits Marathon Lie Eastwood Misfires 35 Awesome 'Simpsons' GIFs Strong-Arming Death: The Summer Wilson Story Celebs React To Eastwood's Wild SPeech Several Reported Killed In New Jersey Mall Shooting DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos September 1, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA CELEBRITY TV COMEDY FOOD STYLE ARTS BOOKS LIVE ALL SECTIONS Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy Drexler Gary Hart Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dennis Kucinich Kevin MaurerHOT ON THE BLOG Like 107 Posted: 12/01/11 12:06 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Entertainment Alerts Sign UpLike 1k Like 5k Like 2k Like 4k Like 4k Like 1k Like 1k Like 177 Recommend 3kOscars 2013 iPhone app iPad app Android phone app Android tablet app More Log in Create AccountThe good luck doesn't stop there: the very first time Jordan appeared on stage in Rock Of Ages, director Todd Graff ( Camp, a comedy about musical theater summer camp and Bandslam, the sweet teen comedy) was sitting in the audience having just written his next feature film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan soon found himself cast in the key role of Dolly Parton's grandson in the new movie Joyful Noise, which costars Queen Latifah and opens in January. (The trailer is at the bottom of the story.) He's also engaged to fellow Broadway star Ashley Spencer, who just left Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert to recover from foot surgery; they're getting married next fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spencer was one of two finalists in the talent competition Grease: You're The One That I Want -- the other was winner Laura Osnes, who ironically plays Bonnie Parker in Bonnie &amp; Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Osnes singing one of the show's best numbers -- "How 'Bout A Dance" -- in a short film about the making of the musical's trailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not all rosy: composer Frank Wildhorn has a patchy record commercially in New York and the New York Times ran a story asking investors why they would invest in Bonnie &amp; Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That just makes Jordan feel like an underdog and ready to stand up for a show he believes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just two days beforeopening night, Jordan took the time to sit back in his dressing room and cover his career and thepleasures of performing in this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan talks about a childhood without a lot of money, just like the two lead roles he's created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan says he can identify with the rage of Clyde much more easily than the rallying spirit of Jack, the kid fromNewsies who leads a strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An early accident ended his love of athletics and sent Jordan towards musical theater (a grandmother who ran the local community theater made it inevitable as well.) He candidly says that being straight can be an advantage when trying to land lead roles (along with those looks and that tenor voice) but also has taken to his Twitter account over the past two years to champion equal rights for gays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Born in Texas (just like Clyde), Jordan is a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan (and doing great in not one but two fantasy football leagues) and yet an offhand gift of a baseball cap when he was a kid made Jordan a New York Yankees fan as well. (Take that, Texas Rangers.) If he seems calm andfocused and happy for a guy about to face opening night, that's just the result of being a talented actorwho has seen just about everything going his way so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever the fate of his first new musical onBroadway, Jordan should be around for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy Drexler Why Itâ€™s Important To Let Your Child Make Mistakes Gary Hart Welcome to the American Republic, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eastwood TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Movies Usher White House Chicago Crime Bill Maher Penn StateColin Ferguson Shows Up At LA Premiere Spencer Matthews Talks About The Bachelor Winner Khloe Sean "Diddy" Combs Shows Some Love For Lawless When Can You See The Final 'Hobbit' Film?
