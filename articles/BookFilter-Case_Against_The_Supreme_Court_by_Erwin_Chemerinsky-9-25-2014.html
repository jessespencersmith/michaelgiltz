For all itsflaws, surely it has done more good than harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look at the Warren Court, he's always said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here the author -- ascholar of constitutional law and author of a standard textbook used in academia -- does indeed look at the WarrenCourt (which should have done more) and the long history of the Supreme Court (when it so often did far, far less).Again and again, he shows that it has sided with the powerful against the very people and principles it was designedto protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is at pains not to make this a liberal assault on the Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time and again, he gives examples thatpeople of all political persuasions can agree were poor choices of the Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he offers up red meat to the left, he'ssure to offer up red meat to the right with a counter example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As he explains the cases and the decisions made bythe Court from its early days to today, the case against the Supreme Court becomes compelling indeed, allpresented in clear and precise language any layperson can easily understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemerinsky makes nonsense of theidea that judges are somehow impartial umpires rather than driven by ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he offers practical steps thatwould improve the Court and its functions, everything from term limits to improving confirmation hearings to meritpanels that would recommend options for the President (an idea used around the world and by various statesincluding Alaska).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly Chemerinsky is passionate on liberal causes and makes no pretense otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet thecase he makes about the Court's myriad failures is eye-opening to anyone who understands the Supreme Court canand should play a unique and vital role in our system of checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chemerinsky has argued cases beforethe Court many times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he ruffles so many feathers in that group of nine (and not just Scalia) that it's almost hardto imagine him appearing before them again after this passionate work comes out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he does, it'll be worth campingout overnight just to get a ticket and watch. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
