(By the way, I love it when people auditioning introduce their song as if it's a hidden gem. "I'm going to sing an Otis Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

No, you're gonna sing the world-famous Otis Redding classic, please.) Good but he may be a little affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, he's married which cancels out his solid good looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valerie Reyes -- if the first week of Idol went astray in any way, it was including too many people on camera who were just grandstanding to get on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clueless singers are fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But people in silly get-ups or people pretending to be angry and going on an unconvincing tirade just because the cameras are rolling are a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quick montage is plenty entertaining for the real losers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reyes was genuinely clueless about her singing skills but she brought out the mean streak in Idol .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last season or so, Ryan Seacrest had developed a nasty habit of toying with kids he was intervieiwing by letting awkward pauses develop so that the kids would look stupid or blurt something out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seems to do the same with Reyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps he isn't given any backstory, but I assume he's clued in as to who is good, who has a sob story he might highlight and who is a dreadful singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That certainly seemed the case with Reyes since Ryan interviewed her specificallyabout clueless singers and how they laugh at them at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Reyes walked into the auditionroom and destroyed "Against All Odds." Cheap shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monique Gibson -- here, they got the balance of how to treat a bad singer correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monique was dreadful, but the she seemed to take the judges' reactions in a good-natured way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were friendly but blunt and it all seemed a relatively OK wake-up call until suddenly tears startedstreaming down her face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy and Paula and Simon all immediately comforted her and showedempathy and seemed taken aback since Monique had seemed stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show caught the pathosof her not realizing how little talent she had without making fun of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samantha Musa -- this was the singer whose sister peched on Simon's lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sang Aretha and had a rough high note but was pretty good.Blake Boshnack -- here Idol wrongly celebrates obsessive determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This guy has auditioned in about ten cities, including the time he dressed up as the Statue of Liberty (a moment Simon rightly ended after about two notes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sang "Stand By Me" and while Blake probably killed at his own bar mitzvah it was just absurd and sad for him (and his mom) to think he has a talent for anything more than karaoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was followed immediately by one of the new Idol songs -- sung by Rod Stewart over footage of Blake -- presumably meant for the montage scene when asinger is sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It included lines about how you should "never give up on your dream." Actually, that sentiment -- and the celebration of Blake's misguided, repeated auditions -- should be the OPPOSITE of the what Idol is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, you SHOULDN'T pursue your dream if your dream is playing in the NBA and you're 5 feet 7 inches tall and can't sink a basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The constant message of the show (in ways both mean and kind) is that it's not ENOUGH to want to be a "star."You have to have talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's not enough either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You also have to work really, really hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthat's not usually enough either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You also need a little luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the judges say you suck and willnever, ever be a professinal singer, that doesn't mean you should "persevere." It means you shouldfind a new dream and hopefully rethink the allure of fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk about mixed messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta -- a sweet-looking 16 year old kid who has the heartwarming backstory of fighting vocal paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His audition -- John Mayer's "Waiting On The World To Change" -- was pretty good, even though he forgot some of the words. (Oddly, I don't think thejudges mentioned this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more oddly, Simon praised this as a great choice of song even thoughit's been done on Idol before so hardly counts as groundbreaking.) He was also nervous, tentative, and failed to make eye contact very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decent voice but needs a few years ofseasoning and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's somewhat Tiger beat-ish and the judges rushed him through,which seemed to have as much to do with his backstory as his performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly Smithson -- an Irish lass who auditioned in a previous season and made it to Hollywood but her visa expired before she could go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a pretty devastating backstory, though what the Idol producers failed to disclose was that Carly later signed a major label record deal and had millions spent on her debut CD before it all fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't have quite the same tragic airabout it, does it? I don't mind backup singers and people who've been on the brink auditioning(even though it doesn't feel quite in the spirit of the show).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I MUCH prefer full disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ifyour band had a record deal and released a single on a major label, if you won Star Search when you were younger, if you had a hit single in Japan, I want to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, I need to know and Ifeel cheated if I discover this later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full disclosure, Idol producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly is going to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good, she has a fine voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she certainly knows the way there, in every sense and we shouldknow that in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...
