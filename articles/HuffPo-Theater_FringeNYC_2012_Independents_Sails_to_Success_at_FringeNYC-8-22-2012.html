(He does have the show's funniest line.) Not every character can be fleshed out completely and the actors make them wholly alive, but JT and Ari could use just a touch more backstory to explain who they are and why they're just frittering away theirtime like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug subplot feels too familiar, but then the book by Marina Keegan surprises you with how its handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not quite sure why just selling the boat might not be as helpful as claiming the insurance onit after an "accident" but then drug dealers like Chris don't always think straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But once the storymoves into this rather pedestrian avenue, the show pivots very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jaimy has been a one-note character of sorts (despite his addiction) but late in the show he has a monologue that is a genuine highlight and a rather bold mood stylistically, given where it falls in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We soon realize this isn't Jaimy talking but the words of the Revolutionary era figure he's been reading the journal of throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wording doesn't quite convince as the thoughts of someone from that period, but it's a wonderfulpiece that Hoffman delivers superlatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full credit to the lighting (Gary Slootskiy), sound (Emily Auciello), costumes (Isabelle Simone) and set design (Brian Dudkiewicz).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a show is going well, even minor distractions prove a boon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The theateris so intimate and the cast standing offstage so nearby that you can hear the creaking of their feet on thewooden boards -- but thanks to the setting, it actually sounds like the creaking of a sailing ship and addsto the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course in a show like this you immediately dive into the credits and bios of everyone involved (something I usually avoid until the show is over).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's when I discovered the bittersweet news thatIndependents unfortunately has a Rent -like backstory since book writer Marina Keegan died while working on this, her first musical .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was clearly a talent who made the most of every opportunity that came her way (a Yale student, she had already been published in the New York Times and had a short story heard on NPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll never know what was lost with her early death, but this work and the talentedpeople involved have clearly made the most of what she helped create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
