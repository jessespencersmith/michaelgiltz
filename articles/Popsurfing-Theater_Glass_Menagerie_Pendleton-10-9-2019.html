                <p>More Create Blog Sign In WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 09, 2019 THEATER: "The Glass Menagerie" Sans Tricks Or Treats THE GLASS MENAGERIE ** out of **** WILD PROJECT Sometimes, thankfully, you just do the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Classics can bring out the devil in artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What meta conceit can they slap onto a familiar drama to "bring it to life"? Change the time period? Perform it Kabuki style?Cast all men? All women? They become so desperate to leave theirstamp on a classic that they forget it's a classic for a very good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The play is worth doing, as is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This new production of The Glass Menagerie co-directed by the estimable Austin Pendleton &amp; Peter Block implied some high-concept makeover this war horse doesn't need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Press releases threatened it would be Wes Craven meets Tennessee Williams, with a score inspiredby The Exorcist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boo! Well, the trick was on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, the set is not filled with props made out of glass, just the usual display of glass animals ona side table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The score by Sean Haggerty is moody but not intrusive, as indeed are all the other tech elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, the sad and ghostly Laura (who already haunts the house when not roaming the streets) canoften be seen holding a lonely vigil behind a scrim when she's notonstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is your mother's Glass Menagerie and thank goodness for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's modest pleasures are a straightforward presentation of the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not tilted towards one character over theothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The directors don't strive you to think about what they're doinginstead of what Williams was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They honor the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This production may not catch fire, but at least it has the decency to hold the play up to the light and let it illuminate what they do, rather thanthe other way around.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (71) ▼ October (9) THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is OnSurely you know the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wingfield family is a sad group, living on dreams of yesterday or tomorrow because today is too depressingto bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The father took off years ago, leaving behind a wife and two children, his only contact being a postcard from far away stating "Hello Goodbye." His photograph looms over the stage and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mother Amanda (Ginger Grace) tells and retells about her glory days as a desirable catch, the bygone era when gentlemen callers would floor her porch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The daughter Laura (Alexandra Rose) pretends to go to typing school but spends most of her time wandering theparks of St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly, she hides at home, dreamily fussing overher glass menagerie, obsessing over a physical defect (a slight limp) and on rare good days remembering the boy in high school she fancied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The son Tom (Matt de Rogatis) struggles with the strait jacketof his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is trapped in a miserable job at a shoe warehouse, can'tfind a moment's peace to do the creative writing he longs for andwonders how he became the sole support for two women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not the one who chose to get married and have kids so why is his life over before it began? With one eye on heading out to sea as a sailor, Tom invites over an amiable coworker named Jim (Spencer Scott) as a potential love interest for Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim turns out to be the very high school boy she had a crush on, raising and then crashing all the hopes of the Wingfieldsone last time.Shaky Ground THEATER: "The Glass Menagerie" Sans Tricks Or Trea...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Wrestling With Faith in "Heroes Of The Fo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: A Bright Future In Reach For "Chasing Rai...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: The Not-So "Great Society" THEATER: BOO!

(Amanda is quite fragile and strange after all.) But this Jim is swept up by finding someone who remembers him the way he was and not the way he is.Her attention to him is just as intoxicating as his attention to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weak link unfortunately is Rose, making her professional debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a production titled towards the mother or son, her lack of readinessfor such a major role wouldn't matter as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the balance theystrive for simply can't work when one of the four legs of this sturdytable isn't ready to bear its weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's uneven and ultimately unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet a Glass Menagerie that doesn't attempt to outdo Tennessee will always be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
