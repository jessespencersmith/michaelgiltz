What's Your Reaction: Read More: American Idol , Ellen Degeneres , Fox , Kara DioGuardi , Michael Lynche , Pop Music , Randy Jackson , Reality TV , Ryan Seacrest , Simon Cowell , Entertainment News In a dramatic moment on American Idol, Michael Lynche received the fewest votes from the public and was in danger of being cut from the show -- a classic case where a talented performer somehow fell throughthe cracks and the very reason the "save" was invented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And indeed, the judges used their save and Michael Lynche is still in the competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That meansnext week two contestants will be cut from the showno matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The night began with the Idol contestants doing a Beatles medley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't be certain they were lip-syncing but I believe they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, simply the idea that their performance seemed canned is bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They all looked great in mod, black and white Sixties outfits, especially Katie Stevens (who inexplicably changed outfits during a commercial break).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three women were pronounced safe (a gender breakdown that often happens when one sex outnumbers the other).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara DioGuardi protege Jason DeRulo performed a snippet of one tune and thenhis hit, "In My Head" with fire, backup singers, a dangerously studded jacket and dance moves that allechoed Michael Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a strange gambit, they switched to slo-mo black and white in the middle of the live performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not a wise move for a new artist to my thinking -- let us get caught up in the moment; don't let us feel like we're watching a video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was ok overall, though the song was weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta delivered a piano-led encore of his rendition of "Imagine," this time including the lyrics "Imagine there's no heaven" that he cleverly skipped when in competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was good and the best guestperformance of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has he dyed his hair? Rihanna performed a Grammy-worthy spectacle of her new single "Rock Star 101." Another hip-hop song weak on melody (it's certainly no "Umbrella") but she could sell millions of downloads by showing us how she slipped into that skin-tight outfit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Playboy | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 41 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World WATCH: Demi Moore In A Teeny Bikini Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

(In a poor night, I only got two of the three right.) Aaron was safe and then to everyone's surprise, so was Andrew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew was the only one the judges wouldn't have saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Lynche did another strong rendition ofKate Bush's "This Woman's Work" and Simon Cowell -- with his usual dramatic flair -- announced he wassafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who, I wonder, will be the lead judge next season? They're gonna miss Simon and it should be Ellen, but will Randy feel dissed? What do you think? Who is the next lead judge and were they right to save Michael Lynche, ie. could he be in the finals? Because if he doesn't deserve to be in the finals, you shouldn't use the save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: 'Dancing With The Stars' Beats 'American Idol' For First Time NEW YORK â€” For the first time in the history of the two long-running competitions, ABC's "Dancing With the Stars" outdrew both editions of Fox's...

I would only save someone I thought had a great shot at winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't see Mike as winning this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't think of anyone who could command the respect that Simon has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll be watching Xfactor for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idol would have to shock me with someone great/inte resting to keep me interested .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree with the judges using the save for Mike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is exactly why it's there - to prevent a talented and deserving singer from being booted off too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike should have a shot at a record deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justbecause Ruben Studdard didn't sell records is no reason to deny Mike his chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The idea of someone as good as Mike leaving before the likes of Tim, Andrew or Aaron is simply unacceptab le.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should have been Andrew going home last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the judges could have kept the save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the respective fan bases will have to come out in force to protect the favorites like Crystal, Lee, Siobhan and Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mike is the best pure singer among the men and definitelydeserves another chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember when Jennifer Hudson got voted off way too early when shewas on Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The save could have prevented that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also think Lee was terrible with "Hey Jude".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He probably deserved to be in the bottom three just for that debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though I like him, I thought this was a trainwreck .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sacrificed vocals for performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ruben has a far better voice - not to mention ability to hold a note longer - than Mike.Ruben comes off as far more genuine than Mike, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BTW, the name of his family's groupis ...well, I'll just repost it here: The Lynche Mob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMG I thought the Lynche Mob was a pretty godawful name, too, I must admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SinceJennifer Hudson could have made the finale, I think she was a shame to leaveearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unless you think the person should be in the finals, does it really matterif they leave a week or two earlier or later than they should?

We should at least let them sing before putting them at the bottom :) They shouldn't have saved Big Obnoxious Poser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm still waiting for someone to tell him to keep hishands to himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go MamaSox, my favorite of all the Idols past or present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank God for the Intelligen ce of the Audience!! ! All year long I've stated that Michael Lynche was not that good despite the opinions of the Judges and the way the producers have made sure they high-light ed him every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally last night the audience let everyone know Lynche is not that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why doesn't he audience like him? Simple.... .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He does not look like an American Idol!

(btw, I'm so white myself, I'm practicall y CLEAR, so no racial bias here, tyvm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not a contest to see who is the best singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a contest to see who will sell the most MP3 downloads to the Nickelodeo n crowd currently on the cusp between boys and Barbies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't stand James' rapid vibrato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sounds like a nervous Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron can't handle the lownotes; Andrew and Lee have great sounds, but poor stage presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katie needs more seasoning,but I like her strong alto pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan is a good singer with a unique style and a great gimmick inher high range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Urban is Tiger Beat fodder, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal and Michael SHOULD be the top two finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The question is will the Brace Faces grow up and let the most TALENTED get to the finals of a TALENT competitio n? If its racial biased voting, how do you explain that two years in a row there were winnerswho were people of "color" as you put it, with Ruben and Fantasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exactly, Linda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those that show up here and try to make Idol a race-based contestare so out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynch is a goner because he is simply a mediocre performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Youcould tell from the auditions this year that this was a decidedly down year forAfrican-Am erican contestant s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would imagine that's because most such contestant s that are serious about getting record deals are into rap/hip hop, a genre that Idol's pop/countr y foundation ignores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leaves R&amp;B crooners, a small niche in today's market, for people likeMike and Ruben, who was a better singer than Mike, yet went on to sell fewrecords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Save was wasted, cause he'll justifiabl y be gone next week anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show's always been a popularity contest, but calling Mike "the best singer" when he clearly is not is simply wishful thinking, not reality-ba sed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Every Idol winner has been from the South except for Jordin Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the show hasbeen so racially diverse -- including when the audience votes, not just the UN-like plottingof the producers for the Top 24 -- and physically diverse I wouldn't say it was raciallybiased at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three out of 8 winners have been black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the South dominates becauseof voting and the advantage of being from a little state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big states on the coast like Florida,New York, California et al -- they don't really get excited by someone being in the top 10 oreven the finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a tiny state like Alabama can get really motivated and vote for theirhomegrown competitor .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For reasons of self-mytho logy, I think Texas behaves like a little state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The save was predictabl e, once it was revealed who was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We enjoyed Jason DeRulo's performanc e a lot!

The woman moves as gracefully as a cow...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorry! Michael has one of the best vocals on American Idol(but he definitely needs to fine tune hisintrument) , whilst Andrew is a one-note-s amba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everything sounds the same, and he really has no voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got a quirky voice, but that's it.The bottom three ought to have included Andrew, Aaron and actually Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I normally like him, buthe did a poor, poor job in his last performanc e, and the only thing that saved it was the bag pipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best of the night was surprising ly enough, Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wonderful rendition of one of my favourite songs(Jeal ous Guy)! A lot of disagreeme nt with you this week, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giltz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think this was the first week the live performanc e was actually live, and it sounded ten times better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the whole "Save Papa Mike" business was contrived from first to last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one in their right mind thinks Mike is going to win this thing, not the viewers and certainly not the judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And after Ruben Studdard sold virtually no records, the producers aren't going to let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why waste the only Save on a singer who won't be a finalist? What if Crystal, Casey, Lee or Siobhan end up chopped in the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saving Mike was the best use of that Save? Sure,they've played up the new daddy bit endlessly, but Andrew and Crystal are parents too, but it hasn'tbeen made a focal point of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the judges used it because (1) They wanted to appear generous to the New Daddy (2) the producers wanted to get it out of the way so we wouldn't have to go thru this excruciati ng huddling during the swan-song song anymore (3) They wanted to use it up, so they wouldn't appear toinfluence the outcome as it gets closer to D-Day...ho w could you save Crystal if Casey got bounced the following week...wou ldn't seem fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No question it was a risk using the save, but I suspected the minute Ryan said it would be a surprise eliminatio n it was either going to be Siobhan or Michael on the block and would have bet big money the Save was coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think the judges motives were as silly as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather, I think they view Michael Lynch as an artist with grea potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No question inmy mind that, unless he radically screws up in coming weeks, he will get a contract, winlose or draw, from someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't matter if he is in the Top Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a good marketout there for him.Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 10:46 PM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER emilyringstrom 02:16 PM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:23 PM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it MiraMcB 04:12 PM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 10:50 PM on 4/08/20102 Fans 59 Fans 16 Fans 43 FansThanks for commenting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a second viewing, I think the live performanc e was live as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I still didn't like it very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While having successful artists gives the show essential validity, what really makes money for the producers is the show itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great drama is whatmatters to them -- desperatel y trying to engineer a certain winner just isn't that important to them, especially since they sign multiple people out of the top ten anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I personallywouldn't have used the Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other singers should have left before him, but he won't be inthe finals and if I don't think he should be in the finals there is no reason to use the Save.The order of when others go home just doesn't matter that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was just sitting around thinking, "Was the Rihanna song on last night's show the worst song I'veever heard just on Idol or on TV, period, ever?" ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh wait, there was Puff Daddy's thing last week...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back to more important business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One Beatle fanatic, reporting for duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "shhoommpp p" effect in Come Together was derived from John tragi-prop hetically saying "Shoot me!" into the mic, coupled with a slapback-d elay effect, masked by a single handclap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there are four Beatles song credited or co-credite d to Ringo Starr (as real name "Starkey") .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides Don't Pass Me By and Octopus's Garden there were What Goes On, credited to Lennon-McC artney-Sta rkey, and Flying, from the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack , credited to Lennon-McC artney-Har rison-Star key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technicall y, George should have received co-writing credit for "Octopus's Garden".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gave the song a major overhaul between the time it was rehearsed during the Let It Be sessions and when it was recorded for Abbey Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since George already had two very solid contributi ons going onto Abbey Road -- including his first-ever A-side of a single with Something, as well as Here ComesThe Sun, he generously allowed Ringo to have the songwritin g spotlight alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor George, bursting with talent and Lennon/McC artney probably got antsy when he wanted to include more than one tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, even when they kept his contributi on down, those songs were "While My Guitar gently Weeps," "Here Comes The Sun,'" etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthen Frank Sinatra goes and calls "Something " the greatest love song in ages and always credited Lennon and McCartney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes you just can't win! Thanks for the info onRingo and the detail on John and "Come Together." I'd heard about "shoot me" before butdidn't realize it was supposed to be in that actual "shummmmpp pp" sound when he said it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In case there was any doubt, the last season of "Idol" should have dispelled it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winner of "Idol"is the person with the most sophistica ted campaign organizati on, not the person with the best voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox doesn't want to, or doesn't know how to, block programmed voting or timezone spoofingor any of the other tricks that have been used to game the voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And maybe that's not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If their goal is to produce a successful artist, then maybe it makes sense for them to go with the person who is best at working the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael apparently doesn't have an organizati on that is capable of engineerin g his victory, so it really doesn't matter how good his voice is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He won't win, but he's a cool guy with a great voice, and he'll have a decent career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The thing is, they get first refusals at offering record contracts to any and all of thecontestant s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So while there's a certain cachet in promoting a singer as an "American Idol", for every Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, they also end up with a Taylor Hicks andRuben Studdard, who don't sell squat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which is why the voting is just a lure for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They can let Kris Allen win, because they are going to put out the records by Daughtry and Lambert as well, so they have all thePermalink | Share it DCDan 10:11 AM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 10:53 PM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it Emmy2 06:19 AM on 4/08/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:39 PM on 4/08/2010256 Fans 2 Fans 0 Fans 43 Fans 2 Fansbases covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I have to disagree, I don't think Big Mike will have much of a career, outside of lounges/di nner theatre/ma ybe Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There already is a Luther Vandross, and he isn't even charting these days...the money and sales are in Hip Hop/Rap, and Mike hasn'tshown any proclivity for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People watch "Idol", obsess on its participan ts, and forget how many unnoticed good singers there are out there...I did a short documentar y film on church choirs, and my guess is there isn't a Baptist church choir in the country that doesn't have a male and female singer as good, and probably better, than Big Mike. ummm, maybe the reason that luther isn't charting these days is because he'spassed away. it's difficult to release new material from the grave. ...but thanks for your insight. /snark There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All "for every Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, they also end up with a Taylor Hicks and Ruben Studdard, who don't sell squat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which is why the voting is just a lure for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They can let Kris Allen win, because they are going to put out the records by Daughtry and Lambert as well, sothey have all the bases covered.
