(As a chart geek, I'll also point out she's the first living act to have two Top 5 singles and two Top 5 albums (with her debut back on the list) since the Beatles in 1964.) It's a good rule of thumb that your strongest song should be the first cut on the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather boldly, "Someone Like You" is the fitting finale to an excellent soulful pop album that shows Adele growing by leaps and bounds as a songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her first album edged onto my best of the year list, but it was as much for that powerful voice and the promise of the future as the fine album itself. (Great songs ended with"Chasing Pavements" but her singing carried the rest.) Watch her poise on Letterman as she belts out"Rolling in the Deep." Even the background singers are digging it: Adele's like a sane Amy Winehouse, an Alison Moyet with better solo numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's classic pop, including surging choruses, clap-along melodies, and lyrics that are sharp but universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as strong as thealbum is, you just know watching that clip she's even better live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's always been the acid test for mostartists -- being able to deliver live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Adele comes to NYC on May 21, she'll prove it. (Cruelly, I'll be atthe Cannes Film Festival and will miss her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again.) You can stream the entire album on MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So no excuses for not checking out one of the pure pop pleasures of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a good reminder that with the right voice and the right arrangement, lyrics that seem rather basic on the page can come alive on record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't poetry; it's pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why you sing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LOW ANTHEM -- SMART FLESH The Low Anthem have a rare quality for a rock band: patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They take their time on this spectral, haunted new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't just call it haunted because the first track is "Ghost Woman Blues."

They can also raise a ruckus, as shown on "Boeing 737" and "Hey All You Hippies." Butthey finish with the longest and one of the quietest tracks, the title tune "Smart Flesh." It takes its owsweet time because they have the confidence to know you'll keep listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A solid follow-up to the acclaimed Oh My God, Charlie Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can stream the entire album Smart Flesh on The Low Anthem's MySpace page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDS OF THE WEEK: CD #1 Ladysmith Black Mambazo -- Songs From A Zulu Farm CD#2 David Wax Museum -- Everything Is Saved CD#3 Adele -- 21 CD #4 The Low Anthem -- Smart Flesh SOME BEST CDS OF THE YEAR/DECADE LISTS: THE BEST CDS OF 2010 THE BEST CDS OF THE 2000s THE BEST CDS OF 2009THE BEST CDS OF 2007 Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.comRevealed: Who's Going?
