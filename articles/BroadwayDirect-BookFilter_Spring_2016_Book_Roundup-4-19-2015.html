Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is as good as Kazan‚Äôs autobiography, written on the fly with passion and humor and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DARK LADY‚ÄôS MASK By Mary Sharratt$26, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Did William Shakespeare ‚Äî that barely educated country bumpkin ‚Äî actually write those globe- spanning masterpieces? Who is the Dark Lady, the woman who haunts some of the greatestsonnets in history? Those are two of the greatest puzzles hovering over the life of the world‚Äôsforemost dramatist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Sharratt amusingly combines them both in this tantalizing novel of‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù In it, a cross-dressing poetess stumbles upon and falls hard for a penniless poetnamed William Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They abscond to Italy and begin collaborating on comedies andtragedies that will shake the world of drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When their romance ends, so does theircollaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Shakespeare the public face of their achievement, he garners all the glory ‚Äîand then taunts his onetime artistic partner with those sonnets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He should remember that hell hath no fury. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROMEO &amp; JULIET By William Shakespeare$7, Penguin ClassicsRomeo &amp; Juliet is one of the most assigned plays in schools around the country, the perfect introduction to the romantic, funny, rich, and tragic world of Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Pelican Shakespeare books are one of the most acclaimed modern presentations of the plays of theBard since the line‚Äôs birth in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is just one of many new editions that the imprint isreleasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each comes with a new cover and the usual essays and notes putting the plays intothe context of Shakespeare‚Äôs time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are handsome, portable, and a pleasure to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure,you can download rough copies of all his plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe you already have some weighty tome onyour shelf containing all the collected works, the sort of edition you display but never actuallyopen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet there‚Äôs an undeniable pleasure in holding individual copies of R&amp;J and Hamlet and Macbeth in your hands, dipping in when you‚Äôve got a moment, carrying them with you everywhere, making notes in the margins, and losing yourself on the page almost as much asyou can during a great performance.

Because On Broadway explores the last20 years of theatrical history via the posters and imagery created in tandem with SpotCo, thecompany founded by author Hodges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From working with the still grieving family of Jonathan Larson on Rent to the record-breaking revival of Chicago and right up to the selling of the hip- hop musical Hamilton , SpotCo has been in the thick of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For many people, name a show and the first image that pops to mind is the poster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Broadway turns the creation of those posters into a thumbnail sketch of the Great White Way over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It includesanecdotes featuring everyone from stars including Nicole Kidman and Sting to theater legendssuch as Harvey Fierstein and Cherry Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, of course, classic posters in all their glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WOMEN OF WILL By Tina Packer$16, Vintage If you ask us, playwright Eugene O‚ÄôNeill was almost always experimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This anthology focuses on key early works The Emperor Jones (notably providing a great role for black actors who sorely lacked them at the time), The Hairy Ape , and the one-acts set on board a ship, known collectively as The S.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glencairn Plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs a useful look at one facet of a prolific career best known for his lengthy tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GREAT AMERICAN WHATEVER By Tim Federle$17.99, Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers True, this young-adult novel is actually about a gay teenager who is crazy about the movies, not the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it‚Äôs by Tim Federle, the author of the bestselling middle-grade books Better NateThan Never and Five, Six, Seven, Nate, both amusingly fanatical about the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So he‚Äôs earned a lot of goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This novel is aimed at slightly older teens and charts the reawakeningof Quinn, a teen sunk into depression and guilt from the death of his sister in a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ina whirlwind week, Quinn falls hard for another guy, gets his hair cut, cleans up his room and hislife, comes out, and realizes that while their dream of being the first great brother-sister team inmovie history may be gone for good, in fact it might have just been his dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And life is still worth living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filled with movie references and a passion for the arts any theater lover canappreciate, Federle delivers his usual breezy humor, but here with a new undercurrent of maturity and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.THE 101 GREATEST PLAYS By Michael Billington$26.95, Guardian Faber Author Billington is as much a part of the U.K. theater scene as the National or Judi Dench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has lectured on the arts, published biographies of Harold Pinter and Peggy Ashcroft, and,above all, reviewed theater with passion and insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So yes, while you or I or just about anyonecould whip up a list of ‚Äúthe 101 greatest plays,‚Äù you or I or just about anyone probably isn‚Äôt asinformed and ready to create a list worth reading as much as Billington is. (He‚Äôs been reviewingshows for nearly 50 years and seen about 9,000 productions . . . and counting.) Mind you, it‚Äôsnot the list that really matters, choices that range from the ancient Greeks up to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚ÄôsBillington‚Äôs passionate arguments and essays about what he‚Äôs selected and why that will informand enrage and delight ‚Äî and likely send you off to read a few plays and make your own list in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COMPLETE BOOK OF LES MIS√âRABLES By Edward Behr$19.99, Arcade Publishing Hamilton is just the latest theatrical event to become a worldwide phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Les Mis√©rables was also a game-changing blockbuster that rewrote the rules of musical theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That‚Äôs where the comparisons end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton began Off-Broadway and was acclaimed from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Les Miz began in Paris and came to London, where the critics harrumphed at this glitzy, almost silly spinon Victor Hugo‚Äôs sprawling masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton looked forward to hip-hop for musical inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Les Miz looked back to opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both have fans who are passionate, to say the least.For those who didn‚Äôt dream of missing the recent Broadway revival of Les Mis√©rables , this reissue of the making of that masterpiece contains the full libretto and the rags-to-riches story of its unlikely success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PRODIGAL SON By John Patrick Shanley$13.95, Theatre Communications GroupA new play by the author of Doubt and the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Moonstruck will always be an event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it‚Äôs set in a prestigious boarding school, is strongly autobiographical, touches on everything from mentors to sexuality to the saving grace of education, and featuresa juicy central role any young actor would kill for, then it becomes essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actor Timoth√©eChalamet gave a career-making turn as the lead character and doubtless young actors all overthe country will be poring over the play, relishing his monologues and dreaming about what they would do with a chance to play this part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEX WITH SHAKESPEARE By Jillian Keenan$25.99, William Morrow Roger Ebert opened our eyes to the usefulness of acknowledging sexiness in film criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too often, the erotic is giggled over or mentioned quickly and almost with embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ebertdemonstrated that the appeal of actors is so fundamental to enjoying the arts that ignoring it isfoolish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the sooner you do acknowledge what turns you on, the sooner you can startthinking seriously about why and how it turns you on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer Keenan doesn‚Äôt know fromembarrassment, as her memoir makes clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She‚Äôs written for countless outlets, from The NewYorker and The New York Times to Scientific American and Playboy .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, Keenan combines her personal journey of realizing and accepting her own identity as a sexual masochist with aclose reading of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is genuine insight, from the (obvious) bondageand domination of The Taming of the Shrew to the (less obvious) sexual masochism of Helena in A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream to the (unexpected) possibility that King Lear is a sexual predator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn More About Hamilton BUY TICKETS KEEP READING:Another Hamilton Premiere: Hamilton: The ExhibitionDecember #Hamildrop: ‚ÄúOne Last Time (44 Remix)‚ÄùSEE ALL NEWS Join Our Newsletter General Info Find Shows Broadway Venues Jimmy Fallon Joins Lin-Manuel Miranda and Hamilton Cast in Puerto Rico</p>
