(Hope had no rapport with Johnny Carson but the details of how they andtheir teams interacted are sparse here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope's true heir is probably Jay Leno.) What Zoglin can't do is retroactivelyturn most of Hope's career into one of artistic accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite simply, most of his movies are bad and Zoglin'sdescriptions of their filming and subject matter are master classes in shades of grey as he makes fruitless distinctionsbetween projects that are merely awful from those that were lazily awful and the many that were godawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's alsoan exaggeration to say Hope was the only star to have top-rated success in every entertainment medium fromvaudeville to TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, no star ever accomplished that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Zoglin makes perfectly clear, Hope was arguably thelast major star launched by vaudeville but he was not a big vaudeville star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope made his bones in that area but thatworld was dying off and he was never a big draw in it. (In later years he would tour the heartland in a vaudeville-likestyle to huge audiences, but that was long after the vaudeville circuit was gone.) And as Zoglin makes even clearer,Hope was by no stretch of the imagination a Broadway star, though he does illuminate what Hope drew from theexperience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, Hope's recording career was negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That does nothing to detract from his remarkablesuccess as the biggest name in radio (the TV of its day) and movies, where one year Hope was indeed the biggeststar in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More significantly, Zoglin can't make Hope terribly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wasn't introspective enough tooffer insight into his own character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope wasn't cruel enough in private to make the contrast from his public personamore shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even to his children, Hope seems to have been little more than a public persona, though not in a sador fascinating way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's just the way he was: a man who came alive on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And again, despite some genuinelygood movies (namely the Road movies costarring the far greater artistic talent Bing Crosby) and some good one-liners, you don't want to return to much of his comedic work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope created a distinctive profile as the brash coward,the fast-talker with nothing to say, the sex crazy guy who probably wouldn't know what to do with the girl if he caughther. (Something that was assuredly not true with the real Hope right into his dotage.) It served him well throughouthis film career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He pioneered innovations that stars draw upon today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His tireless work entertaining soldiers poweredhis career but was clearly genuine, even if his deeply conservative politics ultimately made him out of touch with thechanging times and the Vietnam War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zoglin is especially touching as Hope becomes bewildered by the soldiers hecan't quite relate to as that disaster swamps Nixon and even for a while that ardent Nixon supporter Hope himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inthe end, the book is comprehensive but not penetrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not the fault of Zoglin: there isn't much to penetrate inthis story of a very commercially successful but essentially uninteresting man. -- Michael GiltzLess</p>
