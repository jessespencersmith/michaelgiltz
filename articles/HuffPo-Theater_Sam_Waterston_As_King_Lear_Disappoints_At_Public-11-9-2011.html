Another minor character pops up in overalls with the accent of a farmer from the heartland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When battle rages, we hear the sounds of World War I trench warfare for no particular reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This randomness infects the entire show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I quite like the chain mail curtain that clinks and clanks every time someone enters and exits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This curtain composed of chains hanging down moves forward and backward to open up or narrow the stage and would be ideal for a play dominated by war and is good here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it collapses into a pile that Learcan rest on, you are given the show's one modest flourish of originality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, the lighting and sound and costumes all feel adequate but uninspired since they've been given no direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fight choreography by Thomas Schall is notably weak, though perhaps he was working with neophytes when itcomes to swordplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One struggles to say something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one is bad, just...indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enid Graham and Kelli O'Hara have some fun with the viperish sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kristen Connolly makes no impression as Cordelia and thegreat Bill Irwin seems utterly lost as the Fool, capering about in an ugly yellow costume and desperately mugging and vamping and trying to make sense of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael McKean maintains his dignity as the duped Earl of Gloucester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Crane is fine in the role of Oswald until he's given an outrageouslybroad death scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here's some happy news: this is the first time I've seen Seth Gilliam of The Wire onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gilliam may have stumbled a tad on the text during the performance I saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he had presence onstage and Gilliam was imbued with a sense of purpose and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a villain can't enjoy the favors of two women of power while playing one off the other, what can he enjoy? I look forward to seeing Gilliam again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Waterston, he surely knows that sometimes a mountaineer climbs the same peak several times before they find the path to the top that's the most satisfying, whether because it's the swiftest or hardestor fulfills some inner sense of the "right" way to climb it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sometimes they get to the top only todiscover it's a cloudy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only a return visit can offer the promise of sun and a glorious view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale)The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Chinglish * 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
