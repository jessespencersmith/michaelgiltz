"I thought betrayal was your favorite word," he notes at one poi~~. "No, no,:' ~~¢. re.sf.0 .~d;; ~e .• "fiou.~ .ly.: "CTue~ t has .. a~b~~r ~ ·t.~_~.t.~qn~t.y?Jb .. &lt;~i.I\~?

Naturally, someone has to come into Eddie's life and shake him out of his lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That someone is Roger Baron (Robert Downey, Jr.), a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed youngster fresh out of law school who is willing to work for peanuts because his "life was changed" by one of Eddie's early court cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roger is pampered and well­ dressed, a conspicuous practi­ tioner of conspicuous consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a nice irony of Tnu Belin1er that the voice of so­ cial conscience for a pot-smoking '60s radical is an '80s yuppie in designer clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their righteous anger is stoked by an 8-year-old murder case in which a Korean named Shu Kai Kim was wrongly imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, Eddie and Roger work for free to ·see justice done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yugi Okumoto give$ a tough, interesting twist, to the in.­ nocent-man-behind-bars and he is just one of many fine supporting actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Downey, Jr. doesn't hav~ much to do as the side kick, but he does it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main attraction here is def­ jnitely Woods, who gives one of his more appealing and humorous performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even he can't make us a true believer in the hokey plot they're trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stop reading this trash and get to a theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worth the $5-a-pop evenlng price. · . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worth a matinee price, tops. · .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worth renting on videocassette: · Worth catching on HBO, maybe.</p>
