Still, you'll spend weeks watching it before you even realize those items are missing, That's how long it'll take to plow through this comfort food for people who love procedurals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here's a question: is Law &amp; Order the greatest franchise in US TV history? Here are some other contenders: Star Trek -- six TV shows (including the animated one), massively popular feature films and (as with all these franchises) there is more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you ignore the books and merchandise and movies and focus just on TV, this is a mighty impressive series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Simpsons -- Again, this is a monster when it comes to merchandising; it and Star Trek probably far outstrip L&amp;O once you add in movie and toy sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But focusing strictly on TV and even including Futurama, which isn't really a spin-off as such, this will have to settle for legendary classic rather than the title of biggest franchise of all time...unless that Krusty spin-off gets a move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All In The Family -- For pure TV dominance, All In The Family was a remarkable franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spin-offs and spin-off of spin-offs that still took place in the Bunker universe include Maude, The Jeffersons, Good Times, Archie Bunker's Place, Gloria, Checking In, and 704 Hauser (even the house got its own show).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it's a remake of a British series, so maybe they deserve the credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which brings us too....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Idol -- A spin-off from the UK series Pop Idol (which bizarrely floundered, letting Simon Cowell launch The X Factor and steal their thunder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, American Idol was itself a monster success, passing All In The Family by being the #1 show in the country for six years in a row (it's gonna do it again this season too). it has been duplicated all over the world to massive success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chalk up another one for the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hey, this isn't a sitcom or drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it was worth a mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which brings us to L&amp;O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Law &amp; Order -- It has launched four direct spin-offs, including the current hit Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (12 seasons and counting), Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent (ten seasons) and the less successful Law &amp; Order: Trial By Jury and Law &amp; Order: LA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Homicide: Life On The Streets is another direct spin-off from the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ran for seven seasons, featured major characters from the earlier show and included crossover episodes making it explicit that these shows took place in the same fictional world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York Undercover and In Plain Sight are more of a stretch but can make their arguments.Putting those two aside, that's still a tremendous amount of television springing from this one series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder they almost launched a cable channel devoted entirely to L&amp;O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which leads us to the boxed set of the future: it could contain all five series (once SVU calls it a day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it won't be complete because some other L&amp;O series will already be on the air or in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So a number of shows can compete for the title of biggest franchise of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for now, this is the boxed set to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
