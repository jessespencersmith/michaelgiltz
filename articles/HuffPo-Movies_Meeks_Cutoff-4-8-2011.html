In this Western set during the 1800s, three families are headed west with their guide Meek (Bruce Greenwood).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meek is either lost or being urged by residents of the Territory they're headed for to steer newcomers away to a certain death. (Too many Americans might turn the Territory over to the U.S. in avote, something certain independent settlers want to avoid.) Meeks may be clueless or cruel but theyundoubtedly need water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The capturing of a "savage" gives them a chance to ignore Meeks and use thisman to save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful InFOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Personal Finance | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: The Funniest People Not On TwitterMiranda Kerr &amp; Orlando Bloom Step Out To 'The The Funniest Someecards For Easter 2011Weekly Roundup of eBay Vintage Clothing Finds News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts Like 1 Posted: 04/ 8/11 03:02 AM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 2K Like 20K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCALThere you go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That it's, all delivered in an open-ended manner sure to frustrate general audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a cast Meek's Cutoff offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Dano is wonderful as a weak-willed man who only seems strong compared to his hysterical wife (Zoe Kazan), a woman who sees Indians lurking behind every tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The inestimable Shirley Henderson is wittily on target as a woman constantly keeping an eye on her wandering son and a husband who refuses water when it's scarce (to all of their detriment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenwood is wonderfully offbeat as the guide, and Will Patton is a rock of common sense as the husband of Williams, though their relationship is a little tense. (She's his second wife, and he seems uncertain about this woman with opinions.) Without a hint of modernism, Williams creates a strong, fascinating character who insists on seeing the captured "savage" (Rod Rondeaux) as a man and not just an object of scorn or even pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exceptionallywell-acted, quiet and observant, Meek's Cutoff is pure arthouse fare, which is meant as a warning for those who might want, you know, a little action or some answers, and as praise for a talented directorcoming into her own. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: 'Meek's Cutoff': Michelle Williams Gets Cartooned In Poster For a cartoon, this isn't very joyous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then, Michelle Williams is a seriousactress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Oscar-nominated actress stars in the upcoming film "Meek's Crossing,"...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Striking Distance Of Obama Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
