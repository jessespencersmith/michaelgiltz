"Falling Ill" contains 52 final pieces -- literally "last poems"-- each one precisely 15 lines in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's one a week perhaps for those with a year or so of facing death in their future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always mutable in his approach, I think the power of this collection will be strongest for those who see Williams here distilled down to his essence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anyone facing mortality -- reportedly, we all are to one degree or another -- willrelish the unsparing but generous attention to detail, the way Williams questions everything from his breathing (is it moreShare This Book About The Author C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams MoreC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams (1936â2015) published twenty-two books of poetry including, Flesh and Blood , which won the National Book Critics Circle Award; Repair , which won the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry; and The Singing , winner of the National Book Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams was awarded the Ruth Lilly … Release Info List Price: $23.00 (Hardcover) Published: January 03, 2017 Publisher: Farrar, Straus and Giroux Pages: 64 ISBN 10: 0374152209 ISBN 13: 9780374152208labored than yesterday?) to the look in his beloved wife's eyes (which is hopeful, a hope that can almost but not quite mask her panic) to death itself, to whom he mutters and questions and confronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's philosophical and wry and rages with a beautiful, restrained passion that is all the more moving for being so seemingly controlled. "Focus" is the word that springs to mind again and again when reading this collection and surely a diagnosis of terminal cancer might provide at least that.Cancer is not a gift but Williams has delivered one by looking it squarely in the eye. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
