The gacaca trials are an extraordinary event: people who watched their families get slaughtered are asked to confront the killers in the hope of some sort of reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The killers, in exchange foran admission of guilt, get a reduced sentence. (The accused invariably try to admit to as little aspossible while the survivors fight despair and hopelessness just to find the strength to take part.) It's not forgiveness as such, perhaps, but just the ability to live in the same community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick Reveal Twins' Names READ MORE Gosselins Go Their Separate Ways READ MORE Ellen DeGeneres &amp; Portia De Rossi 'Happily Married Without BIG NEWS : Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 | Celebrity Skin | Tom Cruise | Celebrity Kids | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam FAKE!

That won't be known for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But two things are clear: the example of the gacacas have been spread by Aghion's films and inspired other violence-wracked communities around the world to adapt them to their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And more important than the question of whether the gacacas or indeed anything can bring a resolution to such a terrible event as the genocide is this fact about the process: it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gacaca trials took place and that is remarkable in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spoke with Aghion in the midst of Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 30 minute interview is below broken into four sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was shot on a Flip Video and there was no lighting or makeup or extra mike for sound (which is low, but clear).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is facing the sun so that is a factor as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aghion was generous with her time and accepted the crude conditions for this filmed chat and I thank her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to the film's website for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne Aghion Interview Part One Part Two Part Three Children' READ MORE More Celebrity News at People.com Don't Miss HuffPost Bloggers Gavin Newsom The Nation's Most Ambitious Recycling Law T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boone Pickens Propane and the Pickens Plan Popular Stories on HuffPost Johnny Depp As Mad Hatter, HelenaBonham Carter's Red Queen And Anne Hathaway's WhiteQueen: FIRST LOOK (PHOTOS) The Tim Burton...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Sanford: WhereIs He?
