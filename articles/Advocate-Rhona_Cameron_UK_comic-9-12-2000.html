                <p>r omedian Rhona Cameron stole bottles of champagne in Scotland ("Until I was caught," she adds) and sold dodgy paintings door-to­ door Down Under. (She'd followed a particularly ap­ pealing woman to Australia .) Now she wants to make a go of her first BBC sit­ com, Rlwna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of police or skepti­ cal art buyers, now all Cameron has to deal with are reporters who keep calling her show the British EUen. "It's not a lesbian sitcom," she says gamely, which is just as true as saying Friends is not a straight one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a show about Rhona, a video reviewer for a tiny London-based magazine, who wants to make movies. "My character is on a quest for happiness that she thinks she can get through manipula­ tion, which goes completely wrong," explains Cameron . "She's like George on Seirl/eld. " Right down to its charming ly dorky theme song, which she cowrote and sings, Rhona is a childhood fantasy come true for the 34-year-o ld comic, who grew up loving the "loose and fast and real" humor of America's Rhoda. "I have to admit, I always wanted to be on TV and have my name on things," says Cameron, chatting at a cafe in Lon­ don after a whirlwind of press to pro­ mote the shows late-July launch. "But I didn't really start seriously thinking about this show or working on it until three years ago, when we started pitch­ ing the idea I just thought it was a natur­ al progression for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I asked an ex-girl­ friend of mine who's been my friend for about 16 years to write the sitcom with me because we've shared sort of the same life and the same humor." As with many comics, Cameron's early life didn't provide a lot of laughs while she was living it British by birth, she was adopted by Scottish parents and raised in Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though she had a perfectly nice boyfriend at the time, she lost her virginity to an older man living next door who kept pestering her. "I don't know why I didn't do it with [the boyfriend] , though I did do it with him later," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the sex? "It was ... nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like getting a foot massage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I dumped him at 16 for this de­ ranged girl that I had fantastic sex with all the time. " Cameron is quick to disabuse anyone of the idea that she had a happy, randy, angst-free childhood . "Oh, no, no, no-­ terrible angst," she exclaims. "Oh, God! Angst! I lived in a small Scottish fishing town, and when I hit puberty I was very badly bullied until my father died, and then I think people felt sorry for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I had a really bad time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was spat on and beat up, and my back was drawn on in chalk. "My mom was really rubbish when I fi­ nally [came out]," says Cameron. (Ameri­ can translation: Mom was no help at all.) "Then we went through three years of hell, and all of a sudden it became OK again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I had strong feelings around about the age of 13 that I must try and not be gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I used to write in my diary, 'I will not be queer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I will like David. '" She laughs at the memory. "I have to say, I was so driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My sexual desire was so strong, it pretty much dominated most of my childhood-apart from other nice things like death and loss and abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I wasn't dwelling on those three things, I was dwelling on my constant sexual frustration about women." That led to her pursuit of the woman Down Under, which ultimately led her to London, where Cameron talked her way into a role for a "really bad women's co­ op feminist film." The movie was noth­ ing, but a woman she befriended on it told Cameron to try out stand-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now she's gone on to host or appear on countless TV shows, most notably four seasons hosting Gay time TV, a fluffy chat show that gave her a chance to interview everyone from k.d. lang ("She didn't even notice me") to Martina Navratilova ("Now, we had a really good rapport").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also given her a chance to see how quickly and easily gay and les­ bian celebrities--who've always seemed more open in the United Kingdom than in the United States-can push the boundaries of what's acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, Gay time TV soon went from groundbreaking to old hat television Lesbian comic Rhona Cameron plays the lesbian lead in Rhona, her new BBC sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is she EnglandJs answer to Ellen DeGeneres? By Michael Giltz an lelly "My sexual desire was so strong, it pretty much dominated most of , When I wasn't dwelling on those three things, I w THE ADVOCATE 1441 SEPTEMBER 12, 2000 arts&amp;eDtertaiDmeDt "Gay time IV got mostly parmed," ex­ plains Cameron . "It was on BBC2 for four years, and the idea was an enter­ tainment program for gay people, just as normal and regular as can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There'd been an earlier show that was more agit­ prop, and they wanted this to be light and fluffy, like daytime television." The mix made for some awkward juxtapositions. "On the one hand, you'd talk about Take That splitting up, and then you'd talk about gay funerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd talk to someone about dying of AIDS, and then you'd switch to gay bath towels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But other programs came on, like Queer as Folk, that took it so much further-where being gay was just mat­ ter-of-fact-that people felt Gay time was a bit dated." Now Cameron hopes to change the rules again by starring in a funny sitcom that, like Will &amp; Grace in the United States, just happens to be about a gay character. "In one episode called 'Birthday Girl,' I start dating a really beautiful middle­ class solicitor with glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've gone off her, but I'm keeping her for my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've speeded up the intimacy too quickly, but I've got to keep her for my birthday because she looks good for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a line in it where I say, 'Just because I'm a lesbian I don't have to be deep.' " What is deep, however, is Cameron 's amazement at her own success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's been in a relationship for about a year with a woman she wants to spend the rest of her life with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her TV show is air­ ing on the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now she's looking to tackle her favorite love: movies. "It seems ridiculous to me because everything I've ever wanted is happen­ ing," she says. "If I can go from nothing to doing stand-up and then getting a sit­ com with my name on it, why shouldn't I be able to write and direct a film? It's in­ credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes I have three or four days without feeling despair." • Giltz is a regular contributor to several publications , including the New York Post and Entertainment Weekly. ~ Find more on Rhona Cameron and her sitcom at -U www.advocate.com ~ildhood- from OIlIer nice Ihings like deaIh and loss and abandon ...... welling. my constant sexual fruslrati. about women."
