"A Thousand Nights"doesn't quite hit greatness but it's solid in ways that bode well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One has the sense Johnston is just stretching hermuscles here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're not left with a cliffhanger, but nonetheless she impatiently leaves the reader wanting more. --Michael GoltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
