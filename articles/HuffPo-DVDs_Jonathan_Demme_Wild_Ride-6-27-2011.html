Avant garde experiment with an exceptionally vividand unusual score by Toru Takemitsu? A classic noir via Camus? All that and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great subversive fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BLOW OUT ($29.95; Criterion) -- I don't think you can make the argument anymore that Brian De Palma is an important filmmmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you were going to, you'd certainly include this 1981 remake of Blow-Up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of a photographer, John Travolta plays a sound effects guy who thinks he may have captured evidence of a political assassination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like Coppola's The Conversation merged with the paranoia of the era and De Palma shows his usual restraint by throwing in every trick in the book to tell MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

He made twodozen silents until he segued into sound, but only five of them are known to still exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eclipse presentsthem all, including such seminal Naruse as the story of an aging geisha despised by her son (thinkMildred Pierce ) as well as the tale of a waitress who becomes trapped in a loveless marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does notguarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover eachweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does not obligate him in any way to speak positively about their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Sponsored Links Hyatt Summerfield SuitesÂ® TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 12 Halle Berry's Flawless Bikini Bod Olsen Sister Flashes HerBra Scarlett's naked pics, TylerPerry is highest paid MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 More Entertainment News at THR.com More Celebrity News at People.comMissoni For TargetMerchandise Floods eBay Scarlett Johansson Contacts FBI AboutHacked Nude Images Scarlett Johansson Becomes A Twitter Trending Topic Mark Ballas and Pia Toscano Split READ MORE America's Got Talent Picksa Winner READ MORE Michaele Salahi Was NotKidnapped as HusbandClaimed READ MORE Cher Lashes Out On 'Terrified' Chaz Bono Haters Anna Faris On Her Boob Job &amp; Bulls*it Women Actress Friends PHOTOS: Johnny Depp Gets Creepy Like 2KPaul Rudd In Playboy: Self- Loathing, Nudity And...
