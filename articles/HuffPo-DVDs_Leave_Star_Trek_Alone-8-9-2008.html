If only Charlie Chaplin's City Lights had spoken dialogue! If only Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood were in 3-D! If any of those sentences make any sense to you, then you maybe delighted to hear that the TV series Star Trekis being released on DVD in a new and"improved" version that cleans up and removesold special effects and inserts brand new onesthat never existed, all to make one of the mostsuccesful franchises of all time...what? Moreaccessible? It's bad enough when filmmakers do this to their own movies -- Francis Ford Coppola, GeorgeLucas, Peter Bogdanovich and many others constantly fiddle with the DVD releases of theirmovies, revising and re-revising classics again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My rule of thumb: a filmmaker can dowhatever they want, but ALWAYS make sure the original theatrical release is available in itsoriginal form, preferably in the same set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anything else is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Star Trek The Original Series Complete Second Season ($84.98; Paramount) release is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just watching the first episode -- the fan favorite "Amok Time" -- reveals numerous touches and changes and tweaks and wholesale additions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The title sequence has been changed, with a new sleeker ship identical to the old but far more detailed on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The planets seen in establishing shots seem to be more vivid and detailed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most notably, when Kirk, McCoy and Spock visit the planet Vulcan for a marriage rite, there's a new shot of the location that shows a dramatic stone bridge that people are crossing to a site that is high up in th sky on a lonely peak, with a major city visible far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's eye-catching and well-done and very likely if Gene Roddenberry had been able to afford such a shot at the time, he would have wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More subtle are those new shots of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to the excellent boxed sets released just four years ago, and you can see the ship floating through space - the ship itself is so grainy, you almost feellike you're watching old newsreel footage about the Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what's most striking is how Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Isn't worrying about spiffing up an old TV series just the fuddy-duddy moanings of a critic? I used to berate my brother for watching movies that were chopped and cropped for videoand told him how he had NO IDEA of what the movie was really like and how this editing andpanning and scanning ruined every frame of the film and was like removing the drums and bassfrom a Rolling Stones album or chopping out a third of a panting from its frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He didn't care.But now that it's so much easier to see movies in their original aspect ratio, he and everyone else expects movies to be presented that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the opposite is true with this faux improvement of Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's getting easier and easier to slap in new effects (as well as cheaper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colorization never made any money -- not because regular folk cared one way or the other but because the process was so ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon, they'll be broadcasting new episodes of I Love Lucy in fake color and people won't even realize it's been changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does it matter? Heck yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every grainy image from Star Trek gives you a subliminal idea of when it was made and by who; it lets you know the resources they had to tell the stories they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The classic Dr Who series in the UK usually had aout $20 a week to spend on special effects. (And half of that went to tea from the looks of it.) Those lame effects are key to the charm, in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On StarTrek, their top-notch effects for TV were well-regarded at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they are essential to enjoying and appreciating the show that was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can't improve a book by condensing it or dumbing down the wording for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was horrified recently to see my nephew (about 8 years old) reading a dumbed-down version of Treasure Island,a book any intelligent kid can read IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM right around that age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also hadMoby-Dick, a book which isn't a kid's book by any stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the point of having them read, "Hi, my name is Ishmael"? You are destroying history when you distort and change a work of artfor any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doing it to a TV show that has proven so wonderfully durable is just insane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes,people won't notice unless you point it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's the danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'll never know that theyaren't really watching Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And some sliver of pleasure derived by watching a series that wascrafted 40 years ago in its original form will be lost forever. (To top it off, they preserved one aspect of the superior 2004 editions -- the one aspect I didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The packaging is cute and clever and almost laughably awkward and difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simply takingout a DVD from the packaging is an annoying pain in the neck.) Also out this week: Foyle's War 5 -- The fifth and final batch of shows from the British mystery series ($49.99; Acorn) set during World War II and starring Michael Kitchen in a career-capping performance as Foyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kitchen is so smart and low-key in this series, half the fun is watching him squeeze mountains of meaning out of a word or two or just a quizzical look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Famously, he always urged them to cut down Foyle's dialogue to the absolute minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the show had gone on any longer, Foyle might have become mute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically, these last three episodes involve such war topics as shell shock, suspicion of German immigrants, spies and the such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without tying up the loose ends too nicely, there's a wonderful sense of finality as V-E Day looms, right down to the convincing air of confusion for some characters whose lives have been defined by the war and aren't quite certain they want it to end (notably Sam, Foyle's driver played with pluck by the beautifully namedHoneysuckle Weeks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foyle is unquestonably one of TV's great characters and if the series isn'tquite in the absolute top rank, it's damn close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And fans of mysteries should certainly consider itessential viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I Love The 80s -- It seems like a silly bit of branding -- slapping an "I Love The 80's" logo on a bunch of movies doens't really make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, these movies do seem to be of a piece and fitting reminders of an era when Hollywood moved from the idiosyncratic flicks of the 70s to thecommercial crowd-pleasers of the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't mean they're always good, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Footloose is much more dated and silly than I expected, especially that slow-motion game of chicken between "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

TV Roundup -- The flood of releases is never-ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out recently are Masters Of Science Fiction ($29.97; Anchor Bay), a very good anthology series with top actors like John Hurt, Judy Davis and Brian Denney and hosted by -- of all people - Stephen Hawking and unfortunately gone in the blinkof an eye; Get Smart Season 1 ($24.98; HBO), the enjoyable dumb spoof series too stupid to realize (apparently) that it should have come out right before the feature film spinoff, not weekslater); The Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle Show ($29.98; VSC), a kids Saturday morning sketch show that numbered John Lennon among its fans; Robin Hood Season Two ($79.98; BBC), the recent BBC spin on Robin Hood that is nowhere near as bad as the New Age-y version from theearlier 80s but not nearly as good (of course) as Errol Flynn's movie; Wayside School Season One($19.99; Paramount) is a nicely off-kilter animated series based on the books by Louis Sachar;Family Ties Season Four ($39.98; Paramount) was at a peak with Alex dating Ellen and Mallory dating the goofball Nick -- it was downhill from here; fans of Heart and R.E.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speedwagon canenjoy concert films captured on the TV show Soundstage in hi-def ($24.99 and $19.99 respectively;Koch); Sunset Tan Season One ($19.98; Lionsgate) proves that not every setting is ripe for reality TV; Masters of Horror Season Two ($86.97; Anchor Bay) is the Showtime horror anthology series that delves into a genre rarely tackled on TV anymore but the DVD set is a bunch of looose DVDsinside a skull that -- just like the Star Trek set above -- is just frustratingly hard to actually use; fans of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz should jump all over Spaced ($59.98; BBC) that has nothing to do with sci-fi and everything to do with slackers and helped launch the creative teambehind those movies; and finally if you're loving the glimpses of China during the Olympics, pickup Wild China ($29.98 and $39.98 on Blu-Ray; BBC) for a closer look at that country's diverse wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cars Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Bank Of America War Wire Video Financial Crisis MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

(The reason I say that this will have to be done to TNG is well is because the effects for TNG were done on SD video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a couple of shots from the TV series converted to film in "Generations," andyou can easily tell which ones they are even on the SD DVD.) EdwardEdwards See Profile I'm a Fan of EdwardEdwards permalink There's an elephant in the room, and it's that CGI sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sorry, but if CGI was what it needs to be, NO ONE would be complaining about the updated effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be seamless to the old fan's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd see what once was, with more clarity and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead,all I see are graphics from sophisticated PC games chiming in and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know in the WIZARD OF OZ, when they first see it? That 2-D deco painting on the far end of the set? I'd LOVE IT if it were updated to look real and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However: it can't look like a video Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:31 PM on 08/24/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: Leave Star Trek Alone! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-leave-emstar-trekem_b_117937.html [4/5/2009 1:47:16 PM] game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has to look like it's really there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it looks 'fake', it's as lousy as the 2-D painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody seems to get this...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helzapoppin See Profile I'm a Fan of Helzapoppin permalink I dont mind cleaning up original effects, but am firmly opposed to the outright replacing old effects for new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am so sick of producers going back and meddling with the originals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Star Wars fiascois a prime example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucas could have gone back and cleaned up a lot of glitches in the original effectsbut instead left those flaws and inserted his annoying new slapstick cg creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wonteven watch those altered versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I grew up with the original Star Trek with all of its period quirks and imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cleaning up grainy images is fine, but otherwise leave it alone. ramblingjohnny See Profile I'm a Fan of ramblingjohnny permalink I don't see what the problem they did label this release the Remastered edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the original is still out on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It not like they did a "Lucas" and took the original release out of circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And quitefrankly have you ever watched TOS on HD? It was a painful experience before the Remaster hell evenTNG look like crap on HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fan would overlook it but the remastered edition is aimed at enlarging thebrand audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrisallalone See Profile I'm a Fan of Chrisallalone permalink Thanks for writing this blog, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When we heard about the plan to release these new versions, myhusband went out and bought all three seasons on DVD, for the same reason you cite -- they're goingto go away, and the "new" version will become Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Trek is a product of its time in many ways beyond the FX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Myself, I think that preserving the original images, limitations and all, helps remind the viewer that the show's ideas andsocial commentary (including the occasional gaffe like the deeply sexist "Turnabout Intruder") wereshaped by its times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Context matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An acquaintance went to Italy some years back, I believe, to see the Sistine Chapel before it was restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was to be made brighter and livelier, and yet he said, "See it now, before they ruin it." Star Trek is no Sistine Chapel (although it did have Christine Chapel!), but it is what it is, and as another old lady born in the mid-sixties, I don't believe it has to look fresh and young to be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think its looks were really what made it cool, and I regret that they will be gone from sight. mredder4 See Profile I'm a Fan of mredder4 permalink How does that song go again? "moneymoneymoney-money...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONEY!" No flagship show, no successful movies, no more Las Vegas attraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I believe ST is now limping along on book sales from the psuedo-novels and the minor fees garnered from syndication on low-viewership networks like Sci-Fi and SpikeTV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I say this sadly, as a fan of ST:TNG and DS9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let the studios do what they need to to make the venture profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're going to need all the money they can get out of it, at least until they dump the folks who brought us and approved of Voyager and Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The premise needs a real reboot to become successful again, and if they're smart, they'll take a page out of the BSG playbook to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less tech, more character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for fans, well, any fan of ST that is so because of the new versions is still a fan, regardless of what version they saw first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, there will be differences between what some fans have seen compared toothers, but hey, that at least stimulates dialogue, which is good for ST in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Of course, they expect a major reboot from the new film version overseen by JJ Abrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idon't expect any radical rethinking a la Battlestar Galactica, however, though that's certainlythe gold standard at the moment for reviving a franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:33 PM on 08/13/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:44 AM on 08/13/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:39 AM on 08/12/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:15 PM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:52 AM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:31 PM on 08/11/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: Leave Star Trek Alone! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-leave-emstar-trekem_b_117937.html [4/5/2009 1:47:16 PM] jamesspada See Profile I'm a Fan of jamesspada permalink I basically agree, but I don't think this is as bad as colorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upside may be that the more money the StarTrek franchise makes, the more likely it is that Paramount will mount a new show thattakes place in the 25th century or later, in a setting that allows for a number of different species to interact, as in DS9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This, I'm sure, would prove much more successful than Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I think if the movie works, they'll stick to movies for a while before launching another TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shows sort of undercut the excitement behind a movie and the movies can makeso much money and are jsut easier to sustain than a weekly series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really, another decadewithout a new ST series on TV is a good idea given how they ran the show into the ground. recless See Profile I'm a Fan of recless permalink Truthfully, I prefer the new version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't help it but I wasn't around for the original, and after gettinginto Star Trek with the Next Generation, well...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like the originals but I can't help but find a lot of the effects to be just "campy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, a lot of fans are like me... the ships and the tech are what is facinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Couldn't care who Picard or Kirk or Sisko are kissing, just let me see that Federation/Klingon warfootage from DS9 and I'm a happy camper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never found any of the characters to be very "deep",not compared to Captain Sheridan from Babylon 5 (as an example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best sci-fi for me is stuff likethe Honor Harrington series, where the ships and their use plays a big part of the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also doesn'thelp Star Trek that Paramount screws up timelines and histories with shows like Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BlackJAC See Profile I'm a Fan of BlackJAC permalink HONOR HARRINGTON started getting repetitive by the end, at least in terms of all the battlesequences: task forces composed of four dozen megabattleships apiece and twice as manyfrigates or cruisers or destroyers on each side, each firing several hundred missiles, most ofwhich get intercepted by point defense anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of planets they would've had tomine hollow and depopulate to get the materials and crew for all those ships...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for the perspective (though it depresses me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't read any of the HonorHarrington books; I'll have to check them out. (And I hope you've checked out the HoratioHornblower books by Forester or the Aubrey/Maturin books by Patrick O'Brian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or if you'vegot to have a sci-fi/fantasy trapping, the really clever new Napoleonic era w dragons books byNaomi Novik. deckard70 See Profile I'm a Fan of deckard70 permalink "The classic Dr Who series in the UK usually had aout $20 a week to spend on special effects...Thoselame effects are key to the charm, in a way." You're not aware that the DVD releases of Doctor Who have new effects, I take it? Not only does the Doctor Who Restoration Team seek out the original film pieces to reassemble the episodes in betterquality than when the show originally aired, they also render new special effects for laser blasts and other effects that could not be done properly at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway, the test for Star Trek for me came when a friend saw a few minutes of the improved version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he did not notice that the effects shots were new, indeed he was skeptical that they were newafter I told him (since they still look cheap -- just CGI cheap rather than 8mm grainy film cheap).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, Ithink that's proof enough that the new effects blend in well enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I had no idea about the Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who fiddling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for letting me know. (In general, I think theDr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who releases have been so sporadic and crazy -- they've got thousands of episodes; forheaven's sake, just release a boxed set w every Tom baker Who, etc and be done with it.) Iagree that the new effects are well done and blend in seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's exactly what bothersme -- unlike bad colorization, you won't know something is up and without careful labeling (at Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:08 AM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:31 PM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:02 AM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:30 AM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:53 AM on 08/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:17 PM on 08/10/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: Leave Star Trek Alone! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-leave-emstar-trekem_b_117937.html [4/5/2009 1:47:16 PM] least the Star Wars movies Lucas messd w are called Special Editions) or even access to the classic original versions, fans won't have any idea what they're watching ain't the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andsince reruns on TV will invariably be the new improved editions, the originals that proved sodurable and entertaining for the past 40 years will disappear from view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, you can add innew effects and newcomers won't notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why? bcw See Profile I'm a Fan of bcw permalink I think one consideration that is missing from the conversation is the quality of the restored footage.Footage not containing effects can be restored by going all the way back to the original cameranegative (if possible) resulting in a pristine shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Effects shots have gone through numerous generations of optical printing thus degrading them to a grainy, contrasty, desaturated mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps one of the factors in the decision to replace the effects shots was that they couldn't be restored to the level ofquality of the rest of the footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can even see this problem in the dissolves from one scene toanother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From what I've seen, the shots containing dissolves in this restored version are noticeably grainier than the rest of the footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This again is the result of the optical printing process that created the dissolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I'll bet that's exactly why some shots of the Enterprise in the 2004 remastered editions look so grainy and out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a good artistic argument (better than -- gee, why not throw in a bunch of new effects so the kids won't think this show was actually made 40 years ago) but they lose the high ground by throwing in entirely new scenes or adding in shots of the ships in battle completely different from the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, no one complained about this in 2004 with the excellent remastered versions. robiform See Profile I'm a Fan of robiform permalink I am of the opinion that if the director/producer wants to enhance a movie or television show, then he/she should also make the ORIGINAL version available on the DVD or Blu-ray as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of themany charms of "Star Trek" (the original series) was the very cheesy special effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, it was thelate sixties, and Gene Roddenberry didn't have the budget that Stanley Kubrick had for "2001: A SpaceOdyssey".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the original "Star Wars" movies, I don't think that the enhanced versions added all thatmuch to the overall enjoyment of them, and I was very glad when the first three movies were releasedon DVD with both versions available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm a firm believer in artistic freedom, but having seen the"original" versions of movies and television shows many times, I like being in a "comfort zone" whenbeing with old friends! YMCA See Profile I'm a Fan of YMCA permalink Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like seeing Star Trek effects revamped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's awfully cool.... but, I will always have theoriginals on DVD too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then again, there is always the argument that you can't experience the way Star Trek was unless you have a 1970's television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why complain? Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn't agree with you more, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's hugely different issuewhen the driving creative force is dead and therefore not available to sign off on thesechanges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't care if his widow and the keepers of the flame approve, it still ain'tRoddenberry saying "go ahead." Finally, the big point you make that agree with is that thesechanges absolutely do NOT improve the movies/tv shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even when modest tweaks areoverseen by the director himself and do seem to be an improvement (such as on The LastPicture Show), the original version should be included because THAT'S the one that won theOscars ad the acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink YMCA, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not about trying to duplicate the 70s (or 60s)experience by watching a show only on the sort of TV people would have originallyseen it on.

"It's A Wonderful Life", which we color produced for Paramount Pictures last yearwas considered an extremely successful Holiday release. (FYI: as with all current colorized releases,the fully restored black and white version is always included with the color version.) This HolidaySeason we expect Universal's new color release of the Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire classic, "HolidayInn" will also find a very enthusiastic audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looks stunning in color and certaily enhances thesinging and dance numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael, regarding Star Trek...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suggest (only a suggestion mind you) sit back and enjoy it for what it is... pure entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michale32086 See Profile I'm a Fan of Michale32086 permalink {{{{{{{{{{{Michael, regarding Star Trek...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suggest (only a suggestion mind you) sit back and enjoy it forwhat it is... pure entertainment.}}}}}}}}}}}} WHAT!!!!

So while I generally, let me repeat that, generally, love original works and think they should be left alone there are a few exceptions and this is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have BOTH versions and I like the newerversion better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you go to Startrek.com they give a whole rundown of what was done and what they left alone for a variety of reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I LOVED Lonesome Dove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well done westerns are a thing of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silverado is another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quigley Down UnderA few others as well but those three come to mind first.Hughes movies were great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Never watched Quigley Down Under; I'll check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Messing with a work of art, especially when the driving creative force is gone is highly suspect to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you said somthingnotable: you have BOTH versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the new DVD set let you choose classic originalor souped up new edition, I would have (little to) no objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when you can buy theentire series and that new version is ALL you can get, they're erasing the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon, youwon't be able to buy the original versions without paying top dollar for a used set on eBay.And the look I want isn't "retro," It's the way the series always has looked, just likeCasablanca was always in black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thanks for reading, and glad as a real fan youalso bought the original version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LiberalBuzz See Profile I'm a Fan of LiberalBuzz permalink Hi Michael, Thanks for being the only blogger who talks to his posters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought you might find this interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A good friend of mine worked for Majel Roddenberry and I remember a conversation I had with him regarding the changes which we both liked and he is a real fan of the show. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I gave him a holler today and he said that Gene had vacillated between wanting to update the effects with his blessing and keeping the purist Trekkershappy because he figured they would scream the loudest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he saw thedifference with the new movies he was immediately taken with the idea of doing justthat, but just wasn't sure because of the hard core fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All WernerPatels See Profile I'm a Fan of WernerPatels permalink I have not seen this new revamped DVD version, but my general opinion is, "Why not?" For those who enjoy seeing the original for the umpteenth time, there are always reruns on TV as well as previous DVD sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we shouldn't forget the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who have not joined the world of trekkers yet Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:03 PM on 08/10/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:50 AM on 08/10/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:34 AM on 08/10/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:59 AM on 08/11/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: Leave Star Trek Alone! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-leave-emstar-trekem_b_117937.html [4/5/2009 1:47:16 PM] may be tempted to do so after seeing the original series through the eyes of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, it really shouldn't be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not as if the original version was destroyed, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink In a way, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original version won't be shown on TV (they didn't spend all this money to hide these new editions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, older DVD sets will go out of print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only way to buy theorginal version will be to spend huge amounts of money on used sets sold on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theseries has attracted a rabid following for four decades WITHOUT souping up the specal effects or adding scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why feel the need to do it now? But most importantly, it would be very easy to make both versions available on one set, with viewers choosing between the"classic" and "New Coke" editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I say, why not do that? sino53 See Profile I'm a Fan of sino53 permalink What's controversial about the remastered episodes is that the SFX artists changed the choreographyof the scenes, not just enhancing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, in the famous episode "The Doomsday Machine," the starship Enterprise is now swooping and zooming all around the screen like an X-wing fighter from "Star Wars," or like a target in some video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is such a departure from the original version that it takes some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the the stone bridge, that SFX scene replaced an original live action scene that has now just been discarded altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can preview some of the upgrades on YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EDTrLjsRk4 Which episodes do you recognize from these clips?
