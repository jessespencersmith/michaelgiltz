That's how desperate he and others are to distance themselves from the only bum among them to tell the truth. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire used steroids because he was injured and in a slump -- This is the same argument Andy Pettitte and others have used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just did it to recover from an injury, which isn't really cheating, MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2BIG NEWS: NBA | NFL | College Football | Hockey | Creative Minds 2011 | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't Miss Tonight's Rare Full Moon Eclipse Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Passes Senate Procedural Vote Sarah Palin Jabs Michelle Obama's Anti-Obesity Campaign Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our Time Timothy Karr Obama FCC Caves on Net Neutrality -- Tuesday...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: 10 Things We've Accidentally Learned From Crime Dramas PHOTOS: 13 Products Most Likely To Be Made By Child Or Forced Labor John Boehner Strikes Back Against Sarah Palin Amanda Knox Court Makes Crucial Ruling LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Sports Alerts Email Comments 8 Like 38K Like 40K Like 5K Like 11K Like 8K Like 1K Recommend 3K Like 257 except that it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire cheated for a decade and he was just an average player before and a beloved superstar afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This wasn't about weak heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was about lying to kids all over the country and soaking up adoration he didn't deserve and would have never received if he hadn't been a long-term cheat. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire can't remember the names of the illegal drugs he took for a decade -- Really? Every interviewer should have laughed in his face when he said this and said, "For God's sake, get real." This is all part of the denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fewer facts you give out, the fewer facts you're forced to admit, the sooner you can put this all behind you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when McGwire was cheating for a decade and going to sleazy gym rats and back alley dealers, how exactly did he ask for the illegal drugs he was procuring and didn't know the name of? Give me that... stuff? And how often do I inject that... stuff? And what sort of cycleshould I use for that... stuff? And the other... stuff? Really, it's just idiotic and an insult to the idea ofcoming clean to suggest he doesn't even know the drugs he put into his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can't use them properly without knowing what it is you're using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire is lying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire told the New York Times he used extremely low dosages because he didn't want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Lou Ferrigno -- See, he was using low dosages so it wasn't really cheating anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the guy nicknamed Popeye, the guy whose arms were the size of a Little Leaguer actually thinks he DIDN'T look like the Hulk? Try looking at some photos, McGwire. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire made a fool of himself in front of Congress to protect his family and friends -- See, it wasn't his own diminished reputation he was protecting, it wasn't his own sad lack of character, it wasn't his own fading chance at the Hall of Fame that forced McGwire to not tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was merely his desire to protect his family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How noble of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Except it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His family and friendswere defending him to the world, standing by him, believing him and he made fools of them and theMaris family and everyone else, not just himself. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire insisted no family member had ever DIRECTLY asked if he had used steroids -- This is the saddest lie of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His family and friends, his father and children, took McGwire at his word and believed him when he told the world he wasn't a cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And McGwire is hiding behind a Clintonian parsing of words to suggest he never lied to them either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your family shouldn't have to cross-examine youto get the truth, McGwire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every day in every way, they demonstrated their faith in him and their belief that the accusations against him were lies and jealousy, not fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGwire lied to them every day in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUD SELIG'S CONTINUED LIES 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selig referred to the "so-called steroid era" -- There's nothing so-called about it, Selig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least, AT LEAST 30% of all major league baseball players were breaking federal law, cheating their opponents, cheating their teammates and cheating themselves by using steroids and HGH and other illegal drugs.When one out of every three players is shooting up literally or figuratively, there's nothing "so-called" about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like to call it the Selig Steroid Era, just to make clear the players were working hand in hand with owners who looked the other way while all this was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selig's refusal to face facts even now isEXACTLY why the steroid era happened in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of the biggest stars of the era have beenouted as pathetic cheats: Roger Clemens, the biggest pitcher of the era; Mark McGwire, the biggest home run basher of the era; and Alex Rodrigues, the biggest hitter and over-all talent of the era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In what fantasy world can all the big names be cheats but it's wrong to refer to their time as the Selig SteroidEra? 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selig said the steroid era is over -- As long as baseball insists on policing itself and refuses to let an outside agency handle the testing, as long as baseball refuses to employ Olympic-level standards, as long as baseball allows cheats like Mark McGwire to work for major league teams, as long as cheats like Alex Rodriguez and so many others can break federal law and thumb their noses at the idea of decencyand fair play yet be treated as admirable, as long as these people clearly fess up to the minimum amountof facts and avoid telling the whole truth, the steroid era will be with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And steroids and Selig will be forever linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worst commissioner in baseball history -- if you care about the game as opposed to quarterly profits -- continues to shame himself with out and out lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like his favorite players. --30-- Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

How about the NFL and its commission er.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Bellichek and the New England Patriots were caught cheating and the league destroyed evidence and swept the whole matter under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A cheat is a cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bring back honor and dignity, true values, doing the right thing, and social disdain for ill gotten gains.This 'get yours' philosophy is out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should always come with caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This applies to Government , and also applies to Mark McGwire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree violently with everything said here, especially the tone of the piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's about time someone called out these so-called athletes for what they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mediocre players and great cheaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like the naming of this era as the Selig Steroid Era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selig okayed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He approved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If not literally, then tacitly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take a look at one player who defines the steroid era better than any other player:Brady Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was a average sized center fielder in the early nineties, and had never hitmore than 21 home runs in a season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was over 10 full years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then in spring training in 1996something changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brady looked like an NFL linebacker , with a neck the size of my thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He proceeded to hit 50 (yes fifty!!!) home runs that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the numbers trailed off later in hiscareer, it was obvious to anyone with basic logic that Anderson was all jacked up on steroids.There's absolutely nothing else that could account for this average player's sudden size and suddenpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's all stop acting like children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's stop eating the propaganda pumped out by MLB and their army of lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stop acting like children and use the basic logic you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, most of MLBs players used steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it gave them immense power numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, they cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, they lied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the average beer-swill ing sports fan should grow up and act like an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Accept the truth and stop the lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON TWITTER NBA Video Poverty Health 30 Rock Immigration Death &amp; Dying Islam Christianity Enter Keyword(s): Enter a City: Select a State: â€“ All United States â€“ Select a Category: â€“ All Job Categories â€“ HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â»Recency | Popularity fedupinpa 01:16 PM on 1/13/2010 Permalink | Share it Orwellian 05:57 PM on 1/12/2010 Permalink | Share it Master-T 04:24 PM on 1/12/2010LISTEN: Dennis Rodman Received Oral Sex During Radio Interview 161 Comments Arrest Warrant Issued For Floyd Mayweather 112 Comments Comments are closed for this entry View All 789 Fans 298 Fans 59 Fans 0 Fans 91 FansAmerican sports is a hotbed of cheating and hypocrisy at every level starting with high school so I do not expect major league baseball be any different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I disagree violently with much of what's said here, most especially the tone of what's said, as if the author had some God-given right to baseball purity that those evil athletes denied him, but I doagree about one thing: Bud Selig is the worst commisione r in baseball's long and tumultuous history, a self-servi ng mediocrity who applauded every homerun hit by every swollen-ar med slugger in every ballpark the year after the strike, and now would tell us he's shocked, shocked to discoverthere is gambling at Rick's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I appreciate your agreement about Bud Selig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My tone is incredulou s because I can't believe these major news outlets are allowing McGwire to clearly lie and obfuscate whenpretending to "come clean." (He doesn't know the names of the drugs he took for adecade? Please.) But it's not holier than thou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just basic decency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm no saint, but ifyou and I played tennis or poker, I'd expect you to get pretty angry if I cheated you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isn'tthat natural? It's just a game, but a game isn't fun without rules that everyone follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthe more talented you are, the sadder it is for you to cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I was playing one on onewith Michael Jordan, wouldn't it be pretty sad if he intentiona lly double dribbled to get around me? Wouldn't you say, Michael, really? Wouldn't it be sad if Roger Federer called aball out he knew was good? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone makes mistakes but these guys brokethe law and intentiona lly cheated for months and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not some slip-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Continuous , intentiona l cheating deserves to be treated with scorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any kid playing stickball in an empty lot knows that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only that, but it seems to me that McGwire is going to skate right by thesavagery that Barry Bonds was subject to for the very same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, didn't Martha Stewart and a couple of others do time for lying to the feds? You "disagree violently" ? Roid Rage perhaps?
