(Or the digital download of the year, if you prefer your music in ones and twos.) Sal Nunziato gave his typically rambling, insightful, personal review of a tremendous concert featuringWolf and Bettye LaVette in NYC in late May that made you feel like you'd actually been there. (He doesn't review concerts so much as recreate the feeling he had while attending them.) That appeared on his ownwebsite, but he's such a HuffPost regular it counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I even gave a shout out to the CD in an unconnected post about another great CD of the year from Sharon Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why not? It's easily one of the most entertaining, wildly raucous and just plain exciting albums of 2010. (Wolf was a key member of the J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geils Band and for some reason his solo work has never gained as much attention as that group -- God knows why.) I was gutted to miss that concert with Wolf and LaVette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I have been catching him on TV, where Wolf has been incredibly captivating. (Have I used enough positive adverbs for you yet? Buy the CD) Here he is on David Letterman's show singing "I Don't Wanna Know."
