                <p>Tom Hanks in his most difficult role yet: director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Below: A scene from That Thing You Do! Hanks plays the manager of a rock band called The Wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL GILTZ o what does a superstar do for an encore after he's won two back-to-back Oscars, received every acco­ lade, and is among the most sought-after leading men in Hollywood-all by age 40? If you're Tom Hanks, you ·climb "onto the back of a flatbed train that's going 60 miles an hour." Figuratively, not literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's how the celebrated actor describes directing his first feature film, That Thing You Dol, at the breakneck sprint of "full-tilt boogie." The movie, a dramatic comedy set in 1964, is about an Erie, Pennsyl~ania, rock band called The Videography Toy Story (1995) Available On Video October 29 The Celluloid Closet (1995) Apollo 13 (1995) Forrest Gump (1994) Philadelphia (1993) Sleepless in Seattle (1993) Fallen Angels-Volume 2 (1993) A League ofTheir Own (1992) Radio Flyer (uncredited) (1992) Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) The 'Burbs (1989) Turner &amp;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hooch (1989) , .. j, J Punchline (1988) Big (1988) Dragnet (1987) Nothing in Common (1986) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Money Pit (1986) Every Time We Say Goodbye (1986) The Man with One Red Shoe (1985) Volunteers (1985) Splash (1984) Bachelor Party (1984) Mazes and Monsters (1982) He Knows You're Alone (1980) Wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their signature song soars on the charts and sends its four young musician s on a personal and professional jour­ ney from spaghetti joints to stardom. "You're hurtling from one station to the next because of all the things that have to be done," says Hanks. "We opened production offices in July '95, and I've been working full­ time-24 hours a day, seven days a week-ever since." Not that he's complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After his string of successful rums-A League of Their Own, Sleepless in Seattie, Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Toy Story-Hank s could have chosen to sit quietly at home reading scripts, readying for another role, or reliving his Academy Award moments .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But which script? Which role? Just how do you top success? "There was the requisite amount of depression after Apollo 13," Hanks admits. "Creatively, I needed something new." It was Philadelphia director Jonathan Demme who put the idea of directing in Hanks's head. "I was with Jonathan in New York, and we were talking about my doing this role or that, and he said, 'You know, the coolest thing you could do continued 011 page 25 17 " r HANKS continued from page 17 now is say, Forget it; I want to direct.' And I said, 'You're right.''' So Hanks joined a growing list of celebrated actors fortunate enough to peak before their first gray hair, like Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood, and Warren Beatty, who all turned to directing not just for a new challenge but also for the thrill of that heart-racing, fear-provoking "first­ time" feeling. "I ended up directing this thing because it was the most bodacious thing to do," Hanks explains. "There wasn't a single moment on the movie that my experiences as an actor prepared me for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not the first read-through, not the first day of shooting, not any big scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't have time to celebrate any sort of achievement because the clock is running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You do not get so much as a nanosecond to say, 'okay, let me sit back and enjoy the vista.'" Though he's legendary for his laid-back manner on-and offscreen, Hanks kept a more frenetic pace for this film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only did he direct, he also conceived the story, penned the screenplay, and cowrote some of the original songs on the soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the movie's subject matter, it would be natural to assume that Hanks, like many baby boomers, once had a garage band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's not a trained musician (though he did take up the guitar on the set of Turner &amp; Hooch on the advice of costar Mare Winningham so he'd "always have something to do" in his trailer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, he'd always regarded rock stars with awe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What fascinated Hanks even more were movies about guys in bands, most notably Richard Lester's two Beatles classics, Help! and A Hard Day's Night, and John Boorman' s Having a Wild Weekend, with the Dave Clark Five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two of his other favorites were the Talking Heads concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Demme, and the comedy about Beatles fans, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, by Robert Zemeckis, Hanks's director on Forrest Gump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it wasn't until he saw Alan Parker's The Commitments, chronicling the make-or-break struggles of a young Irish band, that Hanks thought about an American version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initially, he was worried that doing a '60s period musical came loaded with perils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his view, too many were "just a bad version of Elvis Presley movies." He decided to first try his hand at a screen­ play and "write something that was rel­ atively familiar, yet had all sorts of new stuff in it." In 1994, he fleshed out an idea that had been "percolating for some time" into a nine-page outline. "Work­ ing on the screenplay was a test to see if I had the concentration, and the stom­ ach, to start on page one and continue on to page 121," Hanks recalls. "I was waiting for it to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On page seven? Page 27? Page 67? It took three months to do a cohesive draft that sort of worked." Hanks also wasn't sure if he want­ ed to direct-or if he could. "For years, I wouldn't have considered myself qual­ ified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't have the social skills, the business acumen, or the ability to com­ municate that is necessary," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor, until recently, the Hollywood clout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back in 1990, Hanks's career, which had sparked with the 1984 sleeper Splash, almost went up in smoke because of The Bonfire of the Vanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That movie was ripped apart by critics and audiences; a book was even written about its many missteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After that debacle, Hanks fired his handlers and hired the town's most powerful talent agency, CAA, to rescue him from the brink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the moment Forrest Gump passed the $300 million mark at the box office in 1995, Hanks had carte blanche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he brought his screenplay to 20th Century Fox, where he had a first-look deal, execu­ tives gave him the green light to direct. "A guy like me directing his first movie is going to garner attention," Hanks admits. "So the question was, Are we going to do this right? Or are we going to do this in a cheap, incred­ ibly abbreviated way? That was the stu­ dio's call." But to create the right look (he once had driven through Erie and • thought it was a cool town) and feel (the summer of '64 was "modern enough, goofy enough, and yet removed enough, and the music is still pretty good") of the place, the actor asked for $25 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Oscars helped him get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hanks cast four unknowns as the male leads-Tom Everett Scott, Jon­ athon Schaech, Steve Zahn, and Ethan Embry-and Liv Tyler as the female lead without knowing she would steal the thunder from the other cast mem­ bers of Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty ("Hey, I just thought I was cast­ ing that girl in the Aerosmith video").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also offered parts to Rita Wilson, his wife, and Peter Scolari, his co-star on the 1980-1982 TV series Bosom Buddies, which had catapulted Hanks from a col­ lege drama major and New York stage actor to network comedy star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Hanks cast himself as Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; White, a cynical-about- show-business record executive for Play tone Records who signs The Wonders to his label. "The role doesn't require a huge amount of emoting-it's not like his dog dies or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was nice to impact scenes," Hanks says. "There were times when I was directing and I'd think, 'Man, it'd be fun to be an actor in this movie.' \Vhen I got to be an actor, it was fun." As for the directing experience, Hanks calls it "constant crisis manage­ ment." Aware that he was working with young, inexperienced actors, Hanks tried to create a "no pressure, open set" where they wouldn't be afraid to experiment. "The thing I always tried to say is that you cannot do wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worst thing that will happen is we won't use the take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one's going to get punished." He credits those who've directed him­ Demme, Zemeckis, Ron Howard, Nora Ephron, Penny Marshall, some of the best in the business-with teaching him that "there's no one way to do anything." The only thing Hanks did insist on is that his actors were prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He made his cast watch a lot of Shindig and Hullabalo o, TV programs from the early '60s, to pick up the way people talked and carried themselves during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the music scenes, Hanks says, "We were going for that energy and excitement, but also simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're watching these guys perform and that's the hallmark." continued 017 page JO 25 HANKS continued/ rom page 25 Hanks's song-writing ability will be hard to judge since what he wrote for the film was supposed to be "cheesy." For the "good" songs, I-Ianks wanted original music, and he and producer Gary Getzman sifted through about 400 submissions before selecting two Nashville tunesmith s to write the bulk of the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only after the movie was edited to a 2'l:-hour rough cut did Hanks feel bold enough to invite his close friends to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the first time he showed it to an audience, in Phoenix, it was "a bona fide surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was anticipating, 'Oh my god, it's a screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll have to throw up in the car on the way to the theater.' But I couldn't wait to see what they were going to tell me!" \Vanting an "llO~est reaction" to his film, he sneaked into the theater once the lights went down. "It's a problem when you're a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nobody knows who you are, you can sit back and it's no big dcal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if the crowd knows you're there, which most of them prob­ ably did, it's going to affect the process." ~atu rally, Hollywood is holding its breath, waiting to sec how the film is recei\·ed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hanks's ncxt possible project may be as an actor-in the World War II drama Saving Private Ryall, a joint effort by Paramount/Dreamworks SKG. which hc might make with direc­ tor Stcven Spielberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether he'd consider directing again, Hanks responds, "I f the opportunity comes, I'll look forward to it because I'll know better what to worry about and what not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll know where I can truly man­ age and where I'd be wasting my time trying to micromanage .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd know how to shoot things better, too. "But in all honesty, it would be hard to have any enthusiasm to direct again if this movie tanks because .1 like the way it came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I'm so totally wrong, well, theil, you know what? I had a pretty good movie star gig going, and I ought to stick with that." 0 Michael Giltz has written about movies for Premiere, Out, and other magaz1l1cs. 30</p>
