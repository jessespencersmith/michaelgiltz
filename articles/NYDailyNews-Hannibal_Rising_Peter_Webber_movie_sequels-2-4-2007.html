                <p>"For a f,lmmaker, it mems you cm come along and approach it in your om way," says Webber 'You're not as hemed in when you do the origin story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe prequels give you more freedom than sequels." HIRE A GOOD DIRECIOR That might seem obvious, but when you're dealing with a massive fran- chise with merchandising and tie-ins and all sorts of massive expectations, the last thing on anyone's list is creativ- itSr or frlmmaking vision Often, HolJy- wood thinks delivering expected results is more important than the people who make the movie Big mistake "Hiring Christopher Nolil to do'Bat- mm Begins' was inspired," says fllm historian and critic Leonard Maltin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nolan, an Englishman who'd made the critical fave "Memento" (2000), "brougbt an adult sensibility to the properry and a great eye for casting," says Maltin Other examples include Alfonso Cuar6n ("Y Tu Mama Tambien." the new "Children of Men") taking on the third Hogwarts adventure, 2004's "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azk- aban"; Ridley Scott doing 2001's "Han- nibal," and Len Wiseman ("Under- world') rackling the upcoming "Live Free or Die Hard-" Certainly Webber, whose main credit is an art-house hit about a 17th century painter, isn't the obvious choice for "Hmnibal Rising " "For a start, it's on a much bigger scale, it's much more epic," says Web- ber aboutwhy he agreed to do it "And there's a great World Wil Il battle at the beginning For me, it was a chmge of pace - something quite different, and, frankly, I wanted to flex my muscles and show that I could do something else " RKAST THE IEAD This is inevitable for a series like the Jmes Bond films, which bas been ac- tive for decades "Obviously. they got so much buzz about Daniel Craig," says Maltin lt's also worked tor Baf - man reven before Christian Bale wore the cowl in "Begins," the Dilk Knight was played post-Michael Keaton by Val Kilmer and George Clooney), as well as coundess other franchises dating back to the 1930s and '40s Some roles. of course, ue wedded to a particular ac-tor But if there's money to be made md enough tirne hm passed, those franchis- es can be restarted Is "Die Hard" un- thinkable without Bruce Willis? Today, yes T\ryenty years from now? We'll see GET SERIOUS That's what they did with Batman, thanks to Tim Burton's 1989 film that washed away memories of the '60s -Iv show (and Nolan's film. which buried the kitsch of Joel Schumacher's two Bat-flicks) And it was the tuel behind "Supeman Retulns, ' which ignored the broad, almost silly, final two movies with Christopher Reeve (and the Harle- quin romance feel of "Lois &amp; Clark" md teen angst of "Smallville," both on'lV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sylvester Stallone did the same with the recent "Rocky Balboa," which returned the Philly fighter to his gritty roots And that's, of course, what they did with Bond. which scored the trifecta of re- casting the lead, telling the origin story ond getting serieus "They took a series that had turned outlandish and made it solid and viable again," savs Maltin of Bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THINI( (ROSSOVTRS AND SPINOFFS These are sometimes the sisn of a desperatefranchise "Alienvs Preda- tor" and "Freddy vs Jason" are recent exmples that made an impact, and therr precursors are such 1940s flicks as "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" md "Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Franken- stein " Then there are spinoffs like the upcoming '\polverine," which makes sense since "X-Men" has run its course with the curent story line (md Hugh Jackman was that series' breakout star) And "Scary Movie" hro proven re- markably durable by spinning off titles Iike "Date Movie" and last weekend's No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I fiim, "Epic Movie " WAIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JUSTWAIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the suresl way to reenergEe a movie series is simply to let it rest for a while Stallone found that time made people forget 1 990's "Rockj/ \r' and re- member the chtracter they loved Anq it's been so long since a successful live- action Tazan movie has been made that rumors of director Guillermo del Toro ("Pan's lab)nnth') tackling the senes cm get fatr excited all over again As Maltin says, "I would love to see that " ahen "Hannibal Rising" opens Friday, it will be the fifth film in a franchise that has already grossed more than $800 million worldwide at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it'll be yet another example of Hollywood's ongoing Iove for a successful movle senes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year will see second sequels to srrch titles as "Shrek," "Spider-Man," "Pirates of the Cilibbean" and "Rush Hour." There'll be a second "Fantastic Foun" And there'11 be the latest install- ment of the Harry Potter films, the third entry in the "Ocean's Eleven" racket and a fourth "Saw" slasher flick (lhis comes off last fall's megasuccessful iames Bond reboot. "Casino Roy'ale." and Iast summer's semi-successful "Su- peman Returns ") Trying to reenergbe an old senes will be a new "Die Hard" actioner and a revamped "Halloween " And trying to launch a new frmchise will be the live- actiory'CGI "Transfomers"; "Nmcy Drew.' the original girl delecrive; and "The Golden Compass," the first mov- ie from the best-selling book series "His Dark Materials " And 2008 could bring the exDected return of both IndimaJones and "Beverly Hitls Cop " In other words, frmchises are big business, and keeping them going is Hollyvood's most important task Here's how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIART TRO1'| IHE BEGINNING One key way to reenergize a fran- chise is to retum to its roots and tell the "oiigin" story Even if it's been told be- . fore, that's a sure way to get fans inter- ested again It worked for 2005's "Bat- man Begins" and the 2006 model Jmes Bond Clearly, the folks behind the Han- nibal Lecter films hope it works for them, too For "Flamiba.l" director Peter Web- ber ("Girl Wlth a Pearl Earring"), the chmce to tell the origins of everyone's favorite camibal-esthete was irresist- ible And, he admits, in some ways, cre- atively easiero z, I zoE -E o{ o3 F zEUI C to o Noo</p>
