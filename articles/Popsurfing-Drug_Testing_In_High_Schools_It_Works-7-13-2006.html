                <p>T H U R S D AY, J U LY 1 3 , 2 0 0 6Drug Testing In High Schools: It Works!Yeah, so does locking up kids in their room after you pick them up fromschool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't mean it's a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA Today talks about thegrowing trend of random drug testing for kids in high school (Pushedaggressively by Bush) -- you know, testing trouble-makers who want toplay a sport, go to a dance or drive their car to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Treating kids likecriminals for no good reason is stupid on so many levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dumbestproponent is this New Jersey principal who says the first year they didtesting she sampled 10% of the students...and found one drug user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thenext year she did 25% of the kids and found none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Success! Uh,shouldn't finding ONE kid show the waste and stupidty of testing oneout of every four students and teaching them Big Brother thinks they'reguilty before innocent? Plus, the ONE thing schools might want to lookfor are athletes pressured into using steroids and other drugs that canhurt and kill them -- we all know the pressure to succeed at the highschool level for a kid wanting to go to college or just not let down hisfamily and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But almost none of the schools actually test athletesfor steroids because that increases the cost of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They test forcocaine and marijuana -- and as many studies have shown, kids takingpart in athletics are less likely to do those drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stupid all around.Common sense dictates they'd be far better off focusing on studentswho showed warning signs -- driving erratically, dramatic changes ingrades or behavior, athletes who suddenly gain 15 pounds in muscleand have acne all over their back, and so on -- rather than treating allkids like criminals.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 8:00 AM 2 C O M M E N T S :priv8pete said...Back when I was in high school we used to do lines of blow off thecheerleader's chests during halftime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government has really takenall the fun out of being a kid!3:13 PM Michael in New York said...Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Drug Testing In High Schools: It Works!http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/07/drug-testing-in-high-sc... 1 of 37/29/09 12:08 AMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SBiboyMichael in New YorkAaron POPSURFING.COM: Drug Testing In High Schools: It Works!http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/07/drug-testing-in-high-sc... 2 of 37/29/09 12:08 AMPOPSURFING.COM: Drug Testing In High Schools: It Works!http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/07/drug-testing-in-high-sc... 3 of 37/29/09 12:08 AM</p>
