Next came Colson Whitehead's upcoming novel "Underground Railroad,"which is scrupulously accurate and believable about life as a slave..until the Underground Railroad is revealed to be aShare This Book About The Author Ben Winters MoreBen H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winters is the author of, most recently, World of Trouble, the concluding book in the Last Policeman trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second book, Countdown City, was an NPR Best Book of 2013 and the winner of thePhilip K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick Award for DistinguishedScience Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Last Policeman â€¦was the recipient of the 2012 Edgar Award fromthe Mystery Writers of America; it was also named one of the Best Books of 2012 by Amazon.com and Slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $26.00 (Hardcover) Published: July 05, 2016 Publisher: Mulholland Books Pages: 336 ISBN 10: 0316261246 ISBN 13: 9780316261241literal underground railroad and our reality is upended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the slightest shift in reality, Whitehead condenses the next 140 years of Jim Crow and eugenics and the KKK and systemic brutality, making it shockingly real and surprising all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now here comes Ben Winters' "Underground Airlines." It presents an alternate reality novel, a US in which four states held onto slaves in a great compromise after Lincoln was assassinated before taking office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The time istoday and our hero is a slave catcher, a black man with a chip in his spine that makes him the toy and tool of thegovernment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's forced to hunt down escaped slaves because anything -- anything -- is preferable to returning to thatnightmarish world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winters' novel is fresh and well-thought out and gripping as we wonder if our hero can actually be a hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It stumbles a tad toward the end when Winters reveals an even deeper conspiracy; like Hitchcock always suggested, the vaguer one is about the MacGuffin, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To this sci-fi buff, the "reveal" seemed banal and not terribly convincing.But that doesn't discount the way he creates an anti-hero we fully empathize with, not to mention a world so littledifferent from our own that you wonder if it's different at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And surely that was the point. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "This one kept me up at night and changed the way I saw the world once I was finished."Ã¢ Ann Patchett , Time - "Chilling"Ã¢ Alexandra Alter , New York Times - "Underground Airlines is a masterful work of art with a gripping mystery at its most basic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also a complex allegory woven throughout with sparking rich dialogue and multiple shades of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Passengers, fasten your seat belts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ride may be turbulent, but that's what makes it great."Ã¢ Jen Forbus , Christian Science Monitor - "[A] striking work of speculative fiction . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winters creates a powerful and timely ethical framework for his fast-moving new thriller."Ã¢ Jane Ciabattari , BBC - "Winters reels readers in with details . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The writing leaves the realm of noir and becomes almost lyrical. . . .Underground Airlines will start a lot of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot."Ã¢ Bethanne Patrick , NPR - "Astonishing . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A timely novel focusing on race and equality . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winters handles the controversial topicâ€¦ More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us Â©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
