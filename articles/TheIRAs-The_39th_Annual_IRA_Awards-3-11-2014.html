                <p>Newer Post Older PostTUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014 The IRAs 2013: "Laurence Anyways," "Her," "Fill The Void" Are Big Winner s THE 39TH ANNUAL IRA FILM AWARDS THE BEST MOVIES OF 2013 BEST PICTURE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laurence Anyways – 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her – 20 pts. 3. (tie) Fill The Void – 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stories We Tell – 12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hunt – 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DIRECTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xavier Dolan for Laurence Anyways and I Killed My Mother – 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spike Jonze for Her – 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Polley for Stories We Tell – 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rama Burshtein for Fill The Void – 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas Vinterberg for The Hunt – 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Dolan's first film I Killed My Mother had its world premiere at Cannes in May of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He released a second film -- Heartbeats aka Les Amours Imaginaires -- in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heartbeats only opened commercially in the US in 2011 while both I Killed My Mother and Laurence Anyways had their commercial release in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Films are officially eligible for the IRAs when they first have at least a one-week commercial run in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence both his first and third film were on the list of IRA-eligible films this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joaquin Phoenix for Her – 32 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leonardo DiCaprio for The Wolf Of Wall Street – 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Melvil Poupaud f or Laurence Anyways – 18 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mads Mikkelsen for The Hunt – 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tony Servillo for The Great Beauty – 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: There is a tendency at the IRAs to move beyond whatever movies have received every award in sight -- what's the point, when we can shine a light on something else. (Don't get me wrong; most Oscar nominees and winners don't have much of a chance at the IRAs.) But some performances are so great, they banish such hair-splitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joaquin Phoenix's was so widely admired by the IRAnians that it would have triumphed no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only astonishment is that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.) BEST ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hadas Yaron for Fill The Void – 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suzanne Clement for Laurence Anyways – 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brie Larson for Short Term 12 – 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine – 8 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne Dorval for I Killed My Mother – 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The general consensus among IRA voters was that it was a banner year for female roles (and directors!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone was bursting with options in all acting categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel Bruhl for The Fifth Estate and Rush – 17 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Gandolfini for Enough Said – 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Javier Bardem for To The Wonder – 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yiftach Klein for Fill The Void – 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jonah Hill for The Wolf Of Wall Street – 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nathalie Baye for Laurence Anyways – 17 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anamaria Marinca for Europa Report – 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Razia Israeli for Fill The Void – 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ahd for Wadjda – 11 pts. 5. (tie) Amy Adams for Her – 7 pts. and Jennifer Lawrence for American Hustle – 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCREENPLAY Sarah Polley for Stories We Tell – 14 pts. (first two ballot winners rescinded) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spike Jonze for Her – 17 pts. -- RESCINDED 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xavier Dolan for Laurence Anyways – 16 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RESCINDED 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Polley for Stories We Tell – 14 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Linklater &amp; Julie Delpy &amp; Ethan Hawke for Before Midnight – 13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope for Philomena – 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Here's a quirk of the IRAs that probably holds true for many small voting bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To avoid a second-option from winning by default (it's better to have a passionate choice rather than a mild consensus one), when a winner is announced an offer to Rescind is immediately made and must be voted affirmatively by a majority of the voters present to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why rescind the award from a film that won the most points on first ballot? Maybe people were wary of a sweep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe tactical voters saw their second or third choice tantalizingly close to victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Her was in fact my favorite film (and screenplay) of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I voted to rescind on the gamble of making history and giving best screenplay to a documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others voted to rescind because their favorite film of the year was Laurence Anyways and they hoped success would remain with the runner-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Her was rescinded but those who were annoyed by Her being rejected (and perhaps sensing a major sweep for the very popular Laurence Anyways ) and those like me who were championing Stories We Tell voted to rescind THAT and then the majority confirmed the award would forever go to the Sarah Polley documentary. (Every documentary has a script, certainly any one with narration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, how to structure the documentary, where to put quotes and so on is more than just an editing choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence the importance of a screenplay for the best documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, see Stories We Tell and you'll understand why it's especially appropriate to become the first documentary to win Best Screenplay at the IRAs.) BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asaf Sudri for Fill The Void – 20 pts. 2. (tie) Hoyte Van Hoytema for Her – 15 pts. and Yves Belanger for Laurence Anyways – 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmanuel Lubezki for Gravity and To The Wonder – 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sergio Armstrong for No – 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; K.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barrett for Her – 22 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne Pritchard for Laurence Anyways – 20 pts. 3. (tie) Michael Bricker for Computer Chess – 14 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bob Shaw for The Wolf Of Wall Street – 14 pts. 5. (tie) Stefania Cella for The Great Beauty – 8 pts. and Jess Gonchor for Inside LLewyn Davis – 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCORE 1. (tie) Alex Ebert for All Is Lost – 18 pts. and Arcade Fire for Her -- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bear McCreary for Europa Report – 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bone Burnett for Inside Llewyn Davis – 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Collie Ryan original songs for Computer Chess – 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Though the category name has not been officially changed, it's been accepted that this award is for the best use of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather than worrying about what was created specifically for the film, what was pre-existing, what we simply hadn't heard yet, etc. it goes simply to the best use of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often that is for the best original score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if it was easy to just slap on some Beethoven or Beatles and the music seemed great and improved the film, every movie would do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not that easy, so the effective and creative use of songs or music that already exist is honored here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan's songs may or may not have been written for Computer Chess, for example, but she wrote and performed them herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burnett of course oversaw a cast performing mostly traditional folk tunes and some era-appropriate folk songs and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST EDITING 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike Munn for Stories We Tell – 17 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Kopit, Craig McKay, Livio Sanchez, Aaron Yanes for Europa Report – 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thelma Schoonmaker for The Wolf Of Wall Street – 13 pts. 4. (tie) Jeff Buchanan, Eric Zumbrunnen for Her -- 9 pts. and Alfonso Cuaron, Mark Sanger for Gravity – 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST COSTUME 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Francois Barbeau, Xavier Dolan for Laurence Anyways – 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey Storm for Her – 17 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Wilkinson for American Hustle – 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandy Powell for The Wolf Of Wall Street – 11 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary Zophres for Inside Llewyn Davis – 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faust – 14 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Trek: Into Darkness – 9 pts 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blue Is The Warmest Color – 8 pts. 4. (tie) Inside Llewyn Davis – 5 pts. and Hannah Arendt – 5 pts. and The Place Beyond The Pines – 5 pts. and The Sweeney – 5 pts. and Springbreakers – 5 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Great Gatsby – 21 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blue Jasmine – 20 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dallas Buyers Club – 17 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kill Your Darlings – 13 pts. 5.
