                <p>=oz oz2oNo sign of distress A!;liF,[:iST":- alk about an understanding fami- ly: Growing up in Hamden, Conn., Tom Kavanagh says his late mom would hear him singing along to the radio and say, 'You can carry a tune!" I-ate4 Kavanagh was studying economics when he left college for rock 'n'roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kavanagh's dad (who had a glam-rock band of his own in the '80s) didn't criticize him; and when Kavana- gh recruited drummer Brandon Rapp to move to Connecticut and tour with his band Signal the Escape, Dad let Rapp move into their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that trust is paying off, with Sig- nal the Escape's catchy first Ef; "These Scars Are Just the Beginning," get- ting airplay eveqrwhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the five guys in the group are eager to return to New York for the first time since earlv 2006 in their touring van, which they;ve dubbed "El Guapo." (fhey play Europa in Brooklyn on Thursday.) Maybe some- day the group - with songs like "Maud- lin," "Exorcism in the ER" and "Bovs Lie" that feature surging choruses and memorable hooks - can quit their jobs. "Me and Brandon work at a Dairy Queen," explains Kavanagh, who turns 24 this month. "Mark [Kovalcek, theband's bassist] works at a video store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam [Sanford, guitarist] has the most adultjob - he details cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ivan [Fial-los, guitaristl doesn't actually have a job, per se.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's gettingpretty good at producing local bands in Connecticut.,' Rising from the ashes of the hard- core band Forgive and Forget, Signal the Escape isn't afraid of strong melo- dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the harsh vocals ofthe ear- ly gigs that shredded Kananagh's throat will soon be a thing of the past, he says. "It's terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hate screaming now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved screaming when I first got into the scene; it sounded bad-ass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I've learned it's not good for me." As long as Kavanagh and Rapp re- member to ask for the time off. thev say their manager at the DQ is pretty cool about music, not tast5r treats, be- ing their priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a tull-length al- bum coming soon and a hope of joining biggertours, they could soon put aside chocolate-dipped ice cream for good. "Our biggest goal is to just be able to go out and play every night," says Kavanagh. "If that pays the bills one day, that'd be great."
