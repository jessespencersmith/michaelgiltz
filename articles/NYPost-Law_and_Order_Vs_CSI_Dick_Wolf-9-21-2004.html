"She really helped us out of a jam because her movie career has taken off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Dennis Farina coming here, I told her, 'I'd really love to have you here [at the start].' I said, 'Please stay here for part of the season.'

"I shouldn't be telling you this," says Wolf, "but I already know what the fifth one is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait to do it."</p>
