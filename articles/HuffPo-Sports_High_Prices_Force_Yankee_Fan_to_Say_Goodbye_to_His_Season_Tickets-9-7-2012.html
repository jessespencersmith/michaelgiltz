                <p>Sports Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Follow New York Yankees , Baseball , New York Yankees Stadium , Sports News 12 7 2 4React Inspiring Funny Typical Scary Outrageous Amazing Infuriating ExtremeHigh Prices Force Yankee Fan to Say Goodbye to His Season Tickets I'm a season ticket holder with the New York Yankees, happily enjoying the best -- and cheapest -- seats in thehouse in the bleachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ticket prices have doubled for those seats in three years and I just got off the phone with the Yankees asking for a few more days to scrapetogether money for the post-season package (which theygraciously granted.) And there in my email box is aheartbreaking letter from a fellow Yankee fan, a fatherwho brought his son to countless games to share the joy of the game, exactly the sort of every-day fan you want to be coming to the Stadium again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hehad to let his season tickets go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the letter he sent out: Dear New York Yankees, My son and I have decided to give up our season tickets to the Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was an obvious decision in many ways, but not an easy one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, my son and I have been sitting together in the bleachers for the past 11 years -- since he was fourteen, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over those years we saw some of the most memorable moments in Yankee history, including the home run in October of 2003 that sent the Yankees to The World Series and their hated rivals, The Boston RedSox, back to Bean Town with mud on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there was the beautiful June evening in 2004 when Derek Jeter dove into the stands to catch a foul ball and end a rally that would have cost them the game and a three game sweep -- again, against their pals from Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This game that I just mentioned isoften featured in Yankees advertising for its highlights, including announcer Michael Kay's exclamation,"Oh My! That is one of the greatest games you will ever see!" Yet, perhaps the most memorable and enjoyable aspect of those seats in the old stadium was that they were relatively inexpensive -- just six bucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The toll at the GW Bridge was three or four bucks andparking was five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So we often went to all three games of a midweek home stand, and thus it became something we just did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The toll at the bridge is now twelve dollars and parking is thirty-four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The seats are now twelve and come with a serious obstructed view of left field; that view is blocked by thecenterfield sports bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The thought that any seat in the house could come with such a serious obstructionis, in itself, an indictment of those who designed the stadium or, more specifically, those who guidedthem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We also had the pleasure to meet and sit with a great bunch of guys, and at least one girl, whom we saw year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Special among them were Gerry and his uncle Pat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've been sitting with them all alongMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Mourdock On Abortion: Pregnancy From Rape Is 'Something God Intended' Was The Whole Donald Trump Announcement A Gigantic, Pointless Bust?
