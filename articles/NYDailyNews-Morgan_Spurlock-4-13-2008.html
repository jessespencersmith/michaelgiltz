Ilespite some cold stare+ most people gig- Where were you most scared? ln AfghanF gled or laughed when you asked them where I stan, when the soldiers guarding you sud- Osama Bin lnden was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, of course, the i denly said,'l.etb go!'and hustled you out tlm is framed as a video-game showdown r of there?

There was a kid who saw the film who was about L9 or 20 years old, who came up to me and said, "l've been thinking about going overseasand traveling abroad, and now after seeing this movie, I'm going to get a passport as soon as I get home." For me, if it makes somebody say, "l'm going to go find out for myself and see whafs out there," great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Gilz.</p>
