(He led the media on an O.J.-like car ride through town, shaking the hands of fans on the street when his car stopped at traffic lights.) Siegfried and Roy are everywhere, thanks to billboards and ads sending encouragement and bestwishes to the erstwhile lovers after that life-threatening accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NBC has a promising new drama that is set on the Strip (“Las Vegas” on Mondays at 9 p.m.), the latest in a recent string of shows doing so, including CSI, The Real World, a reality show about showgirls, and of course, Showgirls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Elton John promised to give Céline a few weeks off here and there by committing to five concerts a week, five weeks a year during the next three years inthe Colosseum, the impressive new venue built just for her. (David LaChappelle will help keep the sequins flying as John’s production designer and director.) But it isn’t exactly a gay old time, even though Vegas switched its ad campaign from family-friendly back to Sin City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When they say "What happens here, stays here," it’s a reference to thestandard naughtiness of a businessman away at a convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On countless street corners you’ll find magazines and fliers touting escort services bursting with women for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And bathrooms are filled with ads from college girls just done with their studies and looking for fun. (What, thecollege boys are rushing off to grad school?) The male strip shows advertised are of the Chippendales variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One show—featuring malestrippers from Australia and called “Thunder From Down Under”—had ads featuring buff shirtless men in the family-friendly, medieval-themed Excalibur hotel that said "What knights do at night"—but I don’t think they meant it the way I took it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can certainly search out gay nightlife, but wander the main casinos (whether at themoderately priced Excalibur, which is a good bargain, especially if you’re bringing the moppets along) and you’ll find yourself spotting the occasional gay person with all the regularity with whichyou’d find one at a Republican convention: They’re there, but they’re not exactly conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Céline and the boys And then there’s Céline, whose concerts are sold-out months in advance and gross more than $2 million a week—not counting the merchandising that must flood out of the Céline Dion store right next to the Colosseum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her crowd was distinctly well-dressed compared to the very casual—evensloppy—standards in the rest of Vegas. (Maybe those tickets peaking at $225 encouraged people to make a night of it.) And the Colosseum had a nicely elegant feel, looking like a more intimate version of Radio City Music Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why settle for elegant when you can have over-the-top? Created by Franco Dragone of Cirque du Soleil, “A New Day…” features around 60 dancers, gymnasts, musicians, and singers on a massive and deep stage that would be the envy of any Broadway house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stairways glide up out ofthe ground just so Céline can walk up them triumphantly for a brief moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trees bloom, massive prop instruments and street lamps float through the air, dancers dance, and at the center FROM THE NEWSSTAND ISSUE Great Expectations Editor's Letter Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President, Here’s Another Thing toChange A-List: Nathan LaneToo Girly to Be Girls?Work It Out Reel Travel Southwest SojournWeHo Without Wheels A Quieter Riot Of Pastors and Politicians And on a Lighter Note The Cult of Grey GardensThe New Annuity My Little Dumpling Back AttackBoot BoysUp in Smoke Showstopping Design The New Kings of the Hill: Brad Kiley Recession?

I don’t know how it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should I sing another one? And she does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One number follows another, with each tune inspiring a production more grand than the one before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During one dizzying moment (a song dedicated to all the parents of the world and all the children of the world, which pretty much covers everyone), Céline sings a song for her sonwhile a massive tree appears in the background, and two workmen floating across stage in midair carry a grand piano between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For one brief moment you’d swear avant-garde stage director Robert Wilson had turned to making music videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether she’s singing standards like "At Last," a Stevie Wonder classic like "I Wish," the Chryslerad campaign number "I Drove All Night," or that little ditty from Titanic, you forget individual songs and simply soak in the spectacle that certainly delivers a bang for its buck. (Though the one "sexy" number, with male dancers shirtless and writhing on the floor around Céline, is about as steamy as a duet between Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme.) The guys, warming up It’s no particular slam on Céline to say the star of the show is what is billed as the largest indoor LED screen in North America, which fills the entire back of the stage; this state-of-the-art screen is filled with images of stunning clarity and depth throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one number Célineseems to be standing in a massive outdoor Gothic cathedral with a storm-tossed sky roiling in the background; in another she’s in Times Square; in yet another she’s gliding through space with a massive moon looming up close and then fading far, far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point the real Céline is standing onstage left in profile, but a camera is projecting her imageonto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result? She is looming over herself and all the dancers, staring straight out into the audience with such intensity that you have no choice but to focus on the cyber-Céline rather than the life-size one now lost in the shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This screen and the astonishingly convincing scenes it creates are breathtaking: Once thetechnology becomes more affordable, it seems inevitable this will revolutionize theatrical productions on Broadway and the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One giggles to think what Elton John and David LaChappelle will do with it once they get a chance to play with this marvelous new toy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; READER COMMENTS These comments are reproduced as written by visitors to this Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have not been edited for content, grammar, or spelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The viewpoints appearing here are those of the writer, and donot necessarily reflect the opinion or views of advocate.com, The Advocate , or its affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the first to comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUBMIT A COMMENT FOR THIS STORY: *Type your comment here (Required, 1000 characters max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTML formatting andRecession?
