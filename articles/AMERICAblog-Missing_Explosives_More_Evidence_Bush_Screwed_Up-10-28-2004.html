                <p>T H U R S D A Y , O C T O B E R 2 8 , 2 0 0 4Missing Explosives -- More Evidence BushScrewed Upby Michael in New York on 10/28/2004 11:23:00 AMThe New York Times quotes several Iraqis as eyewitnesses to lootingof Al Qaqaa AFTER the US military swept through."The Iraqis described an orgy of theft so extensive that enterprisingresidents rented their trucks to looters," reports the NYT."The accounts make clear that what set off much if not all of thelooting was the arrival and swift departure of American troops, whodid not secure the site after inducing the Iraqi forces to abandon it.""The looting started after the collapse of the regime," said Wathiqal-Dulaimi, a regional security chief, who was based nearby inLatifiya."And even if much of the explosives were removed before the invasion-- and there is NO evidence it was while a lot of circumstantialevidence and direct evidence that it was removed after -- none ofthat would exonerate the Bushies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were told repeatedly that thiswas a highly important site by the IAEA that urged them to secure itand they didn't even KNOW the explosives were missing until morethan a year after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How is that anything butincompetence?A good soldier trying to provide cover fire for Bush:"Col.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Perkins, who commanded the Second Brigade of the ThirdInfantry Division, called it "very highly improbable" that 380 tons ofexplosives could have been trucked out of Al Qaqaa in the weeksafter American troops arrived."Moving that much material, said Colonel Perkins, who spokeWednesday to news agencies and cable television, "would haverequired dozens of heavy trucks and equipment moving along thesame roadways as U.S. combat divisions occupied continually forweeks.""Yeah, well Col.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perkins seems to have forgotten that other scandal --the mising equipment useful for building bombs that was ALSOextremely heavy and would have taken weeks to dismantle and carryaway on large trucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, it's pretty ridiculous that the mediahasn't linked these two stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kerry should say, "This isn't the firsttime Bush has allowed dangerous material to fall into the hands ofthe bad guys...."More from Col.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perkins:"He conceded that some looting of the site had taken place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But achemical engineer who worked at Al Qaqaa and identified himself onlyas Khalid said that once troops left the base itself, people streamed into steal computers and anything else of value from the offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyalso took munitions like artillery shells, he said."Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mezher, the mechanic, said it took the looters about twoweeks to disassemble heavy machinery at the site and carry thatoff after the smaller items were gone."
