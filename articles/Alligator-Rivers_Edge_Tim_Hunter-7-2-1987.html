                <p>·ver's By' Michael Giltz Consider these names: Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves and lone Skye Leitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're not the usual names you see flashi!Jg across a mOllie screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then River's Edge -the film all these people' are involved in -is not your usual movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Tim Hunter is well aware of this .. "I have to admit," he said, "when I first saw the credits I laughed at how unusual so many of the names were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was definite- 1y a bunch of people you weren't used to seeing on marquees ." But with the critical and com­ , mercia! success of River's Edge, se names are popping up more and more frequently .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie launching these people is a stark, darkly funny film that -like Blue Velvet -. leaves no one un­ moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a fresh, realistic portrayal of teen-agers so drugged out they are desensitized to all but the most extreme emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; River'sEdge, is sharp, painful and frequently hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it is the type of movie for which critics drag out the Big Adjectives, adjectives like "con­ trQversial, co.mpelling and shock­ ing." Movie-mavens Siskel and Ebert are not alone in naming River's Edge "one of the best films of the year." .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story they are raving about is related to a real incident that occurred in nOithern lifornta in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A teen-age boy took his girlfriend into the hills and ~u1-.n, ... ' ....... -,.. ... ~._ .~ ____ &lt;~ __ strangled her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later he re~urned to scbool and bragged about what he'd done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When no one believed him, the murderer took groups of his clas­ smates into ~he hills to view the dead body of their friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More and more people found out about the killing, but it wasn't until several days later that someone on the fringes of the group reporteCl it to the authorities .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as Tim Hunter explained in a telephone interview, that inci-' . r the imagination of screenwriter Neif l'1'r,~~~ "Neil only read a contemporary news story on tbe murder, some­ thing everyone read," Hunter said. "He did not research the crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He took what he had read about it and filtered it through some of his own experiences and brougbt a lot of inspiration to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it isn't based in allY a'etailed way (on theactul event)." The end result is something , much more satisfying than any docu-drama could hope to ~.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Samson (Daniel Roebuck) ·kills his girlfriend , Jamie, tbeir buddies seem more confused about how they feel than what they should do -which is no­ tbing. "I cried when that guy died in Brian's Song," a girl says glumly at one pdint: "You'd figure I'd at least be able to cry for someone I . hung around with." Telling dialogue such as that is wbat first attracted Hunter to this project. "The screenplay was very well­ observed and very dispassionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet I had a great· deal of feeling for the cbatacters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; River's Edge is dark, but it has a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was (sympatbetic) anyway to­ ward the people in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people see these' kids as monsters; my feelings toward them are' more complex," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically , Hunter's feelings to­ ward even the idea of doing anotber teen-oriented picture were . complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He first came to prominence with Tex, which . - made a star out of Matt Dillon and turned Hunter into a hot property, He bided his time and finally chose Sylvester as his second directorial effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A girl-and-her-horse movie, Sylvester is notable for being the motion-picture debut of Melissa Gilbert and little else. "I had' an excellent time making Sylvester, I really enjoyed it ... although it was a disaster commercially, " Hunter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollywood is only too eager to . -.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IIJld he s determined not to be tagged a teen director, a Itt-John Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Hunter came across the script to River's Edge, "It knocked me out ... it felt so realistic, and it's a damn good story." That realism. is tempered by a surreal sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of that comic relief is provided by Feck; a local recluse played by Dennis Hopper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is a burnt-out refugee of the '60s who hands out Feck-weed (marijuana) to the loe!! kids that gravitate around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When alone, Peck dances around his house with a blow-up sex doll, which refresents the girl he murdered many-years ago. "I killed a girl once," be says proudly. uNo accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Put a gun to the back of her bead and blew her brains out the front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was in love." "Dennis was great," Hunter says. "The kids idolized him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He brings so much wonderful history with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He and I were really in great agreement about different approaches to the part, and we just had a really good time working together. " Another actor Hunter enjoyed working with was Crispin Glover , who plays Layne, the nominal leader of the teen-agers who is constantly wired on speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glover played Marty McFly, Michael J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox's father in Back To The Fu­ ture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coming hot on the heels of that smash success, Glover's pre­ sence gave River's Edge an extra push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IronicraiJY, ~ny .criticism of t e -,film has 'ceiltere1:l do· his perfor-'\' mance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wh~lethe rest-o. f.J~~~~ are-, -diSatiliift8lY,·: ... ~~ewti Ie, Gl,oye~ is h)'~rkine.tic and .. d~~-I fraught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many ways, he embo-! dies the-film's balance between the I off-beat and the off-putting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter spoke up for him: "I was very happy to have everybody low-key and natural, and Crispin off on his own plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did see the part in comic terms xery spec!.:. fically, and he built a very strongly t lized . cal or ce." Another very stylized momeDt :-gi,!es tbe film wbat may very well be its most striking sequence .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the scene, the killer describes to Feck how he killed his girlfriend .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That vivid monologue is inter­ weaved with shots of two other characters making love, and the result is a creepy, unnerving pass­ age that few in the audience can forget. - , Often, such highlights of a film are udiscovllred" in the cuiting room or improvised by the ciirec­ tor, but HUDter spoke up proudly for the screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said, "That scene was abso-' lutely scripted that way -cut for cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, when Hemdale-{an -_ ..... independent film company agreed to make River's Edge, they were II bit nervous about that scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I felt it was strong and had a classical, timeless feel to it." .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the film is careful not to make moral pronouncements , Peck and a radical teacher at the local high school -both symbols of the '60s -do represent &amp;J-­ conscience of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Hunter does not feel it is making aDy~ comparisons between then and now. " .. don't think River"s·l!dge i~ saying, 'Maybe tb~ '60s were better,'" he said firmly.t'But"how I interpreted the script -which had all those linkages between. the '60s and the '80s -'was that whate~er values people got ex­ cited about in the '6Qs didn't traveJ. very well." : • applause. tillnd., July ~ SI87, a</p>
