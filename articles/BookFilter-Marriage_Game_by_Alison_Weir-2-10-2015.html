Weir chooses to avoid too much calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elizabeth isseen as even tricking herself in a way when it comes to marriage and what she wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This keeps France and Spainand her devoted councillors thoroughly off balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all we have her one true love, Lord Robert Dudley, whowould have her and does...at least her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is kept awaiting for decades, falling in and out of favor as he falls inand out of her bed, where they enjoy the pleasures of the flesh but not the final consummation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel does lag abit in the middle as Elizabeth toys again and again in a repetitive style with one suitor after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if it frustratesthe reader, imagine how it must have frustrated the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always smart, always interesting, Elizabeth is to say theleast enjoyably human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even casual fans of history will know the dramatic finale that blows her way when theSpanish Armada threatens the nation she has proudly kept at peace for decades thanks to Elizabeth's wily dance.The marriage game almost wears out its welcome -- as does "The Marriage Game" -- but when you see howcompletely she has won at the end in terms of history, it would be churlish to deny her success. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for Alison Weir A Dangerous Inheritance “A juicy mix of romance, drama and Tudor history . . . pure bliss for today’s royal watchers.”—Ladies’ Home Journal “Highly compelling [with] plenty to keep readers enthralled.”—Historical Novel Review Captive Queen “Should be savored . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weir wastes no time captivating her audience.”—Seattle Post-Intelligencer “Stunning . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As always, Weir renders the bona fide plot twists of her heroine’s life with all the mastery of a thrillerauthor, marrying historical fact with licentious fiction.”—The Denver Post The Lady Elizabeth “Intrigue and maneuverings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schemers and innocents put to death. [This] history of Tudor England is anengrossing story. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weir marries conjecture with what is known about the life of Elizabeth I from childhood tocoronation, and it makes for ripping good reading.”—Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</p>
