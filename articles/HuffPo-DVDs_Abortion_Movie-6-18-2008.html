(Unlike his new movie, The Love Guru, which is getting brutal reviews.) Popeye The Sailor 1938-1940 ($34.98; Warner Bros.) -- The spinach-loving hero in his heyday, thanks to the quirky talent of the Fleischers and loads of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The less said about the godawful 70s episodes in Popeye &amp; Friends Volume One ($14.98; Warner Bros.) the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Etc. -- Finally, it's impossible to stay on top of everything that comes my way, so here are some titles I still need to check out: the gangster drama Classe Tous Risques ($29.95; Criterion); David Duchovny's welcome dive into TV comedy on Californication First Season ($39.99; Showtime), the airplane favorite Fool's Gold ($28.98; Warner Bros.) -- seriously, the last two plane trips I've beenon it seemed like this Matthew McConaughey no-brainer was practically the only movie anyone watched; Burn Notice Season One ($49.98; Fox), the promising-looking drama about an ex-spy I dipped into but haven't fully absorbed yet; Rails &amp; Ties ($27.98; Warner Bros.), another genuinely indie drama starring Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden, two actors who've proven theirdedication to serious filmmaking again and again; Weeds Season Three ($39.98; Showtime), thecomedy my friend Aaron really enjoys and which I can't seem to catch up with yet; and Jack Black'sBe Kind, Rewind ($27.98; New Line), a commercial flop co-starring Mos Def, an appealing and talented actor who can't seem to pick good movie scripts but has much better luck onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So did you see 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days and did you think it was pro-choice, anti-abortion or neither?
