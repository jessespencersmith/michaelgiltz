(No, the digital copy isn't compatible with iPods, but that will surely change in thefuture.) Imagine if you bought a CD to listen to at home andthen found out you had to buy another copy to listento it in your car, another copy to play on yourcomputer and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd balk, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon,when you buy a movie on DVD from a major studio,you'll be able to download a copy (just like with Harry Potter ) for free so you can watch it on your laptop if you prefer and eventually on any portable device you own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's got to be the wave of the future if studios want to keep customershappy and give them value for their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if only the book industry would wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now, they expect you to buy a book two or three or four times so you can read it in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or you're expected to buy only one versionand be stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine if buying a hardcover book gave you access to a free digital audio Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Are you bored by the idea of seeing the last two now that you know how it ends? And does getting a free digital download version of a movieyou can watch on your laptop seem like a positive step to you?
