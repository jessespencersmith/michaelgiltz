Visual design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This coffee table-worthy book authorized by the Welles estate is burstingwith sketches and drawings and storyboards, the genesis of ideas that would come to fruitionwith work like his groundbreaking voodoo “Macbeth” on stage, the film “Citizen Kane” and athousand other projects both real and only imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From his early childhood fascination withShakespeare to tantalizing glimpses of what might have been, these artistic offerings show aprotean talent free to dream big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if only someone would rescue and reissue the Wellesguide to staging Shakespeare’s plays that he published when barely a lad! Leading MenBy Christopher Castellani $27, Viking It’s safe to say “Tennessee Williams” is not the playwright’s greatest creation: too many of his characters are forever seared into our consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But boy, the colorful Tennessee suregives them a run for their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s no wonder author Christopher Castellani chose to base hisdebut novel on that vivid, larger than life man and perhaps his one true love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would beFrank Merlo, a blue collar guy from New Jersey who served honorably in World War II and thenserved honorably as the right-hand man and devoted partner to a needy but generous giant ofthe theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this acclaimed work, Castellani describes the glamorous but secretive world ofgay men in the 1950s with what the New York Times dubbed almost a Fitzgeraldian glow.Williams and Merlo shared their lives from 1947 (when Williams was already a superstar) to 1963and “Leading Men” captures in full their bittersweet and sexy and sad romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sounds Like Titanic: A MemoirBy Jessica Chiccehito Hindman $25.95, W.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norton Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman had the makings of a nutty, hard-to-believe memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This aspiring violinist made it from the mountains of Appalachia to study classical music at ColumbiaUniversity in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So how did she end up touring with The Composer, a purveyor ofeasy-listening faux-classical music hawked at street fairs and PBS drives around the country?Worse, she never really played the violin on stage; she and other musicians simply mimed aperformance for audiences while a CD played through the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From endless nights eatingat chain restaurants to smiling as fans snatched up one crappy album after another while praising Hindman’s talent, her dream of being a professional violinist had turned into adepressing — but profitable — nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But her professional nadir is just the starting pointhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hindman also jumps back and forth in time, describing in intimate detail her childhoodobsession with the violin, the genuine sacrifices her family made to get her lessons, and how,even at 11 years old, Hindman realized she was good … but not that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hindman turns aone-note joke of a job into a rich and painful look at the drive to succeed in the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She mayhave fallen short as a violinist, but she triumphs as a writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our February Book Of The Month: Read the full review here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staging Musicals: An Essential GuideBy Matthew White $35.95, Methuen Drama Director and writer Matthew White is a major force in UK theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among many notable achievements (a revival of “She Loves Me” at the Menier Chocolate Factory, not to mention“Little Shop of Horrors” in the West End), he co-write and directed the Olivier-winning musical“Top Hat.” Drawing on those years of experience (not to mention his days as an actor), Whitegives theater students, working professionals and fans some genuine insight into how to stage amusical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether you’re an ambitious member of your local community theater, dreaming ofmaking it on Broadway or just want to know more about what goes into creating your favoriteshows, White gives a step by step guide from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genesis Begins AgainBy Alicia Williams $17.99, Atheneum Genesis is the young heroine of this coming of age young adult novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She struggles to see herself in a positive light and that means stepping into the spotlight seems the scariest thing ofall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she can’t celebrate herself, why would anyone else? But as so many fans of the arts know,performing is not just about making it big and winning awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gives you confidence and self-respect and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that’s exactly what Genesis discovers when she joins the choirand is urged to enter a talent show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book isn’t “about” the theater, but anyone who loveswhat exposure to the arts can accomplish in kids will take it to their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Magic Is Dead By Ian Frisch $26.99, Dey Street Books Magic is dead!

Monty Python Speaks: An Oral History By David Morgan $17.99, Dey Street Books Whether you think of their concert comedy performances, the smash Broadway musical “Spamalot!” or direct descendants like the silliness of “The Play That Goes Wrong” (nowensconced Off Broadway and on tour) or Taylor Mac’s upcoming comedy “Gary: A Sequel ToTitus Andronicus,” Monty Python’s influence on the theater is obvious. (Indeed, the perfectfarces of the sitcom “Fawlty Towers” would make a delicious stage show.) So theater buffs of asilly sort should delight in this revised and updated oral history of Monty Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They began inTV and conquered film but they are vaudevillians at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who loves the theater shouldlove learning more about their absurd, sophomoric and brilliant work.A Working Diary By Julie Hesmondhalgh $25.95, Methuen Drama Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh typifies the life of so many British actors, at least those who are talented and in-demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2016-2017, she jumps back and forth from stage to TV to film toradio, all while keeping a diary that should be a treat for fans and aspiring actors alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bestknown in the UK for her long-running stint on the primetime soap “Coronation Street,”Hesmondhalgh documents a remarkably productive period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was wrapping up a year oftheater with her politically committed troupe Take Back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then – take a deep breath – shetackled everything from the third season of the TV drama “Broadchurch” to a revival of the play“Wit” that might just transfer to the West End to diving into extensive rehearsals with directorMike Leigh for his epic period film “Peterloo.” And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As oneexpects from British actors, Hesmondhalgh is witty, insightful, self-deprecating and wears herintelligence easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the creator of the website BookFilter, a book lover’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written for Huffington Post, New York Post, New York Daily News, Los Angeles Times, The Advocate, and many other publications, profiling talent, covering the theater business, and reviewing shows in New York City and London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he’s not attending the theater, he’s reading about it.KEEP READING: Broadway’s Rising Stars: Winter/Spring 2019Mean Girls on Broadway: “I’d Rather Be Me” Official Lyrics &amp; MeaningSEE ALL NEWS Join Our Newsletter General Info Find Shows Broadway Venues Bookfilter’s February Pick of the Month</p>
