Monty Python Speaks: An Oral History By David Morgan $17.99, Dey Street Books Whether you think of their concert comedy performances, the smash Broadway musical “Spamalot!” or direct descendants like the silliness of “The Play That Goes Wrong” (nowensconced Off Broadway and on tour) or Taylor Mac’s upcoming comedy “Gary: A Sequel ToTitus Andronicus,” Monty Python’s influence on the theater is obvious. (Indeed, the perfectfarces of the sitcom “Fawlty Towers” would make a delicious stage show.) So theater buffs of asilly sort should delight in this revised and updated oral history of Monty Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They began inTV and conquered film but they are vaudevillians at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who loves the theater shouldlove learning more about their absurd, sophomoric and brilliant work.A Working Diary By Julie Hesmondhalgh $25.95, Methuen Drama Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh typifies the life of so many British actors, at least those who are talented and in-demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2016-2017, she jumps back and forth from stage to TV to film toradio, all while keeping a diary that should be a treat for fans and aspiring actors alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bestknown in the UK for her long-running stint on the primetime soap “Coronation Street,”Hesmondhalgh documents a remarkably productive period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was wrapping up a year oftheater with her politically committed troupe Take Back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then – take a deep breath – shetackled everything from the third season of the TV drama “Broadchurch” to a revival of the play“Wit” that might just transfer to the West End to diving into extensive rehearsals with directorMike Leigh for his epic period film “Peterloo.” And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As oneexpects from British actors, Hesmondhalgh is witty, insightful, self-deprecating and wears herintelligence easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the creator of the website BookFilter, a book lover’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written for Huffington Post, New York Post, New York Daily News, Los Angeles Times, The Advocate, and many other publications, profiling talent, covering the theater business, and reviewing shows in New York City and London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he’s not attending the theater, he’s reading about it.KEEP READING: Broadway’s Rising Stars: Winter/Spring 2019Mean Girls on Broadway: “I’d Rather Be Me” Official Lyrics &amp; MeaningSEE ALL NEWS Join Our Newsletter General Info Find Shows Broadway Venues Bookfilter’s February Pick of the Month</p>
