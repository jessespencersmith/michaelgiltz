The cleverest set designs on TV, with one new location after another as quirky and oddball as any Tim Burton movie? The engaging narration by Jim Dale (who did the audio book versions of Harry Potter) and strikes the perfect tone of whimsy? The great cast, with Friel ascrewball heroine, Pace adorable, McBride a revelation and Kristin Chenoweth as good as always as a waitress pining for Ned? I gave the show about three episodes before I assumed the cutesy tone Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

I'll be watching Fringe , like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: Water Lilies ($26.98; Koch Lorber) -- No one takes childhood or first love more seriously than the French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First time director Celine Sciamma peers intimately into the lives of three 15 year old girls exploring their sexuality against a backdrop of competitive synchronized swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne isheavy and determined to lose her virginity as soon as possible, preferably to the dashing Francois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Floriane is naturally sexy and flirtatious but hasn't actually slept with anyone, even her nominal boyfriend, the ever-present Francois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then there's our heroine Marie (a gawky Pauline Acquart with lovely full lips who will clearly be a beauty when she grows up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marie is friends with Anne but shadows the black sheep Floriane around, becoming so besotted with her that she steals Floriane's trash and even eats scraps of food that were thrown away by her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beautiful and sharp- edged without being sad, it has some quiet passages that are grippingly frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smart Movies -- Bright Lights Big City ($14.98; MGM) doesn't transcend its era but Michael J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox is an underrated dramatic actor (bonus: the great cinematographer Gordon Willis provides audio commentary); The Art of Travel ($24.98; First Look), a romantic drama about a man whodumps his cheating bride-to-be and goes on his honeymoon alone finds Christopher Masterson ofMalcolm in the Middle hoping to make a similar transition -- he's got the goods, too; three oddball noirs, including Roadhouse, Moontide and Boomerang with Dana Andrews ($14.98 each; Fox) and every time I hear the name "Dana Andrews" I can't help but think of Seth Green's line in WoodyAllen's Radio Days; and Gospel According to Harry ($29.95; Kino) from 1994 finds Viggo Mortensen in a genuinely surreal, typically oddball film about a disintegrating marriage fromPolish director Lech Majewski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blu-Ray -- The flood of Blu-Ray titles is growing, especially the mannish-boy titles that guys who are early adopters eat up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out now is Transformers Special Edition ($39.99; Dreamworks), which is $10 more than the regular DVD; Black Mask ($29.99; Lionsgate) with Jet Li, which is $20 (!) more than the regular DVD but boasts that it is "Beyond High Definition" since it's in 1080p; andThe Invincible Iron Man ($29.99; Lionsgate) which is a direct to DVD animated feature released by Marvel and costs $15 more than the regular DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've got to keep urging them to make Blu-Raythe same price as regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They should see Blu-Ray as a chance to offer MORE value to theDVD faithful who are willing to upgrade their machine, not as a chance to raise the prices of DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Marker -- The utterly unique French director/essayist is best known for the short La Jetee, the 1962 film which told its futuristic tale mostly through still images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His roving curiosity and eclectic approach to storytelling has created a much more substantial body of work than mostknow and Icarus Films is celebrating his career with four major DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Case of the Grinning Cat ($29.98; Icarus) begins with his intrigue over some graffiti of a yellow cat that pops up in Paris after 9-11 and leads to a years-long journey. (The DVD also includes seven shorts.) The Sixth SideOf The Pentagon/The Embassy ($24.98; Icarus) contains two shorts, one a collaboration covering the 1967 Vietnam protests that Norman Mailer covered in Armies of the Night and the other afictional tale cunningly disguised as found footage from the early 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The LastBolshevik/Happiness ($34.98) is probably a great starting point for newcomers, including a silent film by Russian director Alexander Medvekin and Marker's probing look at Modvekin's life fromthe October Revolution to the collapse of communism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, there's Remembrance of Things ToCome ($24.98l Icarus) a collaboration with the daughter of photographer Denise Bellon that uses her work to document Paris from 1935 to 1955.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this range of offbeat, daring and bold topicscombined with daring approaches to storytelling doesn't intrigue you, then your cinematic hearthas stopped beating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kids films -- Emma Watson is clearly the one to watch among the group of kids who came of age in the Harry Potter films but her talent isn't fully exploited in Ballet Shoes ($24.98; Koch Lorber), a movie that is mainly for girls who have worn out their DVD of The Red Shoes and read the beloved book (namechecked in You've Got Mail ) this is based on over and over again; The Blue Elephant ($19.98; Genius) is a mild, cheaply animated film, though it's always nice to hear Carl Reiner barking; Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow ($19.98; Lionsgate) lets the kids of superheroes kick some ass -- these straight to DVD animated titles don't seem to harm the "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

Robert De Niro Nanny Sues For $40,000 Demi Moore's Twitter-Based Suicide Intervention SNL: Madonna And Angelina In Weekend Update...franchises the way I fear Disney's do, but they still appear questionable to me when the live action movies are doing so well; It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown ($19.98; Warner Bros.) is the only other Peanuts special I enjoy and it comes with two songs to download, a weaker special and a featurette; and Bratz: Girlz Really Rock ($19.98; Lionsgate) has the rebellious gals getting kids at summer camp for actors and musicians to lighten up and not practice so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, it's so boring to have to learn how to actually play an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Documentaries -- Derek ($29.95; Kino) is a labor of love by actress Tilda Swinton and director Isaac Julien that explores the work of the late Derek Jarman via extensive clips, commentary from friends and an interview done in 1994 shortly before Jarman died (also out just now is Jarman'sWar Requiem at the same price from Kino); Lagerfeld Confidential ($29.98; Koch Lorber) trades access for objectivity in this peek into the fashion world of Karl Lagerfeld; Monster Camp ($24.98; Life Size) is a genial if low-rent look at larpers -- people who bring their love for Dungeons &amp;Dragons et all to life by indulging in Live Action Role Playing; Kordavision: The Man Who ShotChe Guevara ($19.98; Anchor Bay) examines the wide-ranging career of Alberto Korda, who has done fashion photography, underwater imaging, Cuba under Castro and that iconic image of Chewhich is one of the most famous and widely reproduced images of all time; The Case For Faith($19.98; Lionsgate) is too mild to convert the likes of Bill Maher but can provide info and comfortfor Christians who grapple with major issues (like why is there evil) by having journalist LeeStrobel talk with leading thinkers; Norah Jones: Live From Austin Tx ($19.98; New West) finds Jones increasingly confident as a performer - now if only she would amp up the melodies andhooks on her sometimes vague new compositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grab Bag -- Jesse Bradford is still cute as a button and still looking for a movie role that fits him as well as the role of gardener on Desperate Housewives -- My Sassy Girl ($27.98; Fox) isn't it; Itty Bitty Titty Comittee ($27.95; Wolfe) is a romantic drama from the director of But I'm A Cheerleader and deserves mention if only for having the cleverest title since The Totally True Adventures of Two Girls in Love; Cannibal Terror ($19.95; Severin) is gorey sexploitation from 1980 of the lowest (or is that highest?) order; Miley's dad Billy Ray Cyrus can't reel in any laughs (sorry) in the witless comedy Baitshop ($19.98; Lionsgate) -- on the other hand he's better here than when hosting TV's Nashville Star; UFC Classics 9 and 10 ($19.98; Lionsgate) include the brutal fights held in Detroit and Birmingham, Alabama and while my mom lives in Birmingham,somehow I think she missed this so I'll have to send her the DVD; and it doesn't get more silly than the sexploitation of Tarzeena Queen of Kong Island ($14.98; Retromedia) with Christine Nguyen as our barely clad heroine fighting the bad guys alongside Tabonga, her loyal gorilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV on DVD -- The Big Bang Theory First Season ($29.98; Warner Bros.) is the only new sitcom from last season that looks like a hit and I have friends who enjoy the show but every time I tune in it just seems hopelessly traditional, right down to "zingers" and a noisy laugh track; DesperateHousewives Season 4 ($59.99; ABC) is something I need more than ever since I stopped watchingthe series after that natural disaster; Life Season One ($29.98; NBC) is a crime drama my friend Aaron swears by and I sure like Damien Lewis but I just wish they'd drop the wildly complex"mystery" that overshadows everything; Cheers Season 10 ($39.98; Paramount) is about four seasons after they should have called it a day, but these episodes aren't as tired as I rememberedthanks to a great cast; Ghost Whisperer Third Season ($63.98; Paramount) wants us to believe spirits keep getting in touch with Jennifer Love Hewitt and that's really not hard to imagine thoughI still keep thinking Bailey will be pissed; and The Office Season Four ($49.98; Universal) reallyastonishes me because it was such an awful idea to remake that perfect British sitcom and then itwas such a lame imitation for a year and now it's so fully its own, marvelous show that I am prettymuch gobsmacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Didn't watch Pushing Diasies but I did hear it was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NicoleAnon See Profile I'm a Fan of NicoleAnon permalink I just watched the first season of Mad Men - it's so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ByrdtheStampede See Profile I'm a Fan of ByrdtheStampede permalink I was surprised by Terminator: TSCC - Summer Glau is rather brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The season premiere was rather incredible, hinting at great new layers in an otherwise shallow, action-y premise. wayoutleft See Profile I'm a Fan of wayoutleft permalink they are pulling off the human interest between explosions, aren't they. i hate leather-vinylsuper violent females... but TSCC is working for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BlackJAC See Profile I'm a Fan of BlackJAC permalink I believe I shall save my money for CHUCK next week instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it is written, so it shall Flash. wayoutleft See Profile I'm a Fan of wayoutleft permalink i lost friends in the global Roswell community after with-holding total hysterical enthusiasm for daisies.i'm seeing a well-established trend toward the ensemble-based series, as opposed to single heroseries. people are looking for a richer interaction pattern than single hero offers. special effects keepsingle hero the preferred cinematic approach; but tv audiences need lots of people- especially given thespecificity of character required before viewers are willing to identify. and people love to see friendship. some of us true geniuses are smart enough to realize that after seinfeld and friends ruled the last decade. i know it's subtle, but we're finally there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heidfeld See Profile I'm a Fan of Heidfeld permalink Ok... so the guy can't kiss or touch his girlfriend in any way... and they insinuate kissing but putting twodolls together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How very Disney and how very pathetic. cnobody See Profile I'm a Fan of cnobody permalink Eli Stone had so much Ally McBeal in it that I was astonished to learn that it was not, indeed, a David E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kelly production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pushing Daisies is one of my favorite new shows, or at least new last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was one that I fearedwould get lost in the strike, but I'm glad to be seeing promos on ABC for the new season. phew!
