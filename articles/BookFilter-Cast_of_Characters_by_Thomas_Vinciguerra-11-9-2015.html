The accretion of detail is admirable at first but eventually frustrating.Still, Vinciguerra usually keeps all their foibles and brilliance in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a little too kind at times. (Forexample, Arno is a physically abusive man who welched on child support; Vinciguerra doesn't forgive but sees it asevincing his anger at the world and describes Arno giving one date a "shiner," far too colorful and friendly a word forbeating her up.) More problematic is that this truly is about a cast of characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each vivid, eccentric character getsour full attention, one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New Yorker itself is a little lost in all this, with little sense of forwardmomentum allowed to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, highlights like the takedown of Time magazine and John Hersey's Hiroshimapiece are captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is a series of portraits more than the journey of the magazine itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's intelligent,well-grounded, and moment-to-moment entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a cast of characters like this, how could it fail? Now if onlyI had Gibbs or Ross or Shawn to edit this rambling little review.... -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayA fresh view….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ably captures the antic spirit of the New Yorker's first heyday. - Kirkus ReviewsCaptures the eccentricities and idiosyncrasies of its editors and writers…will be embraced be faithful New Yorkerreaders. - Publishers WeeklyVinciguerra’s writing has a way of bringing these characters to sparkling life….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New Yorker readers are a dedicatedlot and will snap this ‘golden age’ volume up. - BooklistIt's a beautiful book and a sad book, as the flood of time and modernity rises before the Cast of Characters can walkin pairs to the ark. - P.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O’Rourke Irresistible…a banquet of information about the good writing and bad manners of the eccentric crew who made amyth both of themselves and of the journal they made famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vinciguerra writes a sharp, crisp sentence, and tellshis story with brio. - John Lahr, author of Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh</p>
