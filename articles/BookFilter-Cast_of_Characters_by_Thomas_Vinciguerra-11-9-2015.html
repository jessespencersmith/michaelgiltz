The accretion of detail is admirable at first but eventually frustrating.Still, Vinciguerra usually keeps all their foibles and brilliance in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a little too kind at times. (Forexample, Arno is a physically abusive man who welched on child support; Vinciguerra doesn't forgive but sees it asevincing his anger at the world and describes Arno giving one date a "shiner," far too colorful and friendly a word forbeating her up.) More problematic is that this truly is about a cast of characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each vivid, eccentric character getsour full attention, one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New Yorker itself is a little lost in all this, with little sense of forwardmomentum allowed to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, highlights like the takedown of Time magazine and John Hersey's Hiroshimapiece are captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is a series of portraits more than the journey of the magazine itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's intelligent,well-grounded, and moment-to-moment entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a cast of characters like this, how could it fail?
