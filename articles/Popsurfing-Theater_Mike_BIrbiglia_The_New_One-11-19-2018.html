                <p>MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2018 THEATER: Mike Birbiglia's "New" Baby MIKE BIRBIGLIA'S "THE NEW ONE" *** out of **** CORT THEATRE I want to know as little about a show as possible before I see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would be true even if I wasn't a critic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever since that Canadian kid visiting South Florida for the summer blurted out to me that DarthVader was Luke Skywalker's father BEFORE I saw The Empire Strikes Back, I've been horrified by spoilers. ("Why? Why did you tell me?") Despite all this, I'm not a fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On revivals, I'll perk up whenhearing details about their approach to a show, like the recentOklahoma at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's that included corn bread and chili during the interval and a general picnic-vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cool! So I've seen Mike Birbiglia before, I knew his new show was about becoming a father (the new one is a baby) and I heard...murmurings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By and large, his stand-up persona is to self-deprecate; most of Birbiglia's jokes are at his own expense, especially whendetailing the myriad medical issues that have bedeviled him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So itseemed out of character for such an everyman, relatable guy, but Ikept hearing he came across as a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He crossed some line and risked people...well, it wasn't that they wouldn't like him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They would hate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a terrible person! Don't be that honest, Mike! WTF? Whatcould he have possibly said? Well, it's not a spoiler, so I won't feel bad in telling you that during his new show about being a new parent, Birbiglia confesses that being aparent is...really hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, he goes farther, but that's the gist of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infact, Birbiglia confesses it's so hard that -- and here he drops to thatconspiratorial whisper where you imagine he's speaking to you and you alone -- that he understands why some men leave. (I'll admit, a small ripple of astonishment spread through the audience at theperformance I attended.) Yeah, he gets it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Birbiglia immediatelyfollows that "confession" with a reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't mind tellingus this because he knows: HE'LL NEVER LEAVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not a chance.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ► 2019 (7) ▼ 2018 (34) ► December (7) ▼ November (4)Well, if that's bold, someone should have told the classic original sitcom Roseanne or a thousand other TV shows where the parentscheerfully joked about dumping the kids and heading for the hills.Heck, even moms can feel sometimes it's a hell of a lot of work and they've considered tossing in the towel. (Of course, women abandoning their kids is somehow even more difficult for people toaccept, much as they understand it intellectually.) Now remember,we're not talking about adults leaving their kids on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're talking about parents overwhelmed by the responsibility and admitting to themselves and each other, "Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is hard." I never would have thought this was Lenny Bruce territory, deeply confessional truth-telling that risked alienating an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show I saw was warmly embraced and ended on just the sort of awww emotional moment you saw coming a mile away but stillsort of bought since we're all suckers when it comes to the emotionalbond of parent and child. [Here's Birbiglia on Jimmy Kimmel talking about his show.] That's how the show ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it begins with a couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a nifty throughline, Birbiglia charts his maturity through his couch, whichstarted with a beast he "rescued" off the street (his roommates gave him an "awesome" and a thumbs up) and then progressed to deciding he was going to go full adult and buy a new couch only to experiencesticker shock and finally discovering his beloved favorite couch (theplace he would collapse after weeks on the road doing standup) had been commandeered by "the new one." And God help him if he thought this was temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maturity becomes him, that's for certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Birbiglia has a sad sack, Ray Romano sort of vibe (he must have turned down sitcoms by now) withhis own sneaky delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He keeps calling his wife by the wrong name (a hilarious distillation of male indifference; "oh, it's our anniversary? "), bemoans any change, laughably thinks the fact that his wife sayingTHEATER: Mike Birbiglia's "New" Baby THEATER: The Irresistible Raul Esparza in "Arturo ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: A Musical "King Kong?"
