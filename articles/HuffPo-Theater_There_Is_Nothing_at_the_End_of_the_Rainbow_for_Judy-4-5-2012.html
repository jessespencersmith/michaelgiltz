No, it's a proper show, more's the pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garland flounces into her London hotel suite, a lavish room complete with rehearsal piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's engaged to her manager Mickey (Tom Pelphrey) and momentarily off the drugs and booze to prepare for a five week comeback concert at The Talk Of The Town venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along for the ride is Anthony (Michael Cumpsty), a gay Scottish pianist who doesn't drink and can't abide cursing and yet somehow is an old dear friend of Garland's, despite their fall-out during a disastrous toursome five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony is the adoring gay fan stand-in, reminding Garland of a marriage she forgot(they do pile up), telling her she's beautiful, reminding her of all her great performances and even in amoment of vulnerability indulging in the fantasy of whisking Garland away to safety where he can rescueher from her fate. (The same sort of fantasies swirl around Elvis and Michael Jackson.) Anthony and Mickey dislike each other intensely, though it's hard to see why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For much of the show, they're both focused on the same goal: keeping Garland off her addictions so she can be healthy andperform at her best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mickey insists gay fans love Garland to be miserable.

At least we get to hear those songs performed in the Garland style, right? Barely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For much of the lengthy 80 minute first act, songsare performed only in snippets or out of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We get a brief rehearsal early on, with Judy andAnthony working on the tempo for a number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a teeny tiny glimpse of what might have been: achance to imagine an artist at work, serious work as she crafts a show and finds new life and insight insongs she has sung many times before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we have to wait most of the first act before even a singlenumber is performed in its entirety, something that rarely happens after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real show stopper is the set "transformation" from the hotel room to the nightclub (the set and costumes are the responsibility of William Dudley).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most every scene (except for a brief, pointless BBCradio interview) takes place in the hotel suite or onstage at the venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To make the transition, the center panel of the room flies up and a band is revealed to back Garland up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bizarrely, the entire rest of the hotel suite stays right in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't even bother to move the couch or chairs or luggage most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all just sits there on stage, huge chunks of set and furniture cluttering up our vision while we're supposed to imagine Garland in that famed cabaret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One doesn't need elaborate sets or massive trickery in the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But whatever constraints are at play here -- are the wings too shallow? -- one struggles tounderstand why the furniture wasn't at least wheeled out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience can be asked to use itsimagination but the set designer at the very least should do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, none of this would matter if you heard huge chunks of classic songs performed with even one-tenth of Garland's artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't because so few of the tunes (maybe four or five?) are delivered in theirentirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the most puzzling occurs at the end of the first act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until then, every song is performed ina natural context; that is, Garland is rehearsing a number or singing out a line or two as a joke orperforming on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But suddenly at the finale this pattern is dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band is "revealed" but ascrim of sorts is left in place so we know we're not at the nightclub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first and only time in theshow, we are seeing Garland perform in some shadow nether region, her most personal and privateplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's belting out "The Man That Got Away," one of her greatest numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem is thatthere's no emotional reason for her to be singing this song at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judy isn't remembering thereal love of her life (whether that would be a man or her fans or whomever) and she's certainly notthinking about her fiance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has left the hotel simply to buy her cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why this would trigger anumber of transcendent pain and regret is unfathomable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet there she is, for the first and only time in the show, singing a number for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act Two is no better with Mickey becoming more cynical with each passing moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When seeing a new work, I always assume the blame for a bad show lies with the behind the scenes people; when even themarvelously talented Michael Cumpsty can't create an interesting character, you've every reason toassume the other actors are equally ham-strung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pelphrey and Bennett have no chemistry to speak of;they bark and curse at each other but it feels less like a roller coaster and more like pro forma battling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Slash Caught Fellow Rocker Naked With His Mom DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 7 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3Recommend 291 Recommend 699 Like 235 Keep on Trucking, Travis Small Town Jerk Kyra Sedgwick on "The Possession" What's Your Favorite Michael Jackson Memory?

Is that supposed to be some sort of revelation?

"I was just one ofthem," he says with false modesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One wonders if any of the others could play "Blue Skies" on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You should screen one of Garland's classic films or listen to her Carnegie Hall album or watch some of the episodes of her legendary TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any one of them would give you far more insight and appreciation for the artistry of one of entertainment's legendary performers than this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All End OfThe Rainbow will do is make you dislike some of her more ardent, clueless fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a look at Garland at her peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four-star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Assistance ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Blood Knot at Signature ** Bob *** 1/2 Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1950 ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Carrie ** 1/2 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Elections 2012 Oasis 2012 Net Neutrality Anatomical Wonders Barack Obama Natural Disasters Barack Obama 2012 Guatemala MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» ricky_martin RetweetMake Room for (the New) Daddy http://t.co/Q6eIDokm via @huffingtonpost feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, manyothers including octopi, havehuman-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQhThe Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Close Up Space * Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Damn Yankees ** Death Of A Salesman with Philip Seymour Hoffman ** 1/2 Dedalus Lounge * 1/2 Early Plays (Eugene O'Neill at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse) * Ernani at Met w Angela Meade *** 1/2 An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Galileo with F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray Abraham ** The Gershwins' Porgy And Bess *** 1/2 Godspell ** 1/2 Goodbar * 1/2 Gore Vidal's The Best Man ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 How The World Began * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Hurt Village *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later *** 1/2 Jesus Christ Superstar * 1/2 King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** The Lady From Dubuque ** 1/2 Lake Water ** Leo *** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Lysistrata Jones * The Maids ** Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Maple And Vine ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** Mission Drift * 1/2 Misterman ** 1/2 The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies at Papermill ** Newsies On Broadway ** 1/2 No Place To Go ** 1/2 Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This. * 1/2 Painting Churches * 1/2 Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Once *** 1/2 Once on Broadway **** Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 On A Clear Day You Can See Forever * 1/2 One Arm *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Private Lives ** Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Radio City Christmas Spectacular ** 1/2 Regrets * 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 Richard III w Kevin Spacey at BAM *** The Road To Mecca ** 1/2 Samuel &amp; Alasdair: A Personal History Of The Robot War ** 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Seminar ** Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Shlemiel The First ** 1/2 Silence!

( Here's a link to my original review on April 2. ) This show, which opened on Broadway in March of 1960 and was set at the presidential convention inPhilly that same year, shows two candidates going at each other to gain advantage in a deadlocked votewhere neither one has enough support to gain their party's nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Larroquette, that increasingly valuable stage actor, is the intellectual Easterner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Stamos is the wily, good-looking, more conservative plain talker who has dug up dirt on Larroquette's nervous breakdown and wants tosmear him out of the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stamos's role was originally played by Eric McCormack, who handled the wily subterfuge and gay subtext better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Stamos's take provides a clearer contrast to the classics- quoting Larroquette and brings a slight George W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush aura, which sets off their showdown nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cybill Shepherd has stepped in for Candice Bergen as Larroquette's estranged wife back in the saddle for the sake of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither women was wholly comfortable on stage though that would surely come with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where Bergin played the wife as thoroughly uncomfortable at every moment, Shepherd uses her cool reserve to show a woman who has made her decision and will live with it; she may not likethe situation but she's up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristin Davis has a hoot as the wife of Stamos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the biggest contrast is Elizabeth Ashley who steps in for the great but fragile Angela Lansbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lansbury was shaky physically and that gave her role a grand old dame vibe, whereas Ashley gets more mileage out of theSouthern belle, a flighty woman who has a steely reserve and serious points to make amidst her fluttering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All in all, the cast changes are fun and have reinvigorated and re-imagined (modestly) a light entertainment, the sort of show Broadway turned out with ease once upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vidal's play deals withtimeless issues of race and politics and morality and what it takes to win and whether you can sell your soul for victory and still do good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But mostly it just wants to have fun.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News: Paul Ryan's Speech Was Full Of 'Blatant Lies' Paul Ryan Speech Built On Demonstrably Misleading Assertions Friar Suggests Teens Seduce Priests In A Lot Of Sex Abuse Cases Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker Anti-Obama Signs Create Controversy Isaac Continues To Present Life-Threatening Weather WATCH: Why Michael Moore Thinks Romney Will Win Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies 9 Other Individuals, Companies And Organizations Besides Chick- Fil-A That Have Funded Anti- LGBT Politics DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 D.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Jefferson Mays gave a much subtler performance this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His fumbling, stumbling turn as an old military buddy of Stamos with some dirt of his own seemed goofier the first time I caught it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time Mays had settled in to a more wily, nuanced turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But best of all was Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the critic's night I saw him before the opening in April, he stumbled on some lines and seemed nearly as fragile in his burly way as Lansbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now he's a lion in winter, fully in charge and roaring with glee in his chewy role as an ailing president who rightly sees flaws in both candidates and can't for the life of him decide which one to support but mostly enjoys the final burst of attention and power his endorsement holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones is in fine fettle, making the most of the juicy, broadly outlined President Hockstader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might want to dip into Vidal's large body of work and start reading some of his historical novels, probably the art of his that will endure the longest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you're in New York and have a chance to see The Best Man , you'll receive the double pleasure of nodding goodbye to the late Vidal while savoring one of acting'slegends in excellent form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Gore Vidal late in his life, as waspish and politically charged as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
