) is always welcome. **** I'm always fascinated by curtain calls: the endless variations on taking a bow, the attitude of actors ranging from shyness to -- my favorite -- the false modesty of those who love applause best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this show, I was a bit astonished to see Steggert be the last to come on stage, when one assumed it would be Burton, even though it's clearly his character's story and he is onstage throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a nice acknowledgmentof Steggert's rising profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the primacy of the star wasn't completely forgotten: Burton was the last to leave the stage and took one final, grand bow on her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co- hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE TO READERS: I was provided with house seats to The Grand Manner during previews with the understanding that I would review the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER"black swan" bulimia "james franco" risd chair jpg mads mikkelsen mao's last dancer FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POSTTo Rielle Hunter WATCH: Wall Street Bull Crocheted By Artist Olek 6 Comments BLOG WATCH: Images Of The 'Beautiful Brooklyn Blizzard,' On My Modern Met 2 Comments Above the Fold-In: Al Jaffee Shares His Secrets 65 Comments WATCH: Gustavo Dudamel Appears On Jay Leno To Discuss Classical Music And Bieber's Haircut 7 Comments The Future of Playbills Rests in the iPad 2 Comments Like 4K Comments 0 Pending Comments 0View FAQ Haiku Reviews: Poetry, German Photography, Clay Gurus...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYC Artist Olek Crocheted Wall Street Bull As Oscar Approaches, Swiss Filmmaker Wants His...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hockney's iPad Art in FranceRelated News On Huffington Post: ARTIST SPOTLIGHT: Violinist Mikhail Simonyan WHO: Mikhail Simonyan, violinist WHAT: Debut as soloist with the New York Philharmonic WHEN: June 29 and 30, 2010 at 7:30pm WHERE:Avery Fisher...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALLET: Esa-Pekka Salonen's Violin Concerto At New York City Ballet Since leaving his position as Los Angeles Philharmonic music director last year, Esa-Pekka Salonen has been a regular at New York theaters.Last fall he... 60 Pianos To Be Scattered Around NYC NEW YORK — Consider them keys to the city: Anyone who gets asudden itch to tickle the ivories will be able to play free...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Around the Web: 'On the Levee' is undermined by rambling structure while 'Grand Manner' has ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Homage to Katharine Cornell in 'Grand Manner' Theater Week Theater Listings: July 2 — 8 Said the Playwright to the Young Actor...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kate Burton, daughter of Richard, and star of 'The Grand Manor,' reminisces ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Thomson: the importance of supporting actors More in Arts...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Death &amp; Dying CPAC Katie Holmes Harry Reid Wikileaks Pollster CES 2011 Twitter LA RestaurantsHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.Recency | PopularityART ED: 10 Nonprofits Teaching Arts Education To Kids Across The Country 5 Comments Comments are closed for this entry View All</p>
