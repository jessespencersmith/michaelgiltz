(extraterrestrials); A.I. (artificial intelligence); and SETI(search for extraterrestrial intelligence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debate has intensified overwhether life exists outside our solar system, what that life would looklike, and whether we’ll ever make contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Included here are essays from a broad spectrum of the scientific community: cosmologists, astrophysicists, NASA planetary scientists, and geneticists, to name just afew, discussing the latest research and theories relating to alien life.Some of the topics include: If life exists somewhere in space, what are the odds that it evolves… Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say This wide-ranging collection of essays by top scientists has multiple personalities, but I enjoyed them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some pieces are amusingly silly, like a run-down of how aliens are depicted in movies (with especial disdain for Ridley Scott's film"Prometheus") and a drolly straightforward recitation of the basics about some of the most famous claims of close encounters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others are vaguely speculative about science but most are rooted in the latest facts and offer intelligent summaries of what we know, why it's silly (or smart) to listen for radio signals, why studying the consciousness of theoctopus is good practice for encountering alien life and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of all are the sharply differing opinions -- you'll read oneShare This Book About The Author Jim Al-Khalili MoreJIM AL-KHALILI OBE is an Iraqi-born British theoretical physicist, author and broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is currently Professor ofTheoretical Physics and Chair in the Public Engagement in Science at the University of Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His most recent book, Life on theEdge: The Coming of Age of QuantumBiology … Release Info List Price: $25.00 (Hardcover) Published: May 09, 2017 Publisher: Picador Pages: 224 ISBN 10: 1250109639 ISBN 13: 9781250109637piece that makes clear how very likely it is that life as we know it exists on other planets only to later read another equally convincing essay that asserts it's highly unlikely we'll discover life on other planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's science for you - no certainty other than the knowledge that facts are fascinating and we'll follow them wherever they lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure who the audience might be for this, but as a sci-fi reading buff who enjoys hearing the latest discoveries and layman'sdescriptions of cutting edge theories, I was right at home. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
