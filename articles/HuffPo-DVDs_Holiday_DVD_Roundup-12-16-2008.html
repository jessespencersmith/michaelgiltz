CLASSIC TV, SMARTLY PACKAGED -- Special Christmas episodes are a tradition on TV, especially for sitcoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV Sets: Holiday Treats ($12.98; Paramount) has an ugly cover but don't let bad wrapping fool you into missing out on this bargain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It collects eight holiday-themed episodes ofhit shows from the 60s to the 90s, ranging from The Andy Griffith Show (Andy and Barney throw a Christmas party for a prisoner) to The Honeymooners (Ralph sells his bowling ball to get Alice a nice gift) to The Brady Bunch (mom gets laryngitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other shows include I Love Lucy, Taxi, Family Ties, Wings and Frasier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doris Day: Christmas Memories ($14.98; MPI) contains three holiday episodes from her sitcom but what really won me over were the extras: commentary from Dayherself (who is LONG overdue for an honorary Oscar), newsreels of Day, and holiday episodes ofher radio show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Shari Lewis Christmas ($9.98; S'More) also is generous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get her threeholiday shows (best for old folks looking to get nostalgic and the very young), plus another onefrom her local New York show Hi Mom, and a theatrical trailer offering a Christmas greeting from Lewis and Lamb Chop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, if the relatives are getting on your nerves, you can fantasize aboutmurder and escape America with Lovejoy Christmas Specials (($24.98; BBC Video).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains two 90 minute movies set during the holidays -- one in Prague and the other in North Carolina andif spending Christmas with Ian McShane seems odd, you've been watching too much Deadwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WOULD-BE TV CLASSICS MAKE THEIR CASE -- Five new specials hope to get lodged in your brain and at least two of them might just do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift Of All ($19.99; Paramount) pretended to mock those Bing Crosby specials from the 70s but in fact lovedthem and did its best to recreate their silly charm, thanks to some fine original songs and musical guests like Elvis Costello, Feist, Willie Nelson and even a singing Jon Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wonder Pets: Save The Nutcracker! ($16.99; Paramount) is a clever way to introduce that classic ballet's music to a toddler and the three other episodes included ain't holiday themed but will surprise adults who haven't sampled this silly, musically sophisticated show yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love Sesame Street and Dora The Explorer is better than GPS in my book, but Elmo's Christmas Countdown ($14.93; Genius) and Dora Celebrates Three Kings Day ($16.99; Paramount) are both DVDs the kids can watch while I'm in the next room cooking or playing video poker or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while I've never been a bigfan of the Shrek movie franchise, I was very pleasantly surprised by the TV special Shrek The Halls ($19.99; Dreamworks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's priced too high for a 22 minute TV episode but it cut back on theincessant pop cultural references and created a genuinely delightful holiday gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OLD VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW AND BLACK/WHITE VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COLOR -- Why anyone would watch the live action Jim Carrey version of Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas when the animated TV special is so perfect is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you don't own it and want it, this Limited Edition Collectible GiftSet ($34.98; Universal) contains loads of extras and a snow globe to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, why anyone would want a colorized version of Holiday Inn (the Bing Crosby flick that introduced "White Christmas") is also a head-scratcher but this new edition ($26.98; Universal) has a lovely newblack and white print, a colorized version you can hand off to someone you don't like and a CDwith 12 songs from the soundtrack including "Happy Holidays." MORE HOLIDAY HOPEFULS -- Among the other titles with holiday themes that strove for classic status (but fell short) are Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage ($19.98; Lionsgate); Jim Henson's The Christmas Toy ($14.98; Lionsgate/Hit) which is minus the Kermit bookend; Rankin "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

The 1951 British film "Scrooge" starring Alistair Sim is essential viewing in our house at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was definitely the best Scrooge to ever grace the big screen -- a real mean bastard at the beginning, but barely able to contain his own joyous compassion by the film's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of the movie holds upvery well -- even the primitive special effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hardcore fans of classic British cinema &amp; TV willenjoy seeing some familiar faces in the supporting cast like Michael Hordern and a very young Patrick MacNee (aka "John Steed" of The Avengers). "Scrooge" was finally given a proper DVD release a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film itself looks great, but the DVD extras are pretty much worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a second disc with a colorized version of the film (gag!)and an awkward commentary with the actor who played the 'young" Ebenezer Scrooge which isn'tparticularly informative or entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the movie is so good, I still consider this disc a "must-own." BlackJAC See Profile I'm a Fan of BlackJAC permalink We watch the Jim Carrey GRINCH because it fleshes out Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss' original intent: a protest of thecommercialization of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the cartoon, the Grinch was simply a generic villain who acted like a jerk simply to be a jerk; in the live-action one, the Whos brought it upon themselves by mocking him for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And ya gotta love how the Grinch calls them out on their mindless, self-righteous greed before going Delta-House-at-the-homecoming-parade on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Good defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ron Howard and Jim carrey should send you at least a Happy Holidays card! ecunning See Profile I'm a Fan of ecunning permalink Another good one you may not have heard of is "Bernard and the Genie," starring Lenny Henry and Alan Cumming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British, hysterical, and heartwarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan plays Bernard, a schlubby little guy whose holiday goes terribly wrong: he gets fired from his job, his girlfriend leaves him for his best friend, and his apartment is emptied in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, he picks up the one thing she left behind--an old lamp--and polishes it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter Lenny Henry, a wild and crazy genie who has a little trouble adjusting to the loss of 3000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bernie, Big Macs, ice cream, soul music, and movies help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crises ensue, but it all works out wonderfully in the end.You'll LOVE it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Nope, hadn't heard of that one either, though Alan Cumming has a genie is easy to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll look for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thx. ecunning See Profile I'm a Fan of ecunning permalink A Muppet Family Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My absolute favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like the Muppets, this has Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and the Muppets all as one big crazy family getting together for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the original performers, full of that zany Muppet humor, anda cameo by Jim Henson at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best thing they ever did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it was Jim's favorite, too. (The original uncut version from TV is the very best--they had to edit out some of the songs for VHS/DVD release due to licensing issues.)

Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink A charmer and one I haven't seen in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I actually avoid watching the same moviesevery single year so I don't dim the pleasure of It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas Story, Charlie Brown Pee-wee et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Miracle on 34 St has rested for a few years and I need to see it again. 3fingerbrown See Profile I'm a Fan of 3fingerbrown permalink A wonderful Christmas DVD is the 1963 Judy Garland Christmas show--with Mel Tome, Jack Jones, and Liza, Lorna, and Joey--the grandmama of all Christmas specials, and a fascinating snapshot of itsfragile star and her era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a camp classic, of course, but there's something poignant about thisobviously troubled person playing out a fantasy version of her life.http://www.tvparty.com/xmasjudy.html And us "A Christmas Carol" fans will get our annual Alastair Sim fix, but a good alternative is the George C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott TV version from the '80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nice production values, impeccably cast, smart script, and Scott is magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It recalls a pre-cable, pre-Internet time when the big-three networks had lots of money to spend on their prestige shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hard to imagine CBS mounting such a lavish productiontoday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I might watch Scott again just to give Sims a rest, but Sims is absolutely the one to beat whenit comes to A Christmas Carol. (On DVD, mind you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd go see Patrick Stewart do his one-man show every year if I could and don't ever miss the chance if you can see him either.) Iactually own that Judy garland episode but have never watched it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll give it a whirl this year.Thx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GEE See Profile I'm a Fan of GEE permalink Capote's "A Christmas Memory" is one of my favorites--a PBS B&amp;W classic with the great GeraldinePage and Capote's narration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was surprised by how affecting it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I've read the story (along with Dylan Thomas' A Child's Christmas in Wales it's my favorite)but never seen that film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll keep a look out for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MagisterLudi See Profile I'm a Fan of MagisterLudi permalink Now for real alternatives: Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:16 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:37 AM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:16 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:04 AM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:18 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:02 AM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:20 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:39 AM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:20 PM on 12/17/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: Holiday DVD Roundup http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-holiday-dvd-roundup_b_151528.html [4/5/2009 12:54:26 PM] The German "Die Feuerzangenbowle" from 1944!

Well done. daffey See Profile I'm a Fan of daffey permalink We start every season with A Charlie Brown Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The animated Grinch comes in a close second.The old Rankin/Bass animated ones are OK (though as an adult, I can't miss the counter-culturethemes, especially in the later ones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Little Drummer Boy is a notable exception, and I tend to enjoy itbetter as the years go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, Year Without A Santa Clause, if only for the show stopping MiserBrothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for me, I also watch Spies Like Us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sounds silly, but I have a beer and watch that inmemory of a very fun time in life when my best friend and I saw it right before the first Christmas break our first year of college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though you never know when a new one will come along and add itself to the Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:51 AM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:21 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:50 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:27 PM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:29 AM on 12/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:04 AM on 12/17/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: Holiday DVD Roundup http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-holiday-dvd-roundup_b_151528.html [4/5/2009 12:54:26 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw an old theatrical production called House Without A Christmas Tree, and every so many years like to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a Wonderful Life is nice every so many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course, A Christmas Story 24 hours on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nice post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for the memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink The Miser Brothers can't be beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did you watch the new sequel that just aired on ABCFamily with them? I've never seen House Without A Christmas Tree -- I'll have to keep awatch out for it. daffey See Profile I'm a Fan of daffey permalink No, I didn't see the new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was taken by the change in their appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andwithout Dick Shaun, I wondered if it would have that same 'zing' that the original did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for House without a Christmas tree, it starred the late, great Jason Robards as a man embittered by the loss of his wife who won't allow his daughter to have a Christmas tree because of the memories it brings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a TV movie, much like a filmed play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My parents bought me the VCR tape, so I don't know if it is DVD or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think my Dad liked it because his Dad was never overly sentimental when it came toletting his kids celebrate Christmas (one year their ironing board doubled as the 'Christmas Tree').&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So good luck finding it, it's quaint, believable, and a hidden little gem in the army of specials that are out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LameDuckHunting See Profile I'm a Fan of LameDuckHunting permalink "The Ref" is my personal holiday favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JimmyD See Profile I'm a Fan of JimmyD permalink Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just watched it last weekend!
