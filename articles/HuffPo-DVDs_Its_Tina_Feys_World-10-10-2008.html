(Certainly almost nomen have done so either.) Fey isn't just starringin the Emmy-winning 30 Rock Season 2 ($39.98; Universal), the way Roseanne and Mary TylerMoore and Lucille Ball did on their definingshows in decades past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's her baby in every way,with Fey also writing and producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fey also hashit films to her name like the modest comedyBaby Mama and the more successful Mean Girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A multi-million dollar bidding war ensued over her upcoming memoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And to top it off, she is a dead-ringer for VP candidate Sarah Palin and hasdone double duty by imitating Palin on easily the funniest political humor on Saturday Night Livethat we've seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there's ever been a funnier, more spot-on imitation of a politicalfigure, stretching from Rich Little's Nixon to Will Ferrel's George Bush, I can't think of it.Nonetheless, despite the inherent pleasure in being contrary and attacking conventional wisdom, Itake no pleasure in saying that 30 Rock just isn't that funny for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to like the show; I SHOULD like the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find the humor too broad, the acting too cartoonish and thesituations both too knowing and too dumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, Alec Baldwin finds genuine humor in his role asthe suit and I can usually find something to make me smile in every episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's certainly a smartshow made by smart people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even watching again Emmy-honored episodes like the CarrieFisher guest spot or Baldwin getting all ghetto in Tracy Morgan's therapy session can't compare tothe heart of say The Office or the stronger, more believable ensemble on How I Met Your Mother Season 3 ($39.98; Fox).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That show is a solid comedy that's found its signature by reveling in complicated flashbacks and an ensemble that feels like a family, the way so many of the bestsitcoms seem to do. (And Neil Patrick Harris was robbed at the Emmys, but the rest of the gangelevates their material just as much.) 30 Rock follows in the tradition of shows I've loved from The Dick Van Dyke Show to The Mary Tyler Moore Show to Buffalo Bill and NewsRadio, so I'll keep tuning in every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's no big deal: Fey's got the world on a string -- she doesn'tneed me too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So tell me, what do you think of Tina Fey?

Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm losing faith in Shyamalan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctor Who? Doctor Who -- The BBC's Doctor Who has been an enduring fixture for decades, with countless mini-dramas behind the scenes as they transitioned from one Doctor to the next or fought with the BBC to increase their paltry special effects budget from 5 pounds an episode to ten pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctor Who: The Trial Of A Time Lord ($59.98; BBC Video) captures one of those defining moments, this one from the mid-80s when a driving creative force behind the series at the time conceived of a grand trial of the Doctor (for crimes he had committed and crimes hewould commit in the future) but died in the middle of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans will debate the 14 part resultendlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also just out is the single disc Doctor Who: The Brain of Morbius ($24.98; BBC Video), which contains one four-part adventure and lots of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But really, this is no way to handle sucha cumbersome, long-running show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I continue to wish the BBC would stop dribbling out all theseboxed sets and single discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're so bulky and poorly organized that it would take practically anentire library just to stock them on your shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely the only logical approach to this massiveseries is to give definitive boxed sets with the complete adventures of each Doctor in as compactand inexpensive a package as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Masters Of Cinema -- I can't quite rank special effects genius Ray Harryhausen with Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, but he's as pioneering as Welles and certainly as entertaining as Hitchcock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Harryhausen, the only auteurist special effects guy (as Leonard Maltin has said),we get two releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ray Harryhausen Collectible Gift Set ($80.95; Sony) has three previously available deluxe editions of Earth Vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Flying Saucers, 20 Million Miles To Earth and It Came From Beneath The Sea .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real draw here is a wonderfully fiercesome collectible figurine of the monster Ymir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great-looking, but surely a creature like this connected to Harryhausen shouldbe "posable" (Is that a word? I mean jointed like GI Joe so you could move it around) so fans could "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

(It's not clear on the DVD because most versions are different from the original studio-led theatrical release, so the usual warning about changes to the format weren't a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently, the proper Welles version is a little boxier, but Universal was worried that people with plasma and LCD screens wouldn't like that so they cropped off some of the image on the top and the bottom to make the movie MORE letterboxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this wasn't so tragic, I'd laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For decades, studios chopped up movies because they insisted people hated the black bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they ADD black barsbecause they think people want movies to be more letterboxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What people really want is to seethe movies the way the filmmaker intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shame on Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How long do we have to wait for yet another DVD release that will get it right? Animation: From Disney To Cartman -- Any Disney animated movie not named The Black Cauldron is usually referred to in a knee-jerk fashion as a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldn't say that about Sleeping Beauty ($29.99; Disney), however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film is presented in the widescreen format it was originally intended with some fine extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But to me, it's clearly second-tier Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though it's described as Disney's most expensive animated film to date, that certainly isn't demonstrated onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In classics like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio , every inch of every frame is alive with subtle touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Sleeping Beauty, cheap work-arounds are just as prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lookat the opening scenes where the three good fairies and one evil one come to bless the new babyprincess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grand scene of a castle's fairest and finest is merely a painted, unmoving backdrop -even courtiers and banners aren't animated but just stiffly pose in one position with only thecentral two or three people on screen even moving at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the same labor-saving device used oncartoons like The Flintstones and to me it's a blot on the entire film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, "I Wonder" is a nicely unconventional tune and the final battle ain't bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all fine for kiddies, but not nearlyimaginative enough to deserve the title of "classic." The Simpsons do, and their Eleventh Season ($49.98; Fox) finds the show still in relatively top form and the set is loaded with the extras fanshave come to expect from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you didn't buy the single volume sets of Speed Racer that came out recently, you're in luck: Speed Racer: The Complete Classic Collection ($49.98; Lionsgate) has a nifty Mach 5 design (albeit one too bulky to fit on most shelves) and every episode along withsome extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is how they should have released the show in the first place -- not in thosemodest, single volume sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It remains an intriguingly sober series for one essentially geared tokids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speed Racer The Next Generation: Fast Track ($19.98; Lionsgate) shows how hard that tone is to recapture, even with a plot ripped off of Tron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Care Bears Flurries Of Fun ($26.98; Fox)repacakges three individual DVDs filled with the fluffiest, tamest fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Smurfs Season OneVolume Two ($26.98; Warner Bros.) seems positively subversive in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in comparison to that, You're Not Elected Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving ($19.98; Warner Bros.) seem like sophisticated arthouse fare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, there's always the foul-mouthed, closeted Cartman, who is celebrated in The Cult of Cartman: Revelations ($26.98; Paramount), which contains 12 notably vulgar episodes of South Park focused on Cartman along with Life Lessons proferred by Cartman himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monsters Vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Munsters -- They came out at the same time and after a very brief popularity flamed out in just two season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, I've always considered The Addams Family to be the "smart" version of your friendly neighborhood monster when compared to The Munsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is splitting hairs since both are low-brow comedies of the most obvious sort, enlivened only verymodestly by fine actors like Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster and John Astin as Gomez Addams.The Munsters: The Complete Series ($69.98; Universal) is a nicely thorough compilation for thosewho care, including every episode, two TV movies, the unaired pilot and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In The Mood -- I think being in the right mood to see a particular movie is an under-appreciated Cars Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Bank Of America War Wire Video Financial Crisis MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

(But at least I tried.) Indeed, the movie was everything I feared -- as unconventional and surprising as The Station Agent was, this one embraced every cliche and took the most obvious route possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure what offended me more: the idea of a college professor having a gigantic, empty spare apartment in New York City (dude, I could really use that place) or the absurd suggestion that a man who found strangers illegally living in his home would immediately rush outside to find them and invite them back in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a man so closed off to his feelings since his wife had died, that was a pretty remarkable moment early in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And couldn't they have offered at least SOME excuse for this fantastic event? Maybe it could at least have been raining or the woman could have been visibly pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just give me some reason to forgive the essential plot twist that a man would find two people in his home and ask them to stay for as long as they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly, it boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, the young couple aren't so much illegal immigrants as cultural exchange ambassadors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a sexy and handsome drummer in a jazz trio and she's abeautiful artist who creates jewelry and the such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The anger over their illegal status is heavy-handed and trite ("He's a good person!" thunders our hero at one point) and the symbolic finale istoo much to bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many others enjoyed this movie more than me and it's certainly not incompetentin the vein of The Happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you better be in the right mood to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, apparently,that mood will never come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Open Mind And An Open Heart -- Perhaps the best way to bridge cultural differences in the world is to learn more about each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The US, of course, dominates pop culture around the world with its movies and TV shows and music and books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two modest DVDs give us glimpses intothe rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sufi Soul: The Mystic Music Of Islam ($19.95; Riverboat) is a fine, if brief look at the music of the followers of Sufi, the most tolerant and celebratory strand of Islam whichdominates in Senegal and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hosted and written by the excellent travel writer WilliamDalrymple, we meet and learn and especially see performances by artists like Rahat Fateh AliKhan, Mercan Dede, Abida Parveen and (briefly) the great Youssou N'Dour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 50 minutes long,the documentary film does include extras with complete performances that last another 36minutes, though given the capacity of the DVD it's a shame that it isn't twice as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothingelse, the movie will send you to the world music section of your music store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more barebonesis the travel documentary The Sacred Sites of the Dalai Lamas: A Pilgrammage To The OracleLake ($24.95; Michael Wiese).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's one in a series of films traveling to parts of Tibet and elsewhere that are prominent in the hearts of those who practice Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: Lou Reed: Berlin ($24.95; Weinstein/Genius), the concert film of his underappreciated song cycle; Mobile ($39.99; Acorn), a British miniseries that proves Michael Kitchen is more than just Foyle's War but can't overcome a so-so story any more than the next actor; Mission: Impossible Fifth Season ($49.99; Paramount) finds Lesley Ann Warren joining the IMF; The Three Stooges Collection Volume Four 1943-1945 ($24.96; Sony), which collects the slapstick that kept people smiling through the end of WW II, even as Curly suffered strokes and became incapacitated; Body Heat ($28.99; Warner Bros.) is so steamy on Blu-Ray you'll try to wipe the sweat off your TV screen even as you shy away from Kathleen Turner's man-eatingbrilliance; Halloween ($24.95; Dimension/Genius) is a 3 disc set of the Rob Zombie remake which unfortunately does not contain the original theatrical cut but only his unrated director's cut, a discof extras and ANOTHER disc with a 280 minute (!) making-of documentary that must set somesort of record for one movie; Mister Roberts ($24.99; Acorn) is an ok TV movie version starringRobert Hays and Charles Durning and Kevin Bacon of the classic play filmed more famously byHenry Fonda and Jack Lemmon; Cesar Millan: Mastering Leadership Vol. 1-3 ($49.99; R2) is theTV host's guide to dog whispering your pet; time hasn't been overly kind to Beetlejuice ($19.98; Warner Bros.) which seems less anarchic and more sitcomy today but still has to be one of MichaelKeaton's shinier moments; Hell In A Cell ($34.95; WWE) contains 15 complete pro wrestlingmatches, with Mick Foley talking you through the highlights; The Alice Faye Collection Volume 2Michael Giltz: DVDs: It's Tina Fey's World... http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-its-tina-feys-world_b_133697.html [4/5/2009 1:23:08 PM] Michelle Obama's Clothing Has Sean Hannity All Out OfSorts RICHARD POPLAWSKI,Pittsburgh Gunman, Kills 3Police Officers Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rachel Ehrenfeld: DoesIran Harbor Osama binLaden?
