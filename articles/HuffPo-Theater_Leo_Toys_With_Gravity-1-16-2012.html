But of course your attention would soon wander if Wegner wasn't a gifted vaudeville act and circus-trained acrobat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the subtlest pleasure comes from the fact that when Wegner is doing something that seems gravity-defying on the video, he's actually performing something quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when he looks casual, it's an effect that takes a tremendousamount of effort.Just when Wegner has exhausted the possibilities, the piece ups the ante.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First he adds "props" bymaking chalk drawings on the wall, then they add animation by Ingo Panke that can only be seen on thevideo projection and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a tight, very clever sixty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a critic who gets to see shows, it's a delightful way to spend an evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a show in a fringe festival, it must have seemed like manna from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I don't think the show is stretched out to its one hour length -- Wegner and director Daniel Briere never flag in their invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it is juuuust long enough for that slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a practical level, I would much prefer for audiences that this piece was kept at say 45 minutes and combined with one or two other similar acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this were shorter and paired with similarly bold and entertaining works it would make a truly outstanding evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And properly marketed you could keep theshowcase fresh by replacing one act at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, my guest enjoyed it much more thanme and has already recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully adventurous audiences will discover this off-beat gemand enjoy it on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's that Fred Astaire number if you don't know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Bonnie &amp;
