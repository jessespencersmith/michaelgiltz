The group sing-along at the beginning was lip-synced which is disconcerting and wildly out of whack with everything the show stands for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it just impossible to get 24 people to rehearse and perform a songdecently? If so, don't do one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allison Iraheta sang her single "Scars" with a good amount of style, provingthis young singer could still develop into a real artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kris Allen did a cover of the Beatles classic "Let It Be" (quite a good one) while footage showed him visiting Haiti. (The song is a benefit single available on iTunes.) By the way, his new tune "Live Like We're Dying" just broke into the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it sits at #19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Kris's benefit single isn't just pro forma niceness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If people buy the "Let It Be" cover and ignore his hit, that could stalland never make the Top 10, not to mention weaken the album in the eyes of some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you're a fan, buyboth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the acts saying goodbye performed one last time and reinforced the idea that no mistakes had been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, some of them deserved to hang around for another few weeks -- there were certainly worse performers -- but none of them seemed destined for the top 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tyler was especially stupid in blaming the judges for his early exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Way to blow any good will you might have, Tyler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd studied the Facebook and Twitter rankings of the contestants to see if that could indicate strong grassroots support...and it was a bust at predicting who would go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, John Park's hugeonline following is one indication of why the worst performer of the week gets another shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: American Idol Dedicates Thursday's Show To Haiti "American Idol" has teamed up with the United Nations Foundation to benefit Haiti on its Feb. 25 show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the broadcast, "Idol" winner KrisAllen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lilly Scott, Denver's American Idol Semifinalist, Keeps Singing (VIDEO) (Scroll down for video) LOS ANGELES -- "American Idol" semifinalist Lilly Scott is right where she belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 20-year-old singer fromDenver was among a...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clay Aiken Talks Gay Rights, Family's Reaction To His Coming Out RALEIGH, N.C. — More than a year after disclosing he is gay, Clay Aiken is speaking before a gay-rights event in his hometown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aiken will...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Lambert Dishes On Donning Corsets And Shoulder Cages (VIDEO)If Adam Lambert had to describe his style in three words, they'd be "glam," "chic," and "playful," the singer told Pop Couture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He talked about...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More News Posts: « First Prev 1 2 Next Last » More in Entertainment... 1 of 5 Sinéad O'Connor Some Burning Questions for the Pope Billie Jean King Repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Is a Big DealDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS demi lovato heidi montag sugery scars lindsay lohan nude miley cyrus lap dance video teen mom More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com John Boehner Strikes Back Against Sarah Palin Comments (2,672) PHOTOS: Rare Lunar Eclipse Seen From Around The World Comments (71) Lindsay Lohan Snuck Out of Rehab for Alcohol, Worker Says READ MORE Bus Fire Snuffs Out Kings of Leon Show in London READ MORE Ryan Gosling and MichelleWilliams (Coyly) Deny They're Dating READ MORE Ginnifer Goodwin: I've Been Dieting Since I Was 9 Eliza Dushku Helps Child Soldiers 50 Cent's Home Burglarized by Two MenComments 43 Pending Comments 0View FAQ 140 Fans 59 Fans 304 Fans 125 Fans 0 Fans 114 FansI agree about the girl who warbled, "I want to hold your hand".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just shows who's voting doesn't it? I really am starting to believe those who accuse the show of being rigged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also think that as time goes by--Simon will have a heart attack while listening to Ellen sum things up with "your adorable" comments! Love Ellen on Ellen but here she is becoming the joke herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I only watched the 2 shows of the 24 perform and no pre Hollywood shows but cannot watch anymorebecause it's really low brow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There;s absolutely no reason to think the show is rigged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too many times to count where a really popular contestant didn't make the cut, one that the show was clearly supporting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last season they clearly wanted Alison v Adam and clearly wanted Adam to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But ultimately they don't care who wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all makes good tv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This early on, the people who stay are just the ones with a strong built in fanbase via family friends, some particular appeal (like faith or ethnicity or region).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This early on, a determined small town voting hard canmake the difference in keeping you alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon made the comment to that one singer that they made the right decisionwhen they left him out of the top 24 the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I want to know, is....how isit that somebody who can't sing even got that close? Everything is HellWood is rigged babe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What kind of drama could the show fabricate if everyone gave his/her best performanc e this early? Come on, folks, it's TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't compete music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kids need to grow up and appreciate music and stop seeing it as competitio n.TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 Lindsay Lohan in Battery Investigation Bret Michaels Engaged Tracy Morgan's Life-Saving Surgery MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Lisa Murkowski Government Shutdown Careers College Basketball Foreclosures Royalty HIV/AIDS Sarah Palin ChristmasHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESRecency | Popularity Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 total) catcancook 10:16 AM on 3/01/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 06:09 PM on 3/01/2010 Permalink | Share it CAMBEL 03:54 PM on 3/02/2010 Permalink | Share it SILVANUS 04:07 PM on 3/04/2010 Permalink | Share it dantcomedy 04:38 AM on 3/01/2010 Permalink | Share it curiousasheck 09:42 PM on 2/28/2010 Permalink | Share itRyan Reynolds Says Scarlett Johansson 'Treated Him Badly': Report 360 Comments PHOTOS: Heidi Montag's Plastic Surgery Scars: Bald Spots, Uneven Boobs, Lumpy Legs 537 Comments My Lunch With Jane Fonda 2 Comments Heidi Montag's 10 Plastic Surgery Procedures: Before &amp; After PHOTOS 663 Comments PHOTOS: Paris Hilton Dons Leather Bodysuit 154 Comments WATCH: Natalie Portman Strips Down In Trailer For Movie With James Franco 22 CommentsComments are closed for this entry View All Favorites 59 Fans 164 Fans 139 Fans 6 Fans 9 Fans Well, there's a long history of talent shows and talent searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ella Fitzgerald broke out via the Apollo's Amateur Night, along with countless other great artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, you name a"winner" but as Idol has proven repeatedly it's not a zero sum game where one person winsand everyone else loses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite Simon's insistence that you should be a killer and not rootfor anyone else, the truth is that many of the people in the Top 12 get a genuine shot at acareer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As long as you shine, you don't have to feel jealous or worry about someone elseshining as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So don't think of Idol as a competitio n so much as a change for a dozen people to take advantage of a huge platform and develop their artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My suggestion for simplifyin g the process: 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Make Crystal Bowersox and Casey James the finalists right now. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First episode: Let them have one show where they each get to play what they think are their three best songs with either their own bands or solo, whichever they are more comfortabl e with, in their entirety, Take a vote 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second episode: They each play cover versions of three songs selected for them by the judges (preferabl y the same song for each of them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take a vote. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third Episode: Review the performanc es and announce the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Done. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winner gets to record a combinatio n of covers and originals. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loser has to record horrible Clive Davis produced drivel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They really need to ix-nay the group numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if it isn't lip synched, there is no way to select a song that will suit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week's opening group number reminded me of watching TheBrady Bunch Kids lumber around the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three of the best performers , Crystal Bowersox, Alex Rodriguez and Casey James looked genuinely mortified to be conscripte d into that choreograp hed mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For God's sake, they're not auditionin g for a Bob Fossee show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Srop subjecting them, and us, to this torture! Ashley looked P.O.d at the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am disappoint ed to read that John Park has such a huge following - a big voice that has not impressed thus far but certainly not worthy of a huge following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But everything in life is a popularity contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is going to be one boring season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's only 3 girls with good voices and oh gee whiz, who is AT&amp;T going to pick as the winner this year? No point in watching and your votes will not matter.MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POSTHUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 03:02 AM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it kirtlandpat 08:30 PM on 2/28/2010 Permalink | Share it BlueKansas 01:48 PM on 2/28/2010 Permalink | Share it anonimost 09:49 PM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST COMMUNITY MODERATOR SadieGirl 07:07 PM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it 125 Fans 0 Fans 25 Fans 59 Fans 21 Fans 14 FansThere are some good voices and sweet kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Original?

They're on American idol, that's their chance! FFS!!! Dotwall, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course I critiqued their performanc es, but I also point out repeatedly that playing with a band for the first time is a big adjustment , not to mention a huge audience, millions on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even just using an earpiece is a new thing to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I say that all the time as an explanatio n for why performanc es are shaky this early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheles s, you gotta compare one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Jermaine, I hope he does better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love gospel music of all sorts and Aretha is one of the greats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her live album AmazingGrace is one of my favorites (as is the film, Say Amen Somebody, which introduced me toa host of artists).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But good gospel singing is just like good pop singing: indulgent runs andtrills divorced from the melody can be awfully self-indul gent and boring to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't dislike runs, but way too many young artists start vamping like Mariah Carey before they'veeven sung the melody once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And riffs and runs are easy to do but very hard to do well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to know why the AI has vocal coaches and stylists when they repeatedly send these young singers out with "the wrong song choice" and either dowdy or un-hip clothing? I agree that the young singers need to look more hip - that Katielyn looked like a caberet singer, for heaven's sake.I get annoyed with the poor song choices - maybe AI needs better vocal coaches to guide the contestant s and help them find their style and image more effectivei y and sooner. vocal coaches coach them on the VOCALS, thus the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are NOT allowed to get any input on song choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta' s father was banned from rehersals and some segments of the show for just that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of the reason they do not allow them to getinfluence is to see what kind of ideas they have as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are majorly controlled inmost areas of the competitio n, but not in song or clothing choices, it's all a test.SILVANUS 04:22 PM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it dotwall 03:39 PM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it marred 06:56 PM on 2/28/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 06:15 PM on 3/01/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER mlrlmsw 04:14 AM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it Burnsey 10:29 AM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it59 Fans 381 Fans 59 Fans 43 Fans 59 FansI'm not quite sure about that Burnsey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do know that family and friends often make song choice selections .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta' s dad was reportedly banned for interferin g or making a nuisance beyond what was allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no objection to family or friends giving input on anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The artists can talk to them on the phone at thevery least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure the behind the scenes folk do sometimes talk an artist intosomething they shouldn't do and other times can't talk the artist out of somethingthey think is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burnsey is definitely right that ultimately it does comedown to the artist themselves .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They aren't puppets and must make the final choice themselves .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to know more about the process of back and forth but they don't want to pull back the curtain and spoil the mystery, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only 4 contestant s left.....2 girls...2 guys...the rest is fluff and best watched with the sound down or muted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worst year of ratings ever...bet cha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ain't that the way it usually is? Four interestin g performers -- which include Crystal Bowersox and Casey James, I assume -- will make for a good top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first summer season had much lower ratings of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's had an episode or two that were the lowest in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will show the usual soft decline and still be the #1 show in the country.That's almost inevitable since it's already dealt with the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means Idol will be#1 for six years in a row which has never happened before in history. (Actually, no showhas been #1 for six years either in a row or or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll have to wait till 2012 for a bigdecline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's when Idol will start episodes in January just after the brand new X Factorhas had its grand finale in the fall of 2011 right before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I dunno, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In seasons past, I've picked out favorites during the selection process - Clay, forone, who I recall telling a friend that you "can't believe" the voice on that nerdy looking kid with theglasses and big ears; I told her I thought he had a great shot at winning - even though eventually aswe all know, he didn't, but still - I was rooting for him among the top 24; ditto that Lambert kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year it's hard to nail a favorite from the selection process, though I think the unlikely oddities are again my favorites - such as Lilly, Crystal and Siobhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey, yeah, for his looks and persona- his voice is nice, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However - the real test will be if those I mentioned above can hack the different genres that AI requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I noticed that Crystal (the sweet faced dred-locks child) seemed truly out of place among the other "Glee-like " robots, dancing and emoting for the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just not her thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does she, by chance, write her own songs? And if so, are they any good? She may not make it far on AI, buthopefully, if she is a singer/son gwriter and not just "another coffee house singer" as Simon pointed out, she can carve out a place for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal does apparently write her own songs though I've no idea if they're any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldlike to be more enthusiast ic about people and right now I'm just glad when they're not out and out bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have a point.HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 06:18 PM on 3/01/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER porsche996 06:02 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:38 AM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it Charity 03:18 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 05:27 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it304 Fans 59 Fans 8 Fans 42 FansI have to say, and I'm a little shocked, but I'm not enjoying Ellen as a judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the rare occaisions when Paula would crawl out from under whatever fog she was in, she at least knew somethingabout music. ellen so far has shockingly enough been wasted air for me, and in fact, as somebodywho has always liked her, I find myself getting resentful when she takes up time trying to joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thekids already have to trim the songs way down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm really not sure what is going to happen to theshow when Simon Leaves. his comment to the one singer, with the harmonica who was actingsomewhat snotty of "There are 10,000 girls just like you doing the exact same thing in coffeehous es all over the country" was just what she needed to hear to up her game and I don't think a judge likeEllen has it in her to give actual constructi ve criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought Ellen would be better right off the bat given her track record in live TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she'sreally only had three nights so far. (In Hollywood Week, the judges mostly talk off camerawith each other to keep the suspense high.) I always think I could do it but it's much harderthan it looks and Ellen does look a bit like the new kid at school, sitting at the end of thelunch table and trying to fit in while the other kids joke around with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So just likethe kids, I'm hoping/exp ecting she'll become more pointed and succinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By nature, however, I think she is more of a Paula type cheerleade r than a slap in the face person like Simon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His comment to Crystal was indeed a useful moment for her, though I liked thatperformanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She does write her own songs though I've no idea if they're any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she is an early favorite of mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you're right, we need a few more to step up to make anexciting show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I had the inclinatio n, I'd time the loooong boring commentary by the four (three was the perfect number) judges and add that to the endless commercial s and come up with what? ten minutes of actual singing?I like Ellen, too, but not here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She and Kara add nothing but noise to this process.I was an early fan of AI, but actually flipped channels for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think theshark has been jumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bring back Paula There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Who knew last night's results show could top the boys' performanc e night on the badness scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are people confusing Tim Urban with Keith Urban somehow? Would he still be around if his lastname was Kowolski ? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group lip-synch was surreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somebody at "Idol" obviously figured they'd sell more iTunes if they went the "Glee" studio route, rather than revealing how bad they could sound live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either that,or they tried it live and it was such a trainwreck , they figured we have to sweeten this in the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either that, or drop the group performanc es altogether .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael thought Allen's version of "Let It Be" was "quite good"?? Seriously? Ray Charles did a"quite good" cover of the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So did Joe Cocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That about covers the "quite good" covers.There's a reason John Lennon asked McCartney during the recording of it if the rest of the band should "giggle" during the solo tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Lennon explained, it could have (should have) been done by Wings, and was McCartney' s Herculean effort to craft his very own "Bridge Over Troubled Waters".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He succeeded all too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an insipid tune, which was revealed in all its insipidnes s by the lightweigh t craftsmans hip of Kris Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One imagines after that performanc e that the Haiti Relief Fund was left pondering, "Haven't we endured enough?".CAMBEL 02:55 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 05:25 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it wakupmagy 11:39 AM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 01:33 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it43 Fans 59 Fans 2 Fans 59 Fans 14 FansSpot on, filmex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps young Urban had the "cute" non-threat ening factor going for him with the young girls who furiously vote, because surely his performanc e was far worse than Tyler's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Urban does have cuteness on his side, never a small thing when battling for fans on Idol or the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought John Park was the worst of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the order ofwho gets dismissed when isn't that important as long as the people you thinkbelong in the Top 4 stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who cares if Urban is dumped next week or threeweeks from now or even makes the Top 10? What matters is that the people youthink are really talented go far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for "Let It Be," it's way down on my list offavorite Paul McCartney songs (as is "Hey Jude"), especially the syrupy stringversion that Phil Spector imposed on it which even Paul didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's still agood tune and all I said was that Kris was quite good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't say it was amasterpiec e or brilliant or stunning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A good not great song given a quite good performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as for "Bridge," that's a would-be anthem I think really does work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again, there are many Paul Simon songs I love more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Discussing the merits of Let It Be as a compositio n is inane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But all subjectivi ty aside, your claim that LIB was Paul's attempt at his own version of Bridge Over TroubledWater is beyond laughable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An extraordin arily great trick pulled off by Paul, apparently , as LIB was recorded in Jan. 1969, months *before* BOTW! Damn, DCDan, well pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm a fool for not giving that a moment of thought.I'm sure he could argue he was just using "Bridge" as shorthand for any inspiringpop song with gospely overtones and a big finale, but still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It starts out just as crappy every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I read the same statements every year at the start of thecompetitio n, but as they said last night, for some of the contestant s it's the very first time they ever sang on a real stage, or in front of more than 20 people in a coffee house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it is proceedingjust as it always does, and no, it's not the worst season ever, and I doubt it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also thoughtthat it was hilarious when Tim sat down so fast, we thought it was because he wanted to sit beforethey could change their minds...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as for Tyler and his parting comments about the judges, I think he was spot on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His criticism that they did not say the things they did until it was too late to fix them was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just watch theclip of his "backstory " before he got voted off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All you got was people telling him how cool his look was, and praising his singing, very little critical input for him to take in, only then to be told his lookwas a gimmick and he needed to be more original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They told him he was groovy and hip up untilthey told him he wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He got no constructi ve criticism until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I appreciate d the honesty of his statement, and the fact that it didn't appear to be said maliciousl y, but as a simple statement of fact.Charity 03:06 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 05:31 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it DCDan 08:18 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:42 AM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it Burnsey 11:28 AM on 2/26/201059 Fans 304 Fans 9 FansI agree 100% with your comments about the early live performanc e shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People don't appreciate what a completely new experience it is to perform with a live band in front of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's amazing is how quickly some of them take to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just using theear piece for a rhythm track or to hear your own vocals is off-puttin g and strange and hard to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Tyler's comments, I do agree with you and him that from the edited comments we saw he got a bum deal: you're cool, love the Seventies vibe, go home! But as far as publicimage is concerned, blaming the judges was not a smart move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He could be honest withthem off camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And more to the point, the constructi ve criticism of the judges is rarely that helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They often contradict each other and themselves from week to week, as Isometimes try to point out (like telling Andrew Garcia he should have done something like"Straight Up" -- rework a tune unexpected ly -- when that was exactly what he had just done).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could go crazy just trying to follow their advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately , you've got vocal coaches and arrangers and family and friends and advisers backstage who are far moreinstrument al in what you do than the judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd blame them if I thought there was something to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally , I thought he was fine and a little surprised he left early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meh, public image really doesn't matter to these ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody remembers thepeople who only made it to the top 24 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges are not responsibl e for Tyler's horrific signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No amount of constructi ve criticism would ever help that boy become a good singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2010 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:01 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it CAMBEL 02:52 PM on 2/26/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST COMMUNITY MODERATOR SadieGirl 07:16 PM on 2/27/2010 Permalink | Share it Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 total)</p>
