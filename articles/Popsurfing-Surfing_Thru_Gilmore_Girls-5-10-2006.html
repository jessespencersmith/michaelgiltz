                <p>W E D N E S D AY, M AY 1 0 , 2 0 0 6Surfing Thru "Gilmore Girls"Satisfying and yet annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husbandDaniel clearly poured their heart and souls into this season finale(which almost counts as a series finale since they won't be back).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthey delivered a solid, well-written, well-acted, well-directed show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sowhy the hell has the series been so spotty and even lackluster the lasttwo years? Nice openers and closers, nice bit of whimsy (the crush ofstreet musicians) that was kept properly in the background as just lightfiller rather than being a major storyline the way they've been indulgingthemselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One off moment: Emily Gilmore saying Christopher andthe woman she hoped to set him up with looked like a shampoo ad.Huh? And Emily should be a little more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's not a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rory'sscene with Logan's dad was also very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of being acartoonish villain who won't even visit his potentially dying son in thehospital, he's very reasonable and direct. (Making Rory -- who's been apill -- look more like a fool than ever.) And if these plot twists wereGENUINE plot twists, I'd be very satisfied indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're notgenuine plot twists: they're just artificial stumbling blocks until theshow ends right where we know they expect it to end -- with Luke andLorelai together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rory is almost unrecognizable -- bitching to Logan'sfather instead of just being polite and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is she really angrythat Logan's family expects to spend time with him on his collegegraduation day and the night before he leaves for London? That'sabsurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She chose not to be with them (understandably) but thenwaiting for him is the price you pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why is this smart, witty,independent girl behaving like a floozie -- she's part of Logan's emptyworld instead of helping him escape it, which is what he always wanted.She hangs out with his friends, drinks a lot, and throws a big dumbparty hours before he goes away instead of arranging to spend everyminute with him alone? Dressed up in a costume, inviting tons ofpeople you barely know, drinking away -- this is Rory? Nice final tearyscene, though.And frankly, I wish in a way Luke and Lorelai would break up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothingthat happened made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lorelai opens her heart to Luke and hekeeps saying he has to think about his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How could he possiblythink marrying the woman he was DYING to be with would harm orinterfere with his relationship with his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, a week or twoNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Surﬁng Thru "Gilmore Girls"http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/05/surﬁng-thru-gilmore-gir... 1 of 37/29/09 12:57 AMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SAaronMichael in New YorkBiboy POPSURFING.COM: Surﬁng Thru "Gilmore Girls"http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/05/surﬁng-thru-gilmore-gir... 2 of 37/29/09 12:57 AMPOPSURFING.COM: Surﬁng Thru "Gilmore Girls"http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/05/surﬁng-thru-gilmore-gir... 3 of 37/29/09 12:57 AM</p>
