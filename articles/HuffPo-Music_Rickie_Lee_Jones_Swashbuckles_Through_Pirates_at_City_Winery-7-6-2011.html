Lots of reasons and all of them makesense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One, it's a rebellion against the shuffle mode on music MP3 players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two, it makes a concert special, not just a random selection of a few new tracks, some greatest hits and a a handful of obscurities and covers like so many shows in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three, it reestablishes the album as an art form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great that digital music allows artists to release EPs and singles whenever the mood strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the idea that the album is dead is just silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creating a groupof songs meant to be heard in a certain order at one sitting has been around for decades. (I nominateFrank Sinatra as one of the first to pioneer and certainly perfect the idea.) Just because singles arehappily back in fashion doesn't mean the album is over, any more than the fact that a new market FOLLOW US September 15, 2011 9 Signs Your Husband Is GAY, According To...PHOTOS: Kirstie Alley Makes Her Runway Debut Christina Ricci At Alexander Wang: Hit Or Miss?Keira Knightley: Sexually Dangerous EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like 43 Posted: 7/6/11 01:38 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES CONNECT FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT TECH MEDIA LIFE &amp; STYLE CULTURE COMEDY HEALTHY LIVING WOMEN LOCAL MORE Like 40KTelevision Mad Men Jersey Shore Scarlett Johansson Smarter Ideas More Log inopening up for short stories would mean novels were permanently passe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a treat for fans with Jones -- getting over the flu and laughingly telling us she was on speed or wouldn't have been able to make it -- first performing Pirates and then her eponymous debut, by and large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show began creakily with 15 minutes of footage from her new DVD Rickie Lee Jones -- Live In Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was random footage when at least they might have played some complete songs they anticipated would NOT be performed in the concert we were about to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it would have been nice ifthis was screened before the 8 p.m. start time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe only Rickie Lee Jones could open up for Rickie Lee Jones but this promo should not have delayed the start of the concert, which is how it felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, the concert is blessedly low on quick-cutting, Jones is in fine form and it has a healthy dose of more than 2 and a half hours of content overseen by director Ian McCrudden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After that, the show proper began at 8:30 but it was not smooth sailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two songs in, Jones wondered what the next number was on Pirates she was due to perform. "Skeletons!" numerous people shouted out hopefully. "'Skeletons' it is," she answered gamely, going on to deliver a sad little story about breaking upwith a guy who left her in a house filled with fan mail where she wrote this tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones fiddled with the sound, dealt with an annoying audience member who insisted on trying to talk directly to Jones but cutting him to the quick with a choice curse word (though unfortunately the schmuck will probably dine out on the tale for years), directed the band, grooved to her excellent horn section, told a rambling disjointed tale about being arrested on July 4th in 1970 and generally cut adistinctive, strong-willed figure as an artist not quite feeling it that night but still delivering the goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are you done eating, she asked early on, since City Winery serves meals, encouraging fans to arrive early and eat up long before the show begins. "Finish up!" she said half amusingly, half commandingly. "I don't like to sing for people who are eating." Who would? Telling a story about getting arrested at the borderfor not wearing a bra (so she says) led right into a righteous version of her signature first hit "Chuck E.'sIn Love" and a string of tunes from that stellar debut. it may be easier to celebrate those early successes since her most recent album Balm In Gilead was a distinct return to form I considered one of the best albums of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No need to rest on her laurels for Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a lingering bug, her voice was its usual distinctive affair, with Jones playing with her distance from the microphone to dramatic effect, especially when bringing the band to silence andhypnotizing the crowd with her sung-spoken lyrics at the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone without her classic debut ormid-period masterpiece Flying Cowboys (I'd love to attend the show when she performs that on July 6 or 7th at City Winery ) is missing out on some great work by a genuine original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while this concert was not one for the ages, no one would ever accuse the crankily alive Jones ofsleepwalking through a set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was present and accounted for, even if her fans didn't always give her thequiet attention she deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

They made an announcement at the beginning, but no waiters or waitresses interfered as patrons repeatedly lifted their cell phones into the air and took picture after picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if the flash is off (and it wasn't always), no artist wants to sing to a cell phone and the cameras are incredibly distracting to everyone sitting behind those clueless shutterbugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, if I were an artist, I'd encourage everyone to whip out their phones and cameras and FlipVideos and say, "Okay,take all the images you want during this first song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go crazy! Then put them all away for the rest of theshow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alright?"
