Read More: Demetri Martin , Entertainment News How easily a film can be misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ken Loach's The Wind That Shakes The Barley tackles the prickly subject of British troopsoccupying Ireland and the men and women whorise up to fight against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a British subject(born in Bermuda) with Irish blood who hasspent most of his life in America, I can see allsides to the conflict and be dispassionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butalmost no one in England or Ireland can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few scenes of British soldiers mocking and belittling Irish men caused outcries that the film was anti-British (often claimed by those who hadn't seen it), even though they're balanced byanother scene where a British soldier describes his despair and pain at the situation they're in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lost in the shuffle is the quiet, heartbreaking film itself, which follows two brothers (one played by the eerily beautiful Cillian Murphy) who join the IRA in the early 1900s to fight against the Britishand then get drawn into the Irish Civil War of the Twenties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It won the top prize at Cannes in 2006and went on to be Loach's biggest box office hit to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since Loach's box office is invariablymodest and it barely made a ripple in the US even among critics, it deserves to be discovered againon DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There you will discover one of the film's painful, central truths: how violence corrupts and corrodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The violence begins with attacks on foreign soldiers occupying your country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then itspreads to killing Irish people you've never met who collaborate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then it spreads tokilling friends you've known all your life who cracked under torture and pain of death andsuddenly you find yourself pointing a gun at your own flesh and blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this undermines the political arguments at play in wanting the British gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just the way it goes - war is hell, even if the war is justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And violence is poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But seeing howviolence turns on you so quickly should give anyone pause about turning to it before all other Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

( I'm too lazyto read the book right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe in a year or so.) Usedtobequiet See Profile I'm a Fan of Usedtobequiet permalink There are so many movies that have changed me in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've beenwatching a lot of "foreign" films lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They can be so REAL, so truthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of late, here are a few thathave affected me deeply: Omagh - Ireland Osama -Afghanistan (no, it has nothing to do with "him") The Circle - Iran Blood Diamond was incredible in the way the scenes of war seemed so believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A heartbreaking movie that made me ache for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've always had a very deep level of respect for Leonardo DiCaprio,but this movie cemented that for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He obviously believed in what this film had to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For daysafterwards, I thought about war and brainwashing and how a young boy can lose his soul under theright circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, a great great American film that showed me how an "other" can see "us" is The Brother from Another Planet that John Sayles did starring Joe Morton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a side note, did you see Cillian in 28 Days Later? "Eerily beautiful" is a really great way to describe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the movie, EEK! Thanks for the reminder of The Wind that Shakes the Barley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I especially enjoyed the Iranian film The Circle as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remarkable that it even got made,frankly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldn't have thought of The Brother From Another Planet but of course you'reright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EspressoAtNoon See Profile I'm a Fan of EspressoAtNoon permalink I just added The Wind That Shakes The Barley to the top of my Blockbuster Queue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for thesuggestion, I can't wait to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hotel Rwanda made a big impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found myself thinking about that movie for weeks after I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others that made big impressions were The Killing Fields, In the Name of the Father, Sophie's Choice, and Life is Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG Computers India Barack Obama Michelle Obama Sports Olympics Housing Crisis Fox News MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

It was the moment when we realize that even though the two astronauts have done everything to keep their voices hidden fromHAL, the computer is lip reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the huge Cinerama screen plunged into sudden darkness tonote the intermission I was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The emotional impact of that stunning moment was sooverwhelming that, for the first time ever in a theater, I realized that a film could be something morethan mere entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film that changed my mind is probably 'Soldier Blue.' It's not a particularly great western, but the military attack on the peaceful Indian village - though overwrought - had such an impact, my wholepolitical attitude towards both the military - yesterdays and todays - and the plight of the nativeAmericans was turned inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps in an indirect way 'Soldier Blue' is responsible for my daily reading of the Huffington Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink 2001 certainly blew a lot of minds, but you're one of the few people that didn't talk about the light show at the end or the general stoner mind trip and focused on Kubrick's riveting (ifsometimes obscure) plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That moment when you realize HAL is lip-reading is indeed aclassic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the interesting thing about Soldier Blue is that you can have your mind changedeven by a film that won't necessarily stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Local 16mm Transfer High-end Conversion Process Limited time - 50% off www.digitaltransfersystems.net Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:28 AM on 09/06/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:25 AM on 09/06/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:02 PM on 09/05/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:24 AM on 09/06/2007</p>
