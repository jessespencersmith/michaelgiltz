That's the cheerful approach of Dexter: The First Season ($39.98; Showtime), the well-adjusted forensic specialist who does a little community service as adiscriminating serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only despair felt here is over actor Michael C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hall not getting an Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(Don't ask me why -- no matter how good colorization gets, the biggest fansfor old black and white movies and TV shows are precisely the same people who hate colorizationthe most.) The latest example is 1935's adventure tale She ($24.95; Kino), an otherwise marvelous restoration of this tale from the people behind King Kong .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't care if special effects whiz Ray Harryhausen was involved and old movies were sometimes tinted; there's no need to colorize thismovie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, they give you both versions, so you can focus on the better-than-ever print inglorious black and white when watching this Raiders -like tale of derring do in a subterranean kingdom Some people prefer a sunny disposition, so if all this despair has you down, there's always the cheery Ugly Betty Complete First Season ($59.99; Buena Vista).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this candy-colored bit of foolishness can't cheer you up, nothing will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, the show is best when focusing on Bettyand her real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've got the tone of a telenovela down pat -- they don't need the silly, over-the-top plots as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: South Park Complete Tenth Season ($49.99; Paramount), a series that hit its stride just a few years ago and is better than ever; Serenity Collector's Edition ($26.98; Universal), the terrifically fun spin-off of the TV series Firefly (maybe if we buy enough copies they'll make another movie); 1991's The Dark Backward Special Edition ($14.94; Sony), a comedy about a guy with a third arm that actually deserves to be called a cult classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Honor Roll: The Best Of College Football Vol. 1 and 2 ($19.95 each; ESPN) has one problem: at more than two hours each, they're still too short for the fans who will always want more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Blu-Ray Movies On Sale Pay securely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fast &amp; easy shipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huge selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Order now and save! www.amazon.com "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

I guess I'll go count on amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here they are in reverse chronological order: 1) 20th anniversery edition 2) Lenticular cover edition 3) el cheapo version (I think this is what I own) 4) criterion 5) another el cheapo version also found in 2 different robocop trilogy box sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Very true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like so many movies (especially sci-fi movies), Robocop has been repackaged endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon they'll put it out on Blu-Ray and /or HD-DVD as well and some poor schmuckwil have to buy it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I probably wouldn't have covered this umpteenth reissue if itdidn't tie into my despair theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least it's not Terminator 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's surely the wmostrepackaged title of all. jvarga See Profile I'm a Fan of jvarga permalink You're too late, I didn't include the blu ray and hd dvd versions available on amazonin my list :p CynAnne See Profile I'm a Fan of CynAnne permalink AIG Computers India Barack Obama Michelle Obama Sports Olympics Housing Crisis Fox News MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

It would be nice payback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mamet's film is House ofGames -- is that also the French name for Haneke's movie known as Cache in the US? That'sthe movie that is being remade in English -- a truly bizarre idea since it doesn't make senseas a movie outside of the French-Algerian context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I too found Irreversible deeply disturbing,but not offensively so -- a rape scene should be horrific and upsetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CynAnne See Profile I'm a Fan of CynAnne permalink ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I realized I'd confused the two afterward, Michael, and I can only plead the latehour causing my confusion of the titles/directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the time I did see, it was toolate to change it (that 'Edit Your Post' button we discussed in the other HuffPothread the other day would be most welcome at times like last night - wink, wink).And I agree with your assessment of Irreversible - I've seen all kinds of 'things thatgo bump in the night', cinematically speaking, but it's the horror of people who look normal and yet behave like monsters that I find so frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll take the zombie or sea monster any day over the smiling gentleman standing behind me with a pair of wickedly sharp scissors in his trenchcoat pocket, just waiting for 'his moment' - *shivers*..! ;) ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:14 AM on 08/22/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:40 PM on 08/22/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:50 AM on 08/23/2007</p>
