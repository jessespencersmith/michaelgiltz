Not so here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer and star Randy Noojin delivers one of the delights of the fest with his straight-forward, no-nonsense portrayal of singer, songwriter and activist Woody Guthrie in Hard Travelin' With Woody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directed neatly by Richard Mover, the show is framed by Woody performing at a union fundraiser in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noojin avoids imitationbut captures the spirit of Woody as he describes the mouthful of a name Woody had growing up(Woodrow Wilson Guthrie), his social awakening as a boom town goes bust when the oil dries up, hiswitnessing of the mistreatment of "Okies" in California and his aw-shucks approach to arguing for"sticking together" via unions, even as the people trying to unionize are beaten and killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story ispunctuated with Guthrie's many terrific numbers, which Noojin delivers with aplomb, getting even an FOLLOW USSeptember 15, 2011 Signs Your Husband Is GayKirstie Alley Walks NYFW The Alexander Wang PartyKnightley Gets Dangerous EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like 43 Posted: 8/18/11 05:27 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES CONNECT FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT TECH MEDIA LIFE &amp; STYLE CULTURE COMEDY HEALTHY LIVING WOMEN LOCAL MORE Like 40KTelevision Mad Men Jersey Shore Scarlett Johansson Smarter Ideas More Log inuptight New York crowd (not least of all me) singing along from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show reaches a dramatic peak when Guthrie is auditioning for the Rainbow Room in New York City and feels tempted by the lureof fame and fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of the show is descriptive and passionate, but this is the moment of realtheater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More scenes of genuine dramatic impact like that would have made this piece truly great. (And while the focus is on social justice, a delightful song or two Guthrie wrote for kids would have provided a useful break in the mood.) But this is solid, entertaining work that should travel far and wide in these hard times, just like Guthrie himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CIVILIAN ** out of **** Here's a play that should have hewed more closely to its title and description.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Civilian is described as a documentary drama about veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan "transitioning from soldier to college student to civilian." Would that it were so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps 90 percent of the show covers far morefamiliar territory -- why soldiers enlisted, donning that uniform for the first time, firing their weapon,coming under fire, getting wounded and killing the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those stories -- based on oral historiesrecorded at the University of Kentucky -- are no less gripping for being familiar, though here they arerarely shaped by playwright and director Herman Daniel Farrell III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, the 10 percent of the showthat does indeed focus on their life at home and on campus is far more fresh and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soldierswho don't enter a classroom without planning an exit strategy, soldiers who have a panic attack whenstudents "gang up" on a teacher, soldiers who get furious when a professor blithely dismisses U.S. troopsas murderers, soldiers disdainful of students who describe an upcoming exam as life or death -- all of thisis fairly uncharted territory and feels fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a pity so little of the show focuses on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the metatrappings of the show, such as having the actors rehearse their scenes and getting notes or having astudent veteran interrupt their rehearsal to complain about the oral histories being turned into a play,serve no useful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why is one of the most compelling tales of civilian life reduced to a textmessage read aloud by several cast members? That cast is fine in a stolid, unemotional manner surely meant to reflect the demeanor of the veterans interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far weaker are the interviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to make banal questions seem interesting and then listen with a look of concern and empathy on your face,but whatever would have worked isn't accomplished by Katie Ochoa, who makes every question soundfalse and trite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Andrew Zimmerman rings equally false as an interviewer, though when he returns tothe stage as a soldier he delivers one of the show's lengthiest and most effective monologues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too often,the stories aren't allowed to unfold this way, which is why his tale is so engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better shaping of thematerial and a genuine focus on veterans as students might have made Civilian far more distinctive than it is. 2 BURN * 1/2 out of **** A new college student seduces a vulnerable professor of literary theory in this gay noir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or does he? Or is he? No one is quite what they seem in this melodrama by playwright Alex Defazio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul (Jody P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Person)is the professor who has just been dumped by his long-time lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manny (a comely Patrick Martin) isthe 19-year-old student who has the body of a 16-year-old and the mind of Anne Baxter in All About Eve.This kid is trouble and Paul knows it, even as he falls for the lad's naughty charms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manny is soonpeaking into the professor's laptop, having online sex with strangers, getting drunk on Paul's alcohol andbasically moving in, even as colleagues warn Paul about the danger he's in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

It's sincere but unaffecting,I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This can be done, as movies like Backbeat and The Hours and Times proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just not very easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Lennon with one of his biggest hits at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 12 Halle Berry's Flawless Bikini Bod Olsen Sister Flashes HerBra Scarlett's naked pics, TylerPerry is highest paid MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Entertainment News at THR.com More Celebrity News at People.comBecomes A TwitterTrending Topic Mark Ballas and PiaToscano Split READ MORE America's Got Talent Picksa Winner READ MORE Michaele Salahi Was NotKidnapped as Husband Claimed READ MORE Anna Faris On Her Boob Job &amp; Bulls*it Women Actress Friends Getting Back To Her Roots?
