( Conan Doyle for the Defense is in many ways a fond belated obituary for the long-overlooked OscarSlater, an immigrant everyman treated inexcusably by history.) Fox‚Äôs previous book, The Riddle of the Labyrinth, won the William Saroyan International Prize forWriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She lives in Manhattan with herhusband, the writer and critic George Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $27.00 (Hardcover) Published: June 26, 2018 Publisher: Random House Pages: 352 ISBN 10: 0399589457 ISBN 13: 9780399589454Personalize / Add More Choices What We Say This delightful work of popular history captures probably the last triumphant public act of Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doyle famously became involved in righting the wrongs of certain miscarriages of justice throughout hislife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The idea of the man who conceived of Holmes turning out to be a worthy detective in his own right is too delicious to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conan Doyle's most famous case involved a man of Indian descent who was railroaded by the courts; it was such a worthy act of redemption and the man so ideally noble and pure and the finale so perfect (the man attended the weddingof Conan Doyle to his new wife and Conan Doyle said he was prouder of this guest than anyone else in attendance) that thestory has been immortalized on film and in books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet there was one more case, one less well-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As New York Times senior writer Margalit Fox points out, the story of Oscar Slater -- an immigrant Jew living on the slightly disreputable fringes of society -- is far less black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conan Doyle disliked the man and kept him at arm's length and even pettily feudedwith Slater over some expenses when it was all over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes the story less suited to easy celebration, but a lot moreinteresting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox (the author of the acclaimed "The Riddle Of The Labyrinth") builds her case well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a deft, scene-settingintroduction, she tantalizes us with the facts of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An elderly wealthy widow is brutally murdered in her Glasgow home, a place so well-protected it qualifies as a locked-room puzzle worthy of Agatha Christie. (In a detail worthy of this knotty story, the widow was a nasty sort disliked by virtually everyone.) An investigation follows with over-looked clues andprejudiced assumptions fighting for our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox moves tantalizingly back and forth, offering up biographical sketchesof Conan Doyle, the real doctor that Sherlock Holmes was based upon, the alleged murderer Slater and even Glasgow itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And on justice rolls, with the police and the courts in cahoots to ignore unhelpful facts and punish Slater for the crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His imprisonment is a horror story in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credible allegations of poisoning of the prisoners to keep them docile and confusedis just one possible explanation for the soul-crushing despair and paranoia Slater exhibited at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conan Doyle focuses onthe case when it first caught the public's attention, does some work and then drifts away for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slater draws hisattention back to it with a desperate plea smuggled out of the prison via a note hidden in the hollowed-out dentures of a fellow prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all fascinating and delivered with wry intelligence and verve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real case Fox lays out is not about Slater: his innocence is so transparent, all we are left with is wondering exactly how Conan Doyle will succeed in freeinghim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, the real remarkable story is Conan Doyle himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One might expect a former spy to write some good spy thrillers;if they later indulged in some spying on the side, well, who would be surprised? But for a doctor to invent a detective and then prove superior himself to most detectives is rather amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conan Doyle did much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He pioneered the very idea of detective work, or at least popularized the idea of facts and evidence and building a case based on cluesrather than the usual method of the time: find a likely suspect and then make sure they pay, facts be damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConanDoyle inspired the police to collect reference works just like Holmes, to compile useful "databases" like what differenttobacco looks like when it is ash or the soils from different parts of their beat and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He may have made an honest fool of himself late in life with a persistent belief in fairies and the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Conan Doyle had as much of a positive impact on modern criminology as anyone in the actual business of police work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems elementary to us now, butConan Doyle was a trailblazer and he proved it in his fiction and even in real life, when a despised Jewish card sharpnamed Slater was rescued from the darkest hole in Scotland thanks to the persistence of a man that didn't even like him. -- Michael Giltz NOTE: I am casual friends with the husband of Margalit Fox and met her briefly once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can see her shine in the excellent documentary "Obit" and read rave reviews from Publishers Weekly and others for this new titleand her other books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Normally I avoid reviewing works by people I know, but when it's this fun who can resist? What Others Say ‚ÄúI cannot speak too highly of this remarkable book, which entirely captivated me with its rich attention to detail, its intelligence and elegant phrasing, and, most of all, its nail-biting excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I read it from dawn todusk, near-starving myself in the process, so eager was I to find out who did the murder, why the Glasgowpolice were such monsters, and why Sherlock Holmes‚Äôs creator was such a genius.‚Äù ‚ÄîSimon Winchester, author of The Perfectionists and The Professor and the Madman ‚ÄúNew York Times senior writer [Margalit] Fox brings to life a forgotten cause c√©l√®bre in this page-turning account of how mystery writer‚Äìturned‚Äìreal life sleuth Arthur Conan Doyle helped exonerate a man who was wrongfullyconvicted of murder. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The author‚Äôs exhaustive research and balanced analysis make this a definitive account,with pertinent repercussions for our times.‚Äù ‚ÄîPublishers Weekly (starred review) Praise for Margalit Fox‚Äôs book, The Riddle of the Labyrinth ‚ÄúEnthralling . . . [a] thoughtful, thrill-filled history . . . a tale of obsession and endurance and the high pricethat sometimes must be paid for forging into new territory . . . an exploration of the limits of the human mind.‚Äù ‚ÄîThe Plain Dealer ‚ÄúAn intricate and riveting story . . . a puzzle-solver‚Äôs delight and a detective story full of longing and frustration,discovery and maddening egotism.‚Äù ‚ÄîChicago Tribune ‚ÄúA gripping and tightly focused scholarly mystery . . . a testament to what the human brain, or at least the rarehuman brain, is capable of . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox is attentive to touching traces of idiosyncratic humanity [and] makes thecomplexities of linguistic scholarship accessible.‚Äù ‚ÄîMatti Friedman, The New York Times ‚ÄúIn Fox, the story has found a worthy Conan Doyle. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox successfully executes the balancing act oftranslating and distilling a specialized field of knowledge for a general audience without oversimplifying orsuccumbing to the didacticism of a textbook.‚Äù ‚ÄîDonovan Hohn, The New York Times Book Review What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
