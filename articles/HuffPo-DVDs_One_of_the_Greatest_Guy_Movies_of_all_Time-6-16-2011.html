(The term "bromance" could have been created todescribe the great chemistry they show here.) The tale is based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling andfeatures these two men wandering into an undiscovered kingdom via the Hindu Kush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to rifles(compared to the spears of the locals) and a mistaken belief that they are gods, the two soon have the runof the place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But love for the most beautiful woman in the land and the godly flaw of hubris ruins theirparadise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a corker, a real "guy" movie, and I'm always surprised when people don't know it as well as, say, The Magnificent Seven or The Great Escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't had a chance to sit down and truly enjoy it again yet, but a spot-check shows a fine transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRUE BLOOD THIRD SEASON ($59.99 regular or $79.99 BluRay; HBO) -- True Blood may be giving Glee a run for its money in the most Greenwich Village friendly show on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also passed Mad Men as the show with the most talked about plot twists and characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love it or hate it, you have to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still not my cup of tea -- I prefer the more humorous spin of the novels by Charlaine Harris -- but Ido feel I have to watch to stay current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HBO always provides nice packaging, but they also have thepriciest sets in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's good the suggested retail price has come down quite a bit from the heyday ofThe Sopranos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHO TOOK THE BOMP? LE TIGRE ON TOUR ($19.99; Oscilloscope) -- This road movie documentary captures Le Tigre on their world tour after signing to Universal for their first and onlymajor label album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a bit raw and for fans only, but captures the spirit of the band well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DVDfeatures solid extras, including a clutch of live performances not seen in the original 72 minute film,another concert from 2002, outtakes and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW US9 Signs Your Husband Is GAY, According To...PHOTOS: Kirstie Alley Makes Her Runway Debut Christina Ricci At Alexander Wang: Hit Or Miss?Keira Knightley: Sexually Dangerous Like 110K Like 76 Like 62K Like 2K Like 453 Like 2K Like 111 Like 3K Like 1KTHE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES ($34.99; Warner Bros.) -- This early directorial effort by Clint Eastwood gets a bit lost in the shuffle when assessing his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a western, it leans more towards his iconic spaghetti westerns, albeit more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a directorial effort, it doesn't feel like the fresh startthat Play Misty For Me and such later fare as Bird would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The post-Civil War saga is a complex affair but what sticks in the mind is the revenge Clint takes against the evil Union soldiers who slaughtered hisfamily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it doesn't quite glorify violence, but he sure looks cool taking them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would venturethat Clint went on to make Unforgiven to spell out clearly, once and for all the toll violence takes, even when you're in the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you saw only this and Dirty Harry, you might be right to think revenge is about the most badass game in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This BluRay edition looks smashing, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMERICAN: THE BILL HICKS STORY ($28.99 regular and $29.99 BluRay; BBC/2 Entertain) -- As Jesus said, no prophet is accepted in his hometown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stand-up legend Bill Hicks proved that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'san iconic figure to other comics little known to most Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hicks had to go overseas to find acertain fame for his groundbreaking work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why this film comes via the BBC label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as he wasbreaking through, Hicks discovered he had terminal cancer in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This inventive look at his careercombines interviews, performances, and animation, not to mention hours and hours of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Start withone of his classic routines and then come here to find out who the heck this guy is and why you haven'theard of him before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

APT PUPIL ($17.97; Image) -- A clutch of reissues worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've somehow been immune to the charms of American Graffiti , but I love the movie for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One, it made classic 50s rock and roll cool again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two it helped director George Lucas get the clout to make Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Stunt Man is a genuine cult movie in a world where "cult movie" is thrown around far too often and a sly spin on moviemaking beloved by people in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a great performance by Peter O'Toole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NightFlight is a little rickety but this is the very first time on DVD for this curio based on the novel Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupery (yes, the author of The Little Prince ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to read a great novel about aviation, get that book immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FInally, Apt Pupil is a very good adaptation of a Stephen King short story from Different Seasons, the peak of his short fiction career, thanks to tales that led to The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe someday someone will tackle "The Breathing Method," the fourth novella in this collection, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TALKING BASEBALL WITH ED RANDALL -- NEW YORK YANKEES/NEW YORKMETS/BOSTON RED SOX ($14.99 each; Talking Baseball) WHEN IT WAS A GAME; THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ($29.99 on BluRay; HBO) MLB BLOOPERS DOUBLEHEADER ($12.95; A&amp;E) PRIME 9 MLB HEROICS ($12.95; A&amp;E) 61* ($14.98 on BluRay; HBO -- Baseball-palooza!
