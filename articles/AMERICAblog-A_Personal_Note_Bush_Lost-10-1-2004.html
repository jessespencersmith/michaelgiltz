                <p>F R I D A Y , O C T O B E R 0 1 , 2 0 0 4A Personal Note: Bush Lost!!!by Michael in New York on 10/01/2004 02:21:00 PMMy father is slightly to the right of Pat Buchanan politically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He thinksSingapore is a good way to run a country -- let the little people voteon dog catcher but all the big decisions are made by a strong man inpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gets all his information from Fox News and right wing talkradio and the New York Times is filled with lies, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get thepicture -- if Fox News said 1 plus 1 is 3, then you're a dirty commiefor suggesting it might be 2, in my dad's view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have never heardhim say one negative thing about Bush.For kicks, I called him up and teasingly asked, "What did Fox Newstell you to think about the debate?" He paused and said, "I wasdisappointed." Huh? In the debate in general or Bush?"Bush just slouched too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kerry won the debate on looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hetold 21 lies [I let that slide] but Bush didn't...he was alright at first.But he kept attacking Kerry -- flip flop, flip flop -- and he didn't sayanything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just kept repeating the same things."And he kept stopping before time ran out! I couldn't believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Youcan rest your arm on the podium and look folksy at a rally, but this isa debate -- even though it's not a real debate -- and stand upstraight! Look presidential! He just didn't seem to have anything tosay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He should have said, here's the situation in Iraq and here's myplan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he just kept attacking Kerry and saying 'hard work' and'misleading.'"You could have knocked me over with a feather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did my father changehis mind? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will he still vote? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kerry just lita fire under his base and Bush deflated his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means fewer peoplerarin' to get to the polls and drag their friends with them.But don't forget your talking points: Bush is going to do a LOT betterat the next debate and learn from his awful performance here andKerry will be doing well to just hold his own against the Presidentbecause Bush has never lost a debate so he couldn't possibly lose twoin a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blah blah blah.Got any stories of far right family members and friends beingdisappointed and disillusioned? We'd love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser HuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...3 minutes agoFiredoglakeSave American Jobs: Close Your Chase Account -JP Morgan Chase refuses to do what it takes tosave 300,000 jobs and the healthcare of 700,000retirees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I decided today to no longer be a partof that....28 minutes agoDaily Kos"Difference isn't a threat" - Dave Neiwert, theblogosphere's leading expert on the eliminationistmovement, has a typically excellent post about theweekend's tragic shooting at Croo...35 minutes agoEschatonDeep Thought - Why is Chris Hayes always on myteevee?38 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...58 minutes agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V War Secrets - White HouseRead exclusive excerpts from BobWoodward's The War Within now!washingtonpost.comStimulus Plan PollShould GM Get More Fund? or U.S.CitizenGet Their own StimulusStimulusPlan.comInvestigate Bush &amp; CheneyJoin Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leahy's call for a truthcommission: Sign the petition now!ga3.org/campaign/btcpetition www.Newsmax.comAds by Goooooogle AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: A Pers...http://www.americablog.com/2004/10/personal-note-bush-lost.html 1 of 64/6/09 10:09 PM</p>
