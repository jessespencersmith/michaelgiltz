                <p>More Create Blog Sign In MONDAY, OCTOBER 08, 2018 THEATER: Bill Irwin Clowns (A Little), The Constitution Oppresses (A Lot) And "The WinningSide" Doesn't ON BECKETT *** out of **** WHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME ** out of **** THE WINNING SIDE * out of **** ON BECKETT *** out of **** IRISH REPERTORY THEATRE Let's make one thing clear: this is not a play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actor and clown Bill Irwin is giving a lecture, a talk or if it sounds less threatening a discussion of playwright Samuel Beckett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's true Irwin deliversexcerpts of pieces by Beckett and even clowns around a bit, but this isvery much not an evening of theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's subtitled "exploring the works of Samuel Beckett" and that's just about right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I emphasize this because I spent about half of this event recalibrating what I wasseeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure audiences who are wise enough to attend will enjoy ita whole lot more if they know precisely what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When did lectures go out of fashion? At the turn of the 20th century, going to a lecture or talk or public speech was quite the thing.Obviously radio and TV and even the wide availability of books madethat less necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes you can still go see lectures and talks butusually you'll be in a college setting or catch someone plugging a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Outside of David Sedaris tours, the idea of going to see a public figure weigh in on a topic has faded from view.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–º 2019 (7) â–¼ 2018 (34) â–º December (7)What a pity since hearing Bill Irwin share his thoughts on Beckett is fascinating and enlightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He charmingly introduces the event andperforms selections from eight different works, all the while sharinghis thoughts on Beckett's voice, the experience of acting in his plays (often, Irwin says, actors will finish a run and insist they were terrible and immediately wonder when they can do it again), the debate onhow to pronounce "Godot," the mind-twisting fact that this most Irishof writers wrote his work in French (!), the art of clowning, thepleasure of baggy pants, Beckett's early and powerful exposure to vaudeville and again and again the delightful puzzle of why and how this work speaks so forcefully to Irwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One answer he gives? No, hedoesn't love despair; he loves characters who face up to despair andsoldier on as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I thought I spotted the sly, savvy actor in Irwin, despite his charming, self-effacing aura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Young actor Finn O'Sullivan joins Irwinvery briefly when doing a scene from "Godot" that features amessenger boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After it ended, Irwin brought O'Sullivan back out for a quick bow and joshes with him before sending the lad on his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ahh, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smart! O'Sullivan rightly gets his moment in the spotlight,doesn't have to wait around for the final bow...and at the end of theshow Irwin will have the applause all to himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end ofthe evening O'Sullivan comes back out and they take their bows together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes Irwin's earlier gesture all the more generous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe that self-effacement wasn't an act after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irwin's performances are sharp and entertaining here, such as when he demonstrates various ways one can tackle a certain bit or admits trying to set Beckett's dialogue to some new internal rhythm like rap or a waltz. (It just doesn't work.) His insights are many and thesharing of an actor's process (or at least this particular actor's process)is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With just a spare stage, a few props and spot-on lighting(courtesy Michael Gottlieb), this master class in acting and Beckett is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the best lecture in town!

And so we get What The Constitution Means To Me, with Schreck in the heightened VFW hall of her dreams (the sets are by Rachel Hauck), delivering the debate speech she gave so many years ago butwith the interruptions and asides she couldn't say at the time, alongwith the hard-won wisdom and a more nuanced sense of historySchreck has gathered since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all very meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schreck is playing her younger self, though as she explains she won't be "playing" a 15 year old as such. (Though shedoes amusingly speed up her delivery as time runs out or feel sweetlyearnest at times, all of which reads "teen debater.") But then Schreckveers off and isn't delivering that long-ago speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's talking about her private life, the violence her mother witnessed as a child, the violence her grandmother endured, the abortion Schreck couldn'tbring herself to tell her mom about at the time, the statistics onviolence against women in this country and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimesshe's just a more informed debater; sometimes she's left the debate far behind and tears up at the memory of the degradation women in her family's history have faced or even how she had sex with a guy shereally didn't want to because -- as she jokes -- it seemed the politething to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she returns to that moment and clarifies that some inner voice told her not to die, to be scared for her life and do what she must to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all emotional and sincere and briefly harrowing and often funny.It's also completely artificial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I might blame Schreck's performance butI don't think there's anything particularly wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't buy it, but I didn't mind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the very structure and conceit of What The Constitution Means To Me that just doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We know Schreck is"recreating" a moment from her younger self's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when she "impulsively" changes tack and starts sharing info from her currentpoint of view, we know this is scripted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while it feels unfair of meto say this, even her emotional moments feel scripted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does she really wipe away tears thinking about her grandmother? Or is that simply a beat in the script? Frankly, I didn't even know if everything she saidabout her family was actually true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's what proves so frustrating about this work of theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't want to doubt or wonder the truth of any of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On one level, itshouldn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On another level, if it worked I wouldn't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But itdidn't work and I was annoyed that I found myself wondering precisely what was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of the evening, a young female debater comes on stage and they tackle an issue and an audiencemember chooses a winner...and even THAT felt scripted andunconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume every word of this confessional night isaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I certainly agree with the essential ideas she presented -- one of the most essential being that perhaps the Constitution was not created to slowly spread equal rights to all but simply to create afunctioning society in which only the men who created it would enjoythe most power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Schreck had just come out and said, "Here's the speech I would give today at the VFW" and told her story, it might have been less dramatic but it would have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What The Constitution Means To Me is heartfelt and sincere and I agreed with most everything it espouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as theater? I didn't believe it for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE WINNING SIDE * out of **** EPIC THEATRE ENSEMBLE AT THEATRE ROW The life of German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun is filled with moral complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He helped design the V-2 rockets that terrorizedLondon during WW II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then he also helped the US launch a rocketto the moon, inspiring not just Americans but truly the entire world.The bizarre reality of his journey is almost hard to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did he really go from a Nazi to a celebrated figure on Walt Disney's TV show in the 1950s, just one decade after the end of the war? A black satire, apenetrating drama -- the possibilities of how to tell his story areendless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Winning Side captures none of this in a flat, un-involving play that skims over the surface of von Braun's questionable life, saving any attempt to hold his feet to the fire for a confusing, haphazard final fewminutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, this play by James Wallert jumps back and forth in time in a confusing fashion, as if Wallert himself isn't sure where to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly it toggles back and forth from post-war America to Nazi-occupied Paris, where von Braun (Sullivan Jones) is wooing andperhaps falling in love with French actress Margot Moreau (played byMelissa Friedman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in the mix are Godfrey L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simmons Jr. as von Braun's military contact and Devin E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haqq as a about a dozen other characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any case, von Braun woos Moreau and she resists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, he's a Nazi! If anything, the play very modestly does a better job of showing her moral dilemma than his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even here it falls short since we areleft to imagine she might be asking von Braun pointed questions andpeeking into his briefcase for the Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems she wasn't, but the possibility is so strong they should have cleared up that potential path to redemption early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even worse, we never quite learn the fateof Moreau when just a little bit of stage business would have cleared itup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late in the play von Braun is in the US after being forced to leaveher behind. (Forced? One never knows with von Braun.) She sends a note pleading for help and he...carefully puts the letter away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does he do something later? Apparently not but having von Braun tear it upwould have made that point clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would have also painted him as avillain and the show doesn't want to point fingers too easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But are they worried we might not like him or that we might? Wernheris put through the wringer only at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's done so hurriedly I'mnot sure most theater-goers will follow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for some reason I wasalready aware that von Braun oversaw a factory in which thousands suffered as slave labor, many of them tortured or killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was probably impossible for von Braun to not be aware of these atrocities.Yet that barely comes across here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long ago I realized how wrong it is to judge actors trapped in a bad play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, the cast sport some outrageous accents, includingFrench and German and British.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end, I wasn't even sure abouttheir American voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sullivan Jones is certainly an appealingpresence but the material doesn't even begin to allow him a chance to present a complex character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most technical elements are ok though I did especially appreciate scenic designer Chika Shimizu's choice ofplacing a giant fan embedded in the top of the set so it could blow outair at the audience during key moments, like a rocket launch. (Itreminded me of a ride at Disney World, ironically enough.) A brief final stab at moral finger-wagging takes place -- but at the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't be so quick to judge von Braun, says the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insteadof listing the many positives that came out of the space program, forexample, it say, Hey, the pyramids were made with enforced labor and many people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one is calling for them to be torn down, are they? Well, no, but this is a rather weak tangent of an argument tomake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, act two opens with a short ditty by songwriter and satirist Tom Lehrer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It lasts maybe two minutes but in that brief time Lehrerdoes more to illuminate and skewer the pliable ethics of von Braunthan the rest of the play combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they were afraid the show might have us tut-tutting at von Braun, they needn't have worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Winning Side barely lays a glove on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Werner von Braun wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2018 Homelife/The Zoo Story (at Signature) *** out of **** Escape To Margaritaville ** Broadway By The Year: 1947 and 1966 *** Lobby Hero *** Frozen ** Rocktopia * Angels in America ** 1/2 Mean Girls ** 1/2 The Sting ** Mlima's Tale ** 1/2 Children Of A Lesser God ** 1/2 Sancho: An Act Of Remembrance ** 1/2 The Metromaniacs *** Summer: The Donna Summer Musical * The Seafarer ** Henry V (Public Mobile Unit w Zenzi Williams) * 1/2 Saint Joan ** Travesties *** 1/2 Summer and Smoke ** 1/2 My Fair Lady ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1956 and 1975 ** 1/2 Bernhard/Hamlet * 1/2 On Beckett *** What The Constitution Means To Me ** The Winning Side * Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the creator of BookFilter, a book loverâ€™s to BookFilter!
