                <p>DVDs: Not Crazy About Mad Men, The Very Cool Peter Gunn, Goofy Carol Burnett And More What's going on? Why have even more TV shows been pouring onto DVD and BluRay lately? And not just full season offerings but elaborate boxed sets of entire runs of shows?A couple things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DVD sales are slowing but the one area of strength is TV shows; peoplemay not bother to purchase every movie that comes out on DVD anymore, but they see alot of value in buying an entire season of a show they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if that's where the money is,that's where studios will focus their energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it's a lot easier to sell a digital downloadof a movie as opposed to 12 or 20 episodes of a show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So again, when it comes to TV,consumers like BluRay and DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, all the studios believe physical copies of moviesand TV shows are a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paramount even handed off a chunk of its valuablelibrary to Warner Bros. and said, we can't be bothered putting them out on DVD andBluRay. (They kept the digital rights.) In a few years, they imagine everyone will eitheraccess streaming video via Netflix, Hulu and the like or just buy a digital copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So for all these reasons it's a mad dash to cash in while the getting is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So fans of classic TV get to dig into lavish sets devoted to The Fugitive and The Carol Burnett Show and Poirot and Peter Gunn and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping studios and music unions (one of the big roadblocks keeping certain shows off of DVD because of high royalty demands)wise up and cut deals so we can finally see shows like The Wonder Years, I'll Fly Away,Hill Street Blues and (fill in the name of your favorite TV show missing on DVD) come out on disc while they still can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a rundown of some terrific sets that came out just inthe last two or three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's impossible to put them in order of preference: many ofthese are gems we've been waiting a long time for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE FUGITIVE: THE MOSTWANTED EDITION ($259.98 DVD; Paramount) -- Here's a classic example ofa TV show held off the market or released poorly in the past with substitute music cues. (That's why you don't see The Wonder Years or many variety shows on DVD much; the royalties for musicbecome insanely prohibitive even though the result is that the shows aren't seen foryears and no one makes any money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'mall for a fair price but for too long musicrights holders have been stubborn andshort-sighted.) The Fugitive is an anthology show disguised as a drama.Like Route 66, the vagabond Richard Kimble (David Janssen) would come into town, right a wrong or make friends and thenhead off into the night, with the determined Lt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gerard hot on his heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music of April 29, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 11/01/2012 12:00 amcomposer Dominic Frontiere was a key element in the show and it's almost all included here. (Apparently something is still missing -- maybe a song on a jukebox they couldn't clear? -- but most of the cues are original.) And they do right this time with a rare and welcome focus on Frontiere and his contributions to the show, down to a bonus CDsoundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The packaging is very attractive if you want to display it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better still, theslipcase contains all four seasons in standard sized cases that will fit neatly on your shelfif you want to file them alongside all your other shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a bit pricey (though it worksout to just $2 an episode, that's still a lot for such a vintage series), but the quality of thetransfer throughout is top-notch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is how it's done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAD MEN SEASON FIVE ($44.98 DVD; Lionsgate) -- Don Draper couldteach Richard Kimble a thing or twoabout going on the lam and crafting anew identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been waiting andwaiting for people to come to their sensesand realize the emperor has no clothes onthis show to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been deeplyunhappy with the creative direction of this show from season two on and now I just "hate watch" it to yell in frustration when they undermine good characterswith idiotic plot twists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Five wasthe worst by far and yet few others seem to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don is cursed with wives played by actresses who can't act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy (the heart of the show) is shunted off to the side even though every time she's given a scene the show is immediately far more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joan Harris has resisted using her sex appeal to advance her career throughout her life and proven herself invaluable to the firm thanks toher smarts and know-how...only to trade sex for advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really? After all these years? We pop into a minor character's travails over writing which haven't been referenced in years and are supposed to care? Really? And on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a very talented cast and the intelligence and craft is there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the scripts are dreadful and getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALL IN THE FAMILY COMPLETE SERIES ($199.99 DVD; Shout Factory) - - This show can still take your breathaway with its bluntness and truth-telling.I honestly don't know if it would be airedon network TV today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it pushed theenvelope but not in vulgarity andcrudeness as such, but in honesty abouthow people talked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's genius was not tomake Archie the butt of all jokes, anignorant fool constantly shown up by theliberal Meat Head Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He often wasthis, very often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Archie was a humanbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes he actually won anargument or more accurately left Michaelsputtering for a response even though Michael knew (and we knew) Archie was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure the show grew softer and Archiebecame more irascible and lovable than the sometimes ugly-minded bigot he began as.But that was seven or eight seasons in, or on the continuation of the show Archie Bunker'sPlace (which thank God is not included here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the complete nine seasons of the original series (surely three or four too many) and the first four or five are still potentstuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can see the show appreciating the impact it was having and starting to make"points" with its storylines, such as the attempted rape of Edith, all to the show's ultimatedetriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At its best, the main point of the series was to show a modern family dynamicin all its finger-pointing, name-calling, you drive me nuts but we're stuck with each otherreality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It put a face on ignorance and bigotry not merely to disarm it or mock it butsimply to see it for what it was; they didn't demonize Archie but they didn't downplay hisnastiness either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it was hilariously funny to boot, especially early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This nicely compact set has everything you'd want, including all 208 episodes solidly remastered, retrospectives, pilots for the direct spin-offs and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a landmark series in everyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PETER GUNN THE COMPLETE SERIES ($99.99 DVD; Timeless) -- Another ground-breaking series, this is one I've heard about more than I've seen.It's great to finally get a chance to dive in.The pilot -- written and directed by showcreator Blake Edwards -- has to be one ofthe all-time great pilots in TV history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ina tight, half hour, it sets up our coolprivate eye hero (Craig Stevens), the jazzclub where he hangs out, the girl singer(Lola Albright) he dates AND creates andsolves a mystery at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sintelligent, adult, sexy as all get out andnoir to the hilt; as good as many a solidnoir film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The picture and sound were solid in the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I dipped into episodes throughout the rest of the three seasons andthey're not all as pristine -- there's a notable background hiss on some -- but it's quitewatchable and this is the best we're going to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume the solving of crime in the blinkof an eye will get repetitive (and the girl apparently has a habit of always showing upduring a shoot out) but it's fun fare and far superior to most of its era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bonus ismainly a CD of that great score by Henry Mancini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CAROL BURNETT SHOWULTIMATE COLLECTION($199.95 DVD; Time Life) -- I recently reviewed a six DVD set of Carol's Favorites that came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you're really a fan of this variety show (which I grew up on Saturday nights), you're undoubtedly pleased that thosemusic rights issues which kept theshow truncated in syndication and off the market in proper form for so long have been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This mega-set contains 50 ofthe show's best episodes on 22 DVDs, along with commentary, reunion specials and thelike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not a fan of big bulky sets that can only sit on a coffee table or take up an entireshelf in your library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one is especially awkward with a thick carboard "curtain" youhave to yank up to reveal the DVDs inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, they're all in standard sized cases youcan line up on your shelf alongside other shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The remastered episodes look great andit's a blast to realize how embedded even the dance numbers are in my memory. (I mustadmit the song and dance numbers often came at the end of each episode and I drifted offto sleep sometimes when I knew no more skits were coming; hey, I was a kid.) It's a pitywonderful talent like Bernadette Peters and Sammy Davis Jr. often lip-synced toprerecorded tracks but that doesn't take away from the appeal of their vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And theheart of the show is the intro by Carol and the skits, all of which you know well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sstartling to see again how dark the "Family" skits became. (It was more Edward Albeethan Neil Simon by the end.) But skit after skit still appeals because they were such awarm ensemble and loved nothing more than to make each other laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I said it beforeand I'll say it again: it has the appeal of community theater where you watch old friendsperform in shows and have a rooting interest in how they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course here our "oldfriends" are talented TV stars we've never actually met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But did any other variety showever feel so approachable and down to earth despite the major talent on display? Carolchose the episodes to include herself and she's a crowd-pleaser so it's probable most of your favorites are here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know mine are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Available direct from Time Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POIROT: THE EARLY CASES COLLECTION ($249.99 BluRay; Acorn) -- We're approaching the grand finale ofPoirot , one of the most ambitious and successful TV mystery shows in history.Star David Suchet has made AgathaChristie's prickly Hercule Poirot entirelyhis own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a brief scare withcancellation, Suchet's desire to essentiallyfilm every single Poirot short story andnovel is coming to fruition with the 13thand final series that is filming right now,including Poirot's final case from thenovel Curtain .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the UK, series 1-12 have been sold as a boxed set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, since weknow a final series is coming, Acorn has opted for two complementary boxed sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here we have Series 1-6 with 45 mysteries in all, including hour long episodes and feature length adventures, all very smartly remastered and available in their original UK broadcast order and length. (Too often for AmericanTV, we see snipped episodes of Poirot and Foyle's War and the like with minutes trimmed off to fit the time slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not here.) The chance to see them all in order and watch Suchet sharpen and refine his performance is one I'm relishing, especially since for some bizarre reason I missed the train when this all began and only saw the show in bits and pieces here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'll surely rank with Jeremy Brett's Holmes as one of the great TVadaptations of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Find out how great starting here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FANTASY ISLAND COMPLETETHIRD SEASON ($39.97 DVD; Shout) - - Not every TV series from the past is agem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most aren't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But few are as puzzling today as a show like Fantasy Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why oh why did we watch this anthology series? It began as a lame-brained showvaguely set in reality: people paid for theprivilege of coming to Fantasy Island andgetting some wish fulfillment that couldbe arranged for a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But by the thirdseason the show -- always bad -- becameludicrous as hints of Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roarke's magicalpowers and godlike abilities becameincreasingly common and the fantasiesleft reality (I wanna be a cowboy!) to absurd heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An easy paycheck for faded stars, Fantasy Island did frequently have the benefit of guest stars better than the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More often, everyone deserved each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS SEASONTWO ($34.98 DVD; BBC) -- It would have been hard enough for this drama toget out from under the shadow of theclassic 1970s series it sprang from. (Thatshow is one of the all-time greats.) Butthis edition had the extra stumbling blockof Downton Abbey , a cheerful rip-off of the original Upstairs Downstairs that stole its thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They might have foundtheir own voice with season two butdisaster struck repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean Marsh(the star and co-creator of the original)was the key link to the past and she suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eileen Atkins (the otheroriginal creator) took a pass, unhappy with where the new team led by Heidi Thomas was taking her character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is atruncated season that was cancelled and so couldn't even muster a proper farewell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still,it's worth checking out the entire two seasons to see what might have been and imaginethe reception for it if those tarts at Downton Abbey hadn't thrown themselves at the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DUCHESS OF DUKE STREET($79.99 DVD; Acorn) -- The real spiritualheir to Upstairs Downstairs was this marvelous series by that show's mainstay producer John Hawkesworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He created this drama based on the true story of a scullery maid who became the mostfamed chef in London and proprietor of a classy hotel, Cockney accent and all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the role of a lifetime for Gemma Jones who made the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get all 31 episodes in this compact edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who is a fan of Upstairs or Downton should jump immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOUCH COMPLETE FIRST SEASON($49.98 DVD; Fox) -- If you're like me,you can be wary of committing to a newTV series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that's what held you back onTouch , the new drama from the creator of Heroes , you can rest easy that season two begins in January on FOX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KieferSutherland stars as the father of a littleboy who has mysterious powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Week toweek, Sutherland gets involved inmysteries that connect disparate people inunexpected and life-changing ways a laBabel and other movies with cross- current plots that tie together nicely bythe end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutherland is in fine form,tempering his Jack Bauer drive with moresensitivity and heart here.PSYCH SEASON SIX ($59.98 DVD; Universal) CASTLE SEASON FOUR ($45.99 DVD; Buena Vista) -- Sometimes I don'twant my TV to be ground-breaking andenvelope-pushing and filled with zombiesand elaborate backstories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes Ijust want to zone out with comfort food of the TV variety, a pleasing series withamiable characters that can gently entertain me for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter fun shows like Psych and Castle .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Psych is surely nearing the end of its run but the faux psychic Sean (James Roday) and hisfriend Gus (Dule Hill) remain goodcompany as they solve crimes in jokey,teasing fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Castle is in better shape since it's only on its fourth season andstar Nathan Fillion is as addictive ascatnip. (If Hollywood still made 'em likethey used to, he'd be a movie star.)
