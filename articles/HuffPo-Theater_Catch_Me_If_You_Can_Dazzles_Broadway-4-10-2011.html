But that already happened with actor Aaron Tveit's electrifying turn inthe Pulitzer Prize-winning show Next To Normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let's just say a star is confirmed with Tveit's winninglyconfident and charming performance as the young conartist Frank Abagnale Jr. in Catch Me If You Can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sings and dances and oozes sex appeal with ease; most ofall, Tveit simply belongs on stage under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like a pilot who strides onto a plane in uniform, Tveitinspires confidence in an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He comes out andstarts talking and you immediately relax: it's going to be a fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps when a star is surrounded by an excellent cast from top to bottom and a creative team that is perfectly in sync with the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Catch Me If You Can is a sheer delight from the poignant and brilliant book by Terrence McNally to the sexy but character-driven choreography by Jerry Mitchell tothe perfect sets by David Rockwell to the spot-on costumes by William Ivey Long to Kenneth Posner'smarvelous lighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all tied together by the superlative direction of Jack O'Brien which is seamless inweaving together drama, comedy, dance, acting, genuine scenes of pathos and casual banter with theaudience and orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the creative team in rehearsals: MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful InFOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Personal Finance | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: The Funniest People Not On TwitterMiranda Kerr &amp; Orlando Bloom Step Out To 'The The Funniest Someecards For Easter 2011Weekly Roundup of eBay Vintage Clothing Finds News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts Like 1 Posted: 04/10/11 10:02 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 2K Like 20K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCALThe lone exception to this litany of praise is the strong score by Marc Shaiman, which is not matched by the merely serviceable songs by Shaiman and co-lyricist Scott Wittman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a step down from their workon Hairspray .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The songs aren't bad and sometimes prove quite effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're the one element that keeps this from being an instant classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe you've seen the film by Steven Spielberg? It contains one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances as a kid, really, who starts writing bad checks and soon begins conning his way into a lifeof ease and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He fakes being an airline pilot, a doctor (!), a lawyer and soon has left a trail of cons amounting to almost $2 million that has FBI agent Carl Hanratty (the great Norbert Leo Butz) hot on his trail like a schlubby Inspector Javert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Frank falls in love with a girl (Kerry Butler), he's ready tosettle down and have a real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But is that even possible any more and would he know how? The smartest decision they made was to begin the show with Frank's arrest at a Miami airport, where he demands to make a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Hanratty responds that Frank isn't going to put on a show for God'ssake, of course that's exactly what he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a TV special in a way, which allows for all sorts of smarttouches and just the right sort of glitzy superficiality to let the story of his cons go down easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The orchestra is onstage on a riser, with stairways leading down, allowing for all sorts of razzle dazzle like you might have seen on The Andy Williams Show way back when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, Tveit is free to address the audience, introduce characters like his folks and his girl even when they're not going to appear in the realstory until much later and even get interrupted by Hanratty with some pestering questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This oneconceit -- Frank's story told as if it were a TV special -- works like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It informs everything thatcomes after it and makes this complex, time-shifting tale flow by effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the production numbers bring it home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I heard a sample of four songs sent to theater fans to encourage ticket sales, I was worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those same songs delivered with pizazz by a huge cast and with great choreography and sets deliver a genuine jolt of pleasure to the audience again and again. "Live InLiving Color" sets things off perfectly, right down to the chorus line high kicking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The female chorusgets to have more fun than the guys since they're constantly in sexy costumes and even get to solo duringnumbers with Tveit, whether it's as stewardesses in "Jet Set" or nurses in "Doctor's Orders." Time and again, the sets are just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A scene in the FBI offices contains just two subtly under-sized desks and some depressing office lighting stretching off into the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's it -- just a slantedimpression that the office goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why are the desks undersized? (You might not even notice it.)To emphasize their dull lives compared to Frank's? I don't know why, but it immediately delivers the information you need (where the scene is set) and the emotional state of the people in it with no muss or fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true of multiple bar scenes, Frank at home as a kid, the airport lounge and on and on --when a scene needs more, it gets more; when less is more, that's what they deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butz is the perfect partner for Tveit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gives gravity and weight to a character that might have just been a comic foil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to top Tveit but when Butz gets to knock it out of the park with "Don't Break The Striking Distance Of Obama Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
