Then he'd call up his brother md do the sme thing for mother fow hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just reallywanted that role " Affleck laughs when hearing Dmon's anecdote "When I like something, when I get excited creatively, it's hild to tum my brain off," he admits. "It doesn't happen that often " But he didn't feel my unease when working with his brother "I felt he was looking out for me and that was comforting," says Affleck, who flrst read the script for "Gone Baby Gone" when Ben brought it to him on the set of "Jesse James " "Ben was carefully watching lhe per- formance, so that memt I could tate risks and do whatever I wanted; that I could be 'bad,"' Affleck says "FeeLing like I could be bad is really liberating and helped me be better I wanted to make sure that I'm good in it because I know [as a director] he'1l go on to get better and better and do better and better movies I thinh he's found one of his true callings " c, , ,.,!!
