"The Resurrection of George FredericHandel": Handel falls into depression until a poet sends him an inspirational work. "The Genius of a Night": Captain Rouget writes La Marseillaise, the song which is to become the French national anthem."The Discovery of El Dorado": John Sutter founds New Helvetia in westernAmerica and attempts to keep it. "The First Word to Cross the Ocean":Cyrus W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Field resolves to lay the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say Between the two World Wars, Stefan Zweig was one of the most popular writers in the world -- admired in Austria-Hungary, Germany, the United States and pretty much everywhere outside of Great Britain, where the Viennese Zweig never caughttheir fancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He disappeared from view but his novellas, memoirs, short stories, novels and more have flourished in reprints lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Wes Anderson even celebrated Zweig via his cream puff of a movie "The Grand Budapest Hotel." Now here comes the reissue of a curious project: a collection of five brief essays on historic moments of inspiration and derring-do.Each essay is about 20-30 pages (maybe) and the entire slim volume flashes by in a white heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out now is aShare This Book About The Author Stefan Zweig Stefan Zweig was born in 1881 in Vienna, into a wealthy Austrian-Jewish family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He studied in Berlin and Vienna and was firstknown as a poet and translator, then as abiographer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between the wars, Zweig was aninternational bestseller with a string of hugely popular novellas including Letter from an Unknown Woman, Amok and Fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In1934, with the rise of Nazism, he leftAustria, and lived in London, Bath and NewYork--a period during which he produced his most celebrated works: his only novel, Beware of Pity, and his memoir, The Worldof Yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He eventually settled in Brazil,where in 1942 he and his wife were founddead in an apparent double suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of his work is available from Pushkin Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Translated by Anthea Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $16.95 () Published: November 14, 2017companion volume called "Triumph and Disaster." I imagined this was dredging the barrel a bit; they've run out of Zweig proper and are packaging together odds and ends? Far from it, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These works he dubbed Historical Miniatures ranked among Zweig's most successful, selling millions of copies in Germany alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can read popular historian Simon Winchester's blurb for this collection and no wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zweig combines Winchester's clear presentation of famed momentswith Zweig's breathlessly enthusiastic prose style, whipping up a frenzy of excitement over the moments he pins down soneatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Zweig describes Balboa's "discovery" of the Pacific in a caustic, mordant manner so amusing (Balboa was arogue, to say the least) that you even forgive him for writing that Balboa was the first human to glimpse the Atlantic and the Pacific. (Clearly a woke Zweig would have delighted in tweaking even this presumption with the fact that the locals had done so long before.) He also captures the frenzy of Handel as the man composed "Messiah," the quickly forgotten soldierwho dashed off the French anthem "Le Marseillaise" in a few hours, the bitter see-sawing fortunes of John Sutter inCalifornia and the laying of the trans-Atlantic telegraph cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If all history books were written with such elan, it would be the favorite subject of students everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zweig is funny, sharply observant of human nature, wise, perspicacious and even kindly in a god-like manner as he observes these events from an ironic but never dispassionate distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can gulpdown the book in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that would be like chugging a liqueur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I preferred to read one, take a break with someother reading and then tackle the next in a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are bonbons of history, amusing and yet not quite triflesbecause he packs so much insight into the heart of his stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A real treat. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Gems of literary perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I felt I had never read such lucid, liquid prose" Simon Winchester, Telegraph "The perfect stocking-filler for the Europhile in your life" Philosophy Football What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us Â©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
