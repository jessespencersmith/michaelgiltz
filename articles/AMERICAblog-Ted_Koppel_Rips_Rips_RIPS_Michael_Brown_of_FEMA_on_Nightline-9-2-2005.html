                <p>F R I D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 0 2 , 2 0 0 5Ted Koppel Rips, Rips RIPS Michael Brown ofFEMA on "Nightline"by Michael in New York on 9/02/2005 12:08:00 AMSome choice highlights.Koppel (on the number of people at the convention center --the mayor says 15,000 to 25,000 and FEMA said only 5000):One of you is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's either 5000 or 15,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you know?Brown of FEMA: Blah blah blah. 25,000....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We just learned ofthe convention center -- we being the federal government --today.Koppel: I've heard you say during the course of a number ofinterviews that you found out about the convention centertoday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't you guys watch television? Don't you guyslisten to the radio? Our reporters have been reporting on itfor more than just today.Brown of FEMA: We learned about (the convention center)FACTUALLY today that that's what existed.(Brown responds to another question by saying troops aregoing to be moving in soon.)Koppel: Here we are essentially FIVE DAYS after the storm hitand you're talking about what's going to happen in the nextcouple of days....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You didn't make preparations for what wasgoing to happen in the event that [a category four storm hit].Why didn't you?(Brown then complains that poor people who don't own carsand can't afford hotel rooms didn't jump into their SUVs andhead to the Hyatt in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He then sidesteps Koppel byimplying it was the city's fault for not having buses availablefor the very poor.)Koppel: I'm not asking you why the city didn't have busesavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm asking you why you didn't have National Guardswith trucks to get them out of there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why you didn't havepeople with flatbed trailers if that's what you needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why youdidn't simply get as many Greyhound buses from surroundingstates as you could lay your hands on to get those people outof there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why you haven't done it TO THIS DAY.Transcript and video coming soon.Thank God Koppel is there to ask the common sense questionswe've been talking about all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how soon before Browngets his Medal of Freedom?NOTE: One quote caught my ear but I didn't quite focus on it.I've played it again and Brown is laying the groundwork forputting the blame on LA's governor. (It must be a Fox Newstalking point; my dad made the same argument earlier.)Brown of FEMA: We work closely with the state government.The federal government didn not just come in here and tell thestate governor how or what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We came in here and said,'What do you want us to do? We will help you.'
