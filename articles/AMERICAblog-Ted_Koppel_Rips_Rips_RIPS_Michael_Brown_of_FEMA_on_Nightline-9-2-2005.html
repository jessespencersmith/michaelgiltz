Don't you guyslisten to the radio? Our reporters have been reporting on itfor more than just today.Brown of FEMA: We learned about (the convention center)FACTUALLY today that that's what existed.(Brown responds to another question by saying troops aregoing to be moving in soon.)Koppel: Here we are essentially FIVE DAYS after the storm hitand you're talking about what's going to happen in the nextcouple of days....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You didn't make preparations for what wasgoing to happen in the event that [a category four storm hit].Why didn't you?(Brown then complains that poor people who don't own carsand can't afford hotel rooms didn't jump into their SUVs andhead to the Hyatt in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He then sidesteps Koppel byimplying it was the city's fault for not having buses availablefor the very poor.)Koppel: I'm not asking you why the city didn't have busesavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm asking you why you didn't have National Guardswith trucks to get them out of there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why you didn't havepeople with flatbed trailers if that's what you needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why youdidn't simply get as many Greyhound buses from surroundingstates as you could lay your hands on to get those people outof there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why you haven't done it TO THIS DAY.Transcript and video coming soon.Thank God Koppel is there to ask the common sense questionswe've been talking about all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how soon before Browngets his Medal of Freedom?NOTE: One quote caught my ear but I didn't quite focus on it.I've played it again and Brown is laying the groundwork forputting the blame on LA's governor. (It must be a Fox Newstalking point; my dad made the same argument earlier.)Brown of FEMA: We work closely with the state government.The federal government didn not just come in here and tell thestate governor how or what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We came in here and said,'What do you want us to do? We will help you.'
