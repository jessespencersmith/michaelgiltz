(In contrast, his short stories areoften diamond-sharp and quite distinct from the sprawling, 19th century richness of his full-length works.) Unfortunately,Share This Book About The Author Mark Helprin Mark Helprin is the acclaimed, bestselling author of Winter‚Äôs Tale, In Sunlight and in Shadow, A Soldier of the Great War, Freddyand Fredericka, The Pacific, Ellis Island,Memoir from Antproof Case, and numerousother works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His novels are translated into more than twenty languages and read around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.95 (Hardcover) Published: October 03, 2017 Publisher: The Overlook Press Pages: 400 ISBN 10: 1468314769 ISBN 13: 9781468314762despite some flashbacks to WW II, this novel is set in contemporary France and ultimately devolves into an insurance scam, of all things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When tinged with fantasy and set in an alternate NYC, I can savor Helprin's grand passion, where every hero is brave and true and smart and stoic and pure of heart while the women they love are invariably angels that glow with purity and grace and joy and lightness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when you're stuck in the present and talking about a cellist and his late wife or one ofhis students -- the routine people of today -- it feels absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't help resisting, when one of the strengths of his writinghas been the pleasure of giving in to old-fashioned plotting and a high-blown style perfect for knights and days of yore.Here, I kept thinking of Ayn Rand or Nietzsche's superman, and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moment to moment, this story of a musician forced into desperate action when his grandchild is stricken with a dreadful disease has insight, humor and lovely passages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet instead of being elevated by the prose, ultimately the story is weighed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV philosophers, multi-nationalconglomerates, email -- it all feels far too pedestrian a setting for his concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I prefer Helprin in the past tense. --Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúA modern-day story of love, music, and death . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A masterpiece filled with compassion and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfect for the pure pleasure of reading.‚Äù - Kirkus, starred review ‚ÄúThe fluidity of Helprin‚Äôs prose . . . makes this novelof ideas so utterly captivating.‚Äù - Booklist, starred review What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
