                <p>T U E S D A Y , N O V E M B E R 0 2 , 2 0 0 4Ohio Bans HETEROSEXUAL Civil Unionsby Michael in New York on 11/02/2004 07:37:00 PMABC has just announced that in the grand tradition of Jim Crow laws,the state of Ohio has decided that some of its citizens -- namely gaysand lesbians -- don't deserve the same basic civil rights as otherpeople.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, they even refuse to recognize heterosexual civilunions.This is the first of what should be a long, painful night of anti-gaymeasures that will pass in most if not all of 11 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take somecomfort in this New Yorker article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margaret Talbot went to ananti-gay rally -- I'm sorry, pro-marriage rally -- where everyone feltobliged to bend over backwards and say they really didn't hate gaypeople and some of their best friends were gay people and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asthe article states, they may win the battle, but they're clearly losingthe war."It was hard to find anyone at the recent anti-gay-marriage rally inWashington, D.C., who had a bad word to say about gays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ChandraJudy, who had come to the “Mayday for Marriage” rally on the Mallwith her husband, Manford, and their ten-month-old baby, Eloise,“really wanted to say,” for instance, “that this was not aboutgay-bashing.” Chandra, who is slender and blond and wore jeans andshiny pale-pink lipstick, said she was a professional dancer inWashington, and knew a lot of gay people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had no objection tocivil unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What she and her husband were worried about was theinstitution of marriage. “If the sanctity of one man and one woman isnot protected, if we keep expanding the definition, then where’s itgoing to lead?” Manford wondered. “One man and ten women? A manand a child?” He did not add, as some people attending the rally did,“A man and a dog?” He wore a grave expression and appeared toweigh his words carefully...."All this careful sympathy for the sinner raised the question of howmuch appetite Americans—even Americans who oppose same-sexmarriage—really have for a long fight against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to MichaelCromartie, who directs the Evangelicals in Civic Life project at theEthics and Public Policy Center, in Washington, there is “a kind ofambivalence just beneath the surface of opposition to same-sexmarriage, even among people of strong religious convictions,” anambivalence that may mean it will not become the long-lasting socialcrusade that the anti-abortion issue is...."Chandra Judy was certainly stressing the positives, as well as shecould under the circumstances. “I do believe it’s a choice,” she said,clapping warmly for Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dobson as he strode to the stage. “But ifpeople choose to be homosexual that’s their right, and they shouldget legal benefits and all those things.”"Cold comfort tonight, but a warming thought for the future.UPDATE: Add Georgia and Kentucky and Oklahoma to the list ofstates attacking the basic civil rights of their gay citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotta lovethe red states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost PoliticsJeffrey Smith: Governor Sebelius Must Veto KansasBill That Endangers Milk Safety - Governor Sebeliuswants to be our new Secretary of Health andHuman Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But before she is sworn in, shehas an important job to...2 minutes agoEschatonOvernight - Rock on.56 minutes agoDaily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's RescueRangers are Louisiana 1976, jlms qkw, shayera,dopper0189, ybruti, and srkp23 with vcmvo2editing.* ~ World order will be secured only ...1 hour agoCrooks and LiarsC&amp;L's Late Night Music Club: The 50 State Strategywith The Pine Box Boys (CA) - Title: Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SkeletonArtist: The Pine Box Boys San Francisco isn'tknown for Bluegrass, but maybe if there weremore bands like The Pine Box Boys, it would ...1 hour agoFiredoglakeLate Nite: Michele Bachmann Stars in “Birth of anAberration” - Minnesota's wackiest export treadsthe boards of the Wingnut dinner theater.2 hours agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Next 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Ohio ...http://www.americablog.com/2004/11/ohio-bans-heterosexual-ci... 1 of 64/7/09 1:52 AM</p>
