                <p>F R I D A Y , O C T O B E R 2 9 , 2 0 0 4The Chickens Are Coming Home To Roostby Michael in New York on 10/29/2004 02:00:00 PMThank God in America you can only get away with indecency andbreaking the law for so long before justice begins to prevail again.First, former British detainees held in Guantanamo Bay are suingDonald Rumsfeld, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and nine othermilitary officials because they say they were tortured in violation ofUS and international law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to see Rummy take the stand andexplain himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The men involved say they were initially held incustody by the Taliban on suspicion of being British spies and thensold by an Afghan warlord to US soldiers for $35,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What anightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's what happens when you think you're above thelaw and can throw people into a hole for years on end and never haveto justify to anyone who you're imprisoning and why.Then, USA Today also reports two Navy SEALS are facing courtmartials for allegedly assaulting a detainee at Abu Ghraib who died incustody.And finally the UN condemns the use of torture in a pointed rebuke ofthe US, pointing out the obvious -- that you can't claim the moralhigh ground and then break all bonds of decency by using themethods of the enemy."The absolute nature of the prohibition of torture and other forms ofill treatment means that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever,whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instabilityor any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification fortorture," the report said."No executive, legislative, administrative or judicial measureauthorizing recourse to torture and cruel, inhuman or degradingtreatment or punishment can be considered as lawful underinternational law."Isn't it shocking that this is directed at the US instead of SaddamHussein, North Korea, Saudi Arabia or some other nightmarishcountry?
