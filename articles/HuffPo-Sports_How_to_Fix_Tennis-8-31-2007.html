(I'd also toss in a tournamentwith wooden rackets, but that should be an exhibition match, I suppose.) 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get those cameras on every line at every major as soon as possible - The player challenges to calls have proven a huge plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only does it reduce terrible errors (which are inevitable with humans in charge), but it's also reduced complaining and whining from the players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't moan about certain calls, they just challenge them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's reduced arguing and increased respect all around. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revisit medical time-outs - As proven in the epic James Blake-Fabrice Santoro five-setter Thursday night, the medical time-out is being wildly abused and has turned into a de facto time- out, something tennis doesn't need since players get to rest every other game. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Treat the Davis Cup like the All-Star break - turn this tournament between the top players of each country into a real event that takes place every two years (or three years or four years) andplop it into the middle of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's tremendously valuable for the worldwide growth of thegame and U.S. fans will support a little jingoism if given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now, 99 percent of theU.S. fans haven't a clue when Davis Cup is played. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tear down Arthur Ashe Stadium - It's not just the worst tennis stadium, it may well be the worst sports stadium built in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the seats are in the upper section and they're so high up it's literally impossible to follow a match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why the fans are so noisy at the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open-- they're bored out of their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's so cavernous that it's literally a joke -- people sitting therewonder if clouds will obscure their view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the lower levels for the fat cats are poorly designed,with concrete expanses so wide that the seats look half empty even when people are in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theydidn't even bother to think about a retractable roof and design Arthur Ashe so one could be addedlater -- if they chose -- for a reasonable amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tear it down and start again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's aninsult to the great player that the stadium was named after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Living...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

Please, everybody, stop repeatingthat old saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have you watched a classic match recently? BORING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like watching basketball from the50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limiting string tension? Why? That's limiting how hard someone can hit the ball, like limiting howfast someone can run the bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only is it not necessary (Roddick has a150-mph serve and all the top players have found an answer for it, otherwise he would win all thetime), it actually requires more skill to control a ball hit that hard and more skill to return it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tennis is at azenith in terms of the skill required to compete at the top level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hingis, a great champion of the late 90s,can't seriously be considered a threat anymore -- that's how much the game has advanced in just a fewyears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching Federer play Nadal is better than anything in the history of the sport, Mac/Connors orEvert/Navratilova be damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I think some of those classic matches are still fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you're absolutely right thatthe level of play and varied styles out there today is terrific and a lot of fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyonce in a while you'll get some extremely tall guy like Isner and the match wil be a little odd(though it was fun to watch Federer bream him down) or someone with a massive serve andno game will get through a few rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that sort of thing happens in any sport.Eventually, everyone figures out the new pitcher or the new batter and things settle back tonormal where a well-rounded game is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federer versus Nadal is indeed a rivalry forthe ages and the idea that it's no fun because Federer isn't wacky off court or viewers in the US don't care because they're not American is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great for the sport. provgrays See Profile I'm a Fan of provgrays permalink Equipment can adversely effect and dramatically change a professional sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Golfers are better than they have ever been, but advances in equipment in that sport have renderedformerly challenging courses too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why do you think baseball still uses wooden bats?

There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I think tennis becoming a world-wide sport is a plus, not a negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The US -- like every othercountry -- will have moments when their stars shine and moments when they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butpeople don't care whether their soccer stars are Beckham or Ronaldo, whether their baseballstars are Hideki Matsui or some new kid from Cuba -- great talent is fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I think it's more widespread than wecurrently know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the original post:Kudos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't say I disagree with any of the changes you suggest.I do think there should be more play on grass and indoor carpet because those surfaces are more forgiving on the body than both hardcourts (too hard on the joints) and clay (too grueling, the points justgo on far too long).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grass has become slow enough that baseliners without huge serves can still produce results and indoor carpet is well... carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for the provocative discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink With just two people playing, I suppose you're right about fixing being easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is really going to be depressing if it's widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm a huge baseball fan and steroids drive mebonkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do believe it will be limited to mid-level players who needed the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I doubt themajor stars were approached or agreed, so it will be the difference between #37 losing to#110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Lots of people have brought up the idea that tennis is boring now because of the racquets and stringsand power games with massive serves and no rallies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I've said already, Federer is changing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ithink a whole generation will grow up developing rounded games that use finesse and style and thewhole court just like he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the biggest blind spot in this argument is the women's game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I canremember the days when Tracey Austin and Andrea Jaegar would hit moonballs for hours at a time,driving fans to boo in boredom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Evert was a unique, exciting talent but her game inspiredimitators who couldn't bring anywhere near the excitment she did to a baseline game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took MartinaNavratilova, Chrissie re-inventing herself to face that challenge and the host of innovators who followedto reinvent women's tennis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The women's side is FAR more exciting than it has ever been, with a lotmore athleticism and excitment and full court play but without losing the strategy and style that can make the sport so exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the men's side is recovering from the massive serve/no rally era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to see a tournament played with wooden racquets, but overall (especially when you take into account the women's side) I think tennis is as fun as ever to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And to be realistic, there is no way the players or the sponsors (ie tennis racquet manufacturers) will let composite racquets be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sa non-starter. provgrays See Profile I'm a Fan of provgrays permalink You raise solid points and I love the wooden racket idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
