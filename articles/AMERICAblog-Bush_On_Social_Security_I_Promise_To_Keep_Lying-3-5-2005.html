                <p>S A T U R D A Y , M A R C H 0 5 , 2 0 0 5Bush On Social Security: I Promise To KeepLyingby Michael in New York on 3/05/2005 12:33:00 PMBush is barnstorming the country to try and raise a littlesupport for his plan about rescuing Social Security -- eventhough Social Security doesn't need "rescuing" according to hisown government and Bush refuses to endorse any particularplan.Bush was "challenging skeptics to put their own ideas forward,"according to the New York Times, which takes a lot of chuztpahwhen you haven't put your OWN idea forward yet. (Mainlybecause your own idea begins with creating trillions in debt andcutting benefits by 40%.)Then, in classic Orwellian style, Bush just started lying andrenamed one facet of his proposal, giving it the same name asa DIFFERENT proposal made by some Dems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, he didn'tchange anything about his murky plan -- except the name."See, personal accounts is an add-on to that which thegovernment is going to pay you," Bush said, according to theNYT. "It doesn't replace the Social Security system."That's a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An add-on is what some Dems have stupidlysuggested, that private accounts be created as an optionalongside the current Social Security system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People should beencouraged to save for their retirement and make investments-- we don't need a massive new federal government programto accomplish that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, most Dems think if you being privateaccounts alongside SS, that soon enough the Republicanswould be chipping away at SS, snipping and snipping at it onthe edges until they'd accomplished the same thing they wanttoday: to dismantle SS and leave elderly Americans without asafety net.But Bush's proposal is NOT an "add-on." Benefits are cut by40% in the most "popular" Republican plans (popular on WallStreet and with those who think the elderly have it too cushy --not popular with the vast majority of Americans).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And theprivate accounts are part of your basic benefits package, theyare not in addition to your benefits, they ARE your benefits.And if your investments go sour, you're out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hisspokesperson explained that Bush hadn't embraced the idea of"add-ons" as everyone else understood the term -- he'd justdecided to call what he was doing by a different name.So Bush just lies and calls apples oranges and up down andstupid smart.The Dems continue to show a lot of discipline, with their ownbarnstorming getting a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really liked SenatorRichard Durbin's description of Bush's "ownership society" --"We're all in this alone."Bush says: "Well, I'm going to keep telling people we've got aproblem until it sinks in, because we've got one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can'tdodge whether we have a problem or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because, see, thenext follow-on question to that is, if you've got a problem,what do you Republicans and Democrats and a few Paul KrugmanProfessor in chief - I found Obama's health carepresentation so impressive - so much command ofthe issues - that it had me worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I really like apoliticians' speech, is...9 minutes ago EschatonObama Speaks - In Case You Missed It18 minutes ago Daily KosWaterloo, But for Who?
