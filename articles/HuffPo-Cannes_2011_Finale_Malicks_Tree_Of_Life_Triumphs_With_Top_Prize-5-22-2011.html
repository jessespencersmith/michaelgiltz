"What a week it's been," Dunst reportedly said on accepting the prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other top winners included the Dardenne brothers whose marvelous movie The Kid With A Bike tied for runner-up with Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Once Upon A Time In Anatolia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Anthony Weiner Admits Sending Racy Pictures, Refuses To Resign New Photos Emerge In Anthony Weiner Twitter Scandal FOLLOW US PHOTOS: Who Won Big At This Year's 'Fashion Oscars'?Michelle Obama Wears Naeem Khan To State Dinner Nancy Pelosi Wears Vintage Thierry Mugler To 7 Sites You Should Be Wasting Time On Right NowBIG NEWS: Movies Celebrity Body The Kardashians Katy Perry Microsoft More Log in | Sign Up News Web Bad Guy?

Ultimately, I judge a festival not by the amount of work I was able to snag or the fun I had, but simply by the number of good movies I saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost every year, someone says "This is the worst Cannes ever." Butinvariably, I end up with two or three films that will make it on my best of the year list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's prettygreat, if you can catch two movies that will rank among your favorites in just a 12 day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thisyear at Cannes I saw four films I rated 3 1/2 stars or 4 stars and all will likely be in my Top Movies OfThe Year list come January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in another six movies I gave 3 stars to and I must say this is a stellar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw 40 movies and one out of every four was good or great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who can ask for anything more? Those top four movies? The Tree Of Life, The Footnote, The Artist and The Kid With A Bike .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find links to all my coverage below along with a complete list of the movies I saw and links to thosereviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COVERAGE OF CANNES CANNES 2011 DAY ONE: WOODY LOVES "PARIS;" "SLEEPING BEAUTY" GETS DARK CANNES 2011 DAY TWO: ANGRY KIDS, DYING KIDS AND KIDS IN DANGERCANNES 2011 DAY THREE: A POPE, A PIANIST, A PHILOLOGIST AND MORECANNES 2011 DAY FOUR: GIRLS WITH BABIES, BOYS WITH BIKES AND OUTLAWS WITH CHI CANNES 2011 DAY FIVE: CAN CANNES HANDLE A TRULY FUN FILM?
