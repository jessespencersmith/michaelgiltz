                <p>'The Sound of Music' is 40 years old, yet star Julie Andrews says her prim image refuses to die By MICHAEL GILTZ JULIE Andrews is professionally polite and chipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if she hadn't starred in 1965's "The Sound, of Music" and 1964's "Mary Poppins" -two of the most ---~~- delightful and whole­ some musicals of all time -it's easy to believe she'd still be seen as proper and very well behaved. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you're hoping Oscar-winner Andrews will dish dirt on her co-stars, you hope in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our image of the 70-year-old Andrews is these roles, even though she's worked consistently ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent hits include "Shrek 2" and the upcoming "Shrek 3" (she voices a queen), "The Princess Diaries" fJ1ms (ditto), the TV movies based on the "Eloise" books, and her own line of best-selling children's books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp keep demanding her attention. "Poppins" has just been turned into a critically acclaimed stage musical in London, which will likely hit New York in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And "The Sound of Music" is out on DVD Nov. 15 in a new deluxe set (Fox; $26.98) bursting with commentaries, new documen­ taries and, of course, Andrews. "The Sound of Music" was an overwhelming hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Were you bored by the goody-goody image. ? It ain't true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I knew at the time how lucky I was to get the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the press made a lot about my squeaky-clean image and my wanting to tweak it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it bothered the press more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So 1981's ''S.O.8.'' (your husband Blake Edwards' scabrous valentine to Hollywood in which you bared your breasts) wasn't meant to shock us ? Blake wrote "S.O.B.," and he knows me very well It was a fimny idea There's nothing wrong with tweaking your image every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's nothing I get uptight about, I assure you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suppose it's only fair people tease you for that wholesome image since you mocked "1be Sound of Musie in one of your concerts with carol Bur­ nett before you'd even been cast in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The footage we see on the DVD extras of you perf0rm­ ing "From Switzerland: The Plat Family" is funny. [Laughs] I had no idea I'd be playing the role at that point and was a bit nervous about it when they started to consider me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carol and I are talking about doing a ret­ rospective on those concerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sort of a best-of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One other big myth surrounding "The Sound of Music" is that you and Christopher Plummer despised each other during the filming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's very frank in the new documentary on the DVD, admit­ ting he thought at the time the movie was beneath him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also says he behaved snobbishly and rather poorly on the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So isn't it true? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were friends even before we went on the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd-been friends from the Broadway stage, but it certainly cemented the friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've worked together since, and we send each other notes and go to see each other's shows, and it's a very lovely friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You were confused by the lyrics to "I Have C0nfi­ dence." Your decision to play it as babbling non­ sense -Maria will say anything to convince her­ self she's not scared -comes across perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lyrics were complicated, and I wasn't quite sure what they meant. "Strength lies in nights of peaceful sillmber?" I had a real, "Hmro, what am I supposed to be doing" moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It actually helped the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many fans of the movie know the field in that opening shot where you sing the title song isn't reaDy that accessible on foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tourists who go there have to take a troIley-car ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I had no idea that the helicopters used to capture those sweeping first images came so close that you were getting battered to the ground again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was fimny and ironic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You see this love­ ly shot on mm, but I'm getting pummeled.</p>
