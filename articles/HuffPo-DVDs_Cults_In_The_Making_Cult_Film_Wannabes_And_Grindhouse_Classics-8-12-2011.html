THE FOX AND THE HOUND I AND II ($39.99 BluRay combo or $29.99 DVD; Disney) MARS NEEDS MOMS ($39.99 BluRay combo or $29.99 DVD; Disney) -- How times change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back in 1981, The Fox and the Hound was a fascinating movie from the moribund Disney animation department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was gentle and quiet, not based on any well-known property or bursting with action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just a simple tale,beautifully told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't classic Disney, but it showed there was life in the old fella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was reassuringsince it had been 14 years since the great score for The Jungle Book , 20 years since the smash hit One Hundred and One Dalmatians and a quarter of a century since their last undisputed classic The Lady and the Tramp. (Nope, I don't consider Sleeping Beauty a classic but even that was 22 years in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fox and the Hound gave you hope, with The Great Mouse Detective (an even better movie) just five years away and then the dramatic debut of The Little Mermaid in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here it is in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney needed reviving again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pixar is a wonder for the ages (and deep in Disney's debt creatively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Disneyitself had floundered badly in animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It came roaring back with Tangled , their best film since Tarzan more than a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hoping to build on that success was Mars Needs Moms, another unconventional film that didn't seem to follow a formula, this one created by Robert Zemeckis, who hasgrown passionate about animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, it was almost toxic, with audiences staying away with thatinstinctive sense for a movie that just doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, they were right but hopefully Disney can buildon Tangled instead of gettin sidetracked by MNM .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scarlett's naked pics, Tyler Perry is highest paid MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity Music Film Buy a link here Sponsored Links Hyatt Summerfield SuitesÂ® All Suites Hotel with a Full Kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Breakfast &amp; Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book Now Hyatt.com/SummerfieldSuites College - 100% Online Be more employable!

(Really, couldn'tthey include the Braves radio call as well? Isn't that just salt in the wound?) It's manna from heaven forbaseball fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now bring on the Miracle Mets! JUMPING THE BROOM ($35.99 Bluray and $30.99 DVD; TriStar/Sony) SOUL SURFER ($38.99 BluRay combo or $30.99 DVD; Sony) -- Tyler Perry isn't the only game in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Producer T.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jakes (who also has a small role) brings in the quiet moral grounding of this comedyabout a self-made millionaire from Brooklyn marrying a Martha's Vineyard rich girl and the culture clashof their two families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angela Bassett is no pushover, but I think Loretta Devine as the groom's mothercan take her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strong cast with Paula Patton and Laz Alonso up front make this go down easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aneven stronger message about the power of faith is present in Soul Surfer, a family friendly movie about the surfer who had her arm bitten off by a shark but found the strength to get back in the water and startcompeting right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid are the supportive parents and Carrie Underwoodcertainly has a better vehicle here in a supporting role than Kelly Clarkson ever selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLASH ($19.97; Vivendi) -- Just as Ong-Bak showed Thailand cinema was ready for primetime, the Vietnamese box office smash Clash shows Vietnam has the ability to match Hollywood in stunts andaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tale of a mother whose daughter is kidnapped and must therefore track down an all-important harddrive is too silly for words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's just an excuse for some inventive stunts and the hard-boiled antics of the mysterious but ferocious Johnny Tri Nguyen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Puts Nam on the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZEN: VENDETTA/CABAL/RATKING ($39.98 BluRay or $34.98 DVD; BBC/2Entertain) -- I haven't caught up with this new mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But friends who gobble up those shows on PBS and the like saythis adaptation of the best-selling novels about Italian detective Aurelio Zen are top-notch and a great fitfor actor Rufus Sewell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They know what they're talking about so I'm looking forward to watching thesethree tv movie-length episodes.Paul Rudd In Playboy: Self- Loathing, Nudity And...

SEASON 1 ($29.93; Shout) -- I always bemoan the repackaging of kid's TV, with studios teasing out a season of episodes over three or four discs released in waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It means tons of cost and bulky packaging and bad karma all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the way to present a TV series: the entire season in one set, with four discs nicely packaged by Shout and at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a bonus, the show is good enough to deserve some extras like audio commentaries, but let's not get greedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looks very good, by the way and that's what matters most -- the shows themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does notguarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover eachweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Buy a link here Sponsored Links Hyatt Summerfield SuitesÂ® All Suites Hotel with a Full Kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Breakfast &amp; Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book Now Hyatt.com/SummerfieldSuites College - 100% Online Be more employable!
