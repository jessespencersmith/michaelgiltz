                <p>S A T U R D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 1 7 , 2 0 0 5With Bush In Charge, We Won't LearnANYTHING From Katrinaby Michael in New York on 9/17/2005 11:00:00 PMNo wonder Bush and the Republicans oppose a bipartisan,independent commission -- it's a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have topay lip-service and testify and then read the damn report (thatthing is long; it's like a book or something!) and then hope noone notices that they ignore most of the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sowhy not just kill the thing before it starts?The members of the 9-11 commission all spoke out tocondemn the response to Hurricane Katrina and point out theobvious: that most of their common sense, reasonable,why-the-hell-haven't-we-done-this-before suggestions havebeen completely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd think this was prettynoteworthy given the utter incompetence of Bush and hiscronies after having four years and billions of dollars to preparefor a threat that was widely predicted and trackable days inadvance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So where did the NYT run the comments of the 9-11commission? On page A-23 in a tiny little box.9-11 figure Thomas Kean was on ABC highlighting just onerecommendation that was ignored that could have made a bigdifference: devoting "spectrum" on the airwaves to firstresponders so they could communicate with each other. (On9-11, the firefighters couldn't speak to the cops who couldn'tspeak to the people in helicopters or the EMTs, etc.) You'd thinkthis would be done ASAP -- who the heck would object -- butright now Congress is looking at getting it done by 2009.Brilliant.Any reason why we shouldn't kick out every bum who refusesto enact these proposals and -- after a later tragedy -- refusesto even study what went wrong?
