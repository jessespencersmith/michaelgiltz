($16.99; Paramount) -- Wildly popular fixture on Jack's Big Music Show, Laurie Berkner pulls together some (but by no means all) of her videos found there and elsewhere on Nick Jr and Noggin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get 16 songs, intro'd by Moose and Zee with encouragement to get up and dance along, as well as four more music videos. "Rocketship Run," "VictorVito," the hard to argue with "I'm Me and You're You" are some of the cuts included, all of which arecatchy and clever enough to keep parents engaged as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'M GONNA EXPLODE ($24.98; IFC) -- This "Mexican New Wave" drama follows two misfit teens who pretend to run away from home but really camp out on the roof of the boy's residence while his corrupt politician father and her easily distraught mother seek them out all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer- director Gerardo Naranjo has a pretty good eye and a certain talent for stringing out an entire film fromthis very modest premise, which barely develops more than I've described here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boy is sexily confused about his life of privilege and the girl is blunt and no-nonsense but we don't know much more about them at the end than we did at the beginning and they certainly don't seem like star-crossed loversa la Romeo &amp; Juliet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late in the film, when they crash a birthday party and the boy is a boorish drunk, wereally start to question liking him at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he is just a spoiled kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the movie lurches into unearned melodrama that's utterly out of step with the previous 95 minutes and they lost me for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Naranjo will develop more, but this is a part-boring, part-pretentious Godardian riff.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST MY FAVORITE SPY ($24.95; Olive Films/Paramount) -- Olive Films is an imprint that's been diving into the Paramount vaults and rescuing the movies that the studio hasn't released for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After months of releases, it's safe to say that Olive is a dependable label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their movies have noextras to speak of usually (something I personally don't care about, frankly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the important point isthat they take good care to present a decent print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish the price point were lower but they're probably doing what they can to eke out a profit on movies that are curiosities even to most film buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if the movie interests you, rest assured the quality should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Bob Hope vehicle will hopefully proveone of their best sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's Hope in fine form as a cowardly comic dragooned into the spy business and(growllllllll) happily paired off with Hedy Lamarr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all handled ably by Norman Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McLeod and ranks as one of Hope's solo best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out is the Danny Kaye vehicle Knock On Wood , a so-so movie star biopic Harlow , late period Bette Davis in Where Love Has Gone and Kirk Douglas slumming it in the gloriously tacky Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV ROUNDUP TV sets come out in such a deluge, it's hard to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a rundown of the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petty Blue ($19.99; Paramount/CMT) -- This won't interest non-fans, but for people who love NASCAR and know the Petty family legacy, this Kevin Costner-narrated documentary is a fine look at the men who literally made NASCAR from its earliest beginnings to itsheyday with Richard Petty and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries Set Two ($49.99; Acorn) -- I do enjoy Lord Peter Wimsey (the books are splendid) and Ian Carmichael is good in these three mysteries, all of which are four-parters of 50 minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since we had this series in a complete (ifbulky and expensive) boxed set, it seems a step back to release them again in multi-set offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who wanted to rent or buy Set One will surely want Set Two and vice versa so why bother doing them alone? CSI Tenth Season ($79.99; Paramount) -- Marg Helgenberger becomes the de facto head of the team even as Laurence Fishburne settles more into his role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get the usual season- long arc of a serial killer, crossover episodes with the other CSI 's (included in the extras) and the high-tech wizardry that has about as much to do with most police work as Formula 500 racing does to your regular commute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legend Of The Seeker 2nd Season ($45.99; ABC Studios) -- As so often happens, this show - - based on the much darker Sword Of Truth novels by Terry Goodkind -- started to find its way in season two just as the plug was pulled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little more action, a little more freedom tohew closer to the books (rather than create standalone episodes) and a realization that this was NOT Hercules or Xena all helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not great but fantasy pickings are slim on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Magic &amp; Bird: A Courtship Of Rivals ($19.98; HBO) -- Earvin Johnson and Larry Bird comprised one of the great rivalries in all of sports and that's lovingly captured in this look at how the bitterest of on court enemies later become the closest of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit Year Eleven ($59.98; Universal) -- Since this L&amp;O has always delved more into private lives, SVU has peaked much sooner than the original and it's time to call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guest star arcs from Sharon Stone and Christine Lahti onlyemphasize that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay give it dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini (PHOTOS) Natalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie Portman Reveals Engagement Ring (PHOTOS) 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed For Second...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pending Comments View FAQSNL: The Best Of Eddie Murphy/Adam Sandler ($14.98 each; Lionsgate) -- New editions of these greatest hits compilations, both with an extra 20 minutes of sketches added in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been a long time since they were originally released, still it's a shame the "extra" footagewasn't just included in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you're a fan and didn't buy the earlier set, it'spretty much fool proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you did buy the earlier set and aren't certain if you should buy it again, ask yourself this question: do you know all the words to The Hanukkah Song?" If so, buy it. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features topjournalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back of DVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does not obligate me in any way to speak positively or negatively of their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: Casey Affleck Premieres Joaquin Phoenix Film In Venice VENICE, Italy â€” A buzz preceded actor Casey Affleck's directorial debut, "I'm Still Here": Was the movie about brother-in-law Joaquin Phoenix'sseemingly downward spiral from...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jessica Alba's Pouf &amp; Lanvin Dress: Love It Or Leave It?

Allen has often cited Hope as a major influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In movies like this one, along with Hope'sother "My Favorite" pictures ("Blonde," "Brunette" ) and "Monsieur Beaucaire, " you can see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With "Sleeper" and "Love and Death," especially , Allen paid homage to Hope's bragging coward who fancies himself a ladies' man--even using some of Hope's physical mannerisms . "Love and Death" is basically a Bob Hope movie for Russian Lit. majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haven't thought of the Ellery Queen show since I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember the mysteries being cleverly worked out, but that the character of Queen was yes, "genial," yet not at allcompelling in the way that Levinson and Link's greatest creation, Columbo, was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The showwas more like an amusing braintease r, like a crossword puzzle or a game of chess (love that DVD cover artwork), than a drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also recall John Hillerman, one of my favorite character players, being his usual urbane self as Queen's arch-nemes is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading and commenting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're absolutely right about Woody Allen's love for Bob Hope and how he modeled early roles on Hope's persona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also more fun to watch My Favorite Spy than most recent Allen movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright Â© 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recency | Popularity 3fingerbrown 07:20 AM on 10/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:40 PM on 10/07/2010 Permalink | Share itComments are closed for this entry View All</p>
