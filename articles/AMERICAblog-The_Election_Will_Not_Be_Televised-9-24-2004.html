                <p>F R I D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 2 4 , 2 0 0 4The Election Will Not Be Televisedby Michael in New York on 9/24/2004 03:11:00 AMAnother story, this one from the LA Times, about the travails of allthose faulty computer voting machines.Now, here's a prediction: we won't know the winner of the election onElection Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, I'm not predicting another Florida-like imbroglio,though that's hardly out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a lot of factors make mebelieve it will be days if not longer after the election before a winneris agreed upon.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both parties are encouraging absentee ballots - especially inbattleground states like Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Absentee ballots take longer to countand don't even have to arrive by election day.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I believe Kerry will win substantially across the nation-- not by massive margins but consistently, a firm repudiation of Bushand a clear mandate for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But poll after poll shows a very tightrace in a number of states, so those absentee ballots might verylikely hold the margin of victory if it is a close race.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both parties are fielding a record number of lawyers and pollwatchers, all of them ready to pounce on any irregularities and filecourt challenges.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The flurry of new computerized election equipment in the wake ofFlorida and the widespread problems with them in the primaries aregoing to crop up even more in the general election.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black voters still seething with anger over anecdotal stories ofpressure to stay away from the polls last time, of accurate reports ofhaving their names improperly being removed from lists of validvoters, of accurate stories about state police in Florida being sent to"question" and intimidate elderly black voters are going to raise aholy noise at the slightest sign of similar tactics in November.All of this will contribute to an election day with more challenges inmore states to election results and more questions about whethertight races could be swung by the unknown quantities of absenteeballots and court orders for recounts and more and more confusion.The result? We will NOT know who the next President of the UnitedStates is going to be on election day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again.You heard it here first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Homeschool ElectionSearch multiple engines for homeschoolelectionwww.webcrawler.comOfficial Franken PetitionAct now and help make Al Franken the nextSenator from Minnesota!democratsenators.org/obamaGay Personals DatingFind Gay Singles Near You.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free To BrowseSingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Search Now!www.ProusSingles.net Add New Comment HuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -President Obama has seized upon North Korea'smissile launch to talk about a new approach tonuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most people agree with theswell commonplac...21 minutes agoDaily Kos"Difference isn't a threat" - Dave Neiwert, theblogosphere's leading expert on the eliminationistmovement, has a typically excellent post about theweekend's tragic shooting at Croo...24 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...47 minutes agoEschatonMonday Night Thread - I wonder if Peter will dosomething stupid on Heroes tonight.1 hour agoFiredoglakeFDL Movie Night Welcomes John Holowach: High:The True Tale of American Marijuana - Last month,Attorney General Eric Holder said the federalgovernment would stop raiding marijuanadistributors in states where it is legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But lastweek H...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All Compensation WhitepaperImplement Effective CompensationPractices During an Economic CrunchSumTotalSystems.com/CompensationMama Voted for ObamaNew children's book!
