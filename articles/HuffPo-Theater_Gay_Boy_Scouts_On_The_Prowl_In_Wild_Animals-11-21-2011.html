Not in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later diversions from the heart of the matter include Jacob's rambling tale to Walter of how he and Matthew reignited their friendship after years of drifting apart or scenes of Scoutmaster Rodney dealing with neighborhood abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That merely reminds us that we should know more about Jacob and Matthew's relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They chat online but does Matthew ignore Jacob in school? Or has he truly befriended him?We just don't know and that's not right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other questions abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's strange: Walter realizes his son Matthew has probably done questionable things but instead of apologizing to Rodney he wants to know why the hell a gay man would join the Scouts, as if the very actwere suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reason propounded by the playwright is a vague cliche about a dead lover who wasan Artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what's the mystery? Unless one believes a gay man can't be around teenage boys without preying on them, why is it so puzzling that an adult who loves the outdoors and wants to share that appreciation would become a Scout leader? Can't Rodney just say he loves the Scouts and wanted tocontinue the tradition and was willing to accept the humiliating situation of having to lie in order to do so? It was a sacrifice he as an adult was ready to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We can see Jacob truly in love with Scouting as well, so it's clear how this could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, something darker might possibly be at work, as raised in the suggestive climax that is partially unearned; in a better play, it would lead to characters grappling with the questions raised, rather thanjust raising them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, director Trip Cullman scores in the scenes where something fascinating is going on and adds detail and polish to the scenes that don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scenic design by Andromache Chalfant makes effective use of video projection of stylized settings to suggest the anonymity of the suburbs and thestarkness of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes of Jenny Mannis are spot-on, though Scout uniforms are the sexiestthing on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitz Patton's sound design usefully sets the mood, especially in the key camping moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the lighting by David Weiner is very strong throughout, capturing the subtle shifts in mood and the dangerous switch from intimate to intimacy, from sexy to scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

Does Rodney want to be a positive mentor? Does Jacob reach out to him for support? Not discovering how these two might relate to each other isn't just a wasted opportunity; it's a gap that feels wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also wasted are Breen, the marvelous Ripley and Sherman, all portraying relatively minor roles, ones with little depth or interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Behlmann is very good as Rodney, capturing both his sincere love of nature and Scouting while quietly hinting how this intense connection might be a substitute for something lacking in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Johnson is magnetic and mercurial as Matthew. reveling in this character's many layers, the excitement over his burgeoning sex appeal and the power that gives him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can't keep your eyes off him, which is exactly how he likes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Chinglish * 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Godspell ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Lake Water ** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Man And Boy * 1/2 Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies ** Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 One Arm *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Private Lives ** Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Radio City Christmas Spectacular ** 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Seminar ** Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Silence!
