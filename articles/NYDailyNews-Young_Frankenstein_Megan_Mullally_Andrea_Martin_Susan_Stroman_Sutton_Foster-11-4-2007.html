                <p>ilffiVffiR, ST'Offi,Ys{ d =o i12 oz fo E oc o cure, they're following a legend- ary Broadway hit True, "The New Mel Brooks Musical Young Frankenstein" (as the full title goes, opening Thursday at the Hilton Theater, 214 \ l 42nd St ) is based on the classic 1974 comedy by writer-director, and now theatrical hit- meister, Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, yes, soy it: Expec- tations and ticket prices are monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Brooks, director/choreographer Susan Stroman and their leading ladres - Sutton Foster as Inga, frisky assistant to Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frederick Frankenstein (Rog- er Baft); Megan Mullally as the good doctor's fianc6e; and Andrea Martin as housekeeper Frau Blucher (cue horses) - aren't feeling any high anxiery "They're all very different women," says Stroman "AlI three are talented and all tlrree can do it all l'hey can sing. dance and are funny. ln Mel Brooks' world, the key to successful casting is to get people who are one-of-a-kind " Surtton Foster: Unearthinq her inner vixen o3q z = r oo N ! E o c"l'm underneath some hay in the wagon 1br about a min- ute and a half before I pop up," says Foster "And then ev- ery night I get to pel1om this fantastic number You rarely get to yodel these days on Broadway." YodelayJte-ho, indeed, As the delightfully lusty Inga, Foster wears a blond wig and a nurse's uniform so shoft those in the front rows may Deed Dr FranJrenstein's life-re- viving equipment But don't expect Inga to attach the elec- trodes herself - she's busy cavorting (and yodeling) in "Roll in The Hay," a number that also requires her to shim- my around a giant, rollicking cafi "Oh, the layers of Inga, What does she want? Sex!" Inga cefiainly doesn't get jealous when her lover's fiancd Eliza- beth (Mutlally) shows up "InBa's European!" says Foster, laughing "She's like, 'Oh, nice to meet you Wanna join?"' Striving Broadway sexpots might be jealous of Foster, 32, if she wasn't so sweet - and talenLed Her storybook car eer began by making her debut on the Great S/hite Way next to her brother, Hunier Foster, in a revivai of "Grease " (Huntel, coincidentallv is now in an unrelated, dramat- ic musical version of "Frankenstein" off-Broadwav) Thatwas quickly followed by a classic big break; The Iead dropped out of a new musical and Foster was pulled from the chorus to star in "Thoroughly Modern lVlillie," winning a Tony in 2002 for Best LeadingActress in a Musical (and the love of her "Millie" co-star Christian Borle. now her husband) She's since played Jo in "Little Women" and a cafi-wheeling ingenue in "The Drowsy Chaperone " Foster says she's loving the opportunity to be a Tran- sylvanian sexpot, and isn't afraid of Teri Gan's Inga in Brooks' 1974 movie - she's devoured it again and again "lt's my favorite of his movies," says Foster "I saw it for the first time a couple of years ago with a group of people who knew every Iine I'LI watch certain sections to get little r eminders You get inspired with little ideas and moments "'Ihe film is so emblazoned in people's minds that we have to honor it There's a reason why it worked " And she loves the anlthing-goes spirit of Brooks and Stronan, who each won Tonys for "The Producers " In previews, she says, "Chris Fitzgerald, as lgor, had an idea tbr one of his entrances, to hang upside down Next thing I know, they actually built something for him to hang from "il 'i X r" I tt .1, I .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; P(r) o 2ID zo{ ir" Mggan Mullally: Her, ngr, ner, ner! Mullally - fomerly the martini-swili- ing, sntrky Karen Walker on TV's "Will &amp; Grace" - feels almost guilty about her big numbers as Elizabeth in "Young Franken- stein " ln the role played by Madeline Kahn in the movie, Mullally has grand entrances in fabulous gowns (or hilarious fright wigs), dives into the comic numbers "Please Don't Touch Me," "Surprise" (in which she comes on stage trilling, "lt's me, me, me, me!") and "Deep Love," in which she professes her devotion to the Monster, played by Shul- er Hensley - and then walks off with flair, clacking her heels with every step "l just swan around, and then go back to my dressing room and buy things online," jokes Mullally. "I feel like I'm getting away with something, because it's so fun " "l was dling to come to New York and do a musical," she says "It's the most fun on and offstage because it's so silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was the best possible job I could have gotten " Mullally's co-stars say they were a bit nervous about meeting Brooks, but not hen "Mel and I have a groovy kind of love," says Mullatly,48 "We have a good banter- ing relationship I always tell him he's a fim second position tbr my affections if some- thing should falt through with my husband "I wasn't intimidated by him at all I don't get intimidated that easily an;more." Of course, that wtr before rehearsals. "The f,rst day we sat around a table to do a read-through And Mel was being really hard on two guys in the ensemble and being reqlly specific with them and giving notes Andrea Martin was sitting next to me. and my scene was the next [coming upl She Mote a note to me sayi ng: 'It's been nice knowing you.' Then we became hysterical " Like everyone else, Mullallv was a huge fan of the film version, even though she hadn't seen it in vears She doesn't dive into it again and again like Foster does, but she doesn't avoid it like Martin And once, she couldn't have missed it if she tried "l got the call to audition and the next day flew tl om Los Angeles to New York, and in first class, they give you a little DVD player - and 'Young Frankenstein' was one of the movies How weird is that?" So, that was a good sign? Mullally laughs, "Or a slap in the /dcc!" she says "4 Andrea Martin: What a Blucher Usually, actors audition and campaign for a role With the famously indecisive Andrea Martin, it's often the other way around "Stro ldirector Susan Stroman] called me and said, 'Don't speak lor 10 minutes,"' says Martin "And then she told me about the show and the role of Frau Bluch er and why she wanted me to do it Finally, I said, 'Can I speak yet?"' A key member of the legendary Second City TV troupe in the late '70s and early '80s, Martin admitsthat she has hemmed and hawed a bit about taking on roles in "Candide," "Fiddler on the Roof "and "The Rose Tattoo,".among other productions On open- ing night of an Encoresl performance of "Out of this Wortd," she told her director she absolutely, positively couldn't go on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with all those shows, she could and did Once she commits, Martin, 60, is all in It has paid otf, too: She had the opportunity to do dramatic turns in "Oklahoma" and "Rose Tattoo," won a Tony for "My Favorite Year" and garnered nominations aplenty- Her take on Frau Blucher - a housekeeper so fiercesome that every time her name is mentioned ("BIucher!') horses rear up and neigh in dismay - is tlpically com- mitted She says she has avoided watching the movieversion again, and Cloris Leachman's iconic Blucher "I'n very impressionable," says Martin For inspiration, the actress instead has a still from Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 classic "Rebecca," which fea- tures Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers, an equally creepy, intimidating housekeeper But Mrs Danvers certainly didn't break into a gooty Marlene Dietrich- ish musical number like "He Vas My Boy.friend," in which the Transylvanian Blucher recounts her passion for young Frmkenstein's grandfather, "I'm just glad that song comes early in the show," confesses Martin "If I had to spend the entire evening knowing that flater] I was going to be doing that number, I couldn't think of anlthing else " OIo P ol oo lo = F z? @ c f o o zo l o Noo{</p>
