                <p>M O N D A Y , M A R C H 1 4 , 2 0 0 5Demand The MSM Do Its Jobby Michael in New York on 3/14/2005 01:39:00 AMI know we've talked about USA Next and even this particularpiece a lot, but here's a link to the Sunday NYT Magazineinterview with chief executive of USA Next Charlie Jarvis.This is what constitutes the "hard-hitting" section:Critics say your organization is not a legitimate lobbying groupbut a front for those who want to privatize Social Security,including Karl Rove, the president's chief strategist.I have never had a one-to-one meeting with him.What about a two-to-one meeting?I've met him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think he is a political and tactical genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'vebeen in presentations by him at the White House briefings.Does he know your name?Now he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He would say, of course: ''Charlie Jarvis was theone who was in that interview in The New York TimesMagazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how did he blow that interview so badly?''-- all per NYTSo USA Next gets a full-page profile in the NYT, talking to its mainman about their "lobbying strategy" and otherwise completelylegitimizing them as for real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet there have been numerousdifferent news stories detailing the following:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA Next is the latest in a string of "lobbying" groups run by thesame people whose sole purpose seems to be raising money withfear-mongering letters to old people so it can pay its top leaders bigsalaries and keep raising more money.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA Next repeatedly claims a membership of 1.5 million but ismostly funded by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does it claim 1.5million members because that's how many old people it sendsmisleading junk mail to in an attempt to raise money?3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA Next is credited with engineering "the recent controversial adthat branded AARP pro-gay marriage....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What else are you planning?"said the NYT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, a correct description is that they launched anoutrageous and absurd smear against the AARP that gained lots ofattention but backfired in their faces by making charges so ludicrous(that the AARP is somehow anti-military) that they were roundlycriticized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also did it by apparently breaking the law and arefacing a multi-million dollar lawsuit. (This may not have been knownby deadline.)4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And before you call this liberal bashing, the Bush Administrationitself (through the Social Security Administration) has fined USA Nextmore than $500,000 for fradulent mailings to old people that scaredand defrauded them in an attempt to raise money for itself.So why is this group being treated like a legitimate lobbyingorganization? There should be NO articles about their work as alobbying group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There should be LOTS of articles about its record offraud and deceit, of being fined by Bush for scaring and intimidatingold people, of how it is ANTI-elderly (Bush says so).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing they doshould be given legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their entire past -- which apparentlyincludes numerous similar self-perpetuating fund-raising businessesgeared towards the elderly -- should be detailed at length.Instead, the NYT blesses them with a profile that paints it as a player,a mover and shaker on the national scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't delve into thegroup's shady past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gives it cover for the future -- your elderlygrandparents could read this and think that when they get a letterfrom USA Next in the mail, it's a real group, rather than scam artistswho have been fined by the Bush Administration itself.The only way to stop this is by asking the NYT and any media outletthat covers them as a real lobbying group rather than shysters about Daily KosIOKIYAPI (It's OK If You're A Private Insurer) -Here's William Kristol revealing the *horrors*hidden within the health care bill as it emergedfrom the HELP committee...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Kennedy and hisco-autho...1 minute ago Ben SmithObama: Cambridge police acted 'stupidly' - Afterspending most of an hour patiently reiterating hisarguments for changing the health insurancesystem, President Barack Obama turned his press8 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsThe Wrong Reporter Asks Obama A Question - Thechance to ask a question during a prime-timepresidential press conference is treasured realestate in the world of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when thePresident...17 minutes ago Paul KrugmanProfessor in chief - I found Obama's health carepresentation so impressive - so much command ofthe issues - that it had me worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I really like apoliticians' speech, is...28 minutes ago EschatonObama Speaks - In Case You Missed It37 minutes agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T VDemand Sensing TechnologyDemand Sensing cuts forecast errorin half, improving cash flow.www.TerraTechnology.comRod Blagojevich SuperstarSince when is breaking a few lawsillegal?chicagoshakes.com/superstarCoverbind USA SuppliesCoverbind, Bind-it, &amp; Unibind SalesThermal Binding Covers &amp; Equipwww.ThermoBinding.com Next 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Dema...http://www.americablog.com/2005/03/demand-msm-do-its-job.html 1 of 57/22/09 10:19 PMVisit ourAMERICAblog TV site.see all 322 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod For the GOPers, healthcare is politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just Traditional media has todebunk the birthers One small step...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The right-wing media, thevoices of the GOP, in REM - Orange CrushAMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Dema...http://www.americablog.com/2005/03/demand-msm-do-its-job.html 2 of 57/22/09 10:19 PMEzra KleinTab Dump2 hours agoWonk RoomSen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Byron Dorgan:The â€˜Tradeâ€™ InCap-And-Trade â€˜MakesNo Sense To Meâ€™4 hours agoHealth BeatTruth Squad: WallStreet Journal HealthCare Editorial Wrong onthe Facts . . .4 hours agoThe TreatmentHatch Is Out6 hours agoDaily DoseProviders Endorse 'Payfor Value' Proposals12 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
