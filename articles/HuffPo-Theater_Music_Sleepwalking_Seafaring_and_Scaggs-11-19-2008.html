Less than aplay? Who cares? Shows like this are far more common in the UK, where stand-up is more vibrantand people with solid success start playing small theaters for limited runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not all of them shape anevening with quite the skill that Birgbiglia brings to his modest story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if it's funny, it's funnyand no one worries too much about what to call it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Birbiglia is funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not necessarily clamoringto hear what he'll come up with next, but I am intrigued enough to keep him in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone whocan wring laughs out of the low-key repetition of the phrase "I know" has a gift for aligning anaudience with his own slanted view of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad, however, that he didn't don pajamas for theperformance, as in the poster for the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a guy who readily embraces an unflatteringdescription of himself, Birbiglia sure looks sweet in his jammies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just make certain he's wrapped up tight in his sleeping bag before you doze off: you do not want a loose Birbiglia in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times' Neil Genzlinger said: "Mike Birbiglia's pacing is simply perfect in "Sleepwalk With Me," his funny, appealing one-man show."Variety's Sam Thielman said: "Birbiglia's delivery is terrific -- his not-that-bright everyman routine Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

The New York Post's Frank Scheck gave it three out of four stars and said: "At times, the stand-up roots show through too blatantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But under Seth Barrish's capable direction, Birbiglia manages to pull the thematic elements together by, among other things, framing the evening with stories abouthis relationship with his emotionally reserved father." The AP's Peter Santilli said: "During the 90-minute performance, it gradually becomes clear "Sleepwalk With Me" is something greater than simply good standup comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Birbiglia displays an uncanny ability to be hilarious, terrifying and poignant -- all in the same breath." Theatermania's David Finkle said: "As he digresses to talk about turning off cell phones, his slow sexual development, his cautious father and gregarious mother, his hypochondria, an actual cancerous tumor in the bladder caught in time and other subjects that could be called ephemeral,he recalls Woody Allen's nebbishy persona, Steven Wright's cerebral musings, and even the mannerin which Sam Levenson giggled at his own jokes." CATALPA -- Another one-man show, Catalpa tells the daring, true story of the rescue of six Irish prisoners in 1875 ( here's a NYTimes article from the period ) from under the nose of the British by a crew that sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts to a penal colony in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actor Donal O'Kelly holds the Irish Arts Center stage easily, just like he reportedly did some 20 years ago when he firs appeared in New York at the same location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Kelly jokes that's less of a career arc and moreof a horizontal line, but there's something inspiring about a talented actor simply doing the work.The work in question is unnecessarily framed -- very briefly -- as a movie pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Kelly impliesHollywood executives proved uninterested in this thrilling story and he gets his revenge by actingout the script, occasionally tossing in ideas (like which movie star could play the female lead) butmostly giving himself the easy, uninteresting option of using film script language ("a wideshot thatmoves in swiftly on a ship that..." is sort of typical).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While this lets O'Kelly indulge in some broadbrushstrokes quite effectively for some characters, it mostly just keeps the story at an emotionaldistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also constrasts sharply with his playful use of word and sound he delights in; therichest moments are when O'Kelly makes a song out of someone's name or repeats a syllable overand over until you can almost see the roiling waves of the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, I'd rather hear the showstripped of its movie script conventions and recorded as a radio play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe the Hollywood suitswere right after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Variety's Sam Thielman said: "All in all, it's an improbably beautiful show, especially considering O'Kelly has only a white sheet hanging from a pipe and Ronan Fingleton's lights to paint a picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The really gorgeous visuals of "Catalpa" take place in our heads, with the singing, declaiming, gesticulating O'Kelly the touchstone." Theatermania's Patrick Lee said: "Donal O'Kelly seems to rejoice in the musicality of spoken words and in their capacity to paint visual pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This infectious love of language fills the two-hour show with precisely chosen words that paint visual pictures for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately O'Kellyhas far more success rendering these little pictures than with painting the big one: the story getsaway from him." BOZ SCAGGS AT THE BLUE NOTE -- Somebody mentioned famous singers who have tackled standards, listing Rod Stewart and Boz Scaggs together, which is enough to depress any serious vocalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though pop singers can become accomplished in tackling the American Songbook, few have done it with such immediate grace and insight as Scaggs, who first delivered an album ofstandards five years ago with the impeccable But Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His new Decca release Speak Low is just as sublime, this time adding more ambitious arrangements to the quiet intimacy it's nosurprise he gravitated to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scaggs came to the Blue Note recently, one of the few remaining tinyclubs in New York where you can see a show with a serious audience that pays attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despitetranscendent versions of classics like "Harbor Lights," my only quibble is that I would havepreferred a set much longer and solely devoted to the classics (as opposed to his classics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Scaggs duetted with the stylish, beautifully restrained backup singer Mone't or played lightly with "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

Variety said: "Scaggs was ably abetted by the tasteful reedmen Bob Sheppard and Paul McCandless, each of whom moved fluidly between instruments, most notably on a subtly abstracted version of "Save Your Love for Me." Thanks to their collective light touch -- as well as the singer's own easy mien -- a vibrant buoyancy permeated just about every groove of a breezy set that positively flew by."
