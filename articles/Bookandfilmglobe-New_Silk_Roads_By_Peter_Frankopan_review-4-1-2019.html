                <p>Saturday, April 6, 2019  NON-FICTION The Second Time As Farce Historians Should Learn From History and Not Try to Predict the Future  April 1, 2019 Michael Giltz Peter Frankopan , a professor of global history at Oxford, enjoyed tremendous success with a one-volume history of the world titled The Silk Roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acclaim and bestseller-dom greeted Frankopan’s desire to open Western eyes to the East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was indeed illuminating and one of my favorites of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he’s delivered another book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, The New Silk Roads isn’t a work of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankopan took a stab at current events and failed on most every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might say that history didn’t repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very typical passage: “Such successes do not scratch the surface of what is going on in India and China, whose adoption rates of newfinancial technologies (FinTech) for money transfers and payments,savings and investments and borrowing are far higher than any othercountry in the world – including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In both countries, the scope forgrowth seems to be almost limitless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ant Financial, hived off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba before the latter floated in the world’s largestinitial public offering (or IPO) in history in 2014, is itself preparing toundertake a fundraising round that will value the cashless paymentPeter Frankopanbusiness at a jaw-dropping $150bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This makes the valuation of India’s Paytm (in which Alibaba is a shareholder) of just $10bn lookconservative – not bad for a company only founded a few months beforePrince William and Kate Middleton got engaged in autumn 2010.” Whew! Here we see a number of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankopan throws in unnecessary slang like FinTech and IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andhe doesn’t provide the context for why India and China are leapfrogging the US on mobile payments: their banking systems can’t reach hundreds of millions of people, many of whom would never trust a bank anyway.Such context complicates the picture in an interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankopan really falls down with the last two sections, when he rather helplessly deals with President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historian that he is, Frankopan seems wedded to the idea that Trump must have some sort of plan orideology beyond chaos and personal gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, he says that even if you take Trump out of the equation, the U.S. has abandoned its allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the rise in U.S. prestige around the world under President Obama, that feels like a rather bizarre claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankopan alsofails to mention major international cooperation on substantial issues from Iran to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To top it off,he unfairly conflates Secretary Of State Madeleine Albright’s reasonable concern over the rise of fascism with axenophobic fear of China’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Albright, Frankopan doesn’t understand what current events may have long-term impact and which are insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has one message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rising countries of the East are optimistic and working together, whilethe West is fearful and fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a useful point, but one lost in a blur of factoids and misjudgments.Frankopan needs a good hundred years to mull this over, let the dust settle, and then try again.← Hotel Hell Is Catastrophe Really the Show We Need Right Now? → (Knopf, March 26, 2019) Tags: New Silk Roads, Peter Frankopan , Silk Roads Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for the New York Post, New York DailyNews, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Huffington Post, Premiere Magazine,Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He co-hosts the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox Showbiz Sandbox. You May Also LikeA Nation of Greater Fools?  November 3, 1999 Bob Mould FuckingRules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And So Does His Memoir.  June 25, 2011 A Charming, Frequently Hilarious Memoir  January 16, 2013 Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required fields are marked * Comment Name *Email * WebsiteSubscribe to our mailing list SocialTwitter Facebook Recent Posts Dead and Buried ‘Shazam!’: a Man-Boy Superhero for the Man-Boys You’re Getting Very Sleepy I Say: Let ‘Em Crash Broadened City Recent Comments L.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deyo on ‘Shazam!’: a Man-Boy Superhero for the Man-Boys jahozer on No One Feels Sorry For Laurel and Hardy Ron on No One Feels Sorry For Laurel and Hardy Today's Cheap Trick News - March 26, 2019 - Cheap Trick Fan on Sympathy for The DirtOmar L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gallaga on The Eyes Don’t Have It Archives April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018August 2018 July 2018 May 2017 February 2016 May 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014March 2014 December 2013 September 2013 April 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012July 2012 November 2011 September 2011 June 2011 May 2011 March 2011 May 2001March 2001 October 2000 August 2000 July 2000 June 2000 February 2000 January 2000December 1999November 1999 October 1999 September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999 March 1999February 1999 September 1998 June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 February 1998 October 1997September 1997 August 1997 June 1997 May 1997 April 1997 March 1997 February 1997January 1997 November 1996 September 1996 August 1996 June 1996 May 1996 April 1996February 1996January 1996 October 1995 August 1995 February 1995 January 1995 Copyright © 2019, Book and Film GlobeAbout Us | Terms &amp; Conditions | Privacy Policy | Advertise with us |CONTACT INFO EDITOR – Neal Pollack – neal@bookandfilmglobe.com GENERAL MANAGER/ADVERTISING – Kevin Sanders – ksanders@seaofreedsllc.com – 201-724-0340 VISIT OUR SUITE OF SITES</p>
