                <p>W E D N E S D AY, S E P T E M B E R 1 3 , 2 0 0 6"The Wire" Begins Season Four; Renewed ForFifth And Final SeasonWell, I've given HBO plenty of grief for cancelling "Deadwood"prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at least they haven't made the same mistake twice.(And for various reasons, my rule of thumb is that you can't bedisappointed over the cancelling of a show if it's had three seasonscause three seasons is usually as far as any drama should go creativelyand clearly it had a shot ratings-wise.) "The Wire" has just begun airingSeason Four and hallelujah, HBO has already renewed the show for itsfifth and final season.The reviews for season four have been phenomenal -- and welldeserved, based on the first six of twelve episodes that I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'smulti-layered, complex, subtle, and takes a while to build, this series.You can't multitask while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's best to watch it with a friendbecause you can parse out the plot twists together or ask what acharacter has just mumbled (and if you can't figure it out and arewatching a DVD, use the subtitle function).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, it ain't immediatelyaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just gripping, funny, unexpected, moving, depressingand real.Season One dealt with a wiretap on an inner city drug ring inBaltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Two focused on the ports and unions andcorruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Three dealt with politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Four is looking atthe school system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Season Five will look at the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That allsounds very dry -- every season revolves around a core group ofwonderful characters on every side of the law, with the principalplayers shifting from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lead character of one season --say McNulty -- will become a secondary character the next year.Literally every character is fascinating, so you are always thrilled to bedealing with whomever is front and center --but at the end of a show ora season, you'll say damn, I miss McNulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many shows paint withsuch a broad canvas? Almost none.It's the next step in smart, sophisticated television, the way "Hill StreetBlues" was some 26 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the old days, if a showlike "Twin Peaks" or "24" or "St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elsewhere" had already been on the airfor a year or two, you felt like it was too late to join the bandwagonNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "The Wire" Begins Season Four; Renew...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/09/wire-begins-season-four... 1 of 37/28/09 7:01 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SBiboyAaronMichael in New York POPSURFING.COM: "The Wire" Begins Season Four; Renew...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/09/wire-begins-season-four... 2 of 37/28/09 7:01 PMPOPSURFING.COM: "The Wire" Begins Season Four; Renew...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/09/wire-begins-season-four... 3 of 37/28/09 7:01 PM</p>
