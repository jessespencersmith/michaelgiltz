(Almost.) Author Zen Cho soon raises the stakes: the fairykingdom is blocking the flow of magic into England, France is poised to take advantage, numerous men are plottingto remove Zacharias from office or kill him or both and if all that isn't enough Zacharias has the absurd idea thatwomen (women!) should be trained in the magical arts rather than tamped down or punished if they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course,the woman he discovers that is bursting with talent would prove to be willful with all sorts of ideas of her own andbeautiful to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a commoner! Author Zen Cho has great fun with all the layers of silliness going on here, fromgrumpy old witches to dragons to plotting fairies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the romance at its heart is nicely kept at a low simmer while thegenuine complications from race and class and gender prove stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's funny, something one rarely saysabout fantasy once you're past the age of 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The humor is in fact the book's strongest suit, along with the fact thatour heroine Prunella is wonderfully talented but sometimes willfully dumb (it's tiresome to have a protagonist who ismore powerful, more beautiful AND smarter than everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scenes where the females bustle about andpractically ignore the hapless men around them are especially rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a good book and it's possible Cho coulddeepen her world and her plotting and make the next one even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're a fan of fantasy AND romance, whyyou'd be foolish not to dive in. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“An enchanting cross between Georgette Heyer and Susanna Clarke, full of delights and surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zen Cho unpinsthe edges of the canvas and throws them wide.”—Naomi Novik, New York Times bestselling author of the Temerairenovels“A delightful and enchanting novel that uses sly wit and assured style to subvert expectations while it always,unfailingly, entertains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved it!”—Kate Elliott, author of the Spiritwalker series“A deliciously true tale of politics and power in a charming, cruel world—it demands and deserves to be read againand again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cho has humor and flair to match Pratchett and Heyer plus her own marvelous style.”—Karen Lord,author of The Best of All Possible Worlds “Inventive, dangerous, brilliant, unsettling, and adorable, all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It shatters as many rules as itscharacters do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historical Britain will never be the same again, and I can't wait for the next book.”—Courtney Milan,New York Times and USA Today bestselling author“Fast-paced and witty...Should appeal to fans of Mary Robinette Kowal and Gail Carriger.”—Elizabeth Bear, author ofSteles of the Sky</p>
