Will it be with the sexy tattoo artist Antwoine (LeRoy McClain) who seems to have it all together? Or will Annie find religion via the awkward and earnest fellow student Keera (Adrienne C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore)? Milk Like Sugar becomes less distinctive the further away it moves from that sharp-tongued almost satirical opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the talent on display is too good to ever let your attention wander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lewis is nicely tentative as she struggles to express the confusion and desires in her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mallory-McCree has the mostthankless role as the do-gooder Malik; despite a modest edge to his passion, Malik is merely an idea ofescape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McClain on the other hand makes Antwoine fully realized and not so dangerous as you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pinkins nails her scenes with authority though Annie has so much stacked against her it feels like cheating when Annie's mom switches from beaten-down to mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the same way, the show builds to a rousing climax where the walls -- a distinctive element in Mimi Lien's strong but spare set design -- areliterally closing in on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then the show retreats to a softer epilogue where the fates of all thecharacters are spelled out and we're given two or three reasons to hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toni-Leslie James had a blast with the costumes, the sound design and original music by Andre Pluess is terrifically good, and the lighting by Justin Townsend keys the changing emotions with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, director Rebecca Taichman mines the material for all its worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scene changes in particular show her inventiveness and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chairs and other props are moved on and off by characters butTaichman uses those silent moments to have different actors react and play off of each other in meaningful, telling ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the talent raised their game and gave the words of Greenidge the best possible showcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOVE'S LABOR'S LOST ** 1/2 THE PUBLIC THEATER The Public Lab is one of the best bargains in town with $15 tickets to new plays and classics given an enthusiastic airing by fresh talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This production of Love's Labor's Lost is a good example: it's a pretty good retelling of Shakespeare's romance with enough good performers on display to make you forgiveany inconsistencies or ideas that don't quite pan out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karin Coonrod has certainly staged this play with energy: the actors are literally running around the entire theater, acting on the stairs, the walkways behind the audience and occasionally even on the stage itself, which is a modest affair with a patch of green in the middle and little else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The King Oof Navarre (a fine Hoon Lee) wants to devote himself to study and convinces three friends to take a pledge and avoideven the sight of women, much less any pleasure, while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berowne (an excellent Nick Westrate) isMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

Glover's dad relishes his meanness and cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't need to be forcedto admit it -- he loudly proclaims it every minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He insults and demeans everyone around him everyminute of every day and gleefully acknowledges it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what possible cathartic moment could the son be hoping for? His dad KNOWS he's a prick; it's in fact his defining characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He would be upset if you didn't think he was a prick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So this hoped for powerful moment has zero impact since it doesn't revealanything the dad and we don't already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glover leads with his crotch in this show (if you saw his performance, you'd know what I mean) and in some inexplicable way manages to create a genuine character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps that he has the meanest, mostvivid bits of dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the fuzzier role of the mother who is both less and more than she seems, Burstyn like everyone else struggles and fails to make sense of the show -- and the even worse show within a show that we catch glimpses of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Melissa Ross somehow gins up some emotion as the sister,which is a small miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But these are small passing moments of interest and not nearly enough to rescue the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the tech elements are out of kilter because they are desperate to do something with a floundering work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Schlesinger of the marvelous Fountains Of Wayne devises desperate cues in his score that can't create drama where none exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set feels random and director Pam McKinnon (soon to be seenon Broadway with an acclaimed revival of Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf) is at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A couch is themain bit of furniture and it's rotated this way and that with sometimes the actors standing in front of it and sometimes behind it and sometimes even to the side of it to no effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One scene brings the show to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For whatever reason, the play and the play within the play are utterlyTOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 More Entertainment News at THR.com More Celebrity News at People.comFor Bodysuits (Photos) Cynthia Nixon: Max Will Try His First Thanksgiving Stuffing READ MORE Kim Kardashian'sThanksgiving Contribution?Sweet Potato SoufflÃƒÂ© READ MORE Heidi Klum Takes Her Kidsto Katy Perry's Concert READ MORE 'TOWIE' Star Amy Childs Opens a Salon George Michael in Hospital Asylum Snowtown Interview The Greatest Guitar Player Of All Time Revealed!
