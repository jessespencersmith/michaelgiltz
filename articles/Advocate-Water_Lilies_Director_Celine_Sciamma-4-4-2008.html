I really enjoy writing too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The future will tell.” Water Lilies looks at three very different girls: Anne, a heavyset girl exceptionally eager to lose her virginity; Floriane, a sexy girl who loves to flirt but is a little overwhelmed by the effect her body has on boys and older men; and our heroine, Marie (a gawky Pauline Acquart), who isfriends with Anne but obsessed with Floriane as only a teenager on hormones can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one hilariously driven scene, Anne is so besotted with Floriane that Anne steals her trash and even eats scraps of food that Floriane has thrown away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an unexpected way, Sciamma is using homosexuality to get viewers to see the story of first love with fresh eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Story continues on next page...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page: 1 | 2 READER COMMENTS These comments are reproduced as written by visitors to this Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have not been edited for content, grammar, or spelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The viewpoints appearing here are those of the writer, and donot necessarily reflect the opinion or views of advocate.com, The Advocate , or its affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the first to comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUBMIT A COMMENT FOR THIS STORY: *Type your comment here (Required, 1000 characters max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HTML formatting and hyperlinks are NOT permitted.): FROM THE NEWSSTAND ISSUE Great Expectations Editor's Letter Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President, Here’s Another Thing toChange A-List: Nathan LaneToo Girly to Be Girls?Work It Out Reel Travel Southwest SojournWeHo Without Wheels A Quieter Riot Of Pastors and Politicians And on a Lighter Note The Cult of Grey GardensThe New Annuity My Little Dumpling Back AttackBoot BoysUp in Smoke Showstopping Design The New Kings of the Hill: Brad Kiley Recession?
