It’s Me, Margaret, creates a richly textured andmoving story of three generations of families, friends and strangers,whose lives are profoundly changed by unexpected events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1987, Miri Ammerman returns to her hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey,to attend a commemoration of the worst year of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thirty‐five yearsearlier, when Miri was fifteen, and in love for the first time, a succession ofairplanes fell from the sky, leaving a community reeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Against thisbackdrop of actual events that Blume experienced in the early 1950s, whenairline travel was new and exciting and everyone dreamed of goingsomewhere, she paints a vivid portrait of…Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This Book Go to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site whereyou can get this book.BookFilter12/1/2015BookFilter | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=166e9c70-ca66-41dd-b461-0ef74edb34a8&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4 Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayJudy Blume is beloved, a trailblazer, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know the drill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her preferred description is "storyteller," which iswhat every great writer should aspire to be called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that she is, as demonstrated in her latest novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could callit a novel for adults, but the little secret is that "young adult" novels aren't just for kids and "grown-up" books are justabout perfect for any teen with a head on their shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there a difference in Blume's work ostensibly gearedtowards kids versus that for adults? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her overriding goal is to tell a story, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's that honesty that hasmade Blume such a touchstone and it's on full display here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blume plumbs her childhood for a sneakily engrossingnovel that draws upon the real-life incidents that haunted Elizabeth, New Jersey: during a 58 day span, threepassenger planes crashed, one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was unnerving, frightening and frankly surreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What was going on?(It turned out to be a horrible coincidence, with no real link between the three crashes.) Blume uses that bizarrebackdrop to draw us into a tale of the town's community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins and ends with Miri, a teenager experiencing herfirst love when the crashes occur. "First love" is condescending, something Blume never does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miri believes her lovewill be her first, her last and her everything and honestly, we do too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blume takes her seriously, which makes theexcitement and heartbreak all the more believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 1950s era is captured indelibly, but it's the characters you'llremember, not the decor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins with Miri and her quietly single mother and grandmother and awesome UncleHenry and expands out and out to the not-so-perfect family of her best friend (who is deeply unnerved by thecrashes) to other romances and other lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The voices multiply and brief bookends let us know how it all turned out.But those intense weeks are the heart of this book, one that will satisfy her fans and -- even decades into her career -- win Blume some new ones. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“An ambitious book that combines adult experience with the sweet familiarity of Blume’s writing for and aboutyounger people. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel rivals Tolstoy or Ferrante in its number of characters, families, and stories, and it feelsnot just believable but like a regular preteen-style Judy Blume page-turner, emotionally resonant and down-to-earthat once. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s also the experience of being in Blume’s authoritative hands, reading a dramatic story about daily lifetold in a funny, orderly, honest style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blume is always kind to her readers; the suffering her characters experiencefeels real but never cruel, never melodramatic. . . . [Her books are] deftly crafted, and she’s done the hard work forus. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading In the Unlikely Event is like reconnecting with a long-lost friend.” —Sarah Larson, The New Yorker“In the Unlikely Event gives us everything that Blume is known (and beloved) for—the fierce, fraught nature of youngrelationships, the comfort and confines of cultural identity, the messiness and joys of the body—and takes it to a newlevel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This novel is her most ambitious to date, and she lives up to its reach with her characteristic…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
