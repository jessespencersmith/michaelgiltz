"'She never put out a Christmas CD?' Most people when they beil that proba- bly won't believe it!" laughs Love aboutthe album "But I wasn't the only one on that Spector album " (It also contained, of course, the Ronettes, the Crystals and Bob B So:or and the Blue Jeans ) "I've never actually put out an offi- cial Darlene Inve Christmas CD," says Love, whose new album tackles contem- porary holiday gems by the likes of Tom Petty, the Pretenders, XTC and others, all of which sound like classics as soon ec chp cinoe than Well. it's about time. since Ms lnve owns the holiday, "I thirk I do They call me the Chdst- mro Queen," she says "Everybody is [the royaltyl of sometling Aretha is the Queen of Soul EMs was the King of Rock 'n' Roll - and I'm the Queen of Christmas " Does that mean she could just work two months out of the vear and coast onu{:?li','.';*,m""'- ffix:f i*iv:y:::,'11..,^,, ^*ffiaU that hol.iday joy? "I've tried that, md it doesn't work," says lnve "Two months out of the year doesn't do it " plays Motomouth Maybelle in "Hairspray." She'd like to tum her Christmas concert- a l7-year tradition - into bigger extravaganza "We want to make it an evenl, Love.

"This show is trying to get you back to when Christmas was fun And for most people, the last purely happy memory of Christmas was probably when they were 8 years old " But just because she's touring with a Christmas show. don'l assume Mann is holiday crazy. "All my Christmas spirit comes from onstage," says the singer-songwriter, who won Academy Award nominations for her songs for the mov- ie "Magnolia " "Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not going to have time to buy Christmas presents " a (wednesday, Manhattan Centel crand Ballroom, 212-307-7171)Kiki &amp; Herb are comin'to town othing goes toBether like Kiki and Herb and Christmas "Somehow when we do these Christmas shows," says perfomer Justin Bond, "it manages to focus what the thrust of what Kiki and Herb are all about Created by Bond and Kenny Melman in the early '90s, Kiki and Herb are a cynically sentimental, rather inebriated duo that does wickedly fumy covers of everj,thing from Broadway tunes to Britney Spears to Niwana They're at Camegie Hall Wednesday in a new show, "The Second Coming " It'll surely be another dizzying musical iourney laced with monologues that mix autobiographical tales of how the two chilacters met in an institution in the 1930s and have blzed through the entertainment industry ever since "There's something about the holidays that Iends a pow- er to the shows that is different from what we do during the rest of the year," says Melman "There's always been a touch of sweetness to it " Tony-nominated ior their re cent Broadway run, the New York denizens' first CD, 2000's "Do You Hear What We Heat" was a Christ- mas album whose selections ranged from "Frosty the Snoman" to the iM+A*S*H' tbeme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnv Mandel's "Suicide Is Painless." I "Most people don't begin with a Christmas album," says Melman "We just thought we'd cut to the chase " "The first perfomance I ever did," adds Bond, "was when I was 18 months old and I did a little speech at a Christmas pageant That was my f,rst appearance on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So maybe it's some sort of primal perfomance thing."
