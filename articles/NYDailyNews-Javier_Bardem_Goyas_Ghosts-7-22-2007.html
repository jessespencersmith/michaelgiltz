Sure, ifyou're JavierBardem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bardem - who was nominated for an Oscar for 2000's "Before Night Falls" - has just started filming aWoodyAllen comedy in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the Cannes Film Festival in May, he enjoyed more Oscarbtrzzfor his turn as a frighteningly detached kill- er in the Coen brothers drama "No Countrv for Old Men" (due out in November).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he's currently in director Milos For- man's ("One FlewOverthe Cuckoo's Nest," "Amadeus") drama about the Spanish Inqui- sition, "Goya's Ghosts." Despite his filmography, and coming from an acting family that's akin to the Spanish Barrymores, the 38-year-old still professes delighted surprise when top direc- tors want to workwith him."That [voice] was a risk.that we took," says Bar- dem. "We wanted to make him a snalqy fi.gure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I "I think it's what keeps me alive," says Bar- dem, who has also triumphed in 2004's Oscar win- ner "The Sea Inside." "I never forget I'm a Spanish actor that was at one time working as an extra. "And because of the background of my family, I've seen the dark side and the bright side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a way, I don't buy either of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only thing I can relate to is re- spect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when people I truly admire and respect re- spect me enough to say, 'I think we could work together,' that lights something in me." Bardem seems to delight in physical and external waysof getting into character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "No Country for Old Men," his hair is styled in an Andy Warhol droop that is so ab- surd it's scary, made even mofe creepy since Bardem's character is a killer without remorse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "Goya's Ghosts," Bardem adopts awhispery meandering voice as Brother Lorenzo, a true believer at the heart of the Inquisition who conveniently becomes a true believer in revolution when Napoleon takes over Spain. wasn't there in ancient times but I was raised bythe Catholic Church and sometimes I saw right in front of my eyes that the tone was one way but the action was another." Like Forman, who left his native Czecho- slovakiajust prior to the Soviet crackdown of 1968, Bardem has seen fanaticism up close: His uncle won a major directing award at Cannes onlyto bejailed by General Francisco Franco's forces as soon as he returned home. "I was raised [Catholic] by my grandmothe4" says Bar- dem. "Then, little by little, I started to make some ques- tions about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I realized I respect people's beliefs but I started to really freak out about the manipulation of peo- ple's beliefs in order to gather fear. ... we have different [beliefs] but in the end it's the same, no?" Originally, Bardem was to play Goya, a figure who looms over Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as Forman and Jean-Claude Carri- ere wrote the script, and Brother Lorenzo became the cen-tral characte4, Bardem was asked to switch parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, he has already spent a lot of time with Goya, thanks to winning four Goyas, the Spanish equivalent of the Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, it hasn't gone to his head. "The Goya is a beautiful award," says Bardem. "It's Goya's head done in bronze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a look, a furious look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a head, but it has fury in it." I</p>
