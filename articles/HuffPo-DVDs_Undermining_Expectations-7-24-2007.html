Because it was overshadowed by thecultish sensation Fight Club , a 1999 film that reveled in more surprises and a career best performance from Brad Pitt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just when his talents seemed to be deepening,Fincher turned around and delivered thebland, woman-in-distress flick Panic Room in 2002, a movie that managed to make JodieFoster boring to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you might haveexpected a popcorn flick from Fincher ormaybe he'd just become a gun for hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Fincher's next project was Zodiac -- yet another stab at serial killers -- it seemed clear he had run out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who went to the film (and there weren't many) probably expectedfrights and grotesqueries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fincher did stage some early killings with discrete aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viewers soonfound themselves wrapped up in a movie delivered with the panache, substance and intelligence ofthe best 70s movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zodiac isn't The Silence of the Lambs, which is what we expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's All The President's Men .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story revolves around the terrible unsolved crimes of the Zodiac killer in the San Franciscoarea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Knowing in advance that the killer was never officially identified, how can Fincher hold ourattention for a meaty two hours and 37 minutes? He does it by focusing on the people caught up inthe drama, the cops (Mark Ruffalo), journalists (Robert Downey Jr.) and bystanders (illustratorJake Gyllenhaal) who can become obsessed with a case like Zodiac, who find it taking over theirlives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(Their three films - headed by the cotton candy perfection of 1959's Pillow Talk - have been packaged together in a more lavish set called "The Romance Collection." This one is for fans who just want the films and no frills.) Some might expect kitsch.Other might look forward to the frisson of sexual politics complicated by our knowledge that RockHudson was gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those expectations will be up-ended by the realization of how delightful the films are, how little they need a modern sensibility to create retro-fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudson -- even more than in his finemelodramatic work for Douglas Sirk -- is in his element here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Day? Her talent is simplyeffortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gossip columnist Liz Smith has been campaigning for Day to get an honorary Oscar foryears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One look at these films (not to mention her dramatic chops and decades-long career as aterrific singer) and you'll agree it's a crime she hasn't been given one already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, monster movie The Host ($29.98; Magnolia) up-ends expectations simply by being so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely a movie that sounds this fun -- a giant lizard-y sort of creature goes trammeling through South Korea -- couldn't actually be that fun? But it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a great beast, shadowygovernment conspiracies to explain its appearance, comic relief, a family united in their desire torescue a little girl trapped in the creature's lair...and did I mention that a giant lizard goesstomping all over the place? Scary, funny and gripping, this is what drive-ins were made for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: the overseas smash hit drama Perfume ($29.99; Paramount), with stage actor Ben Whishaw showing notable promise on film; The Ultimate Underdog Collection Vol. 1 ($1295; Classic Media), just in time to cash in on the woeful-looking feature film version; and Jean-Pierre Melville's Les Enfants Terribles ($39.95; Criterion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Liam Neeson Speaks Secrets Behind Making 'Taken' How He Feels About His Family Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...
