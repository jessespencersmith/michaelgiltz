"And I'm sure 'Access' wouldn't have let me out of my contract if they had known" that "ET" was interested, laughs O'Dell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's sort of the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone in the TV business believed the job was taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last August, when Hart announced she was leaving "ET" after nearly 30 years, itwas widely believed Spencer would get the top job. "ET" executive producer Linda Bell Blue had reportedly coaxedSpencer to move her family to LA with the promise of eventually replacing Hart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, according to an industry insider, the decision to go with O'Dell was CBSboss Les Moonves' (his network owns "ET"), who apparently believed O'Dell was the best way to maintain warm tiesto celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Dell says she anticipated none of this when she walked away from "Access."

"I think after you reach a certain level of maturity and a certain point in your career and you know what you want and what you feel goodabout, you know when it's time to make a change. " 'ET' is the gold standard," she says. "Celebrities trust it and they know what they're going to get when they go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, audiences like it too." Her first day on the job at "ET" -- where she is a correspondent until next May -- "felt weirdly like home," says O'Dell. "The people feel right, the executives feel right, the fellow correspondents feel right, the way the show is -- the classiness -- feels right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was such a great confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, I felt I made the right decision." As O'Dell jokes, the switch isn't that jarring."Everybody already thought I worked at 'Entertainment Tonight' anyway," she says. "It was frustrating when I worked at 'Access' . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would walk through an airport and people would say, 'Nancy O'Dell! Da-da-da-da-da-da!' They'd sing the 'Entertainment Tonight' theme song!" Like Sign Up to see what your friends like. 11 More PrintNYPOST Comments (3) Eileen P 12/30/2010 2:28 AM Love...love...love Nancy!!!
