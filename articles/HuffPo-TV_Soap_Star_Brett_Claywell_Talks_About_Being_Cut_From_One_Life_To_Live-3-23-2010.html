Kudos to the actors, read his interview applaud his comments about standing up and being advocates for those who don't have a voice... i'm straight, but it's as if gay peole don't exist in daytime for the most part, so i really felt this was such a lovely couple, oh well, Virginia, i guess there is no Santa Claus... nice,real nice... it's a shame that OLTL did not want to continue this story. even more of a shame that they couldn't write out a better exit for kyle and oliver. hope the two actors move on to successful careers though after this. 1 of 5 Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, Efficiency Steve Ballmer My Keynote Address at the 2011 International Consumer Electronics ShowDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Paltrow Dishes on Cruise 1 of 9 camille grammer jennifer connelly baby bump natalie portman raven symone weight loss rebecca budig Recency | Popularity jessicajuliette 12:33 AM on 3/24/2010 Permalink | Share it entemplin 08:06 PM on 3/23/2010 Permalink | Share itFall More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.comComments are closed for this entry View All Like 6K John Edwards Is Not Engaged, Says Source READ MORE Is Jane KrakowskiPregnant?
