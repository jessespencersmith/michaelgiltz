                <p>S U N D A Y , A P R I L 1 7 , 2 0 0 5Michael Schiavo's Good Name Cleared? No OnePays Attentionby Michael in New York on 4/17/2005 12:56:00 PMWhen my computer was down, I didn't get to weigh in on a lotof issues, but one drove me the craziest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last days ofTerri Schiavo, I didn't see ANY balanced reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every leadstory on TV, every lead article in the paper was a variation on"Terri Schiavo's parents continue to fight to keep their daughteralive" or "Terri Schiavo's parents fail in their latest attempt tofight for their daughter." CNN Headline News was reduced toairing the years-old doctored footage of Terri edited to misleadpeople and backed with New Age guitar music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There wasn'tONE story I saw -- and I started looking obsessively -- thatbegan "Michael Schiavo continues to fight to fulfill his dyingwife's wishes" or "Michael Schiavo continues the fight to let hiswife die with dignity." Drove me bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Couldn't one newsoutlet at least have pretended to do balanced coverage?So now that the MSM has moved on, we get a quiet news itemon A-7 of The Washington Post that, by the way, all thosebaseless absurd charges against Michael Schiavo about abusinghis wife were absolutely without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Per the WashingtonPost:In the four years after Michael Schiavo won the right toremove his wife's feeding tube, the state's social welfareagency investigated 89 complaints of abuse but neverfound that he or anybody else harmed Terri Schiavo,records released late Friday show.The state Department of Children and Familiesrepeatedly concluded that Michael Schiavo ensured hiswife's physical and medical needs were met, providedproper therapy for her and had no control over hermoney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also found no evidence that he beat orstrangled her, as his detractors have repeatedlycharged.The 45 pages of confidential abuse reports madepublic by court order show that despite the litany ofcomplaints, investigators never found that TerriSchiavo had been abused.The records show that DCF took seriously its duty toinvestigate abuse allegations, which became familiarfodder on the Internet: Terri Schiavo was dirty andunkempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She did not receive proper dental care orrehabilitative therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was kept in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Herhusband beat her and broke her bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wanted herdead for her money or to remarry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He pumped her fullof insulin, hoping to kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He often asked, "Whenwill (she) die?" Her lips were cracked and dry.But DCF investigators looked into the charges andclosed them as unfounded with such comments as"the spouse has always been courteous and verycompassionate toward his wife" and "all her needsbeing met."Michael Schiavo got poor press for a number of reasons: he tried tokeep his wife's plight from being turned into a media circus, he didn't HuffPost PoliticsJames Crowley, Policeman Who Arrested Gates,Won't Apologize - NATICK, Mass. — A white policesergeant accused of racism after he arrestedrenowned black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. at hishome insisted Wednesday...4 minutes ago Daily KosIOKIYAPI (It's OK If You're A Private Insurer) -Here's William Kristol revealing the *horrors*hidden within the health care bill as it emergedfrom the HELP committee...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Kennedy and hisco-autho...13 minutes ago Ben SmithObama: Cambridge police acted 'stupidly' - Afterspending most of an hour patiently reiterating hisarguments for changing the health insurancesystem, President Barack Obama turned his press56 minutes ago Crooks and LiarsGlenn Beck Defends His Radio Show Freakout: ItWas Just Common Sense - You can view this videoright here by getting the latest version of FlashPlayer!
