                <p>More Create Blog Sign In WEDNESDAY, MAY 01, 2019 THEATER: "BEETLEJUICE" SHOWS A LITTLE LIFE BEETLEJUICE ** out of **** WINTER GARDEN THEATRE The new show Beetlejuice just scored eight Tony nominations, including Best Musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its best bet to win a statue is surely in Best Scenic Design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nominee David Korins gets to play in the world createdby the film's director Tim Burton and he in turn was inspired by Edward Gorey, old horror films and a thousand other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Korins has a blast in this show, creating a nicely askew old home and then layering on look after look for the main set right in front of our eyes.Combine that with ghouls, a giant snake (I mean, a GIANT snake),wacky costumes by William Ivey Long (also nominated) and great lighting by Kenneth Posner and Peter Nigrini (both also nominated) and sound by Peter Hylenski (ditto, or is that thritto?) and you've gota fun show with a pop-up haunted house aesthetic that fans of TimBurton will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in Alex Brightman's tireless cheerleading asthe title ghoul (essentially delivering the same Red Bull of a performance he delivered in School Of Rock even though it's supposed to be subversive rather than inspiring) and you've got a show that's not bad, a backhanded compliment but a sincere one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turning the movie Beetlejuice into a musical made more sense than, say, Pretty Woman for the simple fact that everyone who saw it remembers the big musical number and funniest moment in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the scene where people at a dinner party are unwittingly forcedby a demon to lip sync to Harry Belafonte's "Day-O (The Banana BoatSong)." On stage, the actors actually sing the song, though I think it would have been funnier to have them lip sync, just like in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still the highlight of the stage show, just like in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there'sthe problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the fun bits of Beetlejuice (just like most of the fun bits in Tootsie ) feel like call backs to what was done better and first onMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–¼ 2019 (31) â–º June (1) â–¼ May (9)film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, unlike Tootsie the movie Beetlejuice is a modest comedy at best, so there's not much to mine in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show's creators knew that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film is a collection of gags sort of held together by Michael Keaton's manic turn and the achingseriousness of Winona Ryder (which makes her intentionally all the funnier).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's almost no plot worth mentioning or caring about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the show must engineer one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our teen goth heroine (a solid Sophia Anne Caruso) isn't just a kidwho LOVES to embrace the weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of choosing to be goth, she is burdened by the death of her mom, which is a lot less fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her dadadds to the pain by refusing to mention his dead wife's name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takesa haunted house, two very dull ghosts, the sexy beast Beetlejuice, afake guru, that giant snake and a trip to the underworld (or the Nether Region or whatever they call it) just to get dad to admit he misses his wife too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a big journey for a very small and obvious payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the show collapses under our lack of interest in the blandghosts (poor Kerry Butler and Rob McClure, doing their best), theforgettable songs and the heartfelt confessions of a girl and her dad we could see coming a mile off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beetlejuice is a lot more fun when it just goes nuts, from the crazy costumes to the chorus of ghouls to Brightman getting all sexually fluid with every character in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first act really is pretty good, almost, thanks to Brightman, a lot of sight gags and Leslie Kritzer doing a great turn as the ditzy Delia (played in the film by Catherine O'Hara).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really, it was Tony-worthy but fell through the cracks in a strong yearfor supporting women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We barely cared about the characters in act one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When act two keepsintroducing more of them to less and less interest (a bland fakeguru/exorcist; an underworld bureaucrat, etc.) along with thatthoroughly unnecessary heartwarming revelation, the show's energyflags entirely.
