If they ever explained how she came to12/16/2015Theater: 'Absolute Brightness' Great Actor, So-So Script | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=35732f33-f687-48e8-be78-fd962bc9e66b&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4shelter Leonard, I missed it.Further, we're told repeatedly how Leonard has changed everyone around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I certainly didn't want an Anne-of-Green-Gables series of episodes where we hear how Leonard solved this problem or brought that coupletogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's enough for a kid to be themselves, a proud role model for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, if you're going to insisthe changed everyone's lives for the better, it would be nice to argue exactly how. (Only the old watch makeroffers a good if passive example; out of fear he tried to force his own gay son to "change" and Leonard is achance for him to see gay kids could be loved.)Finally, it's little surprise who killed Leonard or why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So some false drama is inserted by Lecesne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leonard'sAunt Ellen -- that brassy hair dresser that speaks her mind and everyone claims bulldozes her way through life?-- suddenly, out of nowhere this force of nature decides she WON'T speak at the trial when the family of victimsis allowed to voice their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really? You couldn't shut her up and now for no good reason and againsteverything we know about her this tiger woman is staying meekly quiet? So the suspense about whether she'llactually speak out is somewhat less than nil.The story is set in 2005, so we can more easily accept that the bullying (and worse) Leonard faces wouldn'traise so many red flags or have the adults in his life raising hell at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course bullying exists todayand always will for kids who are different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a way, it's a pleasure to report how stereotypical, sounremarkable Absolute Brightness seems to us now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out gay teen? Bullying? These are still flashpoints, but atleast their stories don't seem hard to believe or utterly unreal anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's progress.Director Tony Speciale oversees the work with a fine eye, helping Lecesne to craft some vivid moments thanksto the lighting of Matt Richards and especially the effective but unobtrusive sound design of ChristianFrederickson. (Frederickson has fun at one moment with a squeaky door but it's an earned one.) Duncan Sheikoffers some modest original music that keeps the sad nature of what's being investigated front and center evenas the parade of characters amuse and entertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lecesne the actor of course is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lets himself downwith the script but one never questions that his heart is in the right place and on full display every night.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2 Parade in Concert at Lincoln Center ** 1/2 Hamilton at the Public *** The World Of Extreme Happiness ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year 1915-1940 ** Verite * 1/2 Fabulous! * The Mystery Of Love &amp; Sex ** An Octoroon at Polonsky Shakespeare Center *** 1/2 Fish In The Dark * The Audience *** Josephine And I *** Posterity * 1/2 The Hunchback Of Notre Dame **</p>
