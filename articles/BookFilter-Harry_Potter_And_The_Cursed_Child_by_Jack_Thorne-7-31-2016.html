Read on for a little more depth though I'll only touch on the very general outline of the plot, which most anyone will be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was indeed fun to dive back into the world of Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's 30 years on and this "special rehearsal edition" ofthe new play by Jack Thorne (based on a new story by he, John Tiffany and JK Rowling) begins right where the final bookended: with Harry Potter a proud(?) parent, seeing off his youngest son Albus as the lad returns to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plotline most have heard about -- young Albus is burdened by being in the shadow of his famous dad and Harry is a rather awkward father -- seemed promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It offered the possibility of a new spin on the magical boarding school Hogwarts (it's not fun foreveryone, you know) and Albus befriending Scorpius (the son of Draco) felt just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the main inspirationhere seems to have been the movie "Back To The Future II," with the new storyline revolving around the old storyline wealready know in far too labored a fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus the dialogue of Thorne is heavy-handed, with character after character spelling out their feelings in baldly declamatory style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before we can psychoanalyze any comment, the characters are doing it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, I couldn't quite resist the pull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For all its faults (and they are many), the promise of seeing itbrought to life onstage is still tantalizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story certainly doesn't take the easy way out in terms of staging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There aremany, many characters; many scene changes; many dramatic special effects and a spooky sense that they'll be making full use of the theatrical space (and an excellent sound mix) to immerse the audience in the magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish they'd stuck with the simpler, human premise of focusing on the son of Harry Potter and not felt compelled to get the band back together as theysay (virtually every beloved character makes an appearance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish we actually SAW Albus stumble through school and seema "loser" rather than just passingly hear about it before the main action begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, "Cursed Child" remains true toRowling and her desire to grow more and more serious in plot and the consequences of plot as the books developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To its credit, our idea of exactly WHO the cursed child might be changes throughout the four act drama and could be argued over long after the curtain has fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, not a keeper but not a blemish exactly and with the right stagecraft it's probably a lotmore fun to see in person than read on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like most plays. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Praise for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts I and II * “Series fans can breathe easy knowing this play has been respectfully and lovingly wrought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tensions thrum, spells fly… but at center stage, as always in the Potterverse, is the overriding importance of love and friendship,especially in the face of danger.” -- Booklist , starred review - What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
