I've only seen the regular DVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do yourself and yourfamily a favor and rent or buy it immediately.There's no better way to celebrate the moon landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like a lot of great documentaries, For All Mankind breaks a lot of rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filmmaker Al Reinert (who went on to co-write Ron Howard's best film, Apollo 13 ) decided to treat all the Apollo missions as essentially one event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His film depicts an idealized journey from the earth to the moon, grabbing footage wherever he found it and even letting the voice of one astronaut describe hisemotions while we are watching somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? As explained in a very good making-of documentary, Reinert realized that the best launch footage might come from one mission, the best space walk from another (not even an Apollo mission, actually), the best shots inside the capsulefrom another, the best view of a stage of the rocket breaking off from another and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So he just mixed and matched and created the best story he could, without worrying that footage from Apollo 9 might jump to footage from Apollo 4 and be followed by Apollo 13 and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this matters when you watch the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's simply a gorgeous, nerve-wracking experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your first response is awe; the second response is "Why haven't we ever seen thisfootage before?" The views of the rocket igniting and launching into space are overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hailey Glassman Gushes over Jon Gosselin READ MORE Demi Lovato and Trace Cyrus Split READ MORE Katherine Heigl's First Day Back at Grey's Was 'Cruel andMean' READ MORE More Celebrity News at People.com Popular Stories on HuffPost Nude In NY: Where To Strut With No Stuff (NSFWPHOTOS, POLL) Believe it or not getting nude in NY isn't such a hard feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATE: 'Sprite OralSex Ad' WasUnauthorized (VIDEO) UPDATE 5:OO PM ET The director of the fake Sprite ad, Max Issacson, has sent...BIG NEWS : Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 | Sports | Farrah Fawcett | Celebrity Kids | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Stephen Baldwin Files For Bankruptcy Hailey Glassman: Jon Gosselin Is A 'Great Cook,' Parents 'Love Him' PHOTOS: Hollywood's Hottest Older Men: Better With Age? (POLL) Michael Giltz: DVDs -- Celebrate Moon Landing With Little Known Classic For All Mankind http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----celebrate-moon-la_b_241371.html [7/21/2009 5:16:25 PM]massive explosions, the roiling flames, and the noise help you realize that they don't launch or glide or soar into space -- they explode into space and being the guys perched on top of that roman candle has never seemed nuttier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When an astronaut goes for a space walk, it also seems terrifyingly scary...until you're overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of what they're seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then theastronauts are on the moon, rolling around in a car and hopping about while giggling like little kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who can blame them? But the images are so sharp, so clear and striking it takes your breath away and you feel jealous all over again for what they got to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All these years, the supplemental footage tells us, we've been watching grainy copies of copies of the same two or three moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The footage on display in For All Mankind was simply never seen before, often even by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey came out a year before the moon landing and that film is still revelatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes you might have to remind yourself that this footage is REAL and it's really happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's how inured to space missions we've become by both the lack of anything beyond the space station (which dulls our realization of how dangerous traveling beyond the Earth can be) and the constant images of it we see in movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But few movies real or fictional are as gorgeous to behold as this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine any science teacher who wouldn't want to show this film to their class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine any kid who would watch this and not spend at least the next few days saying they want tobe an astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine any adult not seeing it and appreciating anew the beauty of Earth and the foolhardy, wonderful recklessness of what was accomplished 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For All Mankind is a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Recent Criterion Releases As I've said before, you can never go wrong purchasing any film released by Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're always substantial films produced with loving care and extras that set the industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every special edition DVD put out by any other studio is just imitating what Criterion pioneered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'vealso been smarter than major studios by pricing BluRays the same as their regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On saleat Amazon, they're increasingly priced even less since sometimes the extras that need to be on a second regular DVD can fit comfortably onto the much roomier BluRay version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some recent titles of theirs now available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always try to talk about DVDs within a week or two of theirrelease but Criterion titles are timeless so you can talk about them anytime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last Year at Marienbad ($39.95 for regular or BluRay from Criterion but the regular on sale at Amazon is $34.99 and the BluRay is only $19.99) -- OK, I'm not a fan of director Alain Resnais but he's a director you simply have to deal with if you're any sort of film buff and the enigmatic puzzle that is Last Year At Marienbad is the principal reason why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This 1961 New Wave landmark virtually defined one half of the twin poles of foreign films for American audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the onehand you had the earthy humor of Fellini and the tantalizing promise of sensuality (foreign films always promised more skin than they delivered but boy were they sophisticated about sex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, you had the high art pretensions of Godard and Resnais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiences delighted in tryingto "figure out" this movie in which guests at a famed exclusive resort may or may not have met there the year before and may or may not have had an affair or be having an affair right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a lot more fun if you don't try to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've compared both the regular DVD and theBluRay and both look gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are loaded with extras, including a new audio interview withResnais himself, who is still producing inexplicable but playful films even today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My Dinner with Andre ($39.95; Criterion) -- It never seemed that audacious to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A movie about two guys having dinner -- literally a movie in which one guy gets in a cab, arrives and spends almost two hours talking with his friend? Why not? When the two guys are Wallace Shawn andAndre Gregory, it makes even more sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gregory spins tale after tale during dinner, fantasticalevents from his life that quietly glide into fantasy (a faun? Did he say a faun?) and usually seem to end with everyone in the story drinking and dancing until dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Louis Malle captures it all effortlessly, though the effort in making two guys sitting at a table not become boring seemsdaunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But actually, it's not and those filmmakers who edit with a frenzy even the action-packedmotion of a concert or car chase should take note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, movies are FILLED with lengthy scenes in which two people simply talk: the centerpiece of the IRA film Hunger (which opened earlier this year) involves a lengthy talk between a priest and a prisoner) or the opener of Quentin Tarantino's upcoming Inglorious Basterds in which a farmer talks with a Nazi in his farmhouse for about 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are thoroughly gripping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so is My Dinner With Andre which still seems toflummox people with its premise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember my brother's incredulity when I suggested we watchit years ago. "Two guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's it?" Half the fun of his watching it was knowing he could go back to his friends the next day and tell them the nutty film I got him to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then, out of nowhere, he became caught up in what they were saying and forgot how ridiculous it was They Played Presidents: Who Was Believable?

"For All Mankind" is the definitive documentary, in my opinion about the space program! BTW, last night Turner Classic Movies aired "The Right Stuff" in honor of the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a Hollywood depiction of the early days of the space race, nothing can top "The Right Stuff"--great script and one of the best ensemble casts EVER! mgorbet I'm a Fan of mgorbet permalink For All Mankind is also available for free on-demand on http://www.theauteurs.com http://www.theauteurs.com/films/599 (The Auteurs also has tons of other fantastic classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worth checking out) I watched it a few weeks ago and had the same reaction -- why don't more people know about this film? Tallulah Morehead - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Tallulah Morehead permalink One doesn't need to buy FOR ALL MANKIND.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's on TCM today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had alreadyset my DVR to record it before reading this very interesting review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have attempted to watch MY DINNER WITH ANDRE on three different occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On each of them, I have seen 10 to 20 minutes of it, and then found myself waking up, with the film long over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not making a joke here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has literally put me tosleep, deep sleep, on three separate viewing attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I keep hearing from intelligent, discriminatingcritics like yourself that it is fascinating, and each time it has proved to be the most effective sleep-inducing drug I've ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alfred Hitchcock, in his book-length conversation with Truffaut, spoke of trying to make MOVIES, not "pictures of people talking." MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is the ultimate "picture of people talking," andregardless of how riveting I am repeatedly told their conversation is, I have found it over and over to beas soporific as Hitchcock warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Well, at least you've found a great tranquilizer for the nights when youhave insomnia :) I've sometimes not "gotten" a movie or book thatothers love and have been willing to give it two or three shots (after adecent interval has passed to let my disinterest/hatred subside).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Likeany discerning person, you gave an acclaimed film more than a fair shake. (I, for example, dislike most of Godard despite several tries on numerous films.) Andnow you never have to watch My Dinner With Andre again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless, of course, you're havingtrouble falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for mentioning the TCM airing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I forgot to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tallulah Morehead - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Tallulah Morehead permalink Understand, I'm not saying MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is abad or a boring movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't, because I haven't seen mostof it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has truely just rendered me unconscious everytimeI've attempted to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have heard many times that it'sgreat from people whose opinions I respect, but it drops me in my tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tallulah Morehead - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Tallulah Morehead permalink I should add that I've had the reverse experience withJacques Tati films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love his four Hulot films, but on acouple occasions I have run one or another of them forfriends, only to have them left utterly cold and bored by him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:38 PM on 07/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:01 PM on 07/20/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:14 PM on 07/20/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:33 AM on 07/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:21 AM on 07/21/2009Michael Giltz: DVDs -- Celebrate Moon Landing With Little Known Classic For All Mankind http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----celebrate-moon-la_b_241371.html [7/21/2009 5:16:25 PM]Morehead's Profile SarahPalin.Google.com/LoveHateComedy hardly gets more exquisite than Tati (and bless Criterion for their lovely releases of these films), but they sure bore the hell out of some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Sarah Palin? 1 - Minute Poll Do You Support Sarah Palin?
