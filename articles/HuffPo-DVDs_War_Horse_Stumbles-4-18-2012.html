But do something other than generally ignore what made Thatcher as interesting and compelling as any Shakespearean king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead,people who don't know their history would look at this story of a nice little old lady and wonder whypeople on the street are screaming at her and bombing the places where she stays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toothless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Cameron Crowe is utterly lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least Elizaebthtown flopped with originality and a sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We Bought A Zoo is just an anonymous, family friendly film that might have been (mis)directed by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone help this man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOP Approves Abortion Ban Slash Caught Fellow Rocker Naked With His Mom The Most Awkward Wedding Photobombs DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 6 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2Recommend 9k Like 247 Like 1k Ann's Love For Mitt, Jon Voight on Jolie-Pitt Kids and Politics Where Are They Now?

Why We Aren't Playing at the RNC David Lean Directs Noel Coward ($79.95; Criterion) -- Another impeccable boxed set from Criterion, this one celebrating the collaboration between a young David Lean and writer/actor Noel Coward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before Lean turned into a specialist in smart epics like Lawrence Of Arabia, he was a tight, economical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His first truly exceptional movie was Great Expectations, but you can see him building to that masterpiece in these four earlier films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blithe Spirit is based on a stage smash about a husband haunted by the ghost of his first wife while trying to get along with his second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a play, it must have seemed awfully clever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Coward's essential disinterest in humanity shines through in this silly froth: any writer worth his salt would have grounded the comedy in some sort of purpose, such as having the ghost helping the husband set aside his first love and commit wholly to the new wife or dumping a harridan that was no good for him or... well...something! This comedy just bounces about to no purpose and without nearly enough humor to let it coast on charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Happy Breed is a lower class spin on Coward's Oscar-winning Cavalcade .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both tell the recent history of Great Britain through the eyes of a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Happy Breed is solid agit prop to gin up soldiers by reminding everyone of exactly what England was fighting for (hearth and home and all that mush).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miniver but interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brief Encounter is the best of the bunch, a terribly stiff upper lip drama in which the romance is painfully, beautifully unsatisfied in the most Britishof manners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After seeing numerous Coward plays, hearing many of his songs and watching these movies,I must admit he leaves me cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gilbert &amp; Sullivan are sillier, Oscar Wilde and Shaw more pointed, whileCoward is just archness and "sophistication." But Coward certainly couldn't ask for a better presentationof his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Criterion includes bountiful extras, from a UK TV show about Coward's career to a 1971documentary about Lean and even a rare audio chat from 1969 between Richard Attenborough andCoward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly, Coward was at his best in small talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roger Corman's Cult Classics: The Nurses Collection ($19.93; Shout) -- In this feminine critique of gender roles and the medical society's historic tendency to marginalize, ignore or dismiss aspsychological the physical ailments of women, the white uniforms of the nurses represent not purity andinnocence but its opposite, the blank slate of desire on which.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Okay, just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is more RogerCorman B movie silliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If titles like Candy Stripe Nurses , Night Call Nurses , Private Duty Nurses, and The Young Nurses sound like they're up your alley, by all means dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be prepared for less nudity and naughtiness than you're hoping for but hey -- in the early 1970s there was no Skinemax, so what elsedid you have to watch?HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Elections 2012 Ron Paul Social Media Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan Oasis 2012 Net Neutrality Anatomical Wonders MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin ricky_martin RetweetMake Room for (the New) Daddy http://t.co/Q6eIDokm via @huffingtonpost feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, many others including octopi, havehuman-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQhThe Conquest ($29.95; Music Box) Sleeping Beauty ($24.98; MPI) Miss Bala ($29.99; Fox) -- The Conquest is a fun, smart political drama about Nicolas Sarkozy's unlikely rise to power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I boned up on French politics to prepare myself for this movie but the performances aresharp enough and the lust for power universal enough to translate into any language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sleeping Beauty is a rather silly tale of a young woman's almost passive descent into the sort of kinky netherworld that onlyexists in movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the lead Emily Browning is totally committed to her part and director Julia Leigh is so completely in control of the story on a technical level that you just know they both have real talent and are ones to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miss Bala never quite lives up to its catchy premise -- beauty queen wannabe gets caught up in drug wars -- but is a serviceable thriller nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I expect a U.S. remakewith a comic spin.FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...

pagewanted=all 09:03 AM on 04/19/2012 I thought War Horse was worth the watch. 03:40 AM on 04/19/2012 This is a good analysis, if not in argument at least in intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Articles that ask "Is it worth the money?" are extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In my personal opinion, it takes quite a bit to warrant buying a film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seemsfrivolous to own lots of movies that just sit on the shelf collecting dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Putting up the prices of these films is a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Spielberg, he seems to be a bit past his prime when it comes to making films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; War Horse does not look like a terrible film, but it fits into the standard niche of the inspirational film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With howtired the genre is, expectations for these types of films are exceptionally low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People have seenwhat happens when Spielberg makes a truly inspirational film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; War Horse looks very saccharine;Spielberg needs to step it up if he wants silver screen glory again. http://www.videodetective.com/movies/schindlers-list/5037 07:34 PM on 04/18/2012 I will admit I have not seen "War Horse." But I do have a strong opinion of the directorial career of Mr Spielberg.As Mr Giltz points out, Stephen Speilberg's career as a major director has had his ups and downs.sureofit Permalink | Share it rp2par Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Wistfulslinking World traveller, bon-vivant, writer..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it rich3324 Likes: Chasing villagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dislikes: Fire Permalink | Share it ScottHarrigan Permalink | Share it FirstGame72 The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters2 Fans 236 Fans 702 Fans 696 Fans 2 Fans 564 FansThis user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program Although he is easily one of the top 3 or 4 best American directors of the last 40 years, he spent most of the 1980's - while American film as a whole was enjoying one if it's finest decades - tryingto get in the "zone," as they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After ET (1982) Stephen struggled to find his "vision" and he didnot turn it around again until Jurassic Park (1993).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there is plenty of precedent for a misstep now with "War Horse." I do disagree with Mr Giltz dismissal of Mr Speilberg's films of the last decade and feel this may have even hurt his argument against War Horse (which i might like when i see it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last ten year's (since catch me if you can) I feel that both "War of the Worlds" and "Munich"are both excellent films - right on par with Mr Speilberg's finest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I feel that both were dismissed bycritics for more politcal reasons than artistic ones which lead to both of them being somewhat ignored by the public. 01:20 PM on 04/19/2012 Thanks for commenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure what any political objections would be to War Of The Worlds. it had some great tense moments but like the novel and previous film versions, itjust peters out at the end in a rather deflating manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Munich, it's the mostnoteworthy of his films from the past decade but still didn't make my best of the year list, unlike so many other Spielberg films of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's my standard for him; I expect a great film and when it's merely good or okay, I consider it a disappointment. 01:58 PM on 04/19/2012 War Horse was fantastic and universally lauded...by the academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Six nominations including one for Best Picture speaks volumes ;) 02:12 PM on 04/19/2012 Why tell me? I didn't give it a bad review, Mr Giltz did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I said I haven't seen it yet and I'm reserving judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However I do recall a review of the film on Salonwhere they panned it pretty badly so acclaim was not "universal." But is it ever in the art world? 03:13 PM on 04/19/2012 War Horse was reviewed favourably by 77% of "Top Critics" aggregated on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nowhere does that amount to being "universally lauded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All 06:32 PM on 04/18/2012 Regarding War Horse, the finale scene of orange/red colors was in fact real and was filmed by Speilberg in a spontaneous reaction to an actual epic sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some parts of the film were cliche andsimple, but it was geared more as a family film than the live theater versions.Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Wistfulslinking World traveller, bon-vivant, writer..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; History | Permalink | Share it FirstGame72 The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters Permalink | Share it agness nutter What fresh hell is this?

Please! It's a fine family film and while it comes up far short against The Black Stallion it is an excellent companion to that film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have a family and are looking for a film that you can all watch together, 8 and up for the kidsdue to the non-bloody war scenes, then War Horse is worth bringing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glitz' criticism is outrageously over the top.He's a bit more on point regarding Iron Lady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Streep is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The script is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We Bought A Zoo IS a disappointment from Cameron Crowe but again it's a perfectly acceptablefamily rental.Treme like The Wire before it is outstanding TV.Watching on DVD is the best way to see it.But it's HBO and not for the kids. 01:29 PM on 04/19/2012 HI NHBIll, thanks for commenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My standard of criticism is not "can this film be watchedwith your children without fear of adult content?" It's simply, is this a good film or not?Many films qualify as family fare, even painless family fare, but still aren't good films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lorax is a fine family film if you want something safe, and as a parent I might get dragooned into watching it, just as my nieces and nephews suddenly had me seeing Alvinand the Chipmunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrible, terrible movie (and far worse than the bland War Horse) butwas it ok family fare? Yes, in the sense of is it appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes in the sense will adultssometime allow subpar fare be put on thier DVD players to keep the kids amused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, inthe sense of is it an enduring work of art, which the best family films can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll take The Black Stallion a hundred times over rather than War Horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll take Toy Story over The Lorax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same with We Bought A Zoo. we both seem to agree it's not good; why show yourkids a so-so movie? Why not rent a classic instead? I agree 100% that shows like Tremeare best watched all at once in a marathon over a week or two rather than stretched out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itdoes improve the experience. 02:14 PM on 04/19/2012 I was motivated to comment by your hyperbolic criticism of "War Horse" as"Shameless, terrible work."("Human Centipede 2" or "Hostel 2" is "Shameless, terrible work.") "War Horse" was nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture! The biggest thing the film is guilty of is overt manipulation but as with all Spielbergfilms it is expertly crafted with fine performances from the cast.Many critics seem to take umbrage at John Williams' Oscar nominated score forWar Horse.I'm not one of them.War Horse is "B" level Spielberg which in my view makes for worthwhile family home viewing that eases children into the mature theme of the futility of war.HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it NHBill Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it NHBill Permalink | Share it127 Fans 673 Fans 127 Fans 673 FansAdvertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost Entertainment</p>
