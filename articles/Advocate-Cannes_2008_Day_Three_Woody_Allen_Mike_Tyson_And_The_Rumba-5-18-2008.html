                <p>May 18, 2008Cannes Day Three -- Woody Allen, MikeTyson and the RumbaNo, sadly, Woody Allen and Mike Tyson did not do the rumbaon the red carpet at Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a day pretty lacking in queercontent, about the best I can offer is old footage of Mike Tysonberating a heckler at a press conference back in his boxing glorydays and ironically calling the man a faggot while insistingTyson will f--- him in the ass in front of everybody.Un Conte de Noel/A Christmas Tale -- The day began with "AChristmas Tale," an extremely French drama about a family (tocall it "dysfunctional" would be redundant, no?) that gatherstogether for the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two and a half hours long andfeaturing Mathieu Amalric of "The Diving Bell and theButterfly" and the beautiful, enigmatic Catherine Deneuve,about the most amusement one gets from it is the casual way allthe characters treat affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very familiar story of long-heldresentment, secrets and so on, enlivened somewhat by anexcellent cast.It's Hard Being Loved By Jerks -- The Trial -- A Frenchdocumentary shot while the editors of a French satiricalmagazine were on trial for re-publishing the Danish cartoonsthat poked fun/mocked/defamed Islam and the prophetMuhammed (take your pick) and after much prodding andexaggeration and lies (including the widespread disseminationof cartoons that were NOT created by the Danish cartoonistsand which were intentionally created to shock and angerMuslims since the genuine cartoons had sparked no widespreadoutrage in the Muslim world) ultimately engendered angrydemonstations and murders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film isstrictly talking heads, but the heads talking are voluble andentertaining and the subject itself is fascinating (yes, they doshow both the genuine cartoons and the false ones).Rumba -- One of the movies I've most anticipated at Cannes.Visit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement CategoriesBingham Cup 2008BooksCannes 2008Cannes Film FestivalCelebsCoachellaComic-Con 2007Current AffairsFashionFilmIs a man capable of being faithful to onewoman?

That alone is a relief for a director who hasmade so many weak, uninteresting or just plain awful moviessince 1992's terrific "Husbands and Wives" that you couldactually see his once towering reputation get lowered with eachnew release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this romantic comedy that gains a littleemotional heft towards the end, two young American women --Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall -- head to Barcelona forFilm FestivalsFood and DrinkIowa Caucus 2008LesbianMusicOutfest 2008PartiesPoliticsProvincetown Film Festival 2008Queen Mary 2 Historic CrossingReligionScienceSexSportsSydney Mardi Gras 2008Taylor Hanson for The AdvocateTelevisionThe DinahThe HRC Logo ForumThe L WordTheaterTravelRecent PostsMTV Video Music Awards...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheap, Or What?Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles: 30 Years YoungEric McCormack Auctions Off Porsche for ProjectAngel FoodWhat is the Advocate Insider?

Polite applause?Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But frankly I expected director James Toback -- who has avimax on Awards Night: Miniskirts, Musicals, andMamaomar on Amman SegregatesArchivesSeptember 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008April 2008March 2008February 2008January 2008December 2007November 2007September 2008SunMonTueWedThuFriSat 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Subscribe to this blog's feedAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-day-thre.html 3 of 57/22/09 4:19 PMdistinguished career -- to get more applause from a bunch ofcineastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But fame apparently trumps all.Posted at 11:43 PM in Cannes 2008 | PermalinkTrackBackTrackBack URL for this entry:http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341ca4b653ef00e55234aebc8833Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Cannes Day Three --Woody Allen, Mike Tyson and the Rumba:CommentsOne of the other publications is conducting a poll on which song theypropose as an anthem for Pride 2008.It seems to me that the are being frivilioius in a time when there is aneed to focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been a long and winding road, the victories havebeen sweet and hard fought and further struggle lies ahead throughNovember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These may well be the "Best Days", but there are moreahead.More fitting then is Graham Colton's "Best Days" and I have made amusic video in that regard.Please let me know what you think.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG78RzXEOdo~GARi-~~Posted by: GShotsTV | June 04, 2008 at 05:42 AMVerify your CommentPreviewing your CommentPosted by: | This is only a preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your comment has not yet been posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post Edit Your comment could not be posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Error type:Your comment has been posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post another commentThe letters and numbers you entered did not match the image.Please try again.As a final step before posting your comment, enter the lettersand numbers you see in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This preventsautomated programs from posting comments.Having trouble reading this image?
