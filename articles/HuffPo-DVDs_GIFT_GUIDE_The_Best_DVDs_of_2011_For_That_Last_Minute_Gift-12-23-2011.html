(Hey, it didn't come OUT till that day!) CITIZEN KANE 70TH ANNIVERSARY ULTIMATE EDITION ($79.89; Warner Bros.) -- Obviously it's one of the most important films of all time. if you love movies, you probably (or should)own a copy already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, I HATE exclusives, where bonus stuff is only available if you go to this store orshop at this site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this one is a doozy and a real treat for movie lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if your giftee owns Kane , they certainly don't own a DVD of The Magnificent Ambersons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's never been out before and is only available via Amazon if you buy this lavish new set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a bonus disc! Ambersons is a champ as well and deserves its own lavish set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps they're waiting until they can find the missing reel with all thefootage cut out! Till then, no better treat can be had than to finally own Ambersons .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just saw it at Film Forum and boy is it a tremendous movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's reputation would be even higher if it wasn't seen so rarely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hey, a Film Forum membership is a great gift for any friend who lives in NYC!

(What? You already knew that?) I keep these handy movie guides right by my tv and consult them all the time whenworking on my columns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maltin is rock solid on the spellings of titles, actors, credits and the like and his team of reviewers can be counted on for judicious, mainstream opinions. (They're not quirky, so you know if they give a movie a solid rating that most others would too and it's worth DVRing and so on.) The Classic Movie Guide is great for those like me who are hardcore about our TCM watching or justwant something we can trust for a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't leave home without it was the Amex slogan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idon't go to the movies without these and barely a day goes by when I don't open them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BARNEY MILLER: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($159.99; Shout) -- Shout is another label you can put yourtrust in: if they've put out a DVD set, chances are it will be of the best possible quality and with all theextras you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had fond memories of Barney Miller but wasn't sure where it belongs in the pantheon.It has a tremendous cast of course and cops always named it the most realistic of police shows. (Really.Higher than Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue and you name it.) I've just started season four and while AbeVigoda, Linda Lavin and Gregory Sierra are sorely, sorely missed at this point, it's still a great ensemble.The extras are solid, the packaging compact and nice and the set as a whole impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fitting tributeto one of TV's finest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRIDESHEAD REVISITED 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($69.99 BluRay; Acorn) -- One of TV's greatest miniseries is finally given proper treatment and a new remastering so you can enjoy it onBluRay or DVD in all its glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeremy Irons made a tremendous splash with this look at a passing age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the third episode, the entire series is just loss, loss, loss right down to the bitter finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may not mourn the vanished world of the aristocracy (especially if you're not blue-blooded) but this work can surely make you feel like you should, if only for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAUREL &amp; HARDY: THE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION ($99.98; RHI) -- One of the greatest comedy teams of all time...wait, my friend Damien is now pointing a gun at my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let me rephrase that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GREATEST comedy team of all time, Laurel &amp; Hardy have been almost invisible for decades now, with their best work -- their shorts -- unavailable on DVD and rarely seen in any context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That has changedwith this long-overdue boxed set which is bursting with content that will keep you absorbed for weeks to come, especially if you're tempted to watch some again and again, as you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now where is the boxed set with their silent shorts? TRACY &amp; HEPBURN: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION ($59.98; Warner Bros.) -- Speaking of great duos, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn - two of the best movie actors of all time -- were just as famed for their discrete offscreen love as for their onscreen pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, I have to admit that fora team that only made 9 films, four of them are suspect (with Guess Who's Coming To Dinner rescued only by the poignance of Spence's final speech.) But five out of nine would be a good batting average andthose five are terrific fun: Woman Of The Year, Desk Set, Pat &amp; Mike, State Of The Union and above all Adam's Rib .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My idea of the perfect marriage is still something like their marvelous bickering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALL CREATURES GREAT &amp; SMALL: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ($349.98; BBC) -- ClassicRobin Williams As Dwight D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eisenhower In...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fall Movie Preview 2012: 'The Hobbit,' 'Django...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynyrd Skynyrd's RNC Gig Canceled Amid Hurricane...TV makes a great gift because it's timeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's my excuse for including this 2010 release which completely slipped by me when it came out in May a year and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a charming show about the life of a vet in rural England before and during WWII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I read the books as a kid, watched the show then and trust me, I am not an animal person in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's delightful and holds up very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This complete set contains all seven seasons plus the two Christmas specials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any fan of British TV or James Herriot will appreciate getting this at any time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST TITLES LISTED HERE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE FORMATS AND IN MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING DVD, BLURAY, DIGITAL DOWNLOAD, VOD, STREAMING AND THELIKE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE FORMAT LISTED IS THE FORMAT PROVIDED FOR REVIEW, NOT ALL THE FORMATSAVAILABLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT IS OFTEN THE MOST EXPENSIVE VERSION WITH THE MOST EXTRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DO CHECKINDIVIDUAL TITLES FOR AVAILABILITY IN ALL THEIR VARIOUS GUISES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and BluRays with the understanding that he would be considering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does not guarantee to review and he receives far more titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost EntertainmentRecency | PopularityComments 0 Pending Comments 0 View FAQ Comments are closed for this entry View All</p>
