Yep! FRAGMENTS *** out of **** BARYSHNIKOV ARTS CENTRE STANDING ON CEREMONY: THE GAY MARRIAGE PLAYS ** out of **** MINETTA LANE THEATRE Samuel Beckett sees the absurdity of existence, true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But too often productions of his work don't catch the humor in that absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's there however and the best Beckett-- whether it's Fiona Shaw buried up to her neck inHappy Days or this collection of five short works -- is shot through with humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're not easy laughs, butthey're there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one hour show demonstrates that nicely and it feels completely satisfying at this intense but brief length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Brook and Marie-Helene Estienne direct with precision and the uncredited costumes and sets are ideal, with equally good lighting by Philippe Vialatte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kathryn Hunter is first among equals in the three performers, but they all get achance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rough For Theatre I features Jos Houben and Marcello Magni as two men trapped in a desolate landscape, one missing a leg and the other missing his sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They banter and argue and warily circle each other, wondering if they can find some sort of safe companionship with this stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Houben and Magni have their moments but this feels the least realized of the works shown here and it doesn't earn the hoped-for shocking final image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; November 24, 2011 What Are They Eating For Thanksgiving?

The best productions usually are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standing On Ceremony doesn't shy away from easy laughs and why should it? The playwrights involved are all in a good mood as gay Americans see their marriages legally recognized by more and more states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why not have a laugh and celebrate? Everyone goes to weddings and feels free to criticize the flowers orlighting or music or food or what-have-you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So one can wish everyone well and celebrate expandingrights for all Americans and yet still point out that these plays are by and large quick ditties that soon fade from memory and that the production is a glorified reading, with actors lined up on stage at podiums and more often than not glancing at the scripts in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an amiable afternoon withtalented people and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The performance I caught did not include the piece by Joe Keenan (more's the pity since I love his novels and TV work).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But all the rest are fairly of a piece -- silly, light and not terribly memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is amiable too, with Harriet Harris stealing the show but everyone from Craig Bierko and Richard Thomas to Beth Leavel and Polly Draper to Mark Consuelos having a good line or affecting moment here andthere. "The Revision" by Jordan Harrison is a quickie joke about rewriting vows to reflect the reality of life (substituting "domestic partner or civil union" for "lawfully wedded," for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can see where it's MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

"This Flight Tonight" by Wendy MacLeod has two women leaving for their wedding in middle America and expressing their nervousness before reaffirming their love. "On Facebook" is a clever conceit by Doug Wright, who used the thread of an online argument about gay marriage to create his work, though unfortunately it's not lengthy or vivid enough to do more thandocument, as opposed to dramatize. "Strange Fruit" is Neil LaBute's effort and you won't be surprised that he reminds us that just because the marriages of gays and lesbians might be legally recognized in some states doesn't mean that gay bashing and other forms of hatred have suddenly disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LaBute is like the guest at a wedding talking about a friend's bitter divorce, though Bierko and Consuelos give the drama depth. "Traditional Wedding" byMo Gaffney shows two women getting married with one of them desperate to make sure they don't doanything by the books because she wants to avoid cliche. "Pablo &amp; Andrew At The Altar Of Words" is a weak finale by jose Rivera with two men exchanging their super sweet vows, which brings the evening full circle back to where it began and lets them toss bouquets into the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leaves two plays by Paul Rudnick and one by Moises Kaufman. "London Mosquitoes" by Kaufman features Richard Thomas giving a eulogy for his partner of 46 years, a prickly fellow apparently who was always smart and usually right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas does well by the monologue and it does contain a very sweet and romantic explanation for why the lover did NOT want to get married after it was legal for them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, the piece was too much of a greatest hits package, including 9-11, AIDS, gay marriage and a few other social landmarks I've probably forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the exceptional reaction it received from the audience, which was in a very warm mood throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Rudnick is last because he's always funniest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His pieces in The New Yorker are so hilarious you always want to pick up the phone and tell him so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he can just go to the theater and watch audiences howl over his work, both of which feature Harriet Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "My Husband," she berates her gay son(Consuelos) for not being married and parades in front of him the many examples of her friends whosesons are MUCH gayer than he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How can she compete? It ends on an absurdist, unsatisfying note that doesn't quite land but for a while it's very funny indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even better is Rudnick's "The Gay Agenda," in which Harris plays a housewife who gives a speech about trying to understand gay people but warning usabout the gay agenda and no, they can't have marriage because they already have everything else and theyshould leave something for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It grows increasingly hysterical and Harris increasingly funny, though she gets laughs the moment she steps up to the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If laughter is the best revenge, Harris is getting sweet revenge indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These playlets may do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They aren't designed to last forever, just to bring together audiences and actors and celebrate a happy moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if that's the only goal, they have our blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But like a real marriage you wonder, will thisone endure in 30 years through revivals? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hey, straight marriages fail just as often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale)The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Chinglish * 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Godspell ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Lake Water ** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Man And Boy * 1/2 Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Jenny From The Block's Fiat Commercial A Sham Bourbon Distillery To Obama: 'Give Us The Bird' PHOTOS: Pepper-Spraying Cop Makes His Way Throughout Art History Jack Wagner Confronted By Long Lost Daughter DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy Drexler We Can Be Thankful for Each Other Dylan Ratigan This Thanksgiving, Occupy Yourself More Entertainment News at THR.com Like 3K Like 184 Like 5K Like 224 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn's' Taylor Lautner On His Most Challenging Scene AndJacob's MassiveTransformation (Video) 'G.I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe' Sequel Crew Member Dies On Set Jennifer Lopez's Love For Bodysuits (Photos) Cynthia Nixon: Max Will TryHis First ThanksgivingStuffing READ MORE Miss Piggy KeepsPaparazzi at Bay byTossing Cupcakes READ MORE Melanie Amaro Reveals Her'True Self' on X Factor READ MORE Newsies ** Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 One Arm *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Silence!
