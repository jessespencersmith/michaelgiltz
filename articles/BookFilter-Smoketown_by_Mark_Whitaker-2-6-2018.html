Pittsburgh was also key in turning boxer Joe Louis into a national hero (even for white people),pushing for the integration of major league baseball and then giving Jackie Robinson the support he needed to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The city's contributions arguably climax with the rise of America's greatest playwright -- August Wilson. "Smoketown" has a wide- ranging story to tell and, at times, author Mark Whitaker's chapters feel like stand-alone articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a plus in way --you can read a chapter and then put the book down and come back later without feeling you've lost the thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also aminus, for each story feels a tad isolated from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is that "Smoketown" contains a lot of individual tales of triumph rather than one interwoven story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But people influence each other and eventually it coheres with the sad elegy provided by Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His masterwork of a ten play cycle set in Pittsburgh's Hill District can stand alongside the greatesttheatrical works in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here the funeral for Wilson becomes a funeral for the fading Hill District, black Pittsburghitself and all it accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many funerals, it's sad but ultimately joyous since there's so much good to remember. --Michael Giltz What Others Say “An expansive, prodigiously researched, and masterfully told history.” (Kirkus Reviews) “The fascinating and never-before-told story of Pittsburgh’s black renaissance—a vibrant and creative community that produced agreat black newspaper, a great black baseball team, a great black industrial tycoon, a great black painter, agreat black playwright, and some of the greatest black musical talent in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you, Mark Whitaker.”(Gail Lumet Buckley, author of The Hornes and The Black Calhouns) “Mark Whitaker says his remarkable mid-twentieth century Pittsburgh “was a black version of the story of early twentieth-century Vienna.” Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitakeris so riveting a storyteller that the reader even wonders if Belle Epoque Vienna had the equivalent of a BillyEckstine, Mary Lou Williams, Billy Strayhorn, Joe Louis, or an August Wilson.” (David Levering Lewis, PulitzerPrize-winning biographer of W.E.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Du Bois) “Mark Whitaker has given Pittsburgh's wondrously rich black culture its due at long last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoketown is illuminating history and an absolute delight to read.” (David Maraniss, author of Once in a Great City: A Detroit Story) “Who knew that Pittsburgh had an African American renaissance asvibrant as Harlem's and arguably more consequential? Mark Whitaker knew, and he rescues from unjust obscurityan American episode that continues to reverberate.” (George F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will, syndicated columnist) What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
