He might have continued in this literary, "New Yorker" friendly vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But LaValle has found his purchase inShare This Book About The Author Victor LaValle MoreVictor LaValle is the author of six previous works of fiction: three novels, two novellas,and a collection of short stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His novelshave been included in best-of-the-year listsby The New York Times Book Review, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, The Nation, … Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: June 13, 2017 Publisher: Spiegel &amp; Grau Pages: 448 ISBN 10: 0812995945 ISBN 13: 9780812995947subverting genres like sci-fi and horror, playing off H.P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovecraft and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here he begins in compelling mode, telling of the romance and marriage of a young couple up to the point when the wife Emma gives birth on a stalled subway train in a scene that is charm itself, down to the street performers who gamely hide the intimate moment from camera- phone wielding passengers peering in from other cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wife becomes more and more depressed(postpartum?) and the husband simply doesn't know what to do, other than beg her to keep taking the medicine she's beenprescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Things go truly off the rails in a way that will terrify any new parent, tapping into your darkest fears aboutwhether you (or your spouse) is up for the daunting task of raising a child to that moment when you realize the child has a mind of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part "Rosemary's Baby" (the movie, not the book), part Stephen King, LaValle's story is emotionally rich long before it treads into dark fantasy territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero Apollo Kagwa -- a latch-key kid turned avid purveyor of rare andprecious books -- is a memorable character, a father who does whatever he must to protect his child but never fails toremember you can't protect your child by destroying who you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's creepy and fun and unexpected and if I wasn't whollyon board by the end (horror isn't quite my thing), I have to respect a book that I put aside once or twice because it was freaking me out a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've just welcomed a newborn into the world, you might want to wait a while before reading this.... -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Advance praise for The Changeling “A dark fairy tale of New York, full of magic and loss, myth and mystery, love and madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Changeling is a mesmerizing, monumental work.” —Marlon James, author of A Brief History of Seven Killings “Like a good Coen brothers film, this genre-defying, achingly literate phantasmagoria of a novel will work every nook and cranny of the imagination, taking the reader to places we’re either too afraid to visit or never knewexisted.” —Paul Beatty, author of The Sellout “This year, the most unsettling novel I read, the scariest novel I read, and the most beautiful novel I read wereall the same one—Victor LaValle’s The Changeling .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A father who loses his wife and child in an act of horror must hunt them into metaphorical hell to get them back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This story feels less written, than channeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I say thiswithout exaggeration: It’s a masterpiece.” —Mat Johnson, author of Pym and Loving Day “LaValle has a knack for blending social realism with genre tropes, and this blend of horror story and fatherhood fable is surprising and admirably controlled.… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
