"Barracoon" also documents the plagiarism that Hurston's initial piece about Kossola contained, keeping it in the context of why and how itmight have occurred and how it never appeared again throughout her lengthy and distinguished career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then comes themain narrative that Hurston captured after returning to Alabama and spending months nearby, slowly winning Kossola's trust and thus gathering essential details rarely if ever captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Footnotes explain certain claims Hurston made with the best available information at the time and why scholars now make new judgements in certain areas and confirm her judgementin others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hurston told Lewis's story in his voice and went to great lengths to back it up with facts from other sources; thatwork continues here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His journey is an atypical "slave narrative," explaining the warring peoples in Africa and how one groupmight sell another into bondage. (Are we surprised that England and France warred for centuries and often despised each other? So why is it surprising in Africa? It too is a continent filled with diverse civilizations, after all.) Kossola's mournful, sometimes humorous voice comes through, along with Hurston's passion for the stories he digresses into, not to mention thecruelty of the court system and life in general for black people long after Reconstruction was abandoned by the governmentand betrayed by the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not a gripping story the way many slave narratives are, with their dramatic beats, heroicescapes and triumphs over evil crafted to win sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is history, with all its complications and refusal to tie up a story in a neat bow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It won't satisfy the casual reader looking for thrills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's an important addition to the work of Hurston and our knowledge of the lives uprooted by the slave trade. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Zora Neale Hurston’s genius has once again produced a Maestrapiece.” (Alice Walker, Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Color Purple ) “That Zora Neale Hurston should find and befriend Cudjo Lewis, the last living manwith firsthand memory of capture in Africa and captivity in Alabama, is nothing shy of a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barracoon is atestament to the enormous losses millions of men, women and children endured in both slavery and freedom—astory of urgent relevance to every American, everywhere.” (Tracy K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Life on Mars and Wade in the Water ) “Barracoon reinforces what those of us who love Hurston’s work have known all along: her keen intellect and curiosity was only surpassed by her genuine empathy for her subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This bookis not just an account of one man’s survival in the face of atrocity, it’s a celebration of language and tradition; aclear labor of love.” (Angela Flournoy, National Book Award Finalist and author of The Turner House) “Barracoonis a powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and at times, heart wrenching, account of one man’s story, eloquentlytold in his own language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zora Neale Hurston gives Kossola control of his narrative— a gift of freedom andhumanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It completely reinforces for me the fact that Zora Neale Hurston was both a cultural anthropologistand a truly gifted, and compassionate storyteller, who sat in the sometimes painful silence with Kossola and thedepth and breadth of memory as a slave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such is a narrative filled with emotions and histories bursting at theintricately woven seams.” (Nicole Dennis-Benn, author of Here Comes the Sun) What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
