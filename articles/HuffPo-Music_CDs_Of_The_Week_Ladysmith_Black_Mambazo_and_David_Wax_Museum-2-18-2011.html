So if you have adventurous ears and like music from all sorts of genres, keep checking in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week, I'll start with two albums: one is by a world-class act and the other is a new talent that's very promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump Rip Each Other In Heated Political War Of Words PlayStation Network Could Be Down For Days FOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Royal Wedding | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: The Funniest People Not On TwitterMiranda Kerr &amp; Orlando Bloom Step Out To 'The The Funniest Someecards For Easter 2011Weekly Roundup of eBay Vintage Clothing Finds News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 20K Like 4K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCALLADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO -- SONGS FROM A ZULU FARM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've probably been taking this legendary South African act for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like most people, I was introduced to Ladysmith Black Mambazo by Paul Simon's landmark Graceland .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led me to the classic compilation The Indestructible Beat Of Soweto Volume One and a wealth of great African talent, foremost among them this brilliant vocal group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought I was a fan until I saw them in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Onrecord, their voices are beautiful and charming; in concert, the precision, technical mastery andoverwhelming beauty of what they do hits you with full force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the wake of Graceland , Ladysmith Black Mambazo signed with Warner Bros. for a while, heard their songs in movies and TV shows and commercials and became a popular touring act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eventually, the spotlight faded a bit and they settled back onto smaller labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like some people, I probably felt I had'enough" Ladysmith Black Mambazo albums at some point, as if you could have "enough" jazz or"enough" Rolling Stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So every once in a while I'd check in when an album seemed especially notable,but not always with the same passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Songs From A Zulu Farm made me a fan all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a great introduction to new fans and a career capper for an act that has produced excellent music for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The songs are traditionals they learned growing up in the rural farms of South Africa. "Imithi Gobakahle" calls in the kids from the rain,promising them they can go back outside as soon as it stops. "Ntulube" is a song to sing when you wantto swim in the river -- throw in a stone and if the ripples are clean, it's safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If not, there might be a snakeor other creature around and the song can chase them away. "Vuka" is a tune to wake up baby chicks inthe morning so they can eat the food you're bringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's even a spin on "Old MacDonald." You cango to MySpace and listen to the music on Songs From A Zulu Farm right now .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here's a recent video of them in concert also doing one of the tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not great audio but it's always good to glimpse them live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their performances are playful and warm -- Ladysmith has always had a flair for performance but rarely Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

The highlight performance for me was the greatcombination of Mumford &amp; Sons followed by The Avett Brothers and then both bands backing Bob Dylan on "Maggie's Farm." Well, David Wax Museum -- inevitably referred to as an Americana band -- would have fit right in on that stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in their case, the "Americana" label is particularly apt since they drawn on Mexican as well as US folk tradition for an exuberant, timeless sound that is distinctive but instantly familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like on theirsingle, "Born With A Broken Heart." It's a great opener and the album Everything Is Saved doesn't disappoint. "Yes, Maria, Yes" and "Chuchumbe" are similarly infectious, while "Si, Te Vas" and "Night Was A Car" have a woozy, fadedglamour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can go to their website to find out how David Wax from Missouri and Suz Slezak from Virginia fell in love with folk music (including styles south of the border) and joined forces to lead DavidWax Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can go to MySpace and check out all the music right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, any hip band worth its salt is going to pull out the accordion every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But how many also boast the quijada, the jarana and the requinto? Sometimes it sounds like a front porch sing-along, other times you're in a packed bar downing beers and every once in a while, they just sound heartbroken enough to be singing alone (the closer "Wait For Me") TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Royal Wedding Guest ListRevealed: Who's Going?
