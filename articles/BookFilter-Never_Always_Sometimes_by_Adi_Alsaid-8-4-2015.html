It's part of who they are,but they realize they've also missed out and dismissed a lot of their classmates by considering them types (the Jock,the Geek) instead of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Becoming popular (or at least friendly with others) isn't so bad and suddenly our herofinds himself dating a girl, a really cool girl, even though he's been pining for the heroine for all of his life despite thefacf that THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE! The book goes on past where I thought it would end, which is a good thing.Alsaid creates some real characters here and their journey isn't neatly schematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dialogue is amusing, thestunts they engage in (like building a tree fort lunch spot overnight) sometimes cinematic but still within the realm ofreality) and the romance/friendship at the heart of it has real weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Green (and Judy Blume and S.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hintonand Sherman Alexie) would approve. -- MIchael GIltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
