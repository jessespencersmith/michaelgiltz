But for now let's celebrate this massive set which contains 55 discs and all 203 episodes (plus the pilot) from Michael Landon's classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not a lavish box -- it's just simple cardboard with a photo album ofsorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I love the fact that the DVDs are housed in soft, individual sleeves rather than the horrible scratchy cardboard sleeves so many boxed sets use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's very easy to thumb through and go right to the DVD you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At barely $1 per episode, it's also a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what's your pick for the best familydrama of them all? FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS THE COMPLETE SERIES ($129.95; Universal) -- Like a football player scratching and clawing his way to the end zone, this scrappy series somehow fought off low ratings, a disastrous drop in quality for season two and a weird release pattern (with new episodes ultimately appearing on Direct TV and reruns popping up months later on NBC) to survive and flourish for fiveyears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first season is nigh on perfect and should have won the Best Drama Emmy, along with a clutchload of awards for the excellent cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who knows what might have happened with that attention? As it was, the show enjoyed a Cinderella finale by winning a writing Emmy and long overdue Best ActorEmmy for Kyle Chandler, which will have to be the symbolic victory for Connie Britton, Scott Porter, ZachGilford (especially for his meltdown in season four) and all the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set is compact and fits right alongside your other DVDs (something I believe most DVD collectors prefer.) It's beautiful to look at and features lots of colorful photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DVDs are housed inside slipcovers you must slide them out of(generally a bad thing that can lead to scratches) but the cardboard is so glossy and smooth, I thinkthey're going to be well-protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very fun show (I never watch football, by the way) and a strong family drama with a loving marriage at its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just skip season two!

Which Hollywood Legend Is A Herman Cain Supporter? The Roots Greet Michele Bachman With 'Lyin' Ass Bitch' Like 4KV: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON ($49.99 BluRay or $39.99 DVD; Warner Bros.) -- That's the heartbreak of TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great shows often stay on the air too long and wear out their welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And promising shows with low ratings get cancelled without notice and can't wrap up their storylines with any sense of finality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's very very rare that a show with a continuing story gets to say goodbye the right way, like Lost or Breaking Bad (which is making 18 more episodes and calling it quits).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; V is one of those sad cases of a show that stumbled out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It started to find its footing creatively but by then the disastrous programming move of airing a few episodes (ABC called it "an event") and then pausing for weeks ormonths before airing more and the clear lack of faith by cutting back the season two order before the show even began meant it would grind to a halt without any fitting conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's the case for most shows in TV history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like the show, what are ya' gonna do? IN TREATMENT SEASON THREE ($59.99; HBO) -- If you're like me, you probably latch onto certain therapy sessions and watch only them in this series about Gabriel Byrne's Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weston and his clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This season, the only sessions that interest me are the ones between Weston and HIS therapist Amy Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching him spar using all the knowledge at his disposal is fascinating and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for hispatients, there's a reason therapists get paid to sit there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, that's not fair -- it's a fine concept this show,but it's tricky to pull off and their stories just didn't do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON TWITTER 1of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Holidays Film Issues scotland Europe Conservative Party Gas &amp; Oil Business Black Friday Buy a link here Sponsored Links 57-Year-Old Mom Looks 25 Her clever $6 Wrinkle Therapy Angers Botox Doctors. www.iconsumerknowledge.com New Trick in TENNESSEE If you drive 25 mi/day or less you better read this...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insurance.Comparisons.org Charmin® Coupons Have All The Softness You Need With Charmin®.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sign Up For Coupons! charmin.com/toilet-paper-coupons MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » The Smartest Show On TV Proves It With Secret Scene Like 936 elizrael RetweetFox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Don't Watch Any News: Study http://t.co/klJgOR3q theellenshow RetweetI'm so thankful for @MarloThomasand Jennifer Aniston and the incredible work they do for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can help them. http://t.co/8e6dEDOCTOR WHO: DAY OF THE DALEKS ($34.98; BBC/2Entertain) -- The Daleks are the archest of arch-enemies in the world of Doctor Who.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This two disc set with the Jon Pertwee Doctor and Katy Manning as the sidekick features a storyline that first aired in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I know that the Doctor Who reboot features much improved budgets and effects (though I'd still argue the emphasis is onimagination).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But surely the charm of this period was the rock-bottom budgets they worked with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, this set contains a second DVD devoted to a special edition featuring re-recorded Dalek voices and extra special effects to make it more exciting and modern. (Granted, the effects are retro, but still.) Whata terrible, terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank goodness the original version is offered and they have some strong extrasthroughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But adding in new effects and the like is a horrible waste of money and deeply misguided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CALL ME FITZ SEASON ONE ($39.98; EOne) -- Okay, cut me some slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV offers such a remarkable array of programming these days, it's hard to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Make that "impossible." Every channel knows the only way to stick out is with original shows, so everyone from VS to satellite networks like Direct TV are investing in new series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So even though I'm a fan of Jason Priestley, I have to admit that Ididn't know a thing about this show until the DVDs showed up on my door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This comedy stars Priestley as a sleazy car salesman who seems to prefer to close the deal with the ladies in the backseat rather than in the front office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Two starts in November on this half hour black comedy and hey, I'm ready todive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As soon as I catch up with Sons Of Anarchy .....KOJAK SEASON TWO ($44.99; Shout) -- Who loves ya, baby? Now it might seem a little silly -- a cop with a catch phrase? -- but at the time Telly Savalas and his show were hailed by police departments as pushing forward the authenticity of cop shows. it celebrated Kojak's Greek heritage, showed the Lieutenant as a man who knew the streets and at times bent the rules but without any nefarious orcrooked reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It began as a Top 10 smash hit, dropped to #14 this season and was soon out of the Top 30 altogether, despite a switch to shooting on the streets of NYC for added color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set contains all 25 episodes of season two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST OF ANTIQUES ROADSHOW ($19.99; PBS) -- What's the opposite of appointment TV? I don't mean TV you avoid, but TV that you don't necessarily DVR or make a concerted effort to watch but when you stumble upon it or need a diversion, it's always there for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Cops , but for the more sophisticated, Antiques Roadshow is good "stumble-upon" TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each episode has a soothing, rambling pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But let's face it: the moment we love is when the person discovers that grandpa's doodad is wildly valuable or that the painting they secretly believed was an unsigned masterpiece is in fact a cheap reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This single DVD set contains almost three hours of such moments, including "Simply The Best," "Trash To Treasure" and the slightly less fun "Politically Correct."BORED TO DEATH SECOND SEASON ($39.98; HBO) -- Thank God for DVRs and DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It used to be that if you missed the beginning of a TV series, you either had to jump in and remain a little lost until years later when syndication filled in the blanks or you just stayed away for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now you can dive in at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I admit this quirkier than thou HBO series about a failed writer and amateur detective(Jason Schwartzman) and his oddball friends (Zach Galifianakis and Ted Danson) put me off with its oddball pacing and what I perceived as its desire to be so strange you had to love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its third season has just begun and fans insist it's improved every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So now I can sample a new episode ortwo and if I'm intrigued enough, jump back to the start and see it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BIONIC WOMAN SEASON 3 ($39.98; Universal) -- Okay, even as a kid I knew the show was over when the bionic dog showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsay Wagner was a fine actress (she even won the Emmy in season two) but her show had been abruptly (and rather bizarrely) cancelled by ABC even though it was ranked #14 for the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is almost inconceivable today for a new show (even a spin-off).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, ABCrealized the bionic gravy train was over, but most networks would still have squeezed out every bit ofratings they could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NBC snatched the show up but dumped it on its moribund Saturday night at 8 p.m. slot, where they hadn't had a real hit since Get Smart a decade earlier. (When Adam-12 and Emergency showed life, NBC quickly moved them to better nights.) Of course, Jamie was kept apart from her true love Steve Austin because she was now on a different network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So she had a new boyfriend, that darn dogand by the end she was tired and ready to retire and got her wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now tell me, what is TV's greatest family drama of all-time?
