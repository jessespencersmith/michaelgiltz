It's a big story, so hold on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Centuries ago, an imaginary city sits at the crossroads of major trade routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For many years, three powers have battled over this city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each time one of them gains control, they rename the city in their own image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thenafter a few decades, they're toppled and someone else takes over and renames the city yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The locals have given upShare This Book About The Author Faith Erin Hicks MoreFaith Erin Hicks is a writer and artist in Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her graphicnovels include Zombies Calling, The War atEllsmere, Brain Camp (with Susan Kim and Laurence Klavan), Friends with Boys,Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong (with Prudence Shen), the Bigfoot Boy series … Release Info List Price: $21.99 (Hardcover) Published: April 04, 2017 Publisher: First Second Pages: 256 ISBN 10: 1626721599 ISBN 13: 9781626721593and simply dub their home The Nameless City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Book One, we met two young people from vastly different realms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaidu is the bookish son of a warrior whose country rules over the City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rat is a street urchin who found refuge among the monks when Kaidu's army slaughtered her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somehow, they become friends and are caught up in the endless political machinations that one finds in any Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After an assassination plot climaxed book one, this entry dubbed "The StoneHeart" focuses around the library/home of the monks that gives it this title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's so effective here is how Hicks hascreated such rich characters who play off one another in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaidu may be a bookish lad who refuses to seethe citizens of the Nameless City as trash, but his warrior father is actually quite sympathetic to his son's attitude. (It's the boy's mother who is the real warrior and savvy power broker.) Attempts to share control of the city with the other two major powers is met with derision and distrust both inside and out the City, not least among the warriors who don't fancygiving up power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rat and Kaidu are always at the heart of things, but they don't have so much sway or ability that we seethem as superheroes: they are simply young people desperately trying to stay above water in a world that is crashing downaround them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's exciting, vividly drawn and where the heck is book three? Think of this as a young adult graphic novel equivalent to the alternate histories written by Guy Gavriel Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who criticize Hicks for misappropriation of historical facts as if this were some Oriental stereotyping are confusing condescension with creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, this is an historical worknot set in any particular Asian time or place and it does make use of elements from different eras and societies, albeit withrespect and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its panoply of characters of every race and hue (and heroes and villains on all sides) clearly shows a respect for genuine peoples and cultures that any reader will absorb and then hopefully pursue on their own with interest. - - Michael Giltz What Others Say Reviews for Book One Of The Nameless City Trilogy: Included in School Library Journal's and Kirkus's "Best of 2016" list, and NYPL's "Notable 100 Best Books for Kids".
