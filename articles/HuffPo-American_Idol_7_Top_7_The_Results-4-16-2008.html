And I domean massive, it was #1 for 16 weeks -- that'sfour months in a row! NO SONG should ever beplayed that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Idol kids frankly made a mess of it; this did no favors to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LaterElliot Yamin (who just lost his mom -- mysympathies) sang "Free" and then Mariah Carey sang "Bye Bye." They started splitting the top 7 into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On one side was Jason Castro and Carly Smithson and on the other David Cook and Kristy Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this point, I wrote down, "David Archuleta will golast" because of course everyone knows anyone with the initials "D" and "A" will always be safe soputting him in one group or the other would end the suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, hats off to Archuleta fornever seeming to acknowledge his front-runner status and yet not play it with false modesty either.He just goes with the flow, wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then it became Jason Castro and Carly Smithson and Syesha onone side and David Cook and Kristy Lee Cook and Brooke White on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I admit I was a littleflummoxed here and wasn't quite sure but just assumed Archuleta would be in David Cook's gang.Then they switched Cook with Syesha (the sneaky bastards) and suddenly it made more sense andclearly Syesha and Kristy Lee and Brooke were the bottom three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They brought Archuleta out, told him he was safe (brief but not annoying sigh of relief from him -- again, this is a very difficult tightrope he's walking since EVERYONE knew he was safe) and thenRyan told him to choose which group he thought was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Archuleta has been watching thisshow all his life and he knew enough to pull the old "I'm sitting in the middle" stunt until theymade the obvious clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

(This could help to humanize her with the people who think she has too high an opinion of her own talent.) When asked to pickbetween Kristy and Brooke, Siimon rather politely (I thought) said sorry Kristy, but it's your nightfinally, sweetheart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone booed and he responded, quite reasonably, "Well, it has to be ONE ofthem." No wonder he gets the most applause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy boasts that at least she made it into the top 10which is absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hardly a slam on your talent to make it farther than 100,000+ otherfolk who auditioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy is going home, Brooke cried (of course) and Kristy sang the first part of"Forever" right to Simon in a cute moment. (It's funny, but Simon likes the attention of speakingout but doesn't really want to be in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can relate, said the blogger.) I was wrong(again) about who was going home but it was perfectly appropriate for Kristy to say bye-bye thisweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AND HERE IS MY ORIGINAL POST ON PERFORMANCE NIGHT FOR MARIAH CAREY WEEK First, my apologies to Mariah Carey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought she would be a disaster as a coach and that a week devoted to her songs would be a mountain of melisma overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carey appeared focused and helpful, giving those who seemed receptive very specific suggestions as far as melody, runs, and arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And with only seven songs to hear and most of the kids wisely choosing from her earliest hits, we avoided the recent run of hip-hop influenced songs that have very little melody for other singers to dive into -- they might be good singles, but they don't make good songs. (It's the Grammy distinction between Record of the Year -- ie. best single -- and Song of the Year, ie best standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe you like her current hit "Touch My Body" as a single but it's not a song that you'd want to hear lots of people sing, unlike, say "Hero.") Carey by the way has sold 160 million albums worldwide, 62 million of them in the US. (Clearly, she's even bigger overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember my dad's adult amah/maid in Hong Kong absolutely lovedMariah Carey with the intense devotion only a teenager in America could begin to approach.) Andas they mentioned on Idol , she just passed Elvis Presley with the most #1 hits by a solo artist and will soon pass the Beatles for the all-time record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally dismissed by critics, it's telling that twoof the seven songs performed tonight weren't written by her. (I would have sworn someone wouldtackle the Motown gem "I'll Be There" as well just to avoid her songwriting.) Again, even if you likeher music, those high-pitched notes that "sell" them are nigh on impossible to hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta -- Sings her Oscar-winning song "When You Believe" from the animated film The Prince of Egypt. (A duet with Whitney Houston, it was a Top 20 hit written by Broadway's Stephen Schwartz who went on to pen the biggest hit musical of his long career, Wicked .) Hilariously, Carey urged Archuleta to go for that falsetto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though she would prove savvier as thenight went on, this was exactly what I expected her to do since Carey LIVES for falsetto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She hopedhe would follow her advice, Mariah said modestly, as in, "Boy, you BEST follow my advice." He did.Archuleta was decked out in leather pants for his naughtiest look yet, albeit in service to yetanother message-y tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If ever his diva hands (the inability to sing without gesturing dramaticallywith your palms) was appropriate, surely Mariah Carey week was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archuleta was popping his"p's" very noticeably tonight and the inevitable runs and trills were kind of weak in the lowerregister and towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, this is what I expected on Mariah Carey night: a feeling thatthe singers were offering two notes for the price of one at every possible juncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I felt he was finebut not spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy raved, giving the first standing ovation of the season, Paula seemed halfasleep as she would throughout the night (maybe she was under the weather) but praised him andSimon also said he was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also joked after what one imagined was the first of many balladsthat we weren't going to have a lot of laughs this week, a joke that went right over sweet littleDavid Archuleta's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Give the kid points for being a little oblivious to his surroundings: whengirls are squealing your name, a casual friendly attitude that quietly acknowledges thepandemonium you're creating is a good approach to not looking falsely modest or too pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ithought the judges had over-praised, but on a second listen I up-graded him from pretty good togood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His growl was effective and the runs not as forced as I originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly Smithson -- Sang "Without You," a song made famous by the great singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson, though ironically it was originally written and recorded by Badfinger. (Do buy Nilsson Sings Newman, Nilsson Schmilsson and his standards album A Little Touch Of Nilsson In The Night if you want to live a happier life.) Carly was a bit dull at first, though it's always refreshing when people don't over-sing, especially on Mariah Carey week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, there's always an unpleasant tension on the high notes from Carly but she scaled the heights in a so-so manner.

Will one of them come back tomorrow night and say that after listening to the playbackthey realized they'd missed a great performance? They should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the only one of the night Irecorded onto DVD and it's a major rebound from last week for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope the voters heard what Iheard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke White -- Sang "Hero," one of Mariah's many #1 hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke had a good pre-song interview, joking about her tendency to cry, this time over the fact that she missed her sister'swedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bizarrely, Brooke said, "She was understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sent me a text. 'I'm glad you'rethere.'" First, duh -- of course she understands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke is in the middle of a talent contest on thebiggest show on TV and if she could get away she would have loved to have been at her sister'swedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they only texted each other? You mean Brooke didn't speak to her by cell on herwedding day? That's a little odd. "Hero" was a very good choice for Brooke, proven as soon as shestrummed it on her guitar for Mariah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the performance, she played the piano and it soundedlike it fit right into her singer-songwriter wheelhouse, more Carole King (again!) than MariahCarey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Brooke tried to get overly soulful in the bridge and then she lost the melody completely,panicked and rushed through the rest of the song, going faster and faster as she approached the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy was mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Paula, who I suspected was tired or a little ill, proved especially perceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After insisting that "every ounce of you is totally authentic to who you are," she pointed out that Brooke got a bit lost and flipped out. "Don't ever let that speed you up," she counseled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon dropped the hammer on Brooke with an elaborate hamburger metaphor that for some reason I found quite amusing, especially when Randy and Paula insisted Simon was wrong to say it was all bun and no meat and he responded fine, then there was meat but no lettuce or tomato or relish or onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee Cook -- Sang "Forever," the first single from the massive hit Daydream that DIDN'T hit #1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was actually scared for Kristy since Mariah Carey week seemed designed to torpedo her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mariah insisted she liked Kristy's arrangement of the song better than the one Mariahrecorded. (At least, I assume Mariah was referring to the arrangement and not Kristy's actualvocals, no offense Miss Cook.) It's a very weird sort of performance, with Kristy diving into thesecond line so abruptly I thought she'd messed up or forgotten the words for a moment but she didit consistently again and again every time she got to those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was very draggy and rough whennot just odd and surely the first time Mariah has been covered with a steel guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy lookedgreat, but at the end there was a weird close-up of her that turned out to be a camera focused onone of the video monitors in the auditorium -- something we realized as the song was finishing andthe camera began to pull back from the monitor and we realized that Kristy was actually far awayon the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more than the simple step of ending with the camera far far away from thesinger (which dampens any emotional finale), this was a very distracting, cold technique that couldsubliminally hurt her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy was indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula vehemently disagreed and said Kristy was greatand happily suggested Kristy was diabolically pretending not to be a very good singer in the past soshe could keep improving and sneak up on everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon was nonplussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think they're justwaiting for her to get eliminated and have nothing to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was four women in a row, by theway, when the more obvious arrangement would have been girl-boy-girl-boy-girl-boy-girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I Computers India Barack Obama Michelle Obama Sports Olympics Housing Crisis Fox News Cars MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

(He really does have some of the most interesting gaps of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who hasn't heard of a luau?) Paula retorted that she'd LOVE to be at that luau listening to Castro all night long and in this case I agree with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Significantly, she also zeroed in on his strong suit: confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She may have been sleepy tonight, but she was paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon was also very laudatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bottom Three -- I think all three men are completely safe this week, especially since the only negative comment about any of them was Randy's luau diss of Jason Castro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With more women, the bottom three will come from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have to believe the audience heard what I heard fromSyesha so I'm hoping the bottom three is Carly, Kristy and Brooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy was the most forgettableand Brooke the most disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly wasn't very good either and she did go second, but mightbenefit from the very wide appeal of her song "Without You." That leaves Kristy and Brooke in thebottom two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy was given the worst presentation by the producers but Simon really dropped thehammer on Brooke (who again couldn't keep from talking while the judges critiqued her).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thinkBrooke is going home in a very tight vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who did you like and who do you think is going home?

Overal the singers did a pretty good job singing songs Ithought would be a trainwreck of a night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's my rankings:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook- even though he wasn't spot on, his emotional strength came thru and I really liked this a Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:15 AM on 04/19/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:02 AM on 04/19/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:01 AM on 04/19/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:50 PM on 04/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:41 AM on 04/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:23 AM on 04/17/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 7: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-7-m_b_96896.html [4/5/2009 7:08:32 PM] lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only one I'll buy on Itunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he did get a pass from the judges due to his brother's condition but who cares he sang well and he deserved the praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also like the guy more since he doesn't trot out the sympathy card. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee- I know alot of folks didn't like her singing but I felt she did a good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I actually voted for her. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David A- I don't know where this kid gets all this loving from the judges, I wasn't that impressed withthe singing and I forgot what he sang when he finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I do remember he sang well compared to the last 4 singers. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha/Carly/Jason- I grouped these three together, none of them really did anything for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldalso barely hear Jason at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly did look good, at least covering the tats for once.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke- snoozeville..........plus she messed up the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Libsrule See Profile I'm a Fan of Libsrule permalink Well once again I'm commenting about a show I really don't like that much but my comments Michael(and you KNOW I love your reviews) are the following: It's PASSED not PAST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as far as outselling, I have to take it into the context of the times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IF the Beatles just hit the gate today with the same results as they once did, then their records would probably be in the BILLION range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One has got to look at how marketing, and reach are conducted today vs "yesterday"(sorry I couldn't resist) not to mention the wide demographics out there vs the limited ones back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back them the only people making The Beatles popular were simply the young teenagers and some college aged young ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todays listeners have been brought up more accepting of new music andthat extends to grandmothers and fathers as opposed to 1964 when no "decent adult" would listen toeither one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as far as talent goes, well Ms Carey may be popular but let's be honest, Elvis and especially The Beatles have/had more talent in their little toes than Ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carey will have in her entire lifetime andbeyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUT for the AI stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still can't handle it Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really can't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just seems so shallow even by Hollywood "standards".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUT I am glad you are enjoying it and I can read about instead of having to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Libsrule, thanks for the copyediting -- I've changed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My mind must have slipped for a moment (that's what happens when you post at 2 in the morning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mariah Carey has amassedmore #1s than Elvis but the #1 is a much easier spot to hit these days for countless reasons.Times always change so it's hard to compare different eras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suffice to say that Elvis and theBeatles were massively successful in their day chart-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as for sales, despite that 160mil, Carey still has a long way to go to match the Beatles and Elvis worldwide (though Godhelp us at this rate she might).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elvis has sold perhaps 1 billion albums and singles worldwide,though that includes singles which the Carey 160 mil total does not.The Beatles are alsoroundly estimated to have sold one billion albums and singles worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for talent, noone equals the Beatles as a band and few can match Elvis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Couldn't agree with you more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if my roundup lets you stay informed without having to actually watch the darn thing, then I've achieved my goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if only I could sing outside the shower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charity See Profile I'm a Fan of Charity permalink jason has no singing voice. he is the sanjaya of this season, though much more likeable and reallyknows how to work "authentic." just like brooke knows how to work "authentic.". like the saying goes"all you need is sincerity and when you can fake that, you've got it made. et tu, jason and brooke. i still fail to understand why the hate for syesha. she's not the best singer in all of AI history but she in no way deserves the constant negativity heaped on her by the judges, especially simon. she sings ringsaround jason and brooke, gives carly a go for her money, and is far more palatable than david cook. ah, david cook. sorry to hear about his brother, but cook just doesn't cut it for me. however, that being said, i'm sure he has a nice career ahead of him screetching his way through rock history on the heels of other's arrangements. carly is a fine belter of a singer. and as a side note here - in miami, "without you" sung by harry nilsson was a huge hit. i barely remember the badfinger version. i was a nilsson fan from the early days, btw, Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:23 AM on 04/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:19 AM on 04/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:24 AM on 04/17/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 7: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-7-m_b_96896.html [4/5/2009 7:08:32 PM] so my memory is only of the version by the man himself. kristy did okay, and i was actually kind of surprised as to how she hangs in there. as for david a.: the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for reading, Charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're absolutely right about "Without You." it was only an album track for Badfinger and didn't chart for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was a massive smash in Miami (I grew upin Ft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lauderdale, by the way) and all around the country, staying at #1 for four weeks, by farthe biggest hit of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His other big hit? "Everybody's Talkin'" after being used inMidnight Cowboy, another song Nilsson didn't write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironic since he wrote such great songs, like "One" which became a hit for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suppose Jason really is a far more palatable Sanjaya, with the key difference that despite his lack of vocal skills, I wouldnt mind hanging out while he strummed a guitar and sang a tune or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not true of Sanjaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your other comments are spot on as well. 67bug See Profile I'm a Fan of 67bug permalink God, they were such boring songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know what the big deal is about Mariah, I'm so happy that Igrew up listening to Grace Slick and Janis Joplin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guess it's all about the almighty dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Imagine a Grace Slick week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who could tackle "White Rabbit?"

" I actually did NOT like this arrangement of "Always Be My Baby." David"s pitch wobbledfrequently in the lower registers throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a daring arrangement, and Blake Lewis"s take onBon Jovi"s "You Give Love a Bad Name" already proved that risk-taking is prized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn"t go back andlisten again, but perhaps I"ll do it tonight before the results show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course he"s safe. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason " After last week"s "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" success, I think Jason is going to be a huge star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His version of "I Don"t Wanna Cry" was more of what makes him so unique, and provides insight into how he"d show up as a songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seemed so much more comfortable in the last two weeks than I"ve ever seen him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I predicted he"d go out next week, but I am withdrawing that prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here"s my predictions now:7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke White6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee Cook5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly Smithson4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha Mercado3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Castro2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldn't be at all surprised if it were an all male final three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itseems far more likely the women will fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're right, Archuleta is still a boy, but he's a cutekid and there's every reason to think he'll be a good-looking man since he's past pubertyalready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hated Brooke's pouty face as well during the critiques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree wholeheartedly aboutCook this week -- I was really surprised the judges had no complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Jason is certainlydoing everything right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never on Idol has someone gone so far on sheer saviness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's seehow your predicitons turn out, especially the all-male top three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could be right. epotruchyeahright See Profile I'm a Fan of epotruchyeahright permalink Part Two 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha -- Technically a beautiful rendition of Vanishing, one of my favorite Mariah tunes from the Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:20 PM on 04/16/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:29 AM on 04/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:55 PM on 04/16/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:31 AM on 04/17/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:09 PM on 04/16/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:36 AM on 04/17/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 7: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-7-m_b_96896.html [4/5/2009 7:08:32 PM] first album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had predicted that she'd stumble this week and get eliminated, but now I'm not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her biggest problem is that she thinks she's better than she actually is, as in she attempts these songsto prove to America that she's as good as Whitney or Mariah or Celine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Simon said, she's just not that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still she was better than 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke -- Total disaster with "Hero." I had to close my eyes when she performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her rushing started earlier than when others have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her pitch was all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I"m a little tired of the nasally honk that escapes her mouth so often when she sings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It"s a fine affectation once in a while, but she seems to overplay it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also am tired of her not standing there quietly when the judges are talking, even if she"s being polite by saying "Thank you." Hated her pouty face after Simon"s burger/bun analogy.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy " Actually liked this performance of "Forever."

Carly Smithson: So close and yet so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first half of the song was unforced and very effective and then, as always, she 'deep sixed' it by pushing way too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha Mercado: Ditto the above...very, very nice and then she screamed her way through the end of the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a snore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To do what she wanted to do necessitates the tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke White: Please, please, not another week of that weak stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really couldn't be more alienated by bad singing and that pouty affect during the judges critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please stop talking and check on the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee Cook: Brooke White is starting to make Kristy look like Mahalia Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook: Really not his best and his usually spot-on intonation was in complete disarray through all of the early parts in his lower register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extreme over praise from the judges out of sympathy? Jason Castro: Give him credit...as one of the contestants who should have suffered the most from Mariah night, he pulled a rabbit out of the hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principally, it was engaging and confident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 pages total) You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!
