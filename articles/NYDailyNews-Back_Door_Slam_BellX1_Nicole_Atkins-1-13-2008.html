"l was playng all the time," says Knowles, who can't e'ait to tum 21. (In the lJ.S., he says it's armoying not to be able to buy a beer at the bars he's play- ing.) "Early moning l'd plav before school, during school at breaks I'd plav. on the bus on the way back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I stiLl do play alt the time. "Then my parents bought me a Span- jsh Fuitar," says Knowles. "lt *'as three- quarters size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had to play that for a year before they'd buy me an electric guitar The electric guitar I got was a Stratocaster I tried to patch it up like Rory Gallagher's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looked terible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the end, me and my friend finished it with this metallic blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've taken muchbetter cile of my guitars since then-" And now they're touring the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New to the set list this time tround might be a Willie Dixon cover, "Walking the World," md the Robert Cmy song that gave the band its nme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what- ever they rip into, Knowles h6 already proven he cm strike feil into muicim fwice his age: As a teen, he would sit in with a local blues band whose members were as old as his dad until the lead gui trist got a litde irked md slowly edged the mnderkind out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wu Knowles starting to play better thm him? "Oh, I might have been," ad- mits Knowles with a laugh. t (l an. 23, the Me rc ury Lounge: 272-260- 4700.) Bmds used to drem of getting their year-old, whose group plays at Joe's Pub Ireland and showed that their compelling songs on fie radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the lrish group on Jan. 16 (and the Bowery Ballroom pop music with sing-along choruses and Bell X I is hoping to conquer the U.S. the in March).

'The girl group [somdl almost cme by accident," says Atkins, who perforrre at tie Bowery Ballroom Jan. 25. .lVhen I was making ny demo, neitier I nor my friend David MuUer were good lead guitar players at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I sang all the guitar parts md hmonized it, md suddenly it morphed into a girl-group somd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it w6 more out of necessity tim out of intention." Still, the 29-year-old composer of epic tunes like "]-he Way It Is" md 'Brooklyn's on Fire" admits that the sound - think of a female Chris lsaak, modern but witi one eye on the retr- view minor - isn'l entirely out of tie blue. "The songs I love are 30 or 40 yearsold and have that big sound," says At- kins. 'It's fumy how eYerybody makes a fuss about the grandness of the sound. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're sick of mmic being made on computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irt's make m6ic with real itrtruments once in a while." Not that Atkins isn't enmored with technolog/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A major fan of filmmaker David Lynch, it's clear how well she'd get along with the oddtlall director when she describes some idem she has for her stage show. "This is going to sound weird but if you saw it, it would look really cool: I want to film my twin cousins sing- ing backup voals and dressed up as ghosts," says Atkins- '"l-trey'd be pro- jected onto two screens on each side of the stage md there would be a trig- ger so they would be singing prerecord- ed backup vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between songs we'd intemct with them - like if they're gig- gling I'd say, 'Shush!'md they would get quiet. -..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for now we would just be happyto geta lighting guy." a (J an- 25, Bowery Ballroom; 212- 533-211 I)9. â‚¬ o= z E zm{o ac= o o L I 7 -@ c am</p>
