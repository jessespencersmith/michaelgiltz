Read More: Dvds, Grey's Anatomy , Movies, Peter Cook , Private Practice , Shelley Duvall , Smallville , Th Big Lebowski , TV Shows , Entertainment News You can talk about plot twists and dumb storylines and internal strife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I can tell youthe main problem with Grey's Anatomy SeasonFour ($59.99; ABC Studios) -- that problem is Private Practice First Season ($39.99; ABCStudios). (That comes out on Tuesday, September16.) It never fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone launches a successfulseries, a show that brings them acclaim and bigratings and will literally make them rich for life.So do they focus on that show and try to make itas good as it can possibly be? Sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butusually, they get suckered into spin-offs and launching other shows or movies and instead of one good show, you get two weak ones.Maintaining the quality of a primetime series is a backbreaking job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But doing it for two shows?That's pretty much impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really don't understand why anyone would even try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You becomericher than God if you create a hit primetime show like Grey's Anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when it's reached the end and you want to make something new, people will line up to do business with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So whyspoil your baby with a bunch of new projects? It's almost worse than what David Milch did whenhe dumped Deadwood to make the horrible John From Cincinnatti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, at least he just stopped Deadwood rather than let it become a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Battlestar: Galactica was easily one of the best shows on TV, getting better year after year -- until season three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guess what was occupyingtheir minds? A spin-off set in the past called Caprica that will in fact begin after this show is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CSI: Miami Sixth Season ($79.99; Paramount) is one of the most popular shows in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But is there anyone who thinks that the unique blockbuster success of the original CSI hasn't been diluted by two indistinguishable spin-offs? I mean, how many blood splatters and hair fibres canyou analyze, anyway? If The Wire had a fifth and final season that wasn't quite the equal of the brilliant fourth, you might look at the energy its creators put into launching Generation Kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV is littered with countless other examples of people dropping the ball on a great show because they gotdistracted by the lure of spin-offs and other projects that could give them a media empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And farrarer is the example of a show like Cheers : a massive hit whose creative team stayed with it to the end and then -- and only then -- launched a spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it any suprise that Frasier is arguably the Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

So tell me, any recent TV shows break your heart by falling apart in quality? Also out this week: Cult Classic -- The reputation of The Big Lebowski ($19.98; Focus) and the iconic status of the Dude continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has it really only been ten years since this Coen Brothers comedy came out? It seems like it's been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For $34.98; hardcore fans can get a copy of the DVDhoused in a plastic bowling ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best Reason To Buy A Plasma TV -- How The West Was Won ($20.98; Warner Bros.) is out in a three disc set fully exploiting its eyeball expanding Cinerama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie's a bit stolid, with John Ford's entry clearly the leader in quality, but it's definitely a spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the bonus docuemntaryon Cinerama is almost as much fun on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seriously, I really need to get a plasma TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comedy's Secret Weapon -- If you read the comedy issue of Rolling Stone currently on newsstands, you'll notice one name popping up a few times: Peter Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He truly was a seminal figure on British comedy on par with Monty Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check out Peter Cook and Dudley Moore: The Best Of...What's Left Of...Not Only...But Also... ($24.98; BBC Video), which offers up highlights from their seminal early sketch series and you'll begin to appreciate his genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once Upon A Time -- Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre ($99.98; Koch) was the best -- okay, the only -- reason to buy Showtime in its early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duvall charmed all her friends into appearing for peanuts and the result was that oft-described phenomenon: a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How else to explaina top actor like Robin Williams playing the Frog Prince or such quirky casting as Klaus Kinski (asthe Beast) and Paul Reubens as Pinocchio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This boxed set contains all 26 episodes and more extrasthan the 2005 set, including the retropsective cast party and Duvall's pitch reel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For fans of JimHenson's The Storyteller and anyone who delights in charming, witty family entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britcoms -- Every Saturday night all across America, PBS stations air a block of British sitcoms and dub them Britcoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My mom never misses it, even if they are all reruns and she's seen them adozen times over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lineup changes from town to town and runs from the sophisticated lunacy ofFawlty Towers to the banality of Are You Being Served? But there's one constant: class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't mean "classy." I mean "class" as in social status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there anywhere in the world more obsessedwith class and social distinctions than England? India has its caste system too, I guess; they're justnot as funny about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two amusing Britcoms embody that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keeping Up Appearances: The FullBouquet ($129.98; BBC Video) has fun with Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced "Bouquet"), who desperately wants to maintain her non-existent high standing in the community but is cursed withlow-class relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find virtually no variation to the formula: Hyacinth wants things to bejust so and her relatives or friends or someone puncture her dreams but she behaves as if she's theQueen of England anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not great, but it's certainly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of a higher class in every wayis To The Manor Born ($79.98; BBC Video), the witty 1979 series in which Audrey fforbes- Hamilton (the great Penelope Keith) must sell her stately home to a...tradesman (a wholesalefoods magnate, actually) and move into the estate's tiny cottage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that this keeps her frominterfering and disapproving at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sparkling dialogue abounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how do they maintainthat class? Three seasons, 20 episodes and then they call it a day. (This set also contains aChristmas special and a 25th anniversary reunion show, radio shows and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more class.) Horror -- Child's Play 20th Birthday Edition ($14.98; MGM) is a suitably playful special edition of the B movie romp that includes audio commentary from actors, writers, producers...and even Chucky himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox Horror Classics Vol 2 ($19.98; Fox) and though it only contains 3 more movies, this set sure ranges far: Chandu The Magician, a serial remake with Bela Lugosi as the villain (he would later play the hero); Vincent Price in the gothic tale Dragonwyck and the offbeat drama Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renault's Secret .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All fairly obscure and hard to find so consider that a comment on Fox's weak bench when it comes to classic horror or a happy example of half-forgotten moviesgetting a new life thanks to being randomly packaged together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you really want a horror film,try Foreign Exchange ($24.98; Screen Media) a would-be high school romp with sex hungry males feasting on the super-hot foreign exchange student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV on DVD -- Ugly Betty Second Season ($59.99; ABC Studios) also lost its way during the show's second season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They let the telenovela take over with wacky storylines and ignored the heart and soul of the show -- Betty (America Ferrera).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More Betty, less bombast!

The Best Of Barney ($19.98; Lionsgate) collects just 60 minutes of highlights from the properly maligned children's show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They describe it as "super-dee-duper"and that about says it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legion of Super Heroes Vol. 3 ($14.98; Warner Bros.) collects just fiveepisodes from the series, which means you'll have to buy five volumes to get all the shows from thefirst two seasons rather than two volumes with each 13 episode season complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm noticing apattern here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a happier note, The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries First Season ($19.98; Warner Bros.) do indeed contain all 13 episodes from the show's first season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it ranin 1995, long past the heyday for these characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas and Friends: The Great Discovery($19.98; Lionsgate) is at least a new feature length film with Pierce Brosnan providing voice-workas the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back to the bad news: The Spectacular Spider-Man: Attack Of The Lizard($19.94; Sony) tries to con people into buying the first three episodes of the new cartoon series.Just wait for the full-season DVD set or you'll feel as much of a chump as Peter Parker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally,Tortoise Vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hare ($19.98; Genius) is a so-so animated film that can't live up to the high Jim Henson standards even though it's released under that banner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it seems like a bad week for kid'sstuff, don't forget that Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre is out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blu-Ray -- Jackie Chan and the not-so-retired Jet Li co-star in The Forbidden Kingdom ($39.99; Lionsgate) is just the sort of action title fans want on Blu-Ray, even if it does cost $5 more than theSpecial Edition DVD and $10 more than the standard DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cool Hand Luke ($28.99; Warner Bros.) is not one of those naturals, but what a terrific movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Newman has rascally charm tospare and maybe knowing a whole bunch of new people are appreciating his work will lift the ailingactor's mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fall ($38.96; Sony) proves director Tarsem is the most original visual stylist to hit Hollywood since Terry Gilliam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smallville Seventh Season ($79.98; Warner Bros.) marks the arrival of Supergirl, which of course means that the show has long ago run its course and theyknow it: the eighth season will probably be its last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This and that -- Jason Statham has probably his biggest success yet (when you look at reviews and box office) with the B movie heist flick The Bank Job ($29.95; Lionsgate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the sort of flick you Netflix or catch on cable and say, "Hey, that wasn't bad!" Reprise ($29.99; Miramax) is more of a genuine find, with two buddies struggling to remain friends (both novelists) as one becomes famous and the other just continues to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin...I mean Tina Fey stars in themediocre comedy Baby Mama ($29.98; Universal) -- but what does she care when she's still got 30 Rock? Heckler ($19.99; Echo Bridge) is a comedy documentary that couldn't be funny if it tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get off the stage! You suck! My dead grandmother is funnier than you! Actually, it's a prettyamusing look at comedians and how they deal with hecklers, featuring everyone from Jamie Kennedy to Bill Maher, Lewis Black and Kathy Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We Are Together ($19.98; Palm) is a documentary about the kids in an orphanage who find consolation and joy by performing in their Agape Choir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look for the heart-tugging feature film any minute now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less sweet is VH1's Last Days Of Left Eye ($19.97; Anchor Bay), which features footage from the last days of TLC singer Lisa Lopez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And dying won't stop her: she's got a new CD out soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, there's The Life and Times of Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfect ($29.95; WWE), which contains a 90 minute documentary on the pro wrestler and 10 complete matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So tell me, any recent TV shows break your heart by falling apart in quality?

JJ Abrams does indeed have a horrible track record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How The West Was Won -- very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe the subtitles read How The West Was Lost for the indigenous Americans already living there when "settlers" showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Trek -- I know people who can chart the rise and fall of the multiple spin-offs by when ST:TNG ended and the best writers migrated to DS9 and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lots of lost opportunities and too many shows at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Jeffersons is definitely one of the most successful spin-offs of all time and I have a personal Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:54 PM on 09/15/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:28 PM on 09/15/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Happened To Grey's Anatomy? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-happened-to-emg_b_126039.html [4/5/2009 1:32:33 PM] weakness/fondness for Marla Gibbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it and Maude and Mike &amp; Gloria and Good Times are a reason All in the Family fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Firefly --A very fun show in its own right, but of course it meant the last two seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (one of my favorite shows of all time) completely sucked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BSG -- If you have a fondness for the original (I didn't) then of course it's wackily different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, Smallville was never great or even good but it was okay for about a season and a half (roughly seasontwo through mid 3) and those days are long gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wire -- The fourth season was so unbelievably brilliant that I don't think the fifth season could do anything but suffer in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Generation Kill didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, the fifth season wasindeed a very solid finale to a great, great series. mredder4 See Profile I'm a Fan of mredder4 permalink JJ Abrams is now the undisputed ruler of Abandonmyhitshowitruinistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He dropped his involvement inAlias, one of the best serialized dramas to come along, as he prepped his new hit, Lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alias soon fellinto a repetitive cycle of wackier and wackier plot twists, which was disappointing on a show that hadpreviously handled such ideas with seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the same thing happened to LOST, as the reinswere handed over to the producing team while JJ Abrams went off to produce and direct MissionImpossible 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lure of the movie business was not to be denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he's back with Fringe, which I expect might have one or two good seasons in it before his involvement drops again (He's reviving the Star Trek movie franchise, after all) and another one of Abrams' television creations dies a slow death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basically, if a show is being produced or written or directed by JJ Abrams, no matter how intriguing the concept (a la Fringe), I refuse to even watch it, because it's only setting myself up for disappointment later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MsLiz See Profile I'm a Fan of MsLiz permalink "How the West Was Won" thrilled me as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music, the raft ride, the thieves in the cave, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I watch it on television occasionally, but itsounds like the modern technology will make it better than the best movie house in town could do in theearly 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's probably politically incorrect now, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess the natives would call it How the West Was Lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shawn828 See Profile I'm a Fan of Shawn828 permalink Star Trek DS9 did the same thing in it's last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Story lines were all over the place for half of it,then when it finally got focused it missed some great opportunities for new direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They never reallyexploited Cisco's position as a religious figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were a number of directions to go with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another was the show "Girlfriends", which seemed to lose direction after the departure of Jill Marie Jones as the writers sought to produce a new chemistry rather than have it thought out in advance.Sloppy righting and story lines lost audience. magawiscas See Profile I'm a Fan of magawiscas permalink 2nd best spinoff--The Jeffersons! LiberalBuzz See Profile I'm a Fan of LiberalBuzz permalink It's hard for me to find shows that lost there mojo since most of the ones I like get canceled firstseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FIREFLY is the most egregious of those I felt were top quality and never made it while realitycrud gets the pass all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUTLOST lost it's quality and when the producers and writers admitted they were making it up WHILE the show was being filmed, well that shows they really had no idea of what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drop in ratings was very good proof of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:27 PM on 09/15/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:00 PM on 09/15/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:35 AM on 09/14/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:15 PM on 09/13/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:17 AM on 09/13/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Happened To Grey's Anatomy? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-happened-to-emg_b_126039.html [4/5/2009 1:32:33 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry I realize this goes against the grain ( and I hope you don't think lesser of me for it) but I hate Battlestar Craptica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It personified the words....Space Opera to a "T".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It SHOULD have been called something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had nothing in common with the original BSG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was jazzed when they announced it's return even if Ronald (The Cooler) Moore was at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The showwas so easy to pick apart that is was like watching Dick Cheney "hunt" birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smallville? Was it ever great? It was watchable and even the arrival of Supergirl didn't make it any worse OR better, just sort of.....eh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baby Mama? AWFUL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Left Eye was sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes the behind the scenes stories are nowhere near what one might imagine a star's life to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cartoons? Sorry but nothing matches the originals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not worth buying the new ones in my purely humble opinon. transistor33 See Profile I'm a Fan of transistor33 permalink Lost teetered on the edge of completely falling apart (or was it just too many obscure references andeaster eggs that distracted them?...), but I guess that's why last season really got me excited about itagain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto on Battlestar Galactica, and I think you could say Weeds may have suffered from the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I have to disagree with you on the Wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fifth season was great, and a fitting end to an ongoingstory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google ER: Seasons 1-10 Free Get the Free ER Collection, Seasons 1-10 on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Details apply www.click-see-save.com Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:54 AM on 09/13/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:04 PM on 09/12/2008</p>
