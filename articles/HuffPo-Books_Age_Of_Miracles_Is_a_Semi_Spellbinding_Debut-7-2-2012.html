Walker spells it out rather convincingly, if in too blunt a manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At first, people are startled but bemused when the days grow longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV stationsdisplay a running ticker showing how many seconds or minutes have been added to a solar day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cults, ofcourse, declare the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then the days get longer and longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extra minutes turn into extra hours and the problems multiply: people begin hoarding, crops wither under too much sunlight, food production becomes an entirely indoor process and families are encouraged to build their own greenhouses a la Victory gardens during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People split into two camps: those who stick with the 24-hour-day no matter how out of whack that makes them with the physical world ("noon" couldoccur in the middle of the night) and those who stick with "real" time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a day lasts 20 hours andnight lasts 20 hours they spend the night sleeping and hibernating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of society sticks to a 24-hour-day and the real timers become pariahs who gather together in communes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Astronauts are trapped in the space station, electricity becomes erratic and then disappears, society spirals downward and does any of this really matter when you're 11 years old and the skateboarding loneryou're desperately enamored with finally starts talking to you? Sure, when he asks you to do somethingthat turns out to be a trip to the beach to look at the beached whales that are dying by the thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butyou take what you can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julia is an appealing figure, trying to navigate the pitfalls of middle school like wanting a training bra when she doesn't need one or suspecting her great dad of cheating on her mom or not knowing how totalk to a boy whose mom is dying of cancer or dealing with her own mom's personal disintegration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ButWalker's prose lets her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, she repeatedly evokes the doom of events in a heavy-handed manner,with lines like, "I gathered up my books and left the house, not knowing then that I would cross thatthreshold only a few more times in my life." A little portentousness goes a long way, but Walker does this again and again, crossing the line from capturing the mind of an adolescent into banality. "This was one of the last real afternoons" and "It was the last time I ever tasted a grape" and phrases like that occurrepeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other times, Walker bluntly tells us what is going on, rather than showing us, the cardinal sin of fiction and one that sci-fi -- with its elaborate premises and thought-out worlds -- is more prone to than most genres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or she becomes so immersed in her ideas that she loses perspective. "Only later would we recognize what seems so obvious in retrospect: this was the first of the solar superstorms, triggered bythe withering of the magnetic field." Why would that be obvious to anyone other than scientists in thatfield or an author researching a book like this? The Age Of Miracles is one of the most hotly touted novels of the summer, but I can't join in the praise, though I look forward to seeing growth in her next effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walker developed an interesting idea and created an arresting heroine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next time, hopefully, she'll rein in the desire to spell out what should beimplied and let the vivid voice of her characters ring out unmuffled.MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Elections 2012 Guatemala Arizona Politics Foreclosure Crisis Hurricane Isaac 2012 Soccer George Zimmerman Latino Politics MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Ray Bradbury's FBI File Unpublished?
