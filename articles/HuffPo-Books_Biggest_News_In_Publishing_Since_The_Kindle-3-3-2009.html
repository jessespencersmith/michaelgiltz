But that's exactly how most publishers treat bookbuyers, even though the internet has made the distribution of ebooks and audiobooks wildly inexpensive for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you like John Grisham? If you want a hardcover of The Associate to put on your shelf and share with your spouse, that's gonna cost you $27.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Want to listen to it on your iPod or in your car? Well, the audio version will cost you $44.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is your mother living with you but has poor eyesight? You can buy a large printversion also for $27.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, but you just bought the Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bet you'd love an electronic version.That would cost $10 for the Kindle version...but it's not available in that format yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Me, I preferreading Grisham in the mass market paperback format (the small, easily portable version sold atairports).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That will be probably $8 or more -- when it comes out in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So just to readthe new John Grisham any way you want, you would pay about $120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, no one is going todo that, but being forced to choose what way you want to read a book is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book world has idiotically followed the disastrous lead of the music industry, which killed the Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Collapsing album sales softened somewhat by the return of singles via iTunes (which record companies fought every step of the way).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, the book industry has decided you HATE to buy cheap paperbacks at $7 and would MUCH RATHER buy $14 paperbacks in the bulkier trade paperback format, which is a lot heavier and harder to carry around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You also have to wait a year or more to do so, even though in other parts of the world the paperback is released the same time as the hardcover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book world has sadly imitated the movie industry by haplessly trying to emulate the DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They thought that meant including an author interview at the end of a paperback as an "exciting" extra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In truth, Nelson is the first publisher to recognize the lesson of DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DVDs succeeded because they offered far superior quality than VHS, provided extras like commentary tracks that were previously impossible and -- this is important -- were the same or cheaper than videotape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, taking advantage of the internet and cheap distribution methods, Nelson has dragged the book world into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buy the right to read a book and they'll give it to you in every format possible -- a print edition, an audio edition and an electronic edition so you can read it when and where you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they did it without raising the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Random House and Ballantine and Simon &amp; Schuster and the rest have a brain in their heads, they'll follow suit immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATE : In related news, Amazon -- the maker of the Kindle -- has wisely agreed to begin selling ebooks for the iPhone and iTouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I'd never read more than a poem or very short story on the iPhone but selling people books any way they want to read them is the right thing to do --and even better if a version for the iPhone were bundled with your hard copy!

I think the NelsonFree edition will be interesting to watch, but I doubt it truly a silver bullet for what ails the publishing industry nor providing consumers what they want. hmmm....I guess I had a lot more to say about this than I thought I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorry for the long post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Actually, the book I'm reading -- Dreadnought -- is a good example of the options that open up with ebooks and bundled multiple formats.No book need ever go out of print with ebooks, so that's great.Dreadnought is available in paperback -- for $21 -- even though it'san 18 year old title. (Somewhat understandable since it's so hefty.) I couldn't find a paperback (though it's available from Amazon) and bought a used hardcover version of it and its sequel for about $15 each, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The publisher got no money for this resale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I might have bought an ebook only just for ease of use at $10 and been thrilled. (No searching around for a title.) But I knew it would be good and if the paperback at $20 ALSO contained the ebook version I might have been tempted to buy that so I could put it on myshelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of a $10 sale they would have made a $21 sale they otherwise would have not.Either way, give readers as many options as possible and you win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Force them to choose andyou lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, I believe the multiple formats should be offered at everystage of a book's life, from hardcover to paperback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hate tradepaperbacks compared to mass market because they're so muchheavier to carry around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I almost never carry around hardcovers forthe same reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there are titles I would love to have on my shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, I'm reading a 1000 page work of nonfiction called Dreadnought by Robert KMassie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's actually difficult to read because it's so heavy and I would LOVE it if the book hadcome with an ebook version I could read on my Kindle, even though I'd still want the hardcover for my shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe some would just want the ebook version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That should come cheaper, perhaps at the $10 compared to the $25 I paid for the hardcover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think offering ebooks and audiobooks for free is a silver bullet but it's long overdue and NOT offering it will just frustrate readers and hurt sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thx for reading and sharing your thoughts!

Ifthe publisher is making money via trade paperback, they would be dumb to cut their own revenuestream. 5. ebook and audio sales are minuscule compared to other ormats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their price point is generallybetween paperback and hardcover and they sell fewer copies than hardcover or paperback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AllNelsonFree is doing is giving away something they make little to no money on in the first place.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NelsonFree isn't "dragging the book world into the 21st century." They are bundling what allpublishers already sell ---giving away the ebook and audio version is a sales gimmick, no different thanbuy one/get two less desirable versions free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An ebook version is not an "extra" included with thehardcover--it's the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, the DVD analogy is false---commentary included in a DVD is anactual extra thing included--it's IN ADDITION to the movie, not a different format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink 5. ebooks are so new I don't think we can talk about a price point yetthough hopefully Amazon will prevail in making $10 a strong figure.Hopefully ebooks of classic titles long out of print will be say $3 or $4.But unabridged audio books are FAR more expensive, thanks to themultiple CDs or cassette tapes they needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With digital versions, this argument collapses and there is no need to charge $40 or $60 or more for a digital audioversion of a book that costs $25 in hardcover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sales are not miniscule: audio books are $1 billion slice of the $20 billion consumer market in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, they would be wise to trade that short term profit for the goal of making buying books more appealing. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, I'd compare the ebook to the digital download of a movie that comes with manyDVDs and allows you to watch it on your laptop or iPhone or whatever without lugging aroundthe physical copy, just like an ebook lets you do with a novel you've just bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelson isn'tdoing what other publishers are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the first to see ebooks and audiobooks as multipleways of consuming a particular title, rather than forcing you to choose one format or chargeyou twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is exactly as if you had to buy a CD for $15 and then buy it again at iTunes if youwanted to play it on your iPod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no particular argument with publishers going from hardcoverto trade over a year or two, just like movies are released in theatersand then three months down the road come out o DVD and then oncable via video on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, that window is collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itused to be six months to a year before a movie came out o VHS or DVD (if at all).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's a matter of weeks and a number of tiny films are being released intheaters day and day with video on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So that's happening more and more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as I said below, they do often release popular books in hardcover and paperback on the same day in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Making people wait a YEAR has always seemed unsmart to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally,many MANY books are no longer available in mass market editions of $6-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now thedominant version for softcover is the trade paperback which is $14-18 or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'veeffectively doubled the cost of paperbacks and wonder why sales are moribund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isespecially annoying when they want you to buy, say, 12 titles in a series like HoratioHornblower, which is 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Cost of production does not go down simply because a book is old---or public domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A series like that has limited appeal and making them cheaper is not going to double their sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It might increase slightly, but probably not enough to justify the printcosts from an economies of scale point of view--which is a business decision, not adisappointed consumer one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can see an argument for an ebook only edition, butthen you'd have to convince a publisher that it's still worth the production cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In light of that, I think your numbers are wrong---according to the AAP website, in 2007, total trade sales were 8.5 billion, audio was only 218 million---and ebooks on67 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiobooks and ebooks combined make up less than 0.5% of tradesales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market just isn't there to sustain the industry with those formats, so I still think the NelsonFree package is just a sales gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If something like the Kindle was going to have the impact of an iPod, it hasn't happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it will eventually, but iPod succeeded because it met a real, existing demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kindle hasn't proved it's such a thing because readers--who have had amply opportunity to buy ebooks prior to Kindle--still aren't buying them in big enough numbers to call it the savior of the industry.

For them, their video sales are maximized because they can benefitfrom the advertising dollars spent on the theater release, plus the first-run periodshrank so video is not undercutting theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director-to-video is the equivalent ofdirect-to-paperback with no hardcover edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Publishers simply do not expend the same marketing dollars per book--or even any dollars on some books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Therefore, two-marketing-budgets for the price of one does not exist for paperback coming out sooner for most books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't forget---the glitzy marketing campaigns you see for books is reserved for a fraction of books sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The simultaneous edition might work for them---and it would be interesting to see if a Stephen King or Danielle Steelesays sure let's try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there is zero marketing budget for most books other thanthe sales force calling on bookstores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes the cost of a trade paperback is double mass market, but I don't think it's true to say the publishers are purposely doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade format is the preferred formatby consumers and absent the trade paperback, consumers do not buy mass marketversions except in genre (sf/fantasy/romance etc.) Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comparison to CD and DVD is I think, fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A CD can beplayed on your home stereo, your car stereo and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You canalso legally make a digital copy and store that on your computer andyour iPod and your phone, giving you the ability to listen to it in manydifferent ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A movie can be watched on the disc or your portable DVD player and many of them now come with a free digital copy you can download to playon your iPhone or laptop without having to lug around the physical DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think that is VERYsimilar to the ability to download an ebook version you can read on your iPhone or Kindle or laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the audio version must be produced, but most of them are very simply done with the author (though the talented readers can make a book very special and some audio booksare elaborate radio plays). markdf See Profile I'm a Fan of markdf permalink While I think the NelsonFree program is interesting (I read the PW article) and am curious howsuccessful it will be, your article presents several misconceptions: Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:48 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:02 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:44 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:41 PM on 03/04/2009Michael Giltz: Books: The Biggest News In Publishing Since The Kindle [Updated] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/books-the-biggest-news-in_b_171482.html [4/5/2009 12:13:22 PM] See Michael Giltz's Profile 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I agree about loving to hold books in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I wouldn't mind with the thousands of dollars I spend on them getting an ebookversion I can put on my Kindle and take to Europe without filling upan extra suitcase and breaking my back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And before the publisherflips out about you giving the audio version to your brother, you could already share that paperback or audio version you bought with anyone you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ease of use will encourage people to buy more books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of stupid restrictions that don't stop the real thieves anyway will just annoy people like you and me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Leach See Profile I'm a Fan of David Leach permalink Here at Thomas Nelson, we think NelsonFree is very cool--and frankly--overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love that it actuallyone-ups all the fuss Roy Blount, Jr. and the Author Guild made about the text-to-speech function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justas you did the math on why NelsonFree works financially for the consumer, I demonstrated whyauthors are better off with a program like NelsonFree financially at my blog yesterdayhttp://consequentialvalue.com/2009/03/03/hit-with-a-blount-instrument/ .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in response to a couple of comments above--1) The libraries ARE working feverishly to developways to add more platforms to their offerings. 2) McKain didn't just sign off on the audio, he did ithimself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:41 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:20 AM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:44 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:02 AM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:45 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:51 AM on 03/04/2009Michael Giltz: Books: The Biggest News In Publishing Since The Kindle [Updated] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/books-the-biggest-news-in_b_171482.html [4/5/2009 12:13:22 PM] See Michael Giltz's Profile See Michael Giltz's Profile Thanks for the link and the info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wonder, do you have plans to bundle the multiple formats for titles when they come out inpaperback as well? David Leach See Profile I'm a Fan of David Leach permalink Right now, our plan is to roll out all business books with the NelsonFree features,regardless of binding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No plans at the moment to go backwards into the backlist, butcurrent hardcovers that go to paperback will be NelsonFree...or at least that's myunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JamezQ See Profile I'm a Fan of JamezQ permalink I'm not buying any books or music that wont come downloadable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If its not available for my Kindle or myIpod I wont buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't have room in my apartment for books or CDs but I have plenty of space on my Kindle and Ipod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MagisterLudi See Profile I'm a Fan of MagisterLudi permalink You mean you only read downloadable books and nothing else?

Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink JamezQ, I know many people like you, especially when it comes to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine not having the actualphysical CD or book in my reach, but others don't care.IGiven the highly limited number of titles available (it'ssomething like 250,000 but that many titles get released every two years), I also can't imagine limiting myself to ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not a JohnGrisham fan but his latest title for example is not available on the Kindle.MagisterLudi makes some valid points but I don't think it's too pie in the sky to seecopyrights and intellectual property as having a sea change in the next 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Google's book imaging project and ebooks proliferating why wouldn't every single public domain title be available free just like you can get text versions online?I think because of digital ease of access, that 50 years from now just abouteverything from movies to TV shows to books to albums will just be out there, justlike they're in your local library and everyone will have access to everything,certainly everything made 30 years ago and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's gonna be great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't knowhow writers like me will make money, but it's coming MasterLuigi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taurus See Profile I'm a Fan of Taurus permalink I hate mass market paperbacks: the print is too small, the bindings don't last, the package itself is toosmall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trade paperbacks are easier to slip into luggage because they're flatter, usually have largerprint, and are simply more comfortable to hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that all may be why mass market paperback salesare way down. justmeinAz See Profile I'm a Fan of justmeinAz permalink I have the same preference, and for the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm quite curious about the Kindle, butfrankly, as long as Amazon won't budge on the price, I'm sticking with print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:46 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:15 AM on 03/05/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:12 AM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:01 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:51 PM on 03/04/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:58 AM on 03/04/2009Michael Giltz: Books: The Biggest News In Publishing Since The Kindle [Updated] http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/books-the-biggest-news-in_b_171482.html [4/5/2009 12:13:22 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type See Michael Giltz's Profile Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Hey guys, thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you prefer trade paperbacks, great! I'm glad you have the option to buy it inthat format and annoyed that I DON"T have the option tobuy the same title in mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You wanna pay $15 forthe same book in trade that I can get for $7 in mass market, cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I understand why it's appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They last longer and are def sturdier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But mas market sales are down because very few bestsellers are released in that format anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JustmeinAz, I agree that the Kindle is pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure it'll come down to below $200, though I think $150 might be the sweet spot for mass consumption.And I HOPE they make ebooks they sell available to every ebook out there, which isexactly what seems to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 pages total) You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Download A Free Audiobook Choose from over 60,000 titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listen on your iPod or MP3 player!
