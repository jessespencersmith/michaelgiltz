(I couldn't find an English language trailer but you'll be able to follow this teaser.)

READ MORE Clooney's Girl, ElisabettaCanalis: 'I Will Be Married' Michel Petrucciani was a gifted jazz pianist who also dealt with dwarfism and bones so fragile he would sometimes break his collarbone and fingers and the like while performing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To its credit, this valentine tothe artist is not a triumphant tale of overcoming adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, it's just the story of a complicated,Falstaffian talent who embraced life as often as men and women embraced him to carry the pianist onstage for his concerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This documentary by Michael Radford makes extensive use of the many interviewsPetrucciani granted over the years as well as talking with his family, friends and fellow musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without being a destructive figure a la Charlie Parker, Petrucciani certainly dove into life, drinking and drugging and staying up till dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long after everyone else was exhausted, Petrucciani was ready for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just knew he didn't have long for this world (the doctors predicted from the start he would die young) so Petrucciani never wanted to waste a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was a serial romantic, falling in love almost instantly with women who invariably fell in love right back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If one girlfriend refused to go on tour anymore, he'd meet someone within a week and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This happens again and again as we chat withfour women who shared his life one after another, including one who gave birth to what I believe is hisonly son, who has the same handicap as Petrucciani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie is engaging and amusing for quite a while, until it gets bogged down in his personal life, detailing each relationship in unnecessary detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We get glimpses of his craft, but invariably Petrucciani's solos are seen in brief clips or interrupted with voice-overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's easy to see the amazing technical virtuosity he possessed (aided in part by the bones in his hand being lighter than normal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film will engage casual jazz fans but leaves quite a few events unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After praising his talent for most of the movie, it's suddenly implied that he was too imitative of the great Bill Evans but finallydeveloped his own sound and style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What was it? What was the change? Suddenly, he's selling 100,000albums per release rather than 10,000 and playing for the Pope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can't anyone explain in detail this burstof popularity and how Petrucciani finally found his own voice? That's surely more germane than the leapfrom girlfriend number three to girlfriend number four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, you shouldn't have to wait until theclosing credits to finally hear one complete performance from a pianist the film ranks as among the best.This is a heartfelt work certain to garner Petrucciani more fans but it still leaves the uninitiated withmore questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, there's always the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Petrucciani playing "Take The'A' Train," fitting since the film tells us it was seeing Duke Ellington on TV at 4 years of age that made him crazy for the piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ARIRANG no stars out of **** Kim Ki-duk is a Korean filmmaker who turned out a movie a year for more than a decade than hit a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had international festival success, especially with Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hehad a crisis of conscience (perhaps because a woman was almost seriously injured on one of his sets, Ithink) and quit making movies for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He oversaw two assistant directors who made the leap todirector but otherwise felt creatively blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For some reason, he decided to produce this docu-essay drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim sits in a cabin above a small village, with a tent in the middle of the main room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has almost no amenities but he builds an espresso TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 11 One-armed guitarist impresses Bon Jovi Ice Loves Coco Stars Keepit Real Laurence FishburneLeaving CSI MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 Sponsored Links Part-Time Job $89/Hour: No Experience Required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just Home Internet Access!

(Kim doesn't seem to realize that great art may expose flaws but doing so is a sign of strength, not weakness and brings no dishonor to a country willing to face the truth.) He screams and curses at actors who want to play bad guys because being evil is so easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he sings the song "Arirang" over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point, he becomes so moved whilesinging it that he breaks down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At another point, he's moved to tears while watching a scene fromwhat I believe is one of his own movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's surrounded by posters for his films and artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He evenfilms himself watching footage of himself rambling on, which isn't meta but just depressingly dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Themovie ends with a fake murder/suicide and yet another rendition of "Arirang." Calling it indulgent is too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indulgent implies a certain luxurious giving in to desire of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This film is too flat and uninvolving to deserve a term like indulgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indulgence at least takes a little effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JEANE CAPTIVE/THE SILENCE OF JOAN ** 1/2 out of **** I prefer movies of faith to rely on faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When this look at Joan of Arc -- which focuses on the French maid when she has been captured and ransomed to the British for trial and then burning at the stake --lets an air of mystery surround this woman, it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When we must depend on our own faith in the girl(and the quietly impassioned actress Clemence Poesy who plays her) it can be quite effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is she mad,stubborn, vain or genuinely hearing the voice of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The look on her face when she sees the ocean forthe first time makes you wonder; Joan can hear the voice of God in the pounding surf -- shouldn't we? This Joan has nothing but her faith, which in this film wavers at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She attempts to kill herself, begging for mercy as she does so and then refuses to talk to God or anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only the kind ministrations of a doctor brought in to care for her gives Joan new life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then the voices begin again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is anaustere, interesting movie made with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it goes seriously off the rails toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When theocean's roar is silenced and even the British soldiers are struck dumb by this miracle, the only surprise isthat they don't immediately set her free and beg forgiveness themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then even stranger is theappearance of a mystical "traveler" during her trial) played by Mathieu Amalric to vanish out of prisonsand demand everyone repent for how they treat her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Joan's love of God is, I suppose, somehowlinked to the two very minor characters (a beautiful young woman and her lover) that are suddenlynaked and making rapturous love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't think of any other reason why they should appear just as Joanis burnt to a crisp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Philippe Ramos should have dropped the mysticism and the romanticism andstuck with the rapture of Joan's devotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't show faith in your actors to capture the holy, thenyour audiences won't show it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Video Iran Movies 112th Congress Gulf Oil Spill Healthy Living Health News Natural Disasters Anthony Weiner White House Buy a link here www.WallStreetCareerJournal.com New Policy In California Drivers in Alabama may be eligible for $9 per week car insurance!
