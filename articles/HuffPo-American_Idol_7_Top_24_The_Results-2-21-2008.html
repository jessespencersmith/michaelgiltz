People hate feeling duped and when I'm presented a kid as fresh, new talent only to find out they've been hobnobbing with Madonna, for Pete's sake, and were actually signed to her record label, I get annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Practice full disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be strange if someone with loads of talent weren't already singing anywhere and everywhere they could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's a big difference between singing in local community theater and, say, touring with the national production of Rent in a lead role. (Which none of these kids did, as far as I know.) TELL US and tell us right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How hard is it to tell us someone was in a band that opened for Britney Spears (show us a fun photo or footage) and then detail whether they actually released an album, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tell us and let us decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the producers lie to us and pretend these are ids with no past, we get angry. 'Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the banter, they showed a dumb faux video of the kids looking like superstars set to a Daughtrytune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Daughtry's a smart guy to still work withthe show and use that platform to showcase hismusic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He could have been dumb and said "I'm a Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Kudos to him for realizing the show was an excellent launchpad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show then launched into one of their patented, Up With People-style group sing-alongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guys looked snazzy in suits but the gals were dressed in vaguely Sixties outfits so the combo wasbizarre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However when Michael Johns got a moment in the camera, it did make me think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's gotto be a major case of humble pie if not downright humiliating to go from being signed toMadonna's record label and assuming you were on the verge of stardom to auditioning desperatelyfor American Idol alongside tens of thousands of kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly Smithson was working in a tattoo parlor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes people act like contestants who've had prior success are "cheating" or using Idolto steal away a slot from someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The truth is that making it even with a major label behindyou is incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And having to go to Idol after being so close shows a lot ofdetermination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GARRETT HALEY -- then Ryan called over Garrett and dropped the hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garrett was very composed and gracious but I kept wondering, "Where were the teenage girls?" But there are so many cute appealing guys and girls that looks just don't cut it this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMY DAVIS -- She seemed to know it would happen and it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amy Davis was the next to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume it was a mom and grandma or aunt or someone watching her, but it would be fun if it were her lesbian parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've had mixed race parents; isn't it about time for a contestant with two mommies or two dads? Or did I miss that happening already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought it was almost cruel of them to make her sing "Where The Boys Are" again and her vocals certainly didn't convince anyone a tragic mistake had been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end, she rolled her eyes at her own flat notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we saw Paula Abdul's video from the new Randy Jackson album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her vocals sounded so processed it seemed doubtful a single note came through without being pitch-corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Paulahad been approached during the mania of the first season about recording so the question is notabout Paula making a comeback, but simply why did she wait so long? JOANNE BORGELLA -- paired with rocker Amanda and I had no idea which it would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But JoAnne was a pro and composed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also kept her hands in her pocket so there was no warm hugbetween her and Amanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looked great and I was bummed since I thought she would be Top12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still don't know what Simon meant when he said the Burt Bacharach classic "I Say A LitttlePrayer" was a terrible song choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because it's hard to sing would be the only answer I'dunderstand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, her singing didn't make me think, "Tragic error," but I'll miss her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we gotour first shot of crying, thanks to Ramiele Malubay dissolving into tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon all the gals wereweeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COLTON BERRY -- paired with Chikezie and Chikezie certainly seemed to think he was a goner and was super-relieved when Colton got shot down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, I was surprised and certainly it was unfair in the sense that the guy wit by far the worst performance -- Jason Yeager and "MoonRiver" -- got to stay in while the equivalent gay (Amy) got the boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did I think Colton would winit all? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I thought he was good and could go Top 12, just like JoAnne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AndSimon's wrong: if nothing else, Colton would do great in a national tour of Rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure he already knows all the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike the other three, Colton's performance after he got over beingchoked up was credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See you off (if not on) Broadway, Colton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I only picked one out of the four people going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at this stage of the game, so many people could be cut that really all you can wager money on is who deserves to go through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least none of the eight people I predicted were safe got cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it only gets harder from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Were you surprised by who got cut?

I was pretty disappointed, but then you find out someonelike Jason Castro who is truly a fresh face and so the competition should have more folks like Jason.Well, back to the results show, I thought the sing along at the beginning was dreadful, I had to changethe channel...ha..ha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I was sorry to see Joanne go, I thought she had a good chance to go far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theother 3 singers were the correct ones to boot, though they could have thrown in Luke Menard and Jason Yeager and no one would be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were pretty awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!
