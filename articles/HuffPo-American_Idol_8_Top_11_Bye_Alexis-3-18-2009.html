Their voices were massed together in one indiscriminate mix, ruining the only reasonfor the group sing-along: the chance for someone to outshine and outsing the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why would ashow built around live performances do a lip-sync? I assume there was some technical reason orperhaps wanting to downplay the stress on Megan Joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it shouldn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we saw the goodbye dinner held for each contestant going home, which includes the contestants, their families and FOX cameras to record every private moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone shares atestimonial, which must get more awkward as the group narrows down to the final few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In chatting with the contestants, it was clear Michael Sarver was nervous and thought his number might be up. (Don't go online, Michael! No good can come of it for you.) His hand was shaking andhis eyes filled with tears as he described his little daughter asking him, "Why don't you want to bewith me anymore?" Good heavens, if he'd told that story the night before Michael would have been Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Stephen Colbert Rips Apart Glenn Beck: Building His Career On 9/11 (VIDEO) Stephen Colbert rippedapart Fox News host (andNew York...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin Disinvited,Newt Gingrich In For Major GOP Dinner WASHINGTON -- Alaska Gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin is out, and former House Speaker Newt...

Then we finally paired off Alexis and Adam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy threw in a reference to Adam having performed the Jeff Buckley version of "Ring Of Fire," as if that gave it more credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm no Jeff Buckley expert but I don't see it on any official release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it's on a bootleg somewhere? I thought perhaps I misheard and Randy said "Tim Buckley" but I don't see him covering it either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any ideas, anyone? I wouldn't be at all surprised if Jeff HAD covered it and done some sort of Nusrat take on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just can't find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Adam is safe anyway and the bottom three is Alexis and Michael and Allison. (I had Alexis and Michael and Adam with Adam being safe.) Allison is safe so at least I got the bottom two correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ithought Michael's country crowd would have him just be safe enough, but I began to second-guessmyself when reminded country should have been the genre on which Michael should shine thebest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrie Underwood and Randy Travis then came out and sang a duet on "I Told You So," a #1 country hit from his seminal album, Always &amp; Forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In classic country fashion, Carrie wasdressed a bit dorkily, with an ugly black bow in her hair and a black sash with white roses slappedon a lovely red dress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's a lovely young woman and arguably the most successful recordingartist to come out of Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excepting Taylor Swift, she's also the biggest star in country music at themoment and another key reason why Idol has such credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what a great performance: it'salready cruising into the Top 20 on iTunes just hours after the show ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Alexis and Michael face off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges admit they would consider saving one of them and presumably they mean Alexis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And though Michael seems resigned to going home, actually it IS Alexis who got the fewest votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Simon says they will indeed consider saving Alexis and it all comes down to this performance? Huh? Since contestants can't do another song or rework the song that was not good enough, how can they improve it? Plus, isn't the point of the Save to correct a mistake, either one by the contestant (in this case, Alexis, who did a poorly arranged version of "Jolene") or by the audience (which might assume someone is safe and not vote for them even though they liked the performance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In either case, re-doing the performance would be beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result was a very awkward, uncomfortable scene with Alexis almost desperately performing the same weak arrangement with a lot more pleading in her voice with the judges both huddling and talking it over while also pretending to pay attention to the performance that was supposed to decide it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not; the judges are supposed to look beyond a bad performancebecause of general talent OR applaud a good performance that got overlooked by voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the Save is in effect, determine the bottom two and have both of them repeat their performance, which everyone can give their polite undivided attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cut to acommercial while the judges debate whether they'd save either one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEN announce the bottomperson and get the judges ruling, with a quick huddle to confirm their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are you sorry to see Alexis to go or was it the right decision? In my opinion, we should only call it a truly wrong decision if we believe that person was going to make it to the finals. debating whethersomeone should have been sent home fourth or seventh seems silly to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ORIGINAL POST: It was a topsy turvy peformance night on Idol, with Simon looking bored, Paula providing some cogent analysis (again), a minor stumble from Lil Rounds and praise for Anoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show was aratings hit, of course, scoring an 11.9 rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Marc Berman of Mediaweek points out that's a serious 23% drop from last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollywood Reporter gives more info: Idol reached 21.5 million viewers up against serious competition from Dancing With The Stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, its rating was the people like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Touching the Queenwasn't the only...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; April Fools 2009!

-- but in any case, it's not a Garth Brooks tune as such, though Joel took it only to #50 on the pop charts (his last single to chart) while Brooks took it to #1 on the country charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tune has been recorded by many others since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I say all this to try and distract myself from Allen's dimples, but even when I replayed his performance and didn't look at the TV screen (where he was poised on a stool and looked sensitive and very Tiger Beat-ish, it was pretty terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like almost everyone last night, he had a very rough time on the last note, which was the only flaw in otherwise excellent performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Restrained is a word that rarely gets used when it comes to Idol but that's exactly what Allen delivered and it was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another one coming on strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIL ROUNDS -- Sang the Martina McBride gem "Independence Day," which is practically a standard now, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her performance was also restrained but there's no doubting she seemed a little more tamped down -- until she got to the finale and belted out "DAYYYYYYYY!!!!!"with roof rattling force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she looked good and the performance was solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula wisely said Lilshould not have performed two verses in a row, a good comment that Simon -- who seemedespecially bored -- oddly mocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADAM LAMBERT -- Sang Johnny Cash's "Ring Of Fire." Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Idol, the worst sin is to be forgettable and Lambert certainly won't have a problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one will forget his bizarro rendition of this tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could have done without Randy Travis's "I don't even know what to sayabout the boy" comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really? He's been all over the world and is shocked by a dude with blacknail polish? But Lambert's uber dramatic singing was ludicrous, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula made agood allusion to Led Zep's "Kashmir," but that's giving this take too much credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon summed itup nicely by saying, "What the hell was that?" I've never been a big fan of Lambert so maybe hisfans can weigh in, but to me it revealed his gimmicky vocals once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand,when I played it back again, it's clear that Lambert is in control vocally and however odd hischoices, he has the range to sing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume it was too weird for him to be forgotten and get the Video Madonna Celebrity Skin Sports Newspapers Health Rod Blagojevich Real Estate G-20 Summit MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

But instead of feisty Grace, she decided to sing the song as if the woman pleading with Jolene had already given up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parton sounded ready to claw the woman's eyes out anddo whatever she had to to save her marriage; Grace sounded defeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was meandering andweak, a real shame since Grace has been one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges were down on her and worst ofall it was forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DANNY GOKEY -- Sang Carrie Underwood's signature tune "Jesus, Take The Wheel," a big hit with some terrible driving advice for people who skid on ice while in a car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought Gokey was fine on the verses and very good on the chorus, though playing it back a second time he seemed a little less focused and all over the place when wailing away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, strong and the judges loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANOOP DESAI -- Sang Willie Nelson's timeless "You Were Always On My Mind," the biggest pop hit of his career. (It reached #5 and was on the charts for 23 weeks, edging out the execrable "To All The Girls I've Loved Before," which also hit #5 but was only on the charts for 21 weeks.) Anoophad his game face on and -- remarkably -- actually delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy Travis proved his insight byrightly predicting that Anoop's performance would bring about a 180 on people's opinion about hissinging ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon said Anoop deserved to be in there and got a fist pump from Anoop (thecontestants always know that Simon's endorsement is the most important of all).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He really diddeliver his own take on the tune without bastardizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only stumble for Anoop was whenRyan asked him if he was surprised by the praise from the judges and Anoop said no, he alwaysexpects to do great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dude, a simple, "I was thrilled" would have played much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEGAN JOY CORKREY -- Sang Patsy Cline's first pop hit, the #12 tune "Walkin' After Midnight," which was a perfect fit for Megan Joy's quirky, Madeline Peyroux voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, she was waylaid by influenza and even had to go to the hospital, which makes it impossible for meto udge her performance or predict how she'll do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will audiences forgive her vocals and the dorkyhip-shaking? If she's the lowest vote getter, will the judges Save her because of the illness or saythat she probably wouldn't win it all anyway? Hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MATT GIRAUD -- Sang Carrie Underwood's #1 country hit "So Small." He gave, by far, the best performance he's delivered yet and the judges raved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To my count, that means Danny Gokey, Lil Rounds, Allison Iraheta, Kris Allen and -- given the raves generally from the judges -- AdamLambert are all contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottom three: I predict Michael Sarver, Alexis Grace and...Megan Joy? Adam Lambert? Scott MacIntyre? I'm gonna say Adam Lambert (to give him a scare), with Sarver and Grace the bottomtwo and Alexis Grace going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What do you think?

Glad to hear Adam has passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm waitingfor him to give a performance I can cheer on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're right about thefan voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best thing about Idol is that you vote FOR someone you like rather than vote to boot someone off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this stage, all you need is a core fanbase to keep you safe and clearly Adam has that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course I was wrong about Adam being in the bottom three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your finale prediction couldstill come true and would certainly be a fun contrast in styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gosh, I'd forgotten about that GIVE BACK on the knuckles moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not something I wanted to be reminded of :) Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 pages total) You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Michael Johns See Last Night's Idol Performances with the Free Videos Toolbar Videos.alottoolbars.com Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:21 PM on 03/18/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:00 AM on 03/19/2009</p>
