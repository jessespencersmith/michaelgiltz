                <p>E (t) oo N + N c) '= j (t ro oo F q cL' l&lt; Lo 3 6)z.By MICHAEL GILTZ OR Andy Richter - the once and future sidekick of Conan O'Brien - saying yes to rejoining O'Brien when the talk show host takes over the "Tonight" show this fune was almost entirely positive. "The only down side was I felt like I might havE to eat soine crow from some of the more snarky members of the entertainment press," admits the 42-year-old actor and co- median. ':But then I thought, 'Crow cari be prepared in very delicious ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crow burrito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love burritos!"' Though Richter said good- bye to late night nine years ago, he's returned often (in- cluding as a guest on O'Bri- en's final show) and been working steadily with every- thing from voice-work in the "Madagascar" movies tg sit- coms like "Andy Barker, P.I." (overseen by O'Brien) and "Andy Richter Gontrols Ihe Universe," both of which came and went quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Richter, Conan's offer couldn't have come at a better time. "I really do feel like - espe- cially in the last couple of years - that I've been stand- ing in a storm and someone opened a door and said, 'Get out of the rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Come in here with us,"' says Richter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Conan hesitated in asking, it wasn't for lack of desire. "I guess Conan said,'God, I wish,A,ndy would do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you think he would do it? He probably wouldn't come back,"'says Richter. "I guess he bugged every-Andy Richter (left) will rcioln Gonan 0'Brien when he moves into the "Tonight" spot this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richter: Reunion came just in time body and kept going over it for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, finally, feff Ross the [execu- tiveJ producer just got sick of him and said,'Why don't you call him?"' "And that's what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That night he called me at home, and we talked for anhour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I knew what she was going to say, but I said 'Let me talk to my wife.' "I'm just so thrilled to be working with friends and get- ting out ofhaving to sit across the table from idiots," he laughs. "The only person I reallyfeel like I,Bot to worry about talking about whether or not something's funny is Conan O'Brien and I can't think of anybody better to have that conversation with. "He's done a wonderful thing giving me this opportu- nity."</p>
