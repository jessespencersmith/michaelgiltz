Itprovides some comic relief but adds nothing really to a theatrical adaptation that might focus on thedoomed romance at the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That romance is between the impotent, penniless journalist Jake Barnes (Mike Iveson) and the cool, worldly beauty Brett Ashley (Lucy Taylor), who wanders from man to man but always returns for achaste reunion with the one man she can never truly have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iveson handles the herculean task of his roleeasily, but simply doesn't command the stage the way Scott Shepherd did in Gatz .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't help that his character is so passive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the changes in tone are neck-snapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One scene is played for drama, thenext for buffoonish comic effect (our hero slugging back bottles of wine), the next quiet, the next filledwith anachronistic dancing just to liven the mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams as Bill Gorton is terrifically fun and hints at a tone that might have worked: he doesn't satirize the Hemingway prose but mines it for humor and presents the manly, lean prose with a warmappreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vin Knight is good as the genial Count Mippipopolous but on less solid ground with themore satirical hotel owner Montoya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A pity since seeing Jake fall out of favor with Montoya is one of the subtle pleasures of the book; it fails to register here at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some scenes feel like a spoof; others feel like tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does Susie Sokol really have to shove a dildo down her pants to play abullfighter? Is it meant to be humorous or do they fear we won't remember she's playing a boy? Theeffect is juvenile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the show's problem: a refusal to commit to this as tragedy or comedy or some distinctive combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, it feels like a mishmash of styles when Hemingway is anything but.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number ofscenes work wonderfully on their own, like Kate Scelsa's tirade as Frances or the bullfighting scene in which they had the inspired idea to give our hero a microphone so he can deliver his dialogue like the radio play by play it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too much smarts are on display to dismiss this intriguing, frustratingwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But does it satisfy Hemingway or us? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SWEET AND SAD ** out of **** THE PUBLIC THEATERPlaywright Richard Nelson returns to the Apple family, the brothers and sisters (and uncle and lovers) who congregate in Rhinebeck, New York on important occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their first play -- That Hopey ChangeyThing -- took place on the night of the 2010 mid-term elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one took place on the actual date that the play premiered, that is, September 11, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The family is much the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three sisters -- all teachers at one time or another -- gently poke and pry into each other's lives, jealous of any attention paid to the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brother Richard, a lawyer, isfeeling the stress of his new high-paying job after years of public service in the Attorney General's office.And Uncle Benjamin continues to slide quietly and quite pleasantly into a fog of forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One sister has been struck by tragedy, another has just reunited with an actor boyfriend, Richard is losing his vision and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a mere slip of a play, comfortably unassuming when it traffics in sibling gamesmanship but unable to bear the weight of what it's "really" about when the play dives intopolitical hot water, 9-11 and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have deliberately not named the sisters because they are sovaguely similar to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, one has been flattened by pain, another tries to be a little bossy, but theyremain three sisters, three teachers and one would be hard-pressed to tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first play hinted at divisions to come with Richard possibly being groomed as a Republican candidate for higher office (Republican!) and another bravely admitting she didn't even vote in the mid-terms,despite the high stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those early warnings have not borne fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard still softly inserts someprickly opinions but no one has joined the Tea Party or otherwise rocked the boat of this decidedly liberal enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When someone wonders why the government is paying money to the families that lost loved ones on 9-11 (the victims, not the first responders or the volunteers who now suffer ill health for workingon the pile), the audience became quiet and focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is not a show for pushing boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theysimply raise some questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no doubt that the decision is right to these people; their only debate MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?
