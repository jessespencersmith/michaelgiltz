                <p>Newer Post Older PostSUNDAY, MARCH 29, 2015 The IRA Film Awards 40th Anniversary -- Best Of 2014 2014 IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the best films of the year since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officially known as the New York Independent Film Critics Awards but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs, it is more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes, the IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies released in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's their 40th anniversary! The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story lost in the mist of time.) The IRAs has been profiled in The New Yorker so it is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-selling and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics, budding playwrights, plain old film buffs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the year than anyone else but they've been doing it for decades so, hey, it's tradition! And the IRA goes to....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PICTURE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nightcrawler -- 29 pts. (out of a possible 45 pts.) 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foxcatcher -- 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stranger By The Lake -- 17 pts. 4. (tie) Boyhood 16 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ida 16 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: When there's a tie, the number of films tied fill up a corresponding number of slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, two films tied for #4, so that fills up both #4 and #5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If three films were tied for #2, then there would be just one more winner to fill up the #5 slot, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year nine ballots were submitted with a top score for each film of 5 pts, so the maximum any one film could achieve was 45 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DIRECTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dan Gilroy for Nightcrawler -- 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bennett Miller for Foxcatcher -- 22 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pawel Pawlikoska for Ida -- 16 pts. 4. (tie) Alain Guiraudie for Stranger By The Lake -- 15 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Linklater for Boyhood -- 15 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Clearly, the IRA voters are steeped in auteurism, or at least auteurism is so firmly entrenched it influences thinking whether one admits it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five Best Picture winners are exactly matched by the five Best Director nominees and winner, right down to healthy leads for Nightcrawler and Foxcatcher, with a razor thin margin between the bottom three films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, however, it is Ida ahead by one point while Boyhood and Stranger By The Lake are tied for fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTOR Jake Gyllenhall for Nightcrawler by acclamation 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jake Gyllenhaal for Nightcrawler -- 35 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Hardy for The Drop and Locke -- 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oscar Isaac for A Most Violent Year and The Two Faces of January - - 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joaquin Phoenix for The Immigrant and Inherent Vice -- 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Channing Tatum for Foxcatcher -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: If a majority of the voters present at the IRAs (some members vote in absentia via ballot) all nominate the same person or film in a category, that nominee is the winner by acclamation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They garnered a majority of support on the first ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We then go through our ballots to see the other honorees, but the winner is foreordained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with every category, once a winner is announced, there is a vote on whether to rescind. (Perhaps a core group loved one performance (enough to score the most points) but a majority hated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or perhaps a majority want to see the runner-up win instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In cases of a first round winner by acclamation, since a majority of the people already picked it, a vote to rescind has never prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essie Davis for The Babadook -- 24 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmanuelle Seigner for Venus In Fur -- 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion Cotillard for The Immigrant and Two Days, One Night -- 18 pts. 4. (tie) Amy Adams for Big Eyes -- 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lisa Loven Kingsli for Force Majeure -- 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ethan Hawke for Boyhood -- 23 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riz Ahmed for Nightcrawler -- 15 pts. 3. (tie) Patrick d'Assumçao for Stranger By The Lake -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeremy Renner for The Immigrant --12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Ruffalo for Foxcatcher -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agata Kulesza for Ida -- 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renee Russo for Nightcrawler -- 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tilda Swinton for The Grand Budapest Hotel and Snowpiercer -- 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion Bailey for Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner -- 13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bharati Achrekar for The Lunchbox -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Oh the travails of voting on movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard enough to convince people to see the films you loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's even harder to agree on categories: is this performance a lead or a supporting turn? Are there two leads in this film? Are there no leads in that film? Kulesza played the aunt in Ida, a very strong character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly the postulant (the young woman, Ida, raised in a convent who has yet to take her vows) is the lead role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's in virtually every scene and appears from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aunt is the only other conceivable character who could be considered a leading role. (The only other character of any note is the very handsome saxophone player (Dawid Ogrodnik) but he's unquestionably a supporting role.) One could argue -- as some did -- that the aunt is the other main character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, most felt it was supporting and there was just one lead character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion Bailey played the innkeeper that Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner met during the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bharati Achrekar played "Auntie," the upstairs neighbor of our heroine, whose voice was heard throughout as the two women chatted and Auntie shared advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, she was never seen, so this was a vote for an actress who never appeared on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually, voice work is rewarded for an animated film where at least the character appears, even if the actor themself does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, there was strong support for Renee Russo's career-best work in Nightcrawler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Ida, the only film among the major winners that was primarily about women, devoted more screen time and more substance to its women than any of the other nominees and thus won here. (Also, the voters might have sensed this was their best shot at giving an award to a film that would rank among the Top Five favorites in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography yet win none of them.) BEST SCREENPLAY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dan Gilroy for Nightcrawler -- 37 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ritesh Batre for The Lunchbox -- 17 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Max Frye and Dan Futterman for Foxcatcher -- 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alain Guiraudie for Stranger By The Lake --12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Linklater for Boyhood -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Voting begins with Costumes, works its way up to Best Picture and then ends with playful "negative" awards for our least favorite movies and performances of the year (especially those that were over- praised).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So as we worked out way up the categories, this is where it was clear the night would belong to Nightcrawler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its screenplay was the runaway favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Notably, the second most powerful film -- Foxcatcher -- fell to third here, with the charming screenplay for The Lunchbox taking second place. ( The Lunchbox is an epistolary film, about two people who exchange letters placed in a lunchbox passed back and forth throughout the movie.) Since it's dominated by the written word, Screenplay was the best shot at a triumph for this film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, with Foxcatcher and the rest blown away by Dan Gilroy here , it was quickly clear that Nightcrawler was a comer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Elswit for Inherent Vice and Nightcrawler -- 31 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryszard Lenczewski and Lukasz Zal for Ida -- 26 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick Pope for Cuban Fury and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner -- 20 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greig Fraser for The Gambler and Foxcatcher -- 20 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmanuel Lubezki for Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) -- 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Like many awards groups, the IRAs considers a person's entire body of work during the calendar year. (A movie must be commercially released in New York City for one week in order to qualify for the IRAs.) If a majority agrees, one or more movies may be ignored when announcing the nominee or winner (perhaps they loved one of their movies and hated two others, or simply hadn't seen them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, if a person has two really well done films in a year, that can help their chances, hence Robert Elswit's triumph for shooting both the big winner of the evening Nightcrawler as well as Inherent Vice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Realizing Fraser shot both favorite Foxcatcher and The Gambler, a movie much touted by some as worth checking out, was a pleasant surprise for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discovering that Pope had shot the classy, critically acclaimed period piece Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner as well as a forgettable comedy about salsa called Cuban Fury merely amused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This award is strictly for Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner but it's instructive to see how a great talent like Pope can also work on dreck; hey, you gotta pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was followed by a discussion of which if any tech workers like production designers, costumers and the notoriously prolific film composers may be more discerning when it comes to what movies to work on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a film released in 2014 is not mentioned under an artist's nomination or win, it has been ignored by consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Birdman, Michael was schooled on the difference between cinematography and the general choices of the director and the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some (Michael and others) felt the faux tracking shot used throughout the entire film was in fact a distracting and pointless stunt in a bad film, others contended that whatever one felt about the movie, as a technical challenge lighting and shooting the many long tracking shots that were strung together was an impressive achievement for Lubezki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, everyone hated the moment where we saw a drummer in a hallway playing the film's score at that moment and we name-checked the many times this conceit had been used before and better, such as Top Secret! BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suzie Davies for Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turner -- 23 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jess Gonchor for Foxcatcher -- 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rick Heinrichs for Big Eyes -- 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kevin Kavanaugh for Nightcrawler -- 13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Josefin Åsberg for Force Majeure -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCORE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mica Levi for Under The Skin -- 21 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Newton Howard for Nightcrawler -- 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for Gone Girl -- 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny Elfman for Big Eyes-- 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexandre Desplat for The Grand Budapest Hotel --9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Like I said, composers are the trollops of the film world: they never say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'll quite often create scores for two or three or four movies released in one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Film scores are hugely important, yet they're often the last element added to a movie, in a rush, at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go figure. (No one ever said Hollywood was smart.) Alexandre Desplat also did the score for The Imitation Game which had exactly one vociferous supporter among the IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It proved the most hated film of the year among IRA voters and thus his work is not acknowledged here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Newton Howard also did the score for Maleficent, a big Hollywood film that the few members who saw enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST EDITING 1. (tie) Jay Cassidy, Stuart Levy and Conor O'Neill for Foxcatcher -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon Njoo for The Babadook -- 12 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean Christophe Hym for Stranger By The Lake -- 11 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandra Adair for Boyhood -- 9 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justine Wright for Locke -- 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST COSTUME 1.
