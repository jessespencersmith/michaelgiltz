                <p>Books: My Favorite Books of 2013Revealed! #LastMinuteGifts No one person can create a best of the year list covering books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe one type of book, like mystery or sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But so many hundreds of thousands of books come out thatcovering all of them is nigh on impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So keeping in mind that there are many greattitles I wanted to read but haven't tackled yet, here is a list of my favorites from the booksI read in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather than breaking them down in fiction and nonfiction, kids and sci-fiand so on, I'll just present them essentially in the order I read them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're looking for agift or something great to read and you enjoy the genre, give it a shot! JUNIUS AND ALBERT'S ADVENTURES IN THECONFEDERACY By Peter Carlson$26.99; PublicAffairs Here's a great example of a fun book falling through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This nonfiction romp tells the true-life story of two Northern journalists -- knights of the quill, as they and their friends jokingly dubthemselves -- who head off to cover the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After many(mis)adventures, they are captured and imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drawn from the exploits they published, letters and other documents, this book details their hijinks and the remarkable tale of their escape and journey back to safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a funny, fascinating look that reveals the varied points of view that colored the war (sympathetic Southerners,indifferent Northerners, patriots risking their lives, men hoping just to survive and on andon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder the two men became wildly famous in their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I await the film versionstarring Tobey Maguire (at least that's who I would cast) with anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A prisonescape classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRANSATLANTIC By Colum McCann $27; Random House Colum McCann had a dreadful task: to follow up the universal acclaim of Let The Great World Spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He accomplished it with ease in this elegant novel that tracks the lives of people flitting back andforth from the US to Ireland, ranging from daring aviators in theearly days to journalists (them again!) to freed slave FrederickDouglass on a lecture tour and even Senator George Mitchell on his quixotic mission to bring peace to that nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCann ties these various strands togetherwith a light touch and the novel as a whole simple glides by with pleasure and insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ofcourse, now McCann has an even harder task: to follow both these modern gems with yetanother one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GREAT NORTH ROADBy Peter F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton$30; Del Rey This sci-fi mystery novel is ideal for fans of both genres and may well lure reluctant mystery buffs to explore sci-fi or send sci-fi buffsMay 16, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 12/24/2013 1:17 amtoward some great detective novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this thriller set one hundred years in the future, a detective must investigate the death of amember of the North family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Problem number one: They're the mostpowerful family in the world(s) and not terribly cooperative; they want the crime solved but with minimal fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any unpleasant details may get swept underthe rug along with the detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Problem number two: They're clones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the wealthyNorth family has had the rare funds available to clone themselves for generations, whichmakes even telling them apart damn hard, not to mention parsing out motives and whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in a woman wrongly convicted of murdering a North years ago, signs of alien life on a colony world and enough nifty ideas for futuristic police work to make yourhead spin and you've got a doozy of a story that handles both genres with satisfyingresults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A DUAL INHERITANCE By Joanna Hershon$26; Ballantine Here's another gem that seemed to get lost in the shuffle this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hershon tells a deceptively familiar tale about two young men fromwildly different backgrounds who become friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugh is aKennedy-esque child of privilege; Ed is a rough and tumble kiddesperate to make a buck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They join up in college and while theysoon drift apart, their lives are forever linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These men are fascinating but the women in their lives are equally compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Hershon cleverlyshows the children of one guy seeming to inherit traits from his one-time friend with thesame happening to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a subtle, fascinating way to show ideas and rebellionsand strains hidden in our character that come to life in our kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most of all it's simply a compelling story about lives stretching from the early 1960s to the stock market collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LITTLE GREENBy Walter Mosley$26.95; Doubleday First Mosley brought Mouse seemingly back from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he's done the same for Easy Rawlins in Little Green, the latest in his wildly entertaining and insightful depictions of both one man and a city over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Race always dominates in subtle, engaging fashion -- Easy Rawlins' place in the world, his desire to push upagainst boundaries and yet to recognize them when others would play dumb is the undercurrent throughout these novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mosley is never didactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theworld he brings to life is real enough to burn and that it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here it's 1967 and Mr.Rawlins is asked to track down a young man in 1967 LA who has disappeared during anacid trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is more; there is always more and Mosley does not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like SirArthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, Mosley might as well just accept that Rawlinsand Mouse are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUEEN OF THE AIRBy Dean N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jensen $26; Crown My favorite biography of the year, this is one of those true-life tales so over the top it makes fiction pale in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little girl rises from near poverty to become Leitzel, the most famous star of thecircus back in the era when that meant being one of the mostfamous stars in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little boy who is besotted with her determines to become worthy of her love and devotes himself to mastering the mostdangerous, death-defying stunt on the trapeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Years later, he does so, wins worldwidefame and her heart (for a time; she's rather fickle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is just the beginning of a tale withups and downs and the glamour of the circus and the pain of broken hearts andindifferent homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The coincidences, the celebrities, and the calamity of the Depressionresult in one of the most jaw-dropping and entertaining lives you'll read about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'mconvinced the ugly cover is what kept this one from breaking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't miss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LOWLAND By Jhumpa Lahiri $27.95; Knopf Lahiri's boldest and most ambitious work yet, The Lowland is a thoroughly satisfying novel with a broad sweep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It follows two brothers throughout their lives and it's a credit to the book that nomatter which brother we're reading about or which era (Calcutta inthe 1960s to America in the decades that follow), we are caught up in the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One brother becomes a radical devoted to revolution; the other becomes ascientist doing quiet research in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The woman that links them both is even morefascinating and here Lahiri pulls off a real triumph by making a mother who leaves her child behind empathetic and understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This didn't seem to have quite the pull for readers of some of her earlier work, but they're missing a nuanced, mature effort thatbodes well for the future of this acclaimed author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE UNWINDING By George Packer$27; Farrar, Straus and Giroux Packer's magisterial work looks at life in the United States during the "unwinding," that era of the past few decades when the American dream began to tarnish; when the promise that if you worked hard you'd get ahead and your kids would have a chance todo even better than you was broken; when absolutely nothing seemed to work for the worker, the small businessman, the idealist or the dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hetells this story by focusing on people who represent a wide swath of America, from SiliconValley entrepreneurs to factory workers, from innovators in green technology to anevangelist for God and an evangelist for whomever is hiring (also known as a lobbyist).Packer brings to life liberals and conservatives, the heartland and the coast and again andagain he finds people who've been knocked silly by the changing times and aren't sure ifthey'll be able to pick themselves up, much less dust themselves off and start all overagain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As much as any work I've read, this book illuminates what's been going on behind the headlines of real estate busts and tech booms and jobs going overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essential and gripping.WINGER By Andrew Smith$16.99; Simon &amp; Schuster I hate, hate, hate the ending of this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's too intriguing and fresh before that for me to dismiss it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith has a freshvoice and ably captures the spirit of Ryan, a small-ish but tough asnails 14 year old who lives and breathes rugby when he's notpatiently waiting for his best friend Annie to stop thinking of him asa little kid and let him kiss her already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boarding school, gay pal, unrequited (or is that requited?) crush -- it's familiar territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Smith has a clever wayof breaking up the text in believable bursts of graphic novel silliness or lists written by ourhero that are very funny and convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus it's hard to imagine any kid not wanting to sign up for rugby once you get immersed in its crazy, self-glorifying traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad Smith seemed to pull the finale straight out of those "problem" young adult novels of the1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still it has the coolest cover of the year and Smith is one to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BLOOD OF TYRANTSBy Naomi Novik$26; Del Rey Novik's clever blending of fantasy and Horatio Hornblower manages to recreate the Napoleonic era -- but an era transmuted by thepresence of talking dragons and all that might mean for warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Herseries started off very imaginatively indeed, with this genre-crossingauthor having as much fun showing the dragons gain a nascentsense of personhood as it does with imagining fascinating ways those creatures might change the balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The series lost its footing in the last book ortwo, I must admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Novik has recovered very well with this rip-roaring eighth entrythat delivers everything this series is best at as she sets up the action for the climacticninth and final book in the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tingle to think of Peter Jackson turning these intomovies (he optioned the books) but boy would it be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can enjoy them rightnow and don't even have to bother with 3-D glasses; just use your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE THAN THISBy Patrick Ness$19.99; Candlewick I was new to the very talented Patrick Ness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I jumped on his haunting, wonderful earlier novel A Monster Calls and that primed me for this new sci-fi-ish adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A teenage boy commits suicidebut then wakes up in an almost abandoned world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did somefreakish accident occur? Is he dead? Is this limbo? Can he returnhome? The boy soon finds other people -- some dangerous, some friendly -- and together with kids just as lost as he they try and figure out what the heck isgoing on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intriguing, sad, and evocative, it may not be the instant classic that is A MonsterCalls, but it's further proof he's one of the strongest authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fresh and imaginative voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOXERS &amp; SAINTS By Gene Luen Yang$34.99; First Second Everyone loved these graphic novels, but let's be clear: Gene Luen Yang's two volume series was conceived this way for a reason.Boxers , the story of a boy caught up in the Boxer Rebellion in China is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saints , the story of a girl who converts to Christianity and is on the wrong side of that rebellion is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's the convergenceof these two stories, the way they play off and inform one another that makes this work as a whole genuinely satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wasn't a huge fan of Yang's visual style at first, but as the novels progressed and I became drawn into the story more andmore, that became less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An ambitious work that accomplishes what it attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICEBy David Finkel$26; Sarah Crichton Books I celebrated July 4th by reading Finkel's previous book The Good Soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My choice seemed a very modest attempt to honor the sacrifice of our troops -- I would try and gain some modicum ofunderstanding about what they go through when sent to war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finkelwas embedded with the men of a battalion during the "surge" inIraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finkel had no agenda and didn't try to paint a picture of the war in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He simply depicted as honestly as possible the conditions these particularmen fought in, the turmoil and moral challenges they faced, the physical and psychicdamage, the triumphs and tragedies and the price paid by their families back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itwas gut-wrenching and I waited weeks before reading Thank You For Your Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This sequel catches up with the people in the first book several years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some are in rehabwhile others struggle with veteran services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marriages are frayed or destroyed or sometimes -- rarely -- strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their bodies are wracked, their lives battered, their worlds both smaller and bigger than when they were in battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The focus is even more ontheir families and it seems like a miracle at the end that any of them are still functioning,given the strain they are put under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll become angry, upset, fearful about the ever-present specter of suicide and genuinely astonished that some of them can even musterthe courage to get up again in the morning and try to make sense of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theburden of tour after tour, the way the job of soldiering falls on an ever-decreasing militaryclass rather than the country as a whole, the impact of what it really means to go to war isall brought fearfully home in easily one of the best books of the year and required readingfor anyone who ever wants to talk blithely about invading this or that country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finkel is indeep now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's almost obliged to return to these people five or ten years from now, whenwe'll be seeing the children of some of these men gearing up and heading off to wars oftheir own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMEONE By Alice McDermott$25; Farrar, Straus and Giroux Well, I'm a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I knew I needed to read Alice McDermott and just hadn't gotten around to it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I finally began with her newest noveland it was so effortless in its brilliance that I immediately went outand bought a handful of McDermott's other works because I realizedI owed it to myself to read them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a deceptively simplestory about a simple life led by Marie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without any stylistic flourishes or bells and whistles, McDermott gives us this woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's not remarkably clever or bold or simple or sad; she's just a woman who has heartbreak and happiness, just like anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what drama in a "normal" life, from the death of parents to thelost sheep of a brother to children, those marvelous creatures that astonish and amazeparents every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might be confused into thinking this novel was a modesteffort, much like Marie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in fact, it's wildly ambitious in capturing a life and doing sowith a transparency and ease that is breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE FANTASTIC FAMILY WHIPPLEBy Matthew Ward$16.99; Razorbill I just liked this silly novel the more I thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first of what is sure to be a series, The Fantastic Family Whipple is about the world-famous Whipples, a family devoted to setting worldrecords in every conceivable category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their one misfit but belovedchild has yet to set a world-record, but everyone is rooting for him, certain he'll do so any day now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, he's a Whipple! Meanwhile they have records to set, competitions to enter, a rival family to grimicingly welcome to the neighborhood, media demands to satisfy and a million and one other things to attendto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's wittily told with inventiveness galore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DARK LIES THE ISLANDBy Kevin Barry$24; Graywolf Press Okay, so I missed Barry's first collection of short stories and didn't quite get around to his debut novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet for some reason, I feltthe pull of this new collection of short stories...and was promptlyblown away by one of the strongest voices I've heard in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone is raving about Tenth Of December by George Saunders (I know! I know! I'll get to it!) but surely Barry's work deserves as much attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved the two little old ladies who prowl tourist sites in hopes of abducting a child from inattentive parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I laughed over the lad who clumsily kisses thegirl but knows it will go nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was thoroughly caught up in the gang of beer fanaticswho go on elaborate day trips to suss out the competition of far-away pubs and haveelaborate ranking systems for the various ales they imbibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ribald, sad, cutting, and real --these stories cover a lot of ground and there's not a weak one in the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT By Drew Daywalt (author) and Oliver Jeffers (Illustrator) $17.99; Philomel If you've ever wanted to create a picture book, you might read The Day The Crayons Quit and just kick yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a clever concept! Why didn't you think of it? Here, a little boy wants to do some coloring but opens up his crayon box to find only a pile of letters from the variouscrayons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're all going on strike for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some feel over-worked, others feelunappreciated (can't Black be used for something other than drawing outlines?) and stillothers are bitter enemies (like Orange and Yellow, who are both convinced that they andthey alone are the proper color of the sun).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letters from the various colors are hilarious and clever and each one leads you to amusingly anticipate the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What willGreen gripe about, you wonder? Perfectly executed with deceptively casual illustrations from Jeffers, this is an instant classic sure to spark the imagination of children and frustrated picture book authors everywhere. (And it's great fun to read aloud.) LONGBOURNBy Jo Baker$25.95; Knopf I don't know why I'm so wary of books that play off the classic works of authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, there are plenty of duds but there are enoughgenuine treats to prove this genre needn't be the purview of theunimaginative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Baker's Longbourn is a very satisfying spin on Jane Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's told from the servants' point of view, but it's far more than an Upstairs/Downstairs bit of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baker takes advantage of our modern times to reference things like a woman's period andgays and the unpleasant sloshings in a chamber pot without ever going modern just toshock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just represents the reality a servant must deal with while their privileged betterscan worry about marriage prospects and which frock to wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly, anyone who has read P&amp;P (especially recently) will appreciate this work even more (the servants rush around doing work when in Austen's novel there is simply the pleasure of a dinner party) and it's amusing to know how exhausted and relieved the help is when the family goes outfor an evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it stands on its own as the story of Sarah, a housemaid who strugglesfor a sense of self, is drawn to the handsome and worldly servant of the Darcy family butfinds true love elsewhere, though not without struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the finale is rather rosy, butthat's an homage to Austen, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A BOY AND A BEAR IN A BOATBy Dave Shelton$6.99 paperback; Yearling Technically, this came out in 2012, but I picked up the paperback almost casually off a table at the Strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I read a few lines and was immediately drawn in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was stocked in the kid's section but this is a boldly imaginative work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some mention Waiting For Godot and no wonder -- it has an existential, fable-like quality that is positivelyhypnotizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't get me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even kids can read the journey of a boy and a bear in a boat with glee over their grudging cooperation, rivalry, head-butting, and coming to terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's almost impossible to describe because the story is bothmore and less than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A boy gets in a boat, the bear steers it away with aplomb andthey're off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But to where? Do they even know? It's witty, amusing, scary and justplain...odd, in the most delicious way possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never stooping to offer lessons oraphorisms or gentle meaning, it simply is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A cult classic if ever there was oneand if you leave it to the kids, why they'll be thrilled, but it deserves a wider audience thanthat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, parents are likely to start reading it with their kids, then finish it in onenight after the tykes are asleep and wonder just what the heck it was about and whetherit's too dangerous or strange for the young-uns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, it's not, though adults might need and love it even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE SON By Phillip Meyer$27.99; Ecco An epic tale of Texas oil and cattle, a family saga that captures a state and a nation, a timespan covering 150 years of Americanhistory? As advertised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Phillip Meyer achieves on every levelwhat he set out to do in this engrossing story of the McCulloughs,the dynasty that makes a fortune in cattle, another fortune in oil andenough enemies to fill up the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sprawling is my idea of fun when it comes to a novel like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But McCullough keeps the narrative taut as hejumps back and forth from young Eli McCullough taken captive and going native withComanches to the tough as nails matriarch holding her own in the man's world of oil.Filled with convincing detail, unexpected twists and quiet moments of power, The Son is an exceptionally smart book that is thoroughly satisfying as a modern, sophisticatedGiant, but also perceptive about this country and the eternal push and pull between the old and the new, the established and the immigrant, the rich and the poor, the pioneerand the businessman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMSTERDAM: A HISTORY OF THE WORLD'S MOSTLIBERAL CITY By Russell Shorto $28.95; Doubleday Finally, this delightfully eccentric history looks at Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For many, the first thing that comes to mind is marijuana, but Shortoably demonstrates how Amsterdam is generally more conservativeand far more influential than the lax drug laws (or rather, laxenforcement of drug laws) imply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amsterdam is truly the birthplace of democracy and specifically the liberalism that is such a feature of the US and New York City in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ranging over centuries, Shorto captures everything from his ownconnection to the city to the excitement of Spinoza's bold thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With vivid tales fromhistory, he shows how and why Amsterdam became such a unique and fertile ground forcapitalism as we know it. (For one thing, it was literally created out of swampland bypounding log after log into the ground until a base was formed that could be built on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Godmade the world but man made Amsterdam and that land built by sweat wasn't alreadycontrolled by a monarchy or other ruling class.) Shorto brings to life everyone from a survivor of the Nazis who played with Anne Frank as a child to truly eccentric characters that prove "crazy" is a virtue in this city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eye-opening and entertaining, it's popular historyof the best sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
