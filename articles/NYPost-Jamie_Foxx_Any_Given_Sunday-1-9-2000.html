"It really is kin!! of separate now, sad to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When there was 'Chico and the Man' and 'The Jefl'ersons' and 'AU in the Family,' everybody could watch those shows together .. "Now, since ·there are ao many networks and' ao many channels, you're kind of locked into your own kind sometimes, I guess you could say."

(The ating of that charge was removed a bit when the national chapter for the NAACP nominated FOD for Beet Actm in a Sitcom.) He soldiered on, finally ful­ filling a dream of starring in a movie with 1997's "Booty Call" -only to have Bill Coeby caB it an embarrass­ ment that should have never been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foxx answered his critics -sometimes angrily, sometimes adroitly -but always with humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even "Any Given Sunday" had its tempest in a teapot: Foa got a role earmarked for Sean "Puffy" Combs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combs says he dropped out after delays in the shooting schedule conflicted with his recording plans; others say he couldn't cut it as a quar­ terback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Foxx could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fine student in high school, Foxx was also a ster quar­ terback -even though as early as second grade he knew what he really want­ ed to be was a comedian and a ainger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he'. pushing towards the goel line with two more movies due out this year - -Inconvenienced,· a roman­ tic comedy ooetarring Nia Lonjr, and "Bait," a thriller­ chiller !2JM' melt CCHltAr- tfi· ~vi u!0F:z:x atara in of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's defi­ nitely a whole new ball game.
