That's certainly the feeling I got at the performance of the one-man show Helen &amp; Edgar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Edgar Oliver walked out onto the stage and the applause was warmand happy; this was clearly an old friend to most of the people attending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He began and they were immediately caught up, laughing quickly and sharply, knowing his style, his quirks, his obsessions... and loving them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oliver is a mainstay of The Moth , a long-running storytelling showcase that also launched a radio series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This new show focuses on his childhood with Edgar, his sister Helen and their... unconventional mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Make that, nutty as a fruitcake, smothering, needy, obsessive, destructive, frightened and yet somehowmemorably eccentric and delightful, as long as you're hearing about life with her rather than actuallyliving it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are ensconced in Savannah, Georgia, a city that is a trap, their mother warns them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can try to leave Savannah but it won't have it and lures you back in, slowly but surely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They share one bedroom in adilapidated old house, their father long dead of a heart attack (or so they're told).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dark frightensthem all so they sleep together in one upstairs bedroom, each with their own single bed and each bedpointing in its own eccentric direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mother demands constant affirmation from Helen and Edgar, any interloper is the enemy -- family most of all -- and driving here and there to sketch the run-down sections of the city is their main pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Outside contact is thoroughly discouraged, though Helen and Edgar occasionally make forays into the world, perhaps a picnic at the beach with a schoolmate or simply running away late at night, with their mother in hot pursuit, determined to drive the kids and their bicycles off the road rather than let them escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Summers involve a planned trip to the far north reaches of Baltimore, but Mother invariably getsMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Was The Whole Donald Trump Announcement A Gigantic, Pointless Bust?

(The way he pronounces "car" and numerous other words sounds more like Bela Lugosi than anything else I can think to compare it to.)It's hard to know how much of his autobiographical work is embellished but it's very easy to believe that, growing up in Savannah, people would constantly say, "You're not from around here, are you?" and insist he must be from somewhere like Transylvania until eventually he just began agreeing with them that yes, he and his sister were from Transylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume some of the tales (three in the first act and two in the second) have appeared before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oliver's stories here seem ideally suited to the radio or an evening of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can imagine hearing all sorts of tales and having Oliver step in for 15 or 20 minutes, casting his spell and winning the strongest applause of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strung together into an entire evening, however, the stories began to blur a bit.Just as some short story authors are best read in short bursts of one or two tales so you don't diminish their power, Oliver's stories in this evening would undoubtedly be more powerful when not heard all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a sense of conclusion in the final tale, but it's modest and the other works could probably be performed in any order without anyone being the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, as my first exposure to Oliver I enjoyed myself immensely and each tale on its own was certainly vivid and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His talent is unique and clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a clip of Oliver telling another storyabout his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time he and his sister are returning home to bury her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gives you a sense of the spell he can cast though, naturally, it's far more effective in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GRACE * 1/2 out of **** CORT THEATRE I have little to say about Grace because it inspires very little thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is a familiar one in its way, of financial crisis and faith and personal redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever the faults of this production of the play by Craig Wright, they are certainly not found in the fine cast, the striking staging by Beowulf Borittor the direction of Dexter Bullard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all in the text or, more to the point, it's not in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Rudd, appealing as always even when playing a subtly unlikable guy, is a fervent Christian who has moved to Florida to roll the dice on his dream project: a chain of Bible-based motels, complete withPromise Keepers tie-ins, a baptismal pool and so on. "Where would Jesus stay?" is the tacky slogan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hiswife is the sweet and understanding Kate Arrington but it only takes a few short, sharp words to see how Rudd keeps her in her place and has an explosive temper. (Which he always immediately apologizes for.) After a phone call or two, we realize the deal is falling through and that Rudd is on the hook for a lot ofdebt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That does nothing to calm his nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their neighbor is Michael Shannon and, in one of many lengthy monologues, we hear his complicated tale: he's a tech geek of some sort who was married but a horrible car accident left Shannon disfigured and his wife dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We learn that from Ed Asner, the grumpy German pest control guy who keeps roamingtheir apartments and spraying pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has his own convoluted tale about the Holocaust, a storywhich prompts Rudd to his knee-jerk reaction of proselytizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wife's hesitation every time helaunches into his spiel (invariably a poorly judged moment) and her unhappily submissive response to his outbursts set the stage for the obvious: a growing intimacy with the damaged, needy, but essentially kind Allred Goes To Court Over Mitt Romney Divorce Testimony Texas Attorney General Threatens To Arrest U.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elections Observers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Chip Davis Halloween Is a Night Like No Other Tavis Smiley The Top 20 (Cause 10 Ainâ€™t Enough) Reasons (Excuses) Black Folk Will Give if Obama Loses MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Buy a link here Sponsored Links "How Doctors Lose Weight" New York Celebrity Doctor Reveals His #1 Trick To Lose Weight... iConsumerKnowledge.org Endless Enchiladas $8.99 At On The Border Long Island City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limited Time Offer.Get It Now!
