                <p>T H U R S D A Y , J U N E 0 2 , 2 0 0 5Iraqi Insurgency -- Apparently It's Led ByIraqisby Michael in New York on 6/02/2005 09:51:00 AMYesterday, the NY Post ran a story saying that 40% of thesuicide bombers dispatched by Al-Zarqawi were Saudis andonly about 9% were Iraqis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That seemed a pretty remarkableclaim since with most suicide bombings, there isn't enough ofthe attacker left to fill a Mason jar, much less make a positiveID.How'd they determine this? The info came from the SITEInstitute, a post 9-11 org founded to track terrorist networksand featuring an Iraqi-born head named Rita Katz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems tohave done lots of work for the US government -- including withRichard Clarke -- and is quoted widely in the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So how'dthey back it up? Simply by looking at a Martyrs' List posted onthe web by Zarqawi to commemorate killers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An "analysis" wasdone of 107 names listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since that list included theirbackgrounds, the "analysis" involved adding up the ones fromSaudi Arabia, etc.A couple points: the list is hardly comprehensive and surely itoccured to someone at the SITE Institute that Iraqi-bornmartyrs would be far less likely to have their names listed onthe web for all the world to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would invite reprisalsfrom the government, soldiers storming into the homes of theirfamilies, reprisals from Shiite radicals, preemptive arrests ofsiblings to forestall further suicide bombings from a family thatproduced one, job loss for the parents, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So theiranalysis should have said that in a list Zarqawi chose to poston the web, very few listed were Iraqis for obvious reasonssuch as....Instead, expect this misleading bit of info to be repeated by theLimbaughs of the world as proof that the Iraqi insurgency is asham and really just the actions of foreign actions. (Agentsfrom Saudi Arabia, the ally we coddle, one might add.)Don't expect them to acknowledge the LA Times article todaythat acknowledges early suicide bombers came from outsideIraq, but that things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suicide bombings --unpopular at first among Iraqis -- have exploded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In otherwords, not many were done before and many of those wereforeigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they're a lot more common and Iraqis areleading the way.In April, there were 69 suicide bombings, more than the entireyear preceding the handover in June 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yesterday, threesuicide bombers killed at least 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The US commander ofmultinational forces admitted that the axiom that all suicidebombers were foreigners may not be the case.But others refuse to see this."There is no evidence this is being done by Iraqis," saidU.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maj.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John DeFreitas III, intelligence chief for themultinational mission that has about 150,000 troops inIraq.
