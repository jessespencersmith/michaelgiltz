                <p>More Create Blog Sign In FRIDAY, MAY 04, 2018 THEATER: TENNESSEE WILLIAMS ON SIMMER WITH "SUMMER AND SMOKE" SUMMER AND SMOKE ** 1/2 out of **** CLASSIC STAGE COMPAN Y Right after the towering, never-to-be-repeated success of A Streetcar Named Desire in 1947, playwright Tennessee Williams delivered a prequel of sorts with Summer and Smoke .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It told the story of how a Blanche DuBois character might come to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alma (Marin Ireland) is the daughter of a preacher who yearns for artistic refinement and a superior existence, not to mention thehandsome but callow son of the doctor next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their friendshipremains just that, from a childhood fancy to adult recriminations, with Alma unable to accept anything other than a "spiritual" bond while John (Nathan Darrow) enjoys more earthly pleasures with every otherwoman in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needless to say, when Alma approaches spinsterhoodand is finally ready to savor the sins of the flesh, John has reformedhimself and pairs off with a pretty young thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heartbroken and bitter, Alma tosses herself at the first of what is sure to be a string of traveling salesmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The clanging bell of that streetcar can almost beheard in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Summer And Smoke shows Williams beginning to reshuffle his obsessions -- damaged women, simmering desire, the stultifying mores of a small town and above all self-deception -- to less and less effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The melodrama would be produced fitfully over the years,marking a notable artistic triumph for actress Geraldine Page butnever really finding an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams overhauled it completely in 1962, retitling it with the precious name of The Eccentricities Of A Nightingale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Classic Stage Company and Transport Group have staged this flawedMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ► 2019 (7) ▼ 2018 (34) ► December (7)work with admirable restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anchored by two excellent performances, it avoids the magnolia-scented hysterics Williams can tempt actors with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By underplaying the tragedy, the pain cuts deeper and more realistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you can pinpoint both the symmetrical tidiness of the plotting and the more lurid details of the story, all thanks to the lucid direction of Jack Cummings III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They can't makeSummer And Smoke a successful drama, but they do make this production an interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photo ©2018 by Carol Rosegg Classic Stage Company's space always brings out the best in set designers and that's true here for Dane Laffrey, who offers up a clean, well-lighted space with minimal props like a picture of a statue and ananatomy chart to indicate a park or doctor's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes byKathryn Howe are also on point, not to mention the lighting (R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeeKennedy), sound design (Walter Trarbach, never intrusive) and effective original music by Michael John LaChiusa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a top-notch creative team all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which makes it a shame that lesser roles are handled with less aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I blame the script by Williams and director Cummings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Numerous lurid details litter the story and the less they're emphasizedthe better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alma has a troubled mother and a dour minister father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butin one scene her mother (Barbara Walsh) seems like a woman-child,perhaps the sufferer of a stroke or special needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another, she's a truth-telling harridan, fully in command of her senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So which is it? Walsh and T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryder Smith as the Rev. seem to flounder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The less saidabout the "exotic" lure of a Mexican temptress and her gangster fatherthe better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if those scenes couldn't be trimmed or cut somehow(like Williams I was immediately tempted to fix this show), Cummings might have encouraged a lower key from the actors trapped in those roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, an unnecessary opening scene shows Alma and John aschildren and the show makes the fatal mistake of "playing" them aschildren, complete with exaggerated vocal performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a misstepthat takes a good scene or two for the production to recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, Hannah Elless as Nellie and Tina Johnson (very amusing as a blunt townswoman) are both strong and Jonathan Spivey and► November (4) ► October (6) ► September (1) ▼ May (5) THEATER: BROADWAY BY THE YEAR -- 1956 AND 1975 THEATER: "MY FAIR LADY" SAYS #METOO!

I'd hate to see Summer And Smoke with two lesser actors in these parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I'd hate not to see Ireland in whatever she does next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her Alma is sinking slowly at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The salesman agrees to a trip to thelocal casino (a den of inequity if ever there was one) and Ireland flingsup her arm in a game attempt at high spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it will become sad and sordid all too soon for Alma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Ireland lets you feel the deluded romantic in her is still alive, still open to the possibility of magic, evenin a hotel room, even if for just one night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for a moment, SummerAnd Smoke conjures a little magic too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2018 Homelife/The Zoo Story (at Signature) *** out of **** Escape To Margaritaville ** Broadway By The Year: 1947 and 1966 *** Lobby Hero *** Frozen ** Rocktopia * Angels in America ** 1/2 Mean Girls ** 1/2 The Sting ** Mlima's Tale ** 1/2 Children Of A Lesser God ** 1/2 Sancho: An Act Of Remembrance ** 1/2 The Metromaniacs *** Summer: The Donna Summer Musical * The Seafarer ** Henry V (Public Mobile Unit w Zenzi Williams) * 1/2 Saint Joan ** Travesties *** 1/2 Summer and Smoke ** 1/2 POSTED BY MICHAEL GILTZ AT 6:22 PM NO COMMENTS: Post a Comment Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Newer Post Older Post Home</p>
