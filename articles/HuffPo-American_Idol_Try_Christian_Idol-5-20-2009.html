Try Christian Idol Read More: Adam Lambert , American Idol , American Idol Winner , American Idol Winner 2009 , Christians , Kris Allen , Kris Allen American Idol , Television , Entertainment News SPOILER ALERT: This post reveals the winner of season eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it comes to American Idol, does Jesus take the wheel? I've been supporting Kris Allen for months but it wasn't because he was a Christian. (I didn't know he was a worship leader or has done missionary work in numerous countries around the world.And I'm pretty sure he didn't know I was an altar boy for years and now collect the money when the basket is handed around at my church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.) But for a theory about how Kris pulled an upset over the wildly popular Adam Lambert, the Christian vote is a pretty good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's certainly one factor. (So is talent, Tiger Beat ready looks and viewers who get tired of being told someone is a lock when they haven't even voted yet.) In fact, look at seasons past and where there's a clear Christian vs secular showdown, the Christians have been winning handily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take that, Charles Darwin! Sometimes the survival of the fittest goes tothe person with the best telephone prayer chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check it out. (And please keep in mind I'm nottalking about their personal faith, just our perception of it from what we told on the show at the time they were competing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone I describe as worldly might be exceptionally devout while the contestant prominently sporting a cross might be at the juke joint on Saturday and never evenmake it to church on Sunday.) Season One featured wholesome Kelly Clarkson vs the worldly, media savvy Justin Guarini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clarkson won big time and set the standard for Idols to come.Season Two: Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard both held forth on their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ruben had an edge perhaps from the tight-knit black churches that came out strong for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this was a Christian vs Christian finale so you can't draw any conclusions from this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick RevealTwins' Names READ MORE Gosselins Go Their Separate Ways READ MORE Ellen DeGeneres &amp; Portia De Rossi 'Happily Married WithoutChildren' READ MORE More Celebrity News at People.com Don't Miss HuffPost Bloggers Gavin Newsom The Nation's Most Ambitious Recycling Law T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boone Pickens Propane and the Pickens Plan Popular Stories on HuffPost Johnny Depp As MadHatter, Helena Bonham Carter's RedBIG NEWS : Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8 | Celebrity Skin | Tom Cruise | Celebrity Kids | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Michael Giltz: American Idol? Try Christian Idol http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-try-emc_b_206134.html [6/23/2009 5:46:28 PM] Season Three: trailer park gal Diana Degarmo vs Fantasia, who had all those years of experience singing in church to draw upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fantasia wins it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Four: Good ole country boy Bo Bice (who looks like he might have been smuggling moonshine before getting tapped for the show) vs Carrie Underwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her signature tune? "JesusTake The Wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winner? Duh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Five: Katharine McPhee vs Taylor Hicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This felt like a secular showdown to me: McPhee was a Broadway baby with a dad in the TV industry and Hicks loved the blues/rock circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But is itany coincidence he won thanks to constant shout-outs to the Soul Patrol? Season Six: Blake Lewis vs Jordin Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blake Lewis likes to beatbox and is down the with the latest sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can easily picture him partying down to all hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sparks is an evangelical Christian sporting a purity ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winner? Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Seven: David Cook vs David Archuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook got his start in a Christmas pageant in the second grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta is a Mormon and that actually might have hurt him since there islittle sense of community and indeed a lot of antagonism for Mormonism from other Christiansects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just ask Mitt Romney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winner: David Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season Eight: Adam Lambert vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kris Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lambert has performed in road show productions of secular Broadway musicals like Wicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kris Allen has done missionary work in Burma, Morocco, Mozambique, South Africa, Spain and Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winner? Missionary man Kris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, this is a playful analysis of the people who make it to the finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no one gets to the finals without millions of viewers supporting them week after week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So don't cry foul or horrible prejudice when your favorite gets to be on stage for four months, becomes a household name andgets tens of millions of votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who makes the final 12 has at least an outside chance of stardom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the next time there's an Idol final, I'm not gonna listen to their singing, I'm gonna look into their soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe, just maybe the one that appeals to the heartland more has the better shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Related News On Huffington Post: AT&amp;T May Have Swayed 'Idol' Results AT&amp;T, one of the biggest corporate sponsors of "American Idol," might have influenced the outcome of this year's competition by providingphones for free...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clay Aiken: Adam Lambert Singing "Awful" And "Frightening" NEW YORK — Clay Aiken is no fan of Adam Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "American Idol" also-ran has blasted this season's runner-up on his Web site,mocking...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMERICAN IDOL WINNER CROWNED LOS ANGELES — Kris Allen's smooth vocals and boy-next-door image propelled him to "American Idol" victory Wednesday, turning the theatrical powerhouse Adam Lambert into the...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Idol Finale Ratings: Lowest Results Show Ever "American Idol" averaged almost 29 million total viewers for its two-hour season Finale Wednesday night, enough to easily win Wednesday'sratings — but not enough...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More News Posts: « First Prev 1 2 Next Last » Related Blogs On Huffington Post: Dan Abramson: American Idol Rewarding Mediocrity (Kris Allen Is Lame) If I invited Kris Allen to a dinnerparty, he'd show up and ask if hecan chip in instead of bringing a casserole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kris Allen brings nothing to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz: American Idol - - The Finals: Adam Will Win It All Well, Kris Allen gets to join ClayAiken and David Archuleta as Idolcontestants who never were put into the bottom two but failed to win it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justin Guarini: TheLowdown On Last Night's American Idol Paul Katz: Adam Lambert's "Loss" Due to Homophobia?

And I think Adam was buying into it. spiderbucket I'm a Fan of spiderbucket permalink I'm a Christian but Christian "Rock" sucks just like this show and it's fans - and the peoplewho write about it. bugsbonzai I'm a Fan of bugsbonzai permalink I know this was supposed to be a lighthearted romp, but it still strikes a chord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, your "Christian"links are super weak in most instances, almost fabricated out of thin air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I went to church every Sundayfor 20 years, took summer bible school, went to weekly youth group, and went on numerous outreachprograms that helped the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now that I've come to, as George Carlin calls it, "The Age ofReason",I would be thoroughly secular if I were to sing in a competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldn't call upon that pastbecause it's not representative of who I am in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this year is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it comes to this year, bigotry wins over talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I think if there was uglier bigotry, then Adam Lambert would never have been so popular for months on end, celebrated even afterphotos making it obvious he was gay and getting to the finals withKris and beating out 100,000 other people to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a gay guy,that sounds pretty positive to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tallulah Morehead - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Tallulah Morehead permalink "Season 2: But this was a Christian vs Christian finale so you can't draw any Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:26 AM on 05/23/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:31 PM on 05/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:22 AM on 05/22/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:46 PM on 05/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:34 PM on 05/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:29 PM on 05/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:46 PM on 05/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:49 PM on 05/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:02 PM on 05/21/2009Michael Giltz: American Idol?

NONSENSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone knew Clay was gay just as we all know about Adam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was God VS The Gays that year too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't know that Kris (How ironic is it that the Christian boy mispells his own name, when it's root word is "Christ"?) had done missionary work around that world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That moves him from on my lists from the "Bland, unmemorable" list to the Evil List, as he's not content to merely be insane, he must try tospread his mental illness with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Missionaries are evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's long past time for mankind to outgrow the evil that is "Faith". wietog I'm a Fan of wietog permalink Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faith is insidious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It rejects rational thought, &amp;replaces common sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the one hand, sure, churches are community centers where bakesales for the poor &amp;feel-good sing-a-longs seem to be innocuous &amp;useful to society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, the construct, dogma &amp;judgment are incredibly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We need to separate not only church &amp;state, but religious "philosophy" from community gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Secular community centers need to be supported as well as secular charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Adam - you CANNOT deny his star power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has it ALL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Powerful, unique &amp;professional voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incredible looks - tall, dark, handsome &amp;engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great personality.Fantastic stage presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hardly caught an episode this year, yet could see his star rising easily, as many have.Then there's Kris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BORING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have seen this type of guy everywhere forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, how did he get this far anyway? The truth is that people on the coasts are busier &amp;less prone to voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Younger &amp;older people vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the gay communities didn't band together here as they could have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's probably for the best, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winner is bound by certain contracts and is tied to AI directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Adam will be better off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You are going to see him on Broadway, in Vegas, probably world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a powerhouse.And seriously - can we get over this gay thing yet? Who cares!!! Fans have no better chance to get with a heterosexual star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personal choices are just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good luck to both, but man! chelan I'm a Fan of chelan permalink I like boring its safe we are sick of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't watch the finale but its more than about him being gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There not enough Christians to have voted in Kris so quitblaming them mostly woman vote and they are not attracted to gay men There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All RadicalRuss I'm a Fan of RadicalRuss permalink For Season 2, while both Ruben and Clay had the God card, don't forget that Clay was "teh gay" forthose Christian viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the true theory is the Southern AT&amp;T Text Messaging theory, only with the Christian vote acting as tiebreaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Idol voting, you're allowed to call or text in ten votes per line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, calls get youbusy signals and you have to keep redialing to get just two votes, much less ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Text messaging, though, gets no busy signal and you can send in ten of them in the time it would take to get through one Idol phone call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, understand that anyone can call, but only AT&amp;T subscriberscan text, and AT&amp;T's subscriber base is largest in the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when watching Idol Season 9, ask yourself, "Who would a 13-year-old girl in Mobile vote for?"
