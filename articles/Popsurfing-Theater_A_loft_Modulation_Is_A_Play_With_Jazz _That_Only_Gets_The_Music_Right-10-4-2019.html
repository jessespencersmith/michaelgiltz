                <p>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 04, 2019 THEATER: "A(loft) Modulation" -- A Play With Jazz Only Gets The Music Right (A)LOFT MODULATION * 1/2 out of **** THE A.R.T./ NEW YORK THEATRES When you hear about it, you can't help heading to Sixth Avenue between 28th and 29th Street in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the mid-1950s, acclaimedphotographer W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eugene Smith left a sweet gig at Life magazine, moved into a loft at that address and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One neighbor was a teacher at Julliard whose own loft became a de facto jam session and rehearsal space for a rotating cast of jazz musicians including the great(Thelonius Monk, Charles Mingus, Bill Evans) and the never-was(drummer Ronnie Free).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Painters like Salvador Dali also swung by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Smith documented it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He relentlessly took photographs from 1957-1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course he captured the jazz greats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Smith alsopeeked out his window, meticulously (obsessively?) taking photos ofthe street life below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As if that weren't enough, he wired the wholedamn building for sound, recording everything from the jazz musicians to snatches of conversation to late-night bull sessions about the nature of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result? Some 40,000 images and more than 4,500 hours ofaudio tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When writer Sam Stephenson stumbled on this mother-load, he became just as obsessed as Smith, spending years archiving and organizing all this material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result? A book, a documentary film, aradio series on NPR (what the kids today would think of as a"podcast") and a traveling exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now, unfortunately, a play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jaymes Jorsling saw this ferment of artistic creation and thwarted dreams, this cross-pollination of jazzand photography and art (and literature -- Norman Mailer dropped in,too) and wanted to capture it onstage.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (71) ▼ October (9) THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On Shaky Ground(Photo by Joan Marcus ©2019) It's all there in that photo, which accurately captures the jumble of a set and play that is the fictionalized drama with music (A)loftModulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The photographer -- heavy-handedly called Myth Williams -- is often stage right, looking at the world outside through a camera lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stage left is Steve Samuels, a guy stuck in 2019,unemployed and adrift, hectored by his sensible wife but inexplicablyset afire by the "junk" he's discovered in this tumble-down loft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stevesits there listening to reel after reel of captured conversations and musical performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jazz band swings away in the loft positioned above and behind him while junkies and hookers wander around.Endless talk of Art and Life take place, none of it revealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The modest storylines (the modern tale of a guy finding purpose in life for the first time, a drummer fighting heroin addiction, a prostitutetentatively enjoying the idea her view of the world might have value)never hold your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, you can't help wishing the playwould choose one of them and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly, the sight of a man listening to old audiotapes is inherently undramatic, no matter how often his wife stops to ask exactly what the hell he's doing and why didhe quit his job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But while none of the stories are worth hearing moreabout, it's certainly preferable to the wide-angle approach taken in (A)loft where everything simply happens all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a credit to the rich vein of voyeurism and artistry of The Loft Project that it's proven a source for worthwhile efforts on so manyplatforms from radio to books to a documentary film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps only theimpossibility of getting music clearances has stopped it from producing a boxed set of jazz music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, you can tell any story in any way you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a play seems especially unlikely for this particulartale and that instinctive response is borne out here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jumble of aset, the murky lighting, the stabs at humanity from a cast burdened by clichés, the way the past and present overlap constantly -- it's all in faithful service to the material, but the material is wrong for the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the brief dramatic moments that almost work are undercut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one moment, director Christopher McElroen and his creative teamstrive to capture the way this loft, this world, was awash in creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photographic images overlay the entire stage, flashing by in a blur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The live band onstage wails away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a second, you feel the excitement.But then Myth is shown rushing across the stage with a clothesline,THEATER: "The Glass Menagerie" Sans Tricks Or Trea...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Wrestling With Faith in "Heroes Of The Fo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: A Bright Future In Reach For "Chasing Rai...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: The Not-So "Great Society" THEATER: BOO!
