                <p>For years, the lead singer of the band wasn't;ust in the closel, he was in internationa I pop sta r is rerna rried and staging his musical comebackGarden w theSavage 0N ffiral ;tffin riffierlffi fidl' lmost everyone seems to have known pop star Darren Hayes was gay before he did. "It's weird, because I can say to you that at the age of 11, I was [thinking], Dear God, please don't mahe me gay," says Hayes. "But those words never came out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if they didn't come out of my rnouth, they weren't real." What was real was a lifetime of self- denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes left that scared little boy be- hind, married his best friend, became one half of the massiveh successfirl Australian duo Savage Garden, enjoyed hit records and sold-out shows, and thi:n-and only then-finally admitted that his lifelong at- traction to men and intense crushes actual- lymeant something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes turns 35 on May 8, celebrates the first anniversary of his marriage to anima- tor and director Richard Cullen on June 19, and releases his third solo album, Tftzs Delicate Thing We'ue Made, in August on Powdered Sugar, his own independent record label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 25-track double CD set, inspired in part by Kate Buslfs masterpiece Hounds of Loue, dives into his childhood, teen years, struggles with his sexuality, loneliness,and the joys of making a real relationship work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, lthas dadgy written all over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a relatively mild media profiIe, Savage Garden was once rnore than legit, selling over 23 million albums around the world in the late 1990s, thanks primarily to two monster hits that Hayes affection- ately calls 'kedding songs." "Truly Madly Deeply" and "I Knew I Loved You" spent a combined 247 weeks on the adult contemporary charts. "I Knev/'topped the AC charbs for 17 weeks; each song set a record for its length oftime on the charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chuck Taylor, a senior correspondent for Billboard, and a longtime Hayes sup- porter, says the time is ripe for a comeback. "I think his voice is so recognizable, and those hvo songs. ..for two years they didn't Ieave the airwaves," says Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Carole I{tngls Tapestry and David Gta5/s White La.d.tlcr, This Delicate Thing We'ue Made has the feel of something made for the sheer love of it, without any consid- eration for radio play or fitting into formats or pleasing a major label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the result is music thats stirringly universal and joyftl, even if the memories they stir up for Hayes are sometimes sad."I remember the first person who called me gay in Australia," says Hayes, sitting on a couch in his living room with his dog Waldo at his feet. "I would have been 11 and these h,rro new boys came to school and one of them just didn't like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other kid's name was Steven, and I had a mas- sive crush on him and Steven thought I was the bee's knees, and the other guy just thought, Can't you see he's a faggot? Of course, I had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought everyone wanted to be Wonder Woman." So even though his family wasn't religious, Hayes prayed to God that he wouldn't turn out to be gay and then locked all those thoughts away. "First of all, it took me a long time to even accept that I was gay," says Hayes. "And then it took me a long time to be happy that I was gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were two phases-a whole phase of denial, just thinking, fm sure that euerybody thought Dirk Benedi.ct was attrartiue. 'tsut that was as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I literally filed that into the back of my mind as something you don't talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And because I'm an emotional person and because I'm a romal- tic, I really did fall in love with girls." One girl in particular-Colby Taylor, who became Hayes's wife-circled an ) THE ADVOCATE advocate.com April 24, 2OO7 | qtad for a band looking for a lead singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that led to Daniel Jones, the other principal of Savage Garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cover band they initially pedormed in broke up, leading the two to form their own duo, named a{ter a passage I}om Anne Rice's novel The Vampire Lestat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1997, Hayes married Colby, and Savage Gar- den's first single, "I Want You," hit the charts, becoming the best-selling single in Australia that year and a top 5 U.S. hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was then that Leonie Messer- Hayes's publicist and/or manager for about a decade and still his best foiend- asked the question Hayes had refused to ask himself. "She sat me down in her office and she said, 'Are you gay?' I was like, 'Are you gay? I'r:-r marriedl'She said, 'Are you gay?' I said, 'OK, first of all, I'm offended by that accusation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what makes you say that?' "She said, 'Because every time [a certain employeel walks into the room, you blush.' And I had the most massive crush on this man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was extreme It was so Sybil in that I had literally compartmentalized, my sexuality, all right? My secret feelings for men were in this drawer in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I never shared them with anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Includ- ing myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd never touched a boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd never kissed a boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I d nevet satd. arrything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'rn 23,24 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're successful, number l's in America, and I'm now travel- ing around the world, and these crushes on men are getting more and more intense," says Hayes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel Jones-"one of the straightest guys you'll ever meet," Hayes says-cven opened the door. "I remember Daniel giv- ing me that wonderfirl permission conver- sation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know, 'If you were gay, that would be OIi"' So Hayes told his wife and family he was struggling with this, and they went to a Christian counselor (sessions were free and anon5,'rnous) for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep in mind, this is the same time Savage Garden is in the midst of becoming one of the most suc- cessfi;l bands in the world Finallv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haves took a different step. 'We agreed to separate," he says. "The idea was 'Go to New York and see if you can be gay.' [Colby'sl reasoning at the time was 'I don't think you are, but I love you, and you need to do this.' So it was awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like that moment in a bad rela- tionship mowie where they take a break, and you know breaks always mean the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I think both of us hoped, thought, we'll be together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was justabout to come home when I met someone and I had a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember call- ing her up and saying, 'I think I'm gay.' And that was the end." Or, rather, the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes's first bo5.friend was sweet and beautifirl. 'tsut it was never going to work," Hayes says. "I was ruming away llom Australia, fame, a marriage, all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was beauti fi.rl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was such a caring, sweet, and great way to be gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I sort of had a crash course in it, really." He came out to Jones in 1997 and his other bandmates in 1998. "When I came out, I came out to everybody I knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I re- member running down [the aisle ofl a Boeing 747 telling the whole band, 'Guess what? I'm gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm gay! I'm gay!"' Hayes never worried about being recog- nized when hitting the bars or going out on dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He never got burned publicly, even though he was dating men in New York and later in San Francisco. "I was throwing myself at the wrong men," he says. "I dated a succession of men who were my father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just dated these emotionally abusive, overpowering. gruff rnen who took care of me from a parental sense, in a stern kind of sense, but were not emotional. were never demonstrative." For reasons they rarely discuss, Savage Garden broke up a-fter two albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes's marriage was over, his love life was lack- luster, and his frrst solo album-2002's Spln-made little impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004 he dove into darker waters with The Tension and the Spark, a quiet, sad record that obliquely tackled his stmggles with being gay as well as a childhood over- shadowed by his fathels physical abuse of his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes's brother, Peter, like his father, is still hurt that the singer went public with these revelations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes insists that by this poirt every- one at his record label, Columbia, knew he was gay and it was never a problem. 'You hear these horror stories, but they were actually really beautiful to me," he says. 'TVhen I came out, Donny lthen-label head Don Iennerl just changed ilom shak- ing my hand to kissing me on the cheek when he met me." At the time, Hayes wasn't completely comfortable with being gay, and he was also coming out about his painful child- hood. "I believe Darren had a lot of demons at work," says Billboard's Taylor, "from his childhood all the way through the time he became a public figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thinkcoming out was the least of his concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had to make peace with a lot of issues inside himseif." Yet dealing with his sexuality wasn't about to take a backseat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes was promoting The Tension and the Spark on a TV show in the United Kingdom called Popworld, known for bringing on celebrities and treating them rudely. "It's like Perez Hilton on TV," Hayes explains. "So this guy on camera says, 'So you're obviously gay; why didn't you ever come out?"'Hayes says. "The cameras are rolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just went, 'Oh, you want to talk about my sex life? I'm really happy to talk about my sex life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm more of a top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I really, really like the missionary position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, would you like rne to show you how I fuck?' I was so aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was like Madonna on Dauid Letterman when she was swearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The producers were like, 'Cutl Cut! Cutl' I just sat there really defi- antly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone said, TVe're really, really sorry.' I was icy; I was just icy. 'When the interwiew [was over] I just said to the journalist, who was an openly gay man [cohost Simon Amstell], 'That was really uncool Everybody who knows me knows that I'm gay If,s no secret that I'm gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just don't promote it in my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that was really fucking uncool.' "And I got up and I left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I got into the [car] and I slumped down into my seat and I just.. .broke down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was the moment where I just thorghL, OK, this is a problem now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This has become a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I felt so powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I thought, I haue noth- ing to be ashamed of, It was at that point that I went, I'm going to come out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I need to come out." And Hayes did fually come out officially Iast July, quietly, modestly, on his Web site, telling his fans that he had married his boStrriend oftwo years alter entering a civil partnership, the marriage-like union for gay couples in the United Kingdom. 'We got married in this back garden," says Hayes. "It was a constmction site at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were in a circle holding hands and I was holding Richard's hand and my mom was there and my sister was there and it was so lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't stress how important it is to my view of liking myself to be able to be legitimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can say it's just a bit of paper, but its so much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be able to stand up in Ilont of your community, the people that you respect and love, and become valid in society's eyes, it is like this safety I April 24,2007 aov0cate.c0m THE ADVOCATEnet in your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank God I fell in love with a Brit and I'm in a country where I can be respected " Now his music is poised to receive more respect than ever before too One song on This Delicate Thing We'ue Mad.e has aI- ready been released to clubs under a pseu- donym Hayes has been performing tiny, intimate club dates around the world to reach out to his fan base and sow excite- ment for the new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cullen and oth- ers are working on a dozen or so animated shorts that will serwe as music videos and be spread via the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes will license the music to films and TV and even ads-any way to get the music out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's proud he waited to come out when he was happy about it and not in the midst ofpromoting a book or CD or other project. "In a lot of ways, there was a feeling that I didn't feel authentic," says Hayes. '"There was this adoration that I received, but there was always this trapdoor under- neath it where I would think, Would. these people loue me euen, evet if I was gay? Which is a really horrible thing to think about yourself-to feel that you're fraudu- Ient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though I never lied about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I'm so, so glad that I didn't." Going pubiic with his sexuality when he was "unsuccessful in gay relationships" was admittedly unappealing, says Hayes: "Hey, watch me fail at love! Please docu- ment thisl" Now he's ready to document the happiest stage of his life. 'You know what I'm really proud ofl There's not just sadness lon this album].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's joy, like the song 'Casey,' for exam- ple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's about my sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a line where I say, 'She's coming to get me, she's coming to rescue me.' That was the rela- tionship that I had with her." As for the track "How to Build a Time Machine," Hayes says, "It's just a tool for me to say, if I could go back, I would bring some joy forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I lost a bit of that for a while there in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Richard helped me frnd that again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The idea of waking up and being excited about your day? I haven't felt that for so long "It s as simple as having one part of my life solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this record doesn't work, I will surwive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a life and it's OI( Talking about your childhood and being gay, it s re- ally hard to do ifthe only person you have to console yourselfis yourself."
