                <p>AUGUST 27, 2023 | 9 8 | AUGUST 27, 2023THE TOP 12 NEW CELEBRITY MEMOIRS AND KIDS‚Äô BOOKS T AKE YOU INSIDE THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE ST ARS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BY MICHAEL GIL TZ PHOTO CREDITBarbra Streisand conquered Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she conquered nightclubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she conquered music and then TV and then the movies and then her own fear of live performances and finally romance, thanks to her 25-year marriage with James Brolin .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there any doubt Streisand, 81, will conquer books as well with her hotly antici - pated autobiography? No, there is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her new memoir , which takes its title from her award-winning 1965 album and television special, is expected to set the record straight on her star-studded life, giving her the opportunity to share her own take on her Oscar-winning per - formance in Funny Girl , reveal the stories behind her Grammy-winning songs and recount the ef - fort it took to make Y entl and The Prince of Tides .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEHIND THE SEAMS: MY LIFE IN RHINESTONES BY DOLL Y PARTON WITH HOLL Y GEORGE-WARREN; CURA TED BY REBECCA SEAVER $50; TEN SPEED PRESS (10.17) Dolly Parton dug deep into her catalog of brilliant tunes with the 2020 book Songteller: My Life In Lyrics ($50; Chron - icle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looked at 175 of the best songs from her storied career and shared how she wrote them, where they came from and what they say about her life and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Parton, 77, has dug into her closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Behind The Seams , she shares a look at some of her most iconic outfits and the love of fashion and glitz that became a signature style recognized the world over .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From her personal ward - robe to concert flash and the costumes created for characters she played in hit films, Dolly proves that the expression may be that the clothes make the man‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs women who make the clothes and make a statement with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is another lavish, coffee-table winner .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sky-high heels, famous wigs, bold makeup, eye-catching stage clothes‚Äî Parton shares them all in her new book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think the bunny suit she wore on the cover of Playboy , the gown she wore to sing ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Alive‚Äù at the 1989 Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, and some of her most memorable movie costumes, from Rhinestone to 9 to 5 .‚ÄúI hope that you will enjoy a look at my life in costume and hair and get to know some of the great people who have helped shape my life and my look!‚Äù ‚ÄîDolly Parton continued on page 10PHOTO CREDIT STORIES by the STARS MY NAME IS BARBRA BY BARBRA STREISAND $47; VIKING (11.7) Things took off after Streisand‚Äôs first album (above) debuted in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She became an EGOT winner in 1970 and has won a total of six Emmys, 15 Grammys, two Oscars (for Funny Girl and ‚ÄúEvergreen, ‚Äù the love theme from A Star Is Born ) and has an honorary T ony. ‚ÄúI arrived in Hollywood without having my nose fixed, my teeth capped, or my name changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is very gratifying to me.‚Äù ‚Äï Barbra Streisand British actors tend to be almost embarrassingly versatile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When they‚Äôre not acting on stage or TV or film, they‚Äôre probably doing marvel - ous work on radio, dashing off poetry, directing plays, designing gardens and singing in pubs during off hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So perhaps it‚Äôs no surprise that Patrick Stewart, 83, of Star T rek fame delivers a memoir that even novelist Michael Chabon declares a gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From a rough childhood (including domestic violence) to the haven of acting that became a storied career , Stewart shares it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He‚Äôs won Olivier awards for his stage work, a Grammy award for his voice work and the appreciation of millions for his indelible performances as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the Star T rek shows and movies, as well as Professor Xavier in the X-Men universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his one-man stage show A Christmas Carol , Stewart brought to life an entire Dickensian world, delighting audiences year after year .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he makes a gift of sharing his personal life with similar warmth and skill. ‚ÄúSomeone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I‚Äôd rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on a journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again.‚Äù ‚ÄîPatrick Stewart THICKER THAN WATER: A MEMOIR BY KERRY WASHINGTON $27; LITTLE, BROWN SPARK (9.26) If you only know award-winning star Kerry Washington, 46, as Olivia Pope in Scandal or Broomhilda von Shaft in Django Unchained , this book will give you a more intimate view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mother of three, daughter , wife, artist, advocate and trailblazer chronicles her life‚Äôs journey and reveals the challenges, childhood traumas and extraordinary men - tors that helped her grow her career and discover her true self and a sense of belonging.Leave it to Jeff Daniels to create a new kind of memoir that mixes storytelling, original music and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, he‚Äôs a singer and songwriter , a playwright and an award- winning actor‚Äîand that‚Äôs the short list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 12 episodes of his Alive and Well Enough memoir , which he produced with his musician son Ben, you can listen to Daniels‚Äô distinctive voice tell tales of his star turns in movies ranging from T erms of Endearment to Dumb and Dumber and the Broadway smash T o Kill a Mockingbird .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He shares songs and plays written straight from his Midwestern soul. ‚ÄúOver the course of this episodic excursion, ‚Äù he says in the intro, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to let you peek under my hood; frankly, I want to know what‚Äôs under there too. ‚Äù Don‚Äôt expect Alive and Well Enough to ‚Äúread‚Äù like an audio book. ‚ÄúI structured it like a set list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kinda like a one-man musical with a beginning, middle and end, ‚Äù Daniels, 68, told Parade . ‚ÄúOver the past 25 years, I‚Äôve played almost 600 gigs around the country where I learned how to tell the stories that inspired the autobiographical songs I‚Äôve been writing since the ‚Äò70s. ‚Äù One of the joys of the audio format, Daniels discovered, was that he could tell stories in so many ways. ‚ÄúI recorded my reading of all the roles in selected scenes from some of the 21 plays I‚Äôd written, ‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor the first time in my life, I wrote essays exploring my approach to acting and songwriting. ‚Äù One of the short pieces he wrote specifically for this project is ‚ÄúSnack Time With Harry Dunne, ‚Äù where Dumb and Dumber ‚Äôs Harry Dunne interviews the actor (Daniels) who played him in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That kind of silliness feels right at home next to heartfelt remembrances, insightful lessons learned and soulful songs. ‚ÄúI fell in love with the creative freedom [this format] provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I jumped at the chance to showcase all the things I do, and I had a ball embracing the unpredictability of the narrative, ‚Äù Daniels said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listeners will have a ball too. ‚ÄîAnne Krueger Go to Parade.com/books for more must-reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALIVE AND WELL ENOUGH BY JEFF DANIELS WITH AUDIBLE MEMBERSHIP; AUDIBLE.COM (9.7) Emmy- and Golden Globe-nominat - ed Daniels founded The Purple Rose Theater Company in his hometown of Chelsea, Mich., was nominated for a T ony for playing Atticus Finch in T o Kill a Mockingbird on Broadway, plays in the Ben Daniels Band with his son and won Emmys for Godless and The Newsroom . ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to let you in on what I do, how I do it, why I did it and, in some cases, why I‚Äôll never do it again.‚Äù ‚ÄîJeff Daniels AUGUST 27, 2023 | 1 1 PHOTO CREDIT PHOTO CREDITfrom page 9 continued on page 12 10 | AUGUST 27, 2023MAKING IT SO: A MEMOIR BY PA TRICK STEWART $35;

ILLUSTRA TED BY REN√âE KURILLA $19.99; VIKING BOOKS FOR YOUNG READERS (9.12) The ‚Äúall right, all right, all right‚Äù guy is surprisingly thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his memoir , Greenlights , actor Matthew McConaughey shared stories of a painful childhood, a remarkable acting career (he won a Best Actor Oscar for The Dallas Buyers Club ) and the life lessons he learned on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wanted to encourage adults to catch the ‚Äúgreenlights‚Äù‚Äîand realize the red and yellow lights will eventually turn green too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now in his first picture book, McCo - naughey, 53, seems to be acting on some - thing he told Parade he was focusing on in 2020: ‚ÄúWhat are the things I can hand down to my children that they can carry on after I‚Äôm gone?‚Äù Enter his children‚Äôs book, which encourages kids in the same way his adult book did (he has three of his own kids with wife Camila Alves: Levi 15, Vida, 13 and Livingston, 10). ‚Äú Just Because is a folk song ditty for kids that reminds us that the poetry of life is all about contradictions, our own, and others, ‚Äù McConaughey told Parade . ‚Äú After reading my book, I hope young people will understand that it‚Äôs okay to have dualling feelings, and that two things can be true at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sooner kids realize this, they become less afraid and confused when it happens, and instead, embrace, deal with, and understand it as part of the art of livin‚Äô and their own identity. ‚Äú His gentle aphorisms support whatever a child is going through and however they feel; ‚Äú Just because I‚Äôm shaking/Doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm not steady‚Äù and ‚Äú Just because I‚Äôm sitting still/Doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm not busy‚Äù pair with illustrations by Ren√©e Kurilla showing kids skateboarding, reading late at night under the covers, spinning in circles and other goofy, challenging activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Finally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Billed as ‚Äúa brave and astonish - ingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith and hope, ‚Äù the book is likely to explore Spears‚Äô life as a teen superstar and reveal how‚Äôs she‚Äôs adjusting to life since her famous conservatorship ended. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like defining myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just am.‚Äù ‚ÄîBritney Spears AUGUST 27, 2023 | 1 3 In what she calls an ode to self-love, Jada Pinkett Smith, 51, sets the record straight and finally tells her own story‚Äînot the tales you‚Äôve read in the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her journey covers her rough childhood growing up in Baltimore and being raised by a teen mom, to marrying one of the most famous names in Hollywood, Will Smith, her relationship with T upac, and all the rumors that come from living in the spotlight. ‚Äú Worthy is the story of my life from my youngest memories up until today, and one that allows me to dispel untruths and finally tell the story of my life, ‚Äù Pinkett says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a reminder to everyone that, while their stories maybe different and imperfect, their story is their own and always worthy to share. ‚ÄùWORTHY BY JADA PINKETT SMITH $32 DEY STREET BOOKS (10.17)‚ÄúI hope this book is a reminder to everyone that they are worthy of love, of hope and of the life they always hoped to pursue.‚Äù ‚ÄîJada Pinkett Smith from page 11 Pinkett Smith‚Äôs acting career spans more than three decades, from her role as Lena in the popular ‚Äò90s sitcom A Different World to play - ing Lisa in the 2017 box-office hit Girls T rip .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The Magic School Bus . ‚ÄúGreta and I loved that book when we were kids; it was about going into a world, going into your imagination, ‚Äù Gyl - lenhaal said. ‚ÄúWe wondered, what was that, that sort of space in between?‚Äù That‚Äôs when the co-writers developed their own in-between‚Äîthe ‚Äúsecret society of aunts and uncles. ‚Äù And they tapped into their own families for more inspira - tion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uncle Jake (with his nieces‚Äô permission) named Uncle Mo after Ramona, 10, and a character called Great Aunt Gloria is named for Gloria, 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the book‚Äôs 10-year-old Leo? He‚Äôs named after Gyllenhaal‚Äôs dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even his godmother Jamie Lee Curtis, who is also a book author ( When I Was Little , Mother Nature) , got in on the action. ‚ÄúShe read a very early version of the book and noted it, and it was so, so help - ful, ‚Äù Gyllenhaal said. ‚ÄúI think primarily helpful, like any good artist, in saying, ‚ÄòMove towards what‚Äôs most true. ‚Äô That‚Äôs what she seems to do in her life. ‚Äù ‚ÄîPatti Greco Go to Parade.com/jake-gyllenhaal for a video of the full interview with the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Oscar nominee for Brokeback Mountain and celebrated in a variety of other film and theater productions, Gyllenhaal has been friends with coauthor Greta Caruso , an entrepre - neur and business owner , since they were children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caruso is the daughter of actors David Caruso and Rachel Ticotin. from page 13 PHOTO CREDIT PHOTO CREDIT‚ÄúThere is no shortage of books for kids about their relationships to parents, grandparents, siblings, friends, neighborhood fire trucks, aloof cats and loyal dogs‚Äî but what about aunts and uncles?‚Äù ‚ÄîJake GyllenhaalTALKING TO MY ANGELS BY MELISSA ETHERIDGE $30; HARPER WAVE (9.5) Melissa Etheridge will be baring her soul on Broad - way in a new one-woman show starting in Septem - ber .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, the Gram - my- and Oscar-winning songwriter and rocker has been doing just that all her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From her self-titled de - but album in 1988 to com - ing out and then sharing her story in the 2003 mem - oir The T ruth Is‚Ä¶: My Life In Love and Music , Etheridge, 62, is always honest and open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; T wenty years on, Etheridge has more to say, including about career highs (like that Academy Award), personal lows (romantic breakups) and the tragedy of seeing her son Beckett succumb to opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her raspy, confessional voice embod - ied strength and in T alking T o My Angels , Etheridge reveals how she finds hope even during the darkest times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winkler‚Äôs star roles include ‚ÄúThe Fonz‚Äù (1974-1984), Barry Zuckerman in Ar- rested Development (2003-2019) and Gene Cousineau (2018-2023) in Barry .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEING HENR Y: THE FONZ‚Ä¶ AND BEYOND BY HENRY WINKLER $30; CELADON BOOKS (10.31) Y ou may already have a shelf full of books by Henry Winkler if you‚Äôve got kids or grew up reading his stories about fourth-grader Hank Zipzer , who has undiagnosed dyslexia, just like Winkler did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He and his coauthor Lin Oliver also have a series about Hank in second grade, the Alien Superstar books and a new series just about to launch with Detective Duck: The Case Of The Strange Splash ($14.99; Amulet Books; 10.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winkler , 77, told his own personal story in 1976 just as Happy Days conquered the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he celebrated his love of fly fishing and family with another book in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, with Being Henry: The Fonz‚Ä¶And Beyond , Winkler shares the turmoil and excitement of snagging the role of a lifetime, only to realize you‚Äôve become so identified with one character you may never get a chance to do good work again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As much about kindness and finding happiness despite failure (or success!), Being Henry reveals that being comfortable in his own skin finally allowed Winkler to embody roles success - fully, from Coach Klein in The Waterboy to his Emmy-winning turn as acting teacher Gene Cousineau in HBO‚Äôs Barry .</p>
