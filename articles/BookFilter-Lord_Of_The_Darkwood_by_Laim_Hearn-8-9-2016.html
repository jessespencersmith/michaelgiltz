Call it a Japanese "Game Of Thrones" and you'll get a goodidea of the fun on tap here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While George R.R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin's cycle draws upon the epic fantasy of Tolkein, writer Lian Hearn harkens back to the classical models of Japanese works like "Revenge Of The Soga Brothers" and "The Tale of The Heike." Martin is looser, rawer and more sprawling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearn is more formal and rooted in the ethos of honor familiar to fans ofmovies by Akira Kurosawa and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here's the really good news for "GoT" fans: Hearn has already written acomplete 1000+ page epic, it's been split into four parts and they come out one after another, with the finale Volume 4 out in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, no waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Believe me, once you start you'll be glad you won't have to wait long to reach the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first two books -- "Emperor Of The Eight Islands" and "Autumn Princess, Dragon Child" -- our story begins with a lord who(Lear-like) creates turmoil by splitting apart his family and demanding the eldest son take the wife of the second-born son,sending the latter off to a rival clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's determined the family will survive a coming civil war one way or another so eachson is thus paired with a rival clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needless to say, this proves disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vivid characters come tumbling out, especially our hero Shikanoko, who tumbles from one home to another, first targeted by a jealous uncle, then coming under the sway of a mountain sorcerer, later learning the wily ways of a thief and finally becoming the servant of yetanother master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taking center stage at one point or another are royalty, commoners, men of magic and women of cunning,monkeys, demons, and the young but wise true Emperor, who must go into hiding when a usurper takes the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's tremendous fun, with Hearn taking the point of view of a particular character for each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To her credit, the people who seem like villains (and sometimes truly are), become complex, full-bodied people we have empathy for even when theydo terrible things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know you're in good hands when a chapter begins with a certain character (such as the resourcefulyoung girl Hina or the perenially frustrated second son Masachika) and think, "Oh good!" because you were wondering aboutthem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when the next chapter picks up the tale of someone else, you're eager to hear about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's magic here, from an enchanted mask made from a stag to imp demons who love to fulfill the unspoken dark desires of our hero. (He really should have killed them at birth as the old sorcerer warned, I fear.) This story has the engrossing feel of a Japaneselegend, right down to the tropes -- the rape of a woman by someone she loves, magical reveals that cheat on climaxes andthe like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and still wish for a decent English translation of the novels it was based on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, even most of the classic tales Hearn references in this book are available only in dry academic versions, if at all. (Just as we await a truly thrilling English language translation of the Chinese Monkey King stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oneexception for Japan is the 2012 translation of "The Tale Of The Heike" by Royall Tyler.) With meticulous attention to detailfor the period, along with a bone-deep appreciation of Japanese culture, Hearn's homage to those masterpieces is as closeas we're going to get for the moment and tremendously entertaining in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True it doesn't deepen the complexity of the characters the way, say, "Crouching Tiger" added a moral, modern complexity to the grand entertainment it delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But "The Tale Of Shikanoko" has romance, intrigue, fantasy, passion, betrayal, sacrifice and the old-fashionedpleasure of truly having no idea what will happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of fantasy and mythology shouldn't hesitate...unless they wantto wait till September so they can gobble it up all at once. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
