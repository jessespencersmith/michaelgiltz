That life is moving faster and faster? Clearly playwright Adam Rapp agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He and artist Mike Cavallaro have collaborated on this near-future dystopian nightmare where speed is all and society is super-caffeinated, marketed, analyzed and kept in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even heartbeats are monitored so they don't get unacceptably low and everyone ends their sentences/complete thoughts with "go" so the people they're talking to don't have to waste any time wondering if the person is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go. (They would have used "over" like on walkie talkies, but obviously "go" is one syllableand "over" is two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So "go" wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go.) It's a somewhat familiar complaint with our rebellious teenage heroine Angela barelyShare This Book About The Author Adam Rapp, Mike Cavallaro MoreAdam Rapp is a novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and filmmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rapp is theauthor of several young adult novels,including Missing the Piano, The Buffalo Tree, and 33 Snowfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His first adult novel, The Year of Endless Sorrows, was released inDecember 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rapp directed his first film,Winter … Release Info List Price: $17.99 (Paperback) Published: February 14, 2017 Publisher: First Second Pages: 208 ISBN 10: 1596431091 ISBN 13: 9781596431096able to hide her contempt for how things are. (Her parents must repeatedly urge her not to drop her "go"s.) Toss in a banned book that predicted this Orwellian nightmare and is inspiring a rebellion, link Angela up with those fighters (including another young woman that becomes Angela's first romance) and you've got yourself a story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At first, "Decelerate Blue" seemed a bit rushed to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the single volume one-and-done nature of this tale proves a strength,especially with an ending that is open to interpretation both sad and lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rapp has fun with the dialogue -- societyfrowns on adverbs but the rebels frown on contractions, so in a subtle way they're just as rigid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cavallaro's work moves thestory along though at a few key points I was disoriented as to what exactly was being depicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But their vision unites beautifully with a few splashes of color at that finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To pull a few words from the rebels' tribute to adjectives, "Decelerate Blue" is impious, disorderly, imaginate and irreverent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
