                <p>M O N D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 1 9 , 2 0 0 5Dick Cheney Speaks!by Michael in New York on 9/19/2005 11:15:00 AMI have to comment on a link provided by Joe in DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever sinceKatrina struck, we've been flabbergasted that the MSM hasn'tasked the most obvious, basic questions: why did Bush stay onvacation till Wednesday, why did Rice GO on vacation Tuesdayand finally come back Thursday (only out of embarrassment)and how could Cheney conceivably stay on vacation throughSaturday morning, some FIVE DAYS after the worst naturaldisaster in our nation's history devastated three states? Dothey regret staying on vacation? What exactly were they doingon vacation (shopping for shoes, buying a mansion, etc.) whilethe floodwaters were rising and people were dying? Well,according to an opinion columnist at US News &amp; World Report,one reporter (they don't even say who) finally had the cajonesto ask Cheney.When asked by a reporter why he did not return from hisvacation earlier than last Thursday, three days after thehurricane hit, the vice president replied: "I came backfour days early."Unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think Thursday is even remotely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wedidn't even see Cheney till Sat. morning at a photo op.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With theinternet buzzing that Cheney might be ill (what other possibleexplanation could there have been for his staying on vacation, wethought) and with the relief effort in disarray, they kept his return asecret for two days? Are we to believe he flew back Thursday and hidfrom view? They didn't want America to see them getting back towork?And why do I have to find this out buried in an opinion column in USNews &amp; World Report? Why wasn't this stunningly callous andout-of-touch comment repeated in every major newspaper in thecountry? Why isn't this STILL front page news, with on-the-recordcomments from Cheney and his staff as to exactly what he was doingon those (three or) five days? When did he close the deal on thatmulti-million dollar mansion? Did he go fly fishing? And does heregret his decision? Am I crazy or do these let-them-eat-cakecomments deserve widespread condemnation?
