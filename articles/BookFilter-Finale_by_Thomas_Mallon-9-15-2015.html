[a] gallopingnarrative.”Wall Street Journal“Thomas Mallon has carved an impressive place for himself in the art of ‘historical fiction,’ a genre whose augustforerunners include Tolstoy’s ‘War and Peace’ and Lampedusa’s ‘The Leopard’ . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mallon has cautioned, in theauthor’s note to his earlier novel ‘Dewey Defeats Truman’ (1997): ‘Nouns trump adjectives, and in the phrase“historical fiction” it is important to remember which of the two…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
