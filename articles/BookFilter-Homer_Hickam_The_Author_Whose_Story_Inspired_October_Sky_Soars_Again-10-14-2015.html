(Final galleys actually inspired changes to the film on the set asthey incorporated more and more of the actual memoir the movie was supposedly based on.)Starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal (not to mention Chris Cooper and Laura Dern), the film October Sky wascritically acclaimed and a modest box office success that has become a genuine classic family film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn'texactly the book (How could it be? The book hadn't even been finished when the script was written) but it wasdarn good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But before it came out, the book (which came out as Rocket Boys) was an even bigger hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It enjoyedmassive critical acclaim, sold a ton and has become a staple on reading lists for high schools, colleges, libraries,community read-alongs and book clubs ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hickam published two more memoirs in his Coalwoodtrilogy, both also enjoying strong reviews if not the same eye-popping sales. (And why they haven't beenadapted into movies or a TV show remains a mystery.) You'll even find two competing musical versions of hismemoir in various stages of development.That success allowed Hickam to retire and devote himself to writing, his first passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's published about 18books, everything from nonfiction to young adult novels set on the moon, memoirs like The Coalwood Way,science-based thrillers, archeology themed mysteries and three very good novels about the exploits of heroicCoast Guard veteran Josh Thurlow during World War II.Has any of it hit the heights like Rocket Boys? No, though few books ever do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Hickam says about the unlikelyand spectacular success of that work, he "caught lightning in a bottle." Well, he may have done it again.Carrying Albert Home is a novel, sort of, though it's inspired by his childhood just like his best work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long beforehe was born, his parents took a road trip down to Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was supposed to last weeks but lasted months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thetales would dribble out and get taller and taller every time. "You didn't know your mother was a union12/16/2015BookFilter: Homer Hickam, The Author Whose Story Inspired "October Sky," Soars Again | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=e6a59555-853c-4c1e-b0fd-fc89c7c8049c&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/3organizer?" Homer's dad would ask, and then proceed to spin a yarn about what happened on that trip.If Sonny (as Homer Jr. was called) acted in a school play, his mom might mention she once worked on a Tarzanmovie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when an episode of Davy Crockett played on TV, Elsie also mentioned she knew actor BuddyEbsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was her first romance and maybe her last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was Buddy that gave Elsie Albert the Alligator as awedding gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that road trip during the Great Depression was all about returning Albert to the swamps ofFlorida where he belonged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alligator? "Didn't I ever tell you about Albert?"Now finally, Hickam has taken the genuine stories, the fanciful additions (including rum runners, bank robbers,John Steinbeck AND Ernest Hemingway to name a few) and spun a tale that imagines his parents as young andin love, free for a few weeks from the responsibility of life working at a coal mine and exploring all thepossibilities life has to offer...the possibilities that slip away once children and a job lock you into place.Carrying Albert Home is not simply Hickam returning to the source of his greatest work: it mines the same veinbut hits a new mother lode of humor and poignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also places his parents center stage, a gift almost nochild can manage in their mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I talked with Hickam at his home in Huntsville, Alabama a few weeks before thenovel was set to hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was generous with his time, pleased as punch with a book he believes is hisstrongest since those memoirs and might just take off for the sky the way those rockets did in West Virginia allthose years ago.ON MEETING HARPER LEE AND THE CURSE OF WRITING A CLASSICHere's Hickam talking about meeting Harper Lee briefly when he visited her town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aware of the overwhelmingsuccess of Rocket Boys (and the movie October Sky), Lee warned him about the curse of writing a classic.ON TELLING HIS PARENTS' LOVE STORY AND GIVING HIS DAD A MOMENT IN THE SUNHickam's father shouldered tremendous responsibility when overseeing a coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was pressured on oneside to keep the coal flowing and meet ever higher quotas while always focused with determination on keepingmen safe from the ever-present danger of injury and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Hickam's parents had a love the author neverdoubted, he also knew they rarely agreed on just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Carrying Albert Home, he was able toshow them as young and in love, to tell the story of love that their road trip cemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, with a little authoriallicense, Hickam could give his dad a moment in the sun, to see what might have been if he'd chosen a differentpath in life whether it was working in sunny Florida or pursuing a career in baseball.ON HIS BREAKTHROUGH SUCCESS AS A WRITER...IN THE THIRD GRADEIf you've only seen the movie October Sky or read the book Rocket Boys, you might be surprised to hear thatNASA, NASA, NASA was not the burning ambition of Homer Hickam Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, it's always been writing.Probably the proudest day of his life -- and certainly the moment that pleased his mother the most -- was the firsttime Hickam held in his hands a copy of Torpedo Junction (that work of military history that was his firstpublished book).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, teachers and librarians fed the voracious Hickam a steady stream of books and heknew he wanted to write one of his own ever since a fateful class assignment in the third grade.Oh and when they turn Carrying Albert Home into a movie (and they will), here's a great idea for casting: JakeGyllenhaal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he's old enough to play the father of the character he played at 16, especially since Homer Sr.is supposed to be stoic, strong, maybe a little cowed by love but handsome enough to be a film star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, aftera string of dark movies, Gyllenhaal could use a switch to the light romantic tone this comic tale calls for.You can watch the entire interview at BookFilter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just click on the video on the front page.Learn more about Carrying Albert Home here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find a full review and quick links to buy it from all the topretailers.</p>
