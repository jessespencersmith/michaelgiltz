"Dead Wait," with the insidearticle headlined "FEMA Fool Sat On His Hands." Even an Op-Edcolumn by Ralph Peters in the NY Post on Tuesday that tries todefend Bush and denounce "playing politics" can't resistblasting the buffoons in charge:The Bush administration seems to have a problemwith serious planning outside of a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ourtroops were sent into Iraq without an occupation plan andnow we find that, four years after 9/11, the Department ofHomeland Security, which swallowed the FederalEmergency Management Agency, appears to have done noserious planning for a national disaster.What on earth has DHS been doing...?What's striking is that the administration and thestaffers at Homeland Security didn't seem to grasp allthe resources available to them -- or even what theirresponsibilities were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anything but reassuring, theclumsy initial response to Katrina must have Islamistterrorists stroking their beards, smiling and thinkingahead....And furious over Europe's sometimes callous attitude towards thisdisaster, he blasts their leadership for an unforgivable dereliction ofduty:When the last water recedes, we may find that a fewthousand Americans died in a great natural catastrophe.But two years ago, during a heat-wave, 25,000 elderlyEuropeans died unnecessarily in France, Italy and Germanywhile their political leaders, medical personnel andeven their children went on vacation -- and stayed onvacation.I agree: leaders of countries who stay on vacation duringunprecedented national disasters are beyond contempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE POSTS ABOUT: KATRINA Add New CommentYou are commenting as a Guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may select one to log into: Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's crew ofRescue Rangers were vcmvo2, grog, dopper0189,shayera, and joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, dadanationlooked editorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh yeah, a big shout ...1 minute ago HuffPost PoliticsPalin's Next Step Is Still A Mystery - Sarah Palinwill enter uncharted political waters when sheleaves the Alaska stage Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the questionis whether she will go on to become...1 minute ago FiredoglakeLate Night: MSNBC â€“ Will Any RepublicanDenounce Rush Limbaugh? - I sure do remember atime when the GOP made Barack Obama denounceJeremiah Wright, insisting that if he didn't it wasan explicit endorsement of anything W...46 minutes ago Crooks and LiarsC&amp;L's Late Nite Music Club - Friday Night Ripoffswith Green Day and Chicago - Title: Brain Stew vs.25 or 6 to 4 Artist: Green Day vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chicago Chicago- 25 or 6 to 4 Green Day - Brain Stew This is thethird post in a series called ...47 minutes ago AMERICAblog GayE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Harris Dies - NYT: E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Harris, thebest-selling author of novels that addressedquestions of identity and sexuality among blackmen, has died, his publicist told Th...3 hours agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Even ...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/even-new-york-post-blas... 1 of 57/25/09 12:19 AMA M E R I C A B L O G T V Visit our AMERICAblog TV site.see all 329 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod Southern Poverty LawCenter calls on CNN to A two minute explanationof the warped and cynical The economy is better.But....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge order San Diego toget rid of the seals Massive brawl in SouthKorean parliament Mormons may havesecretly baptizedNext 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Even ...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/even-new-york-post-blas... 2 of 57/25/09 12:19 AMEzra KleinTab Dump4 hours agoWonk RoomF-22 Killed BySeven-Meme Voltron4 hours agoNYCeveHuge victories: Maloney&amp; Pingree - Health CareHeroes, Clyburnreceives petition - video5 hours agoDaily DoseWill Doctors in theHouse, SenateInfluence Debate?6 hours agoThe TreatmentDoes the GOP ReallyHave an AlternativePlan in the Works?6 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
