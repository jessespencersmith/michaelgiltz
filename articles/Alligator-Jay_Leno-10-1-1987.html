                <p>, .1'_. ~y MICHAEL GILTZ'; In 1986, when comedian Jay Leno was selling out Carnegie . '.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hall, appearing on Late Night with . . .David Letterman more than any other guest and generally hitting the big time, a producer for the CBS newsmagazine West 57th Street decided to trail Leno and get "the real scoop." ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the producer was unable. to unearth anything (Leno doesn't drink or do drugs, and he isjust as ...... friendly 9ffstage as he is on), West :::-;.'; 57th Stredaired a segment on the . stand-up comic that would make Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go'odwrench .look a little shifÂ­ ty in comparison .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It appears Leno is just an ordinÂ­ ary, nice guy. r.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, that is what makesÂ· Ilim so unique among today's crowded field of comedians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a time when every jokester worth his salt has a "hook" or "catch phrase" -Sam Kinison screams, Steven Wright mumbles and Howie Mandel gurgles -Leno is simply ... well, funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leno will bring his uniquely . normal brand of humor to Gator Growl this October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the larÂ­ gest "student-run pep rally in the wodd, but the prospect of perÂ­ forming in front of more than _AO 10,000 people does not seem to daunt him. "I'll be there at the Gator Growl!" he barks like a carnival shyster. _ When told this was presumably the largest audience he would ever face, Leno said, "Well, I've got that thing in Red Square." Will he be doing anything diffeÂ­ rently from his regular shows? "6~~'i~usly, you do BIG JOKES!" Leno said, laughing . "No, it'll be fun, a nice intimate thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll get to do my disappearÂ­ ing dime trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'll be great." If past experience is any indicaÂ­ tion, it will be great. 'Leno perÂ­ formed at the 'O'Connell Center about two years ago :and' his twoÂ­ hour show was ecstatically reÂ­ ceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wry, insightful style ca~ best be described as the opposite of Don Rickles': Rather than insultÂ­ ing people and putting them down, he treats them as equals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leno lets his audience in on the joke, and together they laugh at how silly the rest of the world can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of his favorite topics is TV Guide, the most widely read publiÂ­ cation in the country. "Since when is TV Guide literaÂ­ ture?" Leno (and his' audience) groans. " 'Honey, when are you gonna stop reading and come to bed?' 'Just a couple of more hours, dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to see who's on Cross Wits for the rest of the week.' " It's funny stuff, and it. doesn't hurt that the man delivering it has a likeable mug that resembles noÂ­ thing so much as Dudley DoÂ­ Right come to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That mug soon will be appearing at a theater near you, for Leno was giving this telephone interview from the set of Collision Course, his third film and first starring role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had two small parts in The Silver Bears and American Hot Wax. "It's a movie with Pat Morita (of Karate Kid fame)," Leno expÂ­ lains. "Collision Course is a comedy/adventure .. .I guess in the vein of Beverly Hills Cop. "I play an American detective and Pat plays a Japan.ese detecÂ­ tive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, there's a switch," he continues jokingly. "I'm investiÂ­ gating one crime, Pat's investigatÂ­ ing another crime and they're reÂ­ lated, so we keep bumping into each other all the time." But d(m't worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though Leno wouldn't mind working on more films, he has no intention of being lured to the bright lights of Hollywood and abandoning his live shows. "Yeali," he said, "if it's a good movie, I'd like to do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But movies are a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're not as much fun as doing your act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I prefer being a stand-up comeÂ­ dian, if only because comedy is so much fun when you're doing it. "When you're making a movie, it's not really fun because you do it eight different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You do the o . 'Comedy is like sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it's good, you want to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it's bad, you go "Uuuoooh." -JeyLeno master shot, the reverse (shot) and all that kind of stuff and it takes hours and hours to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you have to wait six months to a year to find out if the movie's funny-, whereas in comedy you do the joke right away (and get a reacÂ­ tion). "When you do a joke while filming a movie, you go, 'Hmm, that's kind of funny,' and the crew kind of laughs but you never really know," he said. . "Movies are fun after you've done them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fun to sit in a restaurant and have people go, (squeals of delight) 'Oh, we just saw your movie,' and you go, (aloof and self-satisfied) 'Oh, reÂ­ ally?'" Leno's nice-guy persona and razor sharp comic delivery make to believe Leno when he says that success on the silver screen won't change him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a stage in his career when he .. could limit himself to select apÂ­ pearances in big auditoriums, Leno chooses to tour constantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He usually does about 300 shows a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, Leno can command S15,000 a shot at the larger veÂ­ nues, but you get the distinct imÂ­ pression he is just as happy perÂ­ forming at a Kiwanis Club lunÂ­ cheon as at Carnegie Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leno says when he plays at an out-of-the-way town, "People walk up to me and say, 'What the hell are you doing here?' But this is what I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I enjoy doing shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When people have a funny story to tell, they run around the office -or wherever it is -and they him an ideal candidate for the ------------Â­ movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there is every reason . see LENO, po~e 16 'No, it'll be fun, a nice Â·ntim,..... .. thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll get to do mydisapÂ­ pearing dime k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If II be great:' -J~Lenoon ";;'1"IT~r"'\r Growl 'tell each Person the story,; If it lets a laugh, it's fun to tell ap,fa." ~ Leno sounds a little bei~led.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's doing what he 10veA ~"~d! much to his surprise. being handsomely for itÂ· -._ ......... ,' ... $500,000 a year.'
