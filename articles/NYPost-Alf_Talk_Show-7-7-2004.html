                <p>eee By MICHAEL GIL TZ IF the stiff, unloved ani­ mated cartoon "Space Ghost" can be turned into a drolly amusing talk show. there's no reason why hand puppet Alf - star of his own wildly suc­ cessful, albeit short-lived, sitcom -shouldn't get to host his own talk show, too. lt debuts tonight at 10 p.m on TV Land, and he's even ~ot Ed McMahon out 01 cold storage to s~rve as a sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An instant pop cultural smash when it debuted in 1986, "Alr' spawned an animated cartoon of its own, books about the life of Alf (an Alien Life Form from the planet Melmac) and all sorts of merchan­ dising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It peaked in the Top 10 and then disap­ peared_ BlIt All', a comic with a bOI scht belt sensibility, found a secund life as an advertising pitchman , and now he's hosting" AU's Hit Talk Show," talking to Dennis Franz and fel· low washed-up sitcom star Drew Carey -with special appearances by Henry Winkler and Joan Rivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, it's an entire show devoted to proving that in America everyone gets a second act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We chatted with him by email this week: Q; Choosing to do inter­ views only by email is pretty Garbo-esque of you -have you be­ come a bit of a recluse? A: Being a recluse has nothing to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Semi-intelligent life form tells all about talk show TrlIth is, my phone got shut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that I'm back at work with this new talk show, I'll be cor­ recting that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there a number 1 can reach you at? Q; Your age -you're now 247 years old, right? A: Honestly, I stopped counting after I hit the big 2·0·0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joan Collins gave me that wise advice over 80 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll al­ ways remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q; Any problems of being an illegal alien in the U.S. or were you naturalized a Icng time ago? A: Let me set you straight on Ihis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the United States, there's a big dif· ference between being an Alien from Outer Space and an "illegal" alien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The illegal aliens get medical and educa­ tional henefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I get nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q; How will your ap­ proach be different from other TV talk show hosts? Sarcasm seems the coin of the realm in late night these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: I think sarcasm has run its course, It's way overdon e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope to raise the benchmark all talk shows and substitute sarcasm with slander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haaaaa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Which talk show host do you most ad­ mire and why? A: It's a tough Question , but if I had to pick one, I'd say that Sally Jesse is still doing a good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That woman never fails to make me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q; I'm sure you're quickly becoming aware of the booking wars on talk shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How can you gain an edge on your oppo­ nents? ~'.';i'"t.'l. ... \" . :f.;'jf" A: I am opposed to any kind of war, .. especially booking W~HS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Violence is no way to settle things ... especi-all y with talk shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd like to see a DMZ zone for talk show guests It would provide a safe haven for whatever choices they make reo garding television ap-. pearances .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean sefl­ ouslv .•. can't we all just get along? .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Will there be cats available for snacking in the Green Room? A: A lot of shows have been serving eat­ based snacks in their green looms for years without anyone knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C'mon, what do you think is the main ingredient in the famous "To· night Show Pate?" Q: Any grudges against celebri­ ties who loved you when you were on top but wouldn't return your " calls lately? A: As you know, Holly\vood is a 'II fickle town Erik Estrada and I talk abuut this all the time. 1 would love to give you the names of all those two-faced, back­ stabbing, insincere celeb· rities who shunned me ... but now that I have a show to book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wQulun't _ want to upset them. . ... ~.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q; Normally, we don't .. - deal in tabloid rumors, but the reports about your stints at Betty Ford and claims that it was just an "addiction to painkillers" have been so widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Want to talk about these rumors? A: I think you're confus­ ing me with Courtney Love, although in the mid 'SOs I did have an addic­ tion to cotton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ThJnk­ fullv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wa' introouceu to Rayon and other syn­ thetic hlends. and I can honestly say that as of Ihis day I am completely &lt;a cotton frer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q; Any activity in your love life? A: Are you referring to activity that I don't have to pay for? Q: Do you have a fea­ ture mm in the works? A: I don·t want to jinx it, h\n I'm up for the lead role in the Herve Ville­ ehaize story. // Alt, the '80s , sitcom star, has .landed his own talk show,</p>
