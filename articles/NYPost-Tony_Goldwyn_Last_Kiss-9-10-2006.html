                <p>~ MOVIES ; NEXT STOP: 'LAST KISS' &lt;D o o '" o M 0; .0 E ~ &lt;D (f) ~ D C " (f) Zach Braff's new film helped director Tony Goldwyn grow up BY MICHAEL GILTZ A ctorTonyGoldwyn has only directed three movies, buht has happened every time: He catches the star on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his 1999 gem "A Walk on the Moon," Goldwyn worked with Viggo Mortensen just as the actor was poised for super­ stardom in "The Lord of the Rings." In the little-seen 2001 "Someone Like You," Goldwyn cast Hugh Jack­ man as a romantic leading man when most others still thought he was just an "X-Men" hero with claws Now, in the comedy-drama "The Last Kiss," Goldwyn's got Zach Braff of TV's "Scrubs" and the film "Gar­ den State" (which Braff also directed) just as he's ready for bigger things. "Zach's just coming into his own as a performer," says Goldwyn. "In a way, this character is a whole new thing for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 'Garden State,' good as he was in it, he was more reacting to all the people around him. "In this movie, Zach really drives the thing." A remake of a 2001 Italian film, "The Last Kiss" follows four young men in Madison, Wis., scared stiff about the onslaught of adult respon­ sibilities .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Izzy (Michael Weston) wants to escape on a road trip after being dumped by a girlfriend and tending to his ailing dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) has a strict poli- cy of no-strings sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris (Casey Aft1eck), married with a new­ born baby, stays late at work rath, er than dealing with the over­ whelming needs of his young family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And at the center is Michael (Braff), who's got a gorgeous -and pregnant -girlfriend (J acinda Barrett) who doesn't mind his fear of marriage .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no wonder: her mother· (Blythe Danner) is about to revea I an extramarital affair and leave her dad (Tom WJ.i.kinson) . "There's a lot required of Zach as an actor -he has to be funny and emo­ tional and empathetic," says Goldwyn . "Somehow, he manages to maintain the audience's empathy through­ out the movie, even during the moments they hate him." Despite Goldwyn's knack for heat-seeking actors, directing is a midcareer switch for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He worked for many years as an actor, playing ev­ erything from a memorably evil yuppie in "Ghost" to a closeted TV star on "The L Word." He was even the voice of the title hero in Disney's 1999 animated film "Tarzan." And he has been behind-the-scenes on Tv, guiding episodes of "Grey's Anato­ my," the new drama "Kidnapped" and Showtime's "Dexter." And GoldW'jll of course has movies in his blood: His grandfa­ ther was Samuel Goldwyn -the G in MGM -and his father is producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. " 'The Last Kiss' was a film that really interested me be­ cause it felt very reaJ." Goldwyn says. "When I read the script, I thought it was a chance to make a film that could be fun­ ny and entertaining, and honest about how hard it is to navigate relationships and commitmen t "And it involves the process of coping with crises, of all sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What happens when life doesn't go the way you planned it." • CLINCHING IT Director Tony Goldwyn (above, on set) says with "The Last Kiss" (below), actor Zach Braff "comes into his own," while co-star Rachel Bilson "is so confident, it's like she's been acting for 20 years."</p>
