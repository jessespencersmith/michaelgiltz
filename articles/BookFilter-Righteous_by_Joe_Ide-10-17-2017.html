"Righteous" does a similar trick, though not as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here again we see IQ dealing with a complicated case involving Vegas, gamblers up to their ears in debt, a prostitution ring and organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That'scontrasted with a second story where IQ discovers his brother was murdered and becomes determined to figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inthe first book, IQ was always seven steps ahead of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, he's been "reset" -- we see him learning on the job,sometimes petulant, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His partner/sidekick is also fleshed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Watson and so many others, Dodson is super annoyed that IQ is so smart and never asks for an opinion or advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Determined to prove himself, Dodson is nobody's fool and that makes their dynamic fresh and surprising, a solid new twist on an old idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crime and its resolution isn't themystery's strength -- it's the characters, from the female deejay who loves her loser, gambling boyfriend to Dodson'spregnant woman, who stares down gangsters with unnerving calm. "Righteous" is a good book and Ide is playing the long game by ratcheting down IQ's savvy and giving him room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This should be a very good series. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Ide's debut, IQ, was one of last year's best crime novels, and he follows it with another scorcher. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the great Thomas Perry, Ide manages to combine light and dark in wholly unpredictable ways, blending comic capering with real-life bloodletting in a manner that diminishes neither and taps a vein of deep emotion lurking amid the laugh lines and spurts of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyonewho loves Perry or Timothy Hallinan needs to hop on Ide's bandwagon while there's still room to sit.""Joe Ide is the best new discovery I've come across in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Isaiah Quintabe is the kind of sleuth not seen on the mystery landscape before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Righteous is a riveting follow up to IQ."Ã¢Michael Connelly, author of The Late Show - "Last year, Joe Ide became the best thing to happen to mystery writing in a very long time. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are a lot of fine reasons to discover Ide's work. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He writes thumbnail descriptions that rival Elmore Leonard's. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hisdialogue, much of it unprintable here, has bite that puts him in the Winslow/Lehane league. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world ofthese books is one of constant trash talk, and Ide delivers it with style. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may be time for Ide to lay to restIsaiah's Marcus obsession and give him other things to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait to find out what they'll be."Ã¢ Janet Maslin , New York Times - "Excellent...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ide keeps Righteous on a righteous path of compelling storytelling, allowing his characters to flourish while exploring the worst of human nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never once does Righteous go over the top as Ide keeps each plot point chillingly realistic...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ide's debut IQ showed what a skillful writer he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Righteous elevates the author--and his characters--to a new level."Ã¢ Oline Cogdill , The Associated Press - "Ide is the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This column was late, because I couldn't stop reading my advance copy."Ã¢ Allison K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hill , Long Beach Press-Telegram - "Outstanding . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ide again makes his hero's deductive brilliance plausible, while presenting an emotionallyengaging story that doesn't shy away from presenting the bleakest aspects of humanity."Ã¢ Publishers Weekly (starred review) - Ã¢Booklist (starred review) - "Brilliantly executed . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deftly weaving the search for Marcus's killer with various escapades in Vegas, Ideemploys a clever mixing of time lines that will keep readers guessing until the explosive, bloody denouement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Awinning combination of skillful writing and flawless pacing, this second series outing is packed with adrenaline-inducing scenes along with a colorful cast of violent and treacherous villains."Ã¢ Library Journal (starred review) - "The game's afoot once again for 20-something genius sleuth Isaiah Quintabe. . . . [Ide] keeps your head in the game throughout with his witty style and edgy storytelling, both of which show greater assurance than in hisfirst novel--and even bigger potential for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A thrilling follow-up to one of the more auspicious detective-series debuts in recent memory."Ã¢ Kirkus Reviews - "Righteous is action packed, cerebral and altogether engaging, and I predict a long string of follow-up novels in this fine series."Ã¢ Bruce Tierney , Bookpage - "Introducing one of the best loved detectives in the recent annals of crime fiction... a shot of adrenaline for Sherlock-style mystery lovers."Ã¢ Dwyer Murphy , Lit Hub - What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us Â©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
