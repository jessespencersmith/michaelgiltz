Your sympathies tendto ping-pong back and forth with each newrevelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as Adam (Norbert Leo Butz) andJan (Elizabeth Marvel) bicker and fight the nightbefore he goes away on a business trip and whiletheir unseen son is away on a sleep-over, it's not your sympathy that skip back and forth, it's your antipathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This far too routine story of domestic strife, with accusations of cold lovelessness on the one hand and serial unfaithfulness on the other doesn't reveal any great truths -- it just reveals two peoplewho don't seem to belong in each other's company and certainly don't belong in ours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mostintriguing character is that little boy, a kid with a protective love of his hamster, a kid who hasvirtually no friends and a kid who tends to go hiding by piling up clothes in a closet and burrowingdown to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fifty Words would like to burrow down as well to the heart of the matter, but that center is hollow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two fine actors aren't shown to their best because of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marvel admirably plays Jan without any soft touches; she doesn't try and win our sympathy, thereby earning some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Butz is rather high-pitched, the sort of performance one gives when you sense the material you've been handed isn'tquite enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was my first chance to see this Tony-winning actor who's made a name forhimself in musicals like Thou Shalt Not, Wicked and his star-making turn in Dirty RottenScoundrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I kept thinking of Richard Dreyfuss and just like Dreyfuss -- or any good actor -- Butz can seem to be straining when the character is paper-thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I look forward to seeing him insomething more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others are saying: Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

The New York Daily News' Joe Dziemianowicz said: Two stars out of five. "It's never a good sign when a review begins by praising a play's set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let's get right to the superb scenic design of "Fifty Words," the unimpeachable aspect of Michael Weller's disagreeable marriage drama...." The New York Post's Frank Scheck said: Two stars out of four. "Unfortunately, the play never quite convinces, due to endless, quicksilver tonal shifts: This is one couple that can veer from post-coital bliss to brutal attacks within seconds." Theatremania's David Finkle said: "Granted, Weller writes convincing dialogue for two smart and accomplished people who know each other so well they can quickly locate every pushable button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But convincing dialogue doesn't necessarily equate with a convincing play....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fortunately, Marvel(who's eventually required to appear topless in an extended scene) is mesmerizing in her ability toresemble a tightly-wound spring tightening, and Butz, whose dancing skill in Dirty RottenScoundrels has clearly prepared him for a different kind of compelling choreography, is a coupledozen springs sprung from a confining box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the situation Weller puts them in is only passinglyrealistic, their performances are so real that the audience's temptation to turn away from the painis all but constant." Bloomberg's John Simon said: "...this exhausting two-hander....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why do two accomplished actors and one multitalented director -- Pendleton is also a fine actor and acting teacher -- go for this stuff? Because it lends itself to an unbridled display of acting and directing exercises." THAT OTHER WOMAN'S CHILD: A BLUEGRASS MUSICAL As part of the New York Musical Theatre Festival, I checked out That Other Woman's Child, as much for the subhead "a bluegrass musical" as any other reason, since I love bluegrass music and thought any show rooted in that genre would at least feature some nimble music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this over-stuffed comic melodrama, the step-daughter of the man that dumped the family matriarch -- Granny Loomis -- has returned to town upon his death and everyone assumes this citywoman (red-headed, no less) is out to stake her claim to the failing family farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the giantKnob extended family isn't terrorized by Granny, they're pushed around by the family preacher(Allan Ledford).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's also a daughter unhappily engaged to a brutish suitor, a son who wants toleave home and become a country singer and enough in-laws and outlaws to keep the tiny stagethis show was performed on bursting at the seams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of this is played at the level of a skit on Hee-Haw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listening to characters called Leviticus Numbers and Matthew Mark or Luke John or Corinthianne gets real old, real fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, Hee- Haw had lame jokes but it also had GREAT music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this show had great music, too, no one would care about the straining plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the music is not up to Hee-Haw standards and rarely bluegrass to boot. (Throwing in a banjo doesn't mean a song is immediately bluegrass -- you need ajazzy, improvisatory feel to achieve that.) The show ends with enough weddings to make Jane Austen seem miserly in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the large cast does its able best, helped along by choreography (Mark Knowles) and direction (SherryLandrum, who also co-wrote the show with George S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clinton) that deserves credit just for keepingfolk from bumping into each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But too many songs fall back on banal lyrics and the few thatdon't (such as the modestly clever "True Partners," which looks at couples from the Bible) arechained to flat melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only a few times does someone break out of the noisy story to hit a real emotional note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The perenially knocked-up Song of Solomon (yep, that's her name -- told you it gets old) sings"Honeysuckle" and in her one moment in the spotlight, Erin Parker delivers this tune with the highlonesome ache one associates with bluegrass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later, tall glass of water and would-be singer JimmyJohn (Quinn VanAntwerp, which has to be the least country name imaginable) delivers the fairlyanonymous "Wings of Freedom" with a little bit of Elvis and then really scores with "All AboutMama," a genuine (or if you prefer, "gen-u-wine") bit of country hokum that would indeed kill on "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...
