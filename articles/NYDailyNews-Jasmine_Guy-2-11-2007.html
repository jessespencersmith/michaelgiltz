"Cane." "My mother is an English lit teacher and my father [apastor] is also aprofessor," says Guy. "I ran it by her and she said, 'Oh, "Cane" - your father's favorite novel.'I said, 'It is?'and then, for years, he passed as white."

"It seems like we go from slavery to the l'Rbisin' Cane," which tours through mid- Ilarch, captures the spirit of the Harlem Re- npiss4nce by drawing on the words and po- eqrs and songs and speeches ofpeople like Cpuntee Cullen and Zora Neale Hurston, Fa- ther Divine and Claude McKav.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combined w,rth photos and paintings of and by the aliti6tp, with a jazz score byAvery Sharpe (fho performs live with his trio), the play bf'tlarry Clarke strives to capture that vi- ; i!
