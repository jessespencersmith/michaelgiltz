Why won't he go to the local hospital and getmedical care? What has John done to make himself so wary and why is a local white man who always had it in for him (or so John says) asking after John? Are Simon's wife and daughter safe with his former master? Or have they run off to a new life? And what's with the Passover celebration? Caleb's family are Jews and so naturally their slaves followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; War has turned Caleb into an atheist -- or at least a man who can't be bothered to pray anymore when he never gets an answer -- but Simon takes great comfort and pride in his faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second act revolves around a seder and the sweet irony of a ceremony that looks toward a freedom that Simon and John now see in their grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's a curious detail that never truly comes to life, as if Lopez discovered the fact that some Southern slave owners were Jewish and just put that in as a fascinating twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A brief reference makes it sound like the whole neighborhood was filled with Jewish slave owners, but that's as far as this insight goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didbeing Jewish alienate Caleb's family from other Southern families? Did it mark their slaves from other slaves? Did it make the family feel or believe it treated their slaves "better?" Did Simon and Joseph ever practice any other faith and then convert? Do they see the Jewish faith as their own now or perhaps arelic of their slave days, just like their last names came from their owners as well? Truly, if you're going to mine such a curious historical detail, it should permeate the tale more completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, we are given the sort of dramatic revelations that come so fast and furious the show starts to feel like a daytime soap (the dramatic thunder doesn't help matters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even from the start we feelunmoored -- Simon's relationship with Caleb is never convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A former slave meeting his formerowner's son for the first time since Emancipation is a highly charged and distinctive moment and somehow the shifting sands of their relationship just don't come convincingly to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, the piece is anchored as best it can be by a solid cast that give it their all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilkison is fine as Caleb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holland -- so good in the recent Broadway revival of Joe Turner's Come and Gone and the Public production of The Brother/Sister Plays -- has the most fun with the charming John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Braugher does his best with the stiff Simon, bringing what he can to the modest story of meeting Abraham Lincoln (the greatest moment of his life) and pumping what life he can into a section where Simon is singing and slapping his thighs while preaching during the Passover celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like an August Wilson moment without the poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Braugher does his best, you're always aware of the attempt at theatricality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, it's an interestingly flawed, ambitious work poorly served by the direction of Doug Hughes, the scenic design by John Lee Beatty and the lighting by Ben Stanton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One good moment was the way theydepicted Caleb in a snowstorm writing a letter to the woman he loved (a slave, you won't be surprised to hear).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that was undercut by a text that echoed too much the famous Civil War letter by Sullivan Ballou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the direction and look of the show wasn't getting in the way of the play, the play wasgetting in the way of the production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, with more plays and more productions, Lopez will be able to discover what he is capable of achieving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Lopez discussing an earlier production of The Whipping Man at the Old Globe in San Diego.
