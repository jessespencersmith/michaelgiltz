                <p>NYP TV WEEK ... • REALLY BIG SHOW Ready, set, go -around the world in 30 days By MICHAEL GILTZ WIDELY considered the'smartest, best­ produced reality show, "The Amazing Race" was on the verge of cancellation -until it beat out the heavily favored ''Ameri­ can Idol" at the Emmys last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's launching a new 13-hour season, the show's fIfth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to host Phil Keoghan, you can thank the Emmy for all this attention. "I certainly believe it was a huge factor in people saying, 'Hold on a minute:" says Keoghan, a native New Zealander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he says the "Race" team is determined to turn the cult hit into a mainstream phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This season, which kicks off at a pier in Santa Monica, Calif., fans can expect 11 new teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They include a Christian couple who are also models, and -in the show's most noteworthy addition - a pair of cousins, one of whom is a little person. ''A lot of people are asking me, 'Have you made changes for them?' " says series co­ creator Bertram van Munster about the team of Charla and Mirna. "We have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our experience has taught us that teams can catch up if they use their brains." Indeed, one of the highlights of the 90- minute opener is watching Charla, the lit­ tle person, try to hail a cab by seeming helpless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film then cuts to a pre-show interview where she observes that when people see her, they feel sorry and want to help. 'We're definitely going to use that," Charla says, like a seasoned pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are also three big innovations this sea­ son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teams who come in next-to-Iast get all their traveling cash taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fast For­ wards, which allow teams to skip select legs of the race and proceed to the pit stop, have been cut way down from one per team to two per season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there's now a Yield, a ploy which lets one team force another to stand still for a certain amount of time. "That turned out to be very, very effective," says van Munster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Keoghan, ''Amazing Race" has proven the ideal job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knew the show was working early in the first season when he was stopped on the street in New York and asked to repeat his sig-. nature line, "You've been eliminated from the race!" "I said the line and the guy says, 'No, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like you do on the show, with the eyebrow:" Keoghan says. " 'We're going to run up [again], and we want the eyebrow: " THE AMAZING RACE Tuesday. 9:30 p.m., CBS</p>
