(Which left a good decade for the effects of his prescriptions to be felt, though it's never mentioned again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The doctor's downfall also led a few years later to Van Cliburn's decade-long absence from performing, a point worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Isakoff leaps over this decade-long gap rather quickly.) Isakoff is also ginger when it comesto Cliburn being gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's mentioned almost as an aside that Cliburn and most of his close friends studying at Juilliard weregay or bi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And his first important relationship is mentioned in passing a decade AFTER it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine Cliburn having beenmarried and a biographer not bringing it up chronologically until a decade after they tied the knot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's confusing and annoying in equal parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, major events seem to have happened long ago or long in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More importantly, the fact that most critics consider Cliburn to have had a pretty tragic, uninteresting career is almost tooimpolite for Isakoff to mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cliburn quite clearly never came close to fulfilling his early potential, though he remainedworld famous to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One doesn't want sensationalizing and perhaps Isakoff simply didn't have access to any diaries or materials to fully illuminate the artist's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for a man who was clearly a maniacal hoarder, enjoyed a weirdly intimate relationship with his mother, became addicted to speed thanks to a dreadful medical practitioner, collapsed onstage,stopped performing for a decade and made sentimental but never artistic comebacks, his life comes across here as prettyuneventfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had a happy ending personally, finding romance in another relationship that lasted until the end of his life.Cliburn even had his partner on his arm for late career honors, which is pretty amazing given the repressive society he began in. (Both US and Russian officials seemed to worry quite a lot about Cliburn's sexual orientation creating problems for them in the 1950s and later, amusingly enough.) The material of his life is dramatic and diverse but Isakoff can't quitecapture the sweep or bring alive some very tantalizing details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has moments of insight (especially about the intersectionof politics and culture) but gets swamped by the passages that demand a more clear-eyed appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cliburn may have been a sentimentalist, but his story needs someone less willing to overlook the sadder, more tragic moments where he lost nerve or squandered opportunity to turn this friendly, useful account into one that reaches for greatness. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Illuminating… This well-rounded biography will move readers… Essential reading for music lovers.” — Booklist “A touching portrait of Cliburn… Moving.” — Kirkus “When the World Stopped to Listen is a great book about a great American musician who, in the tensions of Cold War, helped move our world from war to peace, from direct confrontation to peaceful coexistence.” —Sergei Khrushchev, author, Khrushchev in Power "Stuart Isacoff's book is an exciting, thorough, and deeply moving reminder of Van Cliburn's triumph at theTchaikovsky Competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His penetrating comments on the elements that made Cliburn's playing so profoundlyinvolving, and his sympathetic chronicle of the pianist's life, make this book a most satisfying experience." —Emanuel Ax, musician "A gripping story of an iconic American pianist, set in a dark era of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A great read, not only for musicians, marvelously researched and written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn't put the book down." —Yefim Bronfman, concert pianist “Stuart Isacoff lets us relive the career-birth of an American musical hero and a politically momentous event as profound as the collapse… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
