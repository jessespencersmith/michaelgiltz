                <p>MOVIES TV COMICS GAMES Lee Majors looks back on the bionic man, Bigfoot and Farrah Fawcett Nov. 29, 2010 | 11:15 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee Majors as Steve Austin on "The Six Million Dollar Man" (ABC) Almost 40 years ago, when he was considering the starring role in a television movie about a “bionic man,” Lee Majors had one major worry: “The big hits at the time were, like, Batman, youknow how campy that was,” Majors recalled. “I said, ‘If you’re thinking about making this a camp character, I don’t want to do it.’” “The Six Million Dollar Man” wasn’t camp at all, and that choice proved to be right on the money for the landmark sci-fi adventure series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now, in a wry twist of fate, Majors is working withSyFy on a comedy spoof in which he is the bionic mentor to a younger hero. “Hey, what goes around comes around,” joked the easy-going Majors, who starred in eight television series– three of them big hits — and always looked so serene as he ran in slow motion through 1970s pop culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The signature success of his career is now getting its due with the elaborate 40-disc boxed set “The Six Million Dollar Man: 7 21 55« PREVIOUS POST | NEXT POST » E-mail Print Read Later Latest MOVIES ANIME TOP 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘FullmetalAlchemist’ lead 2010 s best » TV VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’ completes the Jedi joke trilogy » COMICS Frank Miller’s Christmas wish… » GAMES Guillermo del Toro: inSANE video gamewill be ‘immersive, powerful’ Lovecraftianadventure » @LATHerocomplex ANIME TOP 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ lead 2010 s best http://lat.ms/flziIV -8 hours ago ‘Tron: Legacy’ is a heritagemoment for Steven Lisberger http://lat.ms/ic0ilN -11 hours ago VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’completes the Jedi joke trilogy http://lat.ms/gkDx2A -12 hours ago VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’ completes the Jedi joke trilogy »Curse of the Spider-Man?

The new work is what keeps Majors running, but he knows the boxed set will spark even more interest in his daysas the machine man of the ABC network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show, based on the 1972 novel “ Cyborg “ by the late Martin Caidin , had plenty of touchstones, and the boxed collection runs with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set’s front features a 3D lenticular image of Majors in the role of Steve Austin , the astronaut who suffered massive injuries in a terrible crash but was implanted with cutting-edge technology that gave him superhuman speed,superhuman strength (in one arm) and superhuman telescopic vision (in one eye).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tilt the boxback and forth and Austin starts running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have to provide your own metallic-echo sound effect the way kids have done in schoolyard exploits for decades, but open the lid and you hear Anderson’s voice-over intro to the series (“ Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have the technology…” ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Majors has listened to fans recite that opening for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also routinely mention twoelements of the show: the Bionic Woman (for which Wagner won an Emmy) and Bigfoot , the hirsute giant that gave Austin his most sizable challenge and, through the performance by 7- foot-4 wrestler Andre the Giant , an unforgettable image for fans of the show.Dark Shadows Darwyn Cooke David Duchovny David Eick David Mazzucchelli David Ng David Tennant David Yates Dawn C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

People now believe there still is a Bigfoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People go out there searching for this thing….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andre was so big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We had this scene, we were out in the woods and he throws me about 10 yards and then he’s supposed to take a big run and jump up and land right on top of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He throws me and I’m laying there and it’s a sunny day and the sun is in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of a sudden, this dark cloud appears and he blocks the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’mclosing my eyes and waiting to be pancaked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he did not even touch me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s how good hewas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those professional wrestlers are something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was one time I really thought I wasgoing to get it.” Majors knows about getting walloped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Detroit native played football at Eastern Kentucky University but a severe back injury during a game left him incapacitated and unsure if he’d ever walk again. “I was in the hospital for two days, but it seemed more like two weeks,” Majors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That ended his college career, and he headed to Los Angeles to take acting classes and worka job in the city parks system — a job he held even after landing the pilot for the western “ The Big Valley ,” starring Barbara Stanwyck .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aware of how fickle TV can be, Majors took a leave of absence on his city job rather than quitting outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The skepticism lasted even after the series was picked up, and Majors only officially left his job a few years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee Majors and Farrah Fawcett from third season of "The Six Million Dollar Man"(Universal Television/ABC) The role of Heath Barkley on the show gave him a catch phrase – “ Boy howdy! ” – which might have been a lesser man’s only claim to fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, when the show was unexpectedly picked up for a final season, Majors had to turn down a role in “ Midnight Cowboy .” Jon Voight famously went on wear the cowboy hat in that film, which won the Oscar for best picture of 1969. (On a positive note, a feature-film version of “The Big Valley” — with Majors now playing the father of Heath — is tantalizingly close to happening.)Phillips Jim Henson Jim Starlin Joe Johnston Joel Silver Joe Sacco Joe Simon John Carpenter John Horn John Lasseter John Milius John Noble Johnny Depp Jonah Hex Jon Favreau Joseph Kosinski Joss Whedon Joyce Farmer Jurassic Park Karate Kid Katniss Everdeen Kenneth Branagh Kenneth Turan Kevin Smith Kick Ass King Kong Kristen Stewart L.A. events Last Airbender League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Lego Leonard Nimoy Let Me In Liesel Bradner Lobo Lon Chaney Lord of the Rings Lost M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Night Shyamalan Mad Magazine manga Marc Guggenheim Marc Webb Maria Elena Fernandez Mark Milian Mark Waid Martin Campbell Marvel Mary McDonnell Mary McNamara Matt Damon Matthew Vaughn Matt Smith Merch Metropolis Michael Bay Michael Chabon Michael Ordoña Mike Mignola Mike Richardson Milla Jovovich MMORPG Moebius monsters motion comics Muppets Music Neal Adams Neil Gaiman Neill Blomkamp Nicolas Cage Ninjas Noelene Clark No Ordinary Family Nosferatu Olivia Munn Olivia Wilde Pan's Labyrinth Panzer 88 Patrick Day Patrick Stewart Paul Newman Paul Pope Paul W.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anderson Percy Jackson and the Olympians Peter Jackson Philip K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick Piranha 3D Pirates of the Caribbean Pixar Planet of the Apes Pokemon Politics Power Rangers Predator Prince of Persia promobox promobox-lede Quentin Tarantino Quizzam R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crumb R.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stine Rachel Abramowitz Random silliness Ray Bradbury Rebecca Keegan Reed Johnson Religion review Richard Donner Rick Riordan Ridley Scott RIPD Robert Abele Robert Downey Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Heinlein Robert Pattinson Robert Rodriguez Robert Zemeckis Robin Hood Robot Chicken Rocketeer Roger Corman Ron Howard Ron Moore Russell Crowe Ryan Reynolds Sam Mendes Sam Raimi Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson Sam Worthington Sandman Saw Scarlett Johansson Scott Pilgrim vs the World Scott Timberg Scream 4 Scream Awards Seth Rogen sex Sgt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rock Sherlock Holmes Shrek Signature Series Sigourney Weaver Simpsons Sin City Six Million Dollar Man Smallville Smurfs special effects Spider-Man Spiderman Stan Lee Stan Winston Stargate Star Trek Star Wars Stephenie Meyer stephen j. cannell Stephen King Steve Ditko Steve Niles Steven Moffat Steven Spielberg Steven Zeitchik Sucker Punch Super Superman Susan Carpenter Susan King Suzanne Collins Swamp Thing SXSW SyFy Sylvester Stallone Tarzan Taylor Lautner Television Terminator The Avengers The Cape The Crow The DarkMore TV work followed “Big Valley,” and Majors worked with talent like producer Aaron Spelling on an early TV movie about Vietnam vets and director Steven Spielberg in one of the wunderkind’s first assignments at Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then came “The Six Million Dollar Man.” Like “The A-Team ” in the 1980s, it was a bloodless action show, one reason Majors believes it proved such a hit for families. “We never killed anybody,” says Majors. “We’d walk away [after a fight] and you’d see them getting up or rolling around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You knew they were alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We didn’t use a lot of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was basically a father-son, father-daughter show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of kids watched it and they emulated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ihope I wasn’t responsible for any broken bones.” Majors insists that even though it and “The Bionic Woman” were in the Top 10, the impact the show had never really sank in. “When I was not working, I had a little place up in Arizona where I would spend my off time,” Majors said.“I didn’t have a television or a phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just fished andwould grow a beard and hide out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I knew it was a big show and in the Top 10 but I never thoughtabout how big it really was.” But surely the tabloid madness surrounding him and then-wife Farrah Fawcett couldn’t be ignored? “Well, we did have a problem then because she was doing ‘Charlie’s Angels,’” Majors says, moving on to discuss their divorce. “I saw her two weeks in one year, so that’s what happened tothat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn’t anything other than we didn’t have time to see each other.” The 1980s brought the hit series “ The Fall Guy ,” which gave the guy’s-guy actor a chance to work with practically every stuntman in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hoped it would separate his career from his bionic days, and it did — to a degree. “I jumped at ‘The Fall Guy’ when it came along because I thought it might help me get rid of the Steve Austin image,” Majors said. “It didn’t, really.Everywhere you go that’s the one they remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn’t matter because I can say I’ve doneeight other series and I’m still working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can say I wanna be just like Ernie Borgnine when Igrow up – 93 and still working.” – Michael GiltzRECENT AND RELATED Michael C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hall on knives, stargazing and O.J SimpsonJoss who?
