                <p>F R I D AY, N O V E M B E R 0 3 , 2 0 0 6"Wall Street Journal" Botches Story On "Studio60"It took two people to write a story for the Wall Street Journal on"Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip." They both got numerous facts wrong.Basically, the article wonders if a show that has very few (but very rich)viewers can survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say "no" (and indeed "Studio 60" will becancelled) but they're asking the wrong questions and getting theirfacts messed up in the process.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say viewers for "Studio 60" in its most recent week were about4 million -- Wrong! As their own chart included with the article shows,"Studio 60" scored about 7 million viewers the last time it aired.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say the last week "Heroes" aired before "Studio 60" it drewabout eight million viewers -- Wrong! The last week they were paired,"Heroes" reached about 14 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They might have confusedtotal viewers scores with the scores for the coveted 18-49 demo, buteven then their figures are closer but still off.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They say "Friday Night Lights" did worse in the time slot, dropping10% from the average of "Studio 60" -- technically correct, but verymisleading and ultimately wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the "average" for "Studio 60"was higher than the one-week showing of "FNL." But "Studio 60"opened to tons of hype (as opposed to the under-the-radar "FNL") andhas the biggest new hit of the season "Heroes" airing right before it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sratings have dropped every week since it debuted, even as the numbersfor "Heroes" get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact is that the one-time airing of "FNL"did BETTER than the previous week's episode of "Studio 60," evenAFTER adjusting for the higher lead-in from the growing hit "Heroes."In other words, "FNL" did a better job of holding onto the audience of"Heroes" than "Studio 60." To suggest otherwise is either ignorant oran example of a reporter trying to stack the deck in favor of thestoryline they prefer.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They claim overall revenue for a show depends on overall audience --Wrong! Way wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advertisers mainly care about the 18-49 demosand they definitely pay more for wealthier, more educated viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisis so much the rule now that some of the networks ignore the overallviewership totals and talk strictly about the 18-49 demo they reach.That's the demo that advertisers want and so a show that skews olderlike, say, "Walker Texas Rangers" on Saturday nights might have drawna big audience, but a smaller hit with better demos would make moreNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "Wall Street Journal" Botches Story On "...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/wall-street-journal-botc... 1 of 37/28/09 3:37 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SBiboyAaronMichael in New York POPSURFING.COM: "Wall Street Journal" Botches Story On "...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/wall-street-journal-botc... 2 of 37/28/09 3:37 PMPOPSURFING.COM: "Wall Street Journal" Botches Story On "...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/wall-street-journal-botc... 3 of 37/28/09 3:37 PM</p>
