                <p>44 "MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD" Director Peter Weir's grand vision of Lucky Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) leading his men into battle during the Na­ poleonic Wars ($39.98, Fox) deserves tbe broad canvas of a big screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the very attributes that kept it [rom becoming a blockbuster -subtle acting from Crowe and Paul Bettany (as his surgeon), a fine eye for detail and a resistance to pumped-up set pieces -make it ideal for home viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With loads extras -lengthy documentaries, deleted scenes and even a map -is it too much to hope huge DVD sales will let them make a sequel? "THE OFfICE": COMPLETE SECOND SERIES Painfully funny, this BBC series about the workers at a mis­ erable little paper products company ($24.98, BBC Video) be­ came the first international comedy to win Golden Globes for Best Comedy and Best Actor (for co-creator and star Rick)' Gervais).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second season ended with gut-wrenching emo­ tion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extras -including deleted scenes. bloopers and a video diary -ease the pain of knowing "The Office" is almost closed for good (only two new episodes are on tap). "THE INGMAR BERGMAN COlLECTION" "FLOAnfm WEEDS" Although the five lngmar Bergman films in this collection -"Persona," "Hour of the Wolf," "Shame," "Passion of Anna" and "The Serpent's Egg" -are available individually, this boxed set ($112.96, MGM) includes a sixth disc of extras, including a Swedish IIconversation" \vith Bergman from 2002 and a 1970 English interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the 100th birthday celebration of the legendary Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu is marked by a lovely packaging of his 1934 silent film "A Story of Floating Weeds" along with his 1959 remake, "Float­ ing Weeds" ($39.95; Criterion) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latter features audio commentary by Roger Ebet1. "I LEAGUE OF THEIR owr.!" ,Vho says l\ladonna can't act? Whether it's her debut in "Desperately Seeking Susan," her wisecracking moll in "Dick Tracy," her Golden Globe-winning turn as Argentina's "Evita" or her hilarious work in 1992's «A League of Their Own" ($24.96; Columbia TriStar), Madonna has delivered some sterling work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of extras, like commentar y from director Penny Marshall, a documentary and 15 deleted scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out: The Daryl Hannah revival gains speed with "Kill Bill: Vol. 2" in the theaters and the fine J ahn Sayies drama "Casa De Los Babvs" ($29.98, MGM) on DVD; "Win a Date With Tad Hamnton!" ($26.99, Universal) is fatally miscast -if a movie star is supposed to fall in love with an average girl, she shouldn't look like runway model Kate Bosworth; Christo­ pher Walken's incendiary 1990 drama "King of New York" Special Editioll ($19.98, Artisan); Oiiver North runs for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senate in the observant 1996 documentarv "A Perfect Candidate" ($24.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First Run); "Spinal Tap" heavy-metal in­ spiration Slade in their one and only rockumentary, 1974's "Slade in Flame" ($19.98, Shout).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim Burton's fantasy drama "Big Fish," Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister in "Love Actually." and the WolfMan Leg­ acy Collection.</p>
