                <p>o Fl =oz oz f,nDuran Duran are Broadway's n the 1980s, Duran Duran broke into worldwide fame - and the hearts of the "Wedding Singer" generation - with globetrotting videos like "Rio" and "Hungry Like the Wolf.,, But now they're bringing a world of fms to New York On Thursday, they begin an unprecedented nine-night at the Barrymore Theatre (243 \M 47th Sf ) and fans w stand at the Barrymore Theatre (243 \M 47th St ), and fans will flock in from all over to hear their new album. .Red Camet who've always been way ahead of critics: Princess Di- ana called the group her favorite, Andy Warhol and Keith Haringjoined them on MTY fashion icons like Vivienne Wesfwood and Giorgio Amani collaborated with them, and rap trailblzer Grandmaster Flash sang with the band on a cover of his hit'lMhite Lines (Don't Do It) " But the no-nonsense attitude of Timberlake md Tim- baland did give the band, which once labored for years over their records, a good swift kick in the pants "They like to get a song pretty much finjshed in a cou- ple days, really," says Le Bon "It's all about keePing the energy going while you're still excited about it " And how did the band that defined pretty-Brit seduc- tiveness get along with the man who brought sery back? "Sex and seduction and glamour," says Le Bon, "are the things we've olways stood for" aMassacre," out Nov. 13, perfomed live in its entirety. "That's the idea," says lead singer and lyricist Simon Le Bon, who just tumed 49 "And I hope it works out like that we've never done anlthing like this before and probably nev- er will again " Audiences will face a "battle of the lenses," as one song puts it, thanks to photographers who will prowl the red-carpet the- FF ocz E zoâ‚¬rilvild boys ater entrance, flashing fans' images, among oth- er things, on giant monitors inside the Barrymore But the show itself will focus on the new album's first cut-to-last presentation, as well as a Duran Duran dance set and, of course, a greatest-hitsl sectlon "We need to deliver the music, so we're not relfng on our ability to dance," says Le Bon drolly, well aware that it was the visuals in the early days of music video that hooked the frrst wave of MTV teens on "Union ofthe Snake," "Girls on Film," "Save a Prayer" and "Is There Something I Should Know?" The band's clrosic lineup - Le Bon, Roger Taylor, John 'Iaylor, Andy Taylor (the Taylors are unrelated) and Nick Rhodes - has morphed over time from five to four to three tojust two, and back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A tour several years ago with the full lineup was a huge success, spawning a decent-selling CD But after the politically angry album "R6portage," the band started from scratch without Andy Taylor, and it's the remaining four who'll play Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet unlike the Police (who'll play Madison Square Garden this week), these suruivors of perestroika-era pop aren't coasting on the past In fact, "Red Carpet Massacre" is generating great buzz and boasts collab- orations with Justin Timberlake and hip-hop producer Timbaland, without ever betraying the Bowie-ish white funk that defined the band from the start (When Tim- baland mentioned he was going into the studio to work with Duran Duran, Timberlake - who was bom in 1980, the same year the five band members fomed - reportedly said, "Not without me, you're not)- It's the latest sign of respect from fans and peers,</p>
