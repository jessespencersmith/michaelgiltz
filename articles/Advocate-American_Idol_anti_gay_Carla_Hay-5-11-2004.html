                <p>---arts&amp;eDtertaiDmeDt t was the Wild ard night of perf or­ mances on Fox TV's Amel"ican ldo~ and 23-year-old Mal'Clu Lynche was standing in front of U1 judg .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a new lwist. a dozen handpi k d semifinalists who hadn't yet made it to the final 12 were told to practice all week, but they wouldn't find out until the live broadcast whether they'd get a chance to sing for their one last shot The judges took turns handing out the verdict, and Lynche-Iooking hand­ some and confident and very Fame with his sleeveless vest, stud earrings, dan­ gling CruCifIX, and dancer's body-was televisioD America's favorite reality TV contest may be cutting contestants who appear "too gay" By Michael Giltz facing the tart-tongued Simon Cowell. "Marque, we brought you back be­ cause we all think you are a good singer," Cowell said as more than 24 million viewers watched. "However , we think you are more of a stage singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Therefore you will not be on the show tonight" THE ADVOCATE 1781 MAY 11, 2004 Lynche's mouth dropped open. "Are you serious?" he asked. "Sorry," said Cowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynche walked off the stage in a haze, never to be seen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What happened? Why would some­ one who all the judges agree has a good voice not be allowed to sing? Fox declined to put The Advocate in touch with Lynche, but some believe he was penalized for not seeming hetero enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynche has a real theater back­ ground-he joined the cast of the stage musical Fame on 42nd St. on April 13-but many Idol watchers believe that when the judges say someone is "too Broadway ," what they're really say­ ing is "You seem gay." Carla Hay of BiU­ board is one such observer. "For people who don't know the [gay] culture, that comment may go over their heads," says Hay, who covers TV for the music industry bible. "But from my pOint of view, that's basically what Simon is saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone he deems 'too Broadway' is someone he feels is too ef­ feminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he only says it about male singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He didn't say that for Frenchie Davis, who has been to Broadway. " Contestants who read as gay have be­ come scarce in the current third sea­ son-although that's an admittedly sub­ jective observation, since only one contestant so far, season 1 finalist Jim Verraros, has come out. "When I first au­ ditioned, there were so many, so many gay guys in the top 30," says Verraros, who begins a tour of gay clubs in May and stars in the new gay film festival fa­ vorite Eating Out. "We were definitely the most sexually diverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Absolutely ." Since Verraros's departur e, the only inarguably gay content on Idol has come from the mock gay-baiting between the superstraight Cowell and host Ryan Seacrest , who happily embraces his metrosexuality but says he isn't gay-or from kidding contestants like footballer Matthew Rogers, who sang to Cowell after he was voted off on March 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hay notes that this season also seems "less gay" because women contestants are dominating and the judges rarely sin­ gle out women as "too Broadway." In­ stead, suspender-clad final-32 contestant Briana Ramirez-Rial (also unavailable to The Advocate) got the equivalent of an antilesbian slam when she was deemed too "angry" before getting cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was she not feminine enough? "She looked very butch," Hay agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges' gender standards may be enforced even in preliminaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An openly gay Idol hopeful named David, who sang for an anonymous screening panel at Houston's Minute Maid Park, recalls that he was told "I had an amaz­ ing voice and was very talented-but I needed to work on my 'marketability. '" Leaving the stadium, he says, "I sulked down the dark hallway pondering what 'marketability ' could be, exactly." Would viewers care whether an Idol favorite was gay? British fans don't Will Young, the first winner of the original Pop Idol, revealed that he's gay immedi­ ately after his victory and has since re­ leased two hit albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another u.K. tal­ ent show, Fame Academy, was won by "baby dyke" Alex Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, it's not viewers who would mind, Hay says, "it's the record labels." Many fans, on the other hand, "would find Britney Spears portraying a Lolita when she was under­ age more offensive than if Clay Aiken was openly gay." Aiken has said emphatically that he's straight-and The Advocate has no in­ formation about Lynch's or Ramirez­ Rial's orientation-but Hay speculates that even the teenage Claymates proba­ bly wouldn't mind a gay Idol. "Kids now are more open-minded than their par­ ents or grandparents," she says. "If Clay were gay and came out of the closet, I don't think that would hurt his record sales."
