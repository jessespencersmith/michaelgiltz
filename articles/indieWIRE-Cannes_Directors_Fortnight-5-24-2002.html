(Even if the movies aren't good. al least you know what to expect.) The Directors Fortnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cannes' version of Siamdance , was intended to reject the old guard and champion brash new talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it too takes comfort in the familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence the reappearance of favorites like Catherine Brelilat, Shane Meadows, Lisa Cholodenko and Lynne Ramsay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directors Fortnight kept the faith and, some of the time, its prayers were answered .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not by the sacrilegious Breillat, the French provocateur who co-opened the program with "Sex is Comedy ." The other co-opener was "Matir Moina" (The Clay Bird), the Fortnight's first-ever film from Bangladesh .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By and large, being asked to open or close any program at Cannes is a dubious honor since those films are almost always disappointments .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But these two split the curse. ~'Matir Moina." about the tug between religion and politics in the justÂ­ forming counlly of Bangladesh , got a polite response . "Se~ is Comedy," however, was roundly dismissed .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's based on the filming of Breillars terrific drama "Fat Girl," a movie highlighted by a riveting seduction scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne Pariltaud hltp:f/VMw.indicwirc.comifilmlrcs1ivalslfcs _ 02Cnnncs _020524 _l'onni.h1ml (fitmllJSH) ... v:.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No ~ 'ru .... ...

(Okay, except for that threesome between mom, her rocII singer boyfriend and her son's mousy ftaneae,) Most chalked it up to the sophomore slump and confidenUy await her next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the faithful were rewarded .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oirector Shane Meadows had been championed as a taleflt with his Bob Hoskins boxing flick i_ntyFourSevan " and the follow-up , "A Room for Romeo Bra â€¢â€¢. â€¢ If plOlling you have talent means breaking out of the festival circuit towards a wider an house audience (and it usually should), then Meadows surely lriu~hed with "Once Upon a TIme in the Midland.," a genial charmer about a Scottish thief (Robert c..rtyle) who returns ~ to claim his woman after a job goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ifs an unexpected cross between Ken Loach and Sergio Leone, but Meadows pulls it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the highlight of the Fortnight was Lynne Ram.ayÂ·s triumph, 'Morvem Callar .~ Ramsay trumps her coolly proficient debut, 'Ratcatcher ," and SalT\lnthl Morton's lead performBnce is sure to get end-of-the-year attention from the critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morton plays II young woman wflose boyfriend kills himself on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It proves a marvelous opportunity fur the oddball MOI'IIem to rethink her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramsay won't have 10 rethink hers: !his blackly comic drama is a triumph guaranteed to give her cachet and. if she needs them. bigger budgets down the road. hltp:llwww.indiewire.CQmlfilmlfestivalslfes _02Canne:l_020524Jottni.hlrnl Page 2 of6 NYC AOOTlON : ~M~ NYC ~lmmake "" ",,'" thursdays 6128102 CANNES 2002: Keeping The faith AI Direclors Fortnight Suicide is also the focus of the debut by Mexican director Carlos Reygadu .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His "Japon" (Japan) has been trimmed since its debut in Rotterdam and is the stronger for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disanningly simple, it follows a middle-aged man who heads to a remote village ,where he plans to kill himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Man (a weathered. appealing Alejandro Ferretisj is directed to the bam of a very old peasant named Ascen (Magdalena Flores).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She senses his despair and reaches out as best she can. "Japan" is bold in its design, employing scenes completely devoid of sound and a grand climax with a swir1ing shot of Reygadas boldly stretching out for minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film also features one oHha most awkward sex scenes imaginable. (Flores certainly trumps Kathy Bates in "About Schmidt" for offering the most unexpected nudity.) Also a holdover from another festival, this time Sundance , was "Only the Strong Survive," Roger Friedman's labor of love about soul singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sam Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rufus Thomas and his daughter Carla, Wilaon Pickett, Mary Wilson and the rest are all in fine voice, as evidenced by the too-brief concert footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This amiable, celebratory dOCt.lmentalY, helmed ultimately by Chris Hegedus and D.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pennebaker , seemed right at home in France, which has a long history of recognizing the genius of soul singers and jazz musicians long before Americans do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed. the afternoon crowd I saw it with cheered the film three times: once at the finale. again half.olay during the Cl"edits (simply because they hadn't clapped for a few minutes, I guess) and then again at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If MalY Wilson looked well-preserved, her makeup artists had nothing on the talents of "L'lmbalaamatore" (The Embalmer ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An offbeat Italian romantic drama by Matteo Garrone. its best achievement was creating a believable love triangle between a gay dwarf embalmer , his very tall and handsome assistant, and a beautiful woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Points taken off for leaving the physical aspect of the two men's relationship unnecessarily vague; they won us over emotionally but then chickened out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Italy was less well-represented with the tired drama "Angela." In it, a gangstefs wife falls for her husband's handsome new right-hand man. \NIlen the law comes crashing down. she refuses to tum state's evidence just to keep her affair a secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very noble, until you remember she was intimately involved in a murderous, drug running gang and profited nicely from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's based on a true stOIY. but the characters are so colorless you find it hard to believe. "Mon-Rak Transistor" (A Transistor Love StOlY) from Thailand's Pen-ek Ratanaruang was more original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It starts out as a witty musical about a poor but cute melon farmer who hnp:llwww .indiewire.comifi lmlfestivalslfes_02C annes_020524 _ Fonni.hlml Page3 of6 6r28102 CANNES 2002; Keeping The Faith AI Directors Fortnight loves his girl and wants to be a pop star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The musical interludes are cleverly done and the leads (Suppakom KibJuwan and Sirlakom Pukkavesa) have charm to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the electricity runs low when the movie drops Its light tone and all-out musical numbers for a dour middle half where everything goes wrong for our hero. (And why does he never. ever pick up the phone to call his long-suffering, true love?) It rallies towards the end, but the director will have to trust whatls special about his projects next time around to truly breakout Also quite conventional in the end was "Chlh-yen Vee" (Blue Gate Crossing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Taiwanese film about high school students in love, it features sexual confusion between a handsome swimmer and a pretty girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only surprise for anyone who knows anything about competitive swimmers is that the sexual confusion lies with his girlfriend, who finally admits to a lesbian crush on her best pal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Utterly familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So was "Bord de Mer" (Seaside).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that this French film about a small resort town during several seasons owes a debt to any genre in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just typical of a certain type of French film -not much happens and the sooner you accept \hat, the quicker you'll be able to enjoy whatever slight charms the movie has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Debuting director Julie Lopea-Curval could always discover the appeal of a plot in the future; she already demonstrates a way with actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more familiar to festival-goers was "Le Pays Du Chien Qui Chante" (Land of the Singing Dog).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A drama about a Japanese couple visiting a French village in the mountains , it was given a shrug by almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Yann Oedet has edited films for the likes of Truffaut and Pialat, but unforttJnately his first film is the sort that only e)(ists in the hothouse atmosphere of festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I missed "Abouna" (Our Father). but this drama from Chad was about two brothers who go in search of their missing father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gained little attention, but those who saw it had nice things to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The closing night film, 'Welcome to Collinwood." starring George Clooney, is still to come of course, along with a handful of other movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for now, I'll remember the best two features that pulled together fragments of celluloid. "Voir Biba Braviarlum " was called in English "A Bibo Reader." i foolishly hoped it was actually "A Bilbo Reader" and would contain scenes from Peter Jackson' s upcoming "The hllp:lfwww.indicwire.comlfi lmifesliva lslfes_02ClIIlm:s _020524 _ FOMi.hlml Page 4 of 6 6I2Sf02 CANNES 2002: Keeping The Faith At Directors Fortnight lord of the Ringa: The Two Towers." No such luck, of course, But the next best thing happened : this ode to Hungarian intellectual Istvan Bibo proved very compelling, It pulls together scraps of footage from Hungary -young men wrestling, people canoeing, a group exercising and so on - along with private home movies of Bibo manying and raising his family, This is combined with a British voiceover reading from Bibo's many published essays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find random footage of people in the past oddly compelling - it's like glimpsing through a hole in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bibo's insights into anti-Semitism were a welcome respite from the general tenor of European media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And his comments on how nations give up personal freedoms in times of crisis certainly struck a nerve as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One man in the audience quietly snored at the early screening (what was he expecting?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for those who think they might care, "A Bibo Reader" will send them out to the local bookstore searching for a collection of his woo&lt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the special midnight screening of Â·Poliasona et Gellpettes " proves there is nothing new under the sun and that anything, given enough time, will be of sober, scholarly interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film in question was a compilation of hardcore pornography from the silent era filmed for screening in bordellos .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, no pool boys or pizza deliverymen are involved, but everything else was quite familiar, to the sophisticated amusement of the largely French audience .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naughty nuns, school girls who need a spanking and so on were the familiar setups, with surprisingly explicit scenes to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was hard to be jaded when one set piece involved a bored dog positively dragged into its erotic adventures with both women and a rather bold man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though no directors were identified. some pieces were so well lit and shot it was believed that major talents were sometimes involved in the making of these shorts, most of which were created in the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The capper was an amusing, animated short that was no less bawdy for being a cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ended with our hero finding solace with a very pleased cow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no, the end credits had no disclaimer for the ASPCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FEEDBACK?
