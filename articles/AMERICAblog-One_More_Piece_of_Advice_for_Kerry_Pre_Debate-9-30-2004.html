                <p>T H U R S D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 3 0 , 2 0 0 4One More Piece of Advice for Kerry Pre-Debateby Michael in New York on 9/30/2004 05:00:00 PMOkay, everyone has advice for John Kerry and surely his staffers havestuffed his already-bulging brain with an overload of informationabout catch phrases and taglines and points of attack.Can they fit in one more word? If so, here's one word Kerry shouldarm himself with tonight:AFRAIDAs in Iraq: "We are in a terrible, terrible situation in Iraq and youcan't tackle the problem until you face up to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Bush may beafraid to face the truth, but I'm not."As in firing staffers when they screw up: "George Bush could learnsomething from Donald Trump: the importance of telling staffers whoscrew up -- "You're fired." We've had the worst intelligence failure indecades and George Bush didn't fire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've had a completecollapse of decency in the Abu Ghraib scandal and George Bush didn'tfire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've had a total mess in post-war planning and GeorgeBush didn't fire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, George Bush may be too afraid to firestaffers who let down the American people but I won't be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyonemakes mistakes but if you fail time and time again, you should befired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, George Bush will learn this come November."As in Saudi Arabia: "George Bush says he wants to spread democracyaround the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But who are his allies in that fight? Not Canada orGermany or Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, the countries George Bush is most closelylinked to in this fight are Syria and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syriahas a dreadful record of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pakistan is responsiblefor the spread of nuclear knowledge and material to more roguenations and more terrorist groups than Iraq ever was."And Saudi Arabia...[pause as he grasps the shame of it] SaudiArabia is a corrupt and cruel monarchy that keeps its womenenslaved under the most dreadful conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia stifles anydissent and spends its wealth on spreading terrorism and hatred ofthe US throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But George Bush and his father andtheir family have worked hand in hand with Saudi Arabia his entireadult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've made millions of dollars together for themselvesand their companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Bush and his family consider thesepeople their dearest friends and George Bush has always been tooafraid to denounce the Saudi government for what it is: the enemyof freedom and the enemy of its own people."I doubt George Bush will find the courage tonight to face the truthabout the corrupt Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if he does, it will be the firsttime in his life that he's ever done so."AFRAID.It will push George Bush's buttons and it's a defining characteristicfor him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to fight in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to try and succeed on hisown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to fire employees who don't do their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to backdown to the religious right and turning on the children of his vicepresident instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AFRAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That one word will either make himfurious or make him stumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either way, we win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you can worryabout Saudi Arabia later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've got no where else to turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...7 minutes agoFiredoglakeSave American Jobs: Close Your Chase Account -JP Morgan Chase refuses to do what it takes tosave 300,000 jobs and the healthcare of 700,000retirees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I decided today to no longer be a partof that....32 minutes agoDaily Kos"Difference isn't a threat" - Dave Neiwert, theblogosphere's leading expert on the eliminationistmovement, has a typically excellent post about theweekend's tragic shooting at Croo...39 minutes agoEschatonDeep Thought - Why is Chris Hayes always on myteevee?42 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All www.MoneyAndMarkets.comFeedback - Ads by Google AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: One M...http://www.americablog.com/2004/09/one-more-piece-of-advic... 1 of 64/6/09 10:12 PM</p>
