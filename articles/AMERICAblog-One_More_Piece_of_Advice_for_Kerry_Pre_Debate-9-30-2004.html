If so, here's one word Kerry shouldarm himself with tonight:AFRAIDAs in Iraq: "We are in a terrible, terrible situation in Iraq and youcan't tackle the problem until you face up to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Bush may beafraid to face the truth, but I'm not."As in firing staffers when they screw up: "George Bush could learnsomething from Donald Trump: the importance of telling staffers whoscrew up -- "You're fired." We've had the worst intelligence failure indecades and George Bush didn't fire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've had a completecollapse of decency in the Abu Ghraib scandal and George Bush didn'tfire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've had a total mess in post-war planning and GeorgeBush didn't fire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, George Bush may be too afraid to firestaffers who let down the American people but I won't be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyonemakes mistakes but if you fail time and time again, you should befired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, George Bush will learn this come November."As in Saudi Arabia: "George Bush says he wants to spread democracyaround the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But who are his allies in that fight? Not Canada orGermany or Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, the countries George Bush is most closelylinked to in this fight are Syria and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syriahas a dreadful record of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pakistan is responsiblefor the spread of nuclear knowledge and material to more roguenations and more terrorist groups than Iraq ever was."And Saudi Arabia...[pause as he grasps the shame of it] SaudiArabia is a corrupt and cruel monarchy that keeps its womenenslaved under the most dreadful conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Arabia stifles anydissent and spends its wealth on spreading terrorism and hatred ofthe US throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But George Bush and his father andtheir family have worked hand in hand with Saudi Arabia his entireadult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've made millions of dollars together for themselvesand their companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Bush and his family consider thesepeople their dearest friends and George Bush has always been tooafraid to denounce the Saudi government for what it is: the enemyof freedom and the enemy of its own people."I doubt George Bush will find the courage tonight to face the truthabout the corrupt Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if he does, it will be the firsttime in his life that he's ever done so."AFRAID.It will push George Bush's buttons and it's a defining characteristicfor him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to fight in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to try and succeed on hisown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to fire employees who don't do their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afraid to backdown to the religious right and turning on the children of his vicepresident instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AFRAID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That one word will either make himfurious or make him stumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either way, we win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you can worryabout Saudi Arabia later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've got no where else to turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...7 minutes agoFiredoglakeSave American Jobs: Close Your Chase Account -JP Morgan Chase refuses to do what it takes tosave 300,000 jobs and the healthcare of 700,000retirees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I decided today to no longer be a partof that....32 minutes agoDaily Kos"Difference isn't a threat" - Dave Neiwert, theblogosphere's leading expert on the eliminationistmovement, has a typically excellent post about theweekend's tragic shooting at Croo...39 minutes agoEschatonDeep Thought - Why is Chris Hayes always on myteevee?42 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All www.MoneyAndMarkets.comFeedback - Ads by Google AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: One M...http://www.americablog.com/2004/09/one-more-piece-of-advic... 1 of 64/6/09 10:12 PM</p>
