Well, duh -- becausethey're so much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Answer me this: why do so many people waste time just streaming and renting andbuying any ole new release whose title rings a bell (because it was advertised over and over) rather thanwatching a classic film? You know most new releases will be just ok, at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know most classics areclassics because they're really really good! So enough! If you enjoy the genres these films come from, you oweit to yourself to watch them today.It Happened One Night is the original, the prototypical road trip movie in which a mismatched couple fights andfalls in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They did it here first, to massive acclaim and Oscar success and boy does it stand the test of time.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are a treat as a tough talking newspaper man out for a scoop and a spoiledheiress running away from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a hit during the last Depression and it's just as fun to watch during thisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one presents classic films with more care than Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looks great, of course, and the extras includea feature length documentary on director Frank Capra, a restored version of his first short, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisisn't homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you liked The Sure Thing with John Cusack, this is the film they were following in thefootsteps of (or should that be tire tracks?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wait, you haven't seen The Sure Thing either? I give up!Romance is an enduring theme in movies and so are corrupt politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are always blooming too, at leastin DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best thing about 2014 was that it was the 75th anniversary of 1939, giving a bunch of studios anexcuse to put out new editions of a clutch of masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even in that vintage year, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith Goes ToWashington stands tall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It manages to be cynical and optimistic at the same time, no small feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jimmy Stewartis genuinely inspiring as a regular guy who tries to do good (Barack Obama probably watches this flick to cheerhimself up) and Jean Arthur is every bit as good as the hardened politico who softens her heart for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andwhat a finale! This restoration looks stunning, by the way and also includes new interviews about the film and adocumentary.Bernardo Bertolucci made many significant films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't think any of them looked more beautiful than thegorgeous masterpiece The Conformist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean-Louis Trintignant is remarkable as a man compromised into terrible12/16/2015DVDs: The Greatest Road Trip Movie of All, Loads of Boxed Sets for Gift-Giving and More | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=240bf041-cb17-40b6-9f13-d793f3117c2a&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/5deeds by the corrupt world he lives in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do the visuals overwhelm this dark tale? No, they underline and mockand make clear the constantly alluring temptation to just go along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This restoration also looks terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It isavailable on DVD, but I'll never speak to you again if you don't watch it on BluRay.Enough with the heavy fare! Director Terry Gilliam was already in the pantheon for being a part of MontyPython's Flying Circus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this charming solo debut married the daft sensibility of that troupe with thedangerous charm of a fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time Bandits is a trippy, positively head-spinning look at a child who goestraipsing through time, from Robin Hood to the Titanic to ancient Greece and into a final battle against theSupreme Being. (Not in that order.) While fans of Python should be first in line (and have already seen it, I'msure), this is Gilliam's most broadly appealing film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the folks at Criterion are only human and have once in agreat while been tripped up by circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody's perfect! They once released a version of this film onDVD that was not up to their standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, they've more than made up for that here with this spotless editionthat takes me back to my first experience with this film in the movie theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All is forgiven!Classics aren't just noble fare or meta adventures, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes they're just downright spooky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check outthe silent masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caligari, a German creepfest about a traveling circus and asleepwalker who is apparently up to no good in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You realize how timidly realistic most movies are todaywhen you see this: it employs highly stylized sets, costumes and makeup that leap into your imagination withcreepy ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, this restoration is terrific; the combination of BluRay with 4-K restoration and the carededicated companies now pay to their movies (because people will kvetch if they don't) mean we're seeingmany movies in better shape than they've been since their premiere, if ever.THE JEFFERSONS COMPLETE SERIES ($229.99 DVD; Shout) MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ED THE COMPLETE SERIES ($139.99 DVD; Shout) JEEVES AND WOOSTER COMPLETE COLLECTION ($59.99 DVD; Acorn)The boxed sets keep coming! Sitcoms tend not to play as well in big gulps the way serialized dramas do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butbefore all movies and TV shows enter the cloud and become available in a constant stream forever, it's nice tocollect and make a statement about the shows you love or just really want to be able to watch without having tofigure out where they're streaming and when a particular season is in rotation.I grew up with The Jeffersons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long before The Cosby Show, this Norman Lear produced comedy showed anaffluent African American family happily ensconced on the Upper East Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, rather than being matter offact like Cosby's set-up, the mere fact that they were movin' on up was the raison d'etre for this show. (Heck, it'seven in the theme song.) But that lasted for about two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They pushed buttons over mixed race couplesand clash of cultures all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But George Jefferson was a smart, hard-working businessman who enjoyedhis power and privilege, his wife Louise had the gracious manner of a hostess (without forgetting her roots) andMother Jefferson sure liked her medicinal drinks, just like the Queen Mother at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They had a servant andshe may have had a sharp tongue, but servant she was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this would matter except the show had a verystrong ensemble of actors, led by Sherman Hemsley, Isabel Sanford and Marla Gibbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would have sworn upand down Gibbs had won an Emmy, but only Sanford did, in a rare but well-deserved win for an actress of color.They all elevated the rather pedestrian scripts the show eventually sank into once it ran out of steam onrace/class/culture jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a smash hit on the premiere CBS lineup of Saturday night and then fell hardonce it was jerked around the schedule, before climbing back into the Top 10 once it was ensconced onSundays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then they moved it again and pulled the plug unceremoniously after 11 seasons without a propergoodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one would make that mistake today and why CBS didn't make amends and score ratings byreuniting them for a farewell special is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can celebrate this significant if not great show bydiving into this set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if your back seizes up after sitting and watching so many episodes, I'd be glad to walkon it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am British, after all.Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ed is really nonsense, one of those silly shows that makes you just shake your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It lasted for 14312/16/2015DVDs: The Greatest Road Trip Movie of All, Loads of Boxed Sets for Gift-Giving and More | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=240bf041-cb17-40b6-9f13-d793f3117c2a&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/5episodes? Really? Interestingly ,it's one of the few shows to leap from syndication into primetime on a majornetwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The concept was based on stories by Walter R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooks, more fondly remembered for the Freddy ThePig books, though this was where the money was at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The horse talked, the human Wilbur listened andaudiences laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It certainly didn't hurt that the show boasted one of the catchiest theme songs in history.(See, you're singing it now.) Presumably only people who grew up with the show or its reruns will be interested.But here's the entire show presented with care by Shout. (And no, they didn't use peanut butter to make thehorse move its mouth; it was prompted to at first and then just learned what was needed and did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's evenmore remarkable to me.)For a comedy show that has in fact endured and looks better with each passing year, check out Jeeves &amp;Wooster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you only know Hugh Laurie from House, you'll be astonished at how well he plays a dimwit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If youonly know Stephen Fry from whatever one of his many wonderful ventures you know Stephen Fry, well you'll fallin love with him again as the unflappable Jeeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tales by PG Wodehouse are wonderfully silly and thisseries is the ideal presentation of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be honest, earlier editions of this series on DVD have looked merelyok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's done right.AMERICAN MASTERS: BING CROSBY -- REDISCOVERED ($24.99 DVD; PBS)You can argue till you're blue in the face about the most talented performer in history. (It often comes down to abattle royal between Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr. -- those two could do it all!) But when it comes to thebiggest star of all time, I've always argued for Bing Crosby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one has ever dominated the way he did in somany different arenas at one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing was for a number of years the biggest movie star in the world (and anOscar winner to boot).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Going My Way is a classic and the Road movies with Bob Hope remain an indelible andunique contribution (and very funny).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing was also the biggest radio star in the world, which is akin to havingthe #1 TV show today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing was ALSO the most successful recording artist of all time, by many standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hislist of #1 records stretching out over decades and decades, the voice behind the biggest single of all time("White Christmas," perhaps supplanted in sales but not in enduring popularity) and easily one of the mostinfluential singers of them all -- his legacy is unquestioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing also delivered a string of highly rated TVspecials (though never with the regularity or impact of Hope).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So consider me astonished that anyone wouldever suggest Bing Crosby was in danger of being forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, I even had a screenplay about a young manobsessed with Crosby who would get in a fight with anyone that suggested Frank Sinatra was a better singer.(Shockingly, it was never optioned.) This American Masters special reintroduces us to Crosby and does a solidjob of explaining just how massively successful he was in his day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also go to the experts like Gary Giddinsand Michael Feinstein to explain what a remarkable talent he was as a singer (the area where his true artistrylies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in his innovations like pre-recording a radio show and how that led to new recording techniques andeventually the cassette and you've got a fascinating tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found this American Masters documentary to bemerely so-so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being a return visit to Crosby, I was looking for some genuine new insight rather than a run-downof the usual facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They might have done better to focus in strictly on his singing and recording career, sincethat's the work that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for those who know little or nothing about Crosby, this does a decent taskof detailing the remarkable career of one of the giants of pop culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then you can dive into some of hisgreat music and realize how amazing he truly is.GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY ($39.99 BluRay 3-D multipack; Disney) THE 100 FOOT JOURNEY ($36.99 BluRay; Disney) NYMPHOMANIAC DIRECTOR'S CUT I AND II ($39.98 BluRay; Magnolia)OK, you need a gift? This grab-bag of titles is sure to include something that will appeal to 90% of the adults onyour list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, it's not about what you like, it's about what they will like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guardians of the Galaxy is aloopy, fun comic book romp of a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has the same appeal as the late, beloved TV series Firefly (but isn'tremotely in that category of goodness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have every confidence the sequel will be much better, but this is pretty12/16/2015DVDs: The Greatest Road Trip Movie of All, Loads of Boxed Sets for Gift-Giving and More | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=240bf041-cb17-40b6-9f13-d793f3117c2a&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;4/5fun to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it has an awesomely odd, mixtape of a soundtrack to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teens, adults who love sci-fi,comic book fanatics (they're not just males, you know) will all be happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 100 Foot Journey is also aproblematic movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's dependably sweet and sure to appeal to any fans of Helen Mirren or cooking shows.That should cover pretty much anyone over 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you need something dark and edgy, why notshock or amuse someone with Nymphomaniac? No, it's not suitable for sharing with the family on ChristmasDay but it will be a showstopper of a stocking stuffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you can debate which actor would need the biggeststocking, given its explicit nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie is a lot talkier and funnier and at least attempts something deep.Someone on your list think they're arty? Give 'em this and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because sometimes it's not whatthey want, it's what you want to see them open.LOONEY TUNES PLATINUM COLLECTION VOL. 3 ($44.98 BluRay; Warner Bros.) KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE ($36.99 BluRay combo; Disney) THE WIND RISES ($36.99 BluRay combo; Disney)I know some people say they don't like "cartoons." Truly! I don't trust or like such people and you should keepthem out of your life if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether it's classic shorts, overseas gems or new boundary pushingworks, animation is a source of endless pleasure to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Looney Tunes shorts, led by Bugs Bunny ofcourse, emblazoned on the minds of most kids how very funny, mature, adult and just plain silly cartoons couldbe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This third BluRay set contains one disc devoted to Bugs and another disc devoted to various and sundrytalents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find dependable fun here, though of course this stuff has been packaged and repackaged manytimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look elsewhere for more definitive collections of the greatest hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you're a fan and want to addvariety to your collection, this is a fine addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Hayao Miyazakis is of course a master of animation.Kiki's Delivery Service is one of his gems that was created before most people in the West realized what agenius was in our midst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you probably haven't seen this tale of a young girl who sets out in the world to proveher independence and become accepted as a full-fledged witch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miyazaki's probable swan song asa director is The Wind Rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is more of a film for adults (though there's nothing shocking or explicit thatteens and younger kids can't handle.) It's a classic melodrama about a young engineer who loves engineeringmachines but finds himself creating airplanes to help in the destructive battles of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just happens tobe animated but could easily have been live action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, Miyazaki takes full advantage of the medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anearthquake is a showstopper and the scenes of flight both real and imagined are breathtakingly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itsvisuals tie directly into the themes that have threaded through all his movies from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far from jingoistic,it's rather sad and beautifully muted, from the gorgeous artwork to the inevitable pop ballad over the closingcredits.PORTRAIT OF JASON ($39.95 BluRay; Milestone) ORNETTE: MADE IN AMERICA ($39.95 BluRay; Milestone)Can someone please tell the late director Shirley Clarke that we're finally catching up with her artistry? Thesetwo releases debuting on BluRay are just the tip of the iceberg for this talented trailblazer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're alsoessential works in both musical films and independent cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clarke toyed with the limitations and strengths ofcinema verite throughout her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she never did so more successfully than with Portrait Of Jason, a lookat the most invisible person one could imagine in 1966: a black, gay, male prostitute in the West Village of NewYork City back when being gay was illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason holds forth in an interview/performance that is bothconfessional and over-the-top, truthful and fanciful in fascinating ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a landmark work with loads ofinteresting extras, like further snippets of Jason including Jason in color (!) and even a complete audio recordingof his Christmas album, which is surely for fanatics only.Near the end of her career, Clarke also made an impressionistic film about the jazz legend Ornette Coleman.This has everything: found footage, interviews, reenactments of his life, and dazzling concert footage -- all of itedited with bebop fervor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's mesmerizing, especially for fans of jazz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's much more to come on BluRay12/16/2015DVDs: The Greatest Road Trip Movie of All, Loads of Boxed Sets for Gift-Giving and More | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=240bf041-cb17-40b6-9f13-d793f3117c2a&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;5/5from this Academy Award winning director (for a documentary about Robert Frost I've never seen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thesetwo films are a great start.THE ANGELS' SHARE ($24.98 DVD; MPI) LEVITATED MASS ($27.95 DVD out 12-16; First Run)Ken Loach has just about ended his career as a director of fictional films. (He's still got some unfinishedbusiness in documentaries apparently.) One of his last works proves one of his larkiest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Angels' Share is acaper film about a group of misfits who plan to steal the "angels' share" of some wildly expensive whiskey aboutto be auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the perfect crime because the angels' share is the portion of whiskey that evaporateswhile it's been aged, so no one will miss a few extra pints, right? Loach maintains his unblinking eye on outcastsand the working poor, but never loses his grim sense of humor and empathy for life, however hardscrabble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sfar from one of his best but it's sweet and -- for this old puss -- a bit of a surprise.Finally, Levitated Mass doesn't come out till next week (12-16) but since it's a real gem, it's worth mentioningnow in the last regular column of the year. (I'll have a best of the year column soon.) Tragically, it didn't makethe short list of documentaries eligible for the Oscar last year, but it definitely has the critical acclaim deservingof one of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Doug Pray tells of the amusingly drawn-out 40+ years it took toinstall a piece of artwork by Michael Heizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since that artwork involved a 300+ ton granite boulder travelingmore than 100 miles and then being installed in mid-air where visitors could walk under and around it, that'sperhaps not such a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love large works like this (head to Dia Beacon in New York State if you ever can;most museums can't even accommodate such works while Dia specializes in them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I never gave muchthought to how those pieces actually get into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Levitated Mass uses that tale to explore the idea of what isartwork, the career of a fascinating artist and the almost comical journey of a really big rock.Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a websitethat lets you browse for books online the way you do in a physical bookstore, provides comprehensive info onnew releases every week in every category and offers passionate personal recommendations every step of theway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a fall book preview or holiday gift guide -- but every week in every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also the cohost ofShowbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the dayand features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz athis website and his daily blog.Note: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-rays with the understanding that he would beconsidering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does not guarantee to review and he receives far more titles than hecan cover.</p>
