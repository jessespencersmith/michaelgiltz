DEAR EVAN HANSEN : THROUGH THE WINDOW BOOKFILTER’S BOOK GUIDE FOR THEATER BUFFS MICHAEL GILTZ | NOVEMBER 20, 2017 SHARE By Steven Levenson, Benji Pasek &amp; Justin Paul $40, Grand Central PublishingWith the remarkable success of a behind-the-scenes coffee-table book for Hamilton, you can now expect any show that captures lightning in a bottle to publish the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First up? The acclaimed musical Dear Evan Hansen .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as its Tony-winning lead, Ben Platt, takes his final bow, the creators have produced a collectible keepsake that charts the nearly decade-long journey of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes photos, an exploration ofEvan Hansen’s fictional world, and, of course, the full libretto make this ideal for passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALANCING ACTS By Nicholas Hytner $28.95, KnopfNicholas Hytner is an exemplary theater director, having helmed everything from Miss Saigon to a brilliant revival of Carousel to the film version of The Crucible when he took charge ofLondon’s National Theatre from 2003 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This diary offers blow-by-blow details of what thatrole actually means, from budget meetings to casting calls and supporting talent to raisingmoney and bemoaning the busker who stands in front of the theatre playing one song — poorly— over and over again throughout Hytner’s reign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The forward alone is worth the price ofadmission and should be anthologized by anyone wishing to illustrate the frenzied 1,001 claimson the time of an administrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you were lucky enough to be in London and see some of thetriumphs he backed, this memoir is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anyone fascinated by the compromises andcreativity in putting on a single show, much less an entire season at the National, with all itsmoving parts and various stages to be filled, will be in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANNA ZIEGLER: PLAYS ONE By Anna Ziegler $30.95, Oberon BooksPlaywright Anna Ziegler has seen Nicole Kidman star in her play Photograph 51 in London’s West End.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In New York City today, she is the rare dramatist to have two new plays appearing attwo separate spaces at the same time: The Last Match and Actually .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And her play Boy was named by Huffington Post as one of the best dramas of 2016. (OK, it was me saying that at Huffington Post.) With a clutch of film and TV projects along with commissions for new plays,Ziegler is clearly one to reckon with, and this collection of four dramas is very much the first ofwhat promises to be many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains Photograph 51 , The Last Match , A Delicate Ship, and Boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUICK CURTAIN By Alan Melville $12.95, Poisoned Pen PressThis dishy satire of the theater world and the mystery novel was first published in 1934.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You wouldn’t know it from the timeless characters on tap — including producer Douglas B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas(the impresario capitalizing on a sudden death some 20 years before fellow producer DavidMerrick first appeared on the scene), a starlet who entertains more people at her home than onstage, an unflappable stagehand named Robert, and a critic who writes his reviews beforeseeing a production because all shows are the same — just stuff and nonsense from start tofinish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is set in London, where the leading man is murdered on stage in front of anopening-night audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Egads! Devotees of the Great White Way will love the rabid fans whodescend on a funeral like locusts, and egotistical stars on the rise and fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equally fun isMelville’s tweaking of the conventions of the crime novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has a police detective living inluxury à la Lord Peter Wimsey; said detective’s son working for a lark at a newspaper; and somany clues and twists and turns that we guarantee you won’t figure out whodunit or why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, really, you won’t, because the last thing Melville was interested in was playing fair and giving you all the clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He pulls out the rug from under us in a farcical finale filled with a flurry ofletters and telegrams and confessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you need the perfect stocking stuffer for StephenSondheim, this is it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only real surprise is that this goof has apparently never been staged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIFE IS LIKE A MUSICAL By Tim Federle $18, Running PressThe super-famous Tim Federle has written a string of bestselling novels for kids and young adults, including Better Nate Than Never, that make valentines to musical theater seempositively mean-spirited in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s also written the book for the Tony-nominatedmusical Tuck Everlasting , danced in shows, written goofy recipe books for cocktail enthusiasts, and accomplished about a thousand other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How does he do it all? He’s glad you asked!Federle’s guide to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tickets to the latest Broadway hit shares the tipshe learned while doing everything from being one of a thousand people performing at the SuperBowl halftime show to playing a polar bear at Radio City Music Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’ll tell you how to win atlife and love with 50 tips on treating every day as a musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don’t have to be a musicaltheater fanatic to benefit from his wisdom … but why would you not be a musical theaterfanatic? This book is perfect for anyone who knows all the words to all the songs in all theirfavorite shows.SUGAR, BUTTER, FLOUR: THE WAITRESS PIE BOOK By Jenna Hunterson $25, Pam Krauss/Avery Pop star Jason Mraz has just joined the hit Broadway musical Waitress .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Hallberg dances again, of course, as aprincipal at the American Ballet Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also mentors boys who might be drawn to dance,via a scholarship, and encourages new choreographers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From a childhood of bullying to thepeak of the dance world, Hallberg has already a body of work that is impressive, one that willspeak to anyone pursuing a life of creativity or simply searching for inspiration from someonewho has pushed to pursue the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Esmerelda, the newest star of the Russian Mouse BalletCompany, must keep everyone’s tails untangled as they rehearse the piece and wonder if anyother mice will bother to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And their human friend, Irina — the 9-year-old daughter of thetheatre’s custodian — must make sure the entire company is wiped out as vermin before theirdancing abilities can be seen and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Not because it’s so long, but because every time he talks about an album,you can’t help but cue up a CD or download it on a streaming app and listen to it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You’llrevisit classics like Frank Sinatra’s “In The Wee Small Hours” and Louis Armstrong’s “MeetsOscar Peterson,” and undoubtedly check out some great albums you’ve never heard before.The excuse for all this fun is a sort of desert-island-discs roundup of Friedwald’s favorites, fromCarmen McRae and Ella Fitzgerald to offbeat choices like Tiny Tim (!) and Della Reese’scontribution to the Latin craze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Artist to artist, Friedwald varies his insights, exploring thethumbnail sketches of their careers; the songwriters an artist worked with; the cheapskatemanagers who hurt their album productions (Armstrong was usually asked to record late at nightafter doing a full concert); and the perennial mystery of why Doris Day is underappreciated byso many, starting with Day herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since so many of these albums draw upon the GreatAmerican Songbook, you’re learning about Gershwin and Porter and Berlin and so many otherBroadway gems — as sung by the most celebrated artists on some of the best albums of alltime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

You can catch Rudetsky’s videos on his website,hear him on the Sirius XM Broadway channel, and now with this book, you can put him underthe tree or the menorah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfect for anyone, as the theater jack-of-all-trades would tell youhimself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

But having an entire decade in one volume makeshis journey all the more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covering 2005 to 2015, this edition features Bennett workingon the premieres of four new plays, film versions of The History Boys and The Lady in the Van (both disappointments), and all the daily drudgery he covers with such verve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
