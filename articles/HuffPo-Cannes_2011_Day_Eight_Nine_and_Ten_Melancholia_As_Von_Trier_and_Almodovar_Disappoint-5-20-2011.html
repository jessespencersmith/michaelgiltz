Unlike so many of his filmsboth good and bad, this one wasn't controversial orshocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the world was about to end in a few days,how would you spend your final hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Von Trier oddlychose to spend it with a handful of deeply uninteresting,self-involved rich people on a private estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A "rogue"planet from outside our solar system (or just "hiding" behind the sun all these millennia), is on a trajectory to pass right by earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists say we're safe while many others see disaster in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Melancholia begins at the end with the planet smashing into our home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first five or so minutes are filled with some stunning, sharply original images of our destruction set to the music of Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see a bride running down a field, a mother clutching her sonto her chest, the moment of impact itself from a vantage point just past the moon and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's athrilling, memorable montage that nothing else in the movie comes close to matching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We then flashback MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Anthony Weiner Admits Sending Racy Pictures, Refuses To Resign New Photos Emerge In Anthony Weiner Twitter Scandal FOLLOW US PHOTOS: Who Won Big At This Year's 'Fashion Oscars'?Michelle Obama Wears Naeem Khan To State Dinner Nancy Pelosi Wears Vintage Thierry Mugler To 7 Sites You Should Be Wasting Time On Right NowBIG NEWS: Movies Celebrity Body The Kardashians Katy Perry Smarter Ideas More Log in | Sign Up News Web NSFW PHOTO: Rooney Mara Goes NUDE In 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' Poster Zach Galifianakis Reveals Major Details From Third 'Hangover' Film, Disses Ke$ha Bad Guy?

THE SKIN I LIVE IN ** out of **** Usually, reading the book a movie is based on can help me see what attracted the filmmaker to the story and illuminate why he or she made the choices they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, reading the novel Mygale by Thierry Jonquet might have been a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was thrown for a loop by all the shifts in perspectiveand it may take a second viewing for me to get my bearings on the latest from Pedro Almodovar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's aserious melodrama filled with noir-ish twists and turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Antonio Banderas is a plastic surgeon with abeautiful woman kept prisoner in his home while he works on softening her skin ever more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throw intothe mix a maid who is also (unknown to him) Banderas' mother, a thuggish brother, a mentally derangeddaughter, sex, violence, rape and numerous flashbacks and you've got a seriously potent mix for thriller.Aolmodovar made numerous smart changes to the story of the book,making the tale both (slightly) lesstwisted and definitely more believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for me those positive changes can't erase the fact that the plottwists are so rapid and over-the-top that I kept wishing Almodovar would embrace the telenovela-ness ofhis movies recently rather than play them so straight-faced and serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THIS MUST BE THE PLACE *** The Twitter Typo That Exposed Weiner Engadget: WWDC 2011 liveblog: Steve Jobs talks iOS 5, OS X Lion, iCloud and more!

Mon dieu! Everyone seemed to think this was common in the US but a first for France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I pointed out that to my knowledge, the only time a fictional film had been made about a sitting President was Oliver Stone's W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did read Sarkozy's self-serving, dull-ish political tract Testimony to get an idea of the man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I needn't have bothered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hunger for power and the self-serving behavior of politicians is universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This moviebegins on the day Sarkozy is elected to the head of France and flashes back to his years in the Cabinetand slow but sure rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It probably won't translate for US audiences, even though it's light on itsfeet and pretty amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Denis Podalydes as Sarkozy kept reminding me of the UK's Tony Blair, or apitbull as he doggedly walked down the hallways of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bernard Le Coq was especially amusingas Jacques Chirac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The score is a major plus as you can tell from this trailer, which includes a few cursewords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Politicians!
