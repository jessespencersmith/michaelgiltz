(They should have tied into the theme of birthdays and done one from Ryan's year of 1974 instead.) No one stood outexcept for the dorky chest-bumping of Michael Johns and David Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We found out they keep the number of downloads on iTunes a secret each week so seeing how popular some singers are doesn't influence the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cruelly, we see Brooke recording her tune andbeing told by a producer to "watch your pitch!" Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kimberly Locke had a solid debut album buttook years to record a followup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During that time she opened a restaurant, lost weight and seemsrelatively balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved her debut single "Eighth World Wonder" and her new tune "Fall" ain'tup to that standard but it's fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dolly Parton is the mentor next week (I couldn't be more excited)and they take those stupid calls again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bottom Three -- It's Chikezie, Syesha (!) andJason Castro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only one I got right was Chikezie,proving yet again that I am way off base this seasonin predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason is the first to be safe, leavingSyesha and Chikezie, disproving those who look forblock voting and figured the remaining two blackcontestants would get enough support for at least one of them to stay safe(r).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly the Filipino vote is on heavy speed-dial for Ramiele who was theworst last week by a mile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But frankly, with 30 million votes cast, it doesn't matter what contingentyou have supporting you (evangelical, country, etc.), unless your initials are "D" and "A" you needto appeal to Middle America to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, seeing Syesha in the bottom three when she was easily one of the two or three best last night is shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beware the power of Simon, who has been down on her for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the one America listens to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorry Randy and Paula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank goodness Chikezie is sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe this wasn't his week (I thought he'd be in the bottom two, though so Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

BELOW IS MY INITIAL RUNDOWN OF THE PERFORMANCE SHOW ON TUESDAY Now we're at the Top 10 -- the ten singers who know they'll be going on tour and now are quietlythinking to themselves, "Hey, I could WIN this!" According to the judges, we had four greatperformances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to me, two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramiele Malubay -- The theme of the night is songs from the year you were born, which meant an official rush on 1987, beginning with Ramiele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sang Heart's "Alone," the biggest hit of the band's career (by far) which was #1 for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dressed as if it were 1982 and she were singing a song from Flashdance , Ramiele had an off-the-shoulder sweatshirt sort of top and pummeled the song into submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The slow moment at the beginning wasn't bad and the end was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was screeching in the middle and the highlight clip at the end of the show did her no favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three judges were negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon was technically right in pointing out that it was better than last week but probably wrong when he said being better than the week before (when she was awful) means Ramiele should be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't work like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People rarely give you a storehouse of good will once it gets down to the nitty gritty (unless your initials are "D" and "A").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Castro -- He glided through Sting's "Fragile," a mellow sensitive number from 1987 that is right in Jason's wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was never a single, but it's a classic track from Sting's best solo album ...Nothing Like The Sun .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a great choice for Jason, who sits down, strums away at his guitar and shows off some Spanish (or was it Portuguese?) to go along with the French from Beatles week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Definitely working the international tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, his voice almost disappears and he's still singing out of the side of his mouth, but a good performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy and Paula are mixed and Simon is negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy says Jason didn't do anything with the vocals since he's never happy when people just deliver the song rather than throwing in runs and trills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon says it sounds like someone busking in a subway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, but someone good who would make you stop and listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wisely, Jason doesn't talk back or comment while the judges are talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I swear, if Joao Gilberto were a contestant, they'd say, "Another bossa nova? Come on, mix it up, dude." Jason is wise to do what he does best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go down swinging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My only concern is that many people might not know the song, even though it's becoming a standard in the jazz world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha Mercado -- Sings the Gladys Knight and the Pips 1971 classic "If I Were Your Woman," which was covered by Stephanie Mills on her album of the same name in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 'fro is back, the big earrings are in place and Syesha tops last week's peak cover of "Yesterday" with a sensationalperformance that is controlled and passionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've had a crush on her from the start and she'sfinally coming through and coming into her own at just the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the real KellyClarkson -- someone who was overlooked repeatedly but keeps improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now let's see her do itagain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges all rave, though Simon is ever so slightly less rave-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chikezie -- If Ramiele was the weakest, Chikezie is the most forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Born in 1985, he covers a Luther Vandross gem, "If Only For One Night." His voice wavers a bit, he's very rough on the last line and it's rather dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was right to sing a ballad -- don't kick yourself for losing when youdidn't do what you really wanted; accept losing when you went with your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And another manicsong would have been awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges run the gamut, with Randy negative, Paula positive andSimon mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't remember the performance as soon as it's over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke White -- Born in 1983, Brooke sings the massive Police hit "Every Breath You Take," which was their only #1 hit but at least they made the most of it: it was #1 for eight weeks and virtually inescapable for about a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, Brooke thinks it's a love song instead of a song of suspicion and paranoia, which keeps her from really burrowing into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wisely she sits at the piano and sings it, first solo and then with the band kicking in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She gets complimented for screwing up and starting over (You're human! We love you!) and criticized for having the band join in halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, if she'd stayed with just the piano, the judges might have criticized her for NOT having the band joining in and insisting it was dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because what they're really sayingis that it wasn't a very good performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Competent and colorless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, she won't stop talkingwhen the judges offer their critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're mixed, with Randy negative, Paula positive and Simonmixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy's latest verbal tic is to say it was a "very interesting song choice." Really? One of thebiggest hits of all time that works right into her singer-songwriter vein? Michael Johns -- Born in 1978, Michael does a medley of the Queen double-a side hit "We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions," the greatest future-sports-standard single of all time, though itonly hit #4 on the pop charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "We Will Rock You" half is very anonymous and you notice the "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

Bonnie Tyler is the only person to be a one hit wonder twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First she did it in 1978 with the country-ish tune "It's A Heartache," which hit #3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she came back five years later with acomplete makeover musically, really seeming like an entirely different person, thanks to the ktichensink production of producer Jim Steinman (of Meat Loaf fame) who gave her this #1 hit whichstayed on top for four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly has serious heels on and lays into the tune, even doing a writhing sort of motion as she really gets into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly spot on, with a weak final flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy again says it was a "very interesting song choice." Really, I say again? A massive smash hit that lets Carly brandish that big voice? He insists it's really too rock and out of her comfort zone stylistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges are mixed again with Randy negative, Paula positive and Simon mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta -- Born in 1990, David digs up Aussie singer John Farnham's "You're The Voice," which scraped into the Hot 100 that year, was a solid Top 10 hit in the UK, and a massive hit in Australia, where it appeared in 1986 on the best-selling album in Aussie history. (Farnham also sang with Little River Band.) Simon insisted David couldn't possibly have picked this song himself, but David being the pro that he is just said it was a terrific song and that John Farnham is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike the Beatles song, he certainly seemed familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A more lively upbeat tune, "You're The Voice" is still "inspirational," which is the house where David lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He bounces back and forth, tries to keep his diva hands under control and does a credible, decent performance of a song almost no one watching has ever heard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not great, he has a rough patch and loses his voice for a moment but he ends very strongly on a big Idol note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges are positive but it's not the usual Archuleta slam dunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee Cook -- Born in 1984, Kristy chooses the Lee Greenwood flag-waver "God Bless The USA," which is inextricably linked with Reagan's America in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She gets giant American flags waving in the background, a big brass arrangement and delivers her best performance ever!!Though it's still pretty anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, if you can't sing "Amazing Grace" every week, this is yournext best bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next week: the national anthem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, she really does fine and though bothRandy and Paula caution her about pitch, she sounds on key to me the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I just dareanyone to kick her off the show after singing this song! It would be like booing the beauty pageantcontestant who waves the flag while twirling a baton and holding up sparklers on the Fourth ofJuly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insanely, the judges compliment Kristy on such a savvy, clever song choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are they out oftheir minds? It's the most patriotic, heart-tugging OBVIOUS song choice in the world for a countryoriented singer who needs to tap into Middle America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You want the audience to stand up? Yousing "God Bless The USA." David Cook -- Born in 1982, Cook tackles the Michael Jackson career-defining classic "Billie Jean" via the cover by Chris Cornell of Soundgarden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's really a triumph, with Cook delivering the goods especially during a tricky vocal passage towards the end when his voice goes up into a higherregister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This slow-burning rocker is exactly what he does and I fear his album might be atiresomely moody, mid-tempo affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But contrasted with the pop and soul offerings of the othersingers, his emo sensibility is always welcome relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was rough on the last note, but who cares?The judges rave and rightly so, though Cook needs to stop the hokey bowing with the "handsclasped in humble thanks" gesture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's been very, very consistent the last few weeks and noticethe judges don't complain a bit about him doing the same thing again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not when it worksthis well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Daughtry might have been jealous if his solo career hadn't been so explosivelysuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the judges thought Syesha, Michael Johns, Kristy Lee Cook and David Cook were all terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd agree about Syesha and David Cook (the two stand-outs to me) and certainly Johns and Kristy are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think David Archuleta is safe as well and given that he sang an utterly obscure song and not that well, that tells you how strong his fanbase really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Computers India Barack Obama Michelle Obama Sports Olympics Housing Crisis Fox News Cars MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

Shame on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're right about the eliminationsbeing unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just I've done a much better job of guessing right in seasons past.What should be more predictable is the people that are safe: David Cook and DavidArchuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whoever else falls by the wayside, those two should at least make the final three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink Yet ANOTHER twist on the Double-A-side thing! The two Queen songs were conventionally releasedon 45 as A side (We Are The Champions) and B side (We Will Rock You).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the conventional wisdomnow that they were released as a double-A side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, they are generally played together (much tomy chagrin, personally, cause I hate both songs) on the radio as a medley because that is how thesongs appear on the LP News of the World, Tracks 1 and 2 of Side 1, back to back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Beatles case (to follow up on your previous request from clarification), the double A's were as follows: Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out, Yellow Submarine/Eleanor Rigby, Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields, Come Together/Something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rationale for doing it this way is, with two strong songs, basically, let the public sort it out, let demand dictate via radio which is more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not to mention, radioprogrammers and DJs had much more sway in those days long before a few corporations controlledmost nationwide playlists in affecting rotation of singles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hard to explain so conciselyin this format.

Is it just labeled that way? Is there some pricing distinction? Is it when both songsappear on the album? Not sure how we can know it when we see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here I thought I wasbeing so clever and learning my lesson when it came to Queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't hate those two songs -- amazingly -- despite hearing them eight zillion times at sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe I associatethem now with the Yankees staging a rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for the clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only "Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane" (often dubbed the greatest single of all time thanks to two such classic and diverse tracks) had appeared on Sgt Pepper where they belonged that landmark album would have been even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeoMarvin See Profile I'm a Fan of LeoMarvin permalink I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe I'm getting old and cranky, but I think this year's crop looks better and sings worse than last year's (with some notable exceptions -- hello, Sanjaya).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have to keep reminding myself thatthis is a country that chose Taylor Hicks and George W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink You're not cranky -- just discriminating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't pull for Taylor Hicks but I wouldn't write him offyet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe his second album (the ones where the artists actually have a little control over thecontent) will let him show his inner Michael McDonald a little better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never write any of themoff till the second CD is out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the one that indicates their potential a lot better than thefirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hey, the popular vote was for Gore, not Bush -- and even the electoral college isdebatable, so don'y hold Bush's first term against the voters too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, the second term, that's another story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:30 AM on 03/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:36 PM on 03/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:10 PM on 03/27/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:41 PM on 03/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:00 PM on 03/26/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 10: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_93433.html [4/5/2009 7:19:31 PM] mch755 See Profile I'm a Fan of mch755 permalink Here's my take: Favorites: 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook- say what you will about the same ole thing each week, he nailed "Billie Jean".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is really being steady every week offering what he does best, rock vibes to very familier songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I say keepdoing what your doing since the judges love it.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha- I wasn't real familier with the song but she sang it well, I wish she had kept the straight hair since she looked so nice last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's building on last week and thats a good thing. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael- Finally a good performance from the Aussie! Though the stadium like lights in the background kept blinding me! He sang pretty confidently so kudos for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Semi favorite:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David A- I had no idea what the song was that he was singing when I heard it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not sure whysomeone on AI would pick a song no one knows, but he sang it ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that great but the tweens will keep him on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guy needs to do more uptempo stuff, tired of the FM Lite songbook! Non favorites: 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramiele- Poor little Ramiele, up first and just didn't sound that great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her voice seemed to go in andout for me, sometimes it sounded fine and next it sounded terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was cringing in my sofa thinkingthis is it for her, I hope not, so I voted extra for her. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee- ugh...total pandering, enough said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink So YOU"RE the reason Ramiele stayed in this week! You're def right about the blinding "rock star" lights during Michael Johns' performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm always looking to see who gets the mostlavish, favorable production each week from the producers (hey, they've got their favoritesjust like everyone else) and Michael Johns and Kristy Lee Cook were def the ones to get thefull court press this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please let Ramiele go home next week (assuming her performanceis just as weak ) -- she's gone far enough. mch755 See Profile I'm a Fan of mch755 permalink Ha..ha.. yeah, me and quite a number of people are voting for the little one,Ramiele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really feel she's due for great performance, my feeling is she's learning, Ihope, what works for her and what she needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She doesn't have theexperience of old hands like Carly, David A or Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I really think she'll bring itthis coming week, and if she doesn't I promise I won't vote extra for her! I am gettingtired of being disappointed week after week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GO RAMIELE!!! observing See Profile I'm a Fan of observing permalink Forgive my ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What does emo mean?

Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink The only sign of ignorance is NOT asking what a word of idea means that you haven't heardof before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asking is a sign of intelligence. "Emo" is a very loosely defined genre of music thattoday sort of/kind of refers to rock bands with passionate soaring, anthemic chorusesbordering on hard rock, which is the makeover David Cook has given to a number of tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itsprang out of the hardcore punk scene via bands like Fugazi and Sunny Day Real Estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itevolved into something more melodic via Dashboard Confessional and Jimmy Eat World.Today it's thrown around by fools like me to describe any sort of moody rocker that explodesor even gets a little grungey and hardcore on their choruses (my favorite emo band is the indie group Signal The Escape which has sort of gone through the entire evolution of emo in their brief career and is now more melodic than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The early acts sound NOTHING likeCook and would have nothing to do with him and most of the people tagged as "emo" hatethe term as much as minimalists like Philip Glass and Steve Reich hate that label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musicated See Profile I'm a Fan of Musicated permalink Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:45 PM on 03/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:55 PM on 03/26/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:48 PM on 03/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:36 AM on 03/29/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:15 PM on 03/26/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:55 PM on 03/28/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 10: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_93433.html [4/5/2009 7:19:31 PM] One thing is for sure...David Cook is a very smart contestant and his calculations and performances have pretty much been on point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Say what you will about that particular version of "Billie Jean", henailed it within an inch of its life and right now he's wearing the 'Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consistency' label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conventional wisdom in our living room was that Carly Smithson's version of Bonnie Tyler's hit was superior to Tyler's...that is until the dreaded 'reach' at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was like a hockey game and there's amad rush with some great passes and then, ohhhhh, the shot's high and sails over the crossbar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shewas oh so close but, alas, murdered the ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're right Michael, Kristy Lee Cook played the "Amazing Grace" card once again with that Lee Greenwood flag-waver that is very low on my list of songs because it's so transparent in its design andthat makes it a compositional weakling in my estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Translation: I love my country and hate that song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What fascinates me about Chikezie is that he actually has a good set of pipes but the confusion that he exhibits in terms of measuring criticism is now officially wreaking havoc with his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lookedcrushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do what the other musical greats do: pop a Xanax and blow the whole thing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Castrohas made this pleasant indifference into an art form right before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Good analysis -- especially of Jason's mellow appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I can't support believing any singerhas one-upped the drama queen Bonnie Tyler; until Carly gets that rasp in her voice, she'llalways be in Bonnie's shadow on that song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charity See Profile I'm a Fan of Charity permalink what is up with simon and his infatuation with brooke? he continues to praise her for what is ostensiblya weak voice with absolutely no range whatsoever. the one time she sang something upbeat, she blewit. simon, even when damning her with faint praise this week, managed to work in the word 'fantastic' in relation to her. as in 'could have been fantastic....' hence, leaving impressionable viewers with the words "fantastic and brooke" in their minds even though she was neither and he meant neither. contrast this to other singers this week who did far better than ms. brooke; simon took great pains to damn them all, pretty much, with nary a mention of the word 'fantastic' in any sense of the word (reverse negative or whatever). while he liked syesha this week, he has been consistent in damningnearly all of her performances, which primarily have been far and above anything brooke OR davidcook has done. this is the first season in all the seasons of idol that i have detected something odd about the judges comments in that their comments don't seem to match the reality of the performances unless it isunquestionably, by anyone standards, good. if simon were to consistently spread his infatuation around other contestants such as two strong singers such as syesha and carly, one would not see those two end up in the bottom three as they havepreviously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink Charity, Couldn't agree more that the judges are wildly inconsistent in their praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They constantly parrot the notion that it's "A Singing Competition" then they cream all over themselves whenmediocre singers like Kristy, by far the worst singer left, and Michael, the least technicallyproficient male singer, do their big production numbers, the treacly "God Bless the USA" and overblown Queen medley, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They need be honest with themselves and the contestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't so much a singing or talent competition as a PAGEANT, plain andsimple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it were truly just a singing competition, the best performances last night were fromSyeesha, Chakizie, and Carly (save for the dreadful bum note at the very end).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On another subject, Charity, still not "over" my hatred for Yoko Ono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is richly deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for the sermon though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glad you've made your peace with the beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:41 PM on 03/26/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:07 AM on 03/27/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:15 PM on 03/26/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:39 PM on 03/26/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 10: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_93433.html [4/5/2009 7:19:31 PM] Charity, the judges have seemed more self-involved than usual this season, always a danger as they get so much attention themselves and their interplay is one of the few consistent elements of the show and thus overdone at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like everyoneelse, the judges have their favorites and aren't shy about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon announced Carrie Underwood would win it all even before Hollywood Week, which should have taken the excitement out of everything especially since she was so dominant and apparently won the voting every week by a mile, the way I suspect Archuleta is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when you have favorites (we all do), ti colors your review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don'tthink it's anything more nefarious than putting the kids you think are the mosttalented in the best light .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DC Dan, it is indeed more than just a singing competition - people who are likable, do well on camera, have good interplay w Ryan and the judges will do better than asinger who doesn't do well on those extra-curricular activities, just like a real popsinger who gives good press and charms radio does better than one who givesboring or obnoxious interviews and ticks off deejays and programmers with theirattitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Yoko, she's done a very good job managing John's legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's faced enough vitriol and the Beatles would have broken up anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All luziannagirl See Profile I'm a Fan of luziannagirl permalink Who's my favorite, and who do I think will get sent home? Well, since two of my three favorites have been inexplicably voted off and sent home even before reaching the final 10 , I am not very motivated to watch the show any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a guilty pleasureanyhow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And btw, y'all, wonder what's with America for voting off the supremely talented and beautiful Asiah, and the always entertaining Rockin' Biker Nurse, anyway? Before the final 10, no less! What, was there confusion over similar unusual names? Some unconscious, self-flagellatory voter preference for the foreign-born over native Americans? (I mean, after all, this is AMERICAN Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't both Britain andAustralia have their own contests????) Maybe the producers uncovered some unsavory personal detail&amp; disguised it as getting voted off? Or, maybe like game shows of yesteryear, the contest is simplyrigged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regarding why certain folk get votes &amp; others don't, ultimately, I wonder if it wasn't nicely summed up a few yrs ago by comedian/talent show host Arsenio Hall: "America, you crazy." blueraven See Profile I'm a Fan of blueraven permalink The people you're complaining about are either American citizens or have their green cards, so you're sounding just a tad provincial here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ireland does NOT participate in Pop Idol.Wrong country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Many countries have their own Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure what the Idol rules are about flyingin from other countries (I ASSUME you have to at least reside in the US) but don'tknow actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for teh show being rigged: absolutely not, for the simple reasonthat the producers have no reason to rig it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't really care because thedrama of people staying in and being voted off is unpredictable and that's part ofthe show's appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just don't care who wins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all makes good TV drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DemandTruth See Profile I'm a Fan of DemandTruth permalink David Cook is my favorite by far! He's the only one who is consistent with his pitch too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe one ortwo off notes, where others sing whole songs out of key (Brooke - yes Brooke!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a pet peeve ofmine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't consider anyone a decent singer who can't sing on pitch!

Thisweek was kind of boring for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I ended up fast forwarding through Chikeze, Kristy &amp; Archuleta'ssongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time I did not dislike Carly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never heard Bonnie Tyler sing that song live but tome Carly sang it the way I would imagine Tyler would sing it, except for that run in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wasdisappointed with Brooke's performance, I like her and I love Every Breath You Take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was hoping shewould nail it but she just didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree with the judges, the begining was great, then it got, not great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason was ok but it would have been better if the band had a bigger part in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Notice how in the recaps at the end of the show, the band was more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think since those highlight pieces are of rehearsals and not of what actually aired, Jason made changes to make it more acoustic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall my favorite was David C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just think he's more entertaining and I like the versions of the songs he does,even if they're someone else's versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a nice change for American Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PBKman See Profile I'm a Fan of PBKman permalink I think you are mistaken about the recaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are indeed from tonight's show, just like anInstant Replay in a football game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go Missouri!!!!
