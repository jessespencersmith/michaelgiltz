                <p>=oz oz=0 learned to hold a crowd's attention the har.d way: by working as street performers in Europe so they could afford to eat and rent a hotel room. "I remember the first show we did in London," says Francisco Cruz, 24, who, with younger brother Raphael and three of their best friends, went on an unofficial "tour" of Europe during a summer break from clown school in Montreal to work thecrowds for pocket change. "\Me made this whole show written all down on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't think we picked the best spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our show was 25 minutes long and we made, Ithink, three pounds," Cruz laughs. "That's about $6! It was ridiculous."But they'd been perfoming and re- hearsing together for years Francisco and Raphael gtew upjust outside San Francisco and met their friends Brad Henderson and William Underwood while studying circus moves, like Chinese hoop-diving, hand-to-hand (which in- volves glmnastics-like moves with a part- ner) and Chinese-pole mmeuvers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They aII wenl to Montreal for cirrus college. and there mel Hâ‚¬loise Bourgeois The five became inseparable, constantly working together on tricks and routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So they knew how to adapt "For the rest of our time in hndon, in- stead of doing sheet shows, we'd actually work a street light," explaitr Cro. "V/e'd find a busy intersection, md when there i was a red light, we'd run out, do a trick then M to each car and try to get money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they'd be throwing money at u! In an hou4 we'd make about 80 pounds ln two hours, we'd make 200 pomds " If it wasn't already cleil, they were , meant to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, as they neared graduation in 2001, a Montreal-based circus company caLled the 7 Fingers was lpoking to create a show Veterans of the nouveau perfor- l mmce phenomenon Cirque du Soleil, the 7 Fingers had casually forrned out of a desire to create their oM show. 'lve reallywmted to create something , we called 'circus with a humal scale,"' i says Shana Canoll, one of the artistic d! r rectors of the company md, along with .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gypsy Snider, a director of "Traces." "We'dbeen doingthese huge produc- : tions, and our instinct was to go intimate : and demystify circus " Their f,rst production - "Lofts," in 2002 - was an inmediate hit and is still perfomed all over the world- They wanted to build on that success without /'. duplicating it, and here was a group of kids Camoll had known since most of them were little (She and Snider uged them to further their leming in Montreal.) "After their three years of circus school, we thought, hey, we should hire them!" says Cmoll "If anyone is going to do a show with them, it should be us." The result is "Traces," a 90-minute burst of energy and creativity that incor- porates eveq/thing from basketball and skateboarding and piano playing toIn classic 7 Fingers style, the five per- formers reveal details about thernFelves so the audience becomes invested in them as personalities md really cres about the dangerous, physically demmding work they do onstage lt's the sme lesson they lemed in London "It's not only about the trick," says Cruz of the show he has been working on and perforrning in for more than two years "People need to see personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They need to see we're having fun." Sometimes, almost too much fun, "They're young, and there are attention-span problems compared to other people we're used to working with," laughs Canoll, who hopes another 7 Fingers show - "La Vie," a dark caba- r et act - can refum to New York for an extended run after playing in the Spie- geltent at South Street Seaport last yetr "Putting skateboards and basket- balls in the shows. sometimes we think it wasn't such a good idea because every time there's a five-second break. thev're jumping around!" a d2 cl4qsic stunts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has played onfe cotftftbntsbofai'.
