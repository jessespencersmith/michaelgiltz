Wryly amusingbut serious, personable but penetrating, simply delivering Woolf's voice can provide an exceptional evening of theater (as evidenced by Eileen Atkins' A Room Of One's Own and Vita and Virginia .) But the pleasures of this Room are more intellectual than emotional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At first, Lauren seems a bit mannered as she crosses the stage, but naturalistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slowly, certain tics appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When she discusses writing, one hand flies up and points a finger down and then slowly descendsuntil it rests on an open palm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another arm gets a bit restless and has to be pushed back into place or itflies off on its own, reaching for the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the show progresses, the stylized movements become moreand more predominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slowly, you realize that at times Woolf is lowering gently to the ground at unexpected moments or is pinned against the back wall during an especially revealing discourse and yet it all proceeds so smoothly you don't question it in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lauren handles the transitions between conversation/lecture and the choreographed movement, from public lecture to private memory with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It climaxes in a wonderful moment where Woolf's insight intowhat has made her an artist is captured in all its exhilarating thrill by a frenzied explosion into puredance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tech elements are handled superbly, especially the movement by Barney O'Hanlon and thesoundscape by Darron L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West, all brought together by Bogart and Lauren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of Woolf andadventurous dance/theater shouldn't hesitate to head to this production by Women's Project and SITI Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 2010-2011 THEATER SEASON (ratings on a four star system) Angels in America revival at Signature *** out of **** Beautiful Burnout at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse ** Blood From A Stone ** 1/2 The Broadway Musicals Of 1921 at Town Hall ***Devil Boys From Beyond ** The Diary Of A Madman with Geoffrey Rush at BAM ***Driving Miss Daisy ** Elf * Elling ** A Free Man Of Color ** 1/2 Gatz *** Good People with Frances McDormand ** The Grand Manner ** The Great Game *** Gruesome Playground Injuries *** The Hallway Trilogy: Nursing **The Hallway Trilogy: Paraffin *** Striking Distance Of Obama Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
