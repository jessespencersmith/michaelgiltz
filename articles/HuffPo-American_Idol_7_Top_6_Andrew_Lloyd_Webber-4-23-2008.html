Uh, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butheck, you could say "he's composed some of themost successful musicals of all time," with Catsbeing surpassed on Broadway only by his ownPhantom of the Opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could say he's composed "some of the most successful andacclaimed and influential musicals of all time" and I wouldn't argue with you there, since both those two and others like Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar have gobbled up Tonys and huge box office returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really, with all the accolades one could shower on Lloyd Webber, why say something that in fact is quite debatable? It cheapenswhat he has accomplished by trying to insist on some grand statement that immediately makes youthink, "What about Sondheim?" That's no way to celebrate someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SYESHA MERCADO -- Sang "One Rock N Roll Too Many," a song from Starlight Express of all things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely one of ALW's most derided shows, it's also been remarkably resilient, especially in the UK and on the road. (It's a bit of silliness about people on skates pretending to be trains.) Herightly said it was an "interesting choice." Then Syesha belted it out with gusto, looking very sexy ina red dress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was so relaxed and confident, it was no surprise to find out she's a theater baby.She had a little rough moment on a high note right near the end but finished well and was veryconfident throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To my delight, the judges didn't seem to be watching a differentperformance this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy raved and said she could be a huge Broadway star, Paula said "this isyour happy place" and Simon said she was very sexy, spoiling it a little by saying this was one ofher best performances so far. (Syesha looked a little mock peeved when he didn't say it was herbest performance so far, bar none, but to me it looked cute not annoying, though I've been a fan ofhers for a while.)

ALW proved a useful coach throughout, convincingly saying he was there to serve them, providing good tips and subtly letting us into his opinion, in this case by saying about Jason's pick: "not sure I would have done it." Translation: don't think he can pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He does, sort of, crooning the tune in the expected lightweight manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very rough on the low notes in the transition ("burnt out ends of smoky days") and basically getting through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not quite a disaster but not memorable either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy plays it off as being a genre unsuited to Jason, Paula says something nice and Simon nails it by saying Jason looked like someone being forced to sing a song they didn't want to sing at the family wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BROOKE WHITE -- Sang "You Must Love Me" from the film version of Evita .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALW zeroed in on my biggest complaint about Brooke: she doesn't pay attention to the words (singing "Every Breath You Take" like a standard love song instead of the stalker anthem it is, etc.) He said bluntly thatshe didn't have a clue as to what she's singing and then related the story and context of the tune toher, with Brooke looking very weepy as he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She begins the tune and then stops after aboutfour or five words to begin again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of the tune sounds wildly over-deliberate, with Brookeoddly enunciating certain words, getting out of breath, pausing dramatically ("You must...love me!You must love...me!") Nervous and weird, it seems to take twice as long as all the otherperformances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Train wreck, really, and it ends with very tentative, uncertain applause from theusually robotically enthusiastic audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy is very negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula pauses a long time beforespeaking (never a good sign) and then says simply, "You must never start and stop." before giving amixed critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon is very negative and describes her as "tense." To her credit, Brooke didn'tcomment or talk back this time, maybe because it went so poorly her confidence was shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryanasked her what happened and she answered simply that she'd forgotten the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan askedSimon what he would have done in that situation and Simon said, "I would have done exactly whatshe did," the only positive moment of the entire night for Brooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula said again that you shouldnever stop -- just fake the lyrics and sing whatever comes into your heart -- and Simon said youcan't do that and Randy chimed in that Simon was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guess what? They're all correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon isright that to deal with a crisis, stopping and starting over can be the wisest option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Paula isright that you should never put yourself in that position in the first place and that it would bebetter to fake it for a line and keep on going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula is also talking from the point of view of anelaborate live show where everything is choreographed down to lights and fireworks and major setand costume changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once that baby gets rolling, you can't just stop and start over (especially ifyou're lip-syncing and doing major dance moves); you've got to keep moving whether it's an arenashow or a Broadway musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID ARCHULETA -- Sang "Think Of Me" from The Phantom of the Opera, the longest running show in Broadway history and one of the biggest (if not the biggest) hit musicals of all time (though The Lion King and that darn Mamma Mia are looking awfully scrappy, they have a LONG way to go to catch up with Phantom , which is still going strong 20 years after it opened).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALW said it was "written for a diva" and enjoyed David's take on the tune but had one salient bit of advice: open your eyes! I hadn't realized how often Archuleta does that, but he admitted it was a tendency he was trying to work on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, along with his lip-licking and breathing, we can watch outfor David and his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The whole segment began very annoyingly with Ryan Seacrest inviting girlsup to hug him which was tacky, rude to the other contestants (stop treating him like he's alreadywon) and unfair to David who quite rightly had no idea how to react -- he's not a plush doll, he's asinger getting ready to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, when he did perform, I spent the entire song laughingabout David's constant struggle not to close his eyes, a tic he clearly fought again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was watching via Slingbox, which doesn't handle rewinding very well, so I saw the entire show in order without any repeating of musical numbers like I usually do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, he was solid and had a very strong ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy raved, Paula raved and Simon said it was pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's about right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not one of his best but far from weak. (By the way, I lose a bet with myself since I was CERTAIN David would sing "No Matter What" from Whistle Down The Wind .) CARLY SMITHSON -- Sang "Jesus Christ Superstar" from the show of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've often thought it was interesting that ALW and Tim Rice did this show after having done Joseph and theAmazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You think they might have been worried over being pigeonholedas people who write religious musicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they ended that talk with Evita , which is ALW's strongest musical as a whole, with the best book combining with some of his best music and lyrics(by Rice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALW also earned his money by quickly rejecting Carly's first pick of "All I Ask Of You" "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on Panel of ABC's "This Week" With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a panelistthis morning on...

He hit that big note in the middle tremendously well and did a slightly rockish andeffective key change at the end that let him wail away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a huge recovery from being so-so lastweek and a train wreck when he tackled Our Lady Peace's "Innocent" the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I was athome and had this on my DVR, I would save the performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BOTTOM THREE -- So who is it going to be this week? Well, Syesha went first but I think she's going to squeak into the top three past Carly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I predict the bottom three will be Carly and Jason and Brooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason and Brooke are clearly the bottom two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was bland but she was an awkward disaster, so Brooke will be saying goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jesus was back on Idol but since no one substituted "Shepherd" for "Jesus" in "Jesus Christ Superstar," I think the non- Idol fans will remain away this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!

You look like you belong on Rykers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TurgidCaterwauling See Profile I'm a Fan of TurgidCaterwauling permalink Artichoke hugely overrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comes across as the high school choir boy he obviously is .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnest, to besure, but not enjoyable to watch. mch755 See Profile I'm a Fan of mch755 permalink cont'5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly- she looked very nice tonight, covered the tats and sang pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shouty at times but atleast she looked like she was having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe she realizes she won't win and so she's letting herhair down so to speak. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David C- for me the best of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sang the song in a very straighforward manner, no shadings ofemo lite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought it was a great changeup and now he can go back to what he does best next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I disagreed with Simon, I liked this side of David, it was different and showed his versatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking more and more like a very serious challenger to the other David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottom three will be Jason/Brooke and Syesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though Syesha was very good, she just doesn't seem to have a big enough fan base at this point of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which is unfortunate since she could be hitting her stride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I do think Brooke is gone tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink ALW even looked uncomfortable sitting in the audience, frankly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then he can go homeand sink into a pile of hundred pound notes, so what does he care? mch755 See Profile I'm a Fan of mch755 permalink Another spot on assesment of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALW was a good mentor, he gave good pointers and was toothe point, not too much chit chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did look dreadfully unconfortable at the end of the show on stagewith Ryan and folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess being the man behind the scenes will do that, I had no idea what the guylooked like till this week.As for the singers:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha- I think she did a terrific job with her song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was sexy and confortable on stage and itshowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do agree that going first at this point of the game won't really matter since there are so few Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:44 PM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:01 AM on 04/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:12 PM on 04/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:57 PM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:35 PM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:03 AM on 04/24/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 6: Andrew Lloyd Webber http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-6-a_b_98129.html[4/5/2009 7:05:22 PM] singers left but it can't help either. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason- total trainwreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That pretty much sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This song was way beyond his range and scope of emotion it wasn't even funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would be worst of the night if not for ....... 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke- 2nd trainwreck of the night and an even worst wreck than Jason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She lost total confidence in herself after that false start and it was painful too watch, but also fascinating at the same time I have too say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not sure if her psyche will recover if she manages to get past this week.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David A- I know you feel he's the inevitable winner of this, but I have to agree with Simon it was bland and forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also think he messed up some lyrics though I'm not totally sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink Syesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ridiculous how sexy she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And not at all a bad singer either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three words: Put-the-bong-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Owh, dude, like, I meant, FOUR words . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dreadful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be very okay if he went away right about now (make that next week, please, after Brooke).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guess what? I Don't Must Love You.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get out of here with your simpering earnestness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for once Paula was constructive and pithy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In live performance, you never, ever, stop.(Unless you're Elvis Costello on SNL in 1978 doing Radio Radio.) Brooke had her mulligan with thePolice tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No more free passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really enjoyed his performance of a song I had never heard before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To me, it seems that's what it's all about: an entertainer being entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon, on the other hand, gave his usualdismissive "didn't particularly like it," parenthetically, "cause I don't know the song." Carly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was greatly assisted by razzle-dazzle lights and quick camera shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She seems like a genuinely likeable person though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First time I recall liking him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He finally went an entire song without oversinging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All good until that very last big "rawk" note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A good singer knows he doesn't need to show off his range every timeout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for the comments. "I Don't Must Love You" def the comment of the week. :) Andnamecheckng Elvis Costello in an SNL performance -- bonus points for that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JuanRamirez See Profile I'm a Fan of JuanRamirez permalink Bottom three? Jason, Brooke and David A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is getting more forgettable every week.Either Jason or Brooke gets the boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other gets one more week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kashathree See Profile I'm a Fan of Kashathree permalink With all of the amazing songs attributed to Andrew Lloyd Webber, the contestants made a lot of bad choices, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Actually, that was an issue I didn't tackle but I think you're right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archuleta's choice a bit oddand now in retrospect Jesus Christ Superstar -- which is a good song in the context of a bigrousing production number -- isn't so good as a solo tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has anyone covered this songoutside a huge concert staging of the musical? I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And "Memory" is one of thefew bombastic ALW numbers so it was maybe the easiest choice for Castro, but clearly didn'tdo him any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink "Superstar" did pretty well for Murray Head in the context of a 45 rpm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The single,released from the original soundtrack, went Top 20 in U.S. 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:30 PM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:55 PM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:04 AM on 04/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:54 PM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:55 AM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:07 AM on 04/24/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 6: Andrew Lloyd Webber http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-6-a_b_98129.html[4/5/2009 7:05:22 PM] Comments are closed for this entryHowever, I agree with you, it didn't work well for Carly in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having said that, it certainly wasn't the worst performance of the night and she didn't deserve to getbooted for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For once, Randy came up with something salient: it's coming down topopularity and fan-base size (if it wasn't already all along).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that Syeeshawas second from the bottom -- after giving almost inarguably the best performanceof the night, especially within the framework of a true Broadway production number -- certainly substantiates Randy's assertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't matter what Syeesha does, howgreat she looks, or how well she performs; she won't win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly would have been better served covering "I Don't Know How to Love Him" (ditto Brooke) rathering than channeling Amanda Overmeyer in a lame attempt toearn her Rocker Chick bona fides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The whole thing was shrill and redundant. badjuggler See Profile I'm a Fan of badjuggler permalink Syesha ruled the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sucked they put her on first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Castro was painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See ya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ihope I never hear the phrase "G-rated nanny" again for the rest of my life. gavintiegirl See Profile I'm a Fan of gavintiegirl permalink I disagree with your bottom three pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Carly's performance was much more exciting and memorable than Syesha's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha has bored me to tears this entire season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the bottom three "should be" and "will be" as follows:Brooke, Syesha, and JasonWith Brooke going on home.Carly, David A., and David C. will be safe and rightfully so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contestants from American Idol 7 are by far the most void of personality than any other season so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope next season they look for singers that also have some personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny Noriega had themost personality of all the Idol 7 contestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink You're certainly not alone in being bored by Syesha since the judges and the voters seem toagree with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This group doesn't seem to have any sharp edges personality-wise, which isironic since this season the producers devoted themselves to....staying more focused on thecontestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny Noriega had oodles of personality, but for me David Hernandez had abetter voice than half the people in the final six. kls9331 See Profile I'm a Fan of kls9331 permalink Winner of the night: David Cook!!! Who knew he could sing a showtune???Loser: Definitely Brooke White who seems to be getting worse each week rather than improving!Most honest mentor critiques: ALW! Kashathree See Profile I'm a Fan of Kashathree permalink Thanks, kls9331.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought I was the only one whot hought Brooke was a loser from thebeginning. such a phony! No voice, no stage presence, no understanding of the lyrics.Please--let her go tonight and let the audience out of its misery.Carly was fantastic and so was Sayesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook is really doing an amazing job amongthe male contestants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glad he got his mouth under control and got the purple out of his hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:36 PM on 04/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:12 AM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:57 AM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:10 AM on 04/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:18 AM on 04/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:53 AM on 04/23/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 6: Andrew Lloyd Webber http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-6-a_b_98129.html[4/5/2009 7:05:22 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!
