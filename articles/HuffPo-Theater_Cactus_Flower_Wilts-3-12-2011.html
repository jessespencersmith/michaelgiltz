Except for one notable exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd heard of the show but never saw it or the film adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It certainly has a terrific pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cactus Flower was adapted from a French play by Abe Burrows (who should get a much happier revival with How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, a dentist tells his ditsy but sweet girlfriend that he's married so she won't get serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he gets serious, his nurse has to pretend to be his wife to reassure the girl she's no home-wrecker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no surprise that the nurse loves her dentist and the nebbishywriter next door (Jeremy Bobb) loves the kooky girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Complications ensue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somehow, it was a smash hitand ran for more than 1200 performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lauren Bacall and Brenda Vaccaro starred, but they were bothshafted when it became a film and their roles were played by Ingrid Bergman (such a great comedianne!)

Because in the midst of this mess, Lois Robbins (a mainstay with roles on four different soaps) somehow manages to deliver a solid, funny performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While everyone else is playingfor laughs and delivering punch lines, Robbins is playing a character and delivering dialogue -- andnaturally, that means she garners most of the laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't mean to oversell her work here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justmaintaining your dignity would be accomplishment enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Robbins is good enough to make me think that -- who knows? -- maybe Cactus Flower could be revived with the right attitude and cast, a la Boeing Boeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that I'm eager to see it brought back anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I am eager to see Robbins again in a show that let's her show her real talent at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 2010-2011 THEATER SEASON (ratings on a four star system) Angels in America revival at Signature *** out of **** Beautiful Burnout at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse ** Blood From A Stone ** 1/2 The Broadway Musicals Of 1921 at Town Hall *** Devil Boys From Beyond ** The Diary Of A Madman with Geoffrey Rush at BAM *** Driving Miss Daisy ** Elf * Elling ** A Free Man Of Color ** 1/2 Gatz *** Good People with Frances McDormand ** The Grand Manner ** The Great Game *** Gruesome Playground Injuries *** The Hallway Trilogy: Nursing ** The Hallway Trilogy: Paraffin *** Striking Distance Of Obama Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
