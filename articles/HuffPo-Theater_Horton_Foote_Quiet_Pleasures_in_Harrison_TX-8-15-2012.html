Anavenging angel? The guilty conscience of the owner that simply won't go away? Cendese didn't seem toknow, so we didn't either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if a different production of this would be thoroughly gripping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Chekhov, Foote is seemingly easy to do but without hitting exactly the right note, the essence of the work is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last play also has its faults, but the large cast and the general strength of the story keep it afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Midnight Caller is about the residents of a boarding house in 1952, all women until a businessman moves in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's upsetting to the fussbudget Alma Jean Jordan (a very funny Mary Bacon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the realproblems begin when Helen Crews is kicked out of her home and moves in as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helen is a scandal tosome in town because the handsomest, wealthiest man in Harrison fell for her and she would go off with him on car rides and other jaunts at any hour of the day or night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were desperately in love, but their mothers kept them apart and she finally gave up while he sank into alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now wherever she lives,he comes over three sheets to the wind and bellows out her name until he tires of it and stumbles home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bobb is quite good as the businessman who takes a shine to Helen (much to the unspoken frustration of Alma Jean).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's the women of the boarding house who make this a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bacon is marvelous,matched by Green as "Cutie" Spencer, the superior Jayne Houdyshell as a schoolteacher who realizes shehas spent her life on the porch watching other people's lives take shape and, of course, Hallie Foote as the proprietor, again so good you can't get enough of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, Helen and the drunken gentleman caller are played by Jenny Dare Paulin and Cendesne, both of whom are by far the weakest of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may simply be a lack of experience with Foote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His lines are simple to memorize but getting them right is an entirely different matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, taken as a whole this is a solid entertainment showing the durability and strength of Foote's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pam MacKinnon directs with subtlety, the costumes by Kaye Voyce are spot on and the lighting by Tyler Micoleau sensitive to the moment at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set by Marion Williams is functional, though they might have found a more elegant solution to where to place Helen's room in the third play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, with limited means and a small stage, it is quickly peopled by the world Foote created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping hisworks keep coming back to New York again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
