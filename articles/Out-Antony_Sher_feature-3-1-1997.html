                <p>coming Indian Summer, a film written by playwright Martin Sherman (Bent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sher's role in Stanley is at the opposite end of the sexual spectrum: Stanley Spencer was a painter who scandalized Britain because he set his religious works in local settings (the Resurrection in Cookham, for exam­ ple) and couldn't see why an artist should be limited to just one woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps Sher's Broadway experi­ ence will one day turn up in print: His just-published Woza Shakespear e! (pub­ lished in the u.K. by Methuen) is the actor's diary about mounting Titus Andronicus in his homeland, South Mrica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It serves as a sequel of sorts to Year of the King, an acclaimed 1985 work recounting a production of Richard III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In King, Sher makes only passing ref­ erence to his "roommate," Jim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Woza-co-written with his partner of 10 years, Gregory Doran-finds Sher getting irked when Doran isn't allowed to accompany him to an audience with Prince Edward, joining in a Gay Pride march with Ian McKellen, and gener­ ally acting like a model citizen of the queer nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renaissance actor Antony Sher crosses the Atlantic. "Growing up in Cape Town [South Mrica] when I did, I was the only gay person in the world," Sher says of his gradual coming out. "My partner Greg, growing up here in the u.K., had exactly the same feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So whenever we do publicity and mention it casually, it is simply to make it there: ONDON-BASED actor Antony Sher enters Marsden's, a French restaurant in a sleepy suburb of the city, with a mildly distracted air, as if he interrupted some project to keep this ren­ dezvous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It could be any number of things: more research on Disraeli, the character he portrays in Her Majesty, Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brown, which Sher is currently filming; working on a novel, since he's already published three accomplished books, most recently Cheap Lives, about a gay man haunted by the fact he was spared by a notorious serial killer; or perhaps he was just working on a charcoal sketch or writing in his well-known diary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever it was, the trip home to 50 MARCH I997 OUT his work will be a short one, since Sher lives just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 47- year-old actor will make a much longer journey when he brings Stanlera play written expressly for him by Pam Gems-to Broadway in February, These people are doing these jobs and making his belated New York theatrical debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sher has been a major force in British the­ ater for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There, he they're not making a big issue of it." "Growing up in Cape Town when I did, I was the only gay person in the world." Also not making a big issue of the time, Sher looks discreetly at his watch. "The oils are calling," he says, revealing that it was a painting he was torn away from for this visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He says his goodbyes and heads home. says matter-of-factly, ''I'm usually offered the roles." Movies are another matter. "I hate auditioning," Sher con­ tinues. "It just seems to throw out the window everything I believe about act­ ing." Nevertheless, he gives a strong performance as an angry, somewhat dumpy therapist who falls in love with an HI V-positive dancer in the forth--MICHAEL GILTZ Michael Giltz has also written for Entertainment Weekly and for Blockbuster magazine. --</p>
