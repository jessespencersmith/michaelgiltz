                <p>MOVIES A young author strikes gold with fantasy tales BY MICHAEL GILTZ he new fantasy film "Eragon" _ the story of a young man who bonds with a dragon to fight evil -opened as the No.1 movie around the world, grossing Some $5:1 milLion. (That includes Ihe better-than-expected $23 million it grossed in the U,S" right behind Will Smith" "The Pun;ulr of Happynes s,") For Ihe book'. oung auU10r, ChristoÂ­ phel' Paolini, it's the latust jaw-droppong moment in hjs unlikely career, " Jy sister anil [ have been lravel- ing around I he country," says Paollni, who's now 23, "And everyWhere We go we're seeing 'Â£ragon' billboards and posters and previews on lelevision_ There's a fil'eÂ­ breathing dragon billÂ­ board in L.A.! We don't see this stuff in Montana because there aren't a lot of people in Montana .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There aren't a lot of billÂ­ boards because the bison don't go to the movies," Though he's young, Paolini is a fantasy veteran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Home-SChooled, he was ready for college at age 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his parents deÂ­ cided Paolini should wait until he was older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, with time on his hands, Paolini faÂ­ mOusly mnpped out a fantasy trilogy and began writing, When he was done wiU, the lirS! book, rile famUy decided 10 self-publish i1-and lOur Ihe country 10 promote the work, fj"sl-seliing aut ilor Carl Hiaascn ("Striptease," "Skinny Dip," "Natur" Girl") got wind of their success, read the book and pushed his publisher to snap up the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reÂ­ sult? Two best sellers: "Eragon" and its sequel, "Eldest," with more than I milÂ­ lion copies in print -and a third book on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Paolini always imagined hIS tale as a movie (he was going to write a script before it became a novel), seeÂ­ mg his story on the big screen with acÂ­ tors like Jeremy Irons and newcom- er Edward Speleers as Eragon seems amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What surprised him most about the movie? "Just the fact that it was a movie," he laughs. "There were times in the film when characters wouldÂ­ do a line of dialogue right out of the book and it was a deja YO, 'Twilight Zone'-sort of moment." College has been delayed for now, since Paolini has found his calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After he finishes the final book in the trilogy, he's bursting with ideas for novÂ­ els in all sorts of genres, including hisÂ­ torical fiction, romance, detective novÂ­ els, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since he started at 15, Paolini has devoted more than a third of his entire life (eight years and counting) to the trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But alreHtly, ev 'n :-,ollng r authors are nipping at his heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was d~lighlÂ­ cellO hear thai a girl in the U_IC is pubÂ­ li~l:ung her first fantasy. book at only 13 yem"S or age. tio as [he grand old mlln of youn.g fantasy aUlhors, when is he going to I1nish the fjn~ I book? "I do want to finish it as soon as posÂ­ sible," says Paolini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But apparently he's been struck by J.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rawling syndrome, because, he says, he's realized, "It just keeps getting bigger'" â€¢</p>
