"I llsed to speak in the church all the time," confesses Winfrey in interviews on the new six­ DVD box set" 'The Oprah WInfrey Show' -'nte 20th Anniversary Collection" (Paramount; $54.99). "The sisters in the frunt row fanning themselves would S&lt;ty to my gnUldmothe r, 'TIus child sure can talk!' " She's been talking ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new DVD box set - due out later th.i:; month and more than 17 hours long­ covers countless highlights, from weight· loss prograem; and makeovers to 1um emise's jmnp on the couch and that manic car giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also includes complete episodes -including her 50th birthday bash and a trip to Africa, Not just a clip jub, it features Winfrey talking about every aspect ufthe show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think she's too rich and powerful to get her feelings hurt? Think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winfrey decided to make dieting a show topic because "I wanted the people to know, 'I know that I'm rat It's a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know how many diets I've been un?' " Later, in talking about her single most-popular episode -the one where she wheeled out 67 pounJs of fat and shuwed off her slim, new jeans -Winfrey admits that two days after that show, she couldn't fit into those jeans anymore . "Every single tabloid story has hurt me as much as it would hurt anybody else who is reading that you're fat." Among the revelation s: Winfrey once dated film critic Roger Ebert; couldn't get a single celebrity to appear on her first nationally s-yndicated episode in 1986 (despite begging Don Johnsun of "Miami Vice," among others); admitted thilt during the '80s she looked like she was dressed by "a had drag queen ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, she was an immediate sensatiuIl - beating industry giant Phil Donahue in the Chicago ratings on the very first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the street, evervone recognized her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyonc 4 That didn't stop Winfrey from doing everything she could to bring in crowds. "I would stop at Dunkin Donuts in the morning­ myself -and pick up the donuts for the audience, " she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she can still hear the voice of her father who couldn't understand why Winfrey was unsatisfied working as a rv news reporter in Nashville, "Well, you're making $22,000 and you're 22," says Winfrey, imitating her father's gravelly voice. "I don't know what else you want in the wurld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You better save half your money because you're not going to make that kind of money forever:' Well, Oprah's father was half right.</p>
