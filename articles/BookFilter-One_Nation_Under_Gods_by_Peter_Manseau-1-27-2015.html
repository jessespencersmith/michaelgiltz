Money.) From the role of women in seeding new ideas to the role of Jews in theAmerican revolution to the role of Buddhists in WW II (their refusal to assimilate in terms of language and faith madethem hugely helpful to the Allied cause), Manseau's book repeatedly casts our common history into a new light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hissynthesis of well-established facts with original reporting make this Book One for any who want to be enlightened onthe true picture of religion in America. -- Michael Giltz LessWhat Others SayPraise for ONE NATION, UNDER GODS"Subversive and much-needed...[a] tour de force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A thorough reimagining of our nation's religions....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Engaginglywritten, with a historian's eye for detail and a novelist's sense of character and timing, this history from anotherperspective reexamines familiar tales and introduces fascinating counternarratives."âPublishers Weekly (starredreview) - "The United States is arguably the most religiously diverse nation in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Manseau shows how this hasalways been the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One Nation, Under Gods is a refreshing, compelling, and surprising reexamination of ournation's history that puts lie to the oft-quoted idea that America was founded as 'a Christian nation.'"âReza Aslan,author of No god but God and Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth - "Accessible and insightful prose...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A richer, more complex, and compelling viewpoint that is reminiscent of HowardZinn's People's History of the United States...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This significant and timely work is important for those who wish tounderstand the complete and…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
