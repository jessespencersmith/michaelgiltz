No, at the end of her speech she held up a sign with the nameof Iranian director Jafar Panahi in big bold letters and spoke out on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panahi is under arrest in Iran and in the midst of a hunger strike begun May 16 that might very well take his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To learn more about Panahi's plight and to take action, go to this Amnesty International site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Runner-Up prize went to Des Hommes Et Des Dieux/Of Gods And Men , a French film about the massacre of Cistercian monks in Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third prize went to the Chad film A Screaming Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Screenwriting went to the Korean film Poetry .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Camera d'Or went to Ano Bisiesto, a sexually provocative Mexican film that boasted what was easily the most explicit press kit of the fest, featuring as it did a naked woman pleasuring herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shut out completely was Mike Leigh's critically acclaimed Another Year, MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Celebrity Skin | Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

(He was the only director to have two films in the Top 10 of Film Comment's survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uncle Boonmee is positively accessible in comparison, even though it features monkey ghosts and a scene where a catfish performs fellatio on a princess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pleasure over his win from the press is both an affirmation of their high regard for his talent and an acknowledgment that only at a place like Cannes would a truly original and daring artistry like his get recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe was charming in his acceptance speech, evincing that "this is surreal for me," while noting how important this win was for Thailand. "I would like to kiss all of you," he said, speaking to the nine member jury headed by a typically bedraggled Tim Burton. "Especially Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love your hairstyle." He thanked his parents for taking him to the movies some 30 years ago when he didn't even reallyunderstand what a movie was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in a tip of the hat to the film's theme of reincarnation, he said, "Iwould like to thank all the spirits and all the ghosts in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They made it possible for me to be here." DAY TWELVEUN HOMME QUI CRIE/A SCREAMING MAN ** out of **** -- It's curious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Africa regularly produces brilliant authors, playwrights, artists and of course musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its film industry has been hobbled and never flourished artistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the micro-budget movement will enable an artist to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But up til now, African cinema has focused on noble and important issues delivered with stilted acting and rudimentary technical accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Screaming Man is a step forward, with a solid plot about a man in Chad whose life revolves around his job as a pool attendant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's called Champ by everyone because he won a major swimming title in his youth, he was the first pool attendant in all of Chad and he's been working at a major hotel for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now his son works alongside him, but newmanagement demotes him to gate attendant and he's devastated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the country is collapsing as rebels encroach on the government in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acting is better than average for the most part and the story holds your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's something to build on but not on a world class level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Africa's time will come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OUTRAGE * out of **** -- Takeshi Kitano hasn't made a true yakuza film in about a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to report that the time away from the genre has refreshed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kitano's new work is as rote as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is oh so typical: gangsters plotting to take over each other's territory with reprisal following reprisal and broken oaths piling up as fast as the chopped-off fingers delivered as "apologies" for various slights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not one character becomes of interest as either hero or villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We simply watch asthey betray each other again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a way, Kitano is also betraying the genre he once enlivened so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment... 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Kourtney K.'s Stunning Bikini Bod 1 of 8 camille grammer lady gaga natalie portman pregnant raven- symone rebecca budig More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Thousands Of Birds Found Dead In Italy Recommend 32K History Channel Won't Show Katie Holmes Miniseries The Kennedys READ MORE Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo to Guest Star on Hawaii Five-0 READ MORE Lindsay Lohan's Post- Rehab Gift: a $25,000 Necklace READ MORE Lea Michele's Diva Behavior Strikes Again Petra Nemcova Engaged to British Actor Stephanie Seymour Caught Kissing Her Son?
