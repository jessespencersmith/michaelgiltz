Every movie that comes out is hyped as "the best movie of the year" or "the funniest comedy in ages." Every TV show is "the best show on television" or "the best comedysince "Seinfeld." Every book is a masterpiece; every CD is Blonde on Blonde or Sgt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pepper and every blog is "the fastest growing blog on the Internet." Conversely, if something is not brilliant, it'sbad, awful, terrible, and a disgrace to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, the ABC Family drama Greek ($29.99; ABC Family) is...good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not faint praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, most TV shows don't come within spitting distance of "good." It's funny, well-acted and just a little bit smarter than you expect from what is basically a prime-time soap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rusty (Jacob Zachar) is adorky college freshman looking to pledge a frat and just happens to settle on the one led by hisolder sister's ex-boyfriend Cappie (the scene-stealing Scott M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foster who is very appealing and by"appealing" I mean extremely smart and sexy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, Rusty's sister Casey (Spencer Grammer, daughter of Kelsey) has the least-interesting storyline on Greek , which just began Season Two this week (a repeat airs late Wednesday night and new episodesare on Mondays at 8 p.m.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's torn between the super-cool Cappie and Evan (Jake Dorman), the rich boyfriend who cheated on Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gee, I wonder which guy deserves her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a lot more fun to spend time with Rusty, his Christian roommate , his fellow pledge involved in a clandestine gay relationship with another frat boy and Rusty's geeky butcute and very talkative gal-pal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No re-invention of the wheel here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a very strong cast elevates the material from "guilty pleasure" to simply "pleasure." And that's good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: The Kite Runner ($29.99; DreamWorks), a faithful adaptation of the mega- selling novel that was decently written but so melodramatic it put most telenovelas to shame and Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!
