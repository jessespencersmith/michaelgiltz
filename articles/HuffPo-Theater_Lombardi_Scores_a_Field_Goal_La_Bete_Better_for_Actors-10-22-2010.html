(Lombardi can be gruff, to say the least.) And a play structuredaround a reporter spending a week with a subject breaks the crucial rule of fiction: show, don't tell.Instead, almost all we get is the tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shadows in Lombardi's life are revealed, such as a son who feels overshadowed by his dad and a brother who lives in San Francisco, hates football and loves to shop. (Are these supposed to be related?) And clearly when Lombardi is focused on an upcoming game (which is always), he's not much fun to be around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hapless reporter (Keith Nobbs in a thankless role) just seems in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, out of nowhere, we actually see Lombardi doing his job and the fascination that the man holds is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He rips apart two players for arriving at camp early: the happy go lucky Paul Hornung (a charmingBill Dawes) and the slow but sincere Jim Taylor (Chris Sullivan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just when you feel his wrath, Lombardi turns on a dime and woos them with kindness and tough love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, after endless talk describing him as a coach and statistics about what he's accomplished, we actually see Lombardi being a coach and it's genuinely intriguing and dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This happens again when Lombardi upbraids Taylor again and Taylor stands up for his right to be represented by an agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dance of a coach -- father figure and tyrant to the players but also answerable to the owners and yet wanting to do right by his men who go into battle for him week afterweek -- is revealed again, not through a question and some stock answer, but by actually watching him atwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the fatal flaw in Lombardi .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entire play is structured around a reporter digging up info and asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lombardi isn't famous for answering questions, he's famous for being a football coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when we find ourselves bored stiff by the reporter's crisis of conscience, we know it's really gone out of bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the play had focused on one week of preparing for a game and dumped the hoary notion ofa reporter as a device to reveal the Truth, it might have had a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lauria and Light are both pros, who land every joke with precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lauria's pep talks to the team aren't very inspiring, in part because he's talking to the audience instead of the players, but his stormypersonality comes across well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Light is even better as his woozy but perceptive wife; it would be great to see her again in a more demanding role and a better play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobbs hasn't much to do, but the three players (which also includes Robert Christopher Riley as Dave Robinson) are appealing in their all too briefturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Thomas Kail and projection designer Zachary Borovay make clever use of the Circle in the Square dimensions by projecting video right onto the floor of the stage itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for a change thechallenge of the space keeps things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scenes that might have been plainer on a standard stage 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift 1 of 9 jwoww naked miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant snooki nude PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Like 720 Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton Joins Future In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp; Vanessa Hudgens Back On?

(Rylance, not such a fool after all, insists his play was designed to Kourtney K.'s Stunning Bikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER House Of Representatives Facebook Video NFL Gun Control iPad Haiti Earthquake Atheism Sarah PalinHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â»One And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,228 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,031 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 106 Comments PHOTOS: Raven- Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss 532 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 65 Comments Director: 'Ghostbusters 3' Is Happening 88 CommentsComments 1 Pending Comments 0View FAQ seem more flawed on a second viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insert ironic comment here.) Lumley and Pierce battle it out and suddenly the clownish behavior of Rylance has given way to a very real battle royale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pierce stubbornly refuses to back down and gracelessly stamps home his opinion, leaving Lumley no room for self-respect unless she slaps him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly his troupe is not only siding with the fool to protect their meal ticket but seemingly pleased by Rylance's crowd-pleasing nonsense more than Pierce's plays, which apparently are sinking into High Art tiresomeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not quite certain where this production heart lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is Rylance the king of mediocrity or is Pierce a pretentious man too stubborn to give in a little and appease his patron? (Surely Rylance could play a Fool in one of his works.) Or is Pierce the protector of real artistry? The finale certainly suggests so, with the production design of this show grandly revealing him alone on a windswept, stormy landscape like KingLear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pierce's daughter stares at the audience in a confused and perhaps accusatory manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are we toblame? All these ideas could be embodied at once of course; they might all be a little true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's depressingly obvious that the play which skewers or at least raises the question of High Art versus Mediocrity (or is it Pretension versus Fun?) collapses under its own profundity at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, I'd hate to miss these three actors in these roles -- or the troupe when they amusingly dissect acting styles in a marvelous moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Matthew Warchus directs ably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the set and costume design by Mark Thompson does the story no favors with its overblown final image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also find Rylance's outfit a tad too obvious in itsclownishness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, the main set -- a book-lined library that stretches up to the sky - is my idea of what heaven must look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So La Bete is a treat, just a half-baked one. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltzFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Recency | PopularityComments are closed for this entry View All 31 Fans Very Cool :) FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright Â© 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HUFFPOST SUPER USER drxcreatures 03:07 AM on 12/20/2010 Permalink | Share it</p>
