"My hope for the movie was that this was a movie that parents could take their kids to," says Anthony Horowitz, who penned the best·selling Alex Rider books and wrote the script for the film, which stars Alex Pettyter in the title role, along with Ewan McGregor, Bill Nighy and Alicia Silverstone . "That's what 1 was really aiming for when I wrote the screenplay I'm a dad, and I've taken my children to so many films that made me squirm with embar· rassment when my kids were smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The idea was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is a familv film that the whole family can see But does that actually happen anymore')" A good question -do families go to movies to~ether anymore?

"It's very hard nowadays," says Maltin, famed for his authoritative best·selling "Movie Guide." "Everyone seems to agree what is appropriate for preschool. films without "Talladega"·like "edginess" are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This fall's gentle remake of "Lassie barely made a ripple. ers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get very gentle, positive, proactive children's entertain· ment, whether it's Barney or Baby Einstein or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But from age 6 up, appar· ently, it's no holds barred_ I The audience that Walt Dis· ney cultivated and virtually ! owned for decades still exists. "I was discouraged to see that the new 'Lassie' movie was just thrown away," says Maltin "It barely surfaced .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't even get invited to a press screening of it."

Maybe. says Horowitz . "Families naturally are gravitating to· ward these huge blockbuster movies," says Horowitz _ "The movie of the sum­ mer in Britain was without any question 'Pirates of the Caribbean 2,' despite a crit· ical response that could have floored it, frankly -[but] made not a bit of differ· ence to its box-office success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a tidal wave that to some extent took some of our [overseas] audience with it as well." ("Operation Stormbreaker" has al· ready opened in the U.K.) Just as disturbing to Maltin is how the desire to reach the broadest audience possible makes studios rum R·rated mov­ ies into "hard" PG-J3 films and avoid a G· rating at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he takes solace in the success of movies like "March of the Penguins, " and the response he sees to classic entertainments . "There's an annual silent· movie event in LA .. and a lot of families come to see Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd or Bust· er Keaton with a live orchestra," says Maltin "Most of the kids have never seen a silent before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And to hear the kids' laughter -the highest·pitched laughter -above the crowd is hearten· ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says these films still work." • They are family -sort of Aglance at the top-grossing movies of 2006 finds a lot of movies that families watched together -but were they appropriate for everyone? Here's a rundown at recent films and the issues they raise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; M;G. "PIRATES OF THE CARIB­ BEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST" Kids loved Johnny Depp's goofy hero (right) and the silly stunts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adults dug the ironic tone and special effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this PG·13 film still had some. inten-se vio­ lence that made younger kids shiver their timbers. "X-MEN; THE LAST STAND" The finale to the comic-book fran· cllise included all sorts of mayhem, including the traumatic deaths of beloved main charaG­ ters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teenagers got into it, but younger comics fans saw the difference between on·the-page and movie violence. "TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY" Another family favorite, thanks to the goofy Will i'errell, who comes off as the silly older brother every­ one wishes they had_ But this movie had a lot of sexual innu· endo. "Elf," it sure wasn't. "THE BENCHWARMERS" This Rob Schneider vehicle about nerds getting revenge when they finally get to play baseball is filled with family· friendly content: It's all about teamwork and giving everyone a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Disney had made it, it COUld've been G-rated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the studio wanted to make sure Schneider's fans turned up, so they made a cruder PG-13 film. "EIGHT BELOW" Disney's dogs-in-perll adventure had a classic feel and scored well at ttle box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It earned a strong $81 million despite a "soft" PG (because the dogs were in peril and for some mild language).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it proves a family film-can succeed, and tell a cool tale to boot. "SUPERMAN RETURNS" A kid-friendly hero in a flashy revamp, but intense scenes with Lex Luthor. made It much too dark.</p>
