                <p>T U E S D A Y , A U G U S T 2 4 , 2 0 0 4NYC Hospitals Desperately Underfunded ToFight Terrorismby Michael in New York on 8/24/2004 10:18:00 PMIt's been three years since NYC suffered its SECOND devastatingdirect attack by terrorists and still hospitals across the city aredesperately unprepared and underfunded by the federal government."Hospital officials across the city say they still lack much of theimportant protective clothing, decontamination facilities and essentialdrug supplies that could be needed to respond to a biological,chemical or nuclear strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, the federalgovernment said it was essential that the nation's hospitals improvetheir ability to handle complex, catastrophic disasters, and it warnedthe hospitals that they might have to wage that response withoutoutside aid from the government or military for as long as 48 to 72hours after any terrorist attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hospital officials in the city sayWashington has failed to provide adequate direction on how to runsuch extraordinary responses, and have not come anywhere close toproviding the kind of money they say they need."Later, the story adds,"In New York City, a number of hospitals have spent about $5 millionapiece since 9/11 to install decontamination showers, buy protectiveequipment and train staff members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For this effort, they have eachbeen reimbursed roughly $75,000 from Washington, according to Mr.Raske's association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hospitals, which are facing many otherfinancial pressures, say they would have to spend hundreds ofmillions of dollars more to make more meaningful progress towardreadiness."This is just one city, albeit one that has proven the most temptingtarget imaginable for terrorists and one Bush wants to cynicallyemploy as a rallying point for his reelection campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he trulycared about fighting terrorism and truly cared about NYC, where isthe money he promised and reneged on? Where is the attention toreal problems like helping hospitals in major urban areas getprepared for chemical, biological and nuclear attacks?
