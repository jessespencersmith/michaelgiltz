Well, Oskar can deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that she may not be younger thanhim or a girl or a boy or really anything he can quite bring himself to name? Well, give him time.On another level, Let the Right One In is not about friendship or bullying or young romance (truly, it couldn't befarther from that if it tried).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching the film, you come to the unsettling realization that Eli, this creature thatfeeds on blood simply realizes her aging human protector (procurer is more like it) simply isn't up to the taskanymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She needs a new helper and grooms Oskar for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, we see Eli lure adults totheir doom by crying out in a helpless, little-girl voice, "Help me; please, help me!" only to pounce when theycome within biting distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let the Right One In is one long plea from Eli to Oskar, we sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Help me, she issaying but it's not his blood she wants; it's his heart and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How much crueler is that?With Tiffany on board as director, you knew the show would be visually striking and it is, with a snowy wooddominating the stage throughout. (I thought the toasty venue of St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's should have allowed the A/C to run fullblast; if ever a show would benefit from some shivery atmosphere, this is it.) The work of set and costumedesigner Christine Jones (hand in hand with the lighting by Chahine Yavroyan and sound by Gareth Fry andeffective special effects by Jeremy Chernick) was impeccable.The first stumble for me was the music by Olafur Arnalds, which skipped genres and styles in distracting12/16/2015Theater: Your Friendly Neighborhood Vampire; Deadly Da | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=bafc4c10-7684-4f80-9320-ab7d3661f3d7&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4fashion, sounding techno-ish one minute and film score-ish the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically, the action was broken at timesby stylized movement, the sort of signature flourish Tiffany and Hoggett are known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It certainly wasn't anegative in this show, but here those moments felt merely decorative, not integral to the work or revealing of anyemotional undercurrent.More tellingly, my suspension of disbelief didn't ever take place for Eli, played so memorably in the original filmby Lina Leandersson (who was twelve years old when the movie was shot).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benson is not bad in the role (noone in the show is weak, as such).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But her affectless delivery and much older appearance threw off the show forme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looks older than the original Eli (much older) and older than Oskar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that led to cascading problems.With this central relationship not as convincing (and more straightforwardly one of monster and child), thespotlight shone brighter on the rest of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the bullying aspect is the least interesting aspect; Oskar'sparents seem so indifferent and incompetent here you thought more of an after-school special than the complexworld this boy lives in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto, the head bully who is of course bullied even more by his older brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That feelstoo obvious now whereas the same detail in the movie informed a minor character (others have their ownmonsters to deal with) rather than banally explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the staging of the swimming pool finale fell flat,with the stylized choices here by Tiffany not working either as terror or terribly beauty.Ortega is committed to his role, and despite the production's flaws, seeing him wrap his arm around the boxcontaining his "girlfriend" or scratching out a Morse code communication with Eli are creepy, heart-breakingmoments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for all the care that went into it, one doesn't feel this production can stand on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The filmOnce was flawed but charming and a genuinely nutty idea to turn into a stage musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They did it brilliantly.Here, the film was so successful and so rich that surely they imagined the results could only be better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thetemptation of turning a brilliant film into a play is surely an enticing one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet you'd better have a very goodreason for allowing such a magnetic, overpowering presence into your creative life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The belief that you cantransform it or at least partner with it might just turn into the reality that it has overwhelmed you.DA no rating IRISH REPERTORY THEATRE AT DR2 THEATREOh dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some nights at the theater do little but provide war stories for the actors involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That surely must bethe case for night I caught the revival of the Tony-winning Da, produced by the Irish Repertory Theatre (which ishosting its season off Union Square at DR2 while their space is being renovated).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The piece, by Hugh Leonard,is a memory play, with a man who's come to put his late father's affairs in order soon overwhelmed by thepushy, talkative ghost of his dad and a host of memories: his mother, his childhood, his first job, his firstromance and so on.I've never seen Da before but can imagine a sharper revival might coax out the lightning-fast switches inemotion, from humor to pity to anger to sadness to gentle acceptance more fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the performance I caughtwas a series of disasters for all involved, from the unruly audience (one elderly woman kept chatting to herfriend, to cite one example of many) to that disease all actors dread: forgetting your lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It spread faster thanEbola ever did here in the U.S., with almost the entire cast soon stumbling here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When one actor isoff, that can tense up the rest, put them off their rhythm, and soon everybody and their mother is stumbling.This was capped by a Noises Off-like disaster: the door to the home that served as the show's one and only setjammed completely right at the start of Act Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ciaran O'Reilly as the adult son Charlie strode up to the doorand then pushed and pushed and pushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His younger self tagging behind (it's a memory play, after all) urgedhim on. "Give it more of a shove," he suggested as they stood stranded on the edge of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly kickedand shoved and shook the door until the entire set began to wobble whem the other actor (the able AdamPetherbridge) spoke up again: "Maybe we should go in the back way." God forgive me, it was the highlight of theshow.12/16/2015Theater: Your Friendly Neighborhood Vampire; Deadly Da | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=bafc4c10-7684-4f80-9320-ab7d3661f3d7&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/4The poor actors had to enter and exit the house in the most circuitous fashion, with one and all remindedconstantly about the damnable door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They recovered as best as they could, but one could imagine them allbursting out in rueful laughter and downing more than the usual drinks later, praying such a night wouldn't comeagain anytime soon.It's a reminder that every review is just really a review of that one particular night's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I doubtsincerely that this fuzzy revival directed by Charlotte Moore would have garnered much more than two stars outof four on its best night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The play didn't come into focus, and the varied feelings of each scene seemed morehaphazard than purposeful. (I've never seen it before, nor the movie version.) If it wasn't for that stuck door, Iwould have said James Morgan's set was serviceable along with the other tech elements.Beyond the nightmarish forgetting of lines, I would have also noted that the accents on display were far morevaried than usual, with Fiana Toibin as our hero's mom mumbling her lines so much that I imagine the audiencemember who kept talking was asking what the woman had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nicola Murphy's accent as a girl our young herofancies was wandering and quite variable, while I haven't the foggiest idea which of many accents used in onescene to critique Kristin Griffith on.The men, it must be said, fared better in that regard, though the technical issue of accents isn't nearly asimportant as the characters being brought to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petherbridge did well by young Charlie, and John Keating(notably spot-on in both accent and his lines, which is the least one should have to say about an actor) wastypically strong in the role of one-time pal Oliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Gormley as Charlie's first employer actually created aliving, breathing character with Drumm, the lad's first boss and a man who is so snobbish and particular hemanages to close himself off from life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One could be forgiven for thinking his story was the heart of the show.But the heart of the play should be the bantering and battling between Charlie and his Da (Paul O"Brien).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisnight, this performance, it felt rote and unremarkable, one long comedy routine rather than the coming to termsof a son or the last cry of life from the ghost of a dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every show has nights where everything goes wrong.Every cast would prefer to forget them as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such train wrecks can provide great anecdotesyears later but are no fun when they happen and not fun for quite a while after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let's just pass over this nightof Da in silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a memory of one memory play I'm sure they'd prefer we soon forget.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating_____________Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of the forthcoming website BookFilter, a book lover'sbest friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a website that lets you browse for books online the way you do in a physical bookstore, providescomprehensive info on new releases every week in every category and offers passionate personalrecommendations every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a fall book preview or holiday gift guide -- but every week inevery category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals theindustry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'savailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast ofcelebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.Note: Michael Giltz is provided with free tickets to shows with the understanding that he will be writing a review.</p>
