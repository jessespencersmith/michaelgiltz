                <p>By MICHAEL GlLTZ THE new season of "Chap­ pelle's Show" -the hot­ test sketch comedy series on television and a record-set­ ting bestseller on DVD -has been pushed back months from Feb. 16 to late April or May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uiness and a "Sopranos"-like display of artistic control are to blame, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dave Chap­ pelle is under the weather with the flu and borderline walking pneumonia, according to Tony Fox, the executive vice presi­ dent of corporate communica­ tions at Comedy Central.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As well, Chappelle is not sticking to a predictable time­ table for delivering new epi­ sodes of the show, famous for parodying Rick James ("I'm Rick James, b--!") and ex­ ploring issues of race and class with scathing humor. "Dave- and his entire pro­ duction crew for that matter - got a bit of a late start on writ­ ing season three," says Fox. "We're behind on the writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was recently sick for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There had been a built-in hiatus in the produc­ tion schedule for the holidays. "We had about 10 days of pro­ duction left, so we pushed that through the end of the holiday break to give him some time to recover and get some writing time in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll resume produc­ tion in January, so we're not ex­ actly sure what that means in terms of launch date." The first season debuted in January of 2003 and quickly be­ came the cable channel's hot­ test property alongside" The Daily Show With Jon Stew­ art" and "South Park." Season two debuted in Janu­ ary of this year and turned into a genuine phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It regularly drew more than 3 million viewers, and the DVD set of season one came out a month later, quickly becoming the top-selling TV show on DVD of all time (though "Seio­ feld" is expected to surpass it this season).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chappelle toyed with ending the show on a high note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he eventually re-signed With Comedy Central in a prec­ edent-setting deal that paid him to continue as star, executive producer and writer of the se­ ries and gave him a piece of the DVD profits (something even movie stars don't typically get).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two-year deal for 26 shows could be worth some $50 million, depending on sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DVD set of season two has also been delayed to tie-in with the TV launch of season three. "We're still talking to Dave and his team, seeing where we are in the writing," says Fox .. "Bottom line: We're behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If! had to guess, I'd say April or May at the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No later than May." Along with the show, Chap­ pelle has been working on other projects,including a feature film along the lines of 1973's "Wattstax," which fea­ tured legendary stand-up by Richard Pryor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The untitled film -di-rected by Michel Gondry of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" - combines Chap­ pelle's sketch com­ edy with a Brooklyn "block party" con­ cert filmed in Sep­ tember and featur­ ing musical guests like Mos Def (a fre­ quent guest on the show), Kanye West, Common, Erykah Badu and a reunited Fugees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no re­ lease date for the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chappelle's $500,000 book deal with Disney­ owned Hyperion also appears to be in flux.</p>
