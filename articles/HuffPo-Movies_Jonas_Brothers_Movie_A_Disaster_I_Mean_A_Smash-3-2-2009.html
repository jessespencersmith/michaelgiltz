So, they should enjoy it while they can because they will be in Branson, MO before they know it playing to overweight former groupies of theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I actually do think their new album was a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sdefinitely on my list of the best 40+ albums of the year (covering allgenres, not just pop).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I wouldn't be surprised to see them (or Nickor Joe a la Justin Timberlake) continuing on and producing better andbetter music down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OverIt See Profile I'm a Fan of OverIt permalink So it's official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miley's team is MUCH SMARTER than the people running the Jonas Bros. operation! When her movie was released, Miley"s peeps claimed the movie would only run ONE weekend... taking a page out of the Disney script ("see it now, before it get's locked in the vault!").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That brilliant marketing stroke got all the parents out and propelled her movie to #1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And lo and behold, the movie kept playing! Gasp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this economy, only a SEE IT OR MISS IT would get the parents out in droves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boys should have learned how to do it by watching Miley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It it"s ain"t broke COPY IT! Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink That was Disney's call, not Miley's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And given the minimal box officefor concert films prior to her film and the competition they had forIMAX screens with U2 (which people assumed would be a biggerdraw in that format), it was a reasonable marketing ploy and workedgreat, especially given the dearth of tickets for her concert tour making this a must-have for any parent with girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOWEVER, if Dinsey had tried toannounce the Jonas Brothers concert as a one-week only event, it would have been widelyderided and mocked as a cynical marketing ploy they would abandon come week two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thebad press and such would have been overwhelming, tarnishing the JoBro name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smartly, they avoided that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The JoBro team is smart, though I think the upcoming TV series smacks of overkill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They should keep the focus on their music (and a live action comedy directed by theFarrelly Brothers coming up is much smarter for branching out.)
