This is surely one of the first if not the first time an openly gay couple has created a Broadway musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, that happy bit of trivia is the most memorable thing about the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is a spin on the Greek play by Aristophanes in which women strive to end the Peloponnesian War by withholding sexual favors until their men stop fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In our show, new college studentLysistrata Jones (Patti Murin) starts dating basketball player Mick (Josh Segarra) but is, like, totallybummed he and the other guys on the team don't really try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've lost every game this season (andpretty much every game as long as anyone can remember).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before you can say Buffy, the bubblyLysistrata recruits the other girlfriends of the athletes to proclaim "No More Giving It Up" until the guysactually triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of stopping fighting, these girls want their men to start fighting, or at least caring about whether they win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the message of the show is that negatively insisting "no sex until you win" isn't nearly as powerful as inspiring them with love, but it's a long road to get there.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Former 'SNL' Star Makes Shocking Comments About Rape And Gay Friends Mitt Romney To Flood Victim: 'Go Home And Call 211' Paul Ryan Admits Marathon Lie WATCH: Rachel Maddow At A Loss For Words After Clint Eastwood's RNC Speech Eastwood Misfires 35 Awesome 'Simpsons' GIFs Celebs React To Eastwood's Wild SPeech Sarah Palin May Be Done At Fox News: Report Several Reported Killed In New Jersey Mall Shooting DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos September 1, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

He seems like a gay character and you assume he'll fall for one of the guys on the team, but this too is a misdirection sinceXander falls for Lysistrata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all presided over by Hetaira, a Greek goddess of sorts who also doubles as the madam of a whore house the girls turn to for practical advise and the guys turn to for release when the pressure gets too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liz Mikel plays this dual role and despite several unflattering costumes and a character that makes you cringe with its "winking" cliched nature, Mikel through sheer stage presence and charm (and some real pipes) somehow manages to maintain her dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same could be said for the rest of the cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cindy Tolan is the casting director and while almost no one here other than Mikel has a strong voice, they are uniformly appealing as actors and comics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Patti Murin was an understudy on Xanada (which Tolan cast and Beane wrote the book for) and that's no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like Kerry Butler, Murin is a delightful personality who holds the stage with ease and makes this foolishness almost seem worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's no belter but her voice has a charm in the quietmoments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can easily see Murin on TV, film and stage comedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Segarra is weaker in the singing(though also not bad in his one quiet song "When She Smiles") and the book doesn't allow him to reallycreate a convincing jock who is a closet lover of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Segarra has charisma and would have made agood Sweathog in the days of Welcome Back, Kotter -- he plays dumb, but lovable very nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tam has an even worse role, usually saddled with the joke costume of the team mascot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his big number "Hold On," Tam is saddled with ridiculous hand gestures that make it look as if he's interpreting for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He too is not much of a singer but you imagine he deserves better material as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexander Aguilar is by far the best dancer, nicely demonstrated in the song "Lay Low," the closest director and choreographer Dan Knechtges comes to mixing street moves, basketball and traditional Broadway dancing into an interesting mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fairness, poor tunes are hard to build interesting dances around and after two viewings it's still hard to remember any of the musical numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're performed very quietly and without any sense of rockingout by the house band, which may be keeping the volume down so as not to drown out the modest voicesof the cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book is essentially the same as the production that leaped from The Gym at Judson to Broadway, with I think a few modest additions like a joke about the iPhone service Siri and a NewtGingrinch reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About the only interesting element of the show's earlier incarnation was that it was performed in an actual gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Switching to Broadway hasn't been a problem for set designer Allen Moyer but a row of lockers and some hoops don't exactly wow with their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He and lighting designer Michael Gottlieb have added a bank of bright lights at the back of the stage (a la Dreamgirls ) that is seen at the beginning, partially revealed at the end of Act One and fully revealed for the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It adds a little pizazz but clashes horribly with the gym setting and the overall effect is pedestrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes by David C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woolard andThomas Charles LeGalley are fine for the students though again not as regal or sexy as Mikel deserves.On a side note, the ball control of the cast is vastly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before, it seemed unlikely any of them hadever even watched a basketball game, much less played one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across the board, they're much improvedand the audience doesn't need to spend its time worrying about whether they can hold onto the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a pity this show rushed to Broadway though, to be fair, they were misled by summertime reviews that seized on the play as a pleasant diversion and vastly oversold its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second mounting on a smallerscale would have given cooler heads a chance to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the economics of theater in New York City atthe moment mean the risk to reward of Off Broadway just doesn't compute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not to say LysistrataJones would work better in a smaller house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It didn't work in the tiny space below Washington Square Park and it doesn't work here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It simply should have been mounted (and genuinely worked on, ratherthan merely coasting on what they had) so everyone involved could realize there wasn't much there beforethe stakes and cost rose so high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's always good to try your best, but sometimes you have to recognizewhen the game is over and that putting in more effort won't change the final score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
