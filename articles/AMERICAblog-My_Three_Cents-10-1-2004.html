Kerry won! He's got themomentum! Yep, it's not really about my own personal analysis, it'sabout how the general public saw it and how it plays out in themedia.Day One looks great, with most people saying Kerry won the debate.Bush's tired repeating of one or two talking points wore people out.His body language and facial expressions were a catalog ofindifference, pettiness and a man deeply uncomfortable in his ownskin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's probably the worst debating night of his life.Now how do we keep the Bushies from setting up debate two as hischance for a comeback? Keep repeating what John said: all Kerry hasto do is look presidential.Keep saying, "Oh George Bush had a terrible night so of course he'sgoing to do better the second time." Beat them to the comebackstory so that even if Bush shines it's only what the Dems insisted allalong was the least we can expect from Bush. "Remember, he's wonevery debate of his career before these so of COURSE he'll learn fromhis mistakes and end all that wretched body language (weren't thosegrimaces of his a hoot, Matt and Katie?) and do much, much better.Frankly, we're just hoping Kerry can hold his own, Ted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You knowBush is going to improve dramatically in the next debate."Raise the expectations to grandiose heights and then watch him fallshort and admit, gee, maybe he really is in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser Logout from DisqusLogged in asusing Facebook Connect (Logout)Type your comment here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...4 minutes agoFiredoglakeSave American Jobs: Close Your Chase Account -JP Morgan Chase refuses to do what it takes tosave 300,000 jobs and the healthcare of 700,000retirees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I decided today to no longer be a partof that....28 minutes agoDaily Kos"Difference isn't a threat" - Dave Neiwert, theblogosphere's leading expert on the eliminationistmovement, has a typically excellent post about theweekend's tragic shooting at Croo...36 minutes agoEschatonDeep Thought - Why is Chris Hayes always on myteevee?38 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...58 minutes agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S www.TheGodMovie.comFeedback - Ads by Google AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: My Th...http://www.americablog.com/2004/10/my-three-cents.html 1 of 64/6/09 10:10 PM</p>
