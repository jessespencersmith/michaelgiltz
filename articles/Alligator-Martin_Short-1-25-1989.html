                <p>By Michael Giltz It used to be so simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Movie. stars sometimes spent their wan­ ing years on television (see also, "Rock Hudson"), TV stars were always considered too small to fill up the big screen and never the twain would meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But John .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Travolta and Saturday Night Live changed all that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now­ adays, TV stars appear on the sil­ ver screen, movie stars would kill Ito get their own weekly series and V they'd all love to develop a cable special for that cute little idea their cousin in Reno had. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rules changed just in time for Martin Short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His new film, Three Fugitives, opens Friday, marking the latest chapter in a convoluted career that could only occur in the 'BOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Short has gone from -take a deep breath -network television (The Associates) to syndicated TV (SCTV Comedy Network) to late night comedy (Saturday Night Live) to the movies (Innerspace, Three Amigos) to Saturday morn­ ing cartoons (The Completely Men­ tal Misadventures of Ed Grimley) to cable specials (Martin Short's Hol­ lywood) and, presumably, back to the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, while some make the jump to the big screen and never look back, Short isn't one of them. "1 think the mistake that some people going from television to film make is that they don't real­ ize how great TV is and keep doing it," he explained in an in­ terview to promote his new movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Called Three Fugitives, it pairs Short with Nick Nolte in a comedy about an inept bank robber (Short) who is stealing to pay for his daughter's medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He acci­ dentally implicates a seasoned professional just released from jail (Nolte) and the two are thrown together as they flee the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directed by Francis (La Cage Aux Folies) Veber, it is a typical Touch­ stone comedy -low on convinc­ ing characters and high on broad, slapstick humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, slapstick humor is Martin Short's specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prancing ue'II' • .DUli.Y around the set of SNL exhibited Sir~ S~ai RllltIl(JJ(I (JJ(I ~It.: (JJ( «J(t;{,,~ {vrlt, III /yIttil« ~1I1t11( ~ lir tl ialfJJe/ ktt""""~I#'IKIlI. , Agghhhh, I'm off this causes director Veber to pro-we're on show 10 and I nounce h'im "rubber." : " '. t .: '.'J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; W~!e.his first This bounciness must be parr of 11te AssoCitHes - the reason he' stays busy in so a season on ABC, many different mediums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cri~ to be settling in for a lengthy run. ically praised The Completely Men-Short feels the show is jUK-.. tal Misadventures of Ed Grimley is ing to 'tilt it'- a bright light on Saturday morn- "Whether it's a1f"a.i"'~" . ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, most children's Shakeslpe , .. tlItliiJlll shows are so bad that anything remotely intelligent would st~nd out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Grimley is actually 'good . and Short is rightly proud of his work on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the beginning, though, he was less than pleased. "When I first saw the animation, I went, nerspace, with Dennis Quaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was years after he had entered the big time before Short learned his hardest lesson about the vagaries of Tinseltown .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cross My Heart marked his debut as a lead -and in a romantic role, no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A mature comedy produced by Lawrence (The Big Chill) Kasdan, the movie was never given more than a token release by its studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Short insists that he never ex­ pected any more. "I don't think one person involved in that film -(which was about) two people on a date talking about their rela­ tionship -expected it to be any more than it was, which was gen-erally well-reviewed and doing well in rental. "It's not a high-budget film," he said. "You don't expect Top Gun results." Commercial potential is the last thing on his mind when choosing a movie, Short said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NAIl I say is, 'Who's directing it, who's in it, who's writing it, who's editing it?' "The whole thing is the experi­ ence," he continued . "The work that I do in these films In .. 'nl'J .... months of involvement, decislollS t and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You work and grow as an actor; you experience tionships with people. "And if you work as hard and intensely as you can, you're aIUl'flVjl~ better, whether (or not) got distributed correctly. ,UlU. _Ul­ !ice success) has nothing with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You just have to let go or you'd go crazy." gifll'"tw/Io.F q"IMI'ff (!"It) lir ge~ tfataJ.I4f lIiJJ,t MIll( Tfr,e, e"M/!"tJ, !fe,l(tal ;Ift~atiHl(t,q..e.f 0/ EI ~"IM". ~</p>
