Maybe they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lanford Wilson's Burn This was the last major success of the Pulitzer Prize-winner who helped revolutionize Off Off Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the years, it has dimmed in the collective memory, now usually seen as a flawed play galvanized by Joan Allen and especially John Malcovich in a legendary, barn-burning performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any revival worth its salthopes to redeem a show's first success or rescue a work from suchretrospective downgrading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After 20 years away from Broadway,Wilson will have to wait for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The utter lack of chemistrybetween the two leads makes the play confusing to newcomers like myself and leads to all sorts of lazy puns on a production not catching fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell is Anna, a young choreographer in the world of modern dance who shares a loft-like apartment in New York City with two gay men while dating a wealthy screenwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of her roommates has just died tragically and she returns home, having endured a funeral whereit was clear the family never saw their dancer son strut his stuff, can'tor won't admit he was gay and prefer to pretend Anna was the dead man's lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She pours this out to her boyfriend Burton (David Furr)until her gay pal Larry comes home (Brandon Uranowitz, having theMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–¼ 2019 (31) â–º June (1) â–º May (9) â–¼ April (10)most fun in the cast) and pours it all out again to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least the worst is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photo copyright 2019 Matthew Murphy But it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late in the first act, late at night, Pale begins pounding on their door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pale (Adam Driver) is the brother of the dead dancer andhe's nominally there to pick up then guy's stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pale is drunk and belligerent, a motormouth who can't stop complaining in blunt, blue collar terms about the city, the streets, about parking and what about adrink and Anna sure is good looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sparks -- at least on the page --fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now in the play I saw, Pale is a thoroughly unappealing louse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course he's not Anna's type (not officially anyway), but he reallydoesn't seem anyone's type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's dressed like a slob, but is obsessiveabout his pants being kept spotless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pale wears silk shirts of the sort alow-level thug in the mob might wear thinking it's classy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's themanager of a restaurant and I think he said it was in Jersey and I thought, well it wouldn't be in Manhattan, not this bruiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Larry says he's been to the restaurant (twice) and it's quite good, I'msurprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking at him, you'd expect he manages an anonymousItalian restaurant with cheap house wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pale is definitely a character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's loud and tiresome and drunk and angry and maybe sort of sad about his brother dying and maybe youfeel a little bad for him but mostly you just want him to go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thenhe's sitting on the couch with Anna and they're talking and he puts his arm around her and you freeze up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yikes, he's totally misread the situation and how is she going to get out of this him exploding orhurting her or worse? To my surprise, she doesn't want to -- indeedshe's eager to make love to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That one night stand becomes --against her better judgment -- an ongoing fling that threatens to end her relationship with Burton (naturally) but finally unleashes her imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anna's choreography has never been better because she'sfinally feeling something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later I read the script and discover Pale is supposed to be inescapablyTHEATER: "INK" STAINED WRETCHES GET THEIR DUE THEATER: "TOOTSIE" IS A DRAG THEATER: "ALL MY SONS" LACKS A FAMILY THEATER: 'HADESTOWN" FINDS HEAVEN ONBROADWAY THEATER: "BURN THIS" BARELY SMOLDERS THEATER: THE PAIN OF "THE PAIN OF MYBELLIGERENCE"...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: QUESTIONING "SOCRATES" THEATER: "OKLAHOMA!"

Larry "explains" her to Burton late in the show -- he says she'snever had to carry her own passport or plane ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? She's richtoo? Other than a brief reference to her fancy childhoodneighborhood, we don't have the slightest sense that she's wealthy orsheltered or privileged to any particular degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if she is, the lure of Burton is surely lessened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who needs him? Even the music cues are confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's mostly a parade of 80s era songs (Yes's "Owner Of A Lonely Heart," Roxy Music's "Avalon," BruceSpringsteen's "I'm On Fire" and so on) keying us into the late 1987 time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parade of tunes sets the tone for the entire evening, long before the play even starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at the last second they drop in akiller: the moody classic "Pink Moon" by Nick Drake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a great songand it's played just as the lights go down and the play begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If anything is supposed to tip the show's hand, to say "This is what we're about," playing a particular song just as the show begins should be it.But it's most assuredly not a key track from the 1980s, having beenreleased to zero attention in 1972 and finding belated success in 1999via a car ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More to the point, unlike every other song they play, it's not by any stretch a love song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure they even know that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So does this mean the reputation for Burn This should fall further? Not really, not based on a single revival that doesn't work and at least in part for a reason that has nothing to do with the play itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they do it again in ten years and it fails again, then maybe Wilson's final success will slip further in our estimation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, his key role inmaking Off Off Broadway viable will remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
