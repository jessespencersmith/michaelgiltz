                <p>Thursday, June 20, 2019 FICTION Murder at the Magic School In ‚ÄòMagic For Liars,‚Äù a Private Eye Who‚Äôs Not a Dick  June 20, 2019 Michael Giltz Sarah Gailey is far from the first author to cross-pollinate fantasy with the hardboiled detective genre, as Harry Dresden fans would surely point out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in her new novel, Magic For Liars , she tosses in a ‚Äúschool for magicians‚Äù setting and a female P.I., and suddenly she‚Äôs casting a unique spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Philip Marlowe threw down drinks, but he rarely broke down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ivy Gamble, Gailey‚Äôs protagonist, is a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She spends her days chasing after adulterers and other sordidcharacters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a spouse isn‚Äôt furious over their cheating partner, they‚Äôre swearing at Gamble because she‚Äôs tellingthem their partner isn‚Äôt cheating on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work is easy but dirty and Gamble knows she should strive for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And suddenly ‚Äúmore‚Äù shows up in the guise of a new client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion Torres is the headmaster of Osthorne Academy of Young Mages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of her teachers was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the official investigators ruled it anaccident but Torres knows it was murder and wants Gamble to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gamble‚Äôs sister is magical and teaches at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the two haven‚Äôt spoken in years, since their mother died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gamble hates herself for resenting her sister and the opportunities magic opened for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Howcan a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person investigate a school filled with teachers and students who can manipulate, confuse,bedazzle and trick in a thousand different ways she‚Äôd never know?Sarah Gailey Author Photo ¬©Allan Amato 2019 ‚Üê We Got a Great Big ConvoyWell, Gamble is about to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even for a private investigator of the noir sort, Gamble has all sorts ofissues: resentment over her sister, an inferiority complexfor not being magic, alcoholism (naturally), and no lovelife or even friends (ditto).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one case could solve itall‚Ä¶or make things much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you‚Äôve read Raymond Chandler, you‚Äôll plop for much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chandler rarely talked about periods or birthcontrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those matter-of-fact details are just some of thepositives in Gailey‚Äôs book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a few interesting men ontap, from a disgruntled teen boy certain he‚Äôs the ChosenOne to a lascivious teacher named Toff and a rather nicer teacher named Rahul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it‚Äôs the women who intrigue, from Gamble‚Äôs sister Tabitha to the frighteningly persuasive mean girl Alexandria (don‚Äôt call her Alex) to the intriguing assistant to the principal Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Webb, who seems more capableand intimidating than everyone else combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in a plot that involves abortion, and you‚Äôve got a world thatfeels more up-to-date than Lev Grossman‚Äôs The Magicians, which began and ended with the idea that it wouldbe funny if the kids in Harry Potter swore and wanted to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gailey allows a glimmer of hope, yet holds fast to the cynical aura of true noir with conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That‚Äôs admirable and makes up for a plot contrivance or two at the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the only surprise is that Gaileydidn‚Äôt subtitle Magic For Liars ‚ÄúAn Ivy Gamble Mystery‚Äù or ‚ÄúA Mystery For Mages‚Äù or some other clue thatthis is the launch of a series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we figured that one out on our own.
