                <p>Thursday, June 20, 2019 FICTION Murder at the Magic School In ‘Magic For Liars,” a Private Eye Who’s Not a Dick  June 20, 2019 Michael Giltz Sarah Gailey is far from the first author to cross-pollinate fantasy with the hardboiled detective genre, as Harry Dresden fans would surely point out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in her new novel, Magic For Liars , she tosses in a “school for magicians” setting and a female P.I., and suddenly she’s casting a unique spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Philip Marlowe threw down drinks, but he rarely broke down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ivy Gamble, Gailey’s protagonist, is a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She spends her days chasing after adulterers and other sordidcharacters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a spouse isn’t furious over their cheating partner, they’re swearing at Gamble because she’s tellingthem their partner isn’t cheating on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work is easy but dirty and Gamble knows she should strive for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And suddenly “more” shows up in the guise of a new client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion Torres is the headmaster of Osthorne Academy of Young Mages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of her teachers was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the official investigators ruled it anaccident but Torres knows it was murder and wants Gamble to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gamble’s sister is magical and teaches at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the two haven’t spoken in years, since their mother died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gamble hates herself for resenting her sister and the opportunities magic opened for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Howcan a “normal” person investigate a school filled with teachers and students who can manipulate, confuse,bedazzle and trick in a thousand different ways she’d never know?Sarah Gailey Author Photo ©Allan Amato 2019 ← We Got a Great Big ConvoyWell, Gamble is about to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even for a private investigator of the noir sort, Gamble has all sorts ofissues: resentment over her sister, an inferiority complexfor not being magic, alcoholism (naturally), and no lovelife or even friends (ditto).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one case could solve itall…or make things much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’ve read Raymond Chandler, you’ll plop for much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chandler rarely talked about periods or birthcontrol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those matter-of-fact details are just some of thepositives in Gailey’s book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a few interesting men ontap, from a disgruntled teen boy certain he’s the ChosenOne to a lascivious teacher named Toff and a rather nicer teacher named Rahul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it’s the women who intrigue, from Gamble’s sister Tabitha to the frighteningly persuasive mean girl Alexandria (don’t call her Alex) to the intriguing assistant to the principal Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Webb, who seems more capableand intimidating than everyone else combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in a plot that involves abortion, and you’ve got a world thatfeels more up-to-date than Lev Grossman’s The Magicians, which began and ended with the idea that it wouldbe funny if the kids in Harry Potter swore and wanted to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gailey allows a glimmer of hope, yet holds fast to the cynical aura of true noir with conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s admirable and makes up for a plot contrivance or two at the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the only surprise is that Gaileydidn’t subtitle Magic For Liars “An Ivy Gamble Mystery” or “A Mystery For Mages” or some other clue thatthis is the launch of a series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we figured that one out on our own.
