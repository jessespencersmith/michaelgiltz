Novik has you immediately and never falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novelbegins with a ritual: the once-a-decade ceremony when the local wizard (nicknamed the "Dragon") chooses a youngmaid to take away to his tower, where she serves him in ways the locals can't imagine but spend an awful lot of timetrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone simply knows the beautiful and winning Kasia will be chosen and yet it's our narrator Agnieszka theDragon almost reluctantly takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the fate of Agnieszka to the fate of her valley to the fate of the kingdom andindeed the world, the scope of this story slowly but inexorably expands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So does the magic, whether the highlydetailed, scientific magic of the Dragon or the more creative, "instinctive" magic that Agnieszka soon proves adept at.The chapters fly by; in reading it, I kept thinking, "Ok, just one more, just one more" over the two days I gobbled itdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the medieval world Novik creates is as rooted in reality as her Napoleonic one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unlike most fantasy,what I remember best is not the world but the vivid and complex characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In what is ultimately a rather remarkablenovel, I realized there were no genuine villains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh there was danger and evil aplenty (as symbolized by themalignant Wood that encroaches on Agnieszka's valley); armies clash, people struggle for power and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But timeand again Novik reveals characters driven not by a black heart but by sincere if sometimes misguided impulses:indeed, nothing is scarier than someone doing great evil for what they consider a higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also containsromance of a very adult and very believable nature, though as often happens in this book, events are very satisfyingand characters very real but they never seem to do quite what you expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real triumph is at the end whereNovik displays the ability to make understanding your enemy just as thrilling as destroying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love what Novikhas done in the Temeraire series but this is the best single novel she's written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Uprooted has leapt forward to claim the title of Best Book I’ve Read Yet This Year. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving, heartbreaking, andthoroughly satisfying, Uprooted is the fantasy novel I feel I’ve been waiting a lifetime for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clear your schedule beforepicking it up, because you won’t want to put it down.”—NPR “A very enjoyable fantasy with the air of a modern classic . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naomi Novik skillfully takes the fairy-tale-turned-bildungsroman structure of her premise . . . and builds enough flesh on those bones to make a very different animal. .. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vivid characters around her also echo their fairy-tale forebears, but are grounded in real-world ambivalencethat makes this book feel quietly mature, its world lived-in.”—The New York Times Book Review “Novik here delivers a tale that is funny and fast-paced, laced with hair-raising battle scenes and conspiracies; it alsotouches on deeper ecological concerns we grapple with today.”—The Washington Post “Novik takes us on a surprise-filled journey. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The resulting warmth and intimacy provide a nicely nurturingenvironment for her heroine’s…More</p>
