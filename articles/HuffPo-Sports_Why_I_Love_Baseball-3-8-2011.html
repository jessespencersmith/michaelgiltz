(I'm a devoted Yankee fan with two season tickets in the bleachers.) Then another friend sent me the link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I glanced at the rules and info and realized I would never get picked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know a lot about movies and musicand TV and a lot of other topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know a lot about theYankees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But baseball in general? I'm no expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find it challenging enough to keep up with the ins and outs of one team. (Now tennis I could yabber on about....)But one of the questions on the entry form caught my eye: why do you love baseball, in 500 words orless? Why do I love baseball? I suddenly found myself waxing poetic (when I wasn't checking the wordcount).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing brings out the sentimental fool in a fella quite like baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here's what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could have gone on and on, but here it is in about 498 words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you're done, tell me why you love baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHY I LOVE BASEBALLMy love of baseball -- and especially the New York Yankees -- came through the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I grew up in South Florida when there was no major league baseball team based there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until I moved to New YorkCity in 1991, I'd never been to a baseball game -- not little league, not softball, not the minors, not the MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful In Striking Distance Of Obama Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

And you mean it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The winning is sweet, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's not why I go to 40+ games a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the humbling awareness that I can study baseball all my life and still have more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the mini-dramas that take place during every at-bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's watching a player grow and apply themselves and become a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's pinpointing the ones that don't apply themselves; the ones who drive you nuts by squandering their chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sraging at a move of the manager or a trade by the owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's insisting the moves and trades that do workout were ones you championed all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's high-fiving the person next to you when you've never seenthem before and don't even know their name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's starting fresh every spring training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz AOL Real Estate: Prince William and Kate to Live in Royal Mansion TV Squad: Maria Menounos Relives Her Paparazzi 'Wardrobe Malfunction' on 'Lopez' (VIDEO) DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Sam Waterston Saving Easter Islandâ€™s Marine Ecosystems David O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell FDR Said it All in 1936 -- Who Will Follow in His Steps Today?
