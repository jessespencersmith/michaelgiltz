What We Say In this engaging debut, Curtis Craddock creates an Alexander Dumas-worthy tale of swashbuckling and courtly intrigue in a fantasy world of his own devising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find magic and sorcery, devious plots and religious fanaticism -- all the usual bits --but most of all you'll find two winning characters: Isabelle, a princess with a deformed hand and apparently no magic, despised by most everyone around her and Jean-Claude, the king's own musketeer who has devoted his life to keeping her safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It grows a bit talky at the grand finale but before that Craddock keeps his many plates spinning with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wittybanter and quick thinking count for much more here than fancy swordplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

An encouraging fantasy debut. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “A gripping tale of a woman who refuses to be defined by her physicaland magical limitations, thwarting both assassins and all who see her as apawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A great read!” ― Brandon Sanderson “Curtis Craddock's debut is a grandtale of intrigue, adventure, and gaslight fantasy in the tradition of Alexander Dumas.” ―Charles Stross “A settingfabulous and strange, heroes to cheer for, villains to detest, a twisty, tricky plot ― I love this novel!”―Lawrence Watt Evans “In a world shattered by sorcery, a princess without magicbattles for peace, aided onlyby her wits and a drunken sot of a musketeer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Athrilling adventure full of palace intrigue, mysterious ancient mechanisms, andaerial sailing ships!” ―David D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Levine, author of Arabella of Mars “Debut author Craddock’s vivid, fluid prose makes for the best kind of world building....His writing remains buoyant, sweeping the reader alongwith the ease of an airship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isabelle’s dedication to peace and Jean-Claude’s dedicationto Isabelle comprise the novel’s emotional core, even as they flip-flop alliesand adapt to a barrage of shocking twists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Victorianand fantasy fans will eagerly immerse themselves in this first chapter of a striking new steampunk series, whichoffers the adventure of Verne and Dumas coupled with magic.” ― Booklist, starred review “The skullduggery ispleasurably complex, the emotional stakes feelconvincing, and the reasonably happy ending feels earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andwhile Jean-Claude's doggedness in protecting Isabelle is admirable, Isabelle is decidedly and enjoyably not adamsel in need of rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very promising start, both for a series and a new author.” ―Kirkus Reviews, starredreview What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
