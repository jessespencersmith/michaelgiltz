September 21, 2018 Aloha Rodeo! June 5, 2019 Classics Corner:'Hard Times'! November 6, 2018 ‚Üê Is It Time To Kill King Arthur?‚ÄòWW84‚Äô: Wonder Woman‚Äôs Weak 80s Adventure ‚ÜíWestern RoundupThe Library of America !nally acknowledges theWestern novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What took them so long?! December 23, 2020 " Michael GiltzWhat a great reading assignment! Read four classic Westerns from theheyday of that genre both in !ction and !lm, which the Library Of Americahas compiled into one volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed Hollywood had made all four novelsincluded into movies and I‚Äôd seen three of them: The Ox-Bow Incident,Shane and The Searchers.The odd man out was Warlock by Oakley Hall, a novel and !lm I‚Äôd nevereven heard about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quick search showed it is a deeply admired cultclassic, loved by Thomas Pynchon among others and reissued by the NewYork Review of Books imprint NYRB. (Fun fact: that trade paperbackpublisher has never put out a bad title.) After happily breezing through all four books I dove into the introductionby author Ron Hansen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a weird, defensive vibe and I start to wonder,Is Ron Hansen trying to justify the western novel as a genre? Really? All hehad to say was, Read my novel The Assassination of Jesse James By TheCoward Robert Ford because it‚Äôs an f‚Äîing masterpiece, people!But here he is making a mealy mouthed plea for folk to take the westernseriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How is this possible in 2020? Surely, these aren‚Äôt the !rstWesterns the LoA ever entombed onto its list of classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually‚Ä¶.Look at the list of works collected by the LoA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs admirably wide-ranging.You‚Äôve got war reporting, feminist essays, science !ction, books for kids,nature writing, romance, sports reporting, crime novels, !ction and poetryof course, a celebration of the comic strip Peanuts for Pete‚Äôs sake, andmost every other form of writing you can name including letters, oralhistory, and a number I haven‚Äôt mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But until now, no Westerns.Not just no Westerns from the 1940s and 50s, the focus of this set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NoWesterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Period.Head over to the Modern Library, that other purveyor of the acknowledgedcanon as determined by the white men of academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You‚Äôll !nd a wildlydiverse list in terms of genre, but only two Westerns as far as I can tell: TheOx-Bow Incident, again, and Riders of the Purple Sage by Zane Grey, !rstpublished in 1912.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might also count some James Fennimore Coopernovels like The Last Of The Mohicans as proto-Westerns but those aremore precursor than actual Western.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others don‚Äôt count them so I won‚Äôteither.Is it possible the Western is the last genre of !ction that gets no respect?Well, there‚Äôs always self-help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And any time a romance novel is actuallygood the lit establishment hastily re!les it under ‚Äú!ction.‚Äù Still, it hardlyseems possible anyone other than Ron Hansen thinks they need to make acase for the Western, or any genre or type of artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs all worthy, at leastpotentially.Great Westerns are rare accomplishments right along with Wagner‚Äôs TheRing Cycle and New Orleans jazz and the Krazy Kat comic strip and AugustWilson‚Äôs American Century cycle of plays, and you get the idea.The Ox-Bow ponti!cating But what about these particular four novels? All are fun to read and thecollection coincidentally gets stronger and stronger with each novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afterreading The Ox-Bow Incident by Walter Van Tilburg Clark I was tickled todiscover in Hansen‚Äôs essay that the author was a schoolteacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nosurprise there! The novel has a schoolmarm-ish air as character aftercharacter soliloquizes in lengthy, noble speeches neatly detailing what theybelieve and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, the novel even begins with riders coming into townand passing an abandoned church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy-handed symbolism? Check!In the story, two men are swept up in a posse that soon degenerates into alynch mob determined to punish someone‚Äìanyone‚Äìfor the cattle rustlingthat‚Äôs plagued the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The !lm version stars Henry Fonda and HarryMorgan of the TV show M*A*S*H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It improves on the novel in everypossible way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel shows the dilemma these two men face; the moviemakes you feel it in your bones as it relentlessly turns a polite novel ofideas into a gut-wrenching morality play.Come back, Shane Shane by Jack Schaefer is a little better and the movie made from itcaptures the novel very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, that means the novel is just asweirdly hero-worshipping as the !lm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, in the !lm that hero worship ofthe ‚Äúreal man‚Äù Shane is exempli!ed by the kid. (‚Äú Shane! Shane, comeback!‚Äù) But in both !lm and novel, every other person recognizes Shane asa breed apart, a man among men to an embarrassing degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decent,tough, brave-when-he-has-to-be rancher is just as awed and admiring ofShane as the little boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Middle-aged men tongue-tied around Joe DiMaggiohave nothing on the guys in this novel.I‚Äôm happy to read homo-eroticism into just about anything, but can‚Äôt quitebring myself to do it here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The men and women of the novel don‚Äôt lustafter Shane exactly, played in the !lm by Alan Ladd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs pure hero worshipthrough and through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As someone who never put a poster of an athlete ormovie star on their bedroom wall, I can‚Äôt relate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But others can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostpeople consider both the !lm and novel are classics, with the WesternWriters of America naming Shane the best Western of all time.The Searchers I‚Äôll take The Searchers by Alan Le May any day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel and !lm are bothmajor works, with people especially revering the movie as one of the all-time great !lms and the masterpiece of director John Ford and star JohnWayne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wayne plays Ethan, a character maniacally obsessed with rescuinga girl/young woman taken captive by savages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He‚Äôs joined in this years-longquest by Martin, a younger and more naive man who realizes Ethan is sopoisonously prejudiced against all Native Americans that he‚Äôll kill the girl ifshe‚Äôs gone ‚Äúnative.‚Äù By the end, Martin stays by Ethan just so he can tryand protect her not from the Indians but from Ethan, her would-be savior.I could spend hours discussing the di"ering strategies of the !lm andbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like all the novels here, it treats any characters not whitedismissively or indi"erently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That surely re#ects the white people of the1800s and while I want novels told from the Indian and Mexican andfemale perspectives, it seems unsurprising a novel embedded in themindset of the white invaders wouldn‚Äôt be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And make nomistake, Ethan is a frightfully nasty character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs almost shocking JohnWayne agreed to play him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saying Ethan is an anti-hero barely covers it,and both the !lm and novel put him in his place in intriguing ways.Discovering ‚ÄòWarlock‚Äô Finally, as sometimes happens, the novel I never heard of proves the best.Warlock by Oakley Hall is a !ctional retelling of the Gun!ght at the O.K.Corral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hall uses di"erent names because he doesn‚Äôt want anyonemoaning over his lack of historical accuracy.Like The Ox-Bow Incident, it wrestles with matters of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Shane,certain men simply stand out as more of what everyone else wants to beor simply wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Warlock, it‚Äôs hero worship tangled up with bitternessand jealousy and desire and self-loathing, no more so than in the personbeing worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shane himself never seemed perturbed by the idolatryof the men around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And like The Searchers, the violence and tangledplotting of the characters is largely self-destructive, just more all-encompassing too.It‚Äôs a great book and surely belongs on any shelf of the best novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rightalongside Valdez Is Coming by Elmore Leonard and Riders Of The PurpleSage (which saves its animus for Mormons instead of IndigenousAmericans) and The Searchers and Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ohand The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That‚Äôsan f‚Äîing masterpiece too.# You May Also Like $%Tags: Alan Ladd, John Wayne, Shane, The Library of America, The Ox-BowIncident, The Searchers, Warlock Michael GiltzMichael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York Citycovering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports andmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for the New York Post,New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The Advocate,Out, Hu$ngton Post, Premiere Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter,USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He co-hosts the long-runningpodcast Showbiz Sandbox.Leave a ReplyYour email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required !elds are marked *Comment Name *Email *Website Post Comment reCAPTCHAI'm not a robot Privacy - Terms Featured Stories Is It Time To KillKing Arthur?!
