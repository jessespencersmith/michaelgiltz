As the President's spouse?), anyone lookingfor perspective on his personality and presidency would do well HuffPost PoliticsHuckabee's Huck Pac In Turmoil With StaffTurnover, Mounting Debts - Former Arkansas Gov.Mike Huckabee's political action committee, HuckPac, is undergoing a "restructuring," ExecutiveDirector Sarah Huckabee said Wednesday....2 minutes ago Ben SmithGoing small - My story tonight: President BarackObama came alive about 50 minutes intoWednesday night’s news conference – whensomebo6 minutes ago Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Today, srkp23(pulling a double shift), ybruti, taylormattd,ItsJessMe and vcmvo2 combed through hundredsof diaries to find this powerful list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today's...43 minutes ago EschatonOvernight - Folk On.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newish.1 hour ago Crooks and LiarsOpen Thread - Open Thread below...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Next 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: "The S...http://www.americablog.com/2005/06/survivor-bill-clinton-in-w... 1 of 57/23/09 1:03 AMVisit ourAMERICAblog TV site.see all 322 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod For the GOPers, healthcare is politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just Traditional media has todebunk the birthers One small step...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The right-wing media, thevoices of the GOP, in REM - Orange CrushAMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: "The S...http://www.americablog.com/2005/06/survivor-bill-clinton-in-w... 2 of 57/23/09 1:03 AMThe TreatmentObama Has a Grown-UpTalk With America(Gulp)1 hour agoEzra KleinTab Dump5 hours agoWonk RoomSen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Byron Dorgan:The ‘Trade’ InCap-And-Trade ‘MakesNo Sense To Me’6 hours agoHealth BeatTruth Squad: WallStreet Journal HealthCare Editorial Wrong onthe Facts . . .7 hours agoDaily DoseProviders Endorse 'Payfor Value' ProposalsG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
