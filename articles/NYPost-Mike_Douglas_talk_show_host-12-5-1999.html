                <p>NEW YORK POST, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1999 oJs1~1 By MICHAEL GILTZ Talk show icon Mike Douglas is almost always right about who will win the rat­ ings battles -even if it takes the rest of us a little time to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When David Letterman and Jay Leno squared ofT in late night, 'The Post's Cindy Adams caHed up Douglas for his take on their talenta. "I said at the time Leno's going to win it because he has wider appeal: says Douglas, "And then for about a year Letterman ruled that spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now it's aH turned around, and 1 don't know that it's ever going to turn back for David. "I quite honestly watch both of them, and 1 watch David more than 1 do Jay." he says. "I don't know why; he fascinates me. ,MBut . you know' some-thing? When his producer , Bob Morton, left that show, it went straight downhill .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure David knows about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He must think about'it from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's never invited the man back. 1 think that had a lot. to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Producers are very important people." Douglas is in town to pro­ mote "l'\l Be Right Back: a chatty, breezy memoir about his days hosting the most popular talk show of its day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filled with an astonishing number of names from music, politics, and Hollywood, it also fea­ tures his sometimes caustic comment s on the current glut of talk shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no surprise the 73- year-old admires Rosie O'Donnell: She publicly declared Douglas her idol, openly modeled her ~how on his and even wrote the introduction to hi. book. "I lo\'c R9_ie; I !o\'e wh,.l Mh~'~ MilE - -____ !!!!.I DUIIIAS ~~ ~ _----1) IISllHE llEI _ ..... ___ =.1 doing," says Douj!las, w~o's also seen musIcal' hlgh-: lights from his show aired on VHl and a boxed set of episodes featuring John Lennon and Yoko.Ono seH­ ing in stores ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Douglas believes Johnny Carson is the gold standard and that few people -and certainly not the two men duking it out in Carson's old time slot -can mea­ sure up. "I'm sorry," says Douglas. "I like both of those guy_; 1 hel ped both of those guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They didn't invite me on with my book, but I'm not saying this for that rea!!On.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could care less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think the kind of people that will be buying my book are watching those shows HO.'S He was the first syndicated talk show hit, the first to make $1 million a year, and the first to fight off an upstart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who better to straighten out today's crop of gab masters? Douglas, with Muhammad All, pioneered theme shows broadcast­ Ing from different cities, having weekly co-hosts and coming up with \he most unusual mil of guests Imaginable (hello, 'Polltically Incorrect"). . anyway. reach Johnny." .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Latifah, the hO!!t of Bravo's "In the Actors' Studio' - are peoplc not airing yet in Palm Beach, Fla. where be livl ....

"Oprah is unbelievable," says Douglas. "People say. 'Oh, they're paying her too much money.' She's worth every nickel; she wouldn't be getting it if she weren't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shows that she is doing! "One of the first book club shows. she had on the author and all these lovely ladies who'd read the book and in some way it affected their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tell you, tha!"s the best television rve ever Bcen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This woman is a mar· vel; she can handle any sit· uation." Perhaps Douglas can appreciate her innovations because he pioneered so • Conan O'Brien SIdekIck Andy Richter Is". tremendous asset that Conan's going to be missing." .Jay Leno and David' Letterman "I think you could put them both on togeth­ er and they wouldn't reach Johnny carson." • Charlie Rose "You don't meet many people Pika Rose) who listen when they do an interview." • Sally Jessy Raphael "Shouldn't she be running a real astale office In a IInIIi town sornewfIere?" • Oprah "People say, 'Oh, they're paying her too much money.'

Douglas meet many people who lis· ten when they do an inter· view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listen." Indeed, Douglas knows better than anyone that some of the most talented people in the world won't make good talk show hosts. "Sid Ceasar was absolutely brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he could not walk in front of a camera and say, 'Good evening and welcome to Your Show of Shows.' They had to have somebody else do it." While he hasn't seen Martin Short's show (except when he was a guest on it . last week), Douglas thinks that might be the same story again. "What a talent that young man is," aays Douglas. "But that doesn't always trans· late into doing a talk show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a great performer and a funny, funny man. "But rm told, according to my sources the Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety -that it's not doing well ratings·wise." As he points out, if there's just one miss· ing factor -the right producer, the right sidekick - a show simply won't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When told Andy Richter was leaving The Conan O'Brien Show, Douglas knew that wasn't good news for a show he'd enjoyed. "Why is he leaving?" won· ders Douglas. who rattles off the names of great second bananas like Tim Conway and Jonathan Winters who weren't meant to carry a show by themselves. "That's a tremendous asset that Conan's going to be miss· ing." Television's been missing Douglas for too long, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though happily retired, Douglas admits he's occasionally intrigued by the possibility of getting back in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's in no mood to reo enter the grind of a daily show, but a weekly cable program or series of spe· cials does offer temptation .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The c108est he came was several years ago, when a British talk show host aimi· lar to Douglas struck gold by returning to the air after many years away. "She'd play her tape. interviewing Dudley Moore and Peter Cook when they were brash young guys and then bring them on today to talk to them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They w8nted to do the lame thing here with me and I got so excited. "It got 8S far as meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't see how it could have missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had ideas .pring­ ing out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had so and so on and they're .till around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What would they say today? "It could have been 8 great way to pop "back' on there: he sighs.</p>
