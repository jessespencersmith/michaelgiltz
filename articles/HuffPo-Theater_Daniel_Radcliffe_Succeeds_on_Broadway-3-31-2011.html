("F-I-N-C-H," as he so helpfully makes clear to all and sundry.) MatthewBroderick was the last person to lead a revival of the show on Broadway and they pair off well together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither is a born singer but the great score by Frank Loesser is easy on the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both have charm to spare (something Radcliffe reveals here more than ever before) and an easy complicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither is terriblytall, which is especially useful for our hero now; he may be running rings around the competition as herises swiftly to the top of the World Wide Widget company ("www" which gives the whole show a modernflair), but he's also small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though he's smarter than anyone else, you can't help feeling he's anunderdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful InFOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Film | Theatre | Photography | Sculpture | Tribeca Film Festival | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama, Hipsters &amp; Ruin Porn: Highlights ThisArt Bites: Japan Benefit, Trippy Paintings and Bombs, Comics And Sartre: Haiku ReviewsThe Experience Of Posing Nude News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts Like 1 Posted: 03/31/11 04:04 AM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Arts Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 2K Like 20K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCALThe show -- rather sexless in an interesting way - feels as modern as ever, despite silly concerns about songs like "A Secretary is Not A Toy." Looking out for yourself, seeing a company as a stepping stone rather than a home, seeing your coworkers as competitors instead of friends, being so focused on career you don't even bother with a personal life -- sounds familiar, doesn't it? It helps when the tale of a window washer rushing up the ladder of success is filled with fun numbers like 'Coffee Break" and "Rosemary" (in which our hero unexpectedly discovers romance, only to soon put itaside while he leaps ever higher).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Radcliffe's Broadway debut was in Equus , in which he showed a certain amount of stage presence despite being cast as a rough, country lad, a role he most certainly was not suited for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's grown tremendously here and owns the stage rather charmingly, right down to mouthing "cheers" during his curtain call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two other crucial roles don't score highly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rose Hemingway is okay as the secretary who loves him and longs to keep his dinner warm (in New Rochelle!), but certainly doesn't put her stamp on the role or everget beyond a vague niceness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, the main foil for Finch is supposed to be the boss's nephew, BudFrump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the corporate climber we're supposed to dislike -- our hero gets by on his wits and suckingup (cleverly) while Bud just complains to his mother, who is the sister of his boss's wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But ChristopherJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hanke fails to nail almost any of the humor in his part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a handsome fellow but his voice is so-soand his delivery poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lines that should kill just sort of peter out, though he has a good physicalcommand of his body and does well in the dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other key roles are much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmy winner John Larroquette makes his Broadway debut in solid form as the boss, J.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Biggley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without overplaying it, he milks every laugh out of every line he's given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director and choreographer Rob Ashford even makes smart use of Larroquete's height compared toRadcliffe in the rousing Act One tune "Grand Old Ivy." His mistress is played by Tammy Blanchard, whoalso shows wise restraint in a part that can be pure caricature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their romantic number together -- "LoveFrom A Heart Of Gold" -- gets by purely on the chemistry of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a bonus of sorts, Larroquette'svoice is so modest it makes even Radcliffe's singing seem robust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIchael Park (who was exceptional in this season's excellent new play Middletown ) does strong work as a corporate exec and deserves bigger roles in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ellen Harvey has a blast as Miss Jones, especially with her warbling on "Brotherhood Of Man" (inserted perhaps to give some vocal spark to the big dance finale in which Radcliffe shined as a hoofer but obviously could not belt out over that chorus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I keep coming back to the idea that the best actors didn't overplay roles that can be rather broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps it has to do with the sleek, Sixties-mod look of the sets by Derek McLane and excellent lighting by HowellBinkley for this How To Succeed .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They create a vivid, genuine corporate world, as opposed to what I remember as a more cartoonish feel for the Broderick revival. (Which I also enjoyed.) It has the feel Iimagine the new musical Catch Me If You Can will be shooting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ashford's strong staging and choreography are filled with grace notes and clever touches, from the Striking Distance Of Obama Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

Hey, that's the beauty of live theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A great show delivering on the technical front with panache and boasting one of the more tuneful scores in Broadway history can be a lot of fun, especially with a charismatic lead, powerhouse vocals or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if Radcliffe chooses his next role wisely -- a romantic comedy or flat-out farce, I think -- he will continue to grow as an actor and keep packing them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like How To Succeed surely will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when he steps away from the show (as inevitably he will) and they need to find a replacement, might I suggestNeil Patrick Harris?

HAPPY TO KEEP HIS DINNER WARM is also among the dated, sexist songs who's offensiven ess you deem "silly".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nice of you to erase a half century of battling for sexual equality with the word "silly." "Ellen Harvey has a blast as Miss Jones, especially with her warbling on 'Brotherho od Of Man' (inserted perhaps to give some vocal spark to the big dance finale" Have you EVER listened to the original cast album, or seen the movie (which preserves forever Robert Morse's magnificen t, unmatachab le performanc e)? Miss Jones warbling was "inserted" by Frank Loesser in the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has ALWAYS been part of the number - ALWAYS! You want a "silly" concern? Okay, here's silly: In the first Harry Potter movie, Daniel liberates a snake from the reptile house in a zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Daniel opens on Broadway, and, the same week, a cobra "escapes" from The Bronx Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coincidenc e? I think not! There.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's silly. 50 years of feminist gains are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while I don't doubt Radcliffe is good in the role, surely there was at least one American actor in New York who could have toplined in this quintessen tially American role. (Not one word have you written on whether Daniel has successful ly concealed his British accent so utterly, utterly wrong for the role.) But it is nice to have Loesser's great score being perfomed again, even if the sexism now grates rather than amuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strangely, I have never seen the movie and I've never heard the original cast album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My only experience is with the Broderick revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I half suspected it was a standard choice to highlight Miss Jones but didn't have the time or money to check it out -- hence my"perhaps." Thanks for setting me straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can you tell me how those songs play in thefilm? They're so good it's easy to imagine them performed in a winking manner even at thetime that subtly acknowledg es the behavior of the corporate execs as questionab le.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didn't anyone see the lascivious execs as targets at all of satire? Today ,sexual politics just don'tcome into it for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like objecting to Mad Men because everyone smokes and the men chase the secretarie s around the office during holiday parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody thinks it's acceptableRecency | Popularity HUFFPOST BLOGGER Tallulah Morehead 07:12 PM on 3/31/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:24 AM on 4/01/2011Login or connect with: More Login Options Post to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to TypePad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Tumblr.To reply to a Comment: Click "Reply" at the bottom of the comment; after being approved your comment will appear directly underneath the comment you replied to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share your Comment: Post Comment Preview Comment View All 425 Fans 78 Fans 424 Fans 425 Fansbehavior and we're not indulging in fun by watching Mad Men. "Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm" is more complicate d for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Choosing to stay at home and tend to a spouse (and maybe kids) is a perfectly valid choice surely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most competent employees throughoutthe show are the secretarie s who know everything about what's going on, though there's no sense they deserve or even want better. but I'd be happy to my hubby's dinner warmmyself, so don't see it as limiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the songs transcend the era they were written in. "Can you tell me how those songs play in the film?" For Heaven's sake, Netflix the movie and see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you haven't seen Robert Morse play this role, you haven't seen this role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't even have towait for the disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Netflix will stream it right into your computer (I just checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It willstream).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could be seeing it right now, instead of reading this, and see whatwas originally intended, since it preserves the Broadway performanc es of most of the original cast (Sadly, Charles Neslon Reilly does not play Bud Frump in themovie.), and all the Bob Fosse choreograp hy is preserved as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without realizing it, you identified what's still creepy about HAPPY TO KEEP HISDINNER WARM: "there's no sense they deserve or even want better." That's justit, OF COURSE they WANTED better, OF COURSE they DESERVED better, butnot in this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is not one female excutive in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the womenare smarter than the men (But not the boss's sexpot, of course), yet they arecontent to receive less pay and recognitio n? No, that was the myth the show never questions. "De slaves, Dey like being slaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Security! Dem Damn Yankees ruineddeir lives by freein' 'em." The whole show is so cynical in a charming way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's cynical about business and corporatepolitics and who gets ahead and why, I can't imagine why it's hard to think the show is alsocynical about the role of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's certainly easy to play it that way today. (Not that thisone does that as such.) Happily the gains of women, which still have far to go (especiall y around the world) won't be held back by this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I should have mentioned that Radcliffe' s American accent was smooth and didn't raise an eyebrow, one more point in his favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LikeBroderick, he's no musical comedy star waiting for more big roles, but a valid stageperformer, which was more than I imagined after seeing his first three or four turns as harrypotter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Absolutely other performers could kill in this revival, hence my mention of NeilPatrick Harris, who is no older than John Stamos was when he took over for Broderick.He'd be sensationa l in this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks again for properly correcting my lack of musical theater knowledge on that arrangemen t. the movie in its entirety is posted in parts on youtube -- i just recently watched it iffor no other reason than because I found the new version kind of sloppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think MrRadcliff did a fine job, I had more issues with music production and choreograp hy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will sell tickets, so what do I know. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there is no satire in the show to even suggest that the women want a better life or broader choices., let alone eqiuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was alive then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reason we have greater femist roights now is because women back then were NOT happy to keep their dinners warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, in the household I gew up in in the 1950s and 60s, itwas dad who kept the dinner warm, because Mother got home form her job later Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Tallulah Morehead 07:44 PM on 4/05/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:29 AM on 4/01/2011 Permalink | Share it garystartswithg 01:02 AM on 4/01/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Tallulah Morehead 07:52 PM on 4/05/2011424 Fans 425 Fans 78 Fans 425 Fansthan he did every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Mom didn't work because they needed two incomes. it was because staying home doing housework, cooking, and watching daytime TVBORED HER OT OF HER MIND!

Fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Play a Brit, as he didin EQUUIS) NPH is a good casting idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Watch HOW TO SUCCEED the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Morse stamped the role as surely as Brando stamped Stanley Kowalski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one else can touch him. (and I'veseen several others try.) He's in MAD MEN for a reason. (That Robert Morse is also one of my favorite human beings, a truly classy, thoughtful gentleman in every way, helps.)

(The rejiggerin g of NEAR TO YOU into a trio instead of the original duet resulted in a hauntingly beautiful rendiditio n of that song.) The re-arrangi ng of BROTHER HOOD OF MAN also changes the style (and enlages) the warbling of Miss Jones in the Borderick revival as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also something of a "swing" arrangemen t, which was already hopelessly dated when the original opened on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swing was the 1940s, not the 1960s.Loesser's original arrangemen ts, on the original cast album and in the movie, are vastly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Oh and the cobra joke was hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proves you're no muggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Understand , I have no problem with Daniel Radcliffe himself, nor as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's clearly a fine, intelligen t, concientio us young man with solid liberal-hu manist leanings, and a very good actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever seen his DAVID COPPERFIEL D, in which he plays opposite Maggie Smith long before there were any HARRY POTTERmovies?

(Might be too pretty, but he's certainly a triple- threat.) Zac is too pretty....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has to figure out what BradPitt did with his career to not get stuck in the Pretty Boy roles...Which tend to emasculate ...lead actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, the role calls for major comedy chops, as Robert Morse has, not merely being apretty boy who can sing a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zac Efron would be horribly boring in the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He proved he could be funny in Hairspray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bet he could do this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Glad to see Daniel Radcliffe getting generally good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a talented, hard-worki ng actor and he seems like a nice young man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope he continues to make a smooth transition from child star toadult working actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's already made some interestin g profession al choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be fun to see what's next for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know my kids, who are all huge Harry Potter fans, would get a kick out of seeing him on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure there are a lot of similar young fans discoverin g musical theater in New York this spring and summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the best part of his appearance in the show -- lots of Potter fans will get tosee live musical theater they might have waited years to see or never bothered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER inmyhumbleopinion 12:10 PM on 3/31/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST COMMUNITY MODERATOR LeftLeanWing 07:32 PM on 3/31/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Tallulah Morehead 04:18 PM on 4/06/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER inmyhumbleopinion 06:19 PM on 4/06/2011 Permalink | Share it EStreetShuffler 11:56 AM on 3/31/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:30 AM on 4/01/2011 425 Fans But wouldn't it be better if they saw a really good musical production , rather than a sad approximat ion of a show that can be done much better when properly cast?
