Town Hall? He seemed so under-the-radar to me, I was worried no onewould come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd barely seen any interviews with him in the media and every time I mentioned him to music friends, I seemed to be starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I only stumbled on his name in a UK magazine and after purchasing his last album online on the spur of the moment it became my last-minute favorite record of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But was anyone else waiting to see him in concert? I would have expected a much smaller place like Mercury Lounge for his return to New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of a half-empty venue filled with old folkies, the NPR/Richard Thompson set (a.k.a. me), Town Hall was sold out for two nights and filled mostly with young people who had probably discovered TMOEonline just like me, in an organic style that made it seem he was their own personal discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 29-year-old Swede, Mattson sings with an Americana twang, records in English, posts songs online and pairedwith indie labels like Dead Oceans to get the word out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And just like that, he can reach the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here he is trotting the globe and performing in New York the very week that his excellent new album There's NoLeaving Now debuts at #35 on the Billboard album charts. (Sure, these days you can top the charts with less than 100,000 copies in sales some weeks, but still... pretty great.) I haven't anticipated seeing a new act in concert this much in years and Mattson did not disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He prowled out of the wings like a cat and it was immediately clear he had presence to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mattson wouldnot stand at the mike and declaim songs with the faux modest demeanor of a folkie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is a performerand presumably years of dealing with rowdy crowds in bars has paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage was filled with fiveguitars standing in a row on one side (electric and acoustic, each tuned in a different manner) and a pianoon the other he assayed once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mattson soaked up the applause, somehow managing to lookgenuinely touched and as if it were his due at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He immediately launched into "To Just Grow Away," the opening track of his new album, and we wereMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO)FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (27) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA CELEBRITY TV COMEDY FOOD STYLE ARTS BOOKS LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Bobby BowdenHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 06/21/2012 2:39 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storySPONSOR GENERATED POST Like 1k Like 11k Like 76 Recommend 278 Like 1k Like 4kThe Avengers Political Hollywood Electronic Dance Music One Direction More Log in Create Accountoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mattson's voice boomed and swooped throughout Town Hall, merging perfectly with his guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He played with aplomb, easily navigating the annoying whoops of audience members who think any quiet moment is the perfect chance to belt out their approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There isn't an artist alive who wants people to bellow and shout while they're performing -- they're onstage for a reason -- but still yahoos think they must be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was literally one of the most annoying crowds in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kids constantly brandished cell phones to take pictures because of course if you're not recording an event it hasn't really happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guards roamed the aisles with flashlights, repeatedly getting people to desist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a shame they didn't flash the face of the schmuck five rows behind me who spent the entire show shouting out "Ridiculous!" at the top of his voice after every musical passage and then mocking the people around him who weretrying to listen by saying, "It's a concert!" Yes, but not a Bon Jovi concert at a football stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was thoroughly impressed by Mattson's poise throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has the showman's gift for knowing how to ride the wave of audience emotion, pausing just long enough on a held note before launching intoanother passage or raising his vocals a notch to quiet the chatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interestingly, his two forays onto thepiano silenced the crowd almost completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why does acoustic guitar equal rowdy banter but a pianorelative silence? At the end of his first piano number, he pointedly said, "Thank you for listening." The yahoo behind me didn't get the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of those distractions prevented Mattson's performance from being memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Song after song tumbled out of him, including many of the songs on his new album, like upbeat peak "1904" (Mattson had a playful time with his enunciation on that one) to crowd favorite "King Of Spain," heard here on a live performance on the UK show hosted by Jools Holland. (I couldn't find a live performance or video ofsongs from his new album but you can hear more of his work on his MySpace page .) What I was most impressed by after the sheer songwriting talent, singing and playing was his assuredpresence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mattson displayed a wry wit and self-awareness that was striking and funny and whollyentertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the middle of one number, he would suddenly fall into a chair placed towards the back ofthe stage almost as if he'd just discovered it for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A photographer taking a picture became amoment of weird discovery as if he was puzzled to realize people were watching him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'd wipe his facewith a towel and then toss it away with mock disdain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he used a pick, Mattson invariably tossed itaside in anger at the end of each number in a bit that became more amusing every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an artistwith real presence and one you immediately sense you'll be seeing again in concert five years, ten year,twenty years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course at the heart of it are the songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's easy and true to tag Mattson with the Dylan-esque tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this isn't the Dylan of worldly affairs, but the romantic, funny Dylan, the one who can savor love butknows it's slipping away even as he's enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mattson's wife Amanda Bergman performs under thename Idiot Wind, just to make the Dylan reference complete and she joined him on the final number,"Thrown Right On Me" (from his most recent EP Sometimes The Blues Is Just A Passing Bird ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their voices blended beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His new album There's No Leaving Now is a step forward sonically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where his first two albums -- Shallow Grave and The Wild Hunt -- featured simply Mattson and his guitar, the new record features just a tad more instrumentation and the occasional double tracking so Mattson can accompany himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drums, clarinet and the like all make an appearance, but it's a modest one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still essentially Mattsonalone with his powerful, growling voice that can soothe and command and plead in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthat's what we found onstage, a man who can fill a hall with his voice and guitar and stop your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't lived with the new album enough yet but it will certainly be on my best of the year list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tend to recommend Dylan fans start with The Wild Hunt but you can't go wrong wherever you start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because I GOP Approves Abortion Ban Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3Recommend 9k Recommend 693 Like 7k First Video of Snooki With Her New Baby Boy First Look at Snooki's Baby Boy Cocaine Reportedly UsedDuring Prince Harry's Naked Vegas Party 13 Movies That Changed The Way We View Poverty Why We Aren't Playing at the RNC Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Mining the Audio Motherlode, Volume 178 --...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Musicians fix my guitars, perfromers perform for an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get over it, and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are plenty of artisits that encourage an audience, how are people suppose to tell the difference?? 03:52 PM on 06/28/2012 How did you know I'm short? Anyway, every artist and every style of music and everyvenue has their own way of presenting and appreciating music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like every sporting event: you keep quiet during points at a tennis match (usually, though an "ooh" and "gasp" are fine at big moments) and you make a continuous wall of sound at American football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the same way, you shut the hell up during classical music but are encouraged to offer aburst of applause after a solo in a jazz concert or exclamations of pleasure at a gospelshow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're at a Bruce Springsteen concert at madison Square Garden, everyone will clap and sing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're lucky enough to see Springsteen in a tiny club doing an acoustic set chances are most everyone will be hushed and quiet during most songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I cannot stand are people with no consideration for anyone around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When EVERYONE else is listening in rapt quiet maybe someone could show a little considerationfor everyone around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The schmuck at the show I saw felt obliged to shout out duringvirtually every quiet moment and he was the only one out of thousands doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As forphotos, it's explicitly forbidden and security roams the aisle telling people to stop or kickthem out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just feel sorry for people who are too impatient to simply watch and enjoy a performance. 03:54 PM on 06/28/2012 PS How are people supposed to tell the difference? Look around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you're almost alone in acting a certain way at a show, chances are you shouldn't be doing whateveryou're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If everyone is clapping and singing along, by gosh join in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If everyone is being quiet (especially DURING a song), then get clued in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not hard to figure out. 08:50 PM on 06/29/2012 I agree with some of your points but come on MG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TTMOE is NOT classical music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is indie folk, and maybe if people enjoyed his shows more often, he would havesold more albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan Adams has the resume to do such things, and he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristian has a long way to go before he gets in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have been to a number of acoustic, raw, shows and it's a mixed bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half the people lovespeaking out, and the other half hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the other half that hate, mostly justwished they voiced themselves a bit more, they are just to shy to do so. 09:00 PM on 06/29/2012 Furthermore, that classical music venue is filled with 40-100year olds in tuxs.TTMOE shows have 18-35year old fan base wearing shorts and t-shirts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; APPEALTO THE FANBASE!!!! You know this! 11:40 AM on 06/24/2012 when I heard "The Wild Hunt" last year it immediately became my favorite album of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noone is doing folk as good as Tallest Man, he has it perfected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am so excited to see him nextmonth.Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it jjc7550 Permalink | Share it jjc7550 Permalink | Share it Jacob Crim0 Fans 127 Fans 127 Fans 0 Fans 0 Fans 2 Fans06:11 AM on 06/22/2012 Never heard of him and now I wish it hadn't. 11:51 AM on 06/23/2012 Glad I saved you the cost of a CD! 03:48 PM on 06/23/2012 Wouldn't have bought this hipster junk anyway, but thanks for the thought, zippy!
