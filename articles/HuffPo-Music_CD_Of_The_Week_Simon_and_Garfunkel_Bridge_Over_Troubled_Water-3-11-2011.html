And what S&amp;G fan won't want to check this out? The album of course is their crowning work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What makes this modestly priced CD ( $15 on Amazon ) a really good buy, however, are the extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with the CD comes a DVD with more than two hours ofbonus material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Songs Of America is a politically-charged hour-long special that aired on CBS right before the album came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And The Harmony Game is an exceptionally good making-of documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it begins with the music and as Paul Simon reveals the song that came first was "The Boxer." A wealth of detail emerges in The Harmony Game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Producer Roy Halee tells a great story about setting up a drum kit in the hallway right near the elevators to get the booming sound that distinguishes thattrack -- and practically giving a heart attack to a night watchman in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The basic rhythm trackfor "Cecelia" -- hands thumping on blue jeans and an out of tune guitar -- was pulled out of a jam sessionArt and Paul had with friends on Blue Jay Way (the street made famous by George Harrison) when in LosAngeles during the summer of the Manson murders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of the stories will be familiar to ardent fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what producer and director Jennifer Lebeau captures so well -- by interweaving archival footage with new interviews -- is the chemistry between thetwo, their shared sense of humor and give and take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halee is handed his due as well, with both Art andPaul appreciating the ground-breaking work he did for them. (I love the image of Halee wanderingthrough a recording studio and clapping his hands until he finds the echo he's looking for and knowwhere he wants to place the drums and other instruments for a certain song.)

If ever there was a song that begged to be the final cut, surely it was this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the back of my mind, I've never liked the vague, odd lyrics in that third verse ("Sail on,silver girl....").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intellectually, it bothered me, but emotionally of course I went for it every single time.Placing the song at the beginning of the album somehow worked brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it did create the hugeproblem of deciding what song would follow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The choice was Paul's precursor to his work onGraceland . "El Condor Pasa (If I Could)" is an existing tune he wrote English lyrics for; it's so other- worldly and quiet -- and yet with an insistent spirit -- that it eases you back down from the heights of "Bridge." And then they're off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The romping "Cecelia" -- we learn from Paul -- blew the minds of soldiers in Vietnam with its reference to casual sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The smarts of "So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright," the epic feel of"The Boxer," the sheer sonic beauty of "The Only Living Boy In New York," the joy of "Bye Bye Love" andthe gentle "Song For The Asking" come tumbling one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.comStefano Langone Reveals His Relationship Status READ MORE Royal Wedding Guest ListRevealed: Who's Going?
