                <p>Saturday, April 6, 2019  FICTION Young Adult Swish Swish We’ve Got an Abandoned Meeting Hall, Let’s Put on a Show!  March 25, 2019 Michael Giltz Long ago, the British perfected a certain type of children’s book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think of the 1930’s Swallows and Amazons by Arthur Ransome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In that delightful classic, the children of two families meet during vacation and have modest adventures of the sort children have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stakes are typically quite low and thus–to the children involved–immeasurably high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Invariably the kids display diverse and vivid personalities, clash a little, learn a little, andhave a jolly good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When done decently, a book in this genre can be as satisfying as a cozy mystery to Agatha Christie fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When done very well, they can be corkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pamela Brown did it quite well indeed with The Swish Of The Curtain,first published in 1941 (when she was just 16!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Swish Of The Curtain involves best friends from two families who befriend the kids in a third family just arrived at their small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bored and restless, they stumble across an abandoned meeting hall perfect forputting on theatricals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the blink of an eye, the industrious children clean it up, dub themselves the Blue DoorTheatrical Company, create their own evening of entertainment from scratch (including original songs, somedancing, skits, a melodrama and so on) and mount it to roaring approval.Roll credits? Not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the many pale imitations of strong books like this, the evening of the big show would be the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this triumph occurs only a third of the way into the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Brown then depicts how outof sorts the kids are in the days and weeks after their great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading about the high of the big gamefeels familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But reading about the low that can follow feels like a refreshing dose of life as it’s really lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That honest practicality gives this book and its four sequels a unique appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Swish Of The Curtain details the hard work involved in actually doing what they do, even in a small way in a small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our troupeperforms other pieces, so they might refashion a cape from one skit into a skirt for a show months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brownpresents this idea of recycling costumes and props (a mainstay of theatrical companies) without fuss, but it’smerely one element in the novel’s realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The kids fight and bicker, with an unspoken attraction between two of them simmering in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They never act on or even speak of it, which is almost shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More radically, the kids become obsessed withgreasepaint and the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some coolly calculate which courses at school they can backslide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another← This is ‘Us’ ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’: a Cop Show for Kids →intentionally fails an entire year of education to devote more time to the violin, consequences be damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has no intention of going into business and must focus on an upcoming audition for a musical conservatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two years pass, with the kids performing at everything from outdoor fetes to fundraisers to entertaining little kids with a Christmas pageant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the while, their families wait for this silly fad to pass or start putting theirfeet down. “Now enough of this nonsense!” they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Swish Of The Curtain doesn’t suggest following your heart is easy or delightful or destined to pay off, not by any means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it does make clear in a simple, straightforward manner that nothing should stop you fromtrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Substitute any passion for that of the theater and you can imagine how appealing this book is to kids…and how frightening to sensible parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pushkin Press is reprinting all five books in the series this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have kids of your own, beware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pushkin Children’s Books (March 12, 2019) Tags: Pamela Brown , The Swish Of The Curtain Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
