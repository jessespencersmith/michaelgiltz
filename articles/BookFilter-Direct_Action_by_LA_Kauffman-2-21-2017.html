This engrossing account traces the evolution of disruptive protest over the last 40 years to tell a larger story about the reshaping ofAmerican radicalism, showing how the direct-action blockades,occupations, and campaigns of recent activist movements have functioned as laboratories for political experimentation and renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Propelled by more than 100 candid interviews conducted over a span of decades, thiselegant and lively history showcases the voices of key players in an arrayof movements – environmentalist, anti-nuclear, anti-apartheid, feminist,LGBTQ, anti-globalization, racial-justice, anti-war, and more – across an era when American politics shifted to the right, and issue- and identity- based organizing eclipsed… Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say "What happened to the American left after the Sixties?" That is the question that has bedeviled activist and journalist L.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaufmann, who has been on the ground at protest movements ranging from anti-apartheid to ACT UP/NY to Earth First! andbeyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's wrestled with that query for years and the result is this scholarly work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most imagine a splintering of the left from its anti-Vietnam focus to a hundred different issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Kaufmann paints a history of direct action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sees its roots stretching far back, but marks the beginning of the modern era to the May Day protest in DC on May 3, 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Themotto of the action was "If the government won't stop the war/ We'll stop the government."
