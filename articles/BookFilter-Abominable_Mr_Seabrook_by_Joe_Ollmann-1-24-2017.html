(That was only half true -- he ate human flesh, but it was cooked up for him in Paris).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point, Seabrook was among the highest paid writers in theUS and hobnobbed with the likes of Aldoux Huxley, Gertrude Stein, Man Ray and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, he wasShare This Book About The Author Joe Ollmann Joe Ollmann lives in Montreal with his wife and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is the winner of the DougWright Award for best cartooning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $22.95 (Paperback) Published: January 24, 2017 Publisher: Drawn and Quarterly Pages: 316 ISBN 10: 1770462678 ISBN 13: 9781770462670also a dreadful drunk with a compulsive need to tie women up in chains and other restraints, a fact dealt with to varying degrees of reasonableness by three long-suffering wives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe Ollmann's biography of this minor footnote of a talent is both unsparing and kind, treating Seabrook's career with the seriousness it deserves but never using that as an excuse to overlook his sometimes boorish, always self-destructive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ollmann's black and white drawings soften this descent intomiserableness, perhaps by giving us a little distance between the man and his failings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I doubt a movie version would benearly as easy to trudge through the last sad act in which Seabrook drank and drank and finally committed suicide.Somehow, a text biography would become tiresome (how often can you write that Seabrook, yet again, threw up?) while actually watching it would simply be unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A comic book allows Ollmann to simply show Seabrook turning to a trash can yet again or merely looking like death warmed over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visually it's funny, sad, honest and yet offered up with a straight-forward dispatch that needn't wallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do know anyone who reads this first-rate biography will want to seek out his booksabout serving in WW I, travels to the Middle East and Haiti and quite a few more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ollmann brings everything to life: hiswork, his wives, the mistreated employees, the enabling agents and editors, the people he met along the way and especially the frustrating, self-defeating, fascinating and indeed abominable Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seabrook. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us Â©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
