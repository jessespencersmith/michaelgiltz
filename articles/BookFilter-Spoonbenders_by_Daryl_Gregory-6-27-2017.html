(You can't tell if someone is lying when reading a computer screen, so it's kind of awesome for a mind reader who wants to try andtrust her date for a change.) "Spoonbenders" has all the genre-flipping fun the premise suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's also aching and lovely and sweet, filled with memorable characters like grandfather Ted (who was just a card sharp and con man when he met the love of his life, a woman with real psychic powers), Irene (who had to grow up too fast when her mom diedbecause even being the World's Greatest Psychic won't protect you from cancer) and Buddy (the child cursed withknowledge of the future who must desperately plan for the climactic showdown and pray he doesn't forget something).Highly recommended. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Masterful. . . . gracefully balances the outrageous melodrama of Chicago mobsters and shadowy government agencies with the ordinary mysteries of family dynamics. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Readers will emerge from the fray sure they knoweach Telemachus down to the smudges on their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A skillfully written family drama that employs quirk andmagic with grace.” —Kirkus Reviews (Starred) “This gloriously imaginative novel featuring a family of somewhatreluctant psychics has a nifty trick up its sleeve—as whimsical and eccentric as the Telemachus family is, theirhopes and desires perfectly mirror our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spoonbenders is hilarious, heartfelt and brimming with humanity.” — Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney, New York Times bestselling author of The Nest “Imagine amazing powers—but do so with uncommon creativity, rigor, and humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might, if you're lucky, arrive at the delicious drama of the girl who can smell lies; the all-at-once-ness of the boy who can’t not see the future; the great dilemma of the psychic pressed into service as a spy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daryl Gregory's novel traces the line where gift balances against curse andby the end, we realize he isn’t only talking about amazing powers after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spoonbenders is X-Files… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
