We know he performed in front of the Queen of England but how did that happen? We know for one brief happy year he was making six figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But doing what? Was he a recording artist a la Luther Vandross? A member of a group? A backup singer? A theatrical performer inshows? (That apparently, is the case.) We know he's gay but whether he's single and unlucky in love or happily partnered remains another mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the picture is very incomplete.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) GOP Approves Abortion Ban MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Slash Caught Fellow Rocker Naked With His Mom DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in AmericaFOLLOW USArts Books Film Architecture Music TV August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA ARTS TV BLACK VOICES LATINO VOICES RELIGION COMEDY LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Bobby BowdenHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 07/14/2012 12:16 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyLike 1k Like 13k Like 1k Like 101 Like 4k Recommend 9k Recommend 292 Recommend 699 Like 239More Log in Create AccountWhat we do know is that Kendall can sing and hold a stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show really comes to life in the all too brief moments when he plays other characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A straight-talking Latina neighbor who calls everyone"gurl" is such a clear high point of the show that she's brought back for the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quick sketches of hisgrandfather and others also score strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Kendall had created a show where he brought to life the people of his apartment building, peopling it with a string of characters, it might well have proven far more illuminating than his personal struggles with weight loss and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As that neighbor, he's hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kendall also shines when bantering with the audience in a stand-up style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freed from baring his soul, he's just plain funny and compelling and suddenly he's a person we actually want to learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the few songs that delivers is "Walk-in Closet." It's just a ditty really but as Kendall dives into it he says it's pretty catchy, isn't it? Yes, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's one of the few songs that stops the introspection long enough to create a strong chorus and melody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a lesson in that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I look forward to seeing Kendall again in a show where he puts his talents to use bringing other people to life; that's when we get to know him best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FLAMBE DREAMS ** out of **** THE 45TH STREET THEATRE Well, you have to give it points for originality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flambe Dreams is a silly -- but not quite silly enough -- musical about a young man with serious OCD issues who longs to become a maitre d like his late father, who perished in a freak flaming bananas foster fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His journey takes him from a small town in Middle America to New York City and the famed Le Cirque restaurant with stops along the way for friends, food and quite a few pills of Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero's name is Joe and he's played by Jarrod Spector, who has played Frankie Valli on Broadway in Jersey Boys , among many other credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He probably loved playing someone so innocent and gullible after the high drama of that show and is unafraid to make Joe a naif who knows a lot about flaming desserts but very little about anything else, including girls or even who Jay-Z is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a clinging mother and a serious regiment of pill popping, Joe takes the plunge to follow his dream, heads toManhattan, befriends the pharmacist at a Duane Reade (where he is probably their best customer) and works his way up from a tea shop to a noodle shop to his lifelong dream of being an honest to goodness maitre d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main problem is that Joe is a little too much of a naif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a rather sexless character (though Spector himself is very appealing indeed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A romance might be blossoming with that pharmacist Gloria (Jillian Louis) but only on her part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gloria quite fancies Joe but when she disappears he only seems upset because it throws into disarray his daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Joe storms out of the Duane Reade in fear andanger, it's not thwarted romance you think about, it's a guy who needs some serious therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only genuine heat is generated when Joe goes online and meets a girl who has a thing for maitre d's (God bless the internet; it has someone for everyone).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their online musings about a potential date are the emotional high point of the show and isn't that telling? Throughout Joe's mother (Catherine Cox) keeps in touch, worried about her son, pushing him to take his pills and ultimately and unsurprisingly hopping on a plane to check up on him before his dreams -- or perhaps even Joe -- go up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I mentioned, the main problem with this musical comedy is that the romance at the heart of it never even begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there are others, mainly a confusion about the show's message. it says that Joe's motherHOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 2 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan Oasis 2012 Net Neutrality Anatomical Wonders Barack Obama Natural Disasters Barack Obama 2012 MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Slate Articles »What Would will.i.am Sound Like OnMars?
