-- a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The more we admire her, the more wewonder what she sees in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The London production decided there was no problem and presentedBertram with his warts and all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love isn't logical, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, they emphasized his youthfulimpetuosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He may behave like a cad from scene to scene, but at least we know he believes in his ownpassions -- however much they may be the opposite of what he swore to believe a minute ago -- down to his core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so here, where Bertram is more typically calculating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Cullum and Tonya Pinkins are strong in their significant roles as the mother of Bertram and the King Of France, especially when Cullum gets to drop the hammer on Bertram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gets a little lively at theend, when all the couples are intertwined for good (whether they like it or not), but the show takes toolong to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And look at Reg Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He plays a cowardly friend of Bertram's called Parolles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comic relief, Parolles came to life in London as a real person, not just a fop to make sport of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That made his humor funnier andhis comeuppance more painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, Rogers is just a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in Measure for Measure , he plays Lucio with more subtlety, getting more laughs and creating a genuine man in the process. it's typical of director David Esbjornson's more thoughtful work in Measure .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show begins with demons prowling the stage (our inner id or at least our fear of sexual desire made manifest).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They prompt the Duke (Lorenzo Pisoni) to high it out of town and put his confidant Angelo(Michael Hayden) in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Duke wants to see how Angelo with perform and expects a man of suchsober character can clamp down on vice more convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angelo outlaws all fornicationoutside of marriage, which soon means he must execute a fine young man Claudio (Holland again) whohas impregnated his fiance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Claudio begs his sister Isabella (Danai Gurira) to plead for mercy fromAngelo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To his shock, Angelo finds himself deeply, furiously desirous of Isabella and says he will spareher brother's life if she gives up her maidenhood to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh the villainy! The show has a vague rock and roll feel, with punkish, comically sexual costumes by Elizabeth Hope Clancy, a memorable music and sound score by John Gromada (aided by Acme Sound Partners strong sound design) and even endingwith the Rolling Stones performing "Sympathy For The Devil" (a bit of a stretch, that one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exceptional Dakin Matthews does his usual yeoman's work in dual roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carson Elrod has fun playing a male prostitute, Pompey, wandering through the crowd and teasing the audience during onescene, offering his services to a hulking executioner in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Manis -- just like Rogers -- createsa more believable dullard (and therefore a funnier role) in Measure than he did in All's Well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pisoni is a very unmemorable Duke; it's almost a surprise at the end to realize this is his play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He deliversthe poetry and music of Shakespeare, rather than the meaning -- always a fatal mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not bad,just not nearly as good as his two main costars in Measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as the actress Annie Parisse did MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?
