No, He's the New Sondheim!Theater: Hamiltons Miranda Is the New Biggie Smalls? No, He's theNew Sondheim!HAMILTON *** 1/2 out of **** RICHARD RODGERS THEATREHamilton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've heard of it, I think? Yep.So I can skip the preliminaries, like the plot description or explaining what's exactly going on here and cut to thechase. [Here's my review of the Off Broadway run if you're one of the four people who hasn't heard aboutHamilton already.]Is every Broadway show going to include freestyling from now on? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Lin-Manuel Miranda isn'tthe next Biggie Smalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the next Sondheim (or to avoid such dizzying expectations, he has the talent tofollow in Sondheim's footsteps).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton isn't The Blueprint slapped onto Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a full blown Broadwaymusical, with elements of Brit-pop and girl group sounds and good old-fashioned show tunes and yes of courserapping in various styles.Listen closely and what you'll hear above all is a fresh new voice that is building on Sondheim's legacy: thewhip-smart lyrics, the marvelous word play, the intelligence, the building of melodies that are catchy but neverbanal, the deployment of lines and hooks like depth charges that repeat again and again throughout a song andthroughout the show until they have a remarkable power and emotional intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, Hamilton has a lotmore in common with Sunday In The Park With George than It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back.This isn't to downplay the central accomplishment of creating the first great musical that employs hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buthe's not just doing a hip-hop show that's playing on the Great White Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They did Tango Argentino onBroadway and people loved it, but it's not like every show now includes a tango salon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One-off shows in aparticular style don't change Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a full-on Broadway musical that incorporates a style that's fresh toits audience (albeit one long-established) can change it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miranda has grafted a strand of hip-hop ontoBroadway's DNA and it's going to stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same happened with Hair and Grease and others embracing rockand roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That genre of music and style of singing became part of Broadway's vocabulary, just as jazz and r&amp;band country and other genres have intertwined with old style belting over the years.Some great Broadway talents simply can't sing in a rock and roll style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'd be useless on a show likeNewsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others can't do country or jazz or soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everyone belongs on The Wiz revival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has nothing to dowith age or talent; some people just don't have the voice or affinity for certain genres. (You hear it time andagain when opera stars make the awful mistake of tackling pop tunes.) And operetta is beyond many -- that'sclearly why the delightful musical On The Twentieth Century hasn't been done in dog years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One needs aparticular refined skill to assay it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes one needs a very refined skill set of swagger and excellentenunciation to tackle the complex lines and internal rhymes of Hamilton and hip-hop in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everyBroadway wanna-be has this in their quiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But from now on, they're going to have to try.We all know why some say hip-hop makes sense for this particular show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Founding Fathers were badmother f***ers! They laid it on the line! They were scrappy and bold and risking it all with their backs against the12/16/2015Theater: Hamiltons Miranda Is the New Biggie Smalls? No, He's the New Sondheim! | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=4b24698f-db26-47e5-bc01-654784f556e1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/6wall and looked down upon as Johnny Come Latelys by their betters! In short, maybe it's sort of a fluke that thestyle works so well for an era once enshrined by the very old-school musical 1776.Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hip hop works for this show because Miranda wrote it and he's good and because he used hip-hop as avehicle for revealing character and pushing the story forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine a musical set in France, a show about thecourt of the Sun King where withering put-downs and dexterous word play were prized above all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hip-hop?Freestyling? It would work like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine a show about scientists, maybe the Manhattan Project or ashow about Isaac Newton or Galileo or maybe string theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In science, scholars debate and claw at oneanother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creating a vivid, convincing picture of your theory is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And tearing down someone else's ideais just as important a skill as building up your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rap battle? Makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A show about newspaperreporters today or during the tabloid era of the 1970s or back in the Roaring 20s when (I hear) reporting wasglamorous and fun and actually paid well? Yes, I can imagine hip-hop working well there too because whosavors language and slang and cutting retorts more than reporters? A hip-hop Taming Of The Shrew? It'sprobably already being written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hip-hop musical for the American Revolution is no more incongruous than rockn roll as a source for the music in Spring Awakening, a show based on a German play from 1891.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let's put torest the idea that hip-hop will only work once in a blue moon or when whomever took an option on the movieStraight Outta Compton brings it to Broadway.In the same way, the diverse casting of almost everyone but white guys to play these iconic roles works notbecause of any particular political context it creates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It works because color blind casting (or here, color-centriccasting, casting with purpose and in celebration of color, not mindlessly pretending it doesn't exist) works foreverything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller because when the material is classic and the performers are good,new layers will always be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, it only works when the performers are good because no show worksunless the performers are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And this cast is great.NOTE: Here's casual video of Lin-Manuel Miranda and the delightful Jonathan Groff entertaining the hundredswaiting in hope of winning a $10 front row seat to the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something like this happens every day outside thetheater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try as you might to hate a show with all this hype and with endless stories in media outlets that nevertalk about Broadway, but when you see something cool like this, darnit, you just can't.Okay, so on with the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton is an orphaned immigrant, penniless but intellectually vibrant anddesperate to contribute, desperate to take part in the American Experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His first friend when arriving in NewYork is the cautious Aaron Burr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their lives are intertwined as each succeeds and plays a major role in theRevolution, with Hamilton somehow always one step ahead of Burr and so on and then in comes Lafayette andWashington and Jefferson and King George gets huffy and you know the rest.Hamilton is sprawling and messy and deliriously ambitious and flawed -- of course, it's flawed! You can't pushboundaries without stumbling briefly here and there -- and very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw it at the Public and held back onraving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes the bolder a film or TV show or novel, the more you want to catch your breath and hold off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asecond viewing of a movie, waiting five or ten episodes into a season, living with an album for a while, all of thatcan make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes, flaws become more pronounced and the shock of the new becomesless shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other times, a second viewing of a movie or repeated spins of an album deepen yourappreciation and bolster your confidence that this is indeed the shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton is indeed the shit.When I saw it at the Public, I knew it would be among my favorite shows of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I felt it could be betterin varied ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothing else, the cramped space of the original venue was not ideal for the heavy wooden setdesign of David Korins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It felt a little dark and oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this transfer, almost everything on Broadway isbetter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miranda -- who wrote the book, music, lyrics and stars as Alexander Hamilton -- refined and tightenedevery element of the show. (I would dearly love to see a breakdown of all the changes lyrically and musicallyand book-wise.) The performances are sharper and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set can breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience isecstatic, electric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Producers and The Book Of Mormon were super-charged smash hits that broke through12/16/2015Theater: Hamiltons Miranda Is the New Biggie Smalls? No, He's the New Sondheim! | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=4b24698f-db26-47e5-bc01-654784f556e1&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/6to the popular culture that is now usually indifferent to musicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rent was an obvious precursor in the game-changing role of stamping rock and roll as music that belongs once and for all on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I have to goback to Angels In America for a show that felt this charged and this important both culturally and politically andespecially theatrically.And what a cast! Anthony Rapp was in the audience the night I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And just like Rent, I'm certain this showhas launched the careers or boosted the fortunes of any number of performers on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christopher Jacksonas George Washington has gained in stature since the Public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before, his Washington seemed to fade into thebackground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he looms like a fatherly presence, wise and a little intimidating.In the dual roles of the brash Hercules Mulligan and the reserved James Madison, Okieriete Onaodowanremains a droll pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it possible Leslie Odom Jr. is even better as the wily, put-upon Aaron Burr? His storyfeels more balanced and empathetic, more of a mirror to Hamilton instead of just a foil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burr reflects the cynicalmodern politician and Hamilton the ideals of passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet he's not just a bitter Salieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Burr hadn't fired thatfateful, fatal shot, he'd be remembered more highly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no one seeing his show-stopper "The Room Where ItHappens" -- it stops a lot, this show -- will forget how Odom captured Burr's ambition and insight and frustrationover being bested yet again.Certainly RenÃ©e Elise Goldsberry couldn't have improved as Angelica Schuyler, the woman who sacrificed herattraction to Alexander Hamilton so her sister could be happy and her family's fortune secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She isincandescent, both enchanting at good ole Broadway belting and sensational at rapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldsberry has verveand punch and diction so crystal clear (thank you, classical training in the fundamentals!) that her flow puts mosteveryone else to shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, Daveed Diggs steals the show as both the outrageously fun Marquis deLafayette in Act One and the aristocratic, combative Thomas Jefferson in Act Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's hilarious in the first actand then tops himself with the second-act opener "What'd I Miss." Miranda naturally is the heart and soulthroughout, singing with the shy awkward voice of a teenager and gaining in confidence throughout without evercalling attention to the slowly evolving growth of our protagonist.And I'd like to make a personal apology to Jonathan Groff for the modest doubt that was in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BrianD'arcy James was so...so delicious as King George at the Public that I was crushed when he left for SomethingRotten and bummed that friends wouldn't be able to see his indelible turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How would they get someone withenough star power to put over such a fun, if secondary role? Well Groff has the star power and I've been a fanof his on every conceivable level since Spring Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But still I thought, "Damn, I wish James were still in it.He was perfect."Then out comes Groff and he's a sheer delight as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's younger but this works perfectly, emphasizing thespoiled child aspect of King George.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Groff delivers completely in the part, which emphasizes what a gemMiranda created and how good Groff is when given material this sterling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus the Brit-pop nature of his tunesare a savvy respite from the delightfully dense, but sit-up-and-pay-attention rap lyrics that dominate the show.Along with Goldsberry's singing at key moments and some other islands of pure singing, Groff's scenes allowthe audience to catch its breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess someone else down the road will make the most of it too, but now Iwant everyone to catch Groff in this role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who'd want to miss a sexy, slightly mad King George? Not me.If King George and his signature tune "You'll Be Back" and the monarch's other reprises were merely the comicpleasures they are, that would be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But typically for this show, they're so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along withtunefulness and full-on comic relief, like everything else in this rock solid creation, George's tunes advance theplot, provide context and underline the high-wire nature of what the rebellious colonists are attempting.Think about what they accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The King's petulance and expectation of unquestioning allegiance makesclear why they would rebel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His unnerving threats to crush them militarily make clear how fraught with dangerthe situation would prove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George's malicious glee over the utter mess that faces them after "winning" -- having12/16/2015Theater: Hamiltons Miranda Is the New Biggie Smalls?

(Maybe it was just asecond viewing when I knew what to expect, but I imagine a change in pacing and trims here and there are alsoresponsible.) Ditto the death of Hamilton's son in a duel that cruelly echoes his own fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first time, I found itdrawn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time, thanks to improved work by actor Andrew Chappelle and perhaps some tightening andtrimming of his big scene(s), it works better.Mind you, I remain utterly indifferent to the choreography of Andy Blankenbuehler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It leaves me just as cold onBroadway as it did at the Public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't hurt the show, simply because it feels like mere background,something one can ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't think of a single scene where the endless popping and modern moves of thechorus added emotionally to the events taking place (though director Kail uses them well for crowd scenes andtransitions).Ditto the set, which is far less oppressive in the big space of the Richard Rodgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less oppressive but not lessinteresting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a wooden walkway that encircles the back and sides of the stage and is mostly underutilized.People are often positioned up there to stand and observe the proceedings below but essentially they just fadeinto the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, rolling wooden platforms very rarely come into play and the one visual flourishthat made good use of them has been cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd sooner see it all removed and no audience would be the wiser.The costumes of Paul Tazewell are excellent throughout, with the notable exception of the female dancers in thechorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still don't understand the artistic choice that has some of them wearing pants and vest akin to the menwhile others are unnecessarily garbed in what are essentially undergarments.Certainly the musical direction and orchestrations of Alex Lacamoire work in ways large and small to get acrossthe gorgeous score while supporting the actors and allowing the lyrics (surely among the wordiest in Broadwayhistory) to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not to mention embodying a range of styles with nimble conviction! It's extraordinary work Iam ill equipped to parse but appreciate nonetheless as boundary pushing in its own right.Less positively, Phillipa Soo as Eliza Schuyler and the future Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hamilton remains a weak link bothdramatically and voice-wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's clear why her big number "Burn" is one of the few in the show to receive tepidapplause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be fair, it is in part a combination of playing the less interesting role of dutiful wife and playing itopposite Goldsberry who becomes an undeniable star in front of our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And only more careful listening willprove this, but I think the melodic lines of Eliza may also be the only awkward and weak ones in the otherwiseexcellent score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the bright side, Soo holds the spotlight at the finale much more convincingly now, thanks to12/16/2015Theater: Hamiltons Miranda Is the New Biggie Smalls?

All those cavils are exciting! The choreography and the set and even one of the leadsaren't ideal? And the show is still terrific? As I said before, it's a treat to see Miranda in this role and his innatelikability shouldn't be underestimated in putting the show forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I still think the prickly role he has createdwill draw even better performances from other actors down the road; he is great casting and I wouldn't miss himin it for the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unlike say John Cameron Mitchell and Hedwig where it was hard to imagine otherstackling that part (an idea that now seems silly, but still), it's not only not silly to imagine other actors playingHamilton, it's fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's created a great role in a great show and people will be playing that part for all its worthfor many, many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's only counting the actors who will appear in this production.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2 Parade in Concert at Lincoln Center ** 1/2 Hamilton at the Public *** The World Of Extreme Happiness ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year 1915-1940 ** Verite * 1/2 Fabulous! * The Mystery Of Love &amp; Sex ** An Octoroon at Polonsky Shakespeare Center *** 1/2 Fish In The Dark * The Audience *** Josephine And I *** Posterity * 1/2 The Hunchback Of Notre Dame ** Lonesome Traveler ** On The Twentieth Century *** Radio City Music Hall's New York Spring Spectacular ** 1/2 The Heidi Chronicles * The Tallest Tree In The Forest * 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1941-1965 *** Twelfth Night by Bedlam *** What You Will by Bedlam *** 1/2 Wolf Hall Parts I and II ** 1/2 Skylight *** Nellie McKay at 54 Below *** Ludic Proxy ** 1/2 It Shoulda Been You ** Finding Neverland ** 1/2 Hamlet w Peter Sarsgaard at CSC no stars The King And I ***</p>
