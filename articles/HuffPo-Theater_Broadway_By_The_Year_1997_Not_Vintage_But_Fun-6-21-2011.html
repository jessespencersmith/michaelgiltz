"Don't Take Too Much" and "The Oldest Profession" aren't truly great songs but these two pros made them feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As good as they were, they didn't make me want to see a new staging of The Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's exactly how I feel about Titanic and Steel Pier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw the under-appreciated Titanic in its original production and while the numbers done this night didn't exactly sell the show, they reminded me how special and somber an offering it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steel Pier was more of a crowd pleaser, thanks to Karen Ziemba reprising some of her great work on that Kander &amp; Ebb show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vocal arrangement on "Satin Doll" (from a Johnny Mercer tribute called Dream ) was fun, aided nicely by the hoofing, including an appealing Drew Humphrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor Christina Bianco was saddled with one of Elton John's weakest pop hits, "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?" from the blockbuster The Lion King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It really shouldn't be performed, but if you must, a very light touch is called for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bianco delivered it with intensity and drama, which made the tune all the more insufferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She won the crowd back with a jokey "duet" with her inner Kristin Chenoweth on "Two Little Words," also from Steel Pier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found it too shticky but the audience ate it up; if Forbidden Broadway were still around, she'd have a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show ended with "The Circle Of Life," which if you've seen The Book Of Mormon can't help bring a snicker as you remember their mocking tune "I Am Africa." (Maybe that's why Lillias White sat out thefinale yet took a curtain call.) But the highpoint looked on paper like a gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The musical Sideshow was about conjoined twins, played famously by Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here the number was performed by Tyler Maynard of Altar Boyz and the very handsome David Burnham of the current Cy Coleman tribute The Best Is Yet To Come (which also includes Lillias White).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clever, I suppose, was my thought upon seeing the pairing for "Who Will Love Me As I Am?" But it wasn't a stunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They turned the tune into a powerful duet thatworked wonderfully, the sort of moment any Broadway show would kill for -- a great song delivered withpassion by two fresh talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are the two original Broadway stars performing the song on Rosie .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maynard and Burnham were terrific, even though the dashing Burnham has never wondered in his entirelife if someone would just love him as he is -- the answer has always been, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the sort ofperformance that keeps you coming back to the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up next in July is a three-pack of shows by Siegel,including his annual look at some of the best new talent from theatrical institutions around the countrycalled Broadway's Rising Stars .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 One Arm *** Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark * 1/2 Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?
