Or at least on Dancing With The Stars? (Every show features a healthy dose of Leguizamo as a dancing fool.) He gives the answer in the enjoyable new show, Ghetto Klown .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous shows -- Mambo Mouth, Spic-O-Rama, Freak , and Sexaholic...A Love Story -- showed us Leguizamo's childhood, his family and friends, his world.Ghetto Klown certainly includes plenty of return visits from his family and friends (and making peace with his father).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's essentially his creative biography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We watch Leguizamo goofing around on the streets and getting arrested when he commandeers a subway train PA system to do a stand-up routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wise school-teacher sends him to acting class and before youknow it, Leguizamo is studying under Lee Strasberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The heart of the show is Leguizamo's up-and-down love affair with acting as he struggles to turn minor bit parts into something interesting and maybe graduate from drug dealer to an actual character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He getsall Method-y on the set of Miami Vice , butts heads with Steven Seagal and Kurt Russell on Executive Decision and in the funniest moment drives Al Pacino nuts during Carlito's Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This clip about the show has a few choice curse words and is NSFW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump Rip Each Other In Heated Political War Of Words PlayStation Network Could Be Down For Days FOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Tribeca Film Festival | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: The Funniest People Not On TwitterMiranda Kerr &amp; Orlando Bloom Step Out To 'The The Funniest Someecards For Easter 2011Weekly Roundup of eBay Vintage Clothing Finds News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts SHARE THIS STORY LikeOne like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sign Up to see what your friends like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 20K Like 4K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCALAll of Leguizamo's characters are presented with affection, even a best buddy who breaks with him after 30 years of friendship over business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true for the stars Leguizamo skewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Seagalwon't be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when smoking pot with Kurt Russell or getting into a tussle with Patrick Swayze onTo Wong Foo..., Leguizamo invariably takes himself to task more than anyone else and often let's themshare advice he would be smart to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sensitive celebrities might take offense, but that would be theirmistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of Leguizamo will enjoy hearing the latest chapter of his life, especially one that fills in theblanks on his career and doesn't mine the same territory he'd probably exhausted by the time ofSexaholic .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newcomers can get a good introduction, though the show doesn't bite as deeply as his best work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why isn't Leguizamo a bigger star? Lots of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was hard to get interesting roles as a Latino (he was always going up against Jimmy Smits, Benecio Del Toro and a handful of others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leguizamo took along time to learn how to work the system to improve his part without annoying others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had authorityissues (thanks Dad) that made him butt heads rather than being smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he had a lot of growing up todo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show ends with Leguizamo in a strong relationship (not to mention with a painfully funny phone sex anecdote) and a new revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His one-man shows always seemed like a refuge, something he would turn to when he became frustrated with the lack of success in movies or TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the light bulb has gone off for him: with his particular gifts, live theater isn't just an escape, a release from the grind of his "real"career as a movie star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On stage, sharing his life?
