A better, headier comparison is Hilary Mantel's "Wolf Hall." Granted, this is a far more muscular tale with rousing action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the characters are notably complex and the best fun comes in watching Rangvald struggle with his own blunt nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alwaysa better adviser to others than for his own cause, Rangvald rises in stature almost despite himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His sister is equallycompelling while Solvi, Oddi (Rangvald's caustic friend), Harald (the boy who would unite all the land under his rule) andothers prove just as memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find heroes and villains aplenty but they're filled with satisfying contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly, this story very loosely based on scraps of history is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'll take two more novels to see if Hartsuyker can deepen and enrich the world she's brought to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's off to a very good start. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúA spellbinding evocation of a long-lost world of magic and blood feuds, populated by characters riddled with doubt and human failing beneath their epic exteriors.‚Äù - BookPage ‚ÄúMaking her fiction debut, Hartsuyker, who claims descent from Norway‚Äôs first king, writes an absolutely top- notch Viking saga, and readers will eagerly await the next two volumes in this trilogy.‚Äù - Library Journal , starred review ‚ÄúA terrific historical epic‚Ä¶Posing thoughtful questions about the nature of honor and heroism, and devoting significant attention to women‚Äôs lives, the novel takes a fresh approach to the Viking adventure genre‚Ä¶Theaction scenes will have the blood humming in your veins.‚Äù - Booklist , Starred Review ‚ÄúSteeped in legend and myth, Hartsuyker‚Äôs debut is a swashbuckling epic of family, love, and betrayal that reimagines the Norse sagas‚Ä¶.While Hartsuyker‚Äôs prose is straightforward, the plot is as deliciously complex as Game of Thrones .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, in an era so dominated by the tales of men, it‚Äôs nice to see a complicated, cunning heroine like Svanhild swoop in and steal the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hold on to your helms and grab your shields‚ÄîHartsuyker‚Ä¶ More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
