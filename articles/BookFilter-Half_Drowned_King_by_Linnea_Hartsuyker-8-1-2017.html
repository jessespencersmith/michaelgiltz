Set in an era when Vikings roamed the seas for plunder and their land wassplit into countless little "kingdoms," the story focuses on two siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rangvald is a strong warrior but is betrayed by a step-father who wants the lad out of the way so his own, weaker sons can inherit the family estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another warrior -- Solvi -- wounds Rangvald and tosses him in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But our hero survives, becoming the half-drowned king of the title andvowing revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, his proud sister Svanhild -- bereft of father and now her brother-protector -- proudly flees toShare This Book About The Author Linnea Hartsuyker MoreLinnea Hartsuyker can trace her ancestry back to Harald Fairhair, the first king of Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She grew up in the middle of thewoods outside Ithaca, New York, and studied engineering at Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a decade of working at Internet startups and writing, she attended New York University and… Release Info List Price: $27.99 (Hardcover) Published: August 01, 2017 Publisher: Harper Pages: 448 ISBN 10: 0062563696 ISBN 13: 9780062563699avoid a forced marriage, only to find herself dependent on Solvi...and liking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With battles and numerous leaders jostling for power, easy comparisons include "Game of Thrones" (minus any fantasy elements) and of course the TV show "Vikings." A better, headier comparison is Hilary Mantel's "Wolf Hall." Granted, this is a far more muscular tale with rousing action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the characters are notably complex and the best fun comes in watching Rangvald struggle with his own blunt nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alwaysa better adviser to others than for his own cause, Rangvald rises in stature almost despite himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His sister is equallycompelling while Solvi, Oddi (Rangvald's caustic friend), Harald (the boy who would unite all the land under his rule) andothers prove just as memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll find heroes and villains aplenty but they're filled with satisfying contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly, this story very loosely based on scraps of history is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'll take two more novels to see if Hartsuyker can deepen and enrich the world she's brought to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's off to a very good start. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “A spellbinding evocation of a long-lost world of magic and blood feuds, populated by characters riddled with doubt and human failing beneath their epic exteriors.” - BookPage “Making her fiction debut, Hartsuyker, who claims descent from Norway’s first king, writes an absolutely top- notch Viking saga, and readers will eagerly await the next two volumes in this trilogy.” - Library Journal , starred review “A terrific historical epic…Posing thoughtful questions about the nature of honor and heroism, and devoting significant attention to women’s lives, the novel takes a fresh approach to the Viking adventure genre…Theaction scenes will have the blood humming in your veins.” - Booklist , Starred Review “Steeped in legend and myth, Hartsuyker’s debut is a swashbuckling epic of family, love, and betrayal that reimagines the Norse sagas….While Hartsuyker’s prose is straightforward, the plot is as deliciously complex as Game of Thrones .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, in an era so dominated by the tales of men, it’s nice to see a complicated, cunning heroine like Svanhild swoop in and steal the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hold on to your helms and grab your shields—Hartsuyker… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
