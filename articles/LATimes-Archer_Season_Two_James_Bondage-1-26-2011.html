                <p>MOVIES TV COMICS GAMES "Archer" (FX)‘Archer’: The sexed-up spy show returns Thursday night on FX Jan. 26, 2011 | 12:28 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz checks in with a feature on “ Archer ,” the ribald FX spy show that might just as well be called “James Bondage.” Start with the unflappable cool of Matt Helm , add the rapid-fire dialogue of “ Moonlighting ,” mix in enough raunchy sex to make even the cast of MTV’s “ Skins ” blush and you’ve got “ Archer ,” the animated comedy that begins its second seasonThursday at 10 p.m. on FX .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmy-nominated for the voice workof lead actor H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Benjamin , Archer sprang from the mind ofcreator Adam Reed (“ Sealab 2021 ” and “ Frisky Dingo “) who has given us a series about a spy,Sterling Archer , who pioneered the tactical turtleneck, repeatedly shootsco-workers when they get on hisnerves, sleeps with his mom’ssecretary but refuses to remember hername (in retaliation, she keepschanging it) and says things like, “Sure I crashed a few cop cars, rode over a few mimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don’t play by therules, mother! But I get results!” Really, though, the show was hatched with just one basic idea in mind: “The 3 11 10« PREVIOUS POST E-mail Print Read Later Latest MOVIES Oscar nominations: the fanboy view[updated] » TV Catwoman’s blessing: Julie Newmar saysAnne Hathaway will be ‘marvelous’ » COMICS ‘Inuyasha’: A farewell to Rumiko Takahashi’s feudal fairy tale » GAMES Marvel vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capcom 3: It’s Doctor Doom’stime » advertisement Marvel vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capcom 3: It’s Doctor Doom’s time »‘Inuyasha’: A farewell to Rumiko Takahashi’s feudal fairy tale »Fantastic Fourmember offed -- but for how long? »BLOG INDEX genesis of Sterling Archer was trying to see how big of a jerk I could make a character and yet you still root for him,” says Reed, who turns 41 just as Season 2 hits the air and is still waiting forhis batch of Season 1 DVDs from Fox Home Entertainment . “You know a lot of it isn’t his fault because his mother is such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of it is Jon Benjamin’s delivery; he can say themost horrible thing and it comes out … oddly charming.” The same can be said of the entire series, which is basically a workplace comedy that just happens to be set in a spy agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sterling Archer (a.k.a. “ Duchess ”) is the top field operative and very good at his job (though we do get many flashbacks to Archer screwing up previous missions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His ex-girlfriend Lana (Aisha Tyler ) is Archer’s equal in every way as a field agent and now dates the nerdy but well-endowed Cyril (Chris Parnell ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archer’s mother ( Jessica Walter ) runs the agency ISIS when she isn’t busy trying to date the heads of almost every other spy agency around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This doesn’t begin to scratch the very adult surface of a show filled with the sexiest cartoon characters ever shown on TV, who are often nude (with coyly placed objects to keep things all basic cable), not to mention office drones who engage in constant sexual shenanigans involvingchoking, robotic arms and enough inappropriate overtures and blatant harassment to keep HRbusy for years.@LATHerocomplex Magneto's triumph: Michael Fassbender to star in RidleyScott's 'Prometheus' http://t.co/yRkKK1l -6 hours ago @Brunetteinc I like the way you think. - 6 hours ago @TeenageSatan666 I have fear in my heart - 6 hours ago Comments Bobby on ‘Archer’: The sexed-up spy show returns Thursday night on FX The Crypticum Keeper on Leterrier’sdream: An ‘Avengers’ epic told in fourfilms over one summer [updated] Kathy on ‘Captain America’ title will bechanged to ‘The First Avenger’ inRussia, South Korea Gabriel on Christopher Nolan takesflight with Superman: ‘We have afantastic story’ [UPDATED] jack on ‘Captain America’ title will be changed to ‘The First Avenger’ inRussia, South Korea 'Red 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea 300 2011 preview A-Team Addams Family Alan Moore Alexander Skarsgard Alex Pham Alex Ross Alice in Wonderland Alien Amy Kaufman Andrew Garfield Animation anime Anne Rice Ant-Man Anthony Hopkins Archer Archie Arnold Schwarzenegger Artist at Work Art Spiegelman Asterios Polyp Astro Boy Avatar Avengers Back to the Future Batman Battlestar Galactica BBC Ben Fritz Berni Wrightson Betsy Sharkey Black Panther Blade Runner Boom!

"Archer" (FX) “FX was very cool during the whole thing,” says Reed, who is based in Atlanta, where the entire series is made and animated. “They said, ‘Don’t worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a marathon, not a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About midseason, they said, ‘We do hope however that we’ve found the floor.’ Then, for whateverreason — word of mouth — it ticked back up and just cleared the bar for a second season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We had10 weeks to chew our fingernails down to the quick.” After just a few weeks off, they launched into production of Season 2. “I am writing number 11,” Reed says. “They ordered 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We are recording Episode 10 starting tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Episode 9 is beingstoryboarded … well, storyboards being placed against the audio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There’s a lot of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I justwent to the mix for No. 7 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And No. 8 is somewhere getting animated, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s hardfor me to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always have to be reminded of what episode we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We havea staff of about 40 very talented young animators in a great big studio in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’m lookingat them right now, hunched over their tablets drawing furiously.”Caprica Captain America Charles Burns charles schulz Charles Solomon Chloe Moretz Chris Columbus Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Chris Lee Chris Pine Christian Bale Christopher Nolan Christopher Reeve Chronicles of Narnia Chuck Jones Clash of the Titans Claudia Eller Clint Eastwood collecting Comic-Con Comic Book Store Clerks of America Conan conferences/panels conventions Coraline Cosplay Cowboys and Aliens Creature from the Black Lagoon crime Crime comics Daniel Craig Daniel Radcliffe Daredevil Dark Horse Dark Shadows Darwyn Cooke David Duchovny David Eick David L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Noire Last Airbender League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Lego LeonardTodd 0 Report Reed got his start at Turner Networks , where he met his collaborator and Archer’s executive producer, Matt Thompson .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were in charge of the library and used to take old cartoons home, drink beer and watch episodes of TV shows people hadn’t seen since the 1960s. “First day on the job, I walked in fresh-faced and eager to work, I met [Matt] and he said, ‘Come on, we’regetting out of this place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I’ll tell you the ins and outs so you don’t have to work too hard.’” So suddenly a kid who rarely read comics or watched cartoons but spent most of his childhood dreaming of becoming a private eye like on “ Simon &amp; Simon ” or “ Magnum P.I .” found himself in the world of cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led to their “ What’s Up, Tiger Lily ”-like spin on the old cartoon “Sealab 2021,” “Frisky Dingo” and now “Archer.” Reed is coy about Season 2 but offers up these tidbits: somebody at ISIS has fathered an illegitimate baby, Archer and Lana go on missions to Gstaad and Louisiana, Archer’s manservantWoodhouse gets an origin story episode, and late in the season Archer gets a love interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you can expect catty comments from co-workers like Pam, the dumpy HR manager who wants to sleep with anyone and everyone, or Gillette , the sassy gay worker who gets on like gangbusters with Lana but can’t stand Archer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reed created the role of Gillette just so he could get back to performing. “I did the voice of the hero and the villain in ‘Frisky Dingo,’” says Reed. “I missed not getting in the booth and goofing around and subsequently getting paid for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I essentially wrote Gilletteinto the scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My girlfriend gets unnerved when she watches the cuts of me doing Gillette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She says, ‘That sounds really authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go grill something.’” – Michael Giltz RECENT AND RELATED ‘The Cape’: Frain gets bad after ‘True Blood,’ ‘Tron’ “The Cape,” “No Ordinary Family” take flight “No Ordinary Family” runs on Chiklis power“True Blood” star finds voice in “Red Hill” “Sherlock” brings a new, cranky genius to TV “Walking Dead” takes zombies to new level “Walking Dead” aims for Gary Cooper in hell MORE IN: TV , ARCHER SEX TELEVISION Comments (3) Sort by: Date Rating Last Activity · 9 hours ago This series is hilarious!
