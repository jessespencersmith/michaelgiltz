THE GIRL IN THE SHOW By Anna Fields$26.99, Arcade Publishing Showbiz ain‚Äôt easy for anyone, but it‚Äôs even harder on women and even harder on women who are funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucille Ball once said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not funny at all; what I am is brave,‚Äù by which she meant,in part, she was brave to look foolish and silly on camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, it does take bravery to step upto the mic of a comedy club, step in front of a camera and mug for laughs, or step onto a stage.This cultural history of women in showbiz focuses on ‚Äúthree generations of comedy, culture, andfeminism‚Äù because, yes, women are funny and the fact that they have to say so proves feminismis still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It leans more on artists like Tina Fey and Ball, but groundbreakers as long ago asFanny Brice and Mae West found more freedom in the old days on stage just as female artiststoday get more room to grow in the rough and tumble world of improv rather than in movies,where they‚Äôre always asked to be the Wife or the Girlfriend and stand to one side and lookhelpless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look funny? You got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helpless? No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT PLAYS 2015‚Äì2016 Edited by William W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demastes and John Patrick Bray$19.99, Applause Theatre and Cinema BooksApplause‚Äôs annual collection of the best short plays produced around the country is essential for anyone wanting to spot the future superstars of theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone from Tennessee Williams toNeil LaBute has made their published debut thanks to this series, and it shows no signs oflagging now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUEEN OF BEBOP: THE MUSICAL LIFES OF SARAH VAUGHAN By Elaine M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes$27.99, Ecco Vocalist Sarah Vaughan ‚Äî nicknamed ‚ÄúSassy‚Äù ‚Äî was once just a singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll came along and a great divide opened up; suddenly, people like Vaughan were jazz singers,people like Doris Day were for old folks, and the kids only listened to artists who wrote their ownmaterial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Vaughan and others like her proved the keepers of the flame for the GreatAmerican Songbook, the treasure trove of tunes written by the likes of the Gershwins and ColePorter and Irving Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or as we call it, musical theater! Vaughan was a trailblazer, one of theearly pioneers who helped desegregate radio (yes, radio had to be desegregated), all whileswinging the songs that made their debut on Broadway in shows that came and went but willnever be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This biography gives Vaughan her due in a way the stage never can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peoplehave tried to create a stage musical around her life but who the heck can sing like Sassy?
