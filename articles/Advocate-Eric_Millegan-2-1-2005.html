                <p>&amp;h#fl.â‚¬GtrHarold I Maude (}ut talent Eric Millegan tells all about playing Harold in a new musical version of the'70s cult classic film By Michael Giltz arold, and Maude-the cult classic 1971 film staxring 70- something Ruth Gordon and 2Gsomething Bud Cort as un- conventional lovers-is start- ing to sing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new musical version with book and llrics by Tom Jones (of The Fantasticks fame) and music by Joseph Thalken just opened at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It mns through February 6, with Oscar- winner Estelle Parsons (Bonni,e and C\yde) as Maude and rising star Eric Millegan as Harold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though the movie isnt gay, it has al- ways spoken to gay viewers-including Millegan, who remembers that when he first rented it he did so because a new friend (now his parffrer of seven years) said that he'd be perfect as Harold if a musical version were ever made. "It's about'Be with the person youre in love with.' It doesn't matter if she's 60 years older than you or, if you're a gay man, if it's a man," says Millegan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His favorite song in the show, he adds, is "the last song that Maude sings to Harold, called 'The Chance to Sing.'I ttdnk that will be the favorite of a lot of people." Millegan prepared for the role of anIntemet-surfing mash;rbator in the movie On_Irine by ctntting up men in a "bear" chat room-not to mention tearing off his shirt and shoving his hand down his pants for the audition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you might wony atrout his preparations for playing the depressive-before-depressive-was- cool tlarold. "IVe played a lot of suicidal people, actually,' says a laughing Millegan, who was bom in New Jersey, raised in Ore- gon, and now lives in Manhattan. "I was suicidal n On_ILine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did a workshop a few years ago [in which] my character actually shot himself in the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I must project something." Unlike Harold, Millegan has nothing to be sad about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's appeared in a se. ries of high-profile workshops lately, in- cluding a new musical version of Mask by BarryMann and CynthiaWeil; his Au- gust birthday celebration performance in a cabaret got efeat reviews; and being out in the media hasn't slowed down his career one bit. "One year [after coming outl," says Millegan, "I have the best job IVe ever had."
