HD-DVD is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long live Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Toshiba throwing in the towel on HD, everyone is asking me again: should they plunge into Blu-Ray? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm a little bummed the more consumer friendly HD format died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It often contained a regular DVD version of the movie, so you could build your library even before you bought an HD player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best ofall, it got rid of the stupid region coding which makes DVDs from overseas incompatible withstandard players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So theoretically if there were a UK TV show or Japanese anime or Australianminiseries you wanted to buy that wasn't going to come out in the US for years if ever, you could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blu-Ray has won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes, Blu-Ray is adramatic improvement over regular DVD.Unfortunately, you have to spend literally thousands of dollars on a plasma or LCD TV, surround sound and a new Blu-Ray DVD player to get all those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On top of it all, Blu-Ray (like HD), is nearly 50% more expensive than regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's right, DVD sales have stopped explodingdramatically so the bright idea of the studios to goose them is to introduce a format that costs thousands of dollars to watch and is a lot more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yep, they think Blu-Ray is so wonderful you'll want to spend a lot more money on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no intention of replacing all my DVDs with Blu-Rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe for a handful of special titles, like The Lord of the Rings and (the original) Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most movies? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDs were a once in a lifetime phenomenon where everyone replaced virtually their entire collection of LPs withmore expensive CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regular DVDs were one of the most successful product launches inelectronics history for a very simple reason: they were a quantum leap better in quality comparedto VHS, they included tons of extras that VHS never could, they came out at a sale price muchquicker (VHS often took six months to a year to come down from the "rental" price of $100) and ontop of it all (and this is what they always forget) DVDs were the same price or cheaper than VHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Get Alerts of big news events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter your email address SNL: Madonna And Reality Star Jade Robert De Niro Alex Da Silva,Almost none of that is true for Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blu-Ray is a much improved picture, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the extras aren't much different than what we normally get. (Despite some bells and whistles more exciting to them than us.) It takes a majorinvestment to get all those benefits and on top of it all, they're more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think Blu-Ray will flop a la the "improved" CDs record labels tried to push on us in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthey might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they certainly won't start flying off the shelves and it will be years before even halfof all homes can watch Blu-Ray DVDs on a home theater system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I say, drag your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The longer we take to make the switch to Blu-Ray, the more likely they'll lower the price so it's the equivalent of regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if the studios think we're all going tohappily replace our library of movies and TV shows on DVD with Blu-Ray, they are in for a rudeawakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: George Clooney's Michael Clayton ($28.98/$5.99 Blu-Ray; Warner Bros.) is such an intelligent, adult legal thriller it seemed to come from a different era; German Expressionism Collection ($69.95; Kino), an exceptional boxed set of four German masterpieces in terrific prints with loads of extras, including the iconic masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caligari (1919) and G.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pabst's Secrets Of A Soul from 1926; Ang Lee's dry but intelligent spy romance Lust Caution ($29.98; Focus), which isn't defined by its sexual explicitness any more than Brokeback Mountain was simply a gay cowboy movie; Father Ted: The Definitive Collection ($79.98; BBC Video), the UK sitcom about Irish priests that leaves Catholics in particular helplesswith laughter; Walker ($39.95; Criterion), director Alex Cox's oddball biopic about the dictator of Nicaragua (embodied by Ed Harris) with a thunderous score by Joe Strummer of the Clash; Kurt Cobain: About A Son ($19.99; Shout), is a dream-like meditation on Cobain that uses audio interviews and virtually no images of the artist or his band in concert but rather focuses on theplaces he frequented to commune with his lost spirit; Rendition ($28.98; New Line), a well- intentioned drama about a conflicted CIA agent (the always empathetic Jake Gyllenhaal) upset over the torture of a US citizen handed over to our allies; In The Valley Of Elah ($27.98/$35.99 on Blu-Ray; Warner Bros.), another Iraq-linked drama with Tommy Lee Jones giving an Oscar nominated performance as a dad determined to learn the truth about his late son's tour of duty in that war-town country; Cops 20th Anniversary Edition ($29.98; Fox), a two-disc set on the reality series that will unquestionably celebrate a 40th anniversary and still be on the air; Margot at the Wedding ($29.99; Paramount), Noah Bambauch's acidic, unatisfying follow-up to The Squid and the Whale has fine acting from Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a too-familiar story of family squabbling; Don Rickles is celebrated in Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warmth ($26.99; HBO), a rare chance to see his comedy of insult in action; Madeline: Meet Me In Paris ($14.98; Fox), is an animated take on the schoolgirl and after umpteen attempts via TV, cartoons and yet another feature film in theworks, maybe they can admit it simply works best as a picture book and leave it at that; four AlainResnais films from the 80s come to DVD with modest extras, led by 1983's acclaimed bauble LifeIs A Bed Of Roses ($29.95; Kino); the Easter Bunny simply doesn't have the pull on the imagination that other holiday characters exert, as proven in two so-so TV specials, The EasterBunny Is Comin' To Town ($14.98; Warner Bros.), a Rankin-Bass stop-motion show narrated by Fred Astaire and It's The Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown ($19.98; Warner Bros.) with the even more desperate It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown special as a bonus; Chaos ($19.98; Lionsgate), a B movie bank heist but with Wesley Snipes, Ryan Phillippe and Jason Statham heading the cast, wouldn'tyou have loved to hang out on the set and heard their conversations?; and 1965's Pierrot Le Fou($39.95; Criterion), Jean Luc Godard's final stab at actually entertaining an audience via a madcaproad trip movie shot with Ã©lan if not a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So are you going to make the plunge into Blu-Ray?

(I buy my own CDs and rip them onto iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, If I get a differentplayer or my computer crashes or whatever, I still have a master copy of the album/movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More new movies are allowing you to download a free copy of the film which I think is def the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you buy a DVD, you should have access to a download copy that lets you watchit on your laptop or iPhone or other device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple's approach is great if you are pure Apple.But the record labels bitterly regret letting Apple get such dominance in online sales and themovie studios are NOT going t give them the same access to movies and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That'swhy they're library of movies is so weak and will be for a long time.

(Or mother test.) If your mother can tell thedifference between an audio cassette and a CD or a VHS tape and a DVD (and ofcourse she can), then it's a major leap forward I don't know anyone who hasn't been blown away and been made weak at the knees by hi-def programming on a hi-def TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regular TV shows don't always look dramatically better but sports and natureprogramming in hidef looks just stunning on a plasma or LCD sceen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically, stores have the best setup guaranteed to wow customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might indeed want to get your eyes checked :) And yes, new Blu-Ray players will typically play regular DVDs as well as Blu-Rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were some early incompatibility problems butthose have been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I mentioned above, there's a new wave of extras thatonly Blu-Ray players released in the fall will be able to accomodate (along withcurrent PlayStations) so if you're not eager, wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All leftcoastindy See Profile I'm a Fan of leftcoastindy permalink First DVD player - $650 ($900 today's dollars) First (1080P capable) Blu-ray player - $360To make viewing DVD's in widescreen format acceptable (picture more than 12" high) I had to purchase a 16/9 TV - $4000 ($5000 today) To make all my old DVD's look great on a Blu-Ray player so I don't have to replace my whole collection, I have to buy an HDMI connected TV - $1200 If you don't already have a surround sound system, you have no business reading this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Well, not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early DVD players were even more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But all electronics tend to drop as they go mainstream and until DVD players went below $300 it was considered a luxury,geeks-only product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BluRay players are more expensive than HD-DVD players but no one butearly adaptors buys them until they go below $300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The question is what do you get whenyou buy a player? With a CD player and my junky old stereo, the sound was light years aheadof audio cassettess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the same old TV I had, DVD players were stunningly better thanVHS tapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Blu-Ray on a standard TV, there's an improvement but it's marginal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That'sjust a technical fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must spend $1000+ (or much more) on a plasma or LCD screen to get the full wow effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hook up a BluRay to the fine TV I already own (which is not widescreen) and you don't see much difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what most people willexperience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VHS tape seems fine until you plug in a DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DVD player isgreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when you plug in a BluRay it's a little better but not remarkably so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everyonehas a home theater system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, 80% of households don't have a home theater system.And they want to know, if I buy just a BluRay player the way I bought a DVD player andbefore that a CD player, will I be thrilled? The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike CDs and DVDs, gettingthe benfit of BluRay is a LOT more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've got a perfectly good TV, a Bosespeaker system and hundreds (okay thousands) of DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm def going to get a plasmascreen maybe by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should I rush out and get BluRay before that?
