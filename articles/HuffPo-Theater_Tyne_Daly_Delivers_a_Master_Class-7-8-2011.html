Garrett Sorenson has the best voice for this genre and yet is the weakest actor, playing the outgoing Anthony Candolino as an eager puppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, Sorenson for all his lack of subtlety when acting has charisma and presence and a friendly chemistry with Daly that works marvelously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His scene is the only time we know exactly how talented he is and how Callas feels about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorenson's musical climax is alsothe moment that sends a genuine thrill through the audience so it was no surprise to discover in thePlaybill that he's a rising star in the opera world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The confusion returns with Sierra Boggess as Sharon Graham, a role knocked out of the park by Audra McDonald in the original production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boggess (who starred in The Little Mermaid ) doesn't convince as an opera singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when she and Callas come to blows, it's unclear what director Stephen Wadsworth'sintent might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It could be played many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Graham could be a genuine talent and thus Callas cuts herdown as a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or Graham could be talented but only of a certain sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She certainly wouldn't be thefirst to be told she wasn't right for a particular role like Lady Macbeth so Callas is simply being blunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thefireworks between the two just fizzle out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeremy Cohen has the fewest lines of the principals but creates a warm, distinct personality as the pianist Manny Weinstock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knows how to provide accompaniment both as a musician and an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Played broadly and musically uncertain, this Master Class doesn't do full justice to the quiet charms of McNally's play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Daly never puts a foot wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder she's a Tony winner and (I believe) the only person to win an Emmy for a leading role in three different TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When she's leaving the stage andalmost -- but not quite -- picks up an orange given to her as a sentimental gift, it's a brief but poignantmoment she captures easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Callas doesn't want our pity but she always commands our attention,especially when played by Daly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 out of **** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** One Arm *** MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW USSigns Your Husband Is GayKirstie Alley Walks NYFW The Alexander Wang PartyKnightley Gets Dangerous Like 115K Like 89 Like 64K Like 2K Like 453 Like 2K Like 111 Like 3K Like 1KMadonna, In Toronto, Denies Telling Volunteers Not...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anna Faris Talks Women Actresses, Co-Stars And...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michelle Williams' Marilyn Monroe Transformation For 'My...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Rudd In Playboy: Self- Loathing, Nudity And...Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark * 1/2 Unnatural Acts *** Zarkana ** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz was provided with free tickets to this show with the understanding that he would be writing a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Buy a link here Sponsored Links What is Scientology Think For Yourself and Find Out for Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientology.org #1 Snoring Solution New solution that allows medical insurance to pay for remedy. www.WhyYouNeedtoKnow.com College - 100% Online Be more employable!
