You get absolutely no points for predicting any of the plot twists or the gung-ho finale of this enjoyable B movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a by-the- numbers war movie and well served by not trying to be anything more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron Eckhart is the battle-scarred veteran who is ready to clock out after 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothing else, he's haunted by the memory of his last time in battle, when he lost all the men under his command, for which he received a medal and a lifetime of guilt and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But wouldn't you know it? Just as he's set to retire, a bunch of aliens decide to attack Earth, forcing Eckhart to join another group of soldiers including a green commander straight out of military school, a dorky virgin from down on the farm, a bad-ass woman(Michelle Rodriguez) and the bitter, suspicious brother of one of the men Eckhart lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their mission isto rescue some civilians trapped at a police station and get them away from the coastline before the AirForce gets all medieval on the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like a good drive-in movie, Battle: Los Angeles does a clever job of introducing world-wide attacks via TV news reports that make the story seem epic even if we stay close in on this one group of soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, for quite a while the aliens are glimpsed in brief flashes or lost in the shadows of some smoke to keep them both mysterious and less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was exactly in the right mood for this movie, which features some smart "John Wayne" action from our hero as he wins the grudging respect of his fellow soldiers.The finale is so fist-pumping and manly you'll be headed towards the nearest recruitment center beforeyou know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eckhart does a fine job as a square-jawed soldier, even when he's saddled with lines like"Marines don't cry" and a hoary call to arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fun stuff as long as you don't expect a whit more thanthey're going to give you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAS BOOT COLLECTOR'S SET ($35.99 BluRay; Sony) -- From pretty good B movie to a genuinely great film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Das Boot is a modern classic about Germans involved in submarine warfare during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a tense, thrilling film of combat and also deeply moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This BluRay contains the 2 1/2 hourfeature film version and the 3 1/2 hour director's cut, which includes more footage used in a Germanminiseries version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great to have the original theatrical cut here; you'll wince and shiver over everysingle ping and pop during the underwater games of cat and mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Wolfgang Petersen nevercame within a mile of this ever again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NENETTE/ANIMALS AND MORE ANIMALS ($39.95; Kino) -- I know documentary filmmaker Nicolas Philibert for his classroom masterpiece To Be And To Have, which is one of the warmest and MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

Maui, by the way, looks amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, I noticed the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOT IN THE DARK ($19.98; HBO) -- Actor Adrian Grenier's heartfelt exploration of fatherhood and his attempt to reconnect with his biological dad comes out just in time for Father's Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extras include updated interviews with the people involved done via Skype along with unreleased footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HAIR PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT NEW YORK, NEW YORK ($19.99 each; MGM) -- Three musicals come to BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hair always seemed like an artifact of its era but the recent Broadway revival has given it new life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you can't catch the show when it returns to New York City this summer, check out the DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Priscilla is also on Broadway as a new musical, which is no surprise since this heartwarming comic drama was practically amusical in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only Martin Scorsese's New York, New York has failed to make it to the Great White Way, but don't count it out yet -- it does have one of the greatest 11 O'clock numbers of them allwhen Liza Minelli belts out "New York, New York" at the end, the title song written specifically for thisfilm by Kander and Ebb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can you believe it wasn't even nominated for the Oscar? Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST GAY SHORTS VOL 1/BEST LESBIAN SHORTS VOL 1 ($24.95 each; First Run Features) -- Many minorities tell their stories via film shorts -- they're cheaper and easier to make on your own when the mainstream media refuses to represent you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even though LGBT storylines have taken root in TV, film, theater and books to a tremendous degree, their stories continue to be made into short films at ahigher rate than most other minorities and they certainly get seen in commercial movie houses moreoften.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not quite sure why this is so, but it seems true to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence these collections of shorts fromaround the world, seen at film festivals or on TV, ranging from the poem-like adaption of a DennisCooper work called simply "After" to the Twilight Zone -twists of "Steam" in Gay Shorts and a similar range in the lesbian shorts collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KORKORO ($29.95; Lorber Films) -- Dirctor Tony Gatlif avoids his usual formula of a Romany tale ending in an ecstatic musical eruption by delving into this period piece about the people then persecuted as Gypsies trying to avoid capture in Nazi-occupied France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A welcome change of pace for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HALL PASS ($28.98 regular or $35.99 BluRay; New Line) -- The Farrelly Brothers have become so passe their movies aren't even notable anymore as flops or successes.
