                <p>May 24, 2008Cannes Day Ten: New York, Teaching Kidsand Some Bad MagicSynecdoche, New York -- Oscar-winning screenwriter CharlieKaufman's directorial debut is a typically convoluted, highconcept tale about a theatrical director (Philip SeymourHoffman) whose wife (Catherine Keener) runs off to Berlin withtheir daughter and becomes a famous painter (while theirdaughter grows up off screen, gets a full body tattoo and startsdating Jennifer Jason Leigh).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoffman gets a MacArthur grantand heads to New York City where he finds a huge warehouseand builds a full-scale replica of the city and peoples it withactors playing himself and everyone in his life and directs themall, along with ultimately millions of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They rehearse thisplay for decades while outside the warehouse the world seemsto descend into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm always aware it's an artificialconstruct rather than getting caught up in the tale, thoughaffecting moments -- like Diane Weist speaking into Hoffman'sear via mike and directing him, Tom Noonan hovering overHoffman while studying Hoffman and so on -- can be found.Only for devoted fans, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The critic next to me wassurprised no one booed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally gets mixed notices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Class/Entre Les Murs -- After an amusing press conferencefor the documentary about the Chelsea Hotel by Abel Ferrara, Irealize that one of the last two films in Competition is playing atnoon and rush into a very crowded screening (it's playing thenext morning at 8:30 am and many people will be gone or, likeme, don't want to get up that early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directed by Laurent Cantet,it's based on a best-selling nonfiction novel by FrancoisBegaudeau, a teacher who documented one year at a tougher (iepoorer) Paris junior high school filled with kids from alldifferent races and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Begaudeau is also the star ofthe film, which takes place entirely in the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cantet is oneof the best and least heralded directors working today, withVisit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement CategoriesBingham Cup 2008BooksCannes 2008Cannes Film FestivalCelebsCoachellaComic-Con 2007Current AffairsFashionFilmAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-day-ten.html 1 of 47/22/09 4:13 PMseveral good to great films to his credit: Human Resources,Time Out, Heading South and now this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, "The Class" isprobably my favorite film in Competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subtle, funny andemotional, it's got a cast of kids equal to the kids who appearedin season four of HBO's "The Wire," which was also set in aschool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with Il Divo, I might not remember all their namesbut I know six or so of these kids (in a class of 24) very very welland the teacher most of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's clearly dedicated and smart,gently butting heads with another teacher who always wants toenforce the rules and sees the kids as the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisdescription is already blunter and less shaded then the filmitself, which has no villains or heroes (not even our teacher)and is always wiling to look deeper to empathize with all thecharacters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the teachers snap under the pressure oftrying to educate unruly kids who talk back and see no futureand therefore no reason to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see teacher meetings andparent-teacher conferences and disciplinary hearings but aboveall our teacher in his classroom with these kids, teaching themgrammar and writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His constant balancing act of trying tohear them out and let them express themselves naturallywithout losing control of the class is engrossing in and of itself.And the kids are so vidid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One smart girl with a wicked tonguealways challenges the teacher ("Why do you always use suchwhite names?" she said when he puts a sentence on the boardthat begins "Bill likes..." "Why not Ahmed?") (In a sign of howsubtle and real the film is, I really liked this girl while my friendStephen couldn't stand her and thought she was atroublemaker.) A cute gay kid who is always hanging out withthe other girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new kid Carl who was kicked out of anotherschool for misbehaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boubacar, who loves football/soccer,and can be cajoled into contributing after making a funnycomment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wei, a sweet, friendly Asian kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The girl who feelsthe professor has it in for her and says she's going to sit in theback and not speak to him for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AndSoulemane, a student who constantly gets into trouble withother teachers and who Francois really makes an effort toencourage -- praising a self-portrait done with photographs,dealing with his parents and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heartbreakingly, an offhandcomment in a teacher's meeting (where student representativesattend) gets back to Soulemane, which shames him and leads toa cascading series of events where everyone -- including theteacher -- makes tragic mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A film like this makes "DeadPoets Society" and "To Sir With Love" and "Blackboard Jungle"seem simplistic in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It deals with gender and classand intelligence and immigrants vs citizens in the most natural,unaffected way by simply looking carefully at these characters.Gripping, moving, and painfully real, it's surely the film to turnFilm FestivalsFood and DrinkIowa Caucus 2008LesbianMusicOutfest 2008PartiesPoliticsProvincetown Film Festival 2008Queen Mary 2 Historic CrossingReligionScienceSexSportsSydney Mardi Gras 2008Taylor Hanson for The AdvocateTelevisionThe DinahThe HRC Logo ForumThe L WordTheaterTravelRecent PostsMTV Video Music Awards...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheap, Or What?Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles: 30 Years YoungEric McCormack Auctions Off Porsche for ProjectAngel FoodWhat is the Advocate Insider?
