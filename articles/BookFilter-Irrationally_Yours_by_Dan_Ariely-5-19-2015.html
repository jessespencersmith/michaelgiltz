(Can't decide which of two cars to buy? Flipa coin! Then he explains why.) If you've got a pulse, you'll surely disagree with some of the advice Arielyoffers...and I'm sure there's a psychological term for this that Ariely will illuminate the next time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theamusing cartoons by New Yorker regular William Haefeli aren't just a welcome added bonus; they wittily add tothe conversation with their own wry perspective. -- Michael GiltzWhat Others Say“The human brain is one of the largest mysteries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trying to understand its complexities and improve ourbehavior is one of the main challenges society deals with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Irrationally Yours, Dan shares with us some of thesemysteries and the tools for accomplishing this task.” - Anthony “Tony” Robbins, #1 New York Times bestsellingauthor of Unlimited Power, Unleash the Power Within and Awaken the Giant Within“With 70% of his body burned, 3 years in hospital, and decades of experiments in social science, Dan views life froma unique perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this thoroughly entertaining book Dan provides insightful advice to a vast range of humanproblems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved it.” - Terry Jones, Monty Python member, director, actor and writer“Ariely is a master observer of human foibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His advice is funny, thoughtful, and well-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes all threetogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My advice: read it, enjoy it, think about it.” - Al Roth, Nobel Laureate in Economics and Craig andSusan McCaw Professor of Economics at Stanford University“Dan is the most provocative, interesting, and to-the-point advice columnist you…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
