I wrote a rave when he delivered his biography of Kit Carson and the West with "Bloodand Thunder." Now he's delivered another winner, this time about an ill-fated expedition to the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sidesdoes his most detailed and nuanced reporting here, capturing all sides of this tale, from the centuries-long delusionsabout a balmy ocean at the top of the world that led to disastrous planning to the colorful newspaper magnate JamesGordon Bennett who made it happen with the hope of advancing science...and selling lots of papers. (He's worthy ofa biopic of his own; Bennett sent Stanley after Livingston and intro'd tennis to America among many other stunts.) Atthe center of it all is the dutiful and determined military man George Washington De Long who becomes enamoredwith reaching the North Pole despite hating being away from his bride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her never-delivered love letters to him are apoignant counterpoint to his journey, filled as it is with fascinating shipboard characters (including one man who hideshis bout with syphilis, another who's a genius at repair and yet another who becomes bitterly estranged fromeveryone), narrow escapes, tragedy and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is so dramatic, Sides can play it cool here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He weavestogether the many strands of this narrative with a new maturity that gives this bid for glory its full due. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“As our knowledge of the world increases, it must be difficult for audacious explorers to find terra incognita to matchtheir passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely the same frustration holds true for writers in that worthy genre, exploration literature: Haven’t allgreat stories been told? Never underestimate the ingenuity of a first-rate author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hampton Sides’s In the Kingdom ofIce: The Grand and Terrible Polar Voyage of the USS Jeannette, which recounts the astonishing tribulations of agroup of seafarers determined to be the first men to reach and reconnoiter the North Pole, is a splendid book inevery way… It would be malicious to ruin the suspense about the fate of the Jeannette’s crew… The book is amarvelous nonfiction thriller.”- The Wall Street Journal"Compelling....Sides spins a propulsive narrative from obscure documents, journals and his own firsthand visits tothe Arctic regions visited by the Jeannette and its crew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Kingdom of Ice makes for harrowing reading as itrecounts the grim aspects of the explorers' battle for survival: illness, crippling frostbite, snow-blindness and theprospect…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
