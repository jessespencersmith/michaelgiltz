                <p>Newer Post Older PostTUESDAY, MARCH 27, 2012 IRAs 2012: "The Tree Of Life," "A Separation," "Hugo" and "Tinker Tailor" Top Winner s THE 37TH ANNUAL IRA FILM AWARDS The IRA Film Awards are the most prestigious, mysterious and exclusive movie awards in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long after the frenzy of "awards season" has passed, the members of the IRAs meet to soberly discuss, debate, argue, bicker, fight, and mock each other as they decide what truly are the best films, performances and technical achievements of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also shine a light on some of the worst achievements in cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs were founded in the 1970s with one very simple thought: we've got better taste than those other award shows; let's do our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And thus the IRAs were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its ranks have contained future Oscar winners, acclaimed and best-selling authors of both fiction and nonfiction (especially movie history), power players in the studio system, influential members of the media, hardcore cineastes and the team behind Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards, the most acclaimed (really, the ONLY acclaimed) awards book in history and the template for all the ones that followed in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually composed of 10-20 members, the IRAs spend their year watching and debating the movies that really matter, the ones they hope will last and then share their judgment with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "kids" -- younger members who joined in the 90s and the noughts - - have brought a new-found appreciation for animation and genres like sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The veterans remain loyal to stalwarts like Alain Resnais and the late, lamented Blake Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year's gathering was especially lavish and bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IRA member Joe generously hosted the event at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut over the March 23-25 weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why was it so lavish? To accommodate a second day of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Saturday, we determined the best films released commercially in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on Friday night, we established the final ranking of our top films of all time, the culmination of a process that involved a good six months of bickering and voting and watching and re-watching a bunch of classic films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why was it so bittersweet? Because weeks before the event founding IRA member Damien Bona -- the co-author of I nside Oscar -- died after a short and unexpected illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His scathing wit and love of movies was sorely missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four films dominated every single award (including the new edition of Best Editing), so you'll find it easy to check out the taste of the IRAs this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But after the winners, we'll show the entire winning ballots so you can see the range of films that were favored by at least some factions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover 22 movies well worth your time, for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to some of us. (Others may vehemently disagree.) After that, you'll find a list of all the award winners in IRA history from 1975 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So without further ado, this year's top winners are... 2011 IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS Best Picture: The Tree Of Life Best Director: Terrence Malick - The Tree Of Life Best Actor: Peyman Moadi - A Separation Best Actress: Leila Hatami - A Separation Best Supporting Actor: Hunter McCracken - The Tree Of Life Best Supporting Actress: Sareh Bayet - A Separation Best Screenplay: Ashgar Farhadi - A Separation Best Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki - The Tree Of Life Best Production Design: Dante Ferretti - Hugo Best Score: Alberto Iglesias - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Skin I Live In Best Editing: Hank Corwin, Jay Rabinowitz, Daniel Rezende, Billy Weber, Mark Yoshikawa - The Tree Of Life Best Costumes: Jacqueline Durran - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Sominex Award (The Movie That Put Us To Sleep): Midnight In Paris Dramamine Award (The Movie That Made Us Sick): The Help Mechanical Actress: Meryl Streep - The Iron Lady Mechanical Actor: Owen Wilson - Midnight In Paris FILMS CITED BY THE IRAS FOR 2011 IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER Another Earth (1 mention) The Artist (1 mention) Cave Of Forgotten Dreams (1 mention) A Dangerous Method (6 mentions) The Descendants (1 mention) Drive (1 mention) The Help (1 mention) Hugo (8 mention) In Darkness (3 mentions) Jane Eyre (1 mention) Margin Call (2 mentions) Meek's Cutoff (2 mentions) Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (1 mention) Moneyball (2 mentions) My Week With Marilyn (1 mention) Pina (1 mention) A Separation (7 mentions) Shame (1 mention) Take Shelter (3 mentions) Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (9 mentions) The Tree Of Life (11 mentions) Win Win (2 mentions) FILMS CITED BY THE IRAS FOR 2011 IN ORDER OF MENTIONS (HOW MANY TIMES THEY APPEARED ON A FINAL LIST OF WINNERS -- NOT INCLUDING THE "NEGATIVE AWARDS") The Tree Of Life (11 mentions) Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (9 mentions) Hugo (8 mention) A Separation (7 mentions) A Dangerous Method (6 mentions) In Darkness (3 mentions) Take Shelter (3 mentions) Margin Call (2 mentions) Meek's Cutoff (2 mentions) Moneyball (2 mentions) Win Win (2 mentions) Another Earth (1 mention) The Artist (1 mention) Cave Of Forgotten Dreams (1 mention) The Descendants (1 mention) Drive (1 mention) The Help (1 mention) Jane Eyre (1 mention) Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol (1 mention) My Week With Marilyn (1 mention) Pina (1 mention) Shame (1 mention) THE COMPLETE BALLOTS IN ORDER OF VOTING BEST COSTUMES 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jacqueline Durran - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 35 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jacqueline West - The Tree Of Life 29 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandy Powell - Hugo 27 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Victoria Farrell - Meek's Cutoff 13 pts. (tie) Denise Cronenberg - A Dangerous Method (tie) BEST EDITING 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hank Corwin, Jay Rabinowitz, Daniel Rezende, Billy Weber, Mark Yoshikawa - The Tree Of Life 28 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thelma Schoonmaker - Hugo 22 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dino Jonsater - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Hirsch - Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toni Froschhammer - Pina 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After many years of consideration, the IRAs have finally added an award for editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some argued for excluding it because they felt editing was too difficult to judge without knowing what material an editor had to work with and how involved the director was in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But obviously this is true of virtually every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, still others felt that documentary films are invariably "found" in the editing room so they would dominate this award; why not just add Best Documentary? But still others said if a documentary is the best film of the year, it should win as the best film of the year and not be placed in a ghetto. (In fact, documentaries have won the top award, including Eyes On The Prize in 1986 and arguably Decasia in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year the winner was for "most editing," with the five person team dealing with the endless footage generated by Malick being recognized for their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST MUSIC 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alberto Iglesias - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Skin I Live In 33 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Howard Shore - Hugo and A Dangerous Method. 23 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ernst Reijseger - Cave Of Forgotten Dreams 15 pts (tie) David Wingo - Take Shelter 15 pts (tie) 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexandre Desplat - The Tree Of Life 14 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, it's already clear that three films will be dominant players in tonight's voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Widespread approval of Iglesias's work on Tinker made him a popular front-runner from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dante Ferretti - Hugo 37 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jack Fisk - The Tree Of Life 35 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maria Djurkovic - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 29 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laurence Bennett - The Artist 20 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James McAteer - A Dangerous Method 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a squeaker, Hugo beats out The Tree Of Life for Production Design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would turn out to be Hugo's only win but put the fear of God in Malick supporters (who were mostly anti- Hugo as well, with one notable exception).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serious politicking began in the two camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Snagging Production Design may have been the warning sign that brought together its passionate detractors and kept Hugo out of the winner's circle for the rest of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmanuel Lubezki - The Tree Of Life 38 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoyte Van Hoytema - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 19 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Richardson - Hugo 18 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guillaume Schiffman - The Artist 13 pts. (tie) Jolanta Dylewska - In Darkness 13 pts. (tie) With the night's highest point total and largest margin of victory, it's clear that IRA's voters agree on one thing: The Tree Of Life looks spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCREENPLAY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ashgar Farhadi - A Separation 37 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bridget O'Connor &amp; Peter Straughan - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 31 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrence Malick - The Tree Of Life 14 pts. (tie) John Logan - Hugo 14 pts. (tie) 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chandor - Margin Call 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, A Separation makes its first appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Humanist dramas are often overlooked in tech categories and the Iranian winner of the Best Foreign Film Oscar is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least when it comes to the IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margin Call got a deserved nod for its screenplay, which captured the complexity of the financial meltdown in a fictional tale of disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sareh Bayat - A Separation 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jessica Chastain - The Tree Of Life, Take Shelter, The Help 24 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shailene Woodley - The Descendants 17 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarina Farhadi - A Separation 12 pts. (tie) Amy Ryan - Win Win 12 pts (tie) In many other award groups, it was the cast of The Help that dominated the supporting actress awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the IRAs, it was the supporting cast of A Separation , clearly one of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some supported the care-giver, others supported the daughter and still others argued that the wife was the supporting role and that the caregiver should have been up for best actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One key pleasure of the IRAs is to correct the "mistakes" of the Oscars, which sometimes put people in the wrong categories because of politicking by the studios or due to star power instead of what makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it ain't east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just check out the Supporting Actor category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter McCracken - The Tree Of Life 29 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Albert Brooks - Drive 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vincent Cassell - A Dangerous Method 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Shaffer - Win Win 9 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kevin Spacey - Margin Call 7 pts (tie) Jonah Hill - Moneyball 7 pts. (tie) See what I mean? I'd argue that Hunter McCracken's character in The Tree Of Life is the lead role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the heart of the film and it's told from his point of view and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't put a stopwatch to the film, but since Young Jack has countless scenes with his father and more with his mother and then goes off to play with friends, it's inconceivable to me that anyone could think the supporting role of Brad Pitt as his father Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Brien would be anything but what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Oscars saw it differently because Pitt is a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in fact, the Ira votes also felt McCracken's character was not the lead, split as it was between him and Sean Penn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We certainly aren't waiting for Pitt to show up for the awards ceremony so the Ira voters must be sincere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the least, this award inspired one of the night's funnier lines: "Release the McCracken!" BEST ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leila Hatami - A Separation 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keira Knightley - A Dangerous Method 22 pts 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michelle Williams - Meek's Cutoff, My Week With Marilyn 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britt Marling - Another Earth 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viola Davis - The Help 10 pts. (tie) Chloe Grace Moretz - Hugo 10 pts. (tie) A Separation continued to dominate the acting awards and inspired thoughts that it might upend the support for The Tree Of Life, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Hugo to snag the night's biggest awards. it helped that several Ira voters went to see the film for the first time (and some for the second or third) the afternoon of the voting, so it was also fresh in everyone's minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also helped Hatami that besides being a very talented actress she is luminously beautiful and inspired some to compare her to Ingrid Bergman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peyman Moadi - A Separation 33 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gary Oldman - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy - 30 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brad Pitt - Moneyball, The Tree Of Life 28 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Fassbender - A Dangerous Method, Jane Eyre, Shame 13 pts. (tie) Michael Shannon - Take Shelter 13 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The momentum keeps building for A Separation with its lead actor winning the top prize among the men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Tree, Separation and Hugo still jockeying for supremacy, Tinker Tailor seemed to fade in the home stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it was going to win any major award, it should have been for Gary Oldman's performance, one of the most subtle and effective in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, it was good to see Michael Shannon get recognition for his terrific work in the vivid indie Take Shelter, a favorite of many Ira voters, even if it didn't break into the top 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the very high point totals for the top three actors, it's clear they were all deeply admired by the vast majority of Ira voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DIRECTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrence Malick - The Tree Of Life 32 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Scorsese - Hugo 27 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tomas Alfredson - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 23 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ashgar Faradi - A Separation 23 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agnieszka Holland - In Darkness 12 pts. it wasn't a nail-biter, but Malick's triumph in the Best Director category wasn't a walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Scorsese and Alfredson scored in the 20s, very respectable showings. (Scorsese's long career gave him the edge over Alfredson, who has deeply impressed with Tinker and his debut Let The Right One In; he's definitely made the most of his opportunity.) The Holocaust film hadn't broken through in many categories but put in a strong showing here and in Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PICTURE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tree Of Life 32 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Separation 26 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugo 24 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 19 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Darkness 12 pts. (tie) Cave Of Forgotten Dreams 12 pts. (tie) Thirty three years after winning the IRA award for Best Picture with Days Of Heaven , director Terrence Malick triumphed again with The Tree Of Life, beating off upstarts like the terrific Iranian drama A Separation (which dominated the acting awards), Martin Scorsese's Hugo (a controversial film with as many detractors as supporters at the Iras) and the generally admired Tinker , whose supporters were just as quiet and reserved as the film itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Darkness and Cave Of Forgotten Dreams also made showings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cave was the most popular documentary of the year at the Iras, though Pina and several others had strong support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's likely that the voting for Cave and In Darkness drained some points from A Separation and kept it from competing for an upset win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMINEX AWARD (THE MOVIE THAT PUT US TO SLEEP) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Midnight In Paris 28 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginners 10 pts. (tie) Hugo 10 pts. (tie) Moneyball 10 pts. (tie) 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three Backyards 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This award is for the film that put us to sleep this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's often a chance for some spoilsports to make their displeasure over certain films known (hence the voting for Hugo, which scored highly on most Ira ballots).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some voters hated Woody Allen's latest, while others were bemused by its massive popularity (just as Woody himself says he can never guess which film of his will click with audiences).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But everyone agreed Midnight In Paris is not one of Woody's finest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRAMAMINE AWARD (THE MOVIE THAT MADE US SICK) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Help 22 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arthur 12 pts. (tie) The Iron Lady (tie) 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buried Prayers 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah's Key 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half the fun of the Iras is talking about movies you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other half? Making fun of the movies you hate and the taste of other Ira voters and mainstream critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Help was not exactly polarizing -- most Ira voters disliked it immensely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a few held the acting in the film in high regard, which is why Viola Davis made it onto the Best Actress ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the critical acclaim combined with Hollywood's invariable gambit of telling the story of black characters by focusing on a white character proved catnip to Ira voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buried Prayers and Sarah's Key are two Holocaust-themed films that certain voters found noxious in their politics and storytelling, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liberals many of the Ira members may be, but liberal piety won't get you far with them (and certainly not in the movies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MECHANICAL ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meryl Streep - The Iron Lady 22 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie Portman - Thor 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frida Pinto - Miral 10 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berenice Bejo - The Artist 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bryce Dallas Howard - The Help 6 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Mechanical acting awards aren't for stiffness as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's more about calling out actors for reverting to a set of tics we've seen many times before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the case of Streep (a brilliant stage actress), the award seemed to be as much for the film's soft-pedaling of a major figure who is far more controversial and transfixing than this fuzzy around the edges biopic made clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MECHANICAL ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Owen Wilson - Midnight In Paris 23 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shia LaBeouf - Transformers: Dark Of The Moon 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Franco - Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christopher Plummer - Beginners 7 pts. (tie) Keifer Sutherland - Melancholia 7 pts (tie) Here's a great example of a Mechanical Acting award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I didn't vote for Owen Wilson because I actually thought he was fine and a pretty good substitute Woody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many others felt he was coasting on his usual surfer dude schtick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shia was pegged for Transformers , perhaps an irresistible target given the mechanical nature of the battling Autobots and their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COMPLETE IRA MOVIE AWARD WINNERS 1975 IRA Film Award Winners Best Picture: Barry
