The subject was the Louvre itself:Morse would capture a great hall of the famed museum and include 38 of his favorites works, includingDa Vinci's Mona Lisa .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morse's great friend, the writer James Fennimore Cooper, could barely keep himself away and returned day after day to chart the painter's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This style of painting -- one piece containing many smaller but bravura works or portraits within it -- is exactly the model for author and historian David McCullough's new book The Greater Journey: Americans In Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCullough looks at the many artists, scientists, people of medicine and thinkers who made the voyage back across the Atlantic to find inspiration and knowledge in the City of Lightsfrom roughly 1830 to the end of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Paris of the 1920s -- when Hemingway and F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Fitzgerald romanticized the life of the expat -- seems almost a backwater when compared to the flood of people that came there during these sixdecades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. relished his medical studies in Paris while McCullough deftly displays both how Paris was the center of medical knowledge at that time and how the Americanswho studied there would revolutionize care when they returned to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Painter Mary Cassatt wasn't exactly embraced by Paris; women had a tough row to hoe there as much as they would in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Cassatt found admirers of her work (not, sadly, including her The Twitter Typo That Exposed Weiner Engadget: WWDC 2011 liveblog: Steve Jobs talks iOS 5, OS X Lion, iCloud and more!
