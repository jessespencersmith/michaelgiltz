                <p>arts&amp;eatertaiDmeat tile a. t e r Heart I s Larry Kramer's classic AIDS play The Normal Heart, revived in New York 20 years to the day after its opening, still cuts deep, A talk with leading men Raul Esparza and Billy Warlock By Michael Giltz s The ·orm at HeaTt-Larry Kra­ mer's dramal;pp ~d from the h ad­ lines (or, mol' accurately ripped from what should hav be n the headHnes)-dated? AU greaT plays are universal, but is The Normal Heart now a period piece? We'll have to wait another 50 or 100 years before that question can be an­ swered because the current revival at the Public Theater in New York City-opening on April 21, 20 years to the day and in the very same space where it debuted-makes abundantl y clear that The Normal HeaTt is still painful­ ly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The AIDS crisis growing ever more deadly? A complacent public and a downright antagonistic government? Gay marriage and a passionate debate over whether gay identity is wrapped up in sex or something more? Younger THE ADVOCATE I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I MAY 25. 2004 theatergoers might be forgiven for thinking Kramer wrote this play today, except for one thing: Its passion is still singular and rare. "When I read it, it made me very angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It still has that visceral wallop," says Raul Esparza, who plays Kra­ mer's stand-in, Ned Weeks, and who has also shone in such Broadway shows as Taboo, Cabaret, and Tick, Tick ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boom! I I , I I I I I "When we did the first reading in this space I couldn't stop cry­ ing," says Esparza. "It gives you chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are so many things the audience will pick up that the characters don't realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is heavy with dramatic irony right now, every time you mention gay marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He keeps saying, 'Why didn't you fight for this?'" For Billy Warlock-of Bay­ watch and General Hospital fame-the role of Ned's lover, Felix, is a chance to fight for broader opportunities as an actor. "I'm a really simple guy," says Warlock, who walked away from General Hospital without any roles locked in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eighteen days later he read for this play, left for New York, got an apartment, and started to prepare for his New York theatrical debut. "This play takes up every bit of focus I have," Warlock says. "It really does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I really stop and think about what we're getting ready to do, it's an over­ whelming thing for a guy that's used to film and TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a whole other animal." Warlock is perhaps an instinc­ tual actor, while Esparza is a very verbal and intellectual one. (He's so well-versed on gay is­ sues that Esparza deserves to be an honorary homo, though he has been married to a woman since 1994.) But both he and Warlock describe Kramer as an intimidating presence. "He's intense," laughs Warlock. "When he looks and talks to you .. .it's weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the last guy I would ever want to piss off. n Esparza agrees. "He's a very difficult man," says Esparza admiringly. "He pushes you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've really fallen for him, I have to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His integrity is extraor­ dinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think anybody could live that burningly honest all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been asked by great people that I ad­ mire, 'How many men do you know that have changed the world?' And he's one of them." • For David Drake's commentary about Tfle Normal Hearl, tum to page 68.</p>
