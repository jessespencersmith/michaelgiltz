The theme tonight again was the '70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sure would benice to get a peek at the list of songs the contestants get to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's such a boringrepetition of artists and songs that I'd like to know whether to blame the singers or the producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly Smithson -- another so-so performance from Smithson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an earlier season, maybe she would have been dubbed as having that magical "studio" voice, which usually meant her appealwasn't singing live but she had something to offer on recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly sang the Heart song "Crazyon You," the band's very first hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she insisted, "I always wanted to perform it on AmericanIdol." Really, he said cattily? Even when you were 15 and signed to a major label and watching them spend millions on your first album? Surely you were dreaming of Madison Square Garden or Radio City and not a TV talent contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like that she proudly displayer her ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I still find her voice thin and sharp in the upper register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OK, but the judges insist she's the gal to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha Mercado -- My biggest crush, Syesha 'fessed up about her pro past, which doesn't amountto more than regional TV commercials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her imitationof a baby crying was really good but an awful sequeinto her mellow rendition of the Billy Paul hit "Meand Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones." Simon said it was bizarre to change the gender of the song (she naturally sang "Me and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones") but that's a ridiculous comment.Gender changes on songs are done literally every day and there's nothing lyrically that stamps thissong as inappropriate or strange for a woman to sing to a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looked just terrific with avaguely period '70s scarf that wasn't too retro so she looked like she was playing dress-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(By the way, Linda Ronstadt is ridiculously under-appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you love Americana, checkout The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Best Of The Capitol Years , which contains four complete albums including one of her masterpieces Heart Like A Wheel all at a bargain price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of my absolute favorite albums.) Amanda Overmyer -- the night's first and worst trainwreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glimpses of Amanda before the break showed she had gone crazy with the hair, looking like Bonnie Raitt's mad sister or a Halloween costume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really, her streaks absolutely took over and looked terrible with those jeans.She sang the Kansas breakthrough hit "Carry On Wayward Son" and it was just awful, with hervoice bottoming out right at the start to a cringe-worthy degree and then it got worse, withAmanda trying to regain control but losing the melody, yelping louder and louder -- screaming,really -- and then for a brief moment I thought she might at least end on a decent note but she wavered from a strong moment and tried to riff, ruining even the chance of a single decently sung line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I expected the judges to suggest it might be over for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, they treated her with extreme kid gloves, with Randy ignoring the actual singing and telling her to focus on blues-y stuff and Paula insisting against all evidence that she was "a brilliant, brilliant artist." Even Simon didn't drop the hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've rarely been so surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't care that she has the rock tip cornered among the gals, I think it's the end for Amanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alaina Whitaker -- sang the Olivia Newton-John smash "Hopeless Devoted To You" and did the only thing more dangerous than a disaster like poor Amanda's performance -- be forgettable.Forgettable is the worst thing you can do because an awful performance can elicit sympathy (shewas better last week!) while a forgettable performance just...fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballads really expose yourweaknesses as a singer and Alaina has a lot, I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, the judges are bizarrely nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexandrea Lushington -- sang Chicago's "If You Leave Me Now," their first Number One hit after 18 Top 40 singles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had a rough low beginning and fiddled so much with the arrangement by the end I didn't even recognize the song and suspected she was working in a medley. (Is thatallowed? I doubt it.) It ended with a very weak attempt at a soulful vamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again, the judgesremained inexplicably friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have they forgotten their job? Randy insisted the song was a "safe"choice but didn't mention that she sang the safe choice poorly which should be even a bigger sin,right? Simon made one very good point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the song was of its era, but really it gets down tothe tune being a great record but not a great standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is, they delivered a great tune but youdon't want to hear other people record versions of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year at the Grammys people ask thedifference between Record of the Year and Song of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Record f the Year is a great tune butnot one you expect a lot of people to cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think of Peter Gabriel's "Sledgehammer."

Song of the Year? Think "River" by Joni Mitchell which has become a Christmas standard and deservedly so. "If You Leave Me Now" is a very good record but not a good song and thus not a good choice for delivering a cover on Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexandrea was rescued a bit by a sweet interview with Ryan after her singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kady Malloy -- another Heart song, this time "Magic Man." It really does seem tiresome how the same songs get chosen over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had a cool dress and a great ring and was unmemorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the Carly Smithson Heart cover seems better by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asia'h Epperson -- the final performance is Eric Carmen's hypermelodramatic "All By Myself" and it's another trainwreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asia'h is in major trouble after just a few words but covers her stumble with a gentle little laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe she'll be okay? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When she staggers into the first chorus her voice drops out completely and she's practically whispering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrible beginning, terrible middle and a screechy ending Ryan made a point of emphasizing Asia'h is very under the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would explain Randy and Paula being gentle but it doesn't explain their praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her voice completely dropped out during the first chorus for heaven's sake and no one even mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely just as bad as forgetting lines is being incapable of actually singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm completely confused by the judges tonight. (Though Simon brought a little reality by saying simply the song was too big for her and she made a mistake choosing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll say.) So many weak performances at the end, it's hard to know who will go home first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I believe Brooke White, Carly Smithson and (please) Syesha Mercado are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have to assume Amanda Overmyeris going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I balance out the worst performance of the evening with the most boring, thenshe'll be joined by Alaina Whitaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presumably people will give Asia'h a pass because she was ill.So who did you like and who do you expect to go home?

Hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find him as phoney as a two dollar bill in his "aw shucks" cuteness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gives me a raging tooth ache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad teens are so fast at text voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're stuck with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Idol David ArchuletaPaula AbdulPop MusicRandy JacksonReality TVRyan SeacrestSimon Cowell Style : Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Style : Verena von Pfetten 7 Lessons To Be Learned From Carla Bruni Style : Verena von Pfetten Brow-O-Wow: Bushy Eyebrows Make AComeback (PHOTOS, POLL) Related Tags Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:49 PM on 02/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:09 PM on 02/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:09 PM on 02/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:03 PM on 02/28/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:17 PM on 02/28/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 20: The Women http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_88850.html [4/5/2009 7:40:16 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!
