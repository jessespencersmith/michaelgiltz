                <p>S U N D A Y , J A N U A R Y 3 0 , 2 0 0 5Democracy is Born In The Middle Eastby Michael in New York on 1/30/2005 09:02:00 PMI did not support Bush's unilateral invasion of Iraq (but Ithought the UN should have gone in there YEARS ago).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butwhatever you think of the war, anyone with a heart has to beinspired by seeing people flocking to the polls in Iraq,apparently at the same level as voters here in the US -- andwhen they are risking their lives to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is inspiring to seewomen proudly displaying their ink-stained fingers that indicatethey too were able to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even some Sunni areas saw strongnumbers of voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the dominant Shiites and Kurds canactually maintain a pluralistic, secular government -- ratherthan taking revenge on the Sunnis who dominated them forages -- it will be a miracle of decency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arab news channels --according to the NYT -- were filled with images of the historicvote going out to the entire Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our "allies" --strategic partners who share none of our values, like Egypt andSaudi Arabia -- are deeply, deeply disturbed by this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good.Yes, the country is still riven by violence and 1/5th of thepopulation is deeply hostile to the new leaders and ourpresence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, the infrastructure is a mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, Afghanistanhad elections and now only a few major cities are controlled bythe "good guys" while a third of the country is back under theheels of the Taliban and another third dominated by drug lords.But people want to be free -- whether they live in China orNorth Korea or Iran or Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People want to be free -- despitea thousand year history of sectarian hatred and religiousfanaticism, Iraqis risked their lives to go to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We shouldbe happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And God willing today may be the day they start toconsider themselves Iraqis instead of Kurds or Sunni or Shiite.I almost put a question mark at the end of the headline --Democracy is Born in the Middle East? But I don't think there'sany question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diplomacy.Norwich.EduAds by Goooooogle Add New CommentYou are commenting as a Guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may select one to log into: Logged in as HuffPost PoliticsPaul Helmke: NRA Defeated In Key Gun ViolencePrevention Vote: Elections Have Consequences -The National Rifle Association leadership suffered amajor defeat in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Senate today, losing a keyvote on a bill that would have radically...5 minutes ago Daily KosWaterloo, But for Who?
