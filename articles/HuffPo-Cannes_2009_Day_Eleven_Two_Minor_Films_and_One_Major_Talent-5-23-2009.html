What they actually began showing was Montparnasse , a film I had heard literally nothing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C'est la vie, no? I settled in, imaging, nay, hoping that this might be fate and I wasabout to watch a wonderful movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just one hour in length, it contained three vignettes seemingly unrelated -- two sisters talk about the fears and instabilities one of them suffers from, a nice guy has dinner with the father of a friend they'll soon be picking up at the train station, and a young single mother invites the burly but sweet singer of a band she's watched perform to come back to her apartment for a drink.They're all of minor interest but when you combine them together they seem even less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I rushed outside, found a schedule of screenings posted on a pillar (why didn't they distribute them last night to our mailboxes?) and found out La Pivellina was playing next at 3:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Voila! I getin line, go back and take the same aisle seat I was in a moment ago and wait for the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It received one of four awards handed out at the Directors Fortnight (while three were won by one of my favorites, I Killed My Mother ), so I settled back, imagining -- no, believing I was about to see a wonderful movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uh, I don't speak French and the movie had no English subtitles. (I am a little pleased that it took five minutes for me to realize this because the opening scene was so simple (a gypsy-looking Pals: Mischa Barton Struggled with Body Issues READ MORE Hailey Glassman Gushes over Jon Gosselin READ MORE Demi Lovato and Trace Cyrus Split READ MORE More Celebrity News at People.com Popular Stories on HuffPost Nude In NY: Where To Strut With No Stuff (NSFW PHOTOS, POLL) Believe it or not getting nude in NY isn't such a hard feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I go outside and ask the numerous guards and ushers if they know theEnglish subtitling is off and they shrug their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I give up and head to the DirectorsFortnight press office and explain the situation, trying to find out if the next two movies would or would not have English subtitling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She responded brightly that yes, of course La Pivellina naturally would have English subtitling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I explain I just came from the screening and in fact it did NOT haveEnglish subtitling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's puzzled but brightly assures me that the next two movies indeed would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not filled with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway, it's off to the Majestic Beach where I interview, Xavier Dolan, the handsome talented 20 year old writer-director-star of I Killed My Mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He apologizes several times about his English not being so perfect even though I don't speak a word of French and make clear his solid English is far superior to my pidgin French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We only have 20 minutes but it's the sort of casual but serious interview that used to be a staple of Cannes for the press and all the directors and stars of the major films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, the number of media is so massive that except in rare cases all you get is a press conference quote (where you can ask one question)and maybe a round table with six or seven other journalists (where you get to ask two or maybeeven three).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only with new, rising talent like Dolan can you actually sit down and talk at length, with the surf in the background and the festival buzzing all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I reluctantly take leave of Dolan and head to the only other screening I can make for the day, a well-reviewed movie called The King Of Escapes .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a good movie but it's certainly wacky as it describes the life of a burly, bearish middle-aged guy who cruises for men with his good friend and then rescues a 16 year old girl from rapists and unexpectedly finds himself attracted to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sheis most definitely attracted to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sexual fluidity doesn't even begin to describe the goings-on here, with older straight men taking a new drug and then going out into the woods to masturbate with each other, our gay hero having oodles of sex with his Lolita, and a reserved police chief whowalks in at the most unexpected moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a certain loosey goosey appeal and I really enjoyed the end of the fest crowd I saw it with -- the blue-haired ladies who snagged a ticket gasped with delighted shock as the men went at it with elan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A truly horrible score and weakvisuals (though I won't soon forget our hefty hero running through the woods in his underwear)contribute to the over-all shabby air of a movie that does at least keep you off balance and ends well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AWARDS PICKS Sunday, the top awards will be handed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a fool's errand to try and pick what will win because you're not talking about the consensus of the critics, you're talking about the reactions of the jury and the deals and counter-deals they make with each other in order to honor the moviesthey felt passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So these are NOT my predictions for the winners; these are the awardsI'd give out if I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL'S PALME D'OR: Un Prophete (this is also the critical favorite of all the movies in Competition) MICHAEL'S GRAND JURY PRIZE (RUNNER-UP) -- The Time That Remains MICHAEL'S BEST ACTOR -- Christoph Waltz of Inglourius Basterds (though I'll be very happy if Tahar Rahim of Un Prophete gets it) MICHAEL'S BEST ACTRESS -- Katie Jarvis for Red Road though Charlotte Gainsbourg for Anti-Christ makes sense too Now this is where it gets tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unspoken rule after the Coen Brothers swept is to limit any film to two major awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the trade-offs become very apparent here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL'S BEST DIRECTOR -- Andrea Arnold for Fish Tank MICHAEL'S BEST SCREENPLAY -- Elia Suleiman for The Time That Remains MICHAEL'S CAMERA D'OR -- Perhaps the most combative category, with three very good movies battling it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My guess is Samson &amp; Delilah will triumph, but it could also be I Killed My Mother or Dogtooth and everyone would be happy. ( Dogtooth just won Un Certain Regard so that might kill its chances at this award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL'S JURY PRIZE -- these are just random awards to make sure a notable achievement doesn't fall through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd say The Best Rewriting Of History to Quentin Tarantino forInglourius Basterds and Best Performance By An Athlete to Eric Cantona for Looking For Eric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I haven't even mentioned Police, Adjective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the runner-up for the Un Certain Regard prize and may well be the best reviewed film of the festival in any category (Competition, DirectorsFortnight, etc.) It will certainly be on my best of the year list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm seeing four movies on Sunday They Played Presidents: Who Was Believable?
