                <p>Newer Post Older PostSATURDAY, MAY 02, 2015 The Best Books Of All Time -- A (Partial) List Of Books I've Read Organized by Author Updated July 17, 2021 Here's a very incomplete master list of books I've read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is my list organized by author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've got another list organized by rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tend to focus on good books or authors I've read a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't see the point of including a book I didn't like by someone most people haven't heard about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've only got year-by-year lists of my reading going back to 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before that, it's very catch as catch can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since I've also considerably winnowed down my personal library without noting the books I got rid of over the years, I don't even have a good record of the books I SAVED for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So please understand that this isn't remotely comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I seem overly generous in the number of 3 1/2 and 4 star books, well those are simply the ones I remember best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The many minor books I consumed over the years (especially reams and reams of sci-fi, fantasy and mysteries) have faded from memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any weird gaps (I've read a lot more Dickens than I've listed, for example) are perhaps because I don't remember with enough specificity what I thought of certain books to rate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Art Garfunkel and Peter Bogdanovich had the right idea! Keep a list, everyone; you'll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I wouldn't give for index cards with my brief thoughts on the movies I watched, books I read, albums I heard from a young age onward....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
