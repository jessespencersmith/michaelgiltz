February 16, 2016What the Dickens?Armando Iannucci’s sour, indi!erent adaptation of ‘DavidCopper"eld’! September 11, 2020 "Michael GiltzDo what you want with Charles Dickens! Or Shakespeare or Jane Austen or Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss or any othergreat artist’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Modernize their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Switch genders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go non-binary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cast people of color inroles not written for people of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cast Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Magoo in roles not written for visually-impairedcartoon characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Set the story in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It really doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this will help you createa good movie, but none of it will stop you from making a good one either.Director and co-screenwriter Armando Iannucci does quite a bit of this in his new "lm The PersonalHistory Of David Copper"eld.He employs color-blind casting, led by the charming Dev Patel as our titular hero and the evenmore delightful Rosalind Eleazar as Agnes Wick"eld, David’s friend and eventual love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She juststands there while intelligence and warmth and heat and light simply burst o! the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ourappreciation for Copper"eld immediately falters when he talks to Agnes but doesn’t immediatelythrow himself at her feet in admiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a lifetime of watching art created with color-blind casting, where anyone might be cast in anypart; or intentional casting, where one considers how diverse actors will bring alive certain roles oraspects of a play/movie/etc.; and movie-star casting, the act of hiring a famous person so you canget the damn thing made in the "rst place, I simply refer to any and all of this as “casting.”Iannucci also employs a modestly meta device of framing the "lm as a public reading by CharlesDickens, a famed speaker/performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Iannucci goes nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dickens strolls from the stage intothe birth of his autobiographical character David Copper"eld and observes the goings-on and then#its to the next scene and you think, oh gosh! Iannucci soon drops such shenanigans except for theoccasional touch here and there and it comes to nought.Sure, the "lm might have characters relate a story while projecting the image of that very eventonto a blanket held up behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they might even brush aside that blanket to proceed tothe next scene at an entirely di!erent location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And by god someone might address the audienceby breaking the fourth wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what? Iannucci makes clear this is not your father’s Dickensadaptation, especially if your father is David Lean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet unless it serves a purpose, such frippery isneither here nor there.THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF DAVID COPPERFIELD ★(1/5 stars)Directed by: Armando IannucciWritten by: Simon Blackwell &amp; Armando Iannucci (based on the novel by Charles Dickens)Starring: Dev Patel, Tilda Swinton, Hugh Laurie, Rosalind Eleazar, Ben WhishawRunning time: 119 mins Still, we have a great cast performing the gist of a great novel, indeed a stone cold masterpiece byan author with more than his fair share of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why does this version make me so very unhappy?The fault, I fear, is Iannucci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His scabrous heart is a poor, poor "t for the humane universe ofDickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iannucci’s career is "lled with high points: the clueless second-rater Alan Partridge, aprecursor to David Brent in The O$ce; the spot-on mockery of government and politicians via TheThick Of It, In The Loop and, of course, Veep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever their merits, you wouldn’t say these worksare bursting with love and empathy, would you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilarious? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mocking? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kind? Uh, no.Dickens, however, is kind to everyone, even the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Villains may be hateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haplesscharacters may be foolish and prattle on or exhibit weird obsessions or be just plain loony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theirnames smack of caricature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they are alive, all of them and Dickens sees them as humanwhether good or bad or, as in most of us, an ever-changing combination of both.Read David Copper"eld and you’ll remember Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Micawber as the kindest of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, he’s his ownworst enemy and rather foolish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to the cruelties of the law, Micawber and his family are fora time trapped in debtor’s prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he provides shelter to the young Copper"eld and through hisessential decency helps foil a villainous plot and ultimately enjoys the success he deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watchthis "lm and Micawber is an absurdity, a fool, a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not even Peter Capaldi can rescue thepoor man from Iannucci’s indi!erence.Our hero’s great-Aunt Betsey Trotwood is monomaniacally focused on her niece producing a girl,so David’s birth is quite a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bene Gesserit have nothing on Betsey Trotwood.Nonetheless, she is generous when needed, with a tragic disappointment in love that deepens hertremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the "lm, Tilda Swinton’s Trotwood is simply bonkers.Iannucci is better with the villains, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David’s step-father Edward Murdstone and step-auntJane are suitably hateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet they’re so vicious you can’t accept his mother would let them in thedoor, much less marry the man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iannucci even manages to coax out a bad performance from BenWhishaw, no easy task though a godawful wig helps tremendously.It’s ok not to like the villains, even if they’re such cardboard ones you’re afraid to hiss too loudly forfear they’ll fall down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you don’t even like David’s friends, whether it’s his mother or his servantPeggotty, here seen as little more than an embarrassment the young David Copper"eld will soonoutgrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When David opens his tiny lodgings to the Micawbers and others you don’t think, ahhthey’ve made a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You think, get this rabble away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even David isn’t particularly likable, fallingfor his obnoxious schoolmate Steerforth, ignoring the delightful Agnes as she waits patiently forhim to get a clue and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then, Iannucci doesn’t like anyone here either.Looking back on his work, he seems never to like anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not liking boorish radio and TVpresenters or political hacks is one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not liking any of the characters in a Dickens novel is thesame as not liking humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The humor curdles when it’s not softened by understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thedrama diminishes when you don’t give a toss what happens to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if Iannucci doesn’t care,why should we?#$Tags: Armando Iannucci, Ben Whishaw, David Copper"eld, Dev Patel, Peter Capaldi, RosalindEleazar Michael GiltzMichael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas ofentertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for the NewYork Post, New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Hu$ngtonPost, Premiere Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the LosAngeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He co-hosts the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox.%You May Also Like Leave a ReplyYour email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required "elds are marked *Comment Name *Email *Website Post Comment I'm not a robot reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Featured Stories Diana Rigg, Style Icon!
