Factory) ALFRED HITCHCOCK: THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION ($99.98 BluRay; Universal Studios Home Entertainment) DC UNIVERSE TENTH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION ($299.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.)

Anyone got a 4K TV and player in your life? Maybe they’re getting one for Christmas? They’re going to want to show it off! Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar has its flaws but by god it’s eye-popping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terminator 2 has ALWAYS set the standard for picture and sound wow on new formats and this much-anticipated movie is finally, truly coming out on 4K the day after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pre-order and give them one treat they really won’t see coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And 4K doesn’t have to mean big spectacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The beautifully remastered, classic TV specials of the Peanuts wow in any format but they deserve 4K too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAMURAI JACK THE COMPLETE SERIES ($112.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) ROWAN &amp; MARTIN’S LAUGH-IN: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($249.95 DVD; TimeLife ) STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE — THE COMPLETE SERIES ($144.99 DVD; Paramount) ERNIE KOVACS: TAKE A GOOD LOOK ($69.97 DVD; Shout! Factory) FIREFLY COMPLETE SERIES 15TH ANNIVERSARY ($29.99 BluRay; 20th Century Fox) BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER COMPLETE SERIES ($199.99 DVD; 20th Century Fox)A TOWN CALLED PANIC: THE COLLECTION ($24.97 BluRay; Shout! Factory) THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO COMPLETE SERIES ($89.98 DVD; Paramount) EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS THE COMPLETE SERIES ($33.99 DVD; Paramount) Great collections of TV shows to please everyone and fine fare for the whole family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samurai Jack is a terrific animated series and the adult fans of Kurosawa will be shocked to find themselves drawn in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laugh-In is best for those who remember the show when it first aired, but good/bad jokes are forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Trekkies insist Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek series of all; isn’t it time you found out why? Ernie Kovacs was a remarkable TV innovator and fans of Letterman and oddball tv will savor a collection of his truly bizarre game show Take A Good Look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of westerns and sci-fi love Firefly and hey, if we all buy that series again maybe they’ll reboot it! And Buffy ! It’s Buffy .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do I need to say more? A Town Called Panic is an oddball stop-motion TV series ideal for those who miss Pee-wee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grandparents will enjoy The Streets of San Francisco but it’s police drama comfort food for most anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Everybody Hates Chris is a very good sitcom, spot-on family entertainment and who doesn’t enjoy another chance to salute Terry Crews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s excellent here as the dad and a strong man in real life who stood up for men and everyone who have been violated, harassed and taken advantage of with dignity, righteous anger and a refusal to be goaded by the lesser men in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not funny, just true .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the show is funny and true and the price is great!DUNKIRK ($35.99 BluRay; Warner Home Video) DAWSON CITY: FROZEN TIME ($34.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber) 47 METERS DOWN ($39.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) MOTHER! ($31.99 BluRay; Paramount) THE FOUNDER ($19.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) Some of the best films of the year! Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan’s best film to date and only improves on a second viewing as you appreciate even more how it’s put together so ingeniously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dawson City: Frozen Time is yet another “found cinema” gem from director Bill Morrison. 47 Meters Down is a great B movie for the Quentin Tarantino in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mother! is not one of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was just seeing if you were paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it’s a conversation starter, a test for cineastes or just a way to blow the mind of an unsuspecting relative who sees it and says, “Oh, I like Jennifer Lawrence.” Sit back and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes, Michael Keaton’s The Founder contains one of the best performances of 2016 and is a cult classic waiting to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE VIETNAM WAR ($129.99 BluRay; PBS) Easy to take for granted, as Ken Burns is these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even by his standards, this is a remarkable work about the defining battle for Vietnam, the American soul, journalism and the importance of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAURICE 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($30.99 BluRay; Cohen Film Collection/Sony Pictures) HEAT AND DUST ($34.99 BluRay; Cohen Film Collection/Sony Pictures) BAMBI SIGNATURE COLLECTION ($24.96 BluRay; Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) PINOCCHIO SIGNATURE COLLECTION ($39.99 BluRay; Disney) THE TAISHO TRILOGY ($99.95 BluRay; Arrow Academy) THE WHALES OF AUGUST ($29.95 BluRay; Kino Classics)BLAKE EDWARDS’ THE PINK PANTHER FILM COLLECTION ($99.99 BluRay; Shout! Factory) It’s never too late to catch up with classics like these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Ivory (riding high with his script for Call Me By Your Name ) and Ismail Merchant teamed up for countless distinguished films, including their earlier gay gem Maurice and Heat and Dust , a period film that came before their commercial heyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would be hard pressed to name my favorite Disney animated film (especially if that included all of Pixar) but I might well settle on Bambi .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or Pinocchio .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are offered in gorgeous new prints and filled with extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, the Taisho Trilogy is proof that I still have a lot to learn about Japanese cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Films capturing great artists in the twilight of their career have a special pull for film buffs, no matter the actual quality of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence our fondness for On Golden Pond and The Whales Of August, a lovely valentine for Lillian Gish, Bette Davis, Vincent Price and Ann Southern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sure the quality varies to a crazy degree, but the Blake Edwards’ Pink Panther Collection is still laugh out loud funny most of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOWNTON ABBEY: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ($129.99 BluRay; PBS) DOWNTON ABBEY: THE EXHIBITION ($30 for adults; $28 seniors; $15 for kids) It’s sad but true: at some point, you have to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Put the BluRay player remote down and brave the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps you live in New York City or are visiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps you already own Downton Abbey on DVD or BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps you also find yourself watching the marathons on PBS despite yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If so, the traveling show Downton Abbey: The Exhibition is perfect for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Self-guided tours are about $30 though they also offer special party events, dining and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Located on 57th Street in Manhattan, you can explore multiple floors that offer stories about the show, history lessons about the time period, rooms set up to look like the servant’s dining hall and the like, of course a display of the gorgeous outfits created for the main characters and worn on the show and naturally lots and lots of clips from the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may not get puckish commentary from handsome devil Allen Leech as he joins you on a stroll through the exhibit the way a press tour enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then isn’t the point of privilege to make sure others are envious of what you enjoy without a blush?
