And her Mary Poppins was equally splendidand served a much better spoof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd already blocked the godawful movie Mary Poppins Returns from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I especially disliked the bathos of "The Place Where Lost Things Go," a cloying ballad that seemed to suggest to children thattheir mother wasn't really dead, just misplaced, perhaps lost in the seat cushions of the couch or buried under a pile of stuff in the attic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ok, that's not precisely what it tries to say, but it's perfect forsatirizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alessandrini turns it into a ballad called "The Place WhereThe Lost Shows Go," an ode to the flops and forgotten musicals ofyesteryear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes and wigs capture the practically perfect nanny to a t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The flood posters from old flops will warm the heart of any theater lover and the number is easily appreciated by even casualfans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Stuart's performance is drily perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, if my praisingStuart causes some backstage tension, they can always write a songabout it!BOOKS: Don't Bother Trying To "Find Me" THEATER: "The Sound Inside" Gets Muffled By Final...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Stuff and Nonsense for Friendly Crowds --...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "Scotland, PA" or, The Bloody King Of Bur...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "For Colored Girls" Returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally!

Actually, the song title alone is a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, I thought the numerous digs in this number work far better if you've actually seen the currentproduction. (My guest disagreed and since he hasn't seen the current revival but laughed at the spoof, what do I know?) Similarly, I suppose the grim nature of Irish drama is always a rich target and "How AreThings In Irish Drama" is kind of funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since The Ferrymanclosed more than a year ago this number already feels outdated when Forbidden Broadway: The Next Generation just opened! Finally, I think the Harry Potter bit is off target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alessandrini's spoofs are almost always funny because they come from a great love for musicals and an encyclopedic knowledge of what's happening on stageand behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He mocks the super-high prices of the two-part play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that take is about seven months out of date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever since the original cast left, the box office for Harry Potter has dropped in half, from more than $2 million a week to more often $1 million. (It's still sold out and stillworth seeing.) Discount ticket offers have been coming fast and furious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you can find a lot of bargains -- relatively speaking -- to this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you were going to mock anything, it should have beenthat .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you want to talk high ticket prices, Moulin Rouge! has been charging (and getting) eye-watering premium prices from its firstpreview, while Hadestown brazenly doubled its prices the day after winning the Tony for Best Musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I expect Forbidden Broadway to be on the cutting edge of gossip and this is one time the show missesthe mark.► July (7) ► June (3) ► May (6) ► April (10) ► March (5) ► February (1) ► January (8) ► 2018 (38) ► 2017 (6) ► 2016 (2) ► 2015 (29) ► 2014 (2) ► 2013 (5) ► 2012 (17) ► 2011 (15) ► 2010 (10) ► 2009 (43) ► 2008 (86) ► 2007 (781) ► 2006 (2412) ► 2005 (5)Not that it matters! Two or three numbers that spoof stuff you haven't seen is probably par for the course for most people attending this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the time, you're a big enough fan to get the joke anywayor you can enjoy the performances and songs in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That'ssurely the case for this edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Star Trek universe, the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation is arguably the best of all the shows in the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't seen enough of Forbidden Broadway during its illustrious history to make that claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Forbidden Broadway:The Next Generation sure is fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
