                <p>T U E S D A Y , O C T O B E R 1 9 , 2 0 0 4Reservists Who Refused Orders: The TruthStarts To Come Outby Michael in New York on 10/19/2004 05:40:00 PMThe true story about those reservists who refused a direct order isstarting to come out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obeying orders is essential to a working military-- it ain't a democracy out there and every mission is potentially asuicide mission -- but the situation these soldiers apparently faced isa farce straight out of Joseph Heller's "Catch 22" or one of yourbleaker episodes of "M*A*S*H."It comes from the NYT and is based on www.hackworth.com -- a website run by a retired Army colonel that works to channel criticismabout commanders.In short, the 13th Corps Support Command -- led by Brig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gen.James E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chambers -- apparently has terrible morale and has beensingled out by grunts for repeated criticism.The soldiers involved in this mission had made complaints up thechain of command for months about the dangerously poor quality oftheir trucks and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then they were sent on a mission todeliver jet fuel that lasted four to five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trucks -- due forrepairs -- broke down and ultimately the fuel was rejected because itwas contaminated with diesel fuel.The troops returned late Oct. 12 and were roused at 4 a.m. the nextmorning and were ordered to deliver the same useless fuel to anotherlocation much farther north than the last stop.Imagine: being ordered to risk your lives on an utterly pointlessmission of delivering tainted jet fuel that would be no use to anyoneand ordered to do it with equipment and trucks that weredangerously in disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They went up the chain of command andeven got a civilian to confirm the fuel was tainted and useless butthey were ordered out anyway.Would you go on a life-threatening mission as a pointless exercise inmilitary inefficiency and stupidity?
