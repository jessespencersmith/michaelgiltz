                <p>DVDs: Bourne Legacy, Trouble With TheCurve and Other Movies You'll Regret inthe Morning THE BOURNE LEGACY ($34.98 BluRay combo; Universal) TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE ($35.99 BluRay combo; Warner Bros.)ICE AGE: CONTINENTAL DRIFT($39.99 BluRay combo; FOX)TOTAL RECALL ($35.99 BluRay combo; Sony)KILLER JOE ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)TED ($34.98 BluRay combo; Universal)-- You know the walk of shame? That's the idea in the movies that when someone has a one-night stand they regret, they have a walk of shame home the next morning, certaineveryone is aware of their bad, baddecision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You should think about thewalk of shame you have to make afterrenting or buying a lame movie, thetrudge back to Redbox or Blockbusteror your neighborhood store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You knewThe Bourne Legacy wasn't going to be any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You knew your friends hadseen it and been lukewarm at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Youknew you'd spend the entire moviewaiting for Matt Damon and debatingwhether Jeremy Renner is a movie star.And yet still you rented it rather thansome classic movie from the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andyou return it and the attendant says,"How was it?" and you say, "Mehh." Because what else can you say? What can you say about Trouble With The Curve? That Justin Timberlake is getting better as an actor? That at least Clint Eastwood didn't talk to a chair?Can you explain why you haven't reallyliked any of the Ice Age movies but at least you know what you're getting andso you get it anyway? Will you debatewith friends how this Total Recallmanaged to avoid all the quirkyelements of the last Total Recall and how both of them aren't nearly as goodas the work they're based on? Will thatbe fun? At least Killer Joe is based on an acclaimed play and MatthewMcConaughey is having a career year.But shouldn't it have come after about adozen other genuinely great crime movies you've never seen? As for Ted , isn't it really a funny idea... for five minutes? Wouldn't it have been a lotfunnier as a sketch on SNL rather than a feature-length movie? And even if youlaughed, aren't you secretly dreadingthe sequel? Even though you knowyou'll see it? Because that's what keepsyou repeating the walk of shame againApril 30, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 12/18/2012 11:04 amand again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE QATSI TRILOGY ($79.95 BluRay; Criterion) A MAN VANISHES ($44.98 DVD; Icarus -- out Dec. 22) PURPLE NOON ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- Koyaanisqatsi is one of the all-time great films and was certainly the best movie of 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've never seen it, this Criterion BluRay releasewill be a revelation for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisdocumentary has been so influentialthat it might not stun the way it did in1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie drew upon manyavant garde techniques andpopularized them and its DNA can beseen in movies, music videos,commercials and films ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On avery basic level, it is a nature film, usingtime-lapse photography to capture theworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It moves from the desert into thecity up into space as it follows the pathof a rocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wordless narrative is set to the score of Philip Glass, which was created alongside the film, with each influencing the other every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Godfrey Reggio surely intends a commentary on modern life, but the movie is greater than anyreductive idea such as "nature good"and "mankind bad." In fact, the beautyhe captures in the streaming traffic onthe highway or a production line in afactory complicates such ideastremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is hypnoticallybeautiful, transfixing and in this beautifultransfer will immediately become afavorite "demo" BluRay for hometheater enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aestheticallyarresting, emotional, philosophicallyintriguing, Koyaanisqatsi is above all a work of beauty, utterly singular andstriking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Criterion set does it full justice with bountiful extras, shorts, interviews, essays and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It truly was singular, though Reggio did try and recapture that flash of brilliance with two lesser sequels, Powaqqatsi and Noqoyqatsi .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are their adherents but no one would argue they're a patch on Koyaanisqatsi .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shohei Imamura has won the top prize at Cannes twice butmost of his work is little known in theU.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This marvelous release of hislandmark documentary film A ManVanishes should change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You not only get the movie -- in which Imamurainterviews the family and friends of amissing businessman and slowlyinsinuates himself into their lives -- butyou also get five more documentaryfilms from the early 1970s, key works inhis career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means this DVD isreally an exceptional boxed set of a major talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, any fans of The Talented Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ripley should check out Purple Noon , an earlier French adaptation by Rene Clement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has lessemotional complexity than MattDamon's version but Alain Delon is soremarkably handsome as themurderous charmer Tom Ripley that allcritical faculties go out the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THE COMPLETE TELEVISIONCOLLECTION ($359.99 DVD; CBS/Paramount)J.A.G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COMPLETE SERIES($359.99 DVD; CBS/Paramount) -- Two more deluxe TV boxed sets that do everything right... except the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mission Impossible contains the entire innovative original series and the revival from the 1980s in a 56-DVD set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAG contains all 10 seasons of the journeyman TV series that was foolishlycancelled by NBC and then flourishedon CBS and spawned two massive hitspin-offs: NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has any show that close to death ever proven so ultimatelysuccessful? Each contains bonusfeatures and other extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both arecontained nicely compact sets: MissionImpossible is in a fun, dynamite stick- looking box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAG is in a handsome briefcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem occurs whenyou open them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mission comes in round tins for each season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're alittle tricky to stack and unstack andmore annoyingly each tin contains a pile of discs in a flimsy photo album container that's a pain to pull out and remove the disc you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAG really has a handsome, sturdy case that makes the cheap cardboard holders foreach season all the more disappointing.They have no identifying titles on theside so you can't take them out andplace them on a shelf on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TheDVDs themselves are in a stacked,folder-type container that's tiresome todeal with when you want to remove orput back in a disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the bright side,the sets themselves are at leastcompact and can fit on mostbookshelves nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad thedesigners of boxed sets never considerthe people who will actually want to usethem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PITCH PERFECT ($34.98 BluRay combo; Universal) SLEEPWALK WITH ME ($29.98BluRay; IFC)PREMIUM RUSH ($35.99 BluRay combo; Sony)ARBITRAGE ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)WHY STOP NOW ($29.98 BluRay; IFC)REHEARSAL FOR A SICILIANTRAGEDY ($24.95 DVD; First Run Features) -- Unlike the batch of moviesthat topped this column, here are some films you might take a chance on thatcould pay off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pitch Perfect is Glee goes to college but it's most notable as the successful feature film debut of directorJason Moore, who scored on Broadwaywith Avenue Q .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike Birbiglia is a distinctive standup comic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw hisshow Sleepwalk With Me and this film smartly expands his tale with a look atthe life of a standup comic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PremiumRush is nonsense, of course, but it is fun to watch Michael Shannon lettingdown his hair as a villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God knowswhat Joseph Gordon-Levitt wasthinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arbitrage is a drama about a Madoff-like schemer whose schemesare blowing up in his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Gere stars and he's often best when playing compromised characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Susan Sarandon and Tim Roth are along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jesse Eisenberg is inthe same fix as Topher Grace, trying tonegotiate that awkward period betweenteen and adult roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why Stop Now is only a way station but Eisenberg'sessential appeal remains intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally,if you're a fan of puppetry like me, JohnTurturro's journey to Sicily andimmersion in that art form will please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GIRLS COMPLETE FIRST SEASON ($49.99 BluRay; HBO)SHAMELESS SECOND SEASON($49.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.)41 ($19.98 DVD; HBO) HOUSE OF LIES FIRST SEASON ($45.98 DVD; Showtime) CAPTAIN CORNELIUS CARTOON'S CARTOON LAGOON VOL. 1 ($12.99 DVD; Cartoon Lagoon) THE LIFE &amp; TIMES OF TIM THIRDSEASON ($29.98 DVD; HBO) CALIFORNICATION FIFTH SEASON($45.98 DVD; Showtime) -- LenaDunham's HBO show Girls is by far the most distinctive series coming to DVDthis week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real test for this comedywill be how it fares in season two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CanDunham shake off the accolades andmake the show better? Shameless has been lost in the shadows on Showtimebut it's a great showcase for William H.Macy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The documentary 41 looks set to be a franchise for HBO -- this one looksat George Herbert Walker Bush and now they're tackling Bill Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don Cheadle is having fun as amanagement consultant on House OfLies but I'm happiest to see Kristen Bell back on TV since Veronica Mars.Captain Cornelius Cartoon's CartoonLagoon hopes to have fun with old cartoons the way MST3K did with old movies, starting here with the mumbling Popeye and a weird Captain Nemo tale.Tim keeps bumbling on in the thirdseason of his not-so animated life buthe's a model of self-control comparedto the sexaholic of David Duchovny in Californication .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DICK TRACY ($26.50 BluRay; Touchstone) TRAILER WAR ($27.97 DVD; Draft House Films)MIAMI CONNECTION ($27.97 DVD; Draft House Films)THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY ($19.97 BluRay; Shout) -- Warren Beatty madea bold stylistic gamble that still pays offon this excellent-looking DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure,you can see the painted backdrops inscene after scene, but it's intentional --this Dick Tracy is all cartoon colors and artificiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Sylbert's productiondesign is one for the ages, thoughBeatty didn't quite match it with a toneand flippancy that would have made themovie soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it holds up very welland it's a pity no one bothered to discuss this genuine roll of the dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And surely someday soon someone will tackle Dick Tracy again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trailer War is a foolproof compilation of nutty film trailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two hours long, it's bestsampled in short doses before whateverfilm you're watching each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MiamiConnection is just the sort of turkey that would be enshrined in Trailer War ; it's one of those awful flicks that fans havetaken to heart as gloriously awful to thepoint of... well, awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they enjoy it.Others will surely prefer the failed butfar more ambitious adaptation of Henryjames, The Portrait Of A Lady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane Campion faltered for the first time here,though Nicole Kidman gives her all asIsabel Archer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extras include a newdocumentary about the making of thefilm. ***** Most titles listed here will be availablein multiple formats and in multiplecombinations, including DVD, BluRay,digital download, video on demand,streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The formatlisted is the format provided for review,not all the formats available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is oftenthe most expensive version with themost extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do check individual titlesfor availability in all their various guises and price points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, alsocalled Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflixand gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-Rays with the understanding that he would beconsidering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally,he does not guarantee to review and hereceives far more titles than he cancover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz</p>
