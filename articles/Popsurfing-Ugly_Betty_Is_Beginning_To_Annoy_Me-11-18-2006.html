But I'm sorry, the kid isCLEARLY intended to be gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He could be different or like fashion orbe an odd duck in a million different ways but every single line this kidutters is coded behavior that inescapably indicates the boy is gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sowhy have they created this adorable, positive gay role model of a kid(Justin is comfortable with himself, clearly) and then waste timedenying what they've done?One possibility is the young actor himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's only 12 and in thearticle linked to above he explicitly says we aren't supposed to assumehis character is gay just because he acts super-gay every single momenthe's onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, when casting a gay kid, movie and TV people havea delicate tightrope to walk, even today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By and large, you cast kids whoNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "Ugly Betty" Is Beginning To Annoy Mehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/ugly-betty-is-beginning... 1 of 37/28/09 2:22 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SBiboyAaronMichael in New York POPSURFING.COM: "Ugly Betty" Is Beginning To Annoy Mehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/ugly-betty-is-beginning... 2 of 37/28/09 2:22 PMPOPSURFING.COM: "Ugly Betty" Is Beginning To Annoy Mehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/ugly-betty-is-beginning... 3 of 37/28/09 2:22 PM</p>
