The Pipettes / "Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me" FAVORITE REISSUES 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bob Dylan - The Other Side Of The Mirror: Live At The Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965 (revelatory documentary film) 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prefab Sprout - Steve McQueen (Steely Dan-like pop stripped down beautifully) 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Culture - Two Sevens Clash 30th Anniversary Edition (anthemic reggae) 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmylou Harris - Songbird (the queen of Americana) 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joy Division - album reissues 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Various Artists -- City Of Dreams: A Collection Of New Orleans Music (a joyous dive into the vaults of Rounder)7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Van Morrison - The Best Of Van Morrison Volume 3 (if you pick and choose carefully, his last decade sounds damn good)8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Warnes - Famous Blue Raincoat (a perfect intro to Leonard Cohen) 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Traveling Wilburys - The Traveling Wilburys Collection (shambling, genial but some undeniable singles)10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pink Floyd - The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn / Moby Grape - Listen My Friends: The Best Of Moby Grape (awesome psychedelia) THE BEST CDS OF 2007 - THE EXTENDED LIST 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sharon Jones &amp; The Dap-Kings - 100 Days 100 Nights (classic soul)/ Various Artists - The Great Debaters Soundtrack (juke joint music) - Sharon Jones is the beginning and the end, an old school singer who sounds like she came straight from the Stax studios through a time tunnel and into the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've struggled all year to define the difference between "retro" music that justsort of apes the past and the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can't define it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You just feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones and the Dap-Kings have been steeped in classic soul for years and this album is their greatest achievement yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fanatics will love the little touches, like the way the songs sometimes fade out quickly just like the old pop singles where a tune would simply run out of space on the 45 and they'd have to dial down the sound abruptly at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this isn't just for hardcore collectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great, great stuff, withone pounding, unforgettable, heart-pumping song after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think Aretha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think Otis Redding.Think Brooklyn's Sharon Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's all over the soundtrack to the Denzel Washington feel-gooddrama The Great Debaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie was too soft-focus for my taste but credit Washington for great taste in music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is like a night at a juke joint...if the juke joint happened to be jammed fullof some of the best talent around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones (who has a cameo in the movie) sings everything from gospel to blues, with Alvin Youngblood Hart the prime mover and shaker, whether dueting with Jones or backed by the Carolina Chocolate Drops string band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone adventurous enough to own the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack should run right out and pick this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Saturday night, put on 100 Days 100 Nights and The Great Debaters back to back and you've got yourself a party. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patty Griffin - Children Running Through (career-capping Americana) - For much of the year, until Jones slipped past her, I was convinced this would be the album of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like John Hiatt's classic Bring The Family, this is the crowning achievement in a durable career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've always admired Griffin, her albums were fine, people regularly covered her songs...but it never quite all came together for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Till now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the funky, syncopated "Stay On The Ride" to the story song of "Trapeze" and the rafters-raising "Heavenly Days," this is a talented artist delivering just the right songs with just the right musicians at just the right moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

People can talk all they want about Kid A and Amnesiac and Hail To The Thief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The truth is that Radiohead delivered genius with The Bends and OK Computer and then ran screaming from the massive sales and acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, finally, they've embraced again their apparently effortless ability to deliver brilliant, thought-provoking songs with melodies that stride continents with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great stuff. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tinariwen - Aman Iman: Water Is Life (desert rock) - Don't ask me why or how, but I suddenly realized that half the world music I'd been obsessed with this year came from Mali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tinariwen is a desert collective, a despised minority scrabbling out an existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And out in the middle of nowhere, Tinariwen plug in and deliver rock -- and rock that builds on their folk traditions with the swagger of the Rolling Stones. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Plant and Alison Krauss - Raising Sand (adult pop) - Strange bedfellows, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a heart-stopping paring with Plant's stadium-ready vocals pared down and Krauss's delicate yearning given a swift kick in the pants, all in service of gems like "Please Read The Letter" and "Let Your Loss Be Your Lesson." Perhaps the unlikeliest triumph yet by producer T Bone Burnett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfect for mum and dad. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The White Stripes - Icky Thump (bluesy, stomping rock n roll) - I can't quite figure out how people turn on to some of their albums and turn off others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The White Stripes strike me as ferociously committed to exploring anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who can't love the yelp of "Little Cream Soda," the catchiness of "You Don't Know What Love Is" or the roar of "Icky Thump?" I keep waiting for them to take a wrong step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They haven't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the louder you play it the better it sounds, which is always a good sign. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terence Blanchard - A Tale of God's Will (a requiem for Katrina) (melancholic jazz / Jonny Greenwood - There Will Be Blood (spooky, spine-tingling score) - Two instrumental compositions that haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blanchard based his new album in part on the score he delivered for Spike Lee'sdocumentary about Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this album - which also includes pieces by his bandmembers - is a rich and moving work in its own right, sad, mournful, defiant, angry and somehow hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't get inspired so much as spooked by the terrific tunes Radiohead's Greenwood used so marvelously in the Daniel Day-Lewis film There Will Be Blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unshakeable. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Earle - Washington Square Serenade / Suzanne Vega - Beauty &amp; Crimes (country and folk pop triumphs both, but don't call it a comeback) - What a year for Steve Earle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He filmed hisfinal scenes for the HBO drama The Wire (easily one of the best shows of all time), recorded the theme song for it and delivered his strongest album in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you enjoyed Earle in the past but haven't paid attention in a while, climb back on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same goes for Suzanne Vega, who offers a tribute to New York City in the best possible style: by writing sharp, unsentimental, intelligent pop that digs deep. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie T - Panic Prevention / Livesavas - Gutterfly (Brit rap; Seventies funk fantasia) - For a few years now, I've been arguing that the best rap is coming out of the UK, thanks to The Streets, Dizzee Rascal and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie T continues the tradition with the droll wit that comes so easily to the Brits and an offbeat soundscape that is his secret weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then along comes Lifesavas to prove America hasn't completely floundered yet when it comes to rap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've produced the soundtrack to an imaginary Seventies blaxploitation flick and yes, flutes, funky bass and groovy dialogue are all on tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sensational and everything Jay-Z's album wanted to be but wasn't. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amy Winehouse - Back To Black (bruised retro soul) - Sharon Jones pops up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not vocally, but via her band the Dap-Kings, would pumped tremendous life into much of this album,including the unstoppable single "Rehab." Winehouse is the real deal, but it never hurts to have theright backing band. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arcade Fire - Neon Bible (art rock a la Talking Heads) - They have a gift for creating tension, the feeling that SOMETHING momentous is about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rousing stuff. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy Bey - Ain't Necessarily So (searching jazz vocals) - Who knows why this live album recorded a decade ago has stayed on the shelf? Bey had just come back into the limelight with a hitalbum and this set shows him suffused with the joy of doing what he loves and knowing that after along dry spell that people were listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't have the molasses pacing of Shirley Horn butthey both know how to dig deep. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fountains of Wayne - Traffic and Weather (pure pop) / Ron Sexsmith - Time Being (purer pop) -- Who knows why certain acts fall in and out of favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a brief moment, FoW wasthe toast of the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing changed but the spotlight moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will probably find themagain when their work on the Broadway-bound musical Cry-Baby is heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traffic and Weather proves they've been creating pure pop all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ron Sexsmith is so dependablycatchy and literate that magazines have run out of things to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's another Sexsmith album British CountryFolkGrammysJazzMaliPopRock n RollSwedenUkWorld Music Media : Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Media : Geoffrey Dunn Sarah, Greta &amp; Scientology--Part II: Van Susteren Doth Protest Too Much Media : Adele Stan O'Reilly and Barbara Walters: A Very LimitedView Related Tags Michael Giltz: Alternate Grammys: The Best CDs of 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/alternate-grammys-the-be_b_85801.html [4/5/2009 7:55:14 PM]that will make pop lovers swoon but fail to conquer the charts? Hardly words to begin a cover story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul McCartney has an heir, indeed. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tabu Ley Rochereau - The Voice Of Lightness (floating, Al Green-like world music) - "The Voice of Lightness?" Hmm, catchy nickname.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then you play the first track of this two disccompilation by the Congo legend and suddenly you're floating up to the sky the way you did thefirst time you heard Al Green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addictive pop. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Feeling - Twelve Stops and Home (Seventies AM radio) / The Fratellis - Costello Music (raucous rock) - Listen to The Feeling and you'll get a big, goofy grin on your face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Midlake,they traffic in a Seventies rock radio vibe with brilliant tunes like "Sewn" and "I Want You Now"that will have you checking the liner notes of this UK band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is this a greatest hits compilation? Orjust an album that could be? It doesn't hurt that the lead singer toys with saying he's bisexual justlike Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ah, the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their compatriots the Fratellis make a big noise with infectious rock thatis like Elvis (Costello) in a particularly upbeat mood. 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teddy Thompson - Upfront &amp; Down Low (dignified country classics) / Richard Thompson - Sweet Warrior (sterling rock) / Linda Thompson - Versatile Heart (delicate folk pop) - The Thompson clan does itself proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teddy does a covers album of country classics anddigging into sneering numbers like "You Finally Said Something Good (When You Said Goodbye)"seemed to release the inner swagger in the reserved Thompson's lovely voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'll be fascinating tosee how making it affects his next solo album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pop Richard - world's greatest guitarist, thank youvery much - delivers yet another impeccable solo album, his best since Mock Tudor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seemed to bemerely good, but suddenly in the second half one corker after another was released and you justshake your head with pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mum Linda threatened her triumphant comeback albumFashionably Late might be her last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bollocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't quite as exceptional, but it's always a joy to her her sing. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bassekou Kouyate &amp; Ngoni ba - Segu Blue (irresistible world music for people mourning Ali Farka) - More music from Mali, with Kouyate apparently the first person to center an albumaround the stringed instrument the Ngoni, hence the album's pairing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like saying "Eric Clapton&amp; Stratocaster.") This isn't some National Geographic special, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll be on your feet andswaying in minutes. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Herbie Hancock - River: The Joni Letters (Mitchell done proud via jazz) - Hancock says this album was the first time he ever really focused on the lyrics of the songs he was performing.(Mainly because he was working with singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dude, that's the ONLY way to record meaningfulcovers of standards, even if no one is saying the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, he learned his lesson just in time asthis all-star album does right by Joni Mitchell, one of the jazziest of pop's poets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tina Turner is arevelation on "Edith and the Kingpin" (I didn't know she had it in her) but I can't help treasuringLeonard Cohen's spoken word finale, "The Jungle Line." If that doesn't grab you, nothing will. 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Ray Price - Last Of The Breed (country summit) / Levon Helm - Dirt Farmer (Lazarus-like revival) / Porter Wagoner - Wagonmaster (classy send-off) - When pop and rock stars get together, it's often such a "big moment" freighted with import thatlittle of value comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But country and folk and jazz do these summit meetings with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it because of their traditions of front porch and late night jam sessions? I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Willie and Merle and Ray got together and sang a few tunes and somebody knew what was happening was pretty great because they kept the tapes rolling and filled up two CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Levon Helm's comeback after years of fighting illness and being reduced to a ragged whisper is truly heartwarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But heartwarming doesn't make for a good album, just a good story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singing well makes for a good album and that's what he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any volume sacrificed is made up for by sharper insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I haven't thought about Wagoner much since Dolly Parton went solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Marty Stuart gave him a great final bow with this elegant, fitting album that wasn't meant as a tribute or valedictory and is all the more satisfying because of it. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arctic Monkeys - Favourite Worst Nightmare (jagged Brit pop) - Kaiser Chiefs - Yours Truly, Angry Mob (spiky but smooth Brit pop) - These two UK bands are invariably paired in my mind, the way Oasis and Blur were, though there's no rivalry to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But their debuts came outat the same time and I gave round one to the Kaiser Chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Round two goes to Arctic Monkeys but it remains a close call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Monkeys craft better albums but the Chiefs are gonna have one amazing greatest hits CD, thanks to singles like "Ruby" and "The Angry Mob." 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Various Artists - The Roots Of Chica - Psychedelic Cumbias From Peru (garage rock via South America) - utterly "inauthentic" psychedelic rock and roll from Peru that will rock your house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crank it up. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Common - Finding Forever (rap for adults) - a lone voice of sanity in the boring world of American rap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solid and smart, with the added bonus of that addictive theme song for theanimated show The Boondocks as the closer. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Fretwell - Man On The Roof (unheralded UK folk-pop) - I kept seeing this albumMichael Giltz: Alternate Grammys: The Best CDs of 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/alternate-grammys-the-be_b_85801.html [4/5/2009 7:55:14 PM]advertised in the UK press, with some laudatory reviews and intriguing song titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't see any interviews and it never got released here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally I broke down and bought a $28 import (gulp).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His earlier guy-and-a-guitar approach had been fleshed out beautifully, putting meat on the bones of his observant, engaging songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real deal. 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Betty LaVette - The Scene Of The Crime (steeped in wisdom soul) / Mary Weiss - Dangerous Game (old school pop, happily) LaVette came back for good with I've Got My Own Hell To Raise, a great album covering female songwriters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now she's delivered her own response record, this one covering all male songwriters. 120 proof but goes down smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary Weiss is a girl group survivor of the Shangri-Las who said, what the heck, let's do an album and proved she could still raise some hell, herself. 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Josh Ritter - The Historical Conquests Of Josh Ritter (literate folk pop with a smile) -- I've liked his albums for a while but it was seeing Ritter in concert where he just seemed so darn happy to be performing that made me a serious fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another very good album that sinks in slowly and then stays there. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy Palacio &amp; The Garifuna Collective - Watina / Puerto Plata - Mujer de Cabaret (both beautiful, vanishing traditions) -- Finally, some world music now from Mali.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palacio is a pop star in the Caribbean but was persuaded to record an album capturing the elegiac music of the Garifuna peoples, a group reduced to mere hundreds of thousands with their language and culture slipping away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elegant, stirring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plata proves the musical style of son doesn't belong solely to the Cubans He's from the Dominican Republic and after decades where repressive regimes kept his music hidden, the 83 year old makes his recording debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a very basic live recording, but Plata's exuberant swing wins you over easily. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hives - The Black and White Album (confident, swaggering rock) - They came crashing in with a group of other rock bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Hives have gone to the woodshed, studied hard and reallydelivered with this boisterous, infectious work. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Bromberg - Try Me One More Time / John Hammond - Push Comes To Shove (grizzled old white man blues) / Watermelon Slim &amp; The Workers - The Wheel Man (the blues, you fool) - Lots of blues, here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bromberg is heard on his first album in 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like so manybluesman, the years only make them better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hammond doesn't miss a beat and makes it seem easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's Oklahoma native Watermelon Slim that had me rolling in the aisles and not thinking about the blues but just feeling it. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Wyatt - Comicopera (eccentric pop-jazz thingamajig) - Is there anyone in the US to compare to Wyatt? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not Captain Beefheart, really, who always seemed to have stayed out in the sun a tad too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His music is more from the head than the gut, but often breathtakingly beautiful, filled with jazzy chords and meandering melodies that slowly coalesce around a perfect if opaque lyric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Wyatt is more accessible than usual, making this a great entry point for newcomers who are feeling adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No signposts here, but you might bumpinto Brian Eno and Van Dyke Parks.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Real Tuesday Weld - The London Book Of The Dead (sneakily ambitious retro pop) - This UK band might have been much higher on my list if I hadn't discovered them at the lastminute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you know the lovably retro music of Richard Swift, think of this as his UK pal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theydon't really have much in common, other than a love for vintage music and contemporary lyricsthat intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Pink Floyd slipped into the Fifties to rcord a concept album, it might sound likethis. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joan Armatrading - Into The Blues (do call it a comeback) -- Why didn't more people talk about this? Just a great, rousing set of tunes from the too long gone Armatrading. 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Magic Numbers - Those The Brokes (disappointing but good) / Darren Hayes - This Delicate Thing We've Made (good but disappointing) -- Lov the Magic Numbers but I got spoiled by seeing them in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I know how absolutely brilliant they can be and this album (almostas good as their debut) falls short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Darren Hayes of Savage Garden delivers a wildly ambitious,autobiographical double CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's frustrating how hard it is for indie artists to get on the radio.Hayes should be an automatic add for adult contemporary stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, the album could bestronger as a single CD but the problem here isn't the length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the emphasis on the dance floor.Hayes is much, much stronger on pure pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If radio wakes up, a handful of tunes - especially"Words" and "Casey" will be massive, massive hits.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band - Live In Dublin (party in the barn music) - Yep, Bruce delivered a classic album this year, but it wasn't Magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought that album had a terrific batch of songs (his strongest since Tunnel Of Love ) but I just don't like how producer Brendan O'Brien records Bruce's vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They sound smoothed out and bland to me; no personality.Live, his songs were much better than the album version and "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" and"Radio Nowhere" will be on set lists for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for a great album, I prefer this liverecording of his excellent band performing the tunes from The Seeger Sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unbeatable fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz: Alternate Grammys: The Best CDs of 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/alternate-grammys-the-be_b_85801.html [4/5/2009 7:55:14 PM]34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nicole Atkins - Neptune City (brooding, Orbison-like pop) - A very promising debut with touches of Roy Orbison, Phil Spector, Chris Isaak and the like. "The Way It Is" is classic and "Brooklyn's On Fire!" is a gas live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I expect her to get better and better. 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sergio &amp; Odair Assad - Jardim Abandonado (telepathic classical guitar) - two classical guitarists who are so in tune with each other that tunes from Jobim to Debussy to the showstopper - Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" - float by effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone could treat this as aural wallpaper to leave on in the background during afternoon tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pay attention. 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raul Malo - After Hours (countrypolitan with velvet vocals) - The marvelous voice behind once and future country greats the Mavericks, Malo slides into some classic country tunes, sans the quirkiness that enlivened his band's similarly themed album Music For All Occasions. 37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Sondheim -- Company: Original Broadway Cast (2007) (Sondheim, passionately) - My favorite new musical of the year was an Off Off Broadway gem called Yank! about two soldiers falling in love during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm greedily listening to a demo recording of the music andlooking forward to a future production Off Broadway or elsewhere with a full cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for revivals,the best was Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On stage the stunt of having cast members play all the instruments worked beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the cast album, you're left with impassioned performances, led by Raul Esparza'scareer-defining Bobby.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kelly Willis - Translated From Love (country, smartly) - Sure she got a little lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she never lost her voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when Willis was ready to bear down and had just the right pushy sort ofproducer in Chuck Prophet (who kept her out of her comfort zone), the result was perhaps her bestalbum yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've been a fan, come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you haven't, you should be. 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panda Bear - Person Pitch (Brian Wilson on LSD, if that's not redundant)--Trippy, hippy, Beach Boys-like music from a member of Animal Collective. 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over The Rhine - Snow Angels (Christmas rock for NPR listeners) - Their new CD didn't floor me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this second holiday CD from the indie stalwarts blew me away - lots of great originalsmake this a keeper for someone who has literally hundreds of Christmas CDs and can be verypicky. "North Pole Man" alone is destined for lots of mixtapes in the future. 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jens Lekman - Night Falls Over Kortedala (Magnetic Fields via Sweden) - That dreamy lost boy look of Lekman on the cover of his new CD is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He swoons over pop melodies, pours out literate, clever lyrics by the yard and wraps it up in beautiful, larky arrangements that include lotsand lots of strings and choirs and clever little touches. "And I Remember Every Kiss." "Friday NightAt The Drive-In Bingo." "If I Could Cry (it would feel like this)." If you're smiling already, this isfor you. 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ian Hunter - Shrunken Heads (cock rock) - Like an idiot, I never realized Mott The Hoople was more than a one hit wonder thanks to David Bowie's "All The Young Dudes." Some great reissues soon turned my head around and now a new solo CD from head Mott Ian Hunter proves he's still the cock of the walk. 43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beirut - The Flying Cup Club - This kid's debut CD sounded like gypsy music from Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His second CD sounds like it was recorded in a French cabaret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infact, Zach Condon is from New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no idea what's going on here, but I'm still listening. 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Juanes - La Vida (fist-shaking rock) - a Colombian superstar, Juanes is clearly politically committed and that passion pours out of these Spanish-language rockers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Getting better and better. 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Holmes Brothers - State of Grace (master class in the blues) - Everything from Lyle Lovett to Elvis Costello, delivered with grace and verce. 46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova - The Swell Season (you know, those great songs from the movie Once ) - Like many people, I caught up with this solo work by Frames lead singer Hansard via the movie Once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bought this before the soundtrack came out so this is what Ilistened to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A tad too stately for me at times, but the numbers from the movie are just remarkable. 47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan Adams and the Cardinals - Follow The Lights (Americana, again) -- Hey, if Ryan Adams knew when it was going to work and when it wasn't, he'd probably be even happier than you or mere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a few years of just pouring out music wily-nily, he settled down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, Easy Tiger wasn't quite in focus yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this EP is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know why, but it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back for good, I hope. 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Corigliano - Music For String Quartet (American classical) - A shameful lack of classical music this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at least I stayed on top of some contemporary composers, includingCorigliano, who is featured in this album which includes a string quartet, two shorter works and -generously - shares the bill with a string quartet by by the handsome young composer JeffersonFriedman who has studied with Corigliano and others and who has already been commissioned fornumerous pieces including a chamber opera and two orchestral works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One to watch. 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dee Dee Bridgewater - Red Earth: A Malian Journey (jazz meets Mali)/ Abbey Lincoln - Abbey Sings Abbey (astringent jazz) - One more trip to Mali, this time with Bridgewater, who feltsuch an identity with the music of that region (along with physical similarities) between her andMichael Giltz: Alternate Grammys: The Best CDs of 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/alternate-grammys-the-be_b_85801.html [4/5/2009 7:55:14 PM] Michelle Obama's Clothing Has Sean Hannity All Out OfSorts Cenk Uygur: Have WeReached the Tipping Pointon Guns?

(But not written by Feist and her album sadly never held my attention.) 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rihanna / "Umbrella" - Inescapable, sometimes unhappily so. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mika / "Grace Kelly" - Delirious pop; what the radio was made for. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norah Jones / "Thinking About You" - Melody is not her strong suit, which makes this pop gem stand out all the more on her new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe if her voice weren't so bewitching she'd spend more time on creating hooks. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Mellencamp / "Our Country" - an almost embarrassingly blunt album lyrically, but it came into focus here. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They Might Be Giants / "The Mesopotamians" - their goofiest and catchiest song since "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)" and that's saying something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Snatch up their terrific new albumfor kids Here Come The 1, 2, 3's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rent a kid if you don't have one and enjoy.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; White Rabbits / "The Plot" - A solid debut, especially if this brilliantly structured song is a sign of things to come.8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bjork / "Declare Independence" - Bonkers, of course, which we want from Bjork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her new album sort of plods along and suddenly she's squealing out, "Start your own currency! / Make yourown stamp!" and I think, Bjork! How are you!9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Fogerty / "I Can't Take It No More" - He's still got that voice and, bless him, he's still pissed about that "Fortunate Son."10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Pipettes / "Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me" - would be Spice Girls trio with Spector-like singles that pummel you into submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whew! Are you still here?

It is the only "American" music, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I've always been a lot more comfortable with rating jazz singers like Andy Bey, Dee DeeBridgewater and Abbey Lincoln than instrumental jazz like Terence Blanchard and HerbieHancock (here with a voal dominated album) and others. (All of them are on my list.) Someothers I listened to like Charles Tolliver &amp; His Big Band just didn't quite make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ibarely glanced at classical music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But please share: what were some of the best jazz albumsof the year? Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Oh and what about the musical? I think jazz and the musical are both considereduniquely American contributions to the art form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, since I'm British I'm notterribly concerned with what country lays claim to what genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All I care about isgood music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LenP See Profile I'm a Fan of LenP permalink Favorite Album:Fountains of Wayne (Traffic and Weather) Favorite single:Identity Theft (Nellie McKay from Obligatory Villagers) Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:09 PM on 02/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:06 AM on 02/09/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:06 PM on 02/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:10 PM on 02/11/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:55 PM on 02/08/2008Michael Giltz: Alternate Grammys: The Best CDs of 2007 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/alternate-grammys-the-be_b_85801.html [4/5/2009 7:55:14 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Soul Music Cd Download Your Favorite Soul Music Artists &amp; Songs. 100% Free &amp; Legal! www.MusicOfFaith.com</p>
