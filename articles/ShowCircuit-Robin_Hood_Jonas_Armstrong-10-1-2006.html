                <p>British TV star Jonas Armstrong dons the bow and quiver for this adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reinventing Robin The hero of Sherwood Forest rides again in a new BBe television series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Giltz WHEN LITTLE CHILDREN (especially those lucky enough to be around hors­ es) play make-believe, two games are constant: cowboys and Indians, and Robin Hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's one reason Robin Hood is always being reinvented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Errol Flynn's iconic 1938 film version is the standard, of course, but recent years have seen Sean Connery and Au­ drey Hepburn face old age in Robin and Marian (1976), Kevin Costner helplessly tackle a British accent in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and author Nancy Springer create a distaff teen version in her series of young adult novels that began with Outlaw Princess of Sherwood: A Tale Of Rowan Hood in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus it probably seemed like the most natural thing in the world for 25- year-old actor Jonas Armstrong to play one of the most famous heroes in histo­ ry for a new 13-part television series for the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slightly less natural was being whisked from a film location in India to Budapest, where a lavish set recreated 12th-century England so he could play the nobleman turned outlaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins airing in the United States on BBC America this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was one problem, however: Armstrong had never ridden a horse. "When he arrived in Hungary, he wasn't good enough yet;' admits Bela Unger, a Hungarian stunt man and the leader of "Hood Academy," the nick­ name of the two-week course in riding, swordplay, and other stunt work the ac­ tors went through before filming began. "Jonas is working with a very nice brown Hungarian horse called Pedro, who is very experienced and very knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knows what we need on a set;' notes Unger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly, Unger knows the faith he can place in the animals he works with is going to be well-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After six months of filming on the highly antici­ pated series (the casting of the new Robin Hood made headlines in the U.K.), Armstrong is grateful for the SHOW CIRCUIT ® FALL 2006 brusque, businesslike manner of his trainers. "You can't go into it a bit hesitant;' says Armstrong, best known for his per­ formance on the u.K. drama Teacher. "You've just got to fling yourself in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I landed in Budapest on a Sunday, and on a Monday I was up at the crack of dawn and I was introduced to Bela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't take any bullshit;' laughs the actor. "He said, 'OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is Pedro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is your horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knows everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On you get: There's no messing around here; there are no airs and graces with the Hungarians; just get on with it and do it." So Armstrong just got on with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His Robin Hood isn't the merry fellow who dashes about in green tights either. "He can be a very selfish character and arrogant," Armstrong observes of their modern take on Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hood. "He loves himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not with his hand on hips, saying, 'Ha ha, I'm a hero!' None of this, 'Maid Marian, I shall sweep you off your feet!' He can't be too selfish, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You do see him put his life on the line for others:' Armstrong had little time to prepare for the biggest break of his young career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although who wouldn't have fun play­ ing Robin Hood? That's as basic a thrill as it gets for any actor. "It is great fun;' admits Armstrong. "You do enjoy it when you're having the fights, because Robin is supposed to enjoy fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can't look like you're enjoying it too much because you're supposed to be thinking about a hundred things at the same time, so you can't be, 'A-ha! I'm fighting away!' I want a bit of menace." Happily, the equetsrian and other re­ quired skills weren't menacing to the star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riding came fairly easily and, like most theatrically trained actors, Arm­ strong was already well-grounded in swordplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But how handy is he with a bow and arrow? ''I'm OK," Armstrong responds with a smile. ''I'm good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm better than your av­ erage guy, but I wouldn't say I'm amaz­ ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank God the modern technology of TV can make me look fantastic." •</p>
