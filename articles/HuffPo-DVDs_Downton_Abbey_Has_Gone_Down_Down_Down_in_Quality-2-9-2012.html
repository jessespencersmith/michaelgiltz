Downton , I fear, is going to be with us for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LADY AND THE TRAMP ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- It's a knee jerk reaction to refer to every single Disney animated film as a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But right below the top-tier of Snow White and Pinocchio and others, you'll find the second tier of very good films that are charming and have stood the test of time --even if they're not stone cold masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In that group resides Lady and the Tramp , a sweet and charming tale bolstered by Peggy Lee's terrific songs and one of the most romantic kisses in screenhistory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder it's on the cover of this set, which looks great and features the strong extras that aDisney production deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Jackson's Shocking Tweets About Isaac Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' DRIVE ($39.99 BluRay; Sony) THE IDES OF MARCH ($35.99 BluRay; Columbia) -- Actor Ryan Gosling had the sort of year every savvy actor longs for when building a career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He co-starred in the popular romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love and garnered attention for both his abs and his comedic chops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he took the cool character study Drive to Cannes where it received tons of acclaim for critics, launching a pretty good box office run as well as Oscar talk for his co-star Albert Brooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wound it up with the political drama The Ides Of March, which did in fact garner an Oscar nomination for director George Clooney's screenplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Gosling needs now is an out-and-out hit (or better yet franchise he can call his own, a la Matt Damon's Bourne films) and he'll be able to continue making the smart, bold films he wants for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Island/Universal) THE RICHARD THOMPSON BAND: LIVE AT CELTIC CONNECTIONS ($19.98 BluRay; Eagle Rock) CHRIS ISAAK LIVE IN CONCERT/GREATEST HITS LIVE ($17.97 BluRay; Image) X: THE UNHEARD MUSIC ($16.95; Angel Media/MVD) TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS: LIVE IN CONCERT ($17.97 BluRay; Image) -- TheU2 documentary is a fine straightforward documentary that appeared in the lavish reissue of AchtungBaby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This edition is longer than that one, which seems pretty cruel if you forked over more than $100 for the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's a solid look at a turning point in the band's career, albeit strictly for fans of the band already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Thompson is a sterling live act and one of my all-time favorites, but this concert is for his album Dream Attic , which is not one of his best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the concert leans so heavily on it, this show is simply good and doesn't scale the peaks Thompson so often does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Isaak has quietly gone about amassing a chunk of great singles, but this awkward combination of two concerts contains three songsthat appear on both (a lot when the shows only include 11 or 12 tunes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's fun and in good voice butdeserves a better live document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike U2, the LA band X delivered a really memorable documentaryabout their group before calling it a day, though X: The Unheard Music has been overlooked for years, thanks to its lack of availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This fine new set with extras should remedy that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Tom Petty andthe Heartbreakers are a legendary live act, but like Springsteen, they've never been well captured on film.The same, sadly, is true here of this fine but unremarkable performance for Soundstage .A VERY HAROLD &amp; KUMAR CHRISTMAS ($35.99; Warner Bros.) -- Maybe it was the holiday season, but this third H&amp;K movie got closer to the sweet spirit of the original than the rather sour sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course there can never be enough of Neil Patrick Harris in self-mocking, lady-killer mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thoughthe 3-D was used extensively in theaters, for some odd reason it's just kind of dumbly amusing to see all sorts of things flying out at the camera even in 2-D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will there be a fourth? Of course there will be a fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WINGS ($29.99 BluRay; Paramount)TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD 50TH ANNIVERSARY ($26.98 BluRay; Universal) A STAR IS BORN 1937 ($29.95 BluRay; Kino) Wings was the last silent film (indeed the only silent film) to win the Oscar for Best Picture and it's also memorable for one of the great screen debuts -- Gary Cooper makes a tremendous impression in a small role as a doomed pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may soon be joined by the silent homage The Artist in that rare category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This nicely restored BuRay showcases the still fun if creaky movie and kicks off a series of Paramount restorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To Kill A Mockingbird is also beautifully presented by Universal, which makes sense for one of the films that truly deserves the word beloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like it better than the book but have never been crazy about either (it's usually good to keep that to yourself on a first date; I can't tell you how often people say, "But that's my favorite book!") And A Star Is Born is always ripe for remake, but the Janet Gaynor and Frederick March edition is too often overshadowed by the Judy Garland and James Mason take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thissharp-looking restoration is good though the all-but absent extras are not up to standard for a movie with this strong of a history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON ($54.99 3-D BluRay combo; Paramount) REAL STEEL ($39.99 BluRay; Touchstone/Disney) -- Why Transformers continues to make loads of money is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I understand fans turning out for the original and then seeing the sequel with hopes it might be better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But surely by the time of this third edition, it's clear the noisiest and dumbestfranchise around can't be bothered to do anything but smash things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 3-D was pointless inthe theater, frankly and it might even be marginally less tiresome to watch the movie on 2-D at homethan with the glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't however make the movie any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Real Steel at least bothered to come up with a plot, albeit a hackneyed one about a dad finding common ground with his estranged sonby building and fighting robot boxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugh Jackman has terrible taste in scripts (or needs a managerwho does).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To go from this to appearing on Broadway where he can sing "Stepping Out" and then begreeted by literally thousands of adoring fans afterwards...well, it's a miracle if he ever makes a movie again.SID &amp; NANCY ($24.99 BluRay; MGM/Fox) GOOD MORNING VIETNAM ($19.99 BluRay; Touchstone/Disney) DEAD POETS SOCIETY ($19.99 BluRay; Touchstone/Disney) SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE ($14.99 BluRay; Miramax) -- First let me note the happy fact of falling prices for BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never thought they should have been priced a penny more than DVDs and it's nice tosee classic titles coming out at $15 and $20 price points, with sale prices even lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gary Oldman wouldbe my pick for best actor this year for his work on Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's been wowing us for decades, including his marvelously unhinged immersion into the role of Sid Vicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Williams toreit up in the uneven Good Morning Vietnam but wisely got out-of-the-way in Dead Poets and ceded the stage to the talented young students led by Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Shakespeare In Love is often seen as lighter fare that robbed Saving Private Ryan of its Best Picture Oscar, but it's a fun romp and holds up quite nicely thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL ($39.98 BluRay; Universal) -- In a few days, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom will celebrate its 10,000th performance on Broadway and has just passed its 25th anniversary in existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This lavish one-time staging at the Royal Albert Hall is a live performance starring Ramin karimloo and Sierra Boggess for broadcast around the world. it avoids the sterility of the Joel Schumacher film and adds a little oomph to a show so many people have seen in person already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll take the music of Cats, Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar over this, but virtually everyone else in the world seems to disagree with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like it, this is a fine live version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POIROT SERIES 1 ($49.99 BluRay; Acorn) STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION: THE NEXT LEVEL ($22.99 BluRay; Paramount) -- I've seen David Suchet's definitive performance as Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, but I was not there at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I'm very excited to begin this series at the beginning and follow him all the way through fromthe first mystery they broadcast ("The Adventure Of The Clapham Cook") right down to the finalwhatever (Suchet is determined to film every single Poirot tale, whatever its origin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think Poirotfans are obsessed with picture quality, but the BluRay looks very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a pity they couldn't have putout a massive boxed set with, say, half of the entire run in chronological order in one place, rather thandribbling out these season by season releases for a show that has been on so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can't haveeverything...unless you're a Star Trek fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paramount is determined to give you what you want and surely those fans do care about hi-def.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This teaser set contains three episodes from ST: TNG converted intohigh-definition and the results are pretty stunning as far as the level of detail now visible. it's sure to get fans chomping at the bit for the BluRay released of the entire series after such careful remastering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MOMENT OF TRUTH ($29.99 BluRay; Criterion) THREE POPULAR FILMS BY JEAN-PIERRE GORIN ($44.95; Eclipse/Criterion) -- I've never enjoyed my homework more than now when it comes from Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When other labels reissue movies, it's usually films I've seen like Shakespeare In Love and To Kill A Mockingbird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Criterion reissues a movie, it's sometimes a movie I'm completely unfamiliar with but am certain to find fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait to get to the bullfighting drama The Moment Of Truth , by Italian director Francesco Rosi, starring real-life matador Migeulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can only assume that Hemingway loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And from their marvelous Eclipse series comes three documentaries by Gorin that focus on twin sisters, model train enthusiasts and a Samoan street gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All from the 1980s and all of which are completely new to me -- for any other label, that might be concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Criterion takes the time to put it out, it's certain to be worth your time too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Williams As Dwight D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eisenhower In...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid... '2016: Obama's America' Fact- Check Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTORIOUS REBECCA SPELLBOUND MANHATTANANNIE HALLTHE APARTMENT ($24.99 each on BluRay; MGM) -- I've reviewed a string of old movies that were reissued in the last few weeks -- To Kill A Mockingbird, A Star Is Born, Wings and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've casually mentioned that they look good to great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's easy to take for granted the work and expense that needs togo into those releases so they do look good...but not when you're faced with lazy work done here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisbatch of six titles from the MGM library are all on BluRay and trust me, these are not restorations oreven remasterings but just whatever print was available slapped onto Bluray and then given the insultingtagline "The Ultimate high-Definition Experience." Uh, hardly, not when my years-old DVDs lookvirtually the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The beginning of Woody Allen's Manhattan is one of the most famed openers in film history and should stun you with its lavish black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here it looks grainy and ugly, as if smog hasdescended on New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all these years, you'd think they'd want to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true with every other film here; they are at best no better than the most recent DVD releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's puzzling to say the least since by now studios realize the value in their film libraries and few directors are more popular than Alfred Hitchcock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here he have one of his best ( Notorious ), one of his worst ( Spellbound ) and a work-for-hire that won Best Picture ( Rebecca ) all delivered with indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto Woody Allen's Manhattan and Annie Hall, as well as Billy Wilder's coruscating The Apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would have two or three of these six films on my all-time best list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you already own them, there's no reason to buy these BluRays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you don't own them, buy a used or new DVD at a cheaper price and wait until they do it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST TITLES LISTED HERE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE FORMATS AND IN MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING DVD, BLURAY, DIGITAL DOWNLOAD, VOD, STREAMING AND THELIKE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE FORMAT LISTED IS THE FORMAT PROVIDED FOR REVIEW, NOT ALL THE FORMATSAVAILABLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT IS OFTEN THE MOST EXPENSIVE VERSION WITH THE MOST EXTRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DO CHECKINDIVIDUAL TITLES FOR AVAILABILITY IN ALL THEIR VARIOUS GUISES AND PRICE POINTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and BluRays with the understanding that he would be considering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does not guarantee to review and he receives farmore titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program 04:38 PM on 02/14/2012 Time to revive "The Pallisers"! 12:24 AM on 02/14/2012 Agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DOWNTOWN started off well last season, except for the MINIVER plagiarism, but this season has been cheap soap opera clichÃ©.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am surprised that the same writer who gave us GOSFORD PARK has stooped to this. 10:33 AM on 02/13/2012 Nice to see a mention of "The Unheard Music" but I have to inform you that ~X~ have not called it a day - they've been on tour pretty much constantly since last year, including a trip to South Americaopening for Pearl Jam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just haven't recorded new music since the 90s - but thanks for the mention of a truly great documentary of a truly great band. 10:11 AM on 02/11/2012 Thanks for mentioning Poldark which stands up pretty well despite being made 35 years earlier! Since it was based on Winton Graham's novels, the character development was carefully thoughtthrough! In those days they didn't use music to tell you want to think all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was shot with multi-cameras too, so they performed it like a play which gives each scene a driving energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poldark fans might like to know that the star, Robin Ellis, is also a blogger, focused on life in rural France, cooking and healthy eating--especially for people with Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His approach is theopposite of Paula Deen's. http://robin-ellis.net/ You can fine him on Facebook too. 12:39 AM on 02/11/2012 I only read the part about Downton Abbey, and i will just say this: Upstairs Downstairs was fairlyengaging at the time it came out, but the production values are so outdated it is very hard to watchat this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The downstairs was far more interesting than the upstairs in that series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downton Abbey's plot is good enough to keep it going, however derivative, but it is the delightfulness of the characters, both up and down , as well as the beauty of the place, the artdirection, the costumes, the props! that make it fully engaging to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is GORGEOUS!!!

Master Piece Theater is delivering a series that beats everything on TV imo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait for the 3rd season with Shirley McClain. 12:40 PM on 02/10/2012 We have really enjoyed watching Downton Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is just too classy for the people that like all thereality tv shows that we have on TV today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are some TV shows that are plain boring to watch.This just proves that there is a generation gap when it comes to what is considered qualityTelevision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Americans will fight to keep their quality PBS TV shows! Whether they like it or not! 03:40 AM on 02/10/2012 DOWNTON ABBEY is still quality television with exceptional actors/characters that continue to beabsorbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am thoroughly thrilled that there will be a third season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ah, critics - they can't do it butthey can sure knock it. 04:38 AM on 02/10/2012 Hi Gloria, thanks for commenting; you're certainly one of many who is enjoying the showand glad for a third season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd much rather hear your defense of the show rather than thetired old complaint that anyone who criticizes anything is just a whiny critic who can't actually write a novel/make a movie/record an album, etc. it is indeed a talented cast, but the plot twists are so absurd now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPOILER through last week's episode seven: Matthewhas gone from being paralyzed to feeling a twinge to leaping to his feet and dancing inabout three episodes, Edith falls in love with her third man and even though he's supposedto be the long-lost and presumed dead fiance of Mary, as far as I can tell Mary doesn'teven exchange a single private word with him but vehemently denies he could be that manand on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just became too daytime soapy for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have you ever seen the original Upstairs, Downstairs? The first season is a little slow, but it's ultimately a great series you might like as well. 08:59 AM on 02/10/2012 So what if......

His one-time pal and secret arch enemy Andy (Aaron Ramey) who throws a spanner in the works, hoping to win acclaim for himself and woo away Rob's wife Jackie (Michelle Federer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may not be so hard -- in one of the show's best numbers, she complains that Rob's fixation on pools leaves her feeling "Second Best." This sounds too dumb for words, until people start singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musicals can make even oddball ideas like this one...well, sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jaunty opener sets the mood quickly, Rob's "What More Do I Need" is catchy ina Billy Joel manner (Cincotti isn't afraid of a catchy melody like so many theater composers), "If SheWere Mine" deftly lets us know Andy's simmering resentment and before you know it you're caught up inMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) GOP Approves Abortion Ban PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the SilentFOLLOW USAround Town Restaurants Real Estate NY Impact Best of New York NYPD Scandals Parties MTA WTC August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA STYLE FOOD TECH ARTS GAY VOICES LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Bobby BowdenHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 07/24/2012 7:55 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyRecommend 258 Like 7k Recommend 678 Like 7k Like 45 Like 475 Like 3k Recommend 8k Like 1kFunny Videos Meditation Unplug And Recharge Log in Create Accountthe tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other highlights include "With That Kind Of Money," "Time For Andy," and "Handyman From Heaven." That's a lot of highlights for any show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with those strong melodies, the strength of this show is the excellent cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leviton does a great job with the regular Joe Rob and Federer is believable as his no-nonsense wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She gets frustrated at hisoccasional dimness but gosh she loves the lug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not so easy to get across, but Federer does it easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of all is Ramey as the scheming Andy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His excellent voice and Tool Time persona make him perfectfor the frustrated friend of Rob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramey wisely never overplays the villainy, which roots the whole silly venture in a realistic vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the supporting players are fun in their various roles, from Amanda Brutonas a pal of Jackie to Joseph Ryan Harrington as the Kid to Anthony Festa , who makes you wish the beach were always open for swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edward Pierce does a good job with the scenic design, though the pool represented by a rod with hanging down algae is a minor disappointment. (Surely something more imaginative could be created.)Choreographer Wendy Seyb keeps her not so limber cast moving nicely and directors Jeremy Dobrish and Gina Rattan oversee it all with keep-it-moving economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the areas that need work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rob sings about 17 odes to the joys of chlorine when really we only needed one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto the flashbacks to childhood where Rob is constantly playing with chlorine; he's constantly being yelled at and told there's not future in chlorine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We get it; he's crazy about pool cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The requiems for a whale which are interspersed are meant to underline the pollution in the ocean I guess, but they feel out of place and slow the action down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A key flashback is botched: we see Rob and Andy back when they were partners in the pool cleaning business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About the only essential idea we've learned about Rob is that he's a sweetheart and lovescleaning pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in the flashback suddenly he's lazy on the job (and not because he's caught up in the raptures of chlorine) and even seems to take credit when Andy deserves it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not much of a team player and we can understand why Andy resents him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's surely not the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far better ifwe saw Andy shirking his duties and taking advantage of Rob even back then without Rob actuallyknowing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeing Rob still get the girl and credit for his skills would be the festering sore for Andy, not a genuine resentment of a slob who didn't do his fair share of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That just throws the show out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even worse is the flashback that shows Rob responsible for the death of his mother presumably because he over-chlorinated the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I kept waiting for another flashback where we'd find out the youthful Andywas actually responsible (unintentionally, I imagined).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no, Rob killed his mom? Huh? This feelswildly out of place in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That might create a problem for the song where the ghost of Rob's mom comes back in the form of a black woman to sing him a clue to his conundrum over how to properly chlorinate the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not really -- just have his wife prepare him some food so Rob can complain his late mother made it better. "Well, let her make it for you then" she cam complain loudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This could add to their friction and poof, you've got a dream sequence ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd also add an earlier hint of Rob'saffection for a certain sitcom to make a late show surprise (quite a fun one) not seem so far out of leftfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a celeb's not available down the road, let the actress playing his mom play him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So straightening out the back story, focusing the tension between Rob and Andy, cutting the grisly fact of Rob's matricide, removing the whale funeral music, and letting just one or two references to chlorinestand in for the hundreds already filling the show and you've got yourself a breezy silly show with great roles for non-traditional leads (ie. guys who ain't so young or pretty anymore).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping that the Cincottis have caught the musical theater bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CENTRAL AVENUE BREAKDOWN *** SIGNATURE THEATRE This is the return of Central Avenue Breakdown , which I first saw at NYMF in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's my original review.The story remains the same: a family moves to Los Angeles with the dream of seeing dad William make it big on the jazz scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a painful scene that's more subtle and effective this time around, we realize he's just outclassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't stop the dream however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William starts teaching music to locals and passes on his passion to his sons, the dutiful Bill and the fiery and more talented Jim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill is soon workingsteadily as a sideman in swing bands (good enough to get called up to the big time and join DukeEllington) while Jim is drawn to bebop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't want people to dance to his music, he wants them to sit and listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when they don't (at first) it drives him to despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in a beautiful Hollywood movie star who can swing a tune like Anita O'Day for a love triangle and the racial prejudice of LA cops in thatera for some simmering violence and you've got yourself a show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This updated version directed and choreographed again by Christopher Windom is more focused and successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've tossed out an unnecessary framing device and made clearer the romance between the movie star Jane and Bill, making her affair with Jim all the more painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish Rebecca LaChance had been given more motivation for that betrayal that she and Jim indulge in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But overall, her character andTreatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESYun Zi's 3rd Birthday Party PATH Command Center Tour How to Ride the Subway NYPD Bullets Wounded All Nine In Empire State Building Shooting MAP: The GOP In NYC The 'Dumbest Drug Law' In The Country?

(She was always aces with her act two number "UnnaturalAttraction.") Albert Christmas and Stacey Sargeant are world weary but unbowed as the parents while Juson Williams is having a blast and serves as the master of ceremony as the exuberant Thaddeus Clemons III, the owner of LA's coolest jazz club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two brothers are very charismatic as portrayed by Joshua Boone as Bill and Rod Lawrence as Jim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's clearer now in this production that Bill has talent and confidence of his own, even though jim is thegenius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes their brotherly back and forth more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawrence is also subtler with thedescent into addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are two very tricky, rewarding parts with the actors called on to belt outsome numbers and swing through pages of dialogue at other points in some very ambitious tunes by Kevin Ray. (The book is by Ray &amp; Andrea Lepcio, with additional story by Suellen Vance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lepcio's contributions have sharpened things up nicely.) Both actors are stronger in the dramatic scenes thansome of the exceptionally difficult tunes they have to navigate, but both also shine at certain points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Central Avenue Breakdown still feels a little too schematic in its good brother/brother gone astray tale with heroin addiction and an upbeat finale colliding rather abruptly at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the strong cast, swinging band and some terrific tunes, it convincingly gives a glimpse into the jazz world of LA back inthe day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work they've put into it has paid off with a more satisfying evening of theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may not be ready to jump to Broadway, but at times it does jump and jive and that's an accomplishment indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
