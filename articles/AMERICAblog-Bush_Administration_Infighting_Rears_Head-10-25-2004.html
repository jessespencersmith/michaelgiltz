"We think it guarantees that we'll have the kind oftreatment of these individuals that we believe they deserve," saidVice President Dick Cheney, who was a driving force behind thepolicy."But three years later, not a single terrorist has been prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ofthe roughly 560 men being held at the United States naval base atGuantánamo Bay, Cuba, only 4 have been formally charged.Preliminary hearings for those suspects brought such a barrage ofprocedural challenges and public criticism that verdicts could still bemonths away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since a Supreme Court decision in June that gavethe detainees the right to challenge their imprisonment in federalcourt, the Pentagon has stepped up efforts to send home hundreds ofmen whom it once branded as dangerous terrorists."Here's part two, another massive but engrossing article that nailsdown that the worst of the worst held in extraordinary circumstancesat Guantanamo are mostly low-level nothings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, more infighting!"Although White House lawyers said they rushed to devise a newjudicial structure that could handle serious Qaeda terrorists, many ofthe detainees sent to Guantánamo turned out to be low-levelmilitants, Taliban fighters and men simply caught in the wrong placeat the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Pentagon's efforts to gather intelligence frommore valuable prisoners were also deeply flawed, military intelligenceofficers said, complicating the prosecution of some detainees andnearly paralyzing efforts to release others."Interviews with dozens of officials show that the myriad problemsignited an often fierce behind-the-scenes struggle that set thePentagon and its allies in the White House against adversaries at theNational Security Council, the State Department and JusticeDepartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The friction among officials like Defense SecretaryDonald H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rumsfeld; the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice;and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ashcroft sheds new light on the internal dynamics of anadministration that has shown a remarkably united public front."
