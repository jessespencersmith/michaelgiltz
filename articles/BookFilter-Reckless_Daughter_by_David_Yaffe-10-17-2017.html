Genius makes its own rules, even if that doesn't excuse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allthat said, the book is dutiful more than fun, if only because her private life wasn't so much fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without ever reducingsongs to certain people and places and times (be it David Geffen's inspiration on "Free Man In Paris" or Mitchell inspiringCrosby, Stills, Nash and Young's "Our House"), Yaffe details the real-life context to songs that have long since transcended "Oh, that was about the time I fought with..." to become classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As an ardent fan, I enjoyed the seriousness of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I doubt a better biography will come along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unlike Dylan's memoir (which stands outside his music as its ownstrange thing) or Springsteen's confessional (which informs our appreciation of his music, especially the early years) thisbook is a good addendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It adds zest to the list of musicians who played on her albums since we appreciate more fully who they are and how they served Mitchell's vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But her real testament remains the music and happily this book sends you back to album after album, realizing anew what an amazing body of work she has produced. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Joni Mitchell’s gift was so enormous that it remade the social space around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As David Yaffe’s new biography, “Reckless Daughter: A Portrait of Joni Mitchell” (Sarah Crichton Books), suggests, it is no small burdento possess something as valuable as Mitchell’s talent, and it meant that this girl from the Canadian prairie would be in the world, whether she liked it or not . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yaffe, who teaches at Syracuse, charts these encounters with a sure hand, and is a brilliant analyst of how Mitchell’s songs are made. " ―Dan Chiasson, The New Yorker "Dazzling . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A shimmering portrait of one artist's life, illusions and all." ―Booklist (starred review) "The essential biography of Joni Mitchell." ―Now Toronto “Reckless Daughter is a bewitched, bothered, andbewildered portrayal of one of the most beautiful and enigmatic artists of a beautiful and enigmatic period ofAmerican life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is touching, mystifying, and revealing in equal parts.” ―Mary Gaitskill “Joni Mitchell, an artistof innervating and daunting complexity, originality, and importance, could have no better biographer than DavidYaffe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knows the music like the serious musician he is, knows the poetry like the literary scholar he is, and is equally attuned to Mitchell’s tortured soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On top of all that, he seems to have interviewed everyone important in Mitchell’s life, from her first husband to Leonard Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reckless Daughter is nothing less than the definitivestatement on the life and work of an artist who defies definition.” ―David Hajdu, author of Love for Sale: PopMusic in America “It’s so easy to get Joni Mitchell wrong, or to leave out the most important things, or to missthe point altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reckless Daughter is the definitive correction to all the errors, a sharp yet sprawling lookat one of the most brilliant musical artists of modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Yaffe grasps the nuances―of the music, thepoetry, the intellect, the madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gets it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gets her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn’t get enough of this fine biography.”―Meghan Daum, author of The Unspeakable: And Other Subjects of Discussion “David Yaffe is an artful andincisive critic who writes with such grace and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Reckless Daughter, he makes a figure as iconic as Joni Mitchell feel wholly new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This portrait is loaded with revelations, both spiritual and actual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought I understood something about Mitchell―the way her tough and tender songs move, her sweetness andrebellion―but Yaffe understands everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a book.” ―Amanda Petrusich, author of Do Not Sell at AnyPrice: The Wild, Obsessive Hunt for the World’s Rarest 78rpm Records What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
