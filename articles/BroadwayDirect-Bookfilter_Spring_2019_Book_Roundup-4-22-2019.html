Here are the hot-off-the-press theater books we nominate as worthy of yourtime this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Streisand: An Opinionated Guide BOOKFILTER’S SPRING PICKS FOR THEATER LOVERS MICHAEL GILTZ | APRIL 22, 2019 SHARE By Ethan Mordden $21.95, Oxford University Press Barbra Streisand has never won a Tony! She’s been nominated twice and been honored with a special Tony, but she’s never snagged a competitive statue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Streisand was among thenominees twice: once for her breakthrough work in I Can Get It for You Wholesale, and a second time, of course, for Funny Girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Streisand’s lifelong love of musical theater andlandmark recordings make her a Broadway baby, we can only hope those competitive juices willconvince her to return to Broadway someday. (Why not? It worked for Bette Midler!) And criticand historian Ethan Mordden agrees she’s one of the greats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His impassioned book looks atStreisand’s artistry and importance from every possible angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He delves into the albums, themovies, the TV specials, and her early work in cabaret and theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His book is subtitled AnOpinionated Guide, and opinionated ain’t the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You start reading but Mordden is already galloping far, far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s so informed and enthusiastic and defensive and wide-ranging inhis claims for Streisand’s talent, artistry, legacy, impact, and all-around greatness that it’s apleasure just trying to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust ExerciseBy Susan Choi $27, Henry Holt and Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The young people who watch the Tonys and listen to cast recordings and obsess over their favorite shows? If they’re lucky, they have the talent to attend a performing arts school anddevote every waking moment to what they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s the setting of Pulitzer Prize nomineeSusan Choi’s latest novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Students Sarah and David fall under the spell of each other and theirmagnetic acting teacher, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kingsley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s the Reagan era, and Sarah is the Molly Ringwaldcharacter, a poor-ish student with a white-knight boyfriend in David, who is almostembarrassingly wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That difference hardly matters when Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kingsley turns the lights off inthe classroom and students crawl over and around each other with uncontained sensual glee.Sarah and David outpace the rest, not by having sex (no great marker in this world) but by theintensity of their unstable attraction/repulsion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Choi toys with our trust but it pays off in dividends.Certainly, fans of theater and serious fiction will relish how frustrating and rewarding and life-changing a drama class can be for adolescents, even if the closest they ultimately get to thebright lights of Broadway is a seat in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read more: Broadway Direct April Pick of the Month What Blest Genius?: The Jubilee That Made ShakespeareBy Andrew McConnell Stott $26.95, W.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norton and Company Even the greats need a boost to maintain the fame they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a little late to honor William Shakespeare with an honorary Tony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But back in 1769, the next best thing happened: Stratford-Upon-Avon held a festival to honor its most famous son and cement his legacy in the process.Author Andrew McConnell Stott tackles this near-disaster of an event in great detail, from theprice-gouging inns to the wary locals and the intelligentsia who came to sniff at such a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heoffers pocket portraits of all involved, namely actor David Garrick, whose career revolved aroundpromoting Shakespeare, and James Boswell, who knew a good party when he saw one andcaptured everything in precise detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endless rain, endless tributary poems, and endlesscrowds converged to praise and elevate the Bard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genius, on the part of Shakespeare, andperhaps luck on the part of the organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The InheritanceBy Matthew Lopez $19.95, Faber &amp; Faber The Tonys cap the theater season, coming on the heels of the U.K.’s Oliviers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At that theater- awards event, the big winner was the epic play The Inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you thought one massive six- hour show about AIDS in New York City was enough, well, think again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matthew Lopez’suniversally acclaimed drama used E.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forster’s novel Howards End for inspiration, cast the great Vanessa Redgrave in a key role (who needs an angel when you’ve got her?), and swepteveryone in its path with the play’s sheer ambition, heart, passion, and heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you can’t wait forit to come to Broadway (and how could you?), you can start to connect with it right now byreading Lopez’s play and using your imagination to cast, mount, and stage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Degas, Painter of BallerinasBy Susan Goldman Rubin $19.99, Abrams Books for Young Readers This delightful art book for preteens is a great way to introduce kids to two beautiful worlds: the world of classical dance and the world of classical art, typified by Edgar Degas’s studies ofballerinas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Made in collaboration with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it includes a briefbiography of the artist and gorgeous reproductions of these beloved paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ideal readingbefore a child’s first trip to the museum or the ballet — and just as ideal when they want to reliveit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Assassin of Verona By Benet Brandreth $25.95, Pegasus Books Why should Christopher Marlowe have all the fun? In the latest thriller starring a young Will Shakespeare, our playwright in the making also has the makings of a spy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest in theseries finds Shakespeare disguised as a steward to the English ambassador and in possessionof the names of English Catholics plotting against Queen Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deadly assassins sent bythe Pope are tracking him down, so Will and his actor friends flee, paraphrasing famousShakespearean lines and stumbling across incidents that would inspire scenes in his plays foryears to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too Much Is Not Enough By Andrew Rannells $26, Crown Archetype Only a few, a happy few, ever experience what actor Andrew Rannels has experienced: starring in a white-hot Tony-winning Broadway smash like The Book of Mormon that makes history and makes you a star in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you met him, how could you not ask what it was like? Orabout his role on the Lena Dunham HBO comedy Girls? Or a thousand other details of his verypublic life? But the best stories happen before someone becomes a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rannells offers up justthat with this memoir about the sexually confused kid who left Nebraska and came to New YorkCity to follow his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heartbreak, romance, coming out, losing his dad, and climaxing withhis Broadway debut in Hairspray — it’s all here and certain to inspire anyone daring themselves to take that chance of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Honey &amp; Leon Take the High Road By Alan Cumming (words) and Grant Shaffer (illustrations) $17.99, Random House Books for Young Readers Tony winner Alan Cumming knows how to share a stage — but sharing his life with two rescue mutts is more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Especially when said dogs, Honey and Leon, won’t leave him alone.Cumming and his husband, Grant Shaffer, head to Scotland for a vacation, but Honey and Leonworry the two don’t know how to take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this sequel to their first picture bookadventure, Honey and Leon don disguises, trace the footsteps of their beloved friends, fall inlove (well, at least Honey does), and somehow hope to make it back home without beingdiscovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cumming does the words, Shaffer does the illustrations, but Honey and Leon arethe stars here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drag: Combing Through the Big Wigs of Show BusinessBy Frank Decaro $35, Rizzoli Just as Broadway says goodbye to Kinky Boots, it says hello to the Tony hopeful Tootsie .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the term drag may change in import and meaning over the years, men dressing as women and women dressing as men and people dressing as their own true selves (or discovering themalong the way) are as old as drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Shakespeare knew a thing or two about the fun ofcross-dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here is Frank Decaro to look at drag throughout showbiz, from greats suchas Divine to tourists like Katherine Hepburn and Dustin Hoffman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Genre-hoppers like TheAdventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Victor/Victoria (films turned stage musicals) are covered alongside Milton Berle, right up to RuPaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great images feature the likes of everyonefrom Lypsinka to Harvey Fierstein, from Hedda Lettuce to Charles Busch, as Decaro celebratesmore than 100 years of drag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mama’s Boy: A Story From Our AmericaBy Dustin Lance Black $27.95, Knopf You may think of Dustin Lance Black as the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Milk .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he found his first home in the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his memoir, Black describes growing up gay and Mormon, finding refuge during high school in places like The Western Stage and shows like Bare .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In college, he apprenticed with stage directors, worked on lighting, and he even acted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When theantigay Proposition 8 gained ground in California, he took to the barricades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a long battleled to the ballot measure being overturned in the courts, Black looked to the theater again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewrote the play 8 to bring that legal fight to life since the courts refused to release any video recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drawing on trial transcripts and interviews with the people involved, it debuted inNew York City and was broadcast to the world on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now married to Olympic diver TomDaley, Black’s story revolves around his mother, a woman abandoned by her first husband andfighting the ravages of polio while struggling to reconcile her deeply conservative faith with theman her son has become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it just us, or would their story make a great play? Oscar Wilde and the Return of Jack the RipperBy Gyles Brandreth $25.95, Pegasus You might think artists like Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde would be too busy to fight crime, but you would be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The seventh Oscar Wilde mystery pairs that legendary wit with his sidekick,Arthur Conan Doyle, as they face the horrifying possibility that Jack the Ripper is back in actionand ready to make fools of law enforcement yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, Oscar Wilde was anything but afool, so you can be certain he’ll have something to say about that, probably something pithy.Fans of the series will be relieved Gyles Brandreth has revived this franchise after a seven-yearbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadway Investing 101By Ken Davenport $9.99, Amazon Digital Services Well, yes, everyone wishes they had invested in Hamilton .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, what you really wanted to do was invest in the musical In the Heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new Broadway-bound show by a talent who had yet to break through? That’s where you can help work be mounted, get tickets to the Tony Awards, and be this close to the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, and perhaps make a financial killing in the process. (You’re not going to get good terms as an investor when putting your money onestablished artists.) Ken Davenport has been there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s been involved with everything fromAlan Cumming’s one-man Macbeth, Kinky Boots, and the just-closed comedy hit The Play That Goes Wrong, to Off-Broadway’s Altar Boyz and the gorgeous Theater Deaf West revival of Spring Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His ebook guide to investing offers up tips to newbies and veterans alike, demolishing some myths and pointing the way forward for those who have money to lose on agamble and prefer to gamble with something they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s more fun than betting on black atthe roulette wheel — and lasts longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macbeth: A Dagger of the MindBy Harold Bloom $24, Scribner Speaking of Macbeth, who better than critic Harold Bloom to illuminate one of the greatest villains in all of theater?
