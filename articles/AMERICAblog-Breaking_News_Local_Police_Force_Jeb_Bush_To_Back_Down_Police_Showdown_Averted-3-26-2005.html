Local Police Force Jeb Bush ToBack Down: Police Showdown Avertedby Michael in New York on 3/26/2005 01:12:00 AMWow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WOW! This is literally out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Miami Heraldhas numerous sources confirming that Jeb Bush was sending inthe troops -- ignoring the rule of law, the Supreme Court andthe opinion of the vast majority of Americans -- to in effectdelcare martial law and seize Terri Schiavo. (Thanks to bloggerAndrew A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gill for the heads-up on this one.)Think about this.Top far-right religious leaders told Jeb Bush he shouldn't bepushed around by some "piddling judge." Anne Coulter shoutedthey should send in the National Guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silly talk-radio/FoxNews rhetoric? Jeb Bush damn near did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if the bravemen and women of the local police hadn't decided to upholdthe law, Bush would have succeeded."Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavowas not to be removed from her hospice, a teamof state agents were en route to seize her andhave her feeding tube reinserted -- but theystopped short when local police told them theywould enforce the judge's order, The Herald haslearned," reports the Miami Herald."Agents of the Florida Department of LawEnforcement told police in Pinellas Park, the smalltown where Schiavo lies at Hospice Woodside, onThursday that they were on the way to take herto a hospital to resume her feeding."For a brief period, local police, who have officersat the hospice to keep protesters out, preparedfor what sources called ``a showdown.''"In the end, the squad from the FDLE and theDepartment of Children &amp; Families backed down,apparently concerned about confronting localpolice outside the hospice," all per the MiamiHerald's ground-breaking coverage.Do we live in some pathetic dictatorship now wherejudges who don't "cooperate" are threatened and theirfamilies are murdered and the rule of law is a joke?This has nothing to do anymore with what decisions youor I or anyone make at the end of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This has todo with a far-right minority deciding they want todismantle our form of government, attack theindependent judiciary until it is weak, and encourage agovernor to send in the troops.This is outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mere fact that Jeb Bush couldeven CONSIDER such a move is outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There needto be Congressional hearings, Bush needs to be censuredby the Congress if this proves accurate and a respect forthis country's laws needs to be instilled again in ourpeople.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't even mob rule, since most Americans HuffPost PoliticsThe Wrong Reporter Asks Obama A Question - Thechance to ask a question during a prime-timepresidential press conference is treasured realestate in the world of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when thePresident...6 minutes ago Daily KosIOKIYAPI (It's OK If You're A Private Insurer) -Here's William Kristol revealing the *horrors*hidden within the health care bill as it emergedfrom the HELP committee...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Kennedy and hisco-autho...19 minutes ago Ben SmithObama: Cambridge police acted 'stupidly' - Afterspending most of an hour patiently reiterating hisarguments for changing the health insurancesystem, President Barack Obama turned his press26 minutes ago Paul KrugmanProfessor in chief - I found Obama's health carepresentation so impressive - so much command ofthe issues - that it had me worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I really like apoliticians' speech, is...46 minutes ago EschatonObama Speaks - In Case You Missed It55 minutes agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Breaki...http://www.americablog.com/2005/03/breaking-news-local-poli... 1 of 57/22/09 10:38 PMShow AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Visit our AMERICAblog TV site.see all 322 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod In honor of SenatorDeMint For the GOPers, healthcare is politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just Traditional media has todebunk the birthers One small step...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The right-wing media, thevoices of the GOP, in REM - Orange CrushNext 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Breaki...http://www.americablog.com/2005/03/breaking-news-local-poli... 2 of 57/22/09 10:38 PMEzra KleinTab Dump3 hours agoWonk RoomSen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Byron Dorgan:The ‘Trade’ InCap-And-Trade ‘MakesNo Sense To Me’4 hours agoHealth BeatTruth Squad: WallStreet Journal HealthCare Editorial Wrong onthe Facts . . .5 hours agoThe TreatmentHatch Is Out6 hours agoDaily DoseProviders Endorse 'Payfor Value' Proposals12 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
