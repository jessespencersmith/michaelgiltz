(Nocomplications, I'm happy to say!) Though I haven't seen this book since I was 10 or 12, I immediately remembered the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George swallows a piece of a jigsaw puzzle and is soon causing mischief at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He clambers around, wakes up woozy from his minor operation and has no interest in anything but sleeping or scooting down the hall in a run-awaywheelchair. (The wheelchair is called a go-cart; that's how long ago this was written).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The illustrations are a treat whileShare This Book About The Author H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rey, Margret Rey MoreHans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city's famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After serving in the army during World War I, he married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The manuscript for the first … Release Info List Price: $17.99 (Hardcover) Published: March 07, 2017 Publisher: HMH Books for Young Readers Pages: 56 ISBN 10: 0544764080 ISBN 13: 9780544764088the text is not quite its equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Reys rescue it with the unexplained figure of Betsy, a little girl also at the hospital who is very sad and very scared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only at the finale -- when George gets into more trouble -- do we finally see her really and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where is her family? What is she there for? Will she get better? The book's willingness to leave these questions unanswered and their simple but effective way of tying up the pieces of the story at the end make this tale an enduringone, even after 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actor John Krazinski does an enthusiastic reading on the audio CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's geared towards very smallchildren and a bit over-emphatic, but fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the jaunty if bland score that's included means Krazinski's performancelasts 18 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone reading along will soon grow impatient at the draggy pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the audiobook is best appreciated on its own, perhaps in a car ride -- and hopefully not a car ride on the way to the hospital. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "While beginning readers are convinced that they are enjoying themselves with George, their supervising adults are equally sure that they are learning something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are absolutely right."
