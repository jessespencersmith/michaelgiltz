                <p>NYP TV WEEK • REALLY BIG SHOW Mackey gets'a lady boss By MICHAEL GILTZ THE third season of "The Shield" gets off to a grisly start this Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members of the Armenian mob in Los Angeles are seen chopping off the feet of their enemies as they viciously track down the people who robbed them of a massive pile of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rogue cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his pals pulled off that neat heist during last sea­ son's finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Mackey and his cohorts have to keep their noses relatively clean until the heat dies down, but the dirty cop is squarely in the sightlines of his new boss -the newly promoted Detective Clau­ dette Wyrns (C.C.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pounder). "Vic is trying to lay low and tame some of his more brutal cop tactics to keep off the police radar," says series creator Shawn Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season two of "The Shield" saw Vic and Claudette clash repeatedly for the simple reason that the fierce and fiercely artic­ ulate Pounder was one of the few actors who could go head-to-head with Chiklis and not get wiped off the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "The Shield"'s new cycle of 13 epi­ sodes, viewers will see how Claudette handles power and ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her promo­ tion comes as a bit of a consolation prize as she really coveted the chief of police position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, says Ryan, Claudette gets "all of the headaches, but not all of the glory." Her first big challenge is to deal with the volatile Mackey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather than bring him down, Claudette decides to rein him in. "Let's have some serious derailment," Hard-boiled cops WlIgenbach (Jay KlIrne$) lind Wyms (C.e.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pounder) cupcakes compared to Mackey (Michael Chiklis, inset). says Pounder, 51, who is best known for her roles in the 1987 cult film "Baghdad Cafe" and on "ER." As Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angela Hicks, Pounder excelled at keeping Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Romano -that show's former resident bulldog - on a leash, "Because 1 put forward a whip-smart woman, so gee, what's taking so long [to nail Vicl? But then 1 know it takes a long time to take someone down in one of those situations," Pounder says. "Vic's got his fingers in a lot of pies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's covered a lot of bases and people owe him favors." For Ryan, casting Pounder in a role that was originally written for a man was one of the luckiest days of his life. "I just feel like an idiot for not thinking of it sooner," says Ryan. "When I wrote the pilot, there were some good things in it aEld there were some mistakes .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And one of them was [thatl I just went with the stereotype of the older male cop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never gave it any serious thought as to why is this character a man. "When C.C. came in and read, not only did we realize it could be a woman, we realized it had to be a woman and it had to be her. [The detectivel became a much more interesting character with her play­ ing it than it was on paper." After spending four frustrating years on "ER" - a show for which Pounder re­ ceived an Emmy nomination, only to watch her character languish -"The Shield" is sweet redemption. "It's a fantastic opportunity," says the actress, whose initials stand for Carol Christine Hilaria. "She's completely un­ charted waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't ever want to say, 'Oh no, Claudette wouldn't do that.' I'd much rather say, 'What else can she do?' That's been the real fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When 1 said, 'Why can't she have a husband and children?' then husbands and children showed up!' I'm finally at a place where perhaps they do respect me as an actor and will take that leap." Pounder is also thrilled that Claudette, whose ex-husband died in the season fi­ nale, is taking a lover, a white construc­ tion worker brought in on a sweep who keeps finding excuses to come back to the station until Claudette asks him out. "It's about time," says Pounder, 51. "1 think every 50-year-old watching TV is going to be saying, 'Yes!'" Though she's enjoying the stability of a central role on an acclaimed drama, Pounder still finds time to pursue re­ warding private intercsts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She and her husband Boubacar Kane are about to cel­ ebrate the tenth anniversary of the mu­ seum they founded together in Senegal (Pounder was born in Guyana).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for series creator Ryan, he just reupped for two more years on "The Shield." He also has a development deal with FX, but promises not to even begin working on other projects until he's fin­ ished the show's next two seasons. "This will be a very interesting year to see how the audience reacts," says Ryan. "Do they keep coming back or have they forgotten about us? 1 do think this is the kind of show you wouldn't want to push to seasons twelve and trurteen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With six or seven years of 13 to 15 episodes a sea­ son, we could end things pretty intact without embarrassing ourselves."
