                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , J U N E 1 5 , 2 0 0 5Bush Shows Concern For HumanRights...Sometimesby Michael in New York on 6/15/2005 05:52:00 PMNOTE: Here's an update to the posting I did earlier on Bush'scynical use of human rights dissidents when it suits hispurposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush and Australia are giving the cold shoulder to ahigh-ranking Chinese diplomat who wants to defect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ChenYonglin says he's become disillusioned about China and hasuseful info; maybe he's still reeling from the time Chen and hiswife were separated and sent for "reeducation." Everyone canagree Bush is being a putz on this one because China is atrading partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Per the NYT:For the left:Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chen's credentials have not been challenged, and fewdoubt that he would be punished if he returned to China.He held the title of a political first secretary and says hisprincipal duties were to spy on Falun Gong andpro-democracy activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the time he was posted toSydney in 2001, he said he had lost hope that China'sgovernment might change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His job here was to monitor theactivities of dissidents, and almost from the beginning, itweighed on his conscience. "It's dirty work," he said.For the right:[Chen and his wife] had been student activists in thelate 1980's, he at a university in Beijing, she whilestudying law in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were not married atthe time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the Tiananmen Square demonstrationswere put down in 1989, they were sent separately for"re-education," they said.[His wife] said she was assigned to work in a familyplanning program in a rural area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One woman shetended to was eight months pregnant with her secondchild when forced into a hospital for an abortion, shesaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The woman escaped, was caught, and anoperation performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The baby boy, born alive, wasthen killed by the doctors, she said.When will Bush learn to place American values ahead of cynicism andthe coddling of totalitarian governments like China, Saudi Arabia,Pakistan, Uzbekistan (which BOILS ALIVE dissidents) and the rest ofhis "allies"?THE ORIGINAL POST:Bush has made a concerted effort to meet with dissidents fromoverseas...at least when it serves his political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's metpeople from North Korea and even Venezuela -- which shows a lot ofgall, since Bush gave the thumbs-up to a military coup in that countrybecause he didn't cotton to its democratically elected leader.It's all rather puzzling, since Bush has made it perfectly clear he'swilling to ignore international law and our own Constitution when it'sconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bush has been a teensy bit conflicted about whichdissidents to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He can't bring himself to meet with dissidentsfrom Saudi Arabia or Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a major opposition figure fromUzbekistan (Mohammed Salih) is coming to the US from June 27through June 30 and Bush is AGONIZING over what to do.Gosh, should he meet with the guy? And what to do about Uzbekistangunning down hundreds of its own people? Should the culture of lifepresident actually encourage a culture of life?
