(That effective set and lighting design is by Seth Reiser; Jean-Michele Gregory directed.) Daisey takes to the stage and launches into his tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's in a lawless area of Honk Kong that I've visited and which he describes well, an area where you can purchase literally anything from drugs and sex in various combinations to pirated copies of anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey's drug of choice? An iPhone that can be "jail-breaked," or set free so it can be used all over the world and be unconstrained by the limits Apple would place on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey's style is at first a little manic, but it's just like the loud Hawaiian shirts he dons when trying to bumble his way into interesting conversations a la Columbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey addresses each part of the audience, side to side and front to back, with an almost carnival barker air, transparently letting you into the pleasures of his performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His voice rises and falls, he lets out a yowlp when necessary and after a dramatic peak is reached and a change in setting is due, Daisey quietly turns over one sheet from thatstack of papers and we prepare for the switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even someone like myself who enjoys tech toys but would rather run in fright than read a manual or take apart a computer can savor Daisey's obsession with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He relaxes after monologues -- Daisey tells us -- by stripping down his laptop and cleaning each part with pressurized air before putting the 40 odd pieces back together again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He garners laughter by showing himself hypnotized by one of Jobs' legendary press conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey didn't know he needed a new router but after Jobs has spoken, suddenly he's moaning like a baby or a hungry elephant: "I wannna a new router! I wanna new router!" When an actor can get laughs by saying his current router is an 802.11G and the "G" is said dismissively and hatefully and the audience giggleshelplessly, you know he's tapping into something more primal than one particular obsession. "Its soooo sloooooooow!" moans Daisey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the 802.11N -- and here the "N" is said with lasvicious, joyful, even worshipful glee -- is fassssst and we laugh again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where does this story go? It begins with Daisey jail-breaking that iPhone and in the end he hopes rather bluntly to jail-break us from our obsession with the latest toys and our refusal to acknowledge what weknow to be true: that our Apple products and indeed much of our treasured items come from countrieslike China where children as young as 12 work punishing hours, where adults (meaning someone in their mid-20s) whose hands have become mangled and clumsy due to years of repetitive labor are tossed aside and where anyone daring to form a union is jailed or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Daisey is spinning his story, he makes these points far more eloquently than I just did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He travels to an economic free zone in Southern China called Shenzhen and starts talking with the employees who come out of the gigantic factories of Foxconn Technology Group, the single biggest manufacturer of electronics in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey says literally 50% of all electronic products in the world are piecedtogether there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company became infamous when a string of employee suicides garnered internationalattention; but China soon clamped down on its news media and the stories in the world press quickly dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey creates a very strong narrative, at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The interpreter he calls "Kathy" doesn't want to believe the tragic stories of the workers but knows them to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A young female worker talks about her long hours and Daisey says, hey you look pretty young, how old are you and she blithely says 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One trulyremarkable passage involves a man who had been fired after his hand was horribly mangled when it wascaught in a machine. (Needless to say, the man received no medical treatment and was summarily dismissed.) When this man -- who was risking a great deal to meet with Daisey -- said he had been working on the iPad assembly line when the accident occurred, Daisey reached into his bag and pulledout an iPad itself and handed it to the man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of the employees who work in these factories can actually afford to own an iPhone or iPad. (And the factories are massive -- their cafeterias seat literally tens and tens of thousands of people at a time.) The man's face beamed as he held the iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daisey had turned it on and the screen lit up with icons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man brushed his gnarled, useless hand over the surface and the pages flew by with app after app ondisplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone with less skill might have stopped right there, but Daisey knew the kicker was the smileon the man's face as he told the interpreter, "It's a kind of magic." It's a pity Daisey didn't trust his own skills as a performer, the magic of theater and stories in general to get his point across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, as the show progresses and especially towards the end, he stopsMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

(Maybe he'd like tofinally return the calls of China Labor Watch? ) That's exactly where such calls to action belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On stage, Daisey lost faith not just in Apple but a tiny bit in what he does best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Jobs taught everyone the same lesson: the ungainly and awkward is inherently bad and you should never release your work until it's elegant and beautiful in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Hair *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Lake Water ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies ** Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 One Arm *** The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Silence!
