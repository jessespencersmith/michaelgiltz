Wilson tells her story in a charmingly scattershot style, but the throughline is the eight year journey of turning a memoir of Vogue editor Diana Vreeland into the career-peak triumph "FullGallop." Otherwise, she'll jump from her crazy family to sharing horror stories about auditions to life on the set of thehit sitcom "One Day At A Time" enduring the glassy stare of Bonnie Franklin to winning the Tony for "Grey Gardens."It's impressionistic, jumps all around, has no discernible structure and pretty much charms the hell out of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilsonis happy to be pointedly sharp on contemporaries but she's hardest on herself, revealing her fear of success, herpoor self-image and the hard-earned peace that has finally come to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The names come fast and furious -- MarvinHamlisch was an accompanist for Wilson, Tony-winner George Furth was her friend and neighbor, Barbara Cook'spianist Wally Harper gave her her singing voice -- but the name you'll remember, finally, is Mary Louise Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shecould have written an entire book about the making of "Full Gallop" or an entire book about her family or an entirebook about the nightmare of being in that all-female version of "The Odd Couple" or an entire book about the JuliusMonk revues that were so important to her and cabaret at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, she boiled it all down and just gave usthe good stuff. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayMary Louise Wilson's My First Hundred Years in Show Business should be a required read for all actors, no matterwhat stage of their career they are in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a masterpiece of hilarity and deadpan honesty, and a master class inacting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is much to learn from her bible of theatrical experiences, from Macbeth to writing her passion piece FullGallop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary Louise Wilson equals GENIUS. - Kristin Chenoweth, Tony and Emmy Award-winning actor Thank you MLW for writing this book, if only to confirm for me hi diddly de de the actor’s life for me—a life as full ofheartache, waiting, and disappointment as it is, for us all, an absolute delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learning that it would be the same forthe great Mary Louise Wilson is a relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for those not in show biz...get ready to read some truth! - Melissa Leo,Academy Award-winning actor Mary Louise Wilson’s writing is like her acting—deft, droll, and full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her book is a riot of characters metand characters played, of dreams dashed and dreams fulfilled—a funny, frank, and savvy chronicle of a wonderfullife, in the theatre and beyond. - David Hyde Pierce, Tony and Emmy Award-winning actor I…MoreWhat You Say</p>
