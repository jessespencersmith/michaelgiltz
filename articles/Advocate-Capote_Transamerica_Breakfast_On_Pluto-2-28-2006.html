                <p>THE HOLLYWOOD ISSUE Extreme makeovers How did the stars of Capote Breakfast on Pfuto, and Iransamerica go through such radical transformations to play their gay ar trans characters? lts all in the tailorins- and the right [or wrong) wigs and makeup By Michael Giltz ow'd they do it? That's the question moviegoers may have pondered after seeing some of the best movies of the year How did the out- size Philip Seymour Hoffman convince us he was the elfin Truman Capote? How did Cillian Murphy embody such a pretty transvestite in Breahfast on Pluto? And how did the sexy Felicity Huffman become a stolid transgender woman in Transamerica? One big help: behind-the-scenes tal- ent working on their costumes, hair, and makeup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Capote, costumer Kasia Walicka Maimone says they re- jected optical tricks, oversize sets (d la The Lord of the Rings), and even more standard deceptions. "From the begiming, we had some obvi- ous choices that we didn't do, like keeping him in darker colors," says Maimone. 'We can't keep T?uman Capote in darker colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We tailored all the suits, and some of theclassic early'60s-late'50s three-button suits worked great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was all about the shoulders and fitting the style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd use a longer cut of the jacket." And they didn't keep Hoffman in flats when his feet were off-camera or pull any other sleight of hand. 'We had a very quiet process with Philip," says Maimone, who praises the actols collaboration. "I'd call it nonverbal communication We had a wall ofphotos ofT?uman Capote and we spent a lot of time twith himl looking and trying different things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was mysterious in a way Phil...changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He grabbed the essence ofCapote." The slim, waifrsh body of Cillian Mur- phy, on the other hand, suited his charac- ter perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He played Kitten in Breah- fast on Pluto, a decades-spanning tale of a lad who loves feminine fashion-every- thing from glam rock to sensible frocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Costumer Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh spent most of her time having a ball and being annoyed at how easily Murphy www,advocate com THE ADVOCATEslipped into his wardrobe. "We tried trousers on him," explains Mhaoldomhnaigh, "a women's cut in the '70s style, which is very high-waisted, with a flared leg and a little bit of padding in the bum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he just looked drop-dead gorgeous." She laughs. "We were all so jealous." Pluto director Neil Jordan kept using the word "gentle" to describe the character of Kitten, who stumbles through IRA bombings and vicious personal betrayals, delicately refusing to pay any attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Mhaoldomhnaigh found a white fur jacket "that was really sofL and fluffy against his skin." And since Murphy has hairy, manly arms, keeping them covered up was key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shoes, however, were no problem, thanks to the wide platforms of the '70s. "If they had been stilettos, it might have been more awkward," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Transamerica the difficult chal- lenge for costumer Danny Glicker was making a small and feminine woman like Huffman convincing as awkward at being a girl. "Felicity has a gorgeous body and is so petite," says Glicker. "When I first met her, I thought, How am I going to do this? She's gorgeous! So we did lots oflittle tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I dropped her waistline slightly so her waist was sit- ting at her hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Felicity has a gorgeous, tiny waist, but of course [her character] Bree has a more masculine waist." One big help came from trans people, specifically film consultants CalperniaAddams and Andrea James, who run a company called Deep Stealth to help in all facets ofa person's transition. "One of the things Andrea and Calpernia pointed out to me was that very often when you transition later in life, as Bree has, you haven't been building your wardrobe your whole life," says Glicker. 'You have to go out and buy everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when you go out on that sort of shopping trip. you have as many mis- takes as you do successes." Jason Hayes-a hair, wig, and make- up artist who created wigs for Huffman and did Addams's hair for the film- drew on his own experiences in the drag and trans community He first did drag on a dare when he was 19 years old and went on to win numerous beauty pageants, such as Miss Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Hayes knows better than most that transgender women and drag queens are very different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bree had to look clumsy, because she was just learning how to apply makeup and do her hair, but she couldn't look pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing tricks to give Huffman the ap- pearance of a man making the transition to a woman, Hayes explains,'lVe tucked the wig behind her ears to make them stick out a little bit." Also, since the Bree character had recently had hair plugs put in, the wig looks sparser toward the front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes adds, "We had a dash of gray be- cause that's what her hair would natural- ly be doing then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't more than fouror frve strands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had to look awkward but not like a bad wig-it was a really tricky balancing act." He suggested Huffman's makeup would be thicker and applied by hand- Bree couldn't afford fancy extras like brushes and pads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no expensive makeup either: Someone at Bree's stage would probably slip into a drugstore and grab a Max Factor Pan-Stik. "Her eye- brows didn't quite match," adds Hayes "Ids very subtle, but it registers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had to look like she was learnins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have to root for her." Costumer Glicker is proud of Bree's pink suit that appears early in the film, an item that had to look cheap but chosen with care. '"That was a $99 suit," he says, "which for Bree, ofcor:rse, is a huge luxury." And he'll always remember the most nerve-racking moment-the frlming of a party where Bree appears alongside peo- ple who've made the transition in real life. "I remember torturing myself a little bit about the moment Felicity walks into the room as Bree with mostly trans women and, I think, one trans man," says Glick- er. "I was discreetly in the corner watch- ing their expressions and thinking, Please, please, please, just recognize this woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't want to see any head- shaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a look of recognition and acceptance."
