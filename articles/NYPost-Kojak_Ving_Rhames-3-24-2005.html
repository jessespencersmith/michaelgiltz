                <p>By MTcHAEL GTLTZ l!)/ri HIS is NOT your father's "Koiak." As played by the com- manding Ving Rhames in the new USA series (Friday night at 9), Kojak is a cop who plays by his own rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kolak twists the laws so a criminal behind bars can be re- united with his kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kojak turns a blind eye to vig- ilante justice, but feels troubled by his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has a chaste romantic re- Iationship, isn't ashamed to cry on the shoulder of his best friend (played by ChazzFalm- interi) and - in what may well be a TV first - discretely makes the sign of the cross when leaving a gruesome crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it any surprise to find out that Rhames - who led a hard- scrabble childhood with an ab- sent father - felt destined to put his stamp on this role? Unfailingly polite, Rhames doesn't suffer fools gladly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although "Kojak" hasn't de-buted yet, he already seems bored by the inevitable ques- tions about the lollipop (still there), ti;e hat (sometimes) and the catch pi:rase (tweaked for a new millennium).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That same seriousness extends to his faith. 'I think quite a bit oforga- nized religion has become big business," says Rhames. "Jesus Christ never solil the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He never gave a sermon and then said, 'For $8.99, you can buy the CD.' "I try to base my life on the pri r;iples of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I try to raise my family on the princi- ples of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know if that makes me religious, "I'm a God-fearing man and I know the only reason why I am here going from pc,' .- ity to where I am now is God has His hand on my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tell people, I didn't choose acting; God chose me to act." So expect Kojak to be princi- pled but complicated, a good man making hard decisions in a world where prostitutes can be murde ,'ed, and no one dares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expect a man who ci,n be scaryquestioning a criminal but a big softie around kids - just like Rhames. "All I want and all I even ask of people in Holll'wood is look, just be honest with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please don't lie to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever the situation is, be honest with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think a lot of that part of mypersonality will come out in this Kojak," he says. "He is a man who cares about the death of hookers. the death of anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's also a guy who does somethins that one has to question: DoSs the ends justify the means? He's very imperfect."Ving Rhames is making the tough New York detective, Kojak, his own.</p>
