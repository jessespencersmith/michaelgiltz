                <p>Tuesday, November 5, 2019  DOCUMENTARY FILM Dharma Bum Errol Morris’ Dunderheaded Steve Bannon Documentary  November 4, 2019 Michael Giltz If you want to make a film about the denizens of a small town, you call someone like director Errol Morris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to take down a two-bit shyster, once upon a time you called Mike Wallace and ordered up a hard- hitting expose for 60 Minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mike Wallace interviewing a thoughtful intellectual? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Errol Morris confronting a doofus doing damage? No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Confronting is not in Morris’s DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMERICAN DHARMA (1/5 stars) Directed by: Errol Morris Running time: 95 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one told Morris that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, winning an Oscar for The Fog Of War: Eleven Lessons From The Life Of Robert S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McNamara apparently taught him he’s the perfect person to speak with and understand political gadflySteve Bannon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that’s how we arrive at the worst film of Morris’s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Dharma glorifies Bannon, treats him like a Very Important Person, seems to think he has intellectual depths waiting to be plumbed, and gives him thesetting of his dreams in which to spout nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worst thing one can say is that Bannon must surely lovethis movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morris would hope that’s because his documentary is fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morris is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fair film, a seriousfilm, a documentary rooted in facts would not please Bannon in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perplexed But Polite Instead, Morris has badly conceived and badly executed American Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a perplexed but polite profile ofBannon, an unimportant producer of right-wing “documentaries” turned hate merchant for the Breitbart website.Most famously, for a very brief period of about one year, Bannon was a political player leading DonaldTrump’s campaign and then a top adviser during the early days of a very unexpected Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bannon’s usefulness gone and his desire for media attention too strong, Trump dumped him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Bannon wanders the world, hoping to step back into the spotlight by coaching far-right politicians liked accused child-molestert Roy Moore of Alabama, stirring up muck around the Catholic Church, and cheering on fascists likeJair Bolsonaro of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, Bannon is a crappy filmmaker, a political operative of very little substance who got lucky precisely once, and the opposite of a deep thinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker , Bannon finds it easy to encourage anarchy, to yell and scream and burn things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Offering up ideas for what comes next or even explaining therage he’s kindled? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Third B.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s the central problem with American Dharma, the third in a trilogy of portrait films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first was The FogOf War, focusing on Robert McNamara, the “architect” of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McNamara is a controversial, significantfigure in recent American history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His performance in the film is half witness for the defense and half mea culpaand it’s fascinating to see McNamara wrestle with what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To some degree, McNamara has regrets andwants to explain or understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can debate whether he’s seen the light or just trying to rescue hisreputation, but Morris’s film observes all this calmly and keenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second film is The Unknown Known, about Donald Rumsfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s less satisfying if only because Rumsfeld is such a Sphinx-like person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s certainly not had a Road To Damascus moment and so Morris’s hands-offobservation isn’t nearly so useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet Rumsfeld is also unquestionably a figure of import in recent Americanhistory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was a congressman and adviser to four Presidents, not to mention Secretary Of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So his self-serving dance with the facts has a certain fascination.← Harriet Tubman, Action Hero Keep Your Eye on the Farrow →But now we come to American Dharma, where Morris wrongly treats Bannon as if he too has some intellectual heft, as though Bannon weren’t a footnote even compared with minor historical figures like McNamara andRumsfeld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bannon spouts off secondhand philosophizing such as the fourth turning, the pseudo-scientific claim that history occurs in cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he’s no historian or thinker of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film attempts to undercut some of Bannon’sflimsier dissembling by tossing up headlines and video that glancingly show him to be full of b.s., but thosebarely register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest problem is that Morris can’t debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without breaking a sweat, William F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buckley Jr. or Jon Stewart could eviscerate Bannon in one segment of their old talk shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One would do it with ideas, the otherwith comic insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morris just sits there, befuddled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twelve O’Clock Low Bannon and Morris also discuss old movies, with all the depth of two guys at a bar drinking beer and waxingpoetic over The Shawshank Redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bannon is no film scholar, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morris has produced an entire film with a wrongheaded conceit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he doesn’t show Bannon wandering around and thinking deep thoughts, he interviews him in a mock-up of a set from the Gregory Peck film TwelveO’Clock High, the Quonset hut where an American bomber group meets before heading out on dangerous raids.Morris has recreated it from the film with meticulous detail, down to a Robin Hood mug that sits on a mantel.The men turn it a certain way when someone gives them a mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s one of Bannon’s favorite movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bannon’s rambling, confused praise of that film or The Bridge On The River Kwai and the like accomplishes little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it’s bizarre that Morris presents him in such a heroic light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film ends with Bannonstriding up to the mantle and turning the mug because, by God, he’s got a mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How’s that for glorification? Actually, the final shot is the Quonset hut going up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Morris intends that as an ironic commentary on the senseless damage this man has wrought, ruining even his own movie-centric idea of what itmeans to sacrifice and be a hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But really he’s just burning shit up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morris doesn’t understand that Bannonwill see it, nod his head and think, “Cool!” Tags: American Dharma , Errol Morris , Steve BannonMartin Landau Indicts Hollywood for Crimes and Misdemeanors  February 16, 2016 Robert Redford Premieres The Company You Keep  April 2, 2013 Three Tennis Docs ToGet You Psyched For The U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open  August 24, 2018 Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for the New York Post, New York DailyNews, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Huffington Post, Premiere Magazine,Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He co-hosts the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox . You May Also Like Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required fields are marked * CommentName * Email * WebsiteSubscribe to our mailing list Social Twitter Facebook Recent Posts Keep Your Eye on the Farrow Dharma Bum Harriet Tubman, Action Hero ‘The Irishman’: Scorsese’s Late-Career Wiseguy Masterwork Re-TerminatorRecent Comments Michael De La Riva on Die Hard is a Halloween Movie Sam Winters on Darkness Visible Robert L Lane on Die Hard is a Halloween Movie babajide ayodele on The Skin-Deep Dilemma of ‘Insatiable’ Ken Kurson on ‘How To Fight Anti-Semitism’ Archives November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018August 2018 July 2018 May 2017 February 2016 May 2015February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 March 2014 December 2013 September 2013 April 2013February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 July 2012 November 2011 September 2011 June 2011May 2011 March 2011 May 2001 March 2001 October 2000 August 2000 July 2000June 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999 October 1999 September 1999August 1999 July 1999June 1999 May 1999 April 1999 March 1999 February 1999 September 1998 June 1998 May 1998April 1998 February 1998 October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 June 1997 May 1997April 1997 March 1997 February 1997 January 1997 November 1996 September 1996 August 1996June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 February 1996 January 1996 October 1995 August 1995February 1995 January 1995Editor: Neal Pollack | General Manager, Advertising: Kevin Sanders – 201-724-0340 Book and Film Globe California Globe Fine Art Globe Modern Consensus New Jersey Globe Rock and Roll Globe© 2019 Book and Film Globe About Us | Terms &amp; Conditions | Privacy Policy | Advertise with us |</p>
