                <p>F R I D A Y , J U L Y 2 9 , 2 0 0 5Kudos To "Paula Zahn Now" For Second"Conversion" Storyby Michael in New York on 7/29/2005 12:37:00 AMOkay, so Thursday night "Paula Zahn Now" did another story onthe snake oil scam of "conversion therapy." (If you'reinterested, the show is rerun at 2 a.m.) Suddenly Zahn wastouting Part Two of their special report -- though I recheckedpart "one" and there's no hint they planned a followup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eitherthe story generated so much attention they decided to squeezeanother segment out of the footage or -- best case scenario --they were as unhappy with the first one as we were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainlythey improved a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's late and I lambasted them thefirst time around, so forgive this lengthy analysis.Reporters have to be instant experts on every issue they dealwith and the show clearly came up short on night one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eitherinternally or based on feedback from viewers and the web(which Zahn even referenced), they listened and responded tosome of the factual complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it could have been evenbetter -- but their response was certainly far more admirablethan simply ignoring the criticism or defending the originalpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though of course I assume mainly they did anotherpiece because the first one generated talk.Among the improvements: they made clear that Love in ActionRefuge (yes, as numerous threaders pointed out, this makesthem LIARs) is NOT a registered mental health clinic -- onlyone counselor is licensed. (And I assume that counselor couldbe reprimanded or lose their license for engaging in therapythat the APA has condemned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps they're only licensed bythe state?) Since it ISN'T a mental health clinic, I still takeissue with CNN describing chat sessions as "group therapy."Shouldn't group therapy be reserved only for sessions led by aprofessional? Is the only licensed therapist always present atevery session? If not, it doesn't deserve this patina ofprofessional respectability -- especially since what they practicehas been condemned by every reputable medical and mentalhealth organization in the country as dangerous, wrong, andpotentially extremely damaging.They still incorrectly describe the leader Rev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smid [what aname!] as "rejecting homosexuality," a claim these fringegroups know they can no longer pretend to make -- even Rev.Smid doesn't claim he's now straight, just that he won't act onthose desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, it's important to note that just a fewyears ago they lied and said people could choose to be straightand that being gay was merely a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Society is so farbeyond such idiocy, today even the far right doesn't trot that lieout anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the IDs of the people who went through theprogram are poorly thought out: two young men interviewedare labeled "graduate," which again gives this sketchyorganization that is seriously condemned by the entire medicalcommunity an air of seriousness it doesn't deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can'tgraduate from a scam.All the footage used was presumably shot the first time around.But what a difference a day makes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the new emphasis onfacts and the overwhelming medical opinion about this fraud,they even used a better quote from Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drescher of the APAthan the one they used the first night.
