(Jesse Jacksonmight want to skip the show; two of the biggest laughs come at his expense.) For the first half of the play, that's it and it's enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson has an easy authority on stage; he evokes EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; November 24, 2011 Like 63 Posted: 10/14/11 05:40 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Entertainment Alerts Sign UpCONNECT FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT TECH MEDIA LIFE &amp; STYLE CULTURE COMEDY HEALTHY LIVING WOMEN LOCAL MORELike 51KRihanna Movies Television The Oscars Armchair Detective More Log inKing's famous cadences mostly when delivering the lines of a sermon he is working on about why the United States is going to hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Camae seems more of a "character" than a person at first, but Bassett winsyou over with her unassuming charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She savors the show's two key speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first takes place when King asks her what she would say to the striking sanitation workers of Memphis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Camae gets a full head of steam as she whoops it up, ultimately leaping on the bed and letting loose blue language that hilariously and pointedly gets her anger and frustration across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It might be more Malcolm than Martin, but King likes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the show moves away from this workmanlike beginning, it loses focus a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hall too consciously seizes the moment of King's final night on earth for a reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the two actors keep the humor andhumanity flowing amidst increasingly strained comic territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the finale, the stage bursts apart and Camae delivers a potent glimpse of the future of America forged in part by King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's another rip-roaring monologue, and who knows what Bassett might have done with it if allowed? Instead of letting Bassetttake the stage and engage our imagination the way theater excels at, we're bludgeoned with a multi- media stream of video and photographs meant to illustrate the flow of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The technology simply overwhelms the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience wants the play to take us to church; instead this production tookus to an IMAX movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of the play's missteps should overshadow two engaging performances by Jackson and Bassett or the fact that Hall has certainly delivered what should be a commercial crowd-pleaser and has the makings ofa serious talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tech elements unfortunately underline the mythic elements that weigh the story down, complete with ominous thunder and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set is mostly that hotel room, reportedly recreated down to the minutest detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes it puzzling they should display a mock-up of the Lorraine Hotel on the curtain raiser that looks nothing like the actual one, which is now the home of the National Civil Rights Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A photograph of the real location would have looked just as evocative and been rooted in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a pity The Mountaintop didn't do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
