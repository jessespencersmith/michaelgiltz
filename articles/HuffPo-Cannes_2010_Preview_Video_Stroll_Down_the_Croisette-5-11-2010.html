What's Your Reaction: Read More: Cannes Film Festival , Cinema , Croisette , Ken Loach , Lumiere , Mike Leigh , Movie Posters , Movies , Queersighted , Xavier Dolan , Entertainment News Bonjour, cinephiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll be covering the Cannes Film Festival for Huffington Post, the blog site Queersighted (I'll be covering the gay angle of Cannes for them), my awesome entertainment podcast Showbiz Sandbox and anyone who wants to send me money. (Yep, Cannes is expensive and freelance gigsare few and far between.) Robin Hood debuts on Wednesday, though in a rather deflating move, it'sbeen screened for critics everywhere and already reviewed (poorly, for the most part) by the trades, major papers like the New York Daily News andothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can't help feeling silly flying out to Cannes and then having the movies shown to journalists back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But of course Cannes hates this and fights it whenever possible -- it's the constant tug between exclusivity and wanting stars from big Hollywood movies to walk the red carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But enough griping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The festival looks very promising, with new works from major directors like Ken Loach (a late addition), Mike Leigh, Bertrand Tavernier, Doug Liman (the lone American inCompetition), Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, a strong Asian contingent, Stephen Frears, rising talent Xavier Dolan (who hopes to capitalize on his major success last Cannes -- I Killed My Mother -- with his second film, Heartbeats aka Les Amours Imaginaires ), Jean-Luc Godard, Rumanian Cristi Puiu, and many many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The longest film at the fest is Carlos , a look at the assassin Carlos The Jackal directed by Olivier Assayas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always insist on watching whatever random film happens to be the longest filmscreening at Cannes and it quite often pays huge dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Iceland volcano is STILL mucking with airplane travel but for the most part people are delayed, rather than frustrated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let me close with some video: this is a stroll along part of the maindrag at Cannes and a look at the movie posters for upcoming films that wrap around the major hotels.This year's crop is decidedly mundane compared to years past, which is another sign of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Celebrity Skin | Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 8 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

(The accreditat ion office is very fair; I say that even though they have been cruelly blunt with me -- if you are representi ng a serious outlet doing serious coverage, you will always get accreditat ion when you apply in time.) I'm sorry but Cannes is the Wimbledon of film festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're a film lover, how could you not want to be here andsee new films by Mike Leigh, ken Loach, Godard, Cristi Puiu, Oliver Stone, Gregg Araki, JiaZhangke, Stephen Frears and many more.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 09:32 AM on 5/12/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 09:50 AM on 5/12/2010 Permalink | Share it</p>
