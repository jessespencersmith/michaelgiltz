We won'tknow until Friday because the ratings are beingheld back for three days by Nielsen while 421 stations around the country convert to all digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This could seriously mess with the overnights and Nielsen wants to make sure it gets the numbersright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So on to the Top 36, with a guarantee from me that 20+ million people were checking out Tatiana, Danny and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I listed Tatiana first, but the suggestion from Mediaweek's Marc Berman that she will be the top female vote getter is too horrible to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the next three weeks, we get 12 contestants performing for 80 seconds each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The top male and female vote getter move on, as does the next highest vote getter of them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes nine in all with a Wild Card round where the rest get to perform again and the judges select three more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So out of 100,000 auditions, it's down to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suppose you could argue about the mix of people in each group but it seemed to work out alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think more than three people gave a decent performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackie Tohn -- raspy rocker chick wearing some hot pants from the Seventies and singing Elvis Presley's "A Little Less Conversation," a minor tune of his reworked and made famous via a Nikead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sort of rapped a bit and growled a bit and I liked her Farrah Fawcett hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But veryunmemorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bizarrely, Randy, Kara and Paula all said it was great...except for the singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? Ricky Braddy -- One of a number of people being introduced to us practically for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly a judge favorite and I dug the red velvet jacket, but he was draggy and a bit precious to me, Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Alexis Grace -- looking rather mature and dressed up, Grace sang Aretha's "Never Loved A Man" and while she never owned it and was a tad dowdy looks-wise, all the judges loved her and Smon trotted out the Kelly Clarkson reference, which was the first time Grace lost her reserve and seemed overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the audience we get a glimpse of Neil Patrick Harris (a hell of a singer himself) and Ted Danson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only they would have a theme week devoted to Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Horrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brent Keith -- sang "Hick Town" with some serious dimples on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wasn't great, but this was the first time I felt like the performer knew who they were and what kind of artist they wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy and Paula liked him, Kara was mixed and Simon thought no one would remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon also got off the funniest line when Paula named some former Idols who recorded country music as an example of the success Brent could have and Simon responded with "What HAS happened to Bucky Convington?" As always, he is seen as mean for being blunt when in fact it wasPaula who was silly for touting Bucky as a success story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think country fans could support Brentbut unfortunately two much more popular male singers performed tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stevie Wright -- 17 year old sweetie who sang Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me" very poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the judges panned her, with Randy, Kara and Paula all saying, "Who are you?" instead of just saying a performance was bad, they repeatedly spent the night telling performers they should havestuck with the type of song they wowed them with during auditions. (Was Stevie really supposed tokeep dragging out old soul classics like "At Last" every week? The truth is that you have to sing allsorts of genres to win on Idol, so anyone showing versatility has a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if Wright haddone a good job, they would have praised her for showing another side of her personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simonalmost made her cry by saying she would be going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anoop Desai -- sang "Angel Of Mine," a tune I don't even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was too serious an the judges were all mixed, saying they liked him but not the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Simon said he had "massive likability" and thanks to all the airtime he enjoyed, I bet Anoop has enough of a fan base to make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey Carlson -- sang "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" by the Police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tons of hair on display and the band sounded especially tinny in the background, prompting Simon to make one of numerous derogatory comments about the arrangements and the band's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone hated it but I hated it when the judges acted as if no one should ever sing a Police tune. "Nobodydoes those songs" insisted Kara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the way, this is really Kara's first chance to shine and shehasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought she fit in smoothly during the auditions, but I'm waiting for her to offer up onefresh insight that none of the others had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, she's either gushing too much or seeming to echoRandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's only so much you can say about an 80 second performance, so that's not a lack ofimagination on her part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you've got a new judge, you want to hear them SAY something newand different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, why are they there? Michael Sarver -- dragged out that Gavin DeGraw tune and to my mind made Brent look good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All his attempts to get gritty or rock out fell flat.Ann Marie Boskovich -- more Aretha, this time "(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman." She's one of the ringers, a demo singer and she looked great in a blue dress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I felt like the judges were harder on her because of her pro background, which is appropriate in my book: she shouldhave the experience to shine more at this early stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon's comment - that if they were lookingfor the "best hotel singer in California" -- was especially apt and cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Fowler -- butchered Michael Jackson's "Rock With You," especially on the big high notes, which strangely was the one part of his awful performance the judges complimented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agai, kara insisted that "'Rock With You' is the kiss of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It belongs to one artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Jackson."Unless of course you sing it well, in which case it would have been a great performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tatiana Del Toro -- a nice pretty outift that wasn't too dressy (often the mistake women make when singing something like a Whitney Houston ballad), Tatiana was relatively demure, sure, butexactly how kooky could she behave when standing onstage and singing "Saving All My Love ForYou?" Really, what did the judges expect her to do? Her dramatic pose at the end was priceless, aswas her response to the question 'who are you?' "I fit everywhere," said Tatiana. "It's world music.It's all genres." Yes, book her on a reality show pronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, do not put her through for not totally Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...
