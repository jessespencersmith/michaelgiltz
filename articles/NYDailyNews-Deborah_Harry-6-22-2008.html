Harry also improvised a flirtation during one scene with the hero, 35-year-old Alby (Matt McGrath), a husband and father who idealizes his barelyfinished childhood and - in a fit of nostalgia - goes on a road trip to a faded amusement park. "In real life it would be a beautiful thing for a person to really embrace what they're doing so wholeheartedly," says Harry about her character. "I know it's part of the whole arrested-development theme, but there's something beautiful about it and so sweet." And there's something very satisfying about touring with Blondie to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their best album, "Par- allel Lines," which the group will performin its entirety at the Nokia Theater tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The album, which included hits like "Heart of Glass," just hit the U.K.'s Top 40 again thanks to its showing up in a com- mercial directed by David Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thanks to more recent albums and hit singles like "Maria," Blondie can avoid the trap of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band, which was recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, also will play at least bne song from Har$s2007 album "Necessary Evil." One listene4 U2's The Edge, consid- ered it one of the best of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet Harry, who became a star thanks mostly to "Parallel Lines," still has mixed feelings about the album. "I'm not totally in love with every song, but I feel like I can stand up for it," she says. "I'm proud of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was a long time ago and the music is really okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of it's a little melancholic and sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And some of it, I think, 'Well, that was a ctaztjt person.'" Which song makes her think that? "I'm not telling," she says, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael GiltzDeborah Harry in the fish-out-of-water tale'Full Grown Men'</p>
