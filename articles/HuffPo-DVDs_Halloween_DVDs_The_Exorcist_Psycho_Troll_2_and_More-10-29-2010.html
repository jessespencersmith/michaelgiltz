They boast that it's "the scariest movie of all time" without seeming to be bragging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly, if you want to experience at home,this edition is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I first watched the film alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you haven't seenit yet, isn't this the perfect time? PSYCHO ($26.98 BluRay; Universal) -- For a long time, Psycho was lower on my list of favorite Hitchcock films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lady Vanishes, Rear Window, Notorious, North By Northwest and the like all scored higher with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I appreciated Psycho but found it too basic, too obvious and the ending tootricksy to satisfy somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's Alfred Hitchcock so of course you cross paths with the film again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andeach time I found it stranger, more interesting, more...odd than just the most sophisticated slasher filmof them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I went looking for a quote to use about the rain on my radio show at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I was able to see how bold and unconventional it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not just the disappearance of the "lead" in the early going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that incredibly lengthy scene between Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh where they talk and 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS jwoww naked miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant snooki nude More Celebrity News at People.com PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss Like 720 Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton Joins Future In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp; Vanessa Hudgens Back On? READ MORE Willliam and Kate's Love Story talk and then share a bite and talk some more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perkins is so good, so intriguing as Norman -- it's really quite moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His character is so full and rich, the last thing you're doing is waiting for the violence to explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course the film has so many innovative aspects, despite being shot in a down and dirty manner Hitchcock embraced for his TV anthology series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get loads of extras including commentaryby Stephen Rebello, the author of a book on the making of this film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You also get Truffaut's interviewexcerpts with Hitch, which is as close to a full commentary from him as we'll ever have. imagine what a treat that would be: Hitchcock holding forth in droll glory for nearly two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who knows? Maybe Shadow Of A Doubt will grow on me too and I'll finally agree with Hitchcock that that's his greatest film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW ($34.99; FOX) -- The most successful midnight movie of all time may not be suitable for a high school production (duh, Mr Schuester!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, it may not even be suitable for home viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly, the movie is pretty awful unless you see it with a crowd in a theater OR bring friends over, switch to the version that let's you see and hear the audience respond to all theprompts and prepare a lot of toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The usual fun extras including a sing-along, outtakes, an alternateopener and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE ($24.98 IFC) -- Let me be absolutely clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have not watched The Human Centipede .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am not going to watch The Human Centipede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My friend Aaron tells me it's actually quite well done (and he's no horror fanatic) but I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just talking about the movie makes me squeamish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the sort of opener that will send some of you scurrying to add it to your Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The setup is simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A doctor who specializes in separating conjoined twins now wants to create a new being:he's kidnapped a Japanese businessman and now is going to surgically attach two women -- mouth to anus -- behind him to create...the human centipede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then he does it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm out of here.TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift Kourtney K.'s StunningBikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES More Celebrity News at Popeater.com One And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,236 Comments Esteemed Film Critic Group Picks The Year's Best Movie 9 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,031 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 106 Comments Ashton Kutcher: Training, Paranoid About Real Life 'End Of Days' 904 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 66 CommentsThere's No Viral Video Like'Home' Michelle Williams on Keeping Heath's MemoryAliveIT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN ($24.98 on BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- What a relief to turn to something as decent and Norman Rockwell-ish as this Peanuts special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To me, it's easily the best of the bunch after A Charlie Brown Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as Linus endures the mockery of everyone in his lonely desire to spot the Great Pumpkin, it's rather pointed and touching on matters of faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You also get It's Magic, Charlie Brown and a featurette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a TV special, it's delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at nearly $20 even on sale, it's quite pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping they do on BluRay what they did on DVD: collect all the specials for inexpensive sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT ($19.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) -- More interesting as a phenomenon than a movie, The Blair Witch Project is the lo-fi clever stunt of a horror film put out on BluRay with the bells and whistles it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alternate endings, commentary, a look at the film's legacy in indie filmmaking and pop culture and the other usual suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, you have to admire the movie's refusal toexplain it all or give a "satisfying" ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Breaking the rules is always a smart move, especially on a no- budgeter hoping to gain attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NFL House Of Representatives Facebook Video Gun Control iPad Haiti Earthquake Atheism Sarah Palin MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST SPLICE ($35.99 BluRay and $28.98 regular DVD; Warner Bros.) PREDATORS ($39.99 BluRay or $29.98 regular; FOX) -- It may star Oscar winner Adrien Brody and the talented Sarah Polley but this is a B movie through and through, which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two scientists desperate to keep their project afloat genetically splice human DNA with a different animal to create anentirely new creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, they keep it in the barn where the creature blossoms into a scary/sadbeast with childlike feelings and a desire to please, really please, Brody at the expense of Polley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I found fascinating about the film was the misogyny that runs through it: Polley is a harridan who keeps Brody in line and everyone comments on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she pushes him to this godlike hubris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And whose DNAdoes she use? This from a woman who resists marriage and doesn't want children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No surer sign of a female character's evilness is his disinterest or refusal to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't a strand of the film or a feminist interpretation: it IS the film and Brody must dominate and defeat Polley (i.e grow a pair, to usea caveman term) in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tale itself is familiar and not spiced up in any new way so the misogyny angle is the only thing giving this film any interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brody also stars in the Predators sequel which most fans considered the best in the series since the original, which is faint praise but still praise nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TROLL 2 ($19.99 BluRay: MGM) -- Should the worst film ever made even want to be on BluRay? Shouldn't it stick to grainy VHS and midnight movie houses? All genuinely bad movies (which must bemade with passion and a belief that they're good to be really bad) work far far better with a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you must watch it at home, by all means invite your friends over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's silly to laugh all by yourself.HAMMER HORROR: TCM GREATEST CLASSIC FILMS ($27.98; Warner Bros.) -- Before gore and sexual violence became the norm, horror was once a B movie genre with flair, and no one offered quality spookiness better than the British label Hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They tackled the classics with aplomb, and hereyou get two Draculas and two Frankensteins: Horrors of Dracula, Dracula Has Risen From The Grave,The Curse Of Frankenstein and Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed. (Even their titles are fun.) Peter Cushing stars in all four, with Christopher Lee in three of them as the vampire and the beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solid fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALTITUDE ($34.98 BluRay and $26.97 regular; Anchor Bay) -- Small plane with passengers is menaced by a terrible storm and some sort of flying octopus-like creature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reminds you, naturally, of the TwilightZone episode with William Shatner, but with more comely young people and no suspense over whether they're imagining it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directed by Canadian Kaare Andrews, who got his start as an award-winning comic book writer and illustrator. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does not obligate him in any way to speak positively or negatively of their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: Catholic Exorcist Plies His Lonely Trade By Daniel Burke Religion News Service (UNDATED) Pity the poor exorcist, caught between evil spirits eager to invade human bodies and a societyskeptical that...Comments 6 Pending Comments 0View FAQ 173 Fans 114 Fans 266 Fans Kardashians SUED For $75 Million Over Debit...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director: 'Ghostbusters 3' Script Is Ready Gwyneth Paltrow To Return To 'Glee' As...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zac Efron And Vanessa Hudgens Back Together?:...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although of course the #1 classic here is "Psycho" I would not put "The Exorcist" that far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What makes Exorcist an "art film" as well as a pop classic is the way Frankenhei mer stubbornly refuses not to take his subject matter completely seriously and presents it in the most natural andlogical way possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what makes it completely terrirfyin g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also think "The Blair Witch Project" for similar reasons, is nearly a complete success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thefilmmakers courageous ly break rules and refuse to compromise with convention s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As David's comment below illustrate s, Hitchcock' s work on Psycho will be analyzed by film buffs forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And righfully so: it's a virtual encycloped ia of film method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a pity that too often in our enthusiasm to praise Hitchcock we forget to acknowledg e that Perkins gives one of the very best performanc es in the history of American cinema, an achievemen t made even more impressive by the knowledge that Hitchcock gave his actors notoriousl y little direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's so masterful about Hitchcock' s approach to film-makin g is on textbook display in Psycho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all about thwarting audience expectatio ns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You set them up and then knock 'em down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scene where Norman and Marion chat has an undercurre nt of tension, but it's ultimately fairly comforting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marion has realized she's gone down the wrong path and she's going to right her wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Normanseems sad, but he's very amicable, Perkins plays this just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, wham! The whole plot,carefully crafted for 40 minutes, is totally derailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audience expectatio n turns to the money Marion has stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The camera pans over it several times as it sits wrapped in a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again,masterful craft here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And again our expectatio ns get the smack-down .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throughout the rest of film what is anticipate d is not what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is more than just 'the twist', a popular plot device in Hollywood today since the success of The Sixth Sense, it's audience manipulati on from the bottom up, not the top down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins with the very first scene which quotes the time as 2:43. 2:43? Whyso precise? Well, precision is the name of the game here and it's about to work on your head withthe camera as the surgeon's scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Psycho is the horror masterpiec e against which all other horror films bear comparison .Recency | Popularity FirstGame72 12:32 PM on 11/01/2010 Permalink | Share it 3fingerbrown 05:41 PM on 10/31/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER David Durham 10:04 AM on 10/31/2010 Permalink | Share itComments are closed for this entry View All 173 Fans 366 Fans 31 FansNice assesment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes a truly great artist to have the courage and vision to go completely outside of the convetnion s of a medium and make it work completely .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is no accident that Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hitchcock is pretty much the undisputed greatest english languagefilm director pre 1960's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Psycho without the music wouldn't be anywhere near the classic it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching it with the sound offwill prove that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music helped but, Perkins had a good hand in it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FirstGame72 12:25 PM on 11/01/2010 Permalink | Share it Puller58 05:23 AM on 10/31/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER drxcreatures 06:12 AM on 12/27/2010 Permalink | Share it</p>
