                <p>Wednesday, September 26, 2018  COMICS #SAD! ‘Doonesbury’ Takes On Trump Garry Trudeau Transcends Late Night’s Tepid Satire  September 26, 2018 Michael Glitz  0 Comments September 2018 marks the 50th anniversary of Doonesbury , the first comic strip to win the Pulitzer Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It began as a football-centric goof at Yale (see, not all the news out of Yale is bad!) and now exists mostly online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know a comic strip is in good shape when it’s nimble enough to make savvy jokes about micro-aggressionsand at the same time get rueful laughs via flashbacks. “Peanuts” had reruns but Doonesbury gets playfully metawith the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comparing Watergate to Trumpgate is easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But who else could do so by flashingback to a character’s younger self taking down Nixon on the radio some 40 years ago? It’s not the politics that make Doonesbury both relevant and enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saturday Night Live gets a few chuckles from its on-target but simple-minded sketches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trudeau’s creation is much richer and always grounded incharacter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consider the scene showing a mother and her college-age daughter discussing gender pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Themom, Boopsie, is worried she’ll mess up and offend her daughter Sam’s friends when they visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s genuine,amusing dialogue and the kicker is when Sam reassures her mom not to stress by saying: “He, she, they and itare all totally cool!” The slightly clueless might think this punchline is about the “absurdity” of those pronouns.But Trudeau never uses humor to mock the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pause a moment and you’ll realize Sam is just teasingher mom, the way kids always do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That turns a topical reference into something timeless.← Reading ‘The Goldfinch’ on My Late Mother’s Kindle Just When I Thought I Was Out, They Pull Me Back In When Your Alter Ego IsI almost referred to that moment as a “joke” but changed it to “scene.” And that’s the greatness of Doonesbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s not acollection of jokes and gags and topical humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It does featuremajor events of the day, pop-cultural and world figures and evensurreal satire, all of it very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the heart of the strip aredozens of real characters grappling with the joys and frustrationsof daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trudeau is telling their story and it grows richer andmore complex with each passing year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly, not every strip is focused on Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This collection tackles marijuana growers, feminism and, withoutmaking too much of it, the constant presence of smart phones is its own running gag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Trudeau has been making hay of Trump for decades and few can skewer the Presidentlike “Doonesbury,” whether it’s tweets from journalist Roland B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedley mocking the White House bydelivering slavish praise or mocking the media itself by showing it breathlessly covering the President’s endlessgolf games with live coverage and counting down to Trump’s 500th mulligan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Trudeau explains in hisintroduction, satire rarely changes minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It strives only to humorously afflict the comfortable and comfort theafflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Success! Though the fact that we still need Trump skewered? #SAD!
