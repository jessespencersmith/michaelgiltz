                <p>Theater: The Trip to Bountiful and CicelyTyson Are Tony Favorites THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL *** STEPHEN SONDHEIM THEATRE The Tony nominations have just been announced. ( Go here for a complete list of nominees. ) If you've seen the new Broadway revival of The Trip To Bountiful, you'll be happily surprised to see the voters got it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They nominated the show for best revival; John Gromada for his strong, subtle sound design; and smartly singled outCondola Rashad (who has been good in everything I've seen her in) for her sparklingturn as a young woman traveling on a bus back home to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, youwon't be surprised that Cicely Tyson was nominated for her return to Broadway after30 years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moment she walks on the stage, Tyson owns it; to me, she's thefront runner for Leading Actress In A Play, with Kristine Nielsen's even better, show-stopping turn in Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike her strongest competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like all of Horton Foote's work, the pleasures of The Trip To Bountiful (which began as a TV movie, transferred to Broadway with much the same cast and later became an Oscar-winning feature film) simply deepen and grow with the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It won't surprise me a bit if 50 or 100 years from now the two playwrights that loom largestfrom this era are August Wilson and Horton Foote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson serves up pyrotechnics andjuicy, scene-stealing monologues while Foote traffics in quiet, gentle moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butboth are deeply rooted in their very respective worlds and both write characters actorslove to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, Tyson is playing Carrie Watts, an elderly woman living with her son Ludie (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Jessie Mae his vain, difficult bride (Vanessa Williams).They're crowded together in a tiny apartment and living paycheck to paycheck. (Ludiewas sick for two years and all their savings were sucked dry.) Tempers can be short,especially because Carrie wants to return home to Bountiful, even though the town isdying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's run away a few times and made it to the train station, but Ludie alwaysfinds her and brings her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will that stop her from trying? It will not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time,Carrie heads to the bus station, meets a sweet young woman named Thelma(Condola Rashad) and they head off on their adventure together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're so used to big moments, major plot twists and the like that theater goers will probably spend much of the show anticipating dramatic turns that never arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will Carrie's heart give out? Will the sheriff in the town near Bountiful (Tom Wopat) provean ugly bigot? Will seeing Bountiful as a ghost town shatter Carrie rather than restoreher? Foote is wiser and more powerful than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He moves us without any soapopera-like shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end, you wonder why other playwrights have to do somuch to achieve so little when Foote seemingly does so little to achieve so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bountiful can break your heart -- certainly the film version emphasizes the fact that frail Carrie is accomplishing the last act of her long life when making this journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frail is not the word to describe Tyson's take on the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's feisty and endearing andindomitable -- you don't doubt for a moment she's going to get exactly where shewants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just try and stop her.May 8, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 04/30/2013 2:14 pmDirector Michael Wilson and the show takes its cue from that performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't a quiet tear-jerker; it's a warm, happy show with an emphasis on the comedy that isalways present in Foote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The early scenes with Carrie and Jessie Mae wrangling withpoor Ludie in the middle are funny rather than awkward and difficult, the way I've seen it done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This production may not aim as high as some I've seen, but it fully achieves what it sets out to do and gives a glossy, crowd-pleasing spin to what's always been seen as a more fragile, delicate piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tyson is wonderful as Carrie, whether clapping her hands and singing hymns (and convincing everyone around her to join in) or quietly taking in the beauty of a sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rashad is every bit her equal in a role that involves a lot of listening (the true sign of an actor is when they're just listening to another character but you still find them fascinating and know exactly what they're thinking at any moment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams has greatstage presence and nails this broader take on Jessie Mae with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, shewas still struggling with some of her lines on the performance I caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wasadmittedly braced for Gooding Jr. to be a disappointment in his professional stagedebut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theater ain't easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he acquitted himself nicely; he didn't wow anyone butfound his footing and delivered a modest, self-effacing performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be goodto see him at the end of the run and find out if he continues to improve withexperience; I wouldn't be surprised a bit if he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wopat brings dignity to his smallrole as the sheriff and the terrific Arthur French delivers as always as Roy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest flaw in the show is the set design by Jeff Cowie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crowded apartment at the beginning works fine -- with no wall between the living room and the bedroom, the idea of no privacy and everyone living on top of each other comes across fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bus station looks great and when we finally get to Bountiful, it has a detailed backdrop of trees and sky that is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a show. (Kudos as well to the lighting by Rui Rita.) However, that final set sadly lacked somedirt, some earth to ground Carrie in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the real problem is the scene on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sgiven a mawkish, Hallmark greeting card look with the interior of a bus surrounded bytwinkling stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's exactly the sort of heavy-handed obviousness that Footedoesn't need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't brush away the tears at the end of the show as you might on a more nuanced production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you will smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you'll definitely be glad to see Tyson backonstage and performing with all the star power she's enjoyed throughout her career.What kept her away so long? Like Carrie, if she wants to return soon to Broadway, it'shard to imagine anything standing in Tyson's way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare in the Park withLily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
