Ihave to admit, the ads have been tolerably amusing this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ruben Studdard was fine with his boilerplate r&amp;b, looking slim and telling Ryan about his upcoming tour with Clay Aiken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usher gave a killer performance of his new single...if he were appearing on So You Think You Can Dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While his moves were very good, his singing was so-so (often difficult to do when delivering an elaborate routine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I couldn't really follow Sean Combs' performance because my head was still reeling from the fact that he'd changed his moniker again from Diddy to Diddy Dirty Money MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 BIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Playboy | Movies | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World WATCH: Demi Moore In A Teeny Bikini Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Lindsay Garvey iPhone Alarm Glitch: How It Cost Me My Job Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Two House Republicans Violate Constitution With Voting Blunder BECK IN TROUBLE?

I doubt many people will argue Didi should have been saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would only make sense if you believed she were destined to make the finale and voters had made a tragic mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what about the contenders?

Maybe he used to be as big as an Airstream, and I just don't remember, but getting down to Burl Ives shape hardly constitute s a miracle success story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a reminder why Big Mike won't win...the producers won't let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ruben didn't sell any recordsand neither will Big Mike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studdard-U sher-Diddy ...OMG, shoot the audience right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And me while you're at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will look forward to seeing Didi in the movies, since she seemed to be morphing into Lauren Bacall the past couple of weeks anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Katharine McPhee, music will be something she used to getinto acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still Crystal-Ca sey-Siobha n in the final three, believing that Siobhan will get back on track and that Lee will also get back on track, on the second tier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is unkind to say about Ruben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was indeed obese and has made a significan t effort to reduce his weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who works that hard at improving himself deserves applause not ridicule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Lee "getting back on track" What does that mean? He was the blow out performanc e of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is unkind?? My point was I was a fan of Ruben, but to my eyes he did not look substantia lly different than he did 7 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Am I missing something? He still looked BIG, not "slim", and really looked the same size as Big Mike (whom Ialso wouldn't call "slim" which his name would attest to), especially in profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Howis recognizin g that constitute "ridicule" ? I just thought Ryan getting all giddy and acting like Ruben was the new Jarrod ofSubway was a bit peculiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And regarding Lee, unlike Simon, I don't think his life is going to change from that one performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal-Ca sey-Siobha n are still the ones to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My guess is Lee will revert back to his "There-are -a-million -Eddie Vedder-gro wling-sing ers-out- there" and rejoin the second tier of the competitio n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Lee on his best night has never been as good as Crystal on her worst, notthat she's had one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just we all expect less from Lee, so one is surprised whenhe isn't mediocre or boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Paltrow Dishes on Cruise Kiss Raven Symone's HugeWeight Loss Jessica Szohr's Sobe StripDown MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Natalie Portman Celebrity Body LA Shopping Video NFL Personal Health eBooks Ellen Degeneres College FootballHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »Permalink | Share it filmex 12:48 AM on 4/02/2010 Permalink | Share it anonimost 12:20 PM on 4/02/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:58 PM on 4/02/2010 Permalink | Share itNatalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During 'Black Swan' 85 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 782 Comments Animal Torture as Entertainment?

Mamasox! Mamasox! My favorite Idol contestant ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait until someone tells Big Obnoxious to keep his hand off people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usher sucked big time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Tim has a great attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He KNOWS he's not as good, and he's making sure he has fun regardless .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isn't that what we should all do? When we can't finish first, we should finish while having fun and enjoying something we may NEVER see again.And Glitz, you had me fooled for a moment on your opinion of Usher's performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It WAS BAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He should have lip-synced .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REAL BAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotcha! on Usher! I agree 100% with you about Tim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't understand why the judges actlike a cheery personalit y is some sort of crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's on national TV having fun and getting famous and enjoying himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Literally millions of people enjoy his singing enough (or justlooking at him) that they get on their phones and vote (some of course because they thinkhe's bad).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He absolutely knows he'll be gone in a week or two, so what's the big deal? "PutOn A Happy Face: A Guide To A Successful Life" by Tim Urban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, I think Tim figures he has nothing to lose so he just keeps smiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andsome people just naturally smile or laugh in uncomforta ble situations .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not going to argue with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I agree, the judges have to give their critiques butwhy make such a big deal out of it when he nervously laughs at himself? They actamazed that "he just doesn't get it." Sure, he gets it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knows he doesn't havestar singing talent, so why not just hang in as long as you can, keep on smilingand see what happens.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POSTcardiaccare 08:33 PM on 4/01/2010 Permalink | Share it LCDTV 06:05 PM on 4/01/2010 Permalink | Share it stratdude 05:44 PM on 4/01/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER RhiannonRings 04:42 PM on 4/01/2010 Permalink | Share it Burnsey 03:37 PM on 4/01/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 09:47 PM on 4/01/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Don Parker 02:31 AM on 4/02/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER 52 Fans 59 Fans 52 FansWhy are you assuming Siobhan was in the bottom four? They always stage drama and everyone knew she hadn't done as well last night, so they lined her up with Katie to up the drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But beforelast night Siobhan had been the one who brought it every week and wowed the crowd and thejudges so I really doubt that she was the fourth lowest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why aren't you saying Andrew was in the bottom four? They also staged the drama with him and Tim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor do I assume Katie necessaril y received more votes than Tim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, it's all about the drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All we know (or do we?) is that Didi was voted off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim should have been sent home long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine how he made the top 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, but Tim is so "adorable. " It's hard to imagine Katie, Aaron, Andrew, or Tim making the final five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But depending on how wellthey bring it each week from now on, Siobhan, Crystal, Michael, Lee, or Casey could win it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And ofcourse, we'll never know for sure what moves the voters to keep someone going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lilly and Katelyn,both long gone, for instance, were better than some of those who still remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drama goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're quite right: unless Ryan specifical ly says "these two were only separated by only 10,000 votes" or some such comment, we can't assume anything about their ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We only know the bottom three for certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim should have been gone before, but how and when people leave is somewhat random; we know who we think will be going in the nextfew weeks and they all probably will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The order isn't so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's a lot to besaid about making the Top 4; that's what matters since they get a lot more visibility and abetter shot at a career.And of course making the finals is the real guarantee of doing atleast two or three albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll bet Tim gets an acting gig at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Probably several of them can have at least a minor career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ones who havesome personalit y, a reasonably good voice, and good looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a good singing/pe rforming coach and a manager who plays up the American Idol connection , maybe lands them on some minor TV shows, even regional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't keep up with the pop music scene much, but I like Idol because of thehuman drama and the individual stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I haven't really followed any of the previous ones who finished low in the top ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like there's thousands of writers making a good living without ever having a best seller, I'm guessing that there are tons of singers out there doing okay, making a good living, traveling the circuit, cutting a few CDs now and then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you know if any of the lower ten have continued on with much success?
