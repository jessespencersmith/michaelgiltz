                <p>His favo Nat an Lane involves Sondheim, London's est End, injuries, Terrence McNal ly, Broadway's movie calle e Producers By Michael Giltzike Superman, actor Nathan Lane hirs been coming to the rescue throughout 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First he rewrote the book on Stephen Sondheim's long-neglected mrsical The Frogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he dashed off to London's West End at a moment's notice to open The Producers-to massive acclaim, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bum knee led to a bad back and a brief respite back in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he filmed the mone ver- sion of The Producers and tried to rest again But a longtime friend, playwright Terrence McNally, needed a last-minute lead actor for his new play, and Lane responded heroically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led right into a revival of The Odd Couple on Broadway 60 I January 17, 2006 www.advocate com THE ADVOCATEthat's the biggest hit since. . .The Produc- ers When you're hot, you're hot Obviously it's been a very good year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Terrence McNally play, filmingThe Producers, and now The Odd Couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year has its ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does 2005 seem like a particularly good year for you? I don't know I just keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't turn around and look at it and say lin a slightly plummy tonel,'qlVell, this was a good year." It has certainly been busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I finished [my revival of the Sondheim mu- sicall The -F'rogg and I got this phone call from [director Susan] Stroman ro go ro London because things weren't going &gt;PERFORMANCE well to open lThe Producersl there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I had a torn meniscus in the left knee, which required surgery, but they said I could get through on just physical therapy while I was doing the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then my back went out because I was compensating for the knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I was in enormous pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I le{t a couple of weeks early, and I came back and had the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Six weeks later I was frlming "Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop." So it was a whirlwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was three months or four months or whatever it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I went out to Long Is- land to finally lie down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then Terrence lost the actor who was going to play the lead in Dedication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was so depressed-and again it was moments before they were about to open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I said llaughingl, "Well...I'll do it." And then I said, 'lMho said that?" Anyway, it tumed out to be a really good thing for the both of us, and it was great to work together again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it certainly helped hirn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a really great experience that I was back in a re- hearsal room with him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the outside, the impression was that you and Terrence had had a falling-out and had been estranged for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, his work is always good, so it wasn't the work that brought you two back together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What was it? That was long past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We certainly had been friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasdt like we weren't friends, and then we did this, and now we were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were having dinner together when this all came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other stuff has been overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I said, "I1l doou as an i] -Nathan Lane it," it meant a great deal to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, I think it did heal some- thtng...|nuShsl that I thoughtwas healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's even more healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It s even more healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did do something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It rneant a great deal to hirn, so I'm doubly glad I did it. l've no doubt you and Matthew Broderick are delighted by the attention and the sales, but I get the impression from the outside that it's got to be exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People are expecting sliced bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You two have done two shows together, and I think it was The New York Times that 62 | January 17, 2006 www advocate.com TH E ADVOCATEI Ireferred to your legendary rapport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought surely you should have to do at least l0 shows together before you can be burdened with having a legendary rapport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What can you do? You don't have any control over expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were as shocked as anyone-the fact that it sold out before we went into rehearsals was rather extraordinary and unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's exciting, but you get a little nauseous thinking about how there will be a lot of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next year you'll do The Gin Game together. lLauehsl Oh, Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, I think we'll take a vacation for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the mainstream media profiles there were a few that made you seem very...solitary, melancholy, sad on the outside because you cry on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, that s all a lot ofhorseshit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wondered if you recognized that or thought, Who are they talking about? That's what they decided I had no vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look, a lot of that stems from this article in The New Yorh Times Magazine that Alex Witchel did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've known her for years, and I like Alex, and she's a good writer, and it's a well-written article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The one thing we'd joke about is that I'd say, "Whatever you do, don't turn this into the sad-clown article." But you have to live with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People take their cues from that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many articles have decided she must have gotten it right It gets to be a little much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not saying I'm not a complicat- ed person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm not clinically de- pressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time magazine had an article onThe Odd Couple, and one passage was so awkwardly worded that they made it sound like you were currently dating Victor Garber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Victor's one of my best friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That whole piece- again, you're sometimes a victim of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a guy [the reporter] who showed up in our dressing room-my dressing room-and Matthew and I are sitting there, and talk about clinically de- pressed, he came in and sat down like this was the last place he wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said, 'You know, I'm the book guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't usually do entertainment." I said, "Oh, OK." He said, "The last piece I did was Joan Didion." I said, "Well, we're a little funnier than Joan Didion." So he said, "So tell me something: What is this 'previews' thine?"lLaughingl No, no, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not lying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not making this up. 'lVhat is this'previews' thing?' I said,'TVelI, before we open, we're getting warmed up." And then he said, '1 guess this Joe Mantello, he's done a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I should have heard ofhim, huh?" I said, 'Where have you been?" So anyhow, in the middle of this conversation-because we're doing Thp Odd Couple, and its about divorce-he said, 'Well, to tell you the truth, ifs a little sad because I just got divorced." And I thought, She mo.de the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then the article comes out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's been this whole Lhing, "Time magazine wants to write an article on you!" I spent an hour with this gentleman, and the article he writes- he decided that yes, again, emotionally I was Zelda Fitzgerald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he referred to Matthew and me as B-list performers who'd had no success beforc The Producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you think, WeIl, why did they want us to star in it? llawhsl Anway, you have to live with it until it winds up in some dentists office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And during the run you'll turn 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, yes, that's right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does that matter to you? ls it exciting? Sure Now there's a time to look back and say, Well? It's been pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm plan- ning a big party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've rented the Rainbow Room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'll be a nice celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think You came allthe way out officially in The Advocate, which we certainly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wondered if I could compare it to getting mar- ried for people who've been living together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're already basically married, but then they say the words, and it means something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How have things been since that final step? Initially, it didn't have a huge impact- Everyone in your life knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It didn't feel like I'd been hiding anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once you say, "I don't want to talk about my private life," that means you're gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, sometimes it has an impact that I don't feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe some young person looking at some- one successful-if it helps someone, you'd like to think you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But honestly, it didn't change anything for me other than that it was in a magazine and it was official And then you have to live with "openly gay actor Nathan Lane." It's better than "the private Nathan Lane." Or "the sad clown."
