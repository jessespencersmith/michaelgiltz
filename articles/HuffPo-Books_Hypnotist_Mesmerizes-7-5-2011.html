(Rest assured, we'll hear about it in detail.) Bark is addicted to painkillers and not sleepingwith his beautiful wife, who hasn't forgiven him for a brief affair many years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their son is alsowounded in a way: he suffers from a rare blood disease that means he must get weekly injections and canstill die if jostled around too casually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boy is finally dating a goth girl, who seems to be trying to pullaway from a gang of aimless youth that terrorize the kids in their neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But are his parent tooprotective to let him have any fun? When Bark is reluctantly pressured into using hypnosis in this crisis situation, you won't be surprised to hear it all spirals out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The madman who attacked that family is revealed and on the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Themissing sister is found but never feels safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bark's use of hypnosis makes national news and AmnestyInternational weighs in on his barbaric tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then the hypnotist's son is kidnapped and any one ofseveral terrifying suspects could be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon we're plunged back into the past and Bark'scontroversial group hypnosis therapy sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He brought together all sorts of damaged souls, one ofwhom may be targeting him now for the sins of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all pretty entertaining stuff, though regular readers of mysteries won't be thrown off by the red herrings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, herring served at a Christmas party and unusual street names are the only clues thatthis is set in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either world culture is becoming unified or this book is geared towards a worldaudience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly disaffected teens and psychopaths are the same the world over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few missteps aresoon brushed aside. (Early on, when a psycho has vowed to kill Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bark and/or his family, wouldn't thecops simply go to Bark's home rather than just leave some frantic phone messages and leave it at that?)It's lean, amiable beach reading with Linna not quite center stage (much of the book is devoted to Barkand others) but an interesting character nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has one annoyingly endearing quirk: Linna isalways right and when he's doubted and proven right, he feels compelled to make his coworkers admit hewas right and then says, "I told you so." When this book becomes a bestseller and we get a sequel, just take it for granted that I'm thinking the same thing: I was right and I told you so. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz was provided with a free copy of this book in galley and final form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He receives farmore books than he can cover and does not guarantee to review or write about any particular one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Sponsored Links 57 Year Old Mom Looks 27 Huffington Post Readers: Mom Reveals $5 Wrinkle Trick Angering Doctors MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?
