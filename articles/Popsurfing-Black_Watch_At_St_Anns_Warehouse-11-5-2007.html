Director John Tiffany makes full use of the space, with actorsroaring about from one end to the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A constantly shiftingperspective has actors up in the scaffolding at one moment followed byothers across the room on the ground at the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scenes flowseamlessly into one another, costume changes sometimes take place infull view, and something as simple as three men leaning back in theirchairs and slamming down onto the ground in unison can be quietlymesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two especially vivid moments stick out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first was thescene of soldiers reading letters from home (one after another readsmutely, lets their letter fall to the ground and then begins to perform insign language what they're feeling or what they've read or what theywant to say in response).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other was an extendedsequence in which our hero details the history of Scotland's BlackWatch, all while being dressed and undressed in the uniforms of thatfabled unit from the very beginning to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The speaker is liftedup and turned over and bent backwards by others and clothed andNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "Black Watch" At St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehousehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/11/black-watch-at-st-anns... 1 of 37/25/09 11:54 AMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SMichael in New YorkBiboyAaron POPSURFING.COM: "Black Watch" At St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehousehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/11/black-watch-at-st-anns... 2 of 37/25/09 11:54 AMPOPSURFING.COM: "Black Watch" At St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehousehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/11/black-watch-at-st-anns... 3 of 37/25/09 11:54 AM</p>
