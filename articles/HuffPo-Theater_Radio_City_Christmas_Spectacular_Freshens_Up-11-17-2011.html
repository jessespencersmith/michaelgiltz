"The Twelve Days Of Christmas" is happily presented as a dance number so you needn't hear most of the lyrics until close to the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it has an odd arrangement for the first few verses that is almost EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; November 24, 2011 What Are They Eating For Thanksgiving?

It's easy to just glide by these pieces but they're key to the show."Wooden Soldiers" in particular is a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They feature the precision dancing of the Rockettes, who work hard at making this seem easy for the four or five shows a day they perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The choreography even adds in a soldier in the back scurrying into place to give the automaton nature of the piece a humantouch so you can appreciate all the more what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bus tour of New York City for the Rockettes follows, with people ice skating and the like on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The choreography fades a bit here; surely more could be done with the Rockettes on a tour bus than we see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or perhaps I was distracted by the constant stream of product placements which began during Santa's 3- D ride and proved overwhelming here, from New York Life and Madison Square Gardens to seeing aChase bank on seemingly every street corner. (Come to think of it, maybe that's just done for the sake ofrealism.) A modest storyline is introduced with a mother frantic to find a "Jumping Jasmine" doll for her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Santa (a solid Charles Edward Hall) knows what they really need is quality time and whisks the two off to the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set piece is busy and confusing with no real focus as mother and daughter help the elves load presents for the big holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes and choreography and busy set get in the way ofeach other here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is unfortunately followed by the show's newest attraction and its low-point: "Santa's Video Game." Instead of say, baking cookies or doing some charity work or caroling or some other low-tech enterprise, Santa gets the two to play a video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OK, that's sharing time with your kid, so it's not such a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But few things are as dull as watching other people play a video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one involves rescuingpresents from the castle of the Humbugs, not that you'd care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The animation is more detailed andconvincing than in the first short, but creatively it's a flop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a deadly dull segment, we don 3-D glasses and watch the two work their way up level after level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because the game presumably features the Rockettes battling the Humbugs, they're placed onstage between the players and the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That meansthat the 3-D is downplayed so as not to spoil the effect of thinking the Rockettes are actually in the video game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But of course that makes you wonder why the heck you're wearing the 3-D glasses in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, the desired effect of making it look like the Rockettes have entered the game a la Tron simply doesn't come off in the least, not that the segment would be improved creatively if it had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then themother steps aside to sing a patented generic holiday tune called "Closer Than You Know/I Knew." In all, this probably takes 10 minutes; it stalls the energy of the show -- though not fatally -- and really should be removed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, things barrel towards the climax with a big sing-along celebrating the holiday followed by "The Living Nativity" framed as the mother reading the Gospel story to her daughter, which makes it feel MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
