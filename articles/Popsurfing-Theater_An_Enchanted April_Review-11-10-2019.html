                <p>SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2019 THEATER: "Enchanted April" -- The Charming Tale That Cannot Fail (Much) AN ENCHANTED APRIL ** 1/2 out of **** THEATRE ROW It's 1922 and four women -- four strangers, really -- impulsively find themselves renting the castle San Salvatore on the coast of theMediterranean for the month of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A castle? For theentire month of April? Sunshine? And wisteria? They all have their reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lotty is a timid soul but when she spots an ad offering a castle for rent she somehow gins up the nerve toapproach another woman in her club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've never spoken despiteattending the same church on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lotty plants the idea and her friend Rose Arbuthnot tries to resist but then suggests maybe simply writing for the particulars wouldn't be so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before you know it,they're advertising for roomies to share the expense and up pop thedour Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fisher and the glamorous Lady Caroline Dester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They alldecamp to Italy and the romantic setting conjures up the usual magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The women blossom, become friends, romances are begun or rekindled with loved ones and it truly is enchanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the essential plot of The Enchanted April by Elizabeth von Arnim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was published in 1922, between the wars and is the sort of light comic novel the British do better than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, as far as I can tell, no one else even tries to write these sorts of books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'ssweet, perceptive, very funny in the kindest and most charming sort ofway and well why not say it...enchanting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One hundred years havecome and gone and I can recommend it unreservedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been turned into a play several times, a radio play, a few musicals and two feature films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most recent movie is perhaps the mostpopular adaptation of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That 1991 film was nominated for an Oscarand tweaked the story ever so slightly, as most adaptations can and must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joan Plowright was especially good as the starchy Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FisherMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (86) ▼ November (6) BOOKS: Is Finance The Root Of All Evil?and really you can't beat the Mediterranean for sumptuous settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here it comes again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You really can't go wrong with this story and the romantic idea of an Italian vacation to stir the soul. (E.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forsterpulled the same trick with A Room With A View. ) I'm not sure why but they've changed the title to An Enchanted April, which seems more random and annoying than the 1991 film insisting on just EnchantedApril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, the book changes by Elizabeth Hansen are reasonable choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the original novel, Rose Arbuthnot is unforgivably religious and finds her husband's career as a popular writer churning out biographies of royal mistresses distasteful and embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also mentions they lost a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Hansen downplays the Puritanismand gives Rose a sad monologue about her guilt over the little boy'sdeath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the novel, the impossibly beautiful Lady Dester is just bored of being chased by every man alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try as she might to be dismissive or rude, everyone is charmed by her every utterance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, she ishaughty, which is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's also haunted by the recent horrors of thewar, where Lady Caroline worked as a nurse and saw her share ofsuffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many ways, she is suffering from PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those changes lead to some other modest plot changes but it's all fine and good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four women come to Italy, clash a little, loosen up and take a plunge intonewer and better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big problem is the score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Perry did the music and he and Hansen tackle the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all recitative tunes, with aimless, meandering melodic lines, the sort of thing people think of as a laStephen Sondheim though of course Sondheim always offers greatmelodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You rarely get anything approaching a proper song, justvocalizing about the lovely view or this and that from a modestly voiced cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wouldn't matter that most of the performers are not belters if they had some charming tunes to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But alas, theflowers bloom but the songs do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This being a musical, that is afatal flaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story rescues things, as it always does, along with two standouts.THEATER: Good Intentions No Substitute For Good Me...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This could be ditzy or silly or jokey but Hocking makesLotty irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alma Cuervo is costumed to echo Plowright to a t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, her performance is not a carbon copy but Cuervo's own thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though why they felt the need to have her slam her cane to the groundand shout "Brilliant" at the very end is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was hardly acatch phrase of hers and simply underlined the lack of oomph fromthe finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a very modest budget, the women were costumed nicely by Matthew Solomon, though I doubt Lady Caroline would have worn aflapper costume to any dinner at the castle and Jim Stanek's suit could have been a little more period appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little dab of Brylcreem (or rather its precursor since that came out in 1928) would havehelped him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The idea of white umbrellas serving as a backdrop wasfine and the sets by William Armstrong did the job despite very fewresources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music was provided by two players though here again the musical choices were unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better just two pianos instead of having one chintzily try to echo the sound of strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, for a brief moment it all works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fisher sings "This Feeling," a song about a tingle of excitement and pleasure she hasn'texperienced since her youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better than any other tune, it reveals character and pushes the plot forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cuervo makes the most of it,the song approaches a melody and for a moment you forget the modestbackdrop, the performer and just get caught up in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisfeeling doesn't happen very often, but it's a treat when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
