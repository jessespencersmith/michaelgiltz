(See "Who's the King of Late Nite? Craig Ferguson!" ) In fact, a gift from a good friend last year was a trip to Nashville to see Ferguson record this very stand-up act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We had a great time, though you won't see Ferguson at his best here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is fairly standard material here, though Ferguson is such a genial figure, he wins you over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eddie Izzard he isn't, when it comes to stand-up, but hardcore fans like me will want to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of you should start watching or DVRing his show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check my earlier piece for a rundown of what makes him so special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What astonishes me now (and bums me out) is his skeleton robot sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hated the sidekick idea because I wanted to be his chubby white male sidekick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then when the robot appeared he was stiff and awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they kept fiddling and fiddling and slowly hit gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly Geoff Peterson was a classic sidekick -- gay, sometimes drunk, and bitter; he and Ferguson play off each other wonderfully in banter that is presumably scripted but comes across as loose and off the cuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They makeinventive use of Geoff's many voices (cheesy ad voiceover guy, mawkish Vegas-y showman, MorganFreeman, etc.) and most importantly Geoff is very very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also a scathing satire of sidekicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to imagine anyone else ever wanting to be a sidekick again after Geoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then, I might have thought the same thing after Jeffrey Tambor's Hank from The Larry Sanders Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAD TEACHER ($40.99 BluRay combo or $30.99 DVD; Sony) -- Like Bridesmaids , this was an inexplicably successful comedy and yet I'm happy for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Segal has been a favorite since F&amp;G (good luke with The Muppets , dude!), Justin Timberlake continues to grow as an actor and Cameron Diaz can be very funny and needed a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So did director Jake Kasdan, who has quirkier and better instincts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the pretty good trailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GUNS OF NAVARONE ($19.99; Sony) -- Director J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee Thompson made almost 50 films and had two very good years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1962, he made Cape Fear with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One year earlier he stepped into the troubled production of The Guns of Navarone, righted the ship and turned out a big hit. (Peck dubbed him Mighty Mouse on that set.) The film is firmly in the tradition of quests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anoddball, ragtag team is brought together to achieve an impossible quest: go behind enemy lines and blowup key, long-range Nazi guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a little lumbering, a little stodgy, a little obvious but boy it's fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peck, David Niven and Anthony Quinn lead the cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

Would it take on the corruption that resulted in buildings so shoddy that they simply collapsed likepancakes? No, they would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A resolutely mainstream, rather tepid drama, it politely uses the devastating 1976 earthquake in Tangshan as a backdrop for a family saga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aftershocks are theJimi Hendrix Named Greatest Guitarist Of All...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Wagner: Murder Suspect On 'NCIS' Daniel Radcliffe Almost Wasn't Harry Potter 'Community': Beetlejuice Secret Easter Egg In Halloween...emotional damages felt by the survivors: in this case, a mother filled with guilt, a son who lost his arm and a daughter who felt abandoned and unloved and was taken in by a foster family that thought she was an orphan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The situation is wrenching but the presentation is so middle of the road and obvious that very little resonates emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This may be a step forward: China can make dull Oscar bait just ascompetently as the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor direction but boy, some of the crowd scenes are impressive; you sure can get cheap day players to work your film when your country contains one billion people and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now tell me, what is TV's greatest family drama of all-time?
