(photo by Sandra Coudert)In Paraffin , it's the same hallway on the night of a New York City blackout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Apps (charming as the Russian) is now a drug addict whose own wife (a top-notch Julianne Nicholson) locks him out of herapartment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's being menaced by thugs who want their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The super of the first play (GuyBoyd) is now a tenant, an older gay man who picks up a rent boy and buys the kid sneakers but tries tokid himself that it's a romantic date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also looking after the bitter paralyzed war veteran Lucas (Jeremy Strong -- so good in New Jerusalem and good again here, especially if you want to see him exposed in every way possible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the unfortunate Nursing , it's the same hallway but now the building is a museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disease has been eradicated apparently in 2053.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for educational purposes, some people are paid to be infected with horrors like the black death and suffer and vomit for paying customers until they are cleansed and theninfected again in a few days or weeks with some new virulent nastiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why this would be staged in thehallway of a lower east side tenement instead of one of the many now-useless hospitals that would be TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Emma Watson Wants Outof Brown, Not College LeAnn Rimes' Ex Responds to Wedding News Zach Braff's New Role: Drug Dealer Robert De Niro To GOP, Donald Trump: 'How Dare You!'

Why does the best friend of the drugaddict's wife fail to tell her the pretty crucial information that a menacing thug who knows where shelives is going to chop her husband into a million little pieces? Why does a teacher and former lover whotracks down Lloyd to this museum seem surprised by what's going on -- especially if he's become nationalnews? If you want to infect the world with disease, why would you head to the atomic wasteland ofCalifornia? Again and again, the honestly earned fascination we have with these characters is undermined by what the Emperor in Amadeus called "too many notes." Each play flirts with cliche, yet develops strong distinctive people and then swamps them by the end with far more melodrama than is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The complaints come pouring out because you feel Rapp was so close to elevating his game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And don't let thecomplaints distract you -- the first two plays are one of the best bargains around town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dollar for dollaryou'll see some of the best acting possible in two enjoyable works by a playwright who some day is goingto aim for the fences and hit one way past them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS zero stars out of **** Mother Of Invention at Theatre Row's Studio Theatre Is there anything more distressing than being onstage and forgetting your lines? Yes, being in the audience when someone is onstage and forgetting their lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like being a parent who has to watchtheir kid compete -- it's a lot easier to try and fail than sit on the sidelines and suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't makeit any easier for Gina Stahlnecker, who plays the lead role in this moribund Tennessee Williams play.She's a pushy beautician who bosses around everyone in sight, shoots her mouth off and generally acts asa life force waking up the denizens of a seedy little bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One is her lunk of a boyfriend, another is adrunken and washed-up doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's the ditzy broad who might just be nuts for real and so on.You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Losers with dreams or at least losers who once had dreams or at least knew people who had dreams.

Kendrick Jones -- so good in The Scottsboro Boys -- is an old school hoofer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His singing was adequate but his dancing on "I'm Just Wild About Harry" and "Everybody Step" was electric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones was born in the wrong era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eighty years ago he would have been a star and worked steadily; every show could use a dancer like him to comein, wow the crowd with a specialty number and maybe take part in a comic bit or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liz Lark Brown didwell by two novelty numbers but "My Man" was a tad too big for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two stars of Yank! -- coming to Broadway soon -- stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director/choreographer Jeffry Denham charmed on two numbers, especially when he played his ukulele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You gotta have a ukulele when you're doing songs from 1921.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the marvelous Bobby Steggert was playfully innocent on the duet "Just Like You" with Erin Denman and then meltingly good on "Dolly." Siegel does one show a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, March 21 he tackles the Broadway Musicals of 1932.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After this show, I wouldn't want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 2010-2011 THEATER SEASON (ratings on a four star system) Angels in America revival at Signature *** out of **** Blood From A Stone ** 1/2 The Broadway Musicals Of 1921 at Town Hall *** Devil Boys From Beyond ** The Diary Of A Madman with Geoffrey Rush at BAM ***Driving Miss Daisy ** Elf * Elling ** A Free Man Of Color ** 1/2 Gatz *** The Grand Manner ** The Great Game *** Gruesome Playground Injuries *** The Hallway Trilogy: Nursing **The Hallway Trilogy: Paraffin ***The Hallway Trilogy: Rose ***The Importance Of Being Earnest ** 1/2 The Interminable Suicide Of Gregory Church *** 1/2 John Gabriel Borkman * 1/2 La Bete ** 1/2 Les Miserables *** Lombardi **Lil B's 'I'm Gay' Album Title Results...
