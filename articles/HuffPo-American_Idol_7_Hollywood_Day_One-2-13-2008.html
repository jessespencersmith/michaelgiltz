Frankly, she was terrific and went through to the final day but I think the musiccovered up a few rough patches vocally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She still seems too tentative to go far but should at leastmake it to next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hernandez -- began the Stephen Stills tune "Love The One You're With" in a nicely slowed down manner before picking up speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sounded very impressive but -- darn you, Mariah Carey -- he seems incapable of singing an entire line of the song without throwing in some "run" orvariation on the melody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could be a problem down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amanda Overmyer -- the rock chick with the white streaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first of many contestants to have major drama to offer up for viewers, in her case a serious car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broken ribs? Bah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amanda -- looking as confident as ever -- belted out "Light My Fire" by The Doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very, verystrong (final 12 for sure) but Simon was right when he said Amanda doesn't show a lot of variety.That's fine as a performer, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't go to see Janis Joplin in concert and expect to heara Celine Dion ballad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on the show, when contestants have to tackle different genres every week,versatility is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Amanda has more tricks up her rock chick sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

"Light My Fire"/"Everything I Do (I Do It For You)"/"Sway" -- 164 contestants. 200 songs to choose from at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet 40% of them seemed to choose the Bryan Adams song, 25% the Doors and the rest the standard "Sway." Urgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think how happy the judges will be to not hear the same song again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Josiah Leming -- the 18 year old kid living in his car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has his family contacted him yet? Or are we saving that footage for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Josiah is very appealing (if weepy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he gets to the final 12, he'll get through a number of rounds just because people won't want to see him cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also talented despite that hilarious British accent he affects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had my doubts but his first performance of Mika's "Grace Kelly" was very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought it was a bad choice because of all the falsetto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he was great, which made his later meltdown on "Stand By Me" so confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hardly seems capable of being "difficult" and was always hyper-polite but Josiah for some reason couldn't work with the band to get an arrangement of the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vocal coach told him what he refused to do but I didn't quite follow anything other than the idea that he didn't know how to work with the band or was just too freaked out and tired to do it properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They clearly gave him every chance but he then smartly thanked the band and asked them to leave the stage. hey, if you don't like thearrangement, why keep the band? A pity he did such a terrible job on the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUt sincepersonality matters more than the judges would like to admit when it comes to picking the final 12,they all said he was terrible but would make it through to the final 24 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? Othercontestants must have been thinking, damn, I should have lived in my car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny Noriega -- one of many contestants we met before but barely got a glimpse of in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's always hard to tell if the producers decided these people won't make it or just go through smoothly and therefore don't offer any drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presumably a drama major himself, Dannysounded good in the brief moment we saw him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blue lollipops -- was someone handing out treats backstage? There was an outbreak of blue tongues during some of the auditions, so clearly something was being passed around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kyle Ensley -- the geeky guy playing the Clay Aiken card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No idea why he got to Hollywood (though he seems like an amiable guy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's dreadful the first time and then sings Josh Groban the second time and to me sounded like the male equivalent of a beauty contestant (gets through the song and hits some notes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the judges were impressed? I don't get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he makes it through the final 12, it will have nothing to do with his singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorry, Kyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angela Martin -- the single mom with the ill daughter, we find out her father hasn't just died but been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In season one, wasn't it Justin Guarini whose mom went into the hospital and theykept it a secret because he didn't want it to influence voters? Oh, how the producers have changedtheir tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta -- the 16-year-old Tiger Beat cover boy of the future (and by future I mean three months from now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Totally adorable in an aw shucks way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How can you not like someone who talks about "that tingly feeling" he gets when an audition goes well..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the jduges want toadopt him and so will all of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sang "Heaven" by Bryan Adams, which I thought would betoo old and slow for him but he sang it confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Desperately looking for something to critique, Iwould point out his awkwardness not on stage but with his hands, which he kept using in a goofytheatrical manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, at the moment he looks a lock for the finale. (Silly to say that at this stage,of course, but boy he looks good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only possible weakness: the different genres and new songs hewill prsumably have never heard.) Syesha Mercado -- very cute contestant who struggled all week with a hoarse voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She nailed Aretha's "Chain Of Fools" to say the least and also looks like a lock for the final 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very, very strong contestant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Johns -- the raspy voiced dude who sang "Bohemian Rhapsody," which was another terrible idea (I thought) until he delivered a really confident rendition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's three contestants in a row that are not just locks for the final 12 but look like serious contenders for the final prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year, Ryan Seacrest breathlessly tells us that "the talent is stronger than ever." (I'd like to see the season where he says, "the talent is a little weak this year."

Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink If I was gonna place a bet today, I'd put my money on him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UK version of Idol (The X Factor) has had a number of teens who fit the image we sort of expected Idol to celebrate allalong - wholesome teeny boppers that girls swoon over -- and they've done really well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top 5? I'd bet major money on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a few possible weak points include his awkward hand gestures and the fact that he's 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't keep him from being poised (he sure is) butsimply not knowing most of the songs he'll have to choose from can be ahuge hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Songsthat even people in their 20s know well because they've had some years to hear a lot of pop music are just mysterious titles to him and learning a new song in a day or two is really really hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he has a gift for that, but it is a potential weak point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey he seems like a winner the way carrie Underwood always did so we have to come up with some hurdles for him toovercome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!
