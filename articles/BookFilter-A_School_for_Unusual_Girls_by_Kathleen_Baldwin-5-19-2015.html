Unfortunately, thisopener has numerous problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One, there's precious little training that goes on: Georgina shows up, invents a newundetectable invisible ink that might just save her country in 48 hours ("It can't be done!" "I've done it!") and is off onan assignment before you blink an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, dashes of mild, unnecessary magic (like other students who havevisions, commune with animals and so on) is both intrusively present but not developed enough to actually feelgermane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, romance is rather obviously handled, with Georgina and a beau inevitably frustrated by and drawnto each other within one minute of meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would all be forgettable in other hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But author Kathleen Baldwinhas a deft hand and one has the sense she really could deliver a corker of a novel with more discipline, more focusand less lazy plotting. (I really dislike period novels in which characters prematurely invent flying gliders or machinesjust as an easy way to achieve a goal.) Baldwin can dash off readable pages; here's hoping any success this haspushes her to aim higher next time. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“A School for Unusual Girls sucked me in from the first few pages and kept me reading until late into the night.Kathleen Baldwin has created a completely original—and totally engrossing—world, full of smart girls, handsomeboys, and sinister mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who wouldn't want to enroll?” —Meg Cabot, bestselling author of The Princess Diaries “Spellbinding! A School for Unusual Girls is a beautifully written tale of adventure, intrigue, and romance that willappeal to every girl who has ever felt different….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A true page-turner!” —Rachel Hawthorne, NYT and USA Todaybestselling author of Trouble from the StartWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
