                <p>,aVllrSICJn therapv." honorable death"). and has given countless media interviews, Barker's sexual orientation has so far surfaced only in a round of gayÂ­ press interviews published a year ago to herald his film Lord of Illusions. "I think it is strange itwas never more of an issue," says the 44-year-old Liverpool native. "People came to the house, people met my lover, met my best friend, saw this was an all-male household .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they never mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never even asked the question." That should change with Sacrament(HarperCollins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barker's most personal novel yet, which focuses on gay wildlife photographer Will Rabjohns, takes AIDS-devastated San Francisco as a central setting, and is dedicated to Barker's lover, Malcolm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the novel has moments of gore and hints of magic, its driving force is an overarching psychological tension, that deep sense of unease that's been Barker's trademark since his first short story collection, 1984's Books of Blood: Volume One (which also included a tale with a gay protagonist) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the forces of evil his imagination continues to muster, Barker's new novel clearly signals movement away from the early despair of the Books of Blood series to a real sense of optimism. "Sacramentis a redemptive story," he says. "And even though it plunges very deeply into the things that give me anxiety as a human being living in an increasingly spoiled world, I do think there's plenty of light at the end of this tunnel." Working in genres not known for their social conscience Â­ gory books, horror films, fantasy epics-Barker uses his pop platform to take on the big issues: man's destruction of life on Earth in Sacrament, racism and homelessness in the film Candyman, the poverty of the American imagination in his novel The Great and Secret Show. "One of the things that horror does is deliberately address issues in a very extreme form," he says. "So it's kind of aversion therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You getto look at these things in an extreme form and, yes, in a safe situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think movies in that sense can be quite therapeutic ; they can strengthen your antibodies where this stuff is concerned ." At least one ofthe frightening themes of Sacrament-the ravages of disease-continues to play out in the author's own life. "All of us live with the notion that we are frail and that we are transforming," he says. "My father contracted leukemia six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know, there's my dad-the cornerstone of my life-and here is this thing which is in his body and part of him, doing its vicious thing." (His father is currently in remission.) Not your average paperback writer, Barker is also an artistwho has exhibited his paintings at major galleries and illustrated a number of his own stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's now editing a second collection of his plays (titled Forms of Heaven) and keeping an eye on Paramount Pictures' animated production of his children's book The Thief of -~ Always. "I think it's importantto hold on to the 19-year-old inside who says, 'I can do that: because you don't know until you try," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With that in mind, he's juggling story ideas that may take him into science fiction and erotica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As is evident in Sacrament, where gay sex is part ofthe natural terrain, a respectforthe sensual has always been a part of his work. "Sex and arousal is one of the places where our minds look atthe world with a kind of clarity," says Barker. "It's one of the places in our regular lives, our normal lives, where we get a sense of holiness."-MICHAEL G ILTZ Michael Giltz has contributed to Entertainment Weekly and New York. 48 SEPTEMBER 1996 OUT</p>
