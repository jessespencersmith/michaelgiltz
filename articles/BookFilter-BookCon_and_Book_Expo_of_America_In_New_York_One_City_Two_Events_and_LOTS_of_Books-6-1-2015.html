Pshaw! They've got a much better book about that.The BEA is where the publishing industry talks to itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Editors and writers and publicists and librarians andbookstore owners and marketers all get together and take casual meetings and attend panels and go cheer onauthors so they can jazz each other up about the many books just out or coming up this summer and fall.BookCon is where the publishing industry talks to the world, offering more panels (but FUN ones) and authorsignings and movie screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like ComicCon's smarter kid brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a big star at both of them is JohnGreen, the best-selling author of The Fault In Our Stars and Looking For Alaska and Paper Towns, which hasbeen turned into a movie that opens July 24th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Green chatted with BookFilter and seemed positively abashedabout having no new book on the horizon but perked up considerably when talking about the movie and publiceducation and his passion for soccer. (For those not following the FIFA scandal, "Blatter" is the name of thehead of that troubled org.) Check it out:And here's the trailer to the movie.If you haven't read Paper Towns, don't fear -- it's virtually cancer free and filled with witty dialogue teens onlywish they could spout out on command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Green's a rock star because he does naturally what so many authorsare attempting: using social media to stay in touch with their fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It works for Green because he's not doing it topromote his books; he's doing it because he loves it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check out his website, and Crash Course, terrific onlinevideos about history and math and science and literature and more, all designed to be great resources forstudents, teachers and anyone who wants to learn something fun. (Anyone, that is, except the Mongols.) Johnand his brother Hank created it and have now partnered with PBS and hope to make educational resourcesavailable for free to everyone around the world.As you can see, Green's multi-media career is going full bore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But BookCon is just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bigComic-Cons reach more than 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year was the second edition of BookCon and they're hopingto hit 15,000 to 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet with care and smart moves, the sky is the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book tours have becomeincreasingly difficult for publishers to fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So instead of sending out each other individually, why not bring thefans to them? I can easily imagine BookCons on the east and west coast, north and south some four times ayear: every season has great books, every season a big movie or TV show linked to a book is getting launchedor enjoying a new season, and every big name author like Judy Blume and Stephen King and David Sedaris andDiana Gabaldon and John Grisham and yes John Green can draw passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With them as anchors, a lotof newer authors these name brands respect and support can reach tons of fans all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brien McDonald,the show manager of BookCon 2015 for ReedPOP talked with me about what was happening at this year'sevent and their plans for the future. (The sound is iffy, but that's because unlike John Green, I'm pretty new to all12/16/2015BookCon and Book Expo of America In New York -- One City, Two Events and LOTS of Books | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=0cf28284-a1ac-4de1-9b54-5b3de3f78cd6&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/2this video-ing stuff.)For me, the BEA was pretty sleepy this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In years past, people would trundle around luggage on wheels sothey could pile up on galleys, the advance copies of big releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now with so many books available as e-galleys online, that intense drive to "get" a certain book right away so you could read it and judge for yourselfjust wasn't there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aisles seemed less crowded -- especially in the vast area where a huge contingent fromChina laid out elaborate displays of books published in China and Chinese books they hoped to promote in theUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was impressive, but with faux grass and small shrubbery in the middle of mini-plazas they'd created, thedisplays looked like quiet public gardens for private contemplation whenever you stumbled into that area of theshow floor.BookCon was more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fans weren't nearly as overwhelming as the aisle-clogging crowd at Comic-Con in the fall But they were just as passionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starry celebs included Mindy Kaling, BJ Novak, Jason Segal,Judy Blume and R.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stine of Goosebumps fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But just as many fans were excited to see vloggers turnedauthors like Connor Franta or attending panels like the Rotten Tomatoes event where the audience squared offwith critics like Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News and voted on the best and worst movies based onbooks. (I know Neumaier and happily booed when he said The Golden Compass was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And kudos to theyoung woman who amusingly and correctly said the worst book into film was The Cat In The Hat.)The event still needs a lot of TLC to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish the floors were filled with indie sellers just like Comic-Con.Specialized booksellers and self-published authors and vendors of pulp fiction collectables and contests andgive-aways (a lot more give-aways) would help give fans a lot more to do than roam the aisles of boothspublishers mounted for BEA and then mostly abandoned once BookCon began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BookCon is such a no-brainer --people spend some $16 billion a year on books (not counting textbooks and the like or that number would bemuch bigger).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every season brings great books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And every season deserves an event with a lot of hoopla to letpeople know those books are coming out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next year BookCon takes place in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully some day soonit'll come to a city near you.Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head toBookFilter if you want to find more great picks in every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover smart picks by our crackerjackstaff, not crowd-sourced reviews saying -- yet again -- hey, you should read "The Girl On A Train!"
