(I'm paraphrasing.) And he told me that onepassage he always turns to for inspiration is in Philippians. (In my King James Version, it'sPhilippians 4:13, "I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me." I politely challenged him and said I believed that God doesn't care who wins the World Series, for example, so we shouldn't thank Him for that since He knows earthly glory isn't important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do youthank God when you fail? Horton came up with a funny anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he had a terrible spill,slapping his face into the horizontal bar and collapsing to the ground with blood streaming downhis face, Horton says he immediately thanked God that he was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today Horton had arough meet, falling off the pommel horse and his favorite, the horizontal bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So hopefully he'll findcomfort in his faith and in knowing that the event he did the weakest on -- the horizontal bar -- isalso his best event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doing poorly on it is more frustrating but it also means it should be easier forhim to improve on that in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the athletes will meet again in competition before finally gutting it out for the Olympic team in Philly this June and then moving on to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See them up close while you can: in Beijing they'llbe fighting for gold medals and you'll need gold just to afford the tickets to see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Email Print More in Entertainment...
