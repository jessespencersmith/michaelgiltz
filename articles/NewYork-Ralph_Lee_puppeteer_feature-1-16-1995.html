                <p>Illy} Scary onsters Ralph Lee is perhaps best known by New Yorkers for being the guiding spirit of the legendarilY eccentric Halloween parade in Greenwich Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as a puppeteer-designer, he spends most of his time trying to be in tune with the legends, folklore, and myths of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His latest work, Hearl of the farlh: A Popol Vuh Story (at Intar from January 11 to 29) is based on a Mayan creation myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story of two youths who trav­ el to the underworld and playa deadly game of soccer with the Lords ot Death, it was first tackled by Lee in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest incarnation was one ot the hits of the 1994 International Puppetry Festival at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, owing to both the fantastical, wittY crea­ tures (which he based on Mayan imagery) and his charming take on the old tale. "There's a lot of pottery put into Mayan graves," explains Lee, "and a lot of them depict scenes from the Popol Vuh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lords of Death are often depicted as decrepit, skeletal figures belching great farts, or they'll have some dis­ gusting gases emanating from their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That gave me a reallY good clue as to what kind of attitude to take: They're humorous and horrific at the same time." Growing up in Middlebury, Vermont, Lee used a hand­ puppet theater to tell folk stories at birthday par­ ties and for school groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An early high point was a performance for his father's friend Robert Frost. "H wasn't very long, so he was able to endure it," Lee says with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, he's dramatized myths and legends from Native American, Eskimo, and countless other cul­ tures. "I try to be true to the original story, but at the same time acknowledge that I'm Winnebago Indian, for instance." MICHAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GILTZ</p>
