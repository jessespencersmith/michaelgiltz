It seems like a bizarre, one-off phenomenon, a feverdream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Beck shows precisely how it happened then, how it has happened before and how it will happen again.He brilliantly marshals information on changes in psychiatry, changes in law enforcement, changes in politics andchanges in society that led to conditions in which these panics occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while he offers a prescription at thevery end, Beck's analysis leads you to understand it's almost inevitable some new panic unhinged from facts willstrike again. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Intellectually nimble… [Beck’s] argument should prove far more enduring than all the lies and self-deceptions, socredulously believed in the 1980s, that this book does a devil of a job correcting.” —New York Times“[Thirty] years ago America was described as experiencing an ‘epidemic’ of sexual abuse in day care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Beck,an editor at N+1, does a herculean job of investigating why this happened in his absorbing book We Believe TheChildren.” —Washington Post“In this sharp, sensitive debut [Beck] deftly examines all the forces that came together in this strange moment in ourhistory.” —Boston Globe“Beck argues, convincingly, that the sexual revolution of the ’60s and ’70s provoked a conservative backlash in the’80s, fueling parental paranoia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The social and political conditions at the time set the stage for the most destructivemoral panic since the Salem witch trials.” —The Daily Beast“N+1 editor Beck surveys the wild allegations, surreal trials, and sensational atmosphere of a child abuse panic thatgripped the United States during the 1980s, while lucidly analyzing…</p>
