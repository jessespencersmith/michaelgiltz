Unless you're also afraid of the AM/FMradio signals that bombard you every day, afraid of grocery store item scanners, afraid of thesignals that zap you every time you walk in and out of a store so they can check for security devices,there is no sound scientific medical reason to be afraid of your cell phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to be on thesafe side, you should also wear aluminum foil on your head, "just in case." Gupta also came out on the losing end in my opinion when trying to attack Michael Moore's documentary Sicko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His initial report on the film and subsequent debate with Moore led to CNN having to issue corrections fixing Gupta's errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They never spotlighted a single factual error byMoore but simply took issue with how Moore cherrypicked the data he cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is CNN's Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam The President's Daugthers Check Out The Lastest Pics Of Malia &amp; Sasha Obama At The Frisky! www.TheFrisky.com Target: US President Obama Assassination Plot Foiled Watch this story. www.russiatoday.com Michelle Obama in J.CrewÃ‚Â® First Lady of Style: Get Looks Like Those Worn by Michelle Obama. www.JCrew.com Right Now on HuffPost REPORT: NORTH KOREA LAUNCHESROCKET SEOUL, South Korea â€”North Korea defiantly carried out...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sunday Roundup In Strasbourg yesterday,the president was...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(Basically, he offered up a note from his doctor insisting that Obama was fine.) Let's hope that's not a pattern, just like the selection of Gupta seems a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush wallowed in cronyism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hoped Obama would embrace competence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's hardly been the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why was Bill Richardson picked for Secretary of Commerce? Given the state of our economy, I would expect Obama to pick someone who lived and breathed commerce and was bursting withsmart, progressive ideas about how to stimulate the economy and get us back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, bytheir own admission, Richardson's biggest asset seems to have been his high profile and hisHispanic roots. (Aren't two Hispanics in the Cabinet enough of a show of respect?) Certainly,commerce has not been the laser-like focus of Richardson over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why was Leon Panetta picked as head of the CIA? (And what possible reason could there be for keeping Diane Feinstein out of the loop on it?) Panetta has zero intelligence experience and even his own supporters agree he'll need to have a staff of advisers who are well-grounded in theintelligence community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gee, you think? I'd like to imagine that ALL the top people at the CIA hada strong background in intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panetta's main qualification seems to have been that he's well-known, a celebrity in political circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather breathtakingly, Obama's people insist that one ofPanetta's qualifications is that he received intelligence briefings from the CIA when he was theWhite House Chief of Staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, because he received briefings from the CIA, he's nowqualified to run the CIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I often read Supreme Court rulings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess that means I'm ready to bethe Chief Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how about the hate-mongerer Rick Warren? Did Obama choose to honor a person of faith at his inauguration that reflected his own personal values, someone that celebrated the diversity ofthis country and showed a respect for people of other faiths and even people of no faith? No, hechose Warren, a man who actively attacks the beliefs of most Americans, spreads hate about gays by comparing them to pedophiles and incest, lies about it, also lied about Prop 8 by insisting he would be thrown in jail if it didn't pass and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why did Obama choose him? Because Warren is a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lots of people know him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even if Warren's beliefs are antithetical to those of most Americans and certainly most of Obama's actual supporters, fame outstrips everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Sanjay Gupta will prove an effective Surgeon General, if he accepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's certainly an effective communicator, a smart man, and an Emmy-winning, best-selling author and celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But first he'll need to clean up his questionable ethics, junk the junk science and embrace thescientific and medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What do you think of Gupta as Surgeon General? Any other Obama picks you're disappointed in?UPDATE: The New York Times blogs about the debate over Gupta, with links to articles and comments that mention Gupta has also waffled on issues like vaccines and autism, opposes medical marijuana, is considered by many on the left to be in the pocket of big pharma, opposesuniversal health care, played up the risks of Avian flu in the US to scare up ratings, and other caseswhere he might be cowtowing to irrational fears or entrenched interests rather than siding with thescientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Related News On Huffington Post: Sanjay Gupta, Surgeon General?

My guess is that Gupta, along with Warren, are Obama's way of trying to reach out to middle America, the masses, or whatever he calls us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Message to Obama: we are way smarter than you think we are. wiseraven See Profile I'm a Fan of wiseraven permalink Perhaps Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Feinstein was kept out of the loop re: Panetta because of the bungled job that she andher committee have done during the past administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since she heads the committee that didn'tverify the WMDs or any number of other bits of intelligence, why should she be consulted about thenew CIA chief? Maybe Pres.-elect Obama has sent a signal to her, Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rockefeller, and the others who let this nation down by their shoddy oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subversive See Profile I'm a Fan of Subversive permalink Was Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil not available? jathemelis See Profile I'm a Fan of jathemelis permalink But is Surgeon General really THAT serious of a position? It's not even a part of the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I were going to pick a famous Doc I'd pick Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew Weil, who I find to be fair, grounded in science and yetwilling to look into safe alternative treatments that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Big Pharma the way it is, I'd like to seesomeone who is steeped in preventative medicine.Or that Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oz from those "You...!" books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; M1 See Profile I'm a Fan of M1 permalink Obama won the election in large part because the economy crashed and moderate Republicans couldnot bring themselves to vote for a Palin ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the economy rights itelf or does not right itself,either way, he will no longer have such a large win margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next Republican who is more moderatewill have a good chance at taking the white house in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is why Obama is running hard and fastto right of center and is selecting celebrity figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He intends to use the media to brainwash Americansinto believing whatever he sells is the change we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence his attraction to Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gupa and Warren and Tim Kaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 2012, Obama will have a record to view and not just beautiful speech smattered with a light record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2012, Obama will likely hit the Republican and evangelical wall he is so trying to break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theloss of progressive support could very well end his Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My guess is that Obama's picks aremore about Obama winning in 2012 then anyone would like to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gidster See Profile I'm a Fan of Gidster permalink Do you even believe that?Rush Limbaugh 1 Minute Poll Rush Limbaugh New GOP Mascot?

Uh, that seems a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think Gupta has any strong evangelical or right wing base. godhelpusall See Profile I'm a Fan of godhelpusall permalink kudos to you, michael, for your thoughtful and in-depth participation in the conversation +++ Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half the fun of blogging is talking with the people who comment on your posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefullypeople will appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie4Obama See Profile I'm a Fan of Natalie4Obama permalink Sicko is the greatest movie made - I grew up in the UK and the health care was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's notsocialism, anyone with money or a good job buys into BUPA private health care which is forced to beamazing as they are competing with a free service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that Obama picked a critic of the movie disappoints me as the change this country needs really isn't someone else who will be in the pocket of the pharma industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Joel Fuhrman's Eat To Live book literally changed my life and ridded me of headaches, anxiety, extra weight and hypoglycemia - with obesity in this country reaching a 60% level it would have been nice for him to pick out someone who would focus on preventative medicine such as healthy lifestylechanges rather than spending billions on avoidable problems such as heart disease or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama has been disappointing me lately with this choice, and Warren so let's see how he does in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I understand he is trying to bring in people who represent the country as a whole but this is ourtime, the Democratic administration and there should be no tolerance for ignorance. leopoldmozart See Profile I'm a Fan of leopoldmozart permalink I totally agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would have been wonderful if he had chosen someone like Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dean Ornishor Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel Fuhrman; a physician who also greatly appreciates the role of diet and lifestyle inour health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I'll check out that book, though I think I'll still have to give Citizen Kane andCasablanca and the Apu Trilogy the edge over Sicko :) mypov123 See Profile I'm a Fan of mypov123 permalink Is this another example of Obama's "team of rivals", being that Gupta doesn't support universal healthcare??

The trampling of the constitution, democracy and human decency by the Bush Administration knows no equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I agree wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama just has to do a so-so job in order to look brilliant comparedto Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if he actually obeys the law? Bonus! Neither Gupta nor Warren are veryimportant in the scheme of things, with Warren being an especially transitory (if annoying)choice. jmpurser See Profile I'm a Fan of jmpurser permalink Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LetMeUnderstandThis See Profile I'm a Fan of LetMeUnderstandThis permalink So all those who have a problem with Gupta, who would you have selected?

(In case you'reinterested, there is absolutely positively certainly no evidence that autism is caused by vaccines.Something is causing the rise of autism, parkinson's, and alzheimer's, and it is crucial for the health ofour children and elderly that we find what it is, but it is ABSOLUTELY NOT VACCINES.)
