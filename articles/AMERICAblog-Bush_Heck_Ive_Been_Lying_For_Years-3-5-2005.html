                <p>S A T U R D A Y , M A R C H 0 5 , 2 0 0 5Bush: Heck, I've Been Lying For Yearsby Michael in New York on 3/05/2005 01:32:00 PMThanks to A Hidden Saint for reminding us that Bush had plansto privatize Social Security before the election, but when itproved politcally damaging he called everyone within sight liarsand insisted it wasn't true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is from a Salon article aboutthe fallout from a NYT Magazine feature.Per Slate 10/19/04: "The latest volley came over the weekend when Republicancampaign officials accused the Times Sunday magazine of fabricating aprovocative quote from Bush in which he bragged -- behind closed doors andspeaking to wealthy supporters -- that he would announce plans for "privatizingof Social Security" early next year, after his reelection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Democratsjumped on the remark, dubbing it the "January surprise," Republican NationalCommittee chairman Ed Gillespie dismissed the Times' work as "Kitty Kelleyjournalism," insisting Bush never uttered the phrase attributed to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But theTimes stands by the 8,300-word story by Ron Suskind, author of "The Price ofLoyalty: George W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush, the White House and the Education of Paul O'Neill,"a revealing account of the former secretary of the treasury published earlier thisyear."Questions for Bush:1.Why did you lie right before the election? It's especially obvious you're lyingbecause of the numerous features you've cooperated in the last few weeks inwhich your fascination with dismantling -- excuse me, reforming -- SocialSecurity has been a pet project of yours since you were Governor of Texas.2.Why did you deny it in October 2004?3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why weren't you straight with the American people?4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will you apologize to the New York Times and Ron Suskind?5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Social Security is in crisis, why do you refuse to offer a detailed plan ofyour own?Questions for the New York Times:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is wrong with you? We may have forgotten about this fracas, but surelyYOU didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second Bush proposed dismantling Social Security, the NYTshould have been all over him, repeating the story it had run in October andBush's heated denials and the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why wouldn't they trumpet their ownreporting? And if they had, Bush would have been on the defensive from thevery start.Finally, can we all agree to refuse any attempt to call what Bush is doing asreforming or fixing Social Security? What Bush is proposing isDISMANTLING Social Security, pure and simple, replacing a safety net with a"good luck" and a pat on the back for the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE POSTS ABOUT: RON PAUL Paul KrugmanProfessor in chief - I found Obama's health carepresentation so impressive - so much command ofthe issues - that it had me worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I really like apoliticians' speech, is...9 minutes ago EschatonObama Speaks - In Case You Missed It18 minutes ago Daily KosWaterloo, But for Who?
