(However, that particular book isn't available onKindle or Sony's E-Reader .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sequel, however, is.) So I'm both intrigued and wary of electronic books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I won't be happy until every new book I buy comes with a free eBook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I can see the appeal and wanted to find out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IS IT LIKE READING A BOOK? -- Yep, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found the Kindle 2.0 very easy to read, with no discernible difference in eye strain or the like whether reading a Kindle or a print edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I found the leather cover essential for reading. (And $30 for something that reallyshould come for free with the $360.00 Kindle 2.0 is annoying.) Even when I "folded" the coverback (something I would never do on a print edition), I needed that cover to hold and feelcomfortable while reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The heft of the Kindle was nice, solid but not too heavy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not a Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Stephen Colbert Rips Apart Glenn Beck: Building His Career On 9/11 (VIDEO) Stephen Colbert rippedapart Fox News host (andNew York...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin Disinvited,Newt Gingrich In For Major GOP Dinner WASHINGTON -- Alaska Gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin is out, and former House Speaker Newt...

Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading a book on the iPhone is highly impractical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I use it to read the occasional Shakespearean sonnet or some other poetry, but that's as far as it can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IS THE KINDLE 2.0 A BIG JUMP ON THE 1.0? -- Oh yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strangely, a lot of the reviews described the 2.0 as just tweaking the design of the 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I disagree strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Kindle 1.0, to me, was always very junky and cheap feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The buttons for advancing pages were poorly designed,with the biggest complaint being that anyone just trying to hold the device invariably flipped thepages by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That problem is completely removed with the 2.0 which is much sleeker andnicer than the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The page buttons are press-able on the inside only, almost to a fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sactually a tad difficult to change pages, which is definitely an improvement on too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps asmall raised button on the inside would make it more tactile and user-friendly? The keyboardlooks much nicer and the look overall is much, much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This feels like a real device, not a toy.I'd be happy to keep it around and show it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, I can't keep a comment by David Pogue ofthe New York Times out of my head: he said it looked like it was designed by the people who didthe Commodore 64 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not quite fair for the new Kindle but really: would it kill them to make it available in black and other colors? White is about the least friendly color for a device you'regoing to be handling all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IS WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY A BIG DEAL? -- Before I used it, the Whispernet function of the Kindle 2.0 seemed a little silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the big deal about plugging in a Kindle to your computer when you want a new book? I do it with my iPod, right? But I had to admit, this feature wassurprisingly nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's something almost sinfully easy about lying in bed late at night with yourKindle, thinking about a book you want to read and a few seconds later you've found it, purchasedit, and begun reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The free first chapter offer (available for seemingly any book at the Kindlestore) is also tempting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To me, it's still not a big negative in other devices to have to hook up to acomputer to purchase and download a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the breeze of constant connectivity is a biggerpositive than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW ABOUT GETTING YOUR OWN DOCUMENTS ONTO THE KINDLE? -- Sight unseen, I was very adamantly opposed to the way the Kindle works this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have a Word or PDF document you want to carry around on your Kindle, you have to email it to the Kindle people whothen download it onto your personal device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Privacy be damned, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This annoyed the heckout of me in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In practice? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It worked easily and almost as quickly as buying anew book on the Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several articles and blogs I'd written came to the Kindle in Word formatsand were easily read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CAN YOU BUY ALL THE BESTSELLERS? -- Yes, you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is true of Kindle 2.0 and the Sony E-Reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, I went through the Top 15 New York Times bestsellers in fiction and nonfiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both devices had every title available, with one exception: the Sony E-Reader did nothave the nonfiction title Inside The Revolution available, while Kindle did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And neither device had the new John Grisham, who must be a technophobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What you can't do with the Kindle (or theSony E-Reader) is just name books you want to read and find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current releases are availableand the obvious classic titles ( The Three Musketeers, Wuthering Heights and the like).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many, many catalog titles are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindle may have 250,000 titles available but publishers put out thatmany books every two years, so there are a LOT of gaps to fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I looked for the massive two volumeWinston Churchill biography The Last Lion but it wasn't available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Churchill's own acclaimed history of World War II is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I looked for Dreadnought , that doorstop of a book and it's not available (and neither is most anything else by this best-selling historian EXCEPT the sequel toDreadnought , which is available.) HOW EXPENSIVE ARE THE EBOOKS? -- Kindle has got most everything at $10 or less, with exceptions of course. (They're all detailed at Amazon, as well as the Kindle online store, whichdoes NOT include the readers comments from Amazon.) Sony E-Reader's store has titles morecommonly at $11, which is $2 more than Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a lot of variability in pricing, though, withKindle generally cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can buy Joe Torre and Tom Verducci's The Yankee Years for $17.61 on sale in hardcover at Amazon or you can get it at the Sony eBook store for $18.87 (bizarrely, it'sMORE expensive than the hardcover) or you can get it on Kindle for $10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prices are set by people like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Touching the Queenwasn't the only...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; April Fools 2009!

The Sony e-version is $14 and the Kindle is $10 butI'd much prefer to buy the paperback (or hardcover) and get a download for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why not? Onceyou've set up the edition as a digital download, making it available is super cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forcing peopleto choose which version they want (which is like making people choose whether they want to beable to play the CD they purchase ONLY in their car or ONLY at home or ONLY on theircomputer) is just crazy and will push them into embracing pirate versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHAT ABOUT THAT COMPUTERIZED READING VOICE OPTION? -- Publishers are idiots to demand Kindle give them the option of turning off this feature on select titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A computerized voice reads the text for you in a mechanical, but not bad manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a genuine audiobook, in which someone really performs the text or at least lets you hear the author speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just a computerized transcription, just like people already have available on their computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought it would be dumb, but there are moments maybe when shaving or cooking breakfast you might want to keep hearing something you're looking at, especially if it's an owner's manual or some text from work, as opposed to Great Expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And editions for the blind take FOREVER to come out and aren't available for many titles, so removing this option is obnoxious for those who might make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking of impaired vision, the ability to increase the size of the text is terrific for older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHAT ABOUT CLASSIC TITLES? ARE THEY FREE OR CHEAP? -- I was a little surprised to find free editions of some classic titles (Sherlock Holmes, etc.) on the Kindle store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course Google has raised the bar with its deal with Sony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't work out the same details and make the same titles available to Kindle down the road, though no one is talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there are also many publishers making public domain titles available in extremely cheap sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bought the complete Charles Dickens for $5; Mark Twain for $4, Balzac for $5, a handful of Trollope for $4 and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With $30 to play with, I filled my Kindle with literally hundreds of classic and new titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shakespeare is a different beast: I've yet to find a free or cheap edition that presented the plays nicely. (Getting the line-breaks right ain't easy, apparently.) You can also find lots of websites with free downloads of public domain titles in Kindle or E-Reader friendly versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm a clumsy tech guy and tried a couple of them and couldn't find any that came up properly on the Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm certain this will get easier and -- again --Google (with their call for free content on any platform and any device) will surely make their500,000 and counting public domain titles available in Kindle friendly versions as well that willwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IS IT THE IPOD OF ELECTRONIC BOOKS? -- No, for one simple reason: you can't put all your books on it for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The iPod was backward compatible; any CDs you owned could be rippedand placed on it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh if only that were true of the Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only you could, say, scanyour UPC code and show you own a title and get an electronic version of every book you own onthe Kindle for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd buy one immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when you buy a new book, in mostcases you have to decide in advance whether you want a hardcover or wait one year for a paperbackor a more expensive audio version or a cheaper ebook version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This must change, in my mind, forthese electronic books to become widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHO SHOULD BUY THE KINDLE? -- If you travel a lot and like the classics or have lots of disposable income and don't mind buying the cheap ebook versions of new titles you may already own or want in a print edition, the Kindle is very tempting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It reads terrifically well, it's lightweightand portable and easy to use and you can fill it up with classics very, very cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're like meand worry about running out of reading material, the Kindle is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can bring two books andthe Kindle and be set for the weekend or a month, frankly, without any anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're old andhave poor eyesight, the ability to have de facto large print editions of classics and new bestsellers isgreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, if you have eclectic tastes and expect to find any title you're looking for availableon the Kindle, you'll get frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Browsing the Kindle store to find titles to read is fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butlooking for a particular book that came out 10 or 20 years ago is frustrating since half the time it'snot available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found it telling when I was looking for some acclaimed authors who have wonawards and hit the bestseller lists but are still "midlist" as opposed to perennial bestsellers likeJohn Updike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Padgett Powell? None.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Taylor? None.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Helprin? One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edmund White?Four, but mostly minor works and none of his acknowledged classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Millhauser? His threemost recent only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the way, John Updike is no better, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found only eight books, amishmash of mostly recent releases and none of the Rabbit books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This situationwill improve with time (and with the number of people who actually buy these electronic books).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Madonna Video Celebrity Skin David Letterman Newspapers Health Rod Blagojevich Real Estate G-20 Summit MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

Have you played with one?

I heart my Kindle! Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I found the web access area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's so clumsy and stripped down, I feel like it barely counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many titles do you have on your Kindle? And do you just buy ebooks or have youbought something in print and a Kindle version because you want a copy to keep but like theease of the e-version? Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thx for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How do you access the internet? I'm looking at the menu and home pagesand don't see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why would anyone pay for a subscription to the New York Times if they could go online and read it for free? onceler See Profile I'm a Fan of onceler permalink But now that the iPhone has a Kindle app, isn't the Kindle already obsolete? And for the love of Yaweh, can they cut about $150 off the price?Seriously, they have been selling similar devices for children's learning purposes for years that have a little less capacity but are under $80 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For $360, just keep saving, get a laptop, and 'read' off of that. jl4141 See Profile I'm a Fan of jl4141 permalink Did you even read the article before posting this? Glitz addressed the shortcomings of the iPhone and the high price, among other concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And reading off a laptop? Yeah, that'll fitnicely into your jacket pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BTW, it's "Yahwey," not "Yawey."
