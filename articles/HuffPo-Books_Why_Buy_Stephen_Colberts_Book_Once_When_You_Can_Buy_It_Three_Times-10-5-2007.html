In other words, he expects fans ofColbert to buy the hardcover book for $27, then buy the audio book for about $16 and while you'reat it, when a downloadable version becomes available for your Sony Reader or computer orBlackberry, maybe you'd be willing to pay another $25 or so for that version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evenwhen the audio book isn't somewhat different from the hardcover, they expect fans of a book tobuy it twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine if the music industry demanded you buy onecopy of your album for playing on your home stereo,another for your car, another for your iPod and so on.You wouldn't do it, would you? But the book industry- which publishes more than 100,000 titles a year -thinks it's perfectly reasonable to expect you to do it for books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Except you're not even buying books in hardcover: specialty and independent bookstoresare disappearing and sales are flat or down in most categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every industry wants to mimic the success of the DVD, one of the most successful products in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Books add in reader's guides and author interviews and think that is akin to the DVDextras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some even include public domain DVDs with movie versions of classic novels like JaneEyre and A Tale Of Two Cities and the like, as if people who read books really would rather be watching movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the lessons of the DVD are simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It offered far superior picture and sound to VHS, contained Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

So here's what the book industry needs to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bring back the mass market paperback for all titles and keep the price low, say $7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Package them as attractively as you do the trade paperbacks andhardcover editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here's the tricky part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audio books are a valid niche market, that brings in money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downloadable books could be a revenue stream in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You need to make the bookmore attractive and that means offering more extras for the same (or lower) price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone whobuys a hardcover book should get free access to the audio version and the downloadable text.Imagine buying a book and being able to get the audio edition for listening in your car or iPod andan easily portable downloadable version for your Blackberry or laptop or electronic reader.Happily, with the Internet, making these available will cost very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once you've made a copy,it's easy to share with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, people might see the $25 or more they pay for a hardcover book as a decent value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a lot more ways to catch up on the book they bought, people would be encouraged to read morebooks and more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finding cheap, attractive paperbacks always available would continue thattrend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Colbert's fans will be laughing at his jokes on the subway, in the car, on a plane, atwork on their lunch hour and at home - and without having to spend $65 for the pleasure ofbuying the same book again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So have you ever bought a book in two different formats (ie hardcover and audio)? Would you be more likely to buy a book if it came with the extras of audio and downloadable text? Would you rather buy a trade paperback for $16 instead of a mass market paperback for $7? And have youever been surprised by the price of a book and decided not to buy it?

And a well-read book is a fine entertainment in and of itself --such as Jim Dale's marvelous work on Harry Potter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How else can a family sit together and enjoy a book all at the same time? None of this would displace reading itself and I'm certain it would lead to more reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IN any case, whatever your preference -- be it an eBook or an audio file or a hard copy -- booksellers should recharge their industry by making all of them available for one low price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BJNemeth See Profile I'm a Fan of BJNemeth permalink With the media spotlight on Hollywood and the music industry, I hadn't even thought about taking acloser look at the publishing industry's distribution efforts in the online age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the RIAA and Hollywood, I expect major publishers are more fearful of online distribution than anything else, but they have an ace in the hole -- reading a physical book is an experience that can'teasily be duplicated online (yet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, I think if they were to follow your advice, and offer"packages" of hardcover, PDF, and audio versions, it might help spur additional sales. (Provided theydon't get stupid greedy -- since the PDF and audiobook don't add physical costs, keep the hardcover price the same.)

Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Libraries are great and a wonderful resource for anyone who doesn't feel the need to build their own personal library or is short on cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a consumer crazed society, I think gettingpeople to be avid readers (whether via the library or bookstores) is a lot better use of theirmoney and time than $200 sneakers, designer clothes, the latest digital camera or doohickey,the fifth sequel to a bad movie or just about anything else you can name. bn See Profile I'm a Fan of bn permalink If I buy Stephen Colbert's new book it will be the audio version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he records it himself it will be in'character' and that adds depth to the reading, much like Tyler Perry's 'Madea'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other books I eitherbuy hard copies or PDF's...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink You've got a good point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colbert did record it himself, along with Amy Sedaris, Jon Stewartand other contributors, so I'm sure it will have more appeal than most audio books to thecasual reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why should you have to choose? Or more importantly, why should thebook industry force you to choose? Wouldn't you rather get a hardcover copy AND access tothe audio version AND access to a PDF? Wouldn't that make the $20 or so you're going topay seem like a much better deal? It worked with DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newfycrat See Profile I'm a Fan of Newfycrat permalink As someone who has perhaps bought more audio books than most because myMIL has macular degeneration, how good the audio book is (after, of course, howwell the book is written) has everything to do with how good the reader is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Welistened to one book whose author read it so badly, we never talk about the book,only how horrible she read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, some books I bought for my MIL Steven Colberts Book The Colber Report Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:03 PM on 10/06/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:59 PM on 10/08/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:22 AM on 10/06/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:06 PM on 10/06/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:36 PM on 10/05/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:01 PM on 10/06/2007Michael Giltz: Why Buy Stephen Colbert's Book Once When You Can Buy It Three Times? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/why-buy-stephen-colberts_b_67329.html[4/5/2009 8:30:25 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry(who now thankfully can borrow them by mail for free) I bought because I knew the book was good and the reader/actor made them even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those books were a joy to listen to and had I first bought the CD, I never would have bought the book.Although audio books are normally way overpriced, I do understand the necessary value added by getting a good actor to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bad reader can completely ruin the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would pay more for a package of book and audio combined - but not significantly more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it were not for my MIL, I would not have gotten many of the books I did in audio, the surprise was how much better some of these books were inthe audio version than when I read them myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The industry should really try morefor this audience if book sales are in that much decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All CriminallySane See Profile I'm a Fan of CriminallySane permalink "Imagine if the music industry demanded you buy one copy of your album for playing on your homestereo, another for your car, another for your iPod and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You wouldn't do it, would you?" They don't? Remember, the RIAA tried to ban audio cassettes, some labels tried to install "anti-piracy" rootkits that would ostensibly prevent copying CDs, and in actuality rendered people's computers opento intrusion, and are actively suing and harassing people who may or may not have downloaded orshared MP3 tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Yep I was one of the people with the terrific Neil Diamond album I couldn't legally rip and playon my iPod because of their software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And like the movie industry -- which was frightened ofthe VCR and the DVD and downloads -- the music industry and every other industry tends tobe frightened of new technology until they are forced to realize it's good for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But fornow, most CDs can in fact be played on any system at home or in your car or boat or laptopand ripped and put onto a media device like an iPod or take individual tracks and make a mix tape and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as for people who steal music they haven't bought via illegal sharing online, the record companies can and should knuckle down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the best way is not lawsuits but easy, dependable, inexpensive online services like iTunes that give people what they want. blueraven See Profile I'm a Fan of blueraven permalink This is one arena where Baen Books is doing itself and readers a favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, they're releasingelectronic versions of their library for free both online and in CD form inserted in different books theyprint instead of audio books, but they're still providing customers a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And darned if people aren'tmore willing to buy the hard copy once they've read the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know I've been happier buying theirmaterial new based on that little perk alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink That's the sort of innovation a tiny company like Baen must do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, a major houseisn't smart enough to catch on that audio and downloadable versions should be bonuses forbuying a book instead of a revenue stream that forces fans of an author to either have tochoose (do I want a physical copy of the new John Grisham or an audio version to listen toon my trip) or in rare circumstances pay for both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:21 PM on 10/06/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:06 PM on 10/05/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:02 PM on 10/05/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:40 PM on 10/05/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:04 PM on 10/05/2007Michael Giltz: Why Buy Stephen Colbert's Book Once When You Can Buy It Three Times? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/why-buy-stephen-colberts_b_67329.html[4/5/2009 8:30:25 PM]</p>
