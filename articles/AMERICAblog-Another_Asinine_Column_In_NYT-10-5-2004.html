                <p>T U E S D A Y , O C T O B E R 0 5 , 2 0 0 4Another Asinine Column In NYTby Michael in New York on 10/05/2004 02:49:00 AMIf John can shred the Washington Post for not doing its job, I canlaugh at the NYT running column after conservative column.Yesterday it was William Safire claiming John Kerry is a closet right-winger.Today, it's David Brooks doing a lame job of defending the WhiteHouse."Administration officials smile when they talk about [Ayad]Allawi," writes Brooks, "then marvel at how aggressive heis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allawi believes that his government has to establish itsauthority if it, or any future government, is to do its job."Wow, that is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allawi, a leader of the Shiite majority(roughly 60% of the population) that suffered under the Sunni-dominated Hussein reign wants to aggressively crush the Sunnis(roughly 40% of the population cause no one counts the Kurds) andtheir rebellion? What a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what determination."It was clear from our conversation [Brooks and Rumsfeld](and from the way other administration officials talk aboutdecision-making in Iraq) that the charge that Allawi is apuppet is just absurd."Oh, well, if Donald Rumsfeld -- who just yesterday said there was no"strong, hard evidence" linking Saddam and Al Quaeda and then laterreleased a statement saying he has acknowledged since Sept of 2002that there were ties between Al Quaeda and Iraq -- why if he saysAllawi is not a puppet then it must be true.Mind you, a Sunni cleric with power who is not involved in thegovernment saying it might be more convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or say a Kurd leaderwho also has been sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if Rumsfeld says it it would beabsurd for anyone to question it."Yesterday, Rumsfeld said Iraq had "a crack" at being asuccess," writes Brooks. "At least he's not overhyping."Gosh, that is comforting and quite modest given violence and deathshave increased repeatedly since Bush announced "MissionAccomplished" and car bombs went off in three locations."Threepowerful car bombs exploded across Iraq on Monday morning," saysthe NYT today, "killing at least 26 people and wounding more than100 others in a day of carnage that demonstrated the relative easewith which insurgents are striking in the hearts of major cities."So,really, you have to admire Rumsfeld's candor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least he didn't say"Mission Accomplished."
