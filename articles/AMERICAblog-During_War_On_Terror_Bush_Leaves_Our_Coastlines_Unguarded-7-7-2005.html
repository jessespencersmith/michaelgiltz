                <p>T H U R S D A Y , J U L Y 0 7 , 2 0 0 5During War On Terror, Bush Leaves OurCoastlines Unguardedby Michael in New York on 7/07/2005 11:24:00 AMThink Bush will get a bounce from another terrorist attack?Keep in mind this very terrific, page one story in USA Todayabout our crumbling Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's been underfundedfor decades (most of their ships are almost 40 years old!), butBush has been our President since 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's had three yearsto attack this problem.The Coast Guard's ships, planes and helicopters arebreaking down at record rates, which may threaten theservice's ability to carry out its post-9/11 mission ofprotecting ports and waterways against terrorism.Stunning details include radar systems that break down daily, to thepoint where some ships have no idea who is even a mile away whenpatrolling our coasts. (They buy store-bought radars with their ownmoney just so they won't be completely blind.)And what is Bush's reaction to this?The Bush administration wants to increase theamount of time it will take to replace a fleetthat's among the oldest on the globe — oldereven than fleets owned by nations such as Algeria andPakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "deepwater" replacement program,conceived in 1998 as a $20 billion, 20-year plan toreplace the fleet, could be increased to 25 years undera White House plan.The strategy would save the government money inthe short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The White House budget officedeclined to comment.That's right, we had a 20 year program to upgrade the Coast Guardformulated three years before 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the US is attacked andBush's instinct is to DELAY upgrading the Coast Guard's vitalequipment needs from 20 years to 25 years! Republican SenatorOlympia Snowe wants to speed this up to 10-15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they'reboth out of their minds. $20 billion to provide essential needs of theCoast Guard and BEGIN to secure our coastlines and ports? We spend$5 billion a month in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bush wants to DELAY this? And why10-15 years? It should be done in 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a WAR and Bush iscallously leaving our coastlines unguarded.What are some of the duties of the Coast Guard?The Coast Guard was moved into the Department ofHomeland Security in 2003 and given primary responsibilityfor maritime security in addition to its regular duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theadded responsibilities include patrolling the nation's 361ports and 95,000 miles of coastline, boarding andinspecting tens of thousands of cargo ships and recreationalboats, and reviewing security at the nation's commercialports.As the 9-11 Commission reported:"While commercial aviation remains a possible target,terrorists may turn their attention to other modes.Opportunities to do harm are as great, or greater, inmaritime or surface transportation."
