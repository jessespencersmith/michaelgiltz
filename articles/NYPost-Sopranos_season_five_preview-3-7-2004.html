They happily predict it could mark heightened tensions and internal vio­ lence for the mob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the parolees are Robert Log­ gia as the violent Feech; Joe Santos (Detective Becker of "The Rockford Files"); and wisecracking Steve Busce­ mi as Tony's cousin and childhood best friend who wants to go straight and become a licensed massage therapist , If all these problems are bugging Tony, they're not half as troublesome as the "bugs" he barely suspects, The feds are all over the place. listening in on conversations, turning weak underlings into informants and building up a case of massive circumstantial evidence that they hope will bring his entire world crashing down; The new season brings back old themes -Christopher (Michael Imperi­ oli) whines about not getting respect, Paulie (Tony Sirico) seems increasingly unhappy and Uncle Junior (Dominic Chi­ anese) increasingly unstable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adriana starts to crack under the intense pressure over her status as a stool pigeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And is that Tony watching scenes from Barbra Streisand's "The Prince of Tides" and quoting Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phil?
