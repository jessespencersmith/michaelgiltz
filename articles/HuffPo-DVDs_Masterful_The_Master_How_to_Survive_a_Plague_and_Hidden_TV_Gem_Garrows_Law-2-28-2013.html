                <p>DVDs: Masterful The Master , How to Survive a Plague and Hidden TV Gem Garrow's Law A clutch of new releases, including more Oscar nominees (that should have won but didn't), along with some enigmatic road movies and a little-seen TV series that mystery buffs will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MASTER ($39.99 BluRay combo; Weinstein/Anchor Bay) HOLY MOTORS ($39.95 BluRay; Vivendi) A SIMPLE LIFE ($29.98 BluRay; Well Go) -- One of thebest films of the year, it's almost a shame to see The Master in your home rather than in gorgeous 70mm in a movie theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butnowadays with BluRay and largescreen TVs, chances are you'll beseeing a very good presentation ofthis hypnotic, brilliant film indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iadmired and enjoyed ittremendously on first viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butonce I knew the landscape, once Ihad seen the film, a secondviewing allowed it all to "click" andI fully appreciated what writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson accomplished here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entire cast is attheir peak, especially Joaquin Phoenix as a loser seemingly ripe for the pickingby a cult/religion/self-help philosophy, Amy Adams as the Master's controllingand focused wife and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the innovator/self-deluderhimself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though clearly inspired by the broad brushstrokes of the early days ofScientology, this is not an expose and it's not a look at how someone can bedrawn into a cult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's about a troubled veteran of World War II, a broken andconfused young man who always had trouble dealing with others and tampingdown his own personal demons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This cult, this religion, this family is his bestshot at a happy life but he may be incapable of taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is the fascinatingstory that emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're looking for a tale of a shyster, you will bedisappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why those who embrace Scientology might not be botheredby the film and it's also why this is a richer, more complex work than yet anothertale of a hypocritical con man a la Elmer Gantry and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the extras is the very unexpected and very welcome appearance of director John Huston's1946 documentary about WW II veterans called Let There Be Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far more opaque is Holy Motors, another movie beloved of critics in 2012 but not seen by a wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I grew frustrated by the film which has a vague driving narrative that they seem to spell out or hint at (it's never fully clear what's going on) but then break their own rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, Denis Lavant has great fun as a mysterious man sent around a city in a limousine to don disguises and act as a catalyst in various scenes and/or real life events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He plays women and men, young and old and it'sa genuine treat to watch him cavort, even if the film is ultimately a rather flimsy excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did especially love the beautiful scenedone in a motion capture studio set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far more direct and accessible is A Simple Life, another critically acclaimed film and under the radar to most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It deserves a bigger audience on DVD and BluRay since this story of a famed movie producer who mustsuddenly care for the nanny that has served his family for decades is universal and appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy Lau and Deanie Ip star asthe mogul and the maid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW TO SURVIVE A PLAGUE($24.98 DVD; SundanceSelects/MPI)OVER YOUR CITIES GRASSWILL GROW ($29.95 DVD; Kino Lorber)BESTIAIRE ($29.99 DVD; Zeitgeist)May 2, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 02/28/2013 3:34 pmAFRICA ($29.98 DVD; BBC Earth) THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY ($24.99 DVD; PBS) -- Five newdocumentaries including one ofthe best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How ToSurvive A Plague is about the AIDS crisis and how a group ofvolunteers educated themselvesand fought back when faced withmassive indifference by thegovernment and the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without minimizing the constant loss, the film is actually apositive one, filled with humor andinsight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also tackles a verycomplex issue -- how AIDS groupslike ACT-Up revolutionizedmedical research and care foreverin this country and around theworld by giving patients a voiceand a place at the table wheredecisions are made -- and tells itwith deceptive ease and clarity.Excellent. ( It's no surprise ABC is turning this into a miniseries.Smart choice.) Sophie Fiennescontinues to grow as adocumentary filmmaker with OverYour Cities Grass Will Grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a strong look at the artist Anselm Kiefer and his creative process in developing large scale works.Gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bestiaire is an odd duck, a film that watches people watching animals, or is that animals watching people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deceptively simple but quiteinteresting and very well shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Africa is a typically gorgeous looking BBC documentary, narrated by the voice of God naturalist David Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Notequal to their peak work but solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, writer-director Chip Duncan takes an"unbiased" which is to say sober but not terribly insightful look at The ReaganPresidency in a three hour work best at illuminating his decisive part in ending the Cold War alongside Mikhail Gorbachev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LONELIEST PLANET($24.98 DVD; Sundance Selects)SILENT SOULS ($29.99 DVD; Zeitgeist) -- Two enigmatic roadmovies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Loneliest Planet stars Gael Garcia Bernal as one half ofan engaged couple that heads out on a hiking trip in Georgia, formerly of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Youmust pay close attention to thisone; a brief moment is the hingeon which the movie turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miss itand you'll be wondering exactlywhat the heck is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itenjoyed great acclaim from the arthouse critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also set in Russia,Silent Souls shows a husband taking his late wife's remains on a pilgrimage, telling the story of their marriage along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beautifully shot, itand other road movies from that country seem to indicate all of Russia is on aquest of some sort, lost and mapless at best.GARROW'S LAW THE COMPLETE COLLECTION($79.99 DVD: Acorn)THE PRIME OF MISS JEANBRODIE ($49.99 DVD; Acorn) MAIGRET: THE COMPLETECOLLECTION ($59.99 DVD;Acorn)ROCKO'S MODERN LIFE THECOMPLETE SERIES ($29.93 DVD; Shout)IRON ROAD ($19.98 DVD; EONe) -- Garrow's Law hasn't made much of an impression in the US.And to make matters worse, it wascancelled in the UK after just threeseasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a superiorcourtroom drama/mystery seriesthat Anglophiles should snap up.Not in the absolute top tier ofFoyle's War, but very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew Buchan stars as thehistorical figure William Garrow,the man who became famous forhis work at the Old Bailey, whereRumpole would later harrumpharound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each episode typicallyinvolves a case that illuminates lifein the 1700s and allows Garrow tolearn from his mentor (AlunArmstrong) and benefit from the support of Lady Sarah (Lyndsey Marshall of Being Human ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie is a seven part miniseries from 1978 starring GeraldineMcEwan in the role made famousby Maggie Smith in the earlier filmof the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author MurielSparks preferred McEwan but ofcourse she had the advantage oftelling the story more fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thegreat Michael Gambon is always ajoy to watch and his intelligenceand sheer presence make Maigretworthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the mysteries andsupporting actors are not up tosnuff and keep this series frombeing more than a pleasantdiversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rocko's Modern Life was among the wave of anarchic cartoons that led by Ren &amp; Stimpy pushed the boundaries for whatmere cartoons could tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisset contains all 52 episodes (thebroadcast versions so a threeminor trims keep some naughty bits sadly unavailable) and is welcome anarchy and silliness about a wallaby who tries to get along after moving from Australiato the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Iron Road is a better than average Canadian miniseries about the building of the railroad. it stars Sam Neill and Peter O'Toole in one of his final turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE TERMINATOR ($19.99 BluRay; MGM)THE INSIDER ($20.00 BluRay; Touchstone) -- The Terminator is a genuine B movie by JamesCameron, a bit of sci-fi nonsensemade on a dime with a lot of witand smarts to compensate for thelow budget. it's always the lavish T2 that gets the deluxiest treatment on laser disc and DVDand BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the originalTerminator finally gets a proper transfer to BluRay and looksterrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Insider is simply director Michael Mann's best film;this look at corruption in thetobacco industry and journalistic ethics can stand alongside All The President's Men and that's high praise indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excellent cast all around. ***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiple combinations, including DVD, Blu-ray, digital download, video on demand, streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
