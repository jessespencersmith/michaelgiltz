                <p>W E D N E S D AY, F E B R U A RY 1 4 , 2 0 0 7A Lear, A Song, A Coast, A Trail And A LyricOkay, catch up time.I saw Kevin Kline's King Lear on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the very firstperformance so I certainly won't review the show other than to say Idon't know if I can see what they're working towards and that worriesme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kline isn't a natural Lear but he was good when Lear was brokenand mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cerveris was of course very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the happy surprise wasJoshua Logan-Green, who has gone from being dumped by "The OC" toperforming Shakespeare at the Public and holding his own.Then I saw Adrift In Macao, a silly film noir musical by ChristopherDurang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For all its faults, it was pretty fun, as the NYTimes put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iwould single out Will Swenson as capturing the dry tone of this satirejust right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In general, these things work better when they're playedstraight, so his big number (in which he talked about paying outsidesongwriters to pen him a tune) didn't work for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And frankly, I can'tbelieve the NYTimes didn't mention that Orville Mendoza (who playsthe "scrutable" Asian Tempura) looks like a dead ringer for Jack Black.Saturday night I saw Part Two of The Coast Of Utopia, which was justterrific and moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no objection, by the way, to ChristopherIsherwood saying he found Coast boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My objection is to his claimthat he was being very bold and brave to swim against the tide of publicopinion in saying so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's nothing safer than taking themost acclaimed movie/tv show/play/book/CD of the year and saying,"Well, it's not THAT good." Saying the Emperor has no clothes is aboutthe easiest thing in the world.Over the weekend, I finally got around to watching the Robert DuvallWestern "Broken Trail," which was very satisfying and perhaps even anotch better than I was hoping for.Finally, I also saw a screening of "Music and Lyrics," in which HughGrant plays Hugh Grant to the point where it almost seems like parody.The parodies of 80s pop tunes -- by Adam Schlesinger of Fountains ofWayne -- were good. "Pop Goes My Heart" does indeed soundconvincingly like a one-hit wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What it doesn't sound like is aNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: A Lear, A Song, A Coast, A Trail And A ...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/02/lear-song-coast-trail-an... 1 of 37/27/09 10:27 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SMichael in New YorkBiboyAaron POPSURFING.COM: A Lear, A Song, A Coast, A Trail And A ...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/02/lear-song-coast-trail-an... 2 of 37/27/09 10:27 PMPOPSURFING.COM: A Lear, A Song, A Coast, A Trail And A ...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/02/lear-song-coast-trail-an... 3 of 37/27/09 10:27 PM</p>
