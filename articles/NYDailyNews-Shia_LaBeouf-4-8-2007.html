"No," says l-aBeouf frrmly, before pointing out he's already working with Spielberg, who's an executive producer on both "Disturbia" and "Trmsfomers " "I wouldn't want to jeopardize my re- lationship with Spielberg, to force my- seu into a situation that I haven't been approached about," he says. "l'm sure he heard about these rumors. lf he thought it was m interesting idea, he'd approach me But he hasn't approached me, and I'm not going to force the hand," Smart kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; StiU, if I:Beouf is waiting for the movie roles to slow down, YaIe is going to be a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He stmed. in the 2003 Disney hit "Holes,"Shia LaBeouf, star of 'Disturbiar' grows up BY MICHAEL GILTZWHERE'S LABEOUF? ThE actor with sarah Roemer (1.) in "Disturbia." Below, in his breakout Irisney TV series, "EYen "Stevens," which debuted in 1999. lemed to play golf for "The Greatest Game Ever Played" in 2005 and last year had a memorable tum as an acid-tripping political volunteer ir "Bobby," as well as the Britty '70s New York-set "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints." But it's not hard to woo laBeouf from school - a good script will snag him. "It took me a long time to frnd 'Saints,"' says la3eouf about his neverending search for good material. "And when I found it, they didn't want me for it! I was the Disneykid So I had to go earn it "l went to the audition room and punched a hole in the casting office wall It was just somewhere I went during the scene and decided to lfollow itl "Then I paid to fix the wall " His passion extends to "Distur' bia, 'which, LaBeouf says, differs from the average kid potboiler, and is more a voyeuristic dra- ma a la "Rear Window." "Usually, teen-thriller f,Ims are very one-note, just screaming and ming all the time It doesn't seem veryhuman Ithinkpeople are sick of that." he says. "But we do have a bunch of different windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are [sev. erall elements to the fiIm." LaBeouf does seem to have an old- school actor's soul inside his Gen-Y body, and prefers not to get caught up in ilgst or intemal dramas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he hm fun while making movies, even if co-stars like Morse ('The Crossing Guard,"'The Green Mile") need to work another way. "He's one of the best character actors funerica has," says LaBeouf of Morse. "It was tough to be on set with him, though, because he's Method and was into his thing We didn't talk for two months, that was part of his joumey.? The next part of LaBeouf's journey is hosting "Saturday Night Live" this week. . "When you start in this industry there are a few things you dream about: An Academy Awrd, Scorsese, Spielberg and 'SNL.' I'm 20 md two of those four things are off my list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's nuts!" o</p>
