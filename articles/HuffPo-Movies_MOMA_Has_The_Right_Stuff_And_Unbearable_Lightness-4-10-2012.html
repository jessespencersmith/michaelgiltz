                <p>Culture Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Follow Movies , NASA , Video , Museum Of Modern Art , The Right Stuff , The Unbearable Lightness Of Being , Film Adaptations , Moma , Philip Kaufman , The Right Stuff Film , The Unbearable Lightness Of Being Film , Culture NewsReact Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdMovies: MOMA Has The Right Stuff (And Unbearable Lightness ) Certain movies simply must be seen on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When people say that, they're usually referring to aspectacle, a widescreen epic like Lawrence of Arabia or 2001: A Space Odyssey. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly the case with The Right Stuff , a terrific 1983 look at the U.S. space race and the Mercury astronauts at the heart of it.Cutting edge special effects, brilliant acting, the desire tocapture America at a particular point in time -- The Right Stuff is a grand film that deserves the silver screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's just as true for movies that are ambitious in their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Unbearable Lightness of Being is the other masterpiece from director Philip Kaufman and both of them are being screened this week at MOMA, with Kaufman in attendance both Wednesday and Thursday night to introduce these two movies(along with Walter Murch at the Right Stuff screening, one of the team of editors that worked on that film).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love both these movies and yet I haven't seen them in many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? No matter how big my TV may be, no matter how good my BluRay player or DVD copy, these are films I want to experience in a darkened theater with a live audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been well over a decade and I can't wait to see them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaufman is no stranger to the big screen hits: he was an integral part of creating the story for Raiders Of The Lost Ark .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, coming on the heels of a western and his (unnecessary but acclaimed) remake of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff was hotly anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some even fretted that its straight arrow presentation of astronaut John Glenn might give him an unfair advantage in the upcoming Presidential elections. (No dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronald Reagan knew how to play the President better than Glenn everwould.) Despite rave reviews and a clutch of Oscar nominations, The Right Stuff performed modestly at the box office, failing to even match its budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailer doesn't help: its rah-rah sensibility is a far cry from the movie's nuanced, subtle and complex take on these men and their mission.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) GOP Approves Abortion Ban Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in AmericaFOLLOW USArts Books Film Architecture Music TV August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA ARTS TV BLACK VOICES LATINO VOICES RELIGION COMEDY LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Bobby BowdenHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 04/10/2012 3:33 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Culture Alerts Sign UpLike 975 Like 11k Recommend 274 Like 70 Like 1k Like 4k Recommend 9k Like 7k Recommend 689More Log in Create AccountThat makes it all the more remarkable that Kaufman was given such a free rein with his next movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a remarkably intelligent film that showcased three powerhouse new talents: Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin and of course Daniel Day-Lewis hot off his one-two punch of MyBeautiful Laundrette and A Room With A View.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope someone asks Kaufman how he was ever able to get the green light to make this sexy, adult, philosophical tale about young lovers caught up in the Czechspring for a U.S. studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailer offers the promise of what every foreign film used to embody for cineastes trapped in puritanical America: sex! Of course, they came for the sex and they stayed for the philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both films are based on books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Right Stuff is based on Tom Wolfe's famed nonfiction work and Unbearable on Milan Kundera's "unfilmable" masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've seen the movie and read Kundera's book and still can't fathom how anyone would ever even attempt to turn that work into a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet somehow Kaufman did it and managedto capture the playful, essence of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is wholly faithful to the spirit of the novel by being whollytrue to its own needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither author was happy with the films made from their books, which may explain why they're authors and not filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See either film and you'll be sent right to the books they're based on (not to mention the music of Leos Janacek after Unbearable ) and find very different, rich works of art that inform the movies you've seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And see the movies if at all possible on the big screen, where their scope, their vision and above all their ideas demand to be aired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're interested, here is my original review of The Unbearable Lightness of Being back in college, along with my inclusion of the film on my best of the year list and a passing nod to The Right Stuff . (It made my 1988 list because art films took a long time to reach the rest of the country back in those days.) Kaufman's next film is an HBO movie about the fiery relationship between Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn, one of the best war correspondents there ever was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait to see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On my TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 2 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Elections 2012 News and Trends Abortion Ann Romney LDS Church Poverty Art In America Paul Ryan MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Advertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact UsRecency | Popularity Slate Articles » Comments 0 Pending Comments 0 View FAQ Comments are closed for this entry View AllYou’re Doing It Wrong: Fish Tacos Stop Asking This Real Swedish ChefAbout the Swedish Chef Death, Explained 10 Plays That Protest Power Azealia Banks Smokes A Condom, Gets Banned ricky_martin RetweetMake Room for (the New) Daddy http://t.co/Q6eIDokm via @huffingtonpost feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, many others including octopi, have human-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQh Copyright © 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL Lifestyle</p>
