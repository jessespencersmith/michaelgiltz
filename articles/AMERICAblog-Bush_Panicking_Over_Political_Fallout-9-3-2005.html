                <p>S A T U R D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 0 3 , 2 0 0 5Bush Panicking Over Political Falloutby Michael in New York on 9/03/2005 08:45:00 PMBush stayed on vacation for days after the hurricane struck --as did vice president Cheney and Condi Rice (who BEGAN hervacation after the worst natural disaster in our nation's historybattered her home state of Alabama).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush went on politicaljaunts, took more than two days to address the country andgoofed around while the waters were rising and people weredying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he finally toured the destruction, Bush jokedaround in New Orleans about his younger days of hardpartying. (Can anyone doubt Cindy Sheehan now? I wasn'tsure what to think when she said Bush acted like he was at aparty when he was supposed to be comforting grievingfamilies? I thought, "Really?" But now we've seen Bush do thevery same thing ON NATIONAL TV.)But now, now that his POLITICAL life is in danger, Bush ispanicking.As Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush spoke, Vice President Dick Cheney and KarlRove, the president's senior political adviser, listened on thesidelines, as did Dan Bartlett, the counselor to the presidentand Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's overseer of communications strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theirpresence underscored how seriously the White Houseis reacting to the political crisis it faces.That's right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People have died because of Bush's dereliction of duty,his complete indifference to human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what does he dowhen disaster strikes? He calls in political hacks under investigationfor endangering national security and image doctors to repair thePOLITICAL damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because that's clearly all that Bush cares about.If it isn't, why did Bush stay on vacation for days while people weredying? Why did vice president Cheney stay on vacation for some SIXDAYS after the hurricane battered this country? Why did Sec. of StateCondi Rice LEAVE for vacation while New Orleans was spiraling intodespair and go to a fancy Broadway show (tickets cost $100 for theconnected and powerful people who can score them), play tennis withMonica Seles and buy obscenely expensive shoes on Fifth Avenue?Why did Sec. of Defense Donald Rumsfeld go on a political jaunt withBush to California on Tuesday instead of getting ready to send in thetroops? Kanye West was partly right when he said Bush doesn't careabout black people: Bush doesn't care about anybody but himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New CommentYou are commenting as a Guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may select one to log into: HuffPost PoliticsSteven Denlinger: Sir Knavely and the GreatStimulus Package - "I'm bitter," Sir Knavely toldme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He raised his glass and drank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His furry chinwent deep into his Tiger's Milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he set it...9 minutes ago Daily KosBaucus's Bad News Week - You don't generallythink of Max Baucus as a headline-seeking kind oflegislator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not the guy showing up everySunday on the talk shows, or getting ...10 minutes ago FiredoglakeThe Ghoulish Old Party - The Republican position ina nutshell: Most of them know there's a crisis, andthey just don't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't matter what's bestfor the country, only wh...1 hour ago Crooks and LiarsMorning Joe: Rep Tom Price Cites "Non-Partisan"Study Group Funded By Health Insurance CompanyPanning Health Care Reform - DOWNLOADS: (56)[image: Download WMV] [image: DownloadQuicktime] PLAYS: (107) [image: Play WMV][image: Play Quicktime] (h/t Shoq Value) This in...1 hour ago AMERICAblog GayE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Harris Dies - NYT: E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Harris, thebest-selling author of novels that addressedquestions of identity and sexuality among blackmen, has died, his publicist told Th...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All100 Signs $100 Same DayFree Custom Designs in 15min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No Set-up Fee We Print &amp; Ship Same Daywww.YardSignWholeSale.com AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Bush P...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/bush-panicking-over-poli... 1 of 57/24/09 10:53 PMA M E R I C A B L O G T V Visit our AMERICAblog TV site.see all 329 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod Southern Poverty LawCenter calls on CNN to A two minute explanationof the warped and cynical The economy is better.But....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge order San Diego toget rid of the seals Massive brawl in SouthKorean parliament Mormons may havesecretly baptizedNext 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Bush P...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/bush-panicking-over-poli... 2 of 57/24/09 10:53 PMEzra KleinTab Dump2 hours agoWonk RoomF-22 Killed BySeven-Meme Voltron3 hours agoNYCeveHuge victories: Maloney&amp; Pingree - Health CareHeroes, Clyburnreceives petition - video3 hours agoDaily DoseWill Doctors in theHouse, SenateInfluence Debate?4 hours agoThe TreatmentDoes the GOP ReallyHave an AlternativePlan in the Works?4 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
