"Definitely, I live my life by Phillipians 4:13: 'Do all things through Him which strengthens me,'" said Horton when I asked him if there were any Bible passages in particular thatinspired him. (I knew his faith was important to Horton, who is a Southern Baptist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exactquote from King James that he paraphrased is: "I can do all things through Christ whichstrengtheneth me.") He then pulled out a medallion hanging around his neck. "My sister gave methis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says, 'Thanks be to God who gives us the victory.' I keep my faith in the Lord knowing thatHe'll keep me safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's how I get through this sport because it's so crazy and pretty intense." We didn't have much time to talk but I started to raise the question of faith in sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, I find it absurd for athletes to praise God and give thanks for winning an event, as if God cares aboutsomeone winning the 100 meter dash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely such temporal matters are far beneath the concerns Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

Not often.), Horton gave a winning reply. "I actually did a crazy release move a couple of years ago in Vegas and smashed my face on the bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have you seen that? I hit the ground and said, 'Thank you I'm not dead," he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which leads me to archery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times uncovered a scandalous situation on the US archery team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brilliant head coach -- Kisik Lee -- has been abusing his position of trust byproseletyzing among the athletes and making those who don't follow his particular form ofevangelical Christianity deeply uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The USOC has been aware of the situation but sincethe athletes naturally are worried complaining will kill their chances on the team, the officials cangenerally turn a blind eye and say complaints have been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Story continues below advertisement Lee makes several outrageous comments, such as that he finds it harder to coach someone whodoesn't share his beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that's true, he doesn't deserve the job of coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would beunacceptable for a coach to say they find it hard to work with people of another race or gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sjust as unacceptable for a coach to say he finds it "hard" to work with someone who is a UnitarianUniversalist or Jewish or Catholic or Buddhist or -- God forbid -- an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he can't properlycoach people in archery who profess different beliefs (which should basically never come upanyway), he doesn't deserve the name "coach" and should resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee is the one being anti-religoushere, not those who would complain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee insists he can't help himself, that he naturally wants to bring people to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you don't bring people to Christ by abusing a position of trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More bizarrely, he insists that Christiansprobably make better archers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a quote that Bill Maher would love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be an effective archer, Lee said, athletes must learn to clear their heads and focus. "If you are Christian," he said, "then people can have that kind of empty mind." Asked if people of other faiths could learn to focus in the same way, Lee said he was not sure. "Maybe," he said. "But for me this is the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So that's why I'm encouraging people to be the same as me." Huh? Christians make better archers? What's the breakdown? Do evangelicals do better thanCatholics? Do members of United Church of Christ get 7s and 8s in archery while Episcopalians hitmore 10s? Maybe Lee should go see Bill Maher's documentary Religulous for penance: none of the US archers medaled at the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, Horton scored a terrific silver medal in the horizontal bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I'm sure one of the first thoughts running through his mind was, "Thanks be to God whogives us the victory." I believe the role of faith in sports should be simply to help you win with humility and lose with grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God does NOT care about sporting events and doesn't waste His time deciding who will win,who will lose, who will get a career-ending injury and who will use their defeat to come back fouryears later and stick a landing for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what do you think? When athletes point to the sky after winning an event and give all praise to God, are they just righteously giving the credit where credit is due? Or are they confusing personalglory and accomplishments with what really matters? Do you find it annoying or inspiring? More in Entertainment...

But then you say that their faith "may have given them an extra doseof oomph to make it happen." That still sounds exacty like saying people of stronger faith aemore likely to win a gold medal in doubles ping poing than people of lesser faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't thatseem silly? That yur faith can help you succeed in curling or synchronized diving orbadminton? And again, praying for another chance to win at badiminton -- another chance frwhat, personal glory? -- seems hardly the point of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like praying before you pull thelever on the slot machine in Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just don't think God cares at all and I believe heathenscan kick my ass in wrestling or crew or BMX mountain biking no matter how hard I train and pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I hope more athletes have your modest perspective than what I fear: that they believe God really DOES want them to win a sporting event, which really trivializes God and faith in my book. provgrays See Profile I'm a Fan of provgrays permalink Many athletes are worshipping themselves when they prance around pointing to the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm especially bothered by football players who drop to one knee in the end zone after scoring a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isclearly a personal display and is often about calling attention to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not up to me to say who is sincere in these displays and who is not, but in most cases, it appears to be ego, not faith. goodgravy See Profile I'm a Fan of goodgravy permalink in my crazy effed up family if something good happens to you then you praise god. if something bad happens then you blame the devil. it's a very convenient avoidance mechanism for people who can't think for themselves or accept any personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KarlAdam See Profile I'm a Fan of KarlAdam permalink I often wonder whether athletes making such a show of their personal beliefs on camera realize howoffensive their behavior looks to many Christians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As if they were thanking God for a personal favor,preferring them over their fellow competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't come across very Christian to the viewers forsure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dave24 See Profile I'm a Fan of Dave24 permalink 100% Roger TQ See Profile I'm a Fan of Roger TQ permalink The writer of this article brings up some good questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I used to wonder the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:07 PM on 08/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:33 PM on 08/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:46 PM on 08/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:47 AM on 08/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:51 AM on 08/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:55 PM on 08/22/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:22 PM on 08/25/2008Michael Giltz: God And Man At The Olympics http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/god-and-man-at-the-olympi_b_120460.html [4/5/2009 1:41:02 PM] See Michael Giltz's Profile Why do people say, "I just want to give God the glory" after they do something like that - when God isn't here? But isn't God the source? He has created us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We don't createourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God puts the talent and desire in us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gives us the breath to wake up in themorning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gives us the ability to practice, improve, and excel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giving God the glory andthanking Him isn't saying that God is taking sides and rooting for one person over another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'ssimply acknowledging that God DOES CARE and IS INTIMATELY involved in our lives as Hehas created us and given us the ability to do these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for reading Roger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But my belief is that God doesNOT care in the least about the 4x100 relay or doubles ping pong or the Super Bowl or any other worldly event like sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine God caring in the least for somethingso transitory, except that earthly glory and fame and wealth could endanger our soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God has given us the ability to swim or run but that's noimportant than the fact that God has given us the ability to spit or tie our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, but so what? Why would God care in the least about such silly, unimportant things we do to entertain ourselves on this earth? Why would God care who wins the Super Bowl any more than a parent would care which little boy builds a biggersandcastle? You'll cheer both children and pat them on the head but never think fora moment that such a thing matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if one boy praised God for his lump ofsand, you'd think it was cute or silly but obviously absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All wondering See Profile I'm a Fan of wondering permalink Prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prove god gave you anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you can't, then you are just making it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All joggle See Profile I'm a Fan of joggle permalink From Jonathan Horton's hometown paper(http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/sports/5952771.html ): --- He began, as always, with a prayer. "It"s a sort of "don"t let me die kind of thing,"" he said, laughing. "Today, it was "just give me strength, give me endurance.' I pray for safety and the strength I need and the precision I need to get through the routine." ---Understandable given the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twopennygal See Profile I'm a Fan of Twopennygal permalink I find it very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example: When the runner who just won the silver says that she didn't win the gold because God didn't want her to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Give me a break! She won the silver because that was whatshe was capable of when she ran that race against the field she ran against. dctackett See Profile I'm a Fan of dctackett permalink it's the buddy christ syndrome, all of your successes are because christ is on YOUR side, all of yourlosses are ignored or thought of as, "ah, the big JC was trying to teach me something"...there are not magical superpowered being floating around helping people win games... or run faster, orjump higher, or swing around on a bar better than someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People who actually believe this aredelusional, maybe it helps some by taking the responsibility/stress off of them... but really, if they won itis because they did better at that moment that their other person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:48 AM on 08/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:54 AM on 08/24/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:30 PM on 08/23/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:41 PM on 08/22/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:06 PM on 08/22/2008Michael Giltz: God And Man At The Olympics http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/god-and-man-at-the-olympi_b_120460.html [4/5/2009 1:41:02 PM] they should credit themselves, they are the ones that played a better game or what not...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a gymnast won and was being interviewed and said "I'd like to thank the gymnastics fairy for givingme the strength to win." it would be HUGE, and they would be ridiculed to all ends... replacegymnastics fairy with "god" or "jesus" or "christ" and somehow it's ok... imfedup See Profile I'm a Fan of imfedup permalink What happens when there are Christians on both sides of the competition? Is he saying God has todecide in every single contest on earth, with all of the athletic competition going on every moment ofevery day SOMEWHERE, who He is going to "help" win THIS TME? That seems like a lot of trivial decisions to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree that His time could be better spent elsewhere . . . violettefemme See Profile I'm a Fan of violettefemme permalink I have often shared similar thoughts...when I hear a football player/actor/singer/oscar winner thank god and say it was god's doing, I just have to think "Yeah, that's right, there are children going to bed sick,hungry, abused, molested or orphaned in every city, in every country in the entire world, but yeah,god's watching the Superbowl and putting everything he/she has into YOUR team winning" Yeap....exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for a great essay on this, but it will never reach those who really need to read it. tsw22 See Profile I'm a Fan of tsw22 permalink The photo you have coordinated with this article is misleading, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am almost positive that Tina Thompson is blowing a kiss to her 3-year-old son in the stands, and her family and friends, and hergesture has nothing whatsoever to do with any deity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may owe her an apology for mis-using herimage in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand -- thank you for realizing that there are women playing basketballat the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tomorrow they will play for their FOURTH straight gold medal. (They actually WON inAthens... but all anyone heard about was the men LOSING) So some props to the women would be most appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go USA!
