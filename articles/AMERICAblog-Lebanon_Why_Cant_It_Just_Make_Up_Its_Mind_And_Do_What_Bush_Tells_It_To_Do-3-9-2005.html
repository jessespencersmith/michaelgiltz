                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , M A R C H 0 9 , 2 0 0 5Lebanon: Why Can't It Just Make Up Its MindAnd Do What Bush Tells It To Do?by Michael in New York on 3/09/2005 08:57:00 PM"The Daily Show w Jon Stewart" calls the Middle East MessO'potamia, and with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It truly is a troubled region,even though Bush has been crowing for the last few weeks thatbaby steps in the Palestinian territory and elsewhere count asvindication for invading Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when Democrats don'texplode with enthusiasm or suggest the region is morecomplicated than Bush wants to admit, they're lambasted onthe Sunday talk shows by right wingers for being spoilsportswho "want America to fail."Reality check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush cheered when demonstrators in Lebanondemanded Syria leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crowds equaled tens of thousands, animpressive number since Syrian troops still basically controlthat country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But yesterday, Hezbollah organized ademonstration of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS saying Syria iswelcome and the US should butt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, the Lebaneseassembly re-elected the pro Syrian prime minister who wasforced to resign a few days ago.Everyone says Hezbollah is the best organized group and hasthe best military outfit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's gaining strength in office andshould pick up more seats in the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will Bush cheerthis terrorist organization if it reflects the will of the people?Given what he's done in Latin America (by supporting coupsagainst democratically elected leaders he thought were tooleftist), I'm guessing no.This doesn't mean the majority of the Lebanese want Syria tostay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it would be silly to claim the majority categoricallywant them to leave after yesterday's mass protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some havesuggested Hezbollah has hurt itself long-term by aligning withSyria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly the intellectual elite and the upper and middleclass want it gone -- that's why their smaller demonstrationswere termed part of the BMW revolution.Bush faces the same problem in Iraq, where horse-tradingamong the groups that can't wait to take their pound of fleshout of the Sunni minority that dominated the country for agesstill hasn't resolved whether Iraq will be merely influenced ordominated by the Koran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's Afghanistan, whichaccording to many reports has devolved into a narco-statewhere a good third of the country is controlled by war lords anddrug dealers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opium production is at near-record levels.The only good news lately is from the Palestinian territories,where the real breakthrough came because Arafat died, notbecause of Bush's global savvy.None of this is pessimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The elections in Iraq were animportant symbolic event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But stable democracies take a longtime to put down roots (as we've seen in Central and SouthAmerica, where Bush's cynical manuevering has UNDERCUTdemocracy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bush can't continue to claim democracy as hisfirst goal when his closest allies there are Saudi Arabia andPakistan.So stop crowing over minor steps, Bush, before you have to eat Ben SmithObama: Cambridge police acted 'stupidly' - Afterspending most of an hour patiently reiterating hisarguments for changing the health insurancesystem, President Barack Obama turned his press4 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsThe Wrong Reporter Asks Obama A Question - Thechance to ask a question during a prime-timepresidential press conference is treasured realestate in the world of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when thePresident...12 minutes ago Paul KrugmanProfessor in chief - I found Obama's health carepresentation so impressive - so much command ofthe issues - that it had me worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I really like apoliticians' speech, is...24 minutes ago EschatonObama Speaks - In Case You Missed It33 minutes ago Daily KosWaterloo, But for Who?
