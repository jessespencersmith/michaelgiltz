                <p>T U E S D A Y , A U G U S T 1 0 , 2 0 0 4Porter Goss's Recordby Michael in New York on 8/10/2004 11:19:00 AMPorter Goss has a great record -- of defending Bush and carryingwater for the administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He poo-pooed the idea that there was aneed for an investigation into the outing of a CIA operative thatendangered the lives of people who had risked their lives to provideinformation to our country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As far as he was concerned, there was noevidence to suggest that the leaking of the info to reporters had beenwillful."Somebody sends me a blue dress and some DNA, I'll have aninvestigation," Goss said at the time. (Hey, that's two Democraticslams at once! Nice job.) Of course, if you don't investigate, therewon't be any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One might make a reasonable objection to aninvestigation on such a serious issue -- let's not forget, we haveevery reason to believe there is a felon in the White House thatshould go to jail for this crime and Bush doesn't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This gratuitiousslam indicates Goss's cavalier attitude towards national security andthe safety of our agents and their contacts.Recently, Goss got on the floor of the Congress to belittle John Kerryand claim he was weak on intelligence -- perfectly reasonablepartisan politics, but not the sign of someone who would gain broadsupport when a quick and timely transition is so imperative.Senator Pat Roberts, the Republican head of the Senate SelectCommitte on Intelligence assumed Goss wouldn't be nominatedbecause top Democrats objected to Goss as too partisan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robertsdidn't agree with them but thought it was too important to movequickly to get into a dragged-out partisan fight.“My only message to the White House is if they do this, make it anextraordinary person that will get bipartisan support," said Roberts."My criterion for it is that the intelligence director should be someonewho has a lot of information-management experience because that’swhat it’s all about.”In June, Goss blasted George Tenet and the C.I.A. via his committee'sreport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isn't everyone? Yes, but Goss's complaint was unique: theC.I.A., Goss says, spends TOO MUCH time focusing oncounterterrorism.Goss was a sponsor of Patriot II, which would give the governmentthe right not only to secret grand juries but secret arrests of UScitizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is widely seen by critics as a hand-puppet of DickCheney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who will he report directly to: Condi Rice as would betraditional? One big warning sign of further politicization of the C.I.A.would be if he reports instead to Dick Cheney.Finally, as head of the House Intelligence Committee, he is one of theprincipal people directly responsible for the shameful lack of oversightthat led to both 9/11 and the shoddy, misleading evidence used tobolster Bush's determination to invade Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Goss was part of theproblem, why would he be part of the solution?
