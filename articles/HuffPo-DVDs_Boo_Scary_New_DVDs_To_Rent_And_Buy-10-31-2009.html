Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyBoo! Scary New DVDs To Rent And Buy Read More: Dvds , Halloween , Scary Movies , Entertainment News Heading out to the video store and looking for some DVDs to rent or buy? Here's a roundup of recent releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can always, of course, rent The Bride Of Frankenstein or Psycho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why not take a gander atthese less obvious choices? DRAG ME TO HELL ($29.98 and $39.98 BluRay; Universal) -- Until Paranormal Activities came out, this was unquestionably the most notable horror film of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still probably the best reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Universal had unreasonable expectations for this B movie horror fest in the best Sam Raimi tradition about Alison Lohman getting cursed by a nasty old woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At $80 million worldwide and a long DVDhistory ahead of it, it's a strong performer for the genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it might be the perfect break for Raimi so hecan get his Spidey sense tingling again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ORPHAN ($28.98 or $35.99 on BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- I'm not sure why it is -- I'm not adopted myself -- but I have a serious aversion to films where adopted children turn out to be the spawn of hell/untrustworthy/ungrateful/just plain mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seriously, if people listened to Hollywood, it would be a miracle if a single kid was ever taken into someone's home ever again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even a top-notch cast -- PeterSarsgaard and Vera Farmiga -- can't gussy this one up into anything beyond it's predictable arc of the orphan from hell (though in this case, that's hardly a cliche).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; P ($19;95; Palisades Tartan/Asia Extreme) -- Only hardcore fans of horror would know about the distinction between Thai horror and, say, Korean horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this entry about a young girl taught the dark arts who is forced into working at a go-go club (not a good combination if MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 BIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | LeAnn Rimes | Levi Johnston | Movies | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Passes Senate Procedural Vote Don't Miss Tonight's Rare Full Moon Eclipse Sarah Palin Jabs Michelle Obama's Anti-Obesity Campaign Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our Time PHOTOS: 10 Things We've Accidentally Learned From Crime Dramas Timothy Karr Obama FCC Caves on Net Neutrality -- Tuesday...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: 13 Products Most Likely To Be Made By Child Or Forced Labor John Boehner Strikes BackLOG IN | SIGN UP Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Like 40K Like 37K Like 5K Like 10K Like 1K Like 7K Recommend 3K you're a customer) is a cut above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILLIAM CASTLE FILM COLLECTION ($80.95; Sony) -- If you're like me and you enjoy being scared (but not that much) and don't really care for gore (even a little) this boxed set is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Castle is more of a Barnum-type showman than a good director, so the eight flicks in this set (along with asubstantial documentary about Castle himself).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His promotions were often better than the filmsthemselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One tagline said: "If it frightens you to death, you'll be buried free of charge!" But The Tingler with Vincent Price, the ridiculous 13 Ghosts, and Joan Crawford in Strait-Jacket are all good for a laugh when they don't spook you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decent extras scattered throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE OBJECTIVE ($19.98; IFC/MPI) -- On the off chance that your main desire is to actually see a good movie, give The Objective a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Special Forces team is sent into the mountains of Afghanistan after a rogue cleric when they stumble upon an ancient evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a genuine B movie that garnered some good reviews for the clever premise and a relatively unknown cast (Jon Huertas, Matt Anderson) thatkeeps you blissfully unaware of who might survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Daniel Myrick, the director of The Blair Witch Project and a man who might have some useful tips for the folks behind Paranormal Activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE SEASON TWO ($39.99; Paramount) -- Maybe you prefer your horror in bite-sized bits? This anthology series from the mid-Eighties -- like most anthology TV shows -- featured actors on their way up or on their way down and directors who loved the genre or couldn't getany other type of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Invariably, there are some standouts in the 24 episodes, though the show is farfrom a classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't help that music rights proved too expensive and they have reportedly rescored half the episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who's actually a fan of the show and remembers the originals will undoubtedly feel cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CRAFT ($24.95 on BluRay; Sony) -- An obvious precursor to the hit TV series Charmed, this is a goofier, nastier spin closer to Heathers with the outcasts of a high school ready to use dark magic to get their revenge and to hell with the consequences (not to mention their souls).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fairuza Balk has fun and Robin Tunney will be a draw for fans of the TV show The Mentalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's Neve Campbell who anchorsthis silliness with by taking it all very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GATE MONSTROUS SPECIAL EDITION ($19.98; LionsGate) -- Long available only in a cropped version, this cult hit from 1987 is finally offered in widescreen in what appears to be a newly remastered print with the usual extras like a commentary track and brief making-of featurettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A young Stephen Dorff stars in this tale of kids who unintentionally open a gate to hell, releasing some demonswho wreck serious havoc in their town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Gremlins (but less satirical), it's genuinely scary but meant for teens and is not particularly violent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE KILLING ROOM ($19.95; Genius) -- If you find the horror-porn of Saw unpleasant, you might 1 of 5 Billie Jean King Repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Is a Big Deal Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our TimeDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS amber portwood giuliana and bill johnston in playgirl miley cyrus lap dance video sarah palin michelle obama Against Sarah Palin Amanda Knox Court Makes Crucial Ruling More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Like 248 Like 155 Ask Steven Tyler a Question!

Then this romantic ghost story may be just the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Pattinson (now where have I heard of him before?) stars as a British WW II soldier who is wounded and sent to a rambling old mansion to recuperate, only to be haunted by ghosts! Better than vampires, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julian Sands (always reliably creepy even if he's playing a good guy) and Rachael Stirling costar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEFT BANK ($24.98; IFC/MPI) -- Roman Polanski may not be working for a while, but this spin on Rosemary's Baby should keep him uppermost in the mind of horror buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, a world-class runner (Eline Kuppens) is forced to stop training and recuperate from a knee infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She impulsively moves in with her boyfriend Bobby, a handsome member of an archery club that has been around since the Middle Ages and...well, ancient groups with medieval ties never have an athlete's best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCARE TACTICS SEASON THREE PART ONE ($29.98; Warner Bros.) -- OK, you don't really want to be scared at all, but you don't mind if OTHER people get scared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then dig into the SyFy (god, I hate that new name) prank show built around horror and sci-fi angles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hosted by Tracy Morgan, you can watch as a babysitter finds a psycho invading her home, a freakish creature gets loose in a lab and so on.For the folks who think there's not enough screaming during America's Funniest Home Videos. --30-- Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE TO READERS: I was provided with a final copy of every DVD reviewed in this column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, I refuse to review DVDs based on streaming videos available online or advance DVD test discs since it'simpossible to verify the quality of the picture, sound, menus, extras and other features that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I receive many more DVDs each week than I could ever cover and typically, I don't guarantee coverage for any DVD that is sent to me, merely that I will consider it for coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Vince Vaughn's New Bundle of Joy Paris Hilton's BikerBlunder Scarlett and Ryan's DinnerDate MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER NBA Video Poverty Health 30 Rock Immigration Death &amp; Dying Islam ChristianityHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESTracy Morgan Undergoes Kidney Transplant 86 Comments PHOTOS: Paris Hilton Dons Leather Bodysuit 128 Comments Guess Who Got A Tattoo Of Her Daughter 750 Comments Pantsless Chloe Sevigny 'Needs Therapy' For Vincent Gallo Sex Scene 515 Comments Beneath the Feathers: What 'Black Swan' Says About Dancers 36 Comments Nicolas Cage Buys Pyramid Tomb 135 CommentsThis Blogger's Books from Comments 0 Pending Comments 0View FAQShania Twain Engaged To Frederic Thiebaud'The Fighter' Star Amy Adams Talks Weight...Megan Fox In A Bikini (PHOTOS)Kardashian Christmas Card: The 'SNL' Spoof (VIDEO)MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2010 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recency | PopularityComments are closed for this entry View All</p>
