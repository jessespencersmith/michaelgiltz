                <p>Coffeehouses: The New Generation .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Giltz Pop music can be frightfully dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hit singles are played ad nauseam over the airwaves and on MTV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eventually, even the songs you originally liked become tiresome and mundane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most bar bands also must resign themÂ­ selves to playing covers of those very same Top 40 hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The precious few that do get a chance to play original music often compete with noisy crowds and people who, when thinking of licks, do not think of guitars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The person longing for direct contact with an artist, the person who is searching for meaningful music, the' person who thinks thrash is trash, must think there is no hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tucked away in various corners of Gainesville is a string of coffeehouses; plaÂ­ ces where musicians can share their music with small, intimate, interested crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The emphasis is on acoustic music and the atmosphere is laid back and friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unencumbered by disinterested drinkers and commercial pressures, coffeehouses are Gainesville's alternative to alternative music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On any given night, you're likely to hear everything from folk and rock classics to traditional Irish jigs -all spiced with healthy doses of original songs penned by the performers . "The performers really seem to enjoy playing there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, of course, that makes their performance all the better," said Doug Hornbeck, who frequently goes to the Acrosstown Coffeehouse .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Established about three years ago, the Acrosstown Coffeehouse is the' longestÂ­ running and best-attended coffeehouse in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the first Sunday of every month, musicians perform for about 50-100 people on the stage of the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Located at 619 South Main Street in theÂ· Baird Center, the Acrosstown requests a but also because we all enjoy playing $2.50 cover charge to defray the cost of rent together," she added. and to pay the artists.

"It's a real easy place to offer your music," Beede said. "The audience is openÂ­ hearted and friendly." Like the Acrosstown Coffeehouse, the Reunion Peace Center features 15-20 minute sets featuring artists of various styÂ­ les, with the rest of the evening open to any musician who wishes to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beede thinlcs this format is ideal. "If someone's great, you're left wanting more," he explained. "If someone's not so great, well, you know they'll be gone in a few minutes." As of now, the Reunion Peace Center Coffeehouse is strictly "open mike." Any musician who arrives early and signs up is given a chance to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, according to Beede, the coffeehouse is considering a change in format that would allow it to devote half an evening to "open mike" and half an evening to a featured act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judging from the support in the local community , the coffeehou ses are fulfilling an important function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Acrosstown Coffeehouse has a mailing lisr with more than 200 names and it grows every day. "People will go out of their way to see it," said Bob Freeman, a production manager and one of the founders of the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre. "Of course, there isn't as much acoustic music on campus as there used to be," noted Alan Agresti, business manager of the Acrosstown Coffeehouse . "Ten or 15 years ago, you could walk across campus and find people playing music all along the way." Because of this absence, Agresti felt cerÂ­ tain "there was a real need for this type of music." A visit to Acrosstown on the first Sunday of any month bears him out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The theater is buzzing with a crowd of people, many of whom are regulars and know each other. "The atmosphere is very warm and friendly," Hornbeck said. "The audiences are friendly to the performers and each other." Musicians sit with friends and welIÂ­ wishers until their set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Encouraging banter. often passes between the crowd and the performers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their positive attitudes, coupled with Acrosstown's intimate surÂ­ roundings ; make you feel perfectly lit ease, as if you were sitting in someone's living room and listening to a friend pick out a tune on the guitar. see Coffeehouse, page 10 Coffeehouse festivals and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But HooYler waoted to do lOQIC'IhiDc that would involve the from page 1 eabre CIOIDIIIaoity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of ~ IIoweYer allis r..iIy iDdudcs -I told them.

"Janet bas been ,playing around here for yean, but seldom does she get a chance to have people just sit down and listen." Rucker agrees. "The coffeehouse is the only, place I get to play my original SOIIp. " Thanks to recent growth, the Acrosstown Coffeehouse is becoming even more ambiÂ­ tious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having incorporated, Agresti said it recently applied for status as 'a non-profit organization. "Eventually," Agresti said. "we bope to sponsor concert series similar to tbose done by the Gainesville Friends of Jazz." As for the moment, the coffeehouses are offering their small but loyal audiences something they can't find anywbere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, 'as Hoovler said, there's no lack of talented local artists wbo are ready and eager to perform. "I've never been to a place witb more musicians, .. he said. . "In. some cities, tbere's one musician for every 10 potential audience members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, in Gainesville, it seems like there are 10 musicians to every one audience member." "There's not much of an outlet for . b t tbere's a terrific au-acoustic mUSIC, u d "Like the f Â·tÂ·' Freeman agree . dience or Ip'le really like it when they get theater, peo , used to it."</p>
