Celebrating Peanuts Posted October 29, 2007 | 01:18 PM (EST) Read More: American Masters , Books , Charles Schulz , Charlie Brown, Comic Strips , Doonesbury , Gary Larson , Hal Hartley , Pbs, Peanuts , The Far Side , Tv, Walter Cronkite, Breaking Entertainment News Tonight on PBS's American Masters, they take a close look at the life of Peanuts creator Charles Schulz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linked to the new biography by David Michaelis, it focuses on the parallels between Schulz's real life and the strip, as well as the very real melancholy Schulz dealt with his whole life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book and this episode are both acclaimed, but personally, watching the story of an artist's life always makes me antsy - if they're important enough to write a biography or make a documentaryabout, I'd rather focus on the work that made them famous in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Peanuts, the most successful - and most successfully merchandised -- comic strip in history,that's always been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a Charles Schulzmuseum, DVDs of animated specials and of course countless reissues of the strips in book form over theyears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the most exciting and satisfying Peanuts project is the ambitious 25 volume masterpiece The Complete Peanuts being created by publisherFantagraphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've recently put out volume eight, The Complete Peanuts: 1965-1966 ($28.95; Fantagraphics), and like all the previous volumes, it's beautifully designed by graphic novelist Seth and a joy to behold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The influence of Peanuts is obvious, of course, and reflected by the range of people who've written introductions to these volumes: director Hal Hartley, novelist Jonathan Franzen, jazz artistDiana Krall and newsman Walter Cronkite are just some of the names who've revealed theirpassion for Peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's less obvious is the pleasure to be had in reading Peanuts in big gulps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comic strips are really on the lowest rung of appreciation among hardcore comic book aficionados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the heart of their love is the comic book, followed closely by the graphic novel, mangas and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, goto most comic book stores and they care more about movie spin-offs of Spider-Man than a childish comic strip, collections of which are usually relegated to a dusty bottom shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I can'ttell you how many artists and fans I've spoken to who foolishly dismiss the landmark Doonesburystrip as poorly drawn and without interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Fantagraphics took a major gamble in devoting so much time and effort to Peanuts and it's paid Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Your favorite characterdepends on your mood - I love Lucy's crabbiness one minute and Linus's sweet nature the next.But the eternal loser Charlie Brown is the heart of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read the strips one after another and you'll marvel how Schulz balanced so nimbly between the genuine concerns of childhood (the kid you have a crush on, nervousness over meeting new people, fighting with your siblings and friends) and droll comments on the wishy-washiness of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linus is watching TV and gets furious when Lucy arbitrarily turns it off, righteous in his anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then when he's exhausted his pique, Linus says to himself, "It was a lousy program anyway." When Schroeder gets annoyed by Lucy draping herself over his piano and he walks away, she barks, "THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE EMBARRASSED BY A PRETTY FACE! THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?"And in the next panel: "A PRETTY FACE MAKES YOU UNEASY, DOESN'T IT? HUH? DOESN'TIT?" And in the final panel she says reflectively, "He shouldn't feel that way....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lots of people getembarrassed in the presence of a pretty face..." It's that final panel that nudges the strip into greatness -- the way Schulz quietly shows us comforting and deluding ourselves just to get through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cultural impact of Peanuts has been ongoing for decades. (Would Christmas be the same without them?) But republishing theentire series in one gorgeous volume after another is really the first time we can truly take a stepback, appreciate his work as a whole and ultimately wrap our arms around the accomplishment ofCharles Schulz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes, happiness is a warm book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...
