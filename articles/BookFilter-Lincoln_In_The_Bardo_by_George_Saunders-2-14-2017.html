I appreciated the Barthelme-like cleverness but "appreciate" is where I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wisely, I imagined the problem was with me and planned to return to it someday soon with an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here comes his first novel and gobsmacked is the least of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the most formally daring novel I can think of since David Mitchell's "Cloud Atlas." And here that obvious intellect of Saunders is married towarmth and beauty and an all-encompassing vision of this life and the next. "Bardo" is a Tibetan word that hints at theShare This Book About The Author George Saunders MoreGeorge Saunders is the author of eight books, including the story collectionsPastoralia and Tenth of December, which was a finalist for the National Book Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has received fellowships from the Lannan Foundation, the American Academy of Artsand Letters, and the GuggenheimFoundation. ‚Ä¶ Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: February 14, 2017 Publisher: Random House Pages: 368 ISBN 10: 0812995341 ISBN 13: 9780812995343Buddhist concept of an intermediate state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It usually means that moment when your essence is flitting between one existence and the next, the period when your previous life has ended but the next one hasn't quite incarnated yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being in the bardo is an opportunity for wisdom and insight, but also a danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More broadly, it means anyone in a state of flux, perhaps due to an illness or a dramatic change in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Lincoln enters the bardo upon the death of hisbeloved son Willie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; History tells us that Lincoln rather poignantly returned again and again to the cemetery on the day ofWillie's burial, just to gaze upon and even hold his son one last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From that shred of fact, Saunders has spun out aremarkable tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins strictly with quotations from the historical record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using passages from diaries and letters and biographies and the like -- just one quote after another, each one indicating its source -- Saunders sets the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The President and his wife hold a party while their son Willie is feverish upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unexpectedly, the boy takes a turn for theworse and dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, Lincoln is broken by this and the country holds its breath, wondering if the President will shakeoff his grief and again shoulder the burden of the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aha, I thought, Saunders is going to write an entire novel bypiecing together found quotations! But no, suddenly at the cemetery other voices intrude, the voices of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an echo of the play "Our Town," we hear from the spirits still hovering nearby, the people who have some desperate unfinished business or simply retreat instinctively from the unknown afterlife to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These voices include Willie himself, a Reverendwho fears he is damned but doesn't know why, a gay man who killed himself after being rejected by his lover, an enslavedwoman who was raped to death, a drunken couple who are ferociously determined swearers, little girls, old men and on and on -- each of them with a story they want, indeed must tell and a reason for not moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Lincoln returns to visit Willie, the other spirits are astonished at such compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People don't return, not to touch certainly, not to actually hold.Yet it's not good to tarry, especially for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so a struggle ensues.The spirits want to remain but avoid admittingthe obvious fact that they are dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Willie wants to remain so he can see his father again, yet remain is precisely what heshouldn't do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see the possible fate that awaits people (terrible, frightening, glorious).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see the bitterness of lives half-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And we see Lincoln in the bardo, consumed with grief and yet offered new insight and purpose to fight and win and give a higher meaning to the bloody war, thanks to his communion with the spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a funny, vulgar, sad, fantastical,profane and philosophical novel that reaffirms what everyone else has been saying: George Saunders is a hell of a writer. --Michael Giltz What Others Say Praise for George Saunders ‚ÄúNo one writes more powerfully than George Saunders about the lost, the unlucky, the disenfranchised.‚Äù ‚Äî Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times ‚ÄúSaunders makes you feel as though you are reading fiction for the first time.‚Äù ‚ÄîKhaled Hosseini ‚ÄúFew people cut as hard or deep as Saunders does.‚Äù ‚ÄîJunot D√≠az ‚ÄúGeorge Saunders is a complete original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no one better, no one more essential to our national sense of self and sanity.‚Äù ‚ÄîDave Eggers ‚ÄúNot since Twain has America produced a satirist this funny.‚Äù ‚ÄîZadie Smith ‚ÄúThere is no one like him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is an original‚Äîbut everyone knows that.‚Äù ‚ÄîLorrie Moore ‚ÄúGeorge Saunders makes the all-but-impossible look effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We‚Äôre lucky to have him.‚Äù ‚ÄîJonathan Franzen ‚ÄúAn astoundingly tuned voice‚Äîgraceful, dark, authentic, and funny‚Äîtelling just the kinds of stories we need toget us through these times.‚Äù ‚ÄîThomas Pynchon What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
