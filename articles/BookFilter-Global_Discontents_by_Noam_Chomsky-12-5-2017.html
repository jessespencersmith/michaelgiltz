The genuine left, the left that exists in Europe and Central and South America and most of the free world? That is dismissed and ignored in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is where Chomsky comes in.He is a voice of conscience though he's too funny and sharp and pointed to strike one in such a dull, moralistic manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IShare This Book About The Author Noam Chomsky, David Barsamian Noam Chomsky is the author of numerous bestselling political works, including Hegemony or Survival and Failed States .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A professor emeritus of linguistics andphilosophy at MIT, he is widely creditedwith having revolutionized modern linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives outside Boston, Massachusetts.David Barsamian , director of the award- winning and widely syndicated AlternativeRadio, is a winner of the Lannan Foundation's Cultural Freedom Fellowship and the ACLU's Upton Sinclair Award forindependent journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives in Boulder,Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $18.00 (Paperback) Published: December 05, 2017 Publisher: Metropolitan Books Pages: 240 ISBN 10: 1250146186 ISBN 13: 9781250146182am not at the "end of capitalism" or "communitarian" stage (yet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chomsky will challenge your idea of what is possible, what is inevitable and what must be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether calling the US drone program the single greatest exporter of terror in the world (and almost unquestionably a source of growing anti-American terror) or politely suggesting Senator Bernie Sanders not term his political movement a "revolution" since it is at best a modest reform of the current system, Chomskynever fails to alter your perspective and question your base assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign policy, his childhood, the Republican Partyas debased and barely a party since it is so divorced from average voters -- Chomsky offers up thoughts on it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'llwant to read more and wish you could talk with him yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone who can be blocked one week by Israel and the next by Palestinians is obviously someone worth listening to indeed. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
