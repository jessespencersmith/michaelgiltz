(On a similar note, Jordan Dean has a very amusing running gag as Demetrius where he delivers some of his lines in a quavering, r&amp;b crooner style; a goofily funny touch that wasn't overdone.) When it sings, this Midsummer soars, but even at its most earth-bound it's an amiable night of theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four-star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Assistance ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Blood Knot at Signature ** Bob *** 1/2 Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1950 ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Carrie ** 1/2 The Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Close Up Space * Clybourne Park *** 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Damn Yankees ** Death Of A Salesman with Philip Seymour Hoffman ** 1/2 Dedalus Lounge * 1/2 Early Plays (Eugene O'Neill at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse) * End Of The Rainbow * Ernani at Met w Angela Meade *** 1/2 An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Evita * 1/2 Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Galileo with F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray Abraham ** The Gershwins' Porgy And Bess *** 1/2 Ghost The Musical * 1/2 Godspell ** 1/2 Goodbar * 1/2 Gore Vidal's The Best Man ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 How The World Began * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Hurt Village ***Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later *** 1/2 Jesus Christ Superstar * 1/2 King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** The Lady From Dubuque ** 1/2Lake Water ** Leap Of Faith ** Leo *** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 The Lyons ** 1/2 Lysistrata Jones * Magic/Bird * The Maids ** Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Maple And Vine ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park ***HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 2 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Latino Politics Natural Disasters Unemployment Facebook Miranda Kerr Anthony Weiner Meditation Student Activism MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Slate Articles Â»Death, Explained Did You See This?
