Alec's dad on the other hand seems to have done nothing worse than divorce his mom, but Alec is overwhelmed even though divorce is not usually the trauma it oncewas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So while Josie deals with her mother's creepily suspicious assistant, a staff completely indifferent to the almost brutaltreatment of Josie and her sister AND a snoopy schoolmate who just wants to pry out secrets about her mother, Alec simplymakes trips to the library and has a school pal who behaves decently from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The excitement is decidedly weighted to the past even though the chapters alternate between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, DeAngelis plays fast and loose with the magic taking place.When the ouija board becomes inaccessible, Josie and Alec simply switch to a phonograph playing wax cylinders sothey can chat away, which feels awfully convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while one doesn't need an explanation as such for every strangegoings-on, what the heck is up with that possessed doll anyway? With lazy magic rule-making, a confused jumble ofelements and a climactic plot twist that feels too easy, "The Boy From Tomorrow" wears out its welcome long before that creepy doll loses an eye. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúYou will fall in love with DeAngelis‚Äô characters and root for their impossible friendship across time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfect for fans of historical fiction, this spine-tingling paranormal novel is impossible to put down.‚Äù ‚ÄïMarika McCoola,author of the award-winning and New York Times-bestselling Baba Yaga‚Äôs Assistant (Marika McCoola) "In The Boy From Tomorrow Camille DeAngelis creates an atmosphere of comforting nostalgia without falling into old- fashioned cliches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs a carefully paced and lovingly crafted book that will draw readers for many years to come, and I enjoyed it ever so much." ‚ÄïMackenzi Lee, author of the award-winning and New York Times- bestselling The Gentleman‚Äôs Guide to Vice and Virtue (Mackenzi Lee) "Josie and Alec‚Äôs story is an unusual ghosttale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through an odd warp in time, the pair, who both live in the same house 100 years apart, can speak to eachother through a Ouija board, the wax cylinders of an old record player, and a cache of letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As they growcloser, Alec (in 2015) begins to fear that Josie (in 1915) and her younger sister, Cassie, are in danger from theirmother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The glamorous Lavinia Clifford is a wealthy spiritualist who communes with the dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also keeps her daughters virtual prisoners in their room, and often punishes Cassie cruelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alec is shaken when he finds a local grave, engraved simply Clifford, that appears to be a child‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can he convince Josie that she needs to contacther old governess and escape?
