                <p>T U E S D AY, N O V E M B E R 1 4 , 2 0 0 6"Studio 60" UpdateAaron Sorkin's drama about life on a "Saturday Night Live"-like varietyshow has been picked up for a full season, even though it continues tostruggle in the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show has settled down to about 7.5+ millionviewers a week, almost half of the lead-in from the hit "Heroes" andless than half (this week) in the coveted 18-49 demo it should flourishin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show will definitely be moved come January to a new timeslot.Sorkin complains to the Hollywood Reporter that everyone discussesratings and all that instead of the show itself. (Mind you, he neverminded people discussing the ratings when the show was "The WestWing" and the ratings were sky high.) But I decided to take him up onit and watch last night's episode.Like most people, I remain disappointed. (And of course, it's not truecritics aren't discussing the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After two or three episodes, anumber of critics weighed in and said the show's promise had beenderailed.) Several storylines: the Christian star of the show was in hotwater for saying the Bible says homosexuality is a sin, several of thecast members were locked up by a small town police force for speeding,a Japanese conglomerate was making a major investment and thestudio exec was in hot water for her ex-husband's claim that she didn'twant to have kids and would avoid hiring a woman who did have kids.As always, the show is fairly well-written and well-cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone ispretty good, led by Matthew Perry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And guest star John Goodman (as asmall town judge) was very good. (He's sure been wasted the last fewyears with not enough good roles.) The problem as always is the toneand subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half the show was spent dealing with press fallout.Matthew Perry righteously argued with his star about why she's a bigotfor objecting to gay marriage. (He was right, of course, but who cares?)Again, they're putting on a sketch comedy show but still debating themajor issues of the day as if this were the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally,every single time that we glimpse a sketch that they're working on forbroadcast or someone reads off a line of dialogue or a proposed skit, ISWEAR that EVERY SINGLE TIME the jokes are so lame I really thinksomeone is going to say, 'Boy, we've got a lot of work to do,' or 'Comeup with something better' or SOMETHING rather than "great!."Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "Studio 60" Updatehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/studio-60-update.html 1 of 37/28/09 2:37 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SAaronMichael in New YorkBiboy POPSURFING.COM: "Studio 60" Updatehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/studio-60-update.html 2 of 37/28/09 2:37 PMPOPSURFING.COM: "Studio 60" Updatehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/studio-60-update.html 3 of 37/28/09 2:37 PM</p>
