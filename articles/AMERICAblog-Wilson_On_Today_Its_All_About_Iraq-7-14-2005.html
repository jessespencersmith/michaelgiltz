                <p>T H U R S D A Y , J U L Y 1 4 , 2 0 0 5Wilson On Today: It's All About Iraqby Michael in New York on 7/14/2005 10:45:00 AMPerhaps the best part of "Today's" interview with AmbassadorJoe Wilson? His emphasis on a conspiracy and the lies theWhite House peddled to sell the war in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people fearRove is a "distraction" from the DSM et al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wilson remindsus that this is why they attacked him in the first place.Wilson emphasized that this is about the war in Iraq and thelies the White House used to sell that war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tony Blair offered upshoddily forged documents claiming the weak and enfeebledHussein was trying to buy radioactive material in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bushsent Joe Wilson to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe Wilson came back and saidit wasn't true -- the evidence didn't hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush didn't likethat answer so they sent someone else to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theycame back and said the same thing: the proof isn't there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BushSTILL didn't like that answer so they sent someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Threeseparate investigations and all three said the same thing: nogo.But Bush lied anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his State of the Union address leadingup to the war, Bush stated flatly in 16 fatal words that Husseinhad gone to Africa to buy radioactive material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson wasastonished and finally decided to come forward and speak outpublicly -- the very thing the far right just excoriated DeepThroat for not doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson knew it meant they would attackand smear him but he came forward anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those 16 words-- that lie -- became the focus of intense debate and ultimatelyJoe Wilson was vindicated: the White House admitted it didn'thave the proof to back up that claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the BushAdministration, Joe Wilson was right and they were wrong.(The other central piece of evidence -- the tubes Bush claimedwere used to make nuclear weapons -- has also been proven tobe a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One lone mid-level CIA analyst made the claim theWhite House wanted about those tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every other scientificand military group that looked at the evidence, every expertfrom the US and from international bodies and our alliesoverseas said the claims about those tubes were absolutelywrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with 99.9% of the experts saying one thing andliterally one mid-level analyst saying what they wanted to hear,Colin Powell went to the UN and statedly flatly that there wasno doubt what they were used for, which was a lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If one ofthose many, many people in the government had shown thecourage of Joe Wilson and come forward before the invasion todispute what they knew was absolutely untrue about the othercentral piece of "evidence," we might never have gone to war.But of course they knew what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The treatment ofWilson -- who came forward a few months after the invasion --proved them right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Public support and the upcoming reelectionof Bush were at stake and they attacked.)For when Joe Wilson came forward, the Bush Administrationdidn't just attack and smear him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They went after his wife aswell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they didn't just smear her; they risked nationalsecurity to out a covert CIA agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As everyone working ingovernment knows, the simple fact that someone is a covertagent for the CIA is classified information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People don't revealthat lightly to anyone and when they do, you don't tell yourfamily and you don't tell your friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And frankly, even a childknows that you don't reveal the identity of a spy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
