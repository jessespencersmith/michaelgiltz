(His adaptationThe Heir Apparent in DC this September has received strong notices as well.) It's a notable run of consistent excellence for Ives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOLLOW US Going Back To 'Titanic'PHOTOS: Celebs Entertain In The Thanksgiving...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean Paul Gaultier: From the Catwalk to the...PHOTOS: Dancing With The Stars Cast Reunites!EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; November 24, 2011 Bloody New Look From Angelina Jolie The Weirdest Commercial You'll See Thanksgiving Weekend!

She comes in off the street squawking and chattering but in the blink of an eye embodies an upper-class woman fromthe late 1800s to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's off book (that is, performing the role without consulting the script) almost the entire time, even though she claims to have just glanced at the script on her way to the audition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, she seems to know a disconcerting amount about Thomas and his private life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four or fivelikely scenarios spring to mind but the show lands on by far the least interesting and satisfying one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a deflating climax that weakens everything that came before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't let that stop you from going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because what came before is Dancy dueling with Arianda and she is indeed a presence to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arianda dominates the stage with the quicksilver changes called for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You want to burst into applause again and again throughout the show as she pulls off one marvelousturn after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bouncing in a chair across the stage in delight, curling her legs around Dancy, revealing layer and layer of intelligence and ferocity just as Vonda takes off layer and layer of clothing, Arianda is simply delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though you've been told again and again how remarkable she is, herMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
