This all explodes thanks to plot twists that pile onto each other in an especially awkward manner, each one less convincing than the last, or rather, less interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's nothing unconvincing about maritalinfidelity or having a co-worker leap you on the corporate ladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But none of it has any bearing on theweighty religious and cultural topics that Disgraced clumsily raises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It certainly isn't the fault of the cast, which is fine throughout, with Karen Pittman especially good as that co-worker of Amir's, probablybecause she's the most internally consistent character on the stage and isn't asked to suddenly turn into someone entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pittman also has an appealing warmth and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's only 90 minutes but Disgraced felt much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps when Akhtar listens to the vivid characters he can create rather than jumping them through hoops he'll deliver a longer play that feels shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare In The Park w Lily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * Testimony WATCH: U.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Dances Gangnam-Style Louisiana Woman May Have Set Herself On Fire In Dubious Race-Related Attack (UPDATED) DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Chip Davis Halloween Is a Night Like No Other Tavis Smiley The Top 20 (Cause 10 Ainâ€™t Enough) Reasons (Excuses) Black Folk Will Give if Obama Loses MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 Sponsored Links New Policy in New York 2012-Drivers w/ no DUIs eligible for up to 50% off car insurance...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TheFinanceAuthority.com "How Doctors Lose Weight" New York Celebrity Doctor Reveals His #1Trick To Lose Weight... iConsumerKnowledge.org Boost Testosterone Levels Men over 40 are seeing shocking boosts infree testosterone with this Slate Articles Â»Recommend 1k Recommend 784 Recommend 32k American Horror Story, Season 2 Is The Neighbors Really TVâ€™s WorstNew Show?
