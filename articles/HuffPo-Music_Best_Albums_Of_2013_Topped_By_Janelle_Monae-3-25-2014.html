So with a lotmore music to sift through, maybe it's no surprise I haven't felt ready to compile a list of my 40+ favorite albumsof the year until March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hey, any time is a good time to hear about new music, right? And for the past sixmonths, if you asked me what my favorite album of the year was, my answer would have been the same.Because the best album of 2013 was...Janelle Monae's The Electric Lady.Never heard of her? Well, you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Janelle Monae already has the respect of her peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's been nominatedfor six Grammys, she appeared on the #1 hit single "We Are Young" by fun, Prince called her newest album hisfavorite of the year , she toured with Bruno Mars, she's a CoverGirl spokesmodel (hey, anything to get yourname and face out there!), Erykah Badu and Miguel and Esperanza Spalding are among the talent appearing onher album and that masterpiece ranked at #8 on the Village Voice Pazz and Jop poll of the best albums of theyear among critics (only Beyonce scored higher among women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's also performing Thursday March 27 onAmerican Idol if you want to catch a glimpse of her chops in concert.Maybe her deceptively simple new single from the soundtrack to the animated film Rio 2 will be the one to breakher out.I'm not sure exactly what will break Janelle Monae out but I am certain it's going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her debut TheArchArachnoid was in my Top 10 of the best albums from 2010 and her newest CD tops my list for 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Princeis a great reference point, as is Stevie Wonder, Erykah Badu and a host of other artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monae can seeminglydo anything and she is determined to prove it: her new album contains instrumental passages akin to a filmscore, has a sci-fi concept (very minimal) in which androids are the new despised minority, gently tweaks radiodeejays with amusing inter-song skits and jumps all over the map stylistically from 1950s torch singing to purepop to classic rhythm and blues to fierce, committed raps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She'll make your head spin, your toes tap, your mindrace and your lips say again and again with pleasure and excitement, "Who IS this??""Ghetto Woman" is wonderfully catchy until it catches you up short with some righteous indignation over anyonewho would blithely condemn women fighting to survive under economic straits. "Dorothy Dandridge Eyes" is anawesome tip of the hat to that iconic actress. "Dance Apocalyptic" is the great hit single that wasn't, so infectious12/12/2015Why Janelle Monae Is About to Be Your Favorite New Artist | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=12fa294a-7f45-485d-9b1e-3c5d1f23ed45&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4future generations will be astonished it didn't top the charts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And none of that even capturesthe ambition, the humor, the sheer nutty expansiveness of what she's accomplished on The Electric Lady.Here's "Q.U.E.E.N." with Badu:Here's "Prime Time" with Miguel:It's just my favorite from a year that -- as always -- produced a lot of great music in a lot of different genres.Shame on me for not hearing more jazz and classical, but you can find great pop, rock, soul, country, folk, a littleworld and some works that can't be categorized except as "great." Linda Thompson delivered maybe her bestsolo album yet, Arctic Monkeys did the same across the pond (ask most Brit critics and they'd pick AM as thebest of the year), Vampire Weekend proved they're in it for the long haul, Bob Dylan dug into the vaults for yetanother gem (as did The Waterboys!), Bombino had the world music album to beat, The Lone Bellow broughtAmericana to Brooklyn and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's so much great music to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm certain your list would bedifferent, but share it below! And check out some of the music I list here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're a fan of the genre, chancesare you'll find something well worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the bottom, you'll find some early favorites from 2014 and alink to my master list of the Best Albums Of All Time, with my favorite from each year and top picks going backto the early 1920s!
