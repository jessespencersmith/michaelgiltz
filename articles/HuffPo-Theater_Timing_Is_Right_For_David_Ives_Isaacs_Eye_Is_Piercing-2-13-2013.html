                <p>Theater: Timing Is Right For David Ives; Isaac's Eye Is Piercing ALL IN THE TIMING *** out of **** ISAAC'S EYE *** out of **** ALL IN THE TIMING *** out of **** PRIMARY STAGES I missed All In The Timing when it premiered 20 years ago (at Primary Stages, appropriately).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The David Ives evening of one acts was one of those shows you kick yourself for not catching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ran and ran, so you had no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ives has gone on to a very interesting, sometimes brilliant career that completely justified the hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But of course nothing burnishes a show's reputation quite like never seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, here we are 20 years later and the one acts that were just amusing titles -- "Variations on the Death of Trotsky" and "Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread," for example-- finally come to life and are essentially worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some pieces feel like theperformances are better than the work; most feel like the one acts could be delivered evenmore tightly and smartly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a genial night of entertainment with Ives and his wit onfull display thanks to a game cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The showstopper is unquestionably "Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread," an inspired bit of nonsense that ably spoofs Glass and Robert Wilson yet works perfectly well even for those unfamiliar with their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the tech elements are at their peak here, from the setdesign of Beowulf Boritt (a nicely skewed perspective with four doors that here isaugmented by a spare, uber-bakery) to the lighting of Jason Lyons (always deft at settingmood and tempo, an under-appreciated element in skits like these) to the costumes ofAnita Yavich (having fun here) and the hair and wigs of Tom Watson (who adorns CarsonElrod with the perfect Glassian mop of hair).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I personally appreciated the cleverness of "Sure Thing," which shows two people meeting cute -- every time one of them stumbles into something inappropriate, a buzzer chimesand they get a do-over until everything turns out right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But whether it's the silliness of"The Philadelphia" or the nutty conceit of "Words Words Words" (in which monkeys arelocked in a room with the hope that they'll eventually write Hamlet ), Ives is consistently working on a level of lowbrow collegiate humor a la Monty Python, which is high praise inmy book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is strong throughout but Jenn Harris scores repeatedly, such as the surly waitress in "The Philadelphia" and Carson Elrod shines throughout and is missed when he doesn'tappear in the final sketch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are the heart of the richest one act, "The Universal Language." In it, Harris is Dawn, a lonely woman with a stutter who has stumbled into a continuing education course thatpromises to teach people an Esperanto-like universal language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her teacher Don (Elrod)dives right into absurd gibberish that she proves adept at understanding and she (and we) soon glom onto every goofy, made-up phrase with glee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a criticism of the other pieces to say they don't have the depth and heart of this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dawn probably has nowhereelse to go and is delighted to discover she doesn't stutter in this new language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don is aMay 1, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 02/13/2013 2:19 amwould-be con artist who can't bring himself to dupe this sweet person he's falling for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elrod and Harris easily capture the pathos and emotion while never missing a laugh on the silliness pouring out of their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ives might have stuck with just sketch comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this piece pointed the way forward to a career that has blossomed recently with his marvelous adaptation of Moliere called The School for Lies, the Tony-winning Venus in Fur and the brilliant play of ideas, New Jerusalem, a work that ranks with Michael Frayn's Copenhagen as one of the smartest and most satisfying dramas in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director John Rando might have tightenedthings up and focused this or that moment even more in All In The Timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was still a pleasure to see where it all began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ISAAC'S EYE *** out of **** ENSEMBLE STUDIO THEATREIf you don't think a debate about whether light behaves like a particle or a wave can make for good theater, then you've never seen gripping, brilliant plays of ideas like MichaelFrayn's Copenhagen or David Ives' New Jerusalem , works which take the world of ideas (be they scientific or religious) and make them come alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the promising playwright Lucas Hnath certainly didn't stumble when he decided to turn the historical fact of Isaac Newton sticking a needle into his eye -- in order to, perhaps,test one of his theories -- into a play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hnath only stumbles when he veers away from thisdebate and settles for plot machinations of a more pedestrian nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't happen until act two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this first act, the audience is thoroughly engaged by the drama of a young, unknown Isaac Newton pleading his case with Robert Hooke to gain admittance into the Royal Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It turns out that obscure, young Newton has alighted on similar topics as the brilliant and famous Hooke and is offering up remarkableinsights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hooke is none too pleased but can't help sparring with Newton over his ideaseven as Hooke tries to put the lad off so the Great Man can publish his own results first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hnath is so good in this first act I was certain I was watching one of the best plays of theyear, even though it's only February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The four-person cast and director Linsay Firmanwere perfectly in sync with his skill, which is exactly what happens when good actorscombine with good writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hnath immediately sets a playful but intellectual tone with an engaging narrator (the excellent Jeff Biehl, who also doubles as a man dying of leprosy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The narrator tells the audience about Newton and his erroneous belief in ether as a disarming way of saying thisshow may have some facts wrong but it's all in service of a higher truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And just to keepthings clear, when the show does offer some facts up that are, in fact, facts, why he'll writethem on the chalkboard so we'll know they're so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Details like the fact that Newton oncethreatened to burn his parents' house down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or the fact that Newton did indeed once sticka needle in his eye, though no one is quite sure why.And we're off, meeting Newton and -- this is actually quite difficult to do -- being immediately convinced of his genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As written and performed so well by Haskell King, Newton is what we today would blithely describe as a little Asperger-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's utterlyfocused on his work and not quite able to relate socially to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His only friend is theappealing and emotionally savvy Catherine (captured to a "t" by Kristen Bush).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She seemsa perfect helpmate to Newton and he's happy to have her come along when he moves toLondon to pursue his work, which has to happen after he gets into the Royal Society,which has to happen because Robert Hooke has to recognize his genius, which has tohappen because he is a genius and knows it and needs to do his work! Catherine on the other hand, clearly loves Isaac but needs to determine once and for all if she's useful to him like a stool, comforting to him like a pet or actually important to him like a love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether Newton can feel that love and -- even if he can feel that love -- whether he can express it, is the heart of the drama in this first act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a crisis precipitated by the arrivalof Hooke (Michael Louis Serafin-Wells, good like everyone else), a noted lothario whosuddenly senses a soul mate in the perceptive Catherine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He might -- to his shock -- havefound a reason for settling down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All this drama is interwoven beautifully with Newtonand Hooke debating light and color and what we now know as the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sfunny, moving and quite thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act two is not a crushing disappointment; let's not go that far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the play moves away from the scientific debate at its heart and devolves into blackmail and subterfuge, all tofar less interesting effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though the show has been marvelously concentrated on scienceand a distant era captured with theatrical flair, it sacrifices all that with a surreal touchwhere Newton has a needle stuck in his eye for a month, a deflating bit of pointlessnessthat undercuts the reality Hnath created with such ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine moments can still be found, such as Biehl pleading for his humanity while Newton and Hooke poke and probe at the dying man or Bush navigating the emotions of two mendriven by the need to explore ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That need is so overwhelming it's either completely selfish or completely selfless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's pretty certain that such distinctions won't matter to the woman being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can still strongly recommend Isaac's Eye for an excellent ensemble molded beautifully by their director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And clearly Hnath is a talent to watch, one good enough to make the exceptional promise of the first act shine much brighter than the modest let-down of thesecond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare in the Park withLily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
