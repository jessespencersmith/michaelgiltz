Who cares? Is it good? That's all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foolishnessof labels has never been more apparent than in the astonishing career of M.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anderson, who has produced a stringof sophisticated, witty works under the label of "young adult." That term has covered his dystopian sci-fi, horror,contemporary teen, historical fiction and now this work of biography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since "young adult" also encompasses themasterpiece "Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn," as complex and involving a work as there is, he should happilyembrace it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essentially, "young adult" means there is (probably) a young adult at the heart of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet,"young adult" indicates one initial audience for this work and that may explain why it's so particularly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andersonhas especially wowed with "Feed" and his landmark two volume work "The Astonishing Life Of Octavio Nothing,"fiction that captures the Revolutionary Era, shines a fresh light on the horrors of slavery and presents our nation'sfounding from such a novel perspective readers may never think of it in quite the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's intenselydetailed and utterly convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So now we have a work of nonfiction about composer Dimitri Shostakovich and howhe created his Seventh Symphony during the Siege of Leningrad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a delight; no surprise since Anderson hasevinced an enthusiasm for music almost as joyful as Shostakovich's love of soccer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What makes this book so good isthat Anderson doesn't simplify the tale for its presumed audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he does CLARIFY the story in an elegantmanner that any historian or biographer should envy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With seeming ease, Anderson tells of Shostakovich's life, theunceasing terror of Stalin's reign, the invasion of Germany, the horrors of the siege, cannibalism, despair and the roleof music and why it mattered so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also deftly captures the moral complexity of Shostakovich's life,surrounded as he was by friends and family who were murdered by the state or turned against him to protectthemselves or depended on him for their survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A children's book? Hardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And definitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any lover of good historyor classical music or a tale well told should embrace this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Memorable scenes abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musicians in thebesieged Leningrad, trying to rehearse the symphony but fainting from hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shostakovich called for an interviewby officials, convinced that finally he was going to be executed like so many others before him, only to discover hisinterviewer had himself been arrested and thus Shostakovich was free to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The circuitous, world famous journey ofthe microfilm that contained his score which literally traveled around the globe to get to the US for its Americanpremiere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't dumbed down history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, more traditional doorstops about history might now seem cloggedup, overstuffed as they are with unnecessary dates and detail when Anderson -- with a vivid image and pointed line --can make his case with directness and verve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It leaves you with one exciting question: what will Anderson do next? --Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayThe storytelling is captivating, describing how Shostakovich began composing the symphony under relentlessbombardment in Leningrad and later finished it in Moscow, its triumphant performance in Leningrad during the siege,and how it rallied worldwide sympathy for Russia's plight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Music is at the heart of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Anderson writes in theprologue, "it is a story about the power of music and its meanings," and he communicates them with seemingeffortlessness in this brilliantly written, impeccably researched tour de force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A triumphant story of bravery anddefiance that will shock and inspire.—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)In a gripping narrative, helped along by ample photos and shockingly accurate historical details, Anderson offersreaders a captivating account of a genius composer and the brutally stormy period in which he lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though easily</p>
