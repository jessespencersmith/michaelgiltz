                <p>Saturday, February 16, 2019  NON-FICTION Can You Dig It? ‘Underground: A Human History Of The Worlds Beneath Our Feet’  February 5, 2019 Michael Giltz When author Will Hunt was a kid, a teacher told his class about an abandoned tunnel beneath the surface of their small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, Hunt and some friends tracked down the entrance and whooped their way throughan awesome sight: a huge tunnel, practically an invisible empire lying underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps unnaturally, Huntbecame obsessed with that tunnel, exploring it again and again and then realizing with a jolt it ran right belowthe very house he lived in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was that, until Hunt moved to New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the streets of Manhattan, Hunt was lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He found the subway confusing but was bewildered and overwhelmed, too embarrassed to ever ask for directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet he realized that an underground city, a maze of tunnels and pathways that were semi-abandoned and sort of illegal, lay just beneath, there for theexploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He ventured timidly intoone such tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just slippedthrough a fence near the West SideHighway, and suddenly he was belowthe surface of the city! And then heventured, not so timidly, into subwaytunnels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before he knew it, Hunt’s childhood passion became a lifelong obsession.Part travelogue and part meditation onthe nature of our connection to caves,Underground provides a fascinating, intriguing look at the bizarre,dangerous and thrilling subterraneanadventures Hunt has taken part in allover the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s been lost in thecatacombs underneath Paris and goneon a songline in Australia to win favorwith aboriginal tribes guarding afabled buried location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s partneredwith scientists and local experts toplumb Mayan ruins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunt wooed anaristocratic French family whose estate sits on an undisturbedunderground system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deep inside, inthe most inaccessible spot, he finds a sculpture of bison that leaves him and other visitors weeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On and on it goes, with Hunt traipsing all over the globe and showing how virtually every culture has a deep and powerful connection to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From obsessive diggers in England to a subway graffiti artist who placeshis visual diaries in locations where literally no one can safely glimpse them, Hunt makes fascinatingconnections again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, it seems perfectly natural for him to squeeze between girders assubway trains rumble past or spend a day huddled in absolute darkness in a cave where jaguars may or may notshow up at any minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s fun, a little frightening and awfully intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunt might just make you peer downthe nearest manhole and wonder what would happen if you pulled it open and slipped down inside…just for aglimpse.
