And then heventured, not so timidly, into subwaytunnels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before he knew it, Hunt‚Äôs childhood passion became a lifelong obsession.Part travelogue and part meditation onthe nature of our connection to caves,Underground provides a fascinating, intriguing look at the bizarre,dangerous and thrilling subterraneanadventures Hunt has taken part in allover the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He‚Äôs been lost in thecatacombs underneath Paris and goneon a songline in Australia to win favorwith aboriginal tribes guarding afabled buried location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He‚Äôs partneredwith scientists and local experts toplumb Mayan ruins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunt wooed anaristocratic French family whose estate sits on an undisturbedunderground system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deep inside, inthe most inaccessible spot, he finds a sculpture of bison that leaves him and other visitors weeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On and on it goes, with Hunt traipsing all over the globe and showing how virtually every culture has a deep and powerful connection to the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From obsessive diggers in England to a subway graffiti artist who placeshis visual diaries in locations where literally no one can safely glimpse them, Hunt makes fascinatingconnections again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, it seems perfectly natural for him to squeeze between girders assubway trains rumble past or spend a day huddled in absolute darkness in a cave where jaguars may or may notshow up at any minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs fun, a little frightening and awfully intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunt might just make you peer downthe nearest manhole and wonder what would happen if you pulled it open and slipped down inside‚Ä¶just for aglimpse.
