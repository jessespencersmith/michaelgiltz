"IJ it was something I liked, I'll take one over none," laughs Livingston, who is single md doesn't mind the off and on nature ofthe business, because he says he enjoys being lzy as much as working Fortunately, he didn't have to find out what it was like to be associated with just one movie: 1999's "Oftice Space" is a cult comedy of such enduring popularity that Livingston's Buddha-like approach to getting ahead in business without real- ly trying can be quoted at length by offrce" drones all over the country.And before that role could tJT)ecast him foreve4, he had his stint on "Sex and the City," not to mention a string of acclaimed roles in other projects, most notably his tum as an alcoholic in the Tom Hanks/ Steven Spielberg World War II miniseries "Band of Brothers," one of the most popu- lil HBO programs eYer .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throw in the prematurely canceled sit- com "Towies" (with MoUy Ringrilald and then-unknoms Jenna Elfman and Lauren Graham), his flashy tum as lawyer Alan Lowe in a multi-episode arc on "The Prac- tice," an Off Broadway stint in Neil LaB- ute's "In a Dark Dark House," and two separate weaselly executives in "The Cool- er" and "Adaptation," and clearly, Liyings- ton hasn't had much chance to laze about He hopes his two new films will actively get audiences into theaters "Music with- in' depicts the life of Richud Pimentel. who was the primary force behind the pas- sage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, a civil-rights landmark that opened the door (md built the ramps) for people living with physical handicaps And "Holly" shows the Menclr- ingly diffidt problem of sex traf- frcking md child prostitution, via the story of a washed-up guy in Cambodia who be- comes obsessed with trying to rescue a 14-year-old girl trapped in abrothel (Itwas filmed on Iocation in dan- gerous areas often controlled by criminals ) Neither fllm sw pulls its punches, but Livingston can see a sliver of light at the end of "HolJy'' despite its lack of heartwamirg TV-movie-style resolution. "A guy who was looking for a chance to redeem himself, redeemed himself," says Livingston "And a girl who had no choic- es finally had some choices- We wanted the audience to feel that the story is not done yet, and it's time for the audience to get involved if they want the story to have a happy ending " tN 'S1 iiEo B a N o=Uz = r @ N o a 6o 6o= @</p>
