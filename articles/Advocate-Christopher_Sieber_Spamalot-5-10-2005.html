                <p>arts&amp;eatertaiDmeat T II B 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; II a Out Broadway hunk· Christopher Sieber is enjoying his biggest hit yet By Michael Giltz Christopher Sieber has been in hit musicals like Thoroughly Modern Millie and Beauty and the Beast (where he had a blast playing the manly Gaston and met his partner of five years, actor Kevin Burrows).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also had the joy of a nightly showstopper, like his hilari­ ous number "Agony" in the critically ac­ claimed revival of Into the Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He even sang the occasional tune in his role as one of TV's first gay dads on ABC's sitcom It's AU Relative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing compares to the head­ spirullng (and limb-chopping) experi­ ence of being in the megasmash Monty Python's Spamalot, which is packing them in with the lure of Python routines and a top-notch cast that also includes Tim Curry, David Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria, and rising star Sara Ramirez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sieber talked with The Advocate about what it's like to go from being an "ugly kid with no neck" to playing a dashing knight in the biggest hit in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's cut to the chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can you get me tickets? [Laughs) This is my sweet revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growing up in the Midwest as a gay kid, you're picked 011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This girl was in my seventh-grad e French class, and she would poke her pencils in the back of my neck and then put her lip­ stick in my hair, and then she'd spray me with perfume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last weekend, who do I hear from but Amy from the seventh grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she asked for tick­ ets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I e-mailed her back, "Amy, there is no possible way I would get you tickets after the way you treated me." She hasn't re­ sponded yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You really work your butt off in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My partner, Kevin, goes on­ line and people write, "Christo­ pher is wasted in this show because he's in the first act and then you don't see him until the fi­ nale." They don't read the Playbill! I play Sir Galahad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in the second act I play the Black Knight, who has all his limbs chopped off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the most uncomfortable costume because of the special effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first cou­ ple of weeks, I had bruises all over my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anything for a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then I play Prince Herbert's fa­ ther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't really have a name; I'll call him Josh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a big, disgust­ ing man, so that's about 45 pounds of costume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone mentions your Andrew Lloyd Webber parody duet, '4Jhe Song That Goes Like This," with Sara Ramirez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's very rare that you get to work with someone and see them become one of THE ADVOCATE 16G I MAY 10, 2005 the biggest stars on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sara's on the verge of becoming something bigger than she can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've been in acclaimed musicals and performed great numbers that brought down the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is Spam­ alof really different? The day after we opened, coming to work and seeing the line go down the block-I've never been in a hit like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People talk about the roar of the crowd, and I thought I knew what they meant, but I'd never heard it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the curtain call, they're simply roaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a rock concert .• Giltz is a regular contributor to several periodicals, including the New York Post.</p>
