The better brands "upscale" the regular DVDs you already own, making them look better than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, they don't look as good as actual BluRay titles, but it does make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, youshould only be buying BluRay titles from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference is that significant, just like it waswhen you jumped from VHS to DVD or cassette to compact disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Replacing the DVDs you already own with BluRay -- Any title you truly love and want to watch over and over again is worth buying on BluRay no matter how much more expensive it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in general, I'd say unless a movie is absolutely one of your big favorites, there's no need toreplace all your regular DVDs with BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can watch all those movies and if you have an HD-ready TV, the BluRay player will make them look even better than they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And naturally, comediesand documentaries and TV shows (especially older ones) don't necessarily need the pizazz ofBluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, if we're talking a sci-fi spectacle like 2001: A Space Odyssey or a landmark film Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Dont encourage them to thinkthat BluRay can be an excuse to permanently raise prices on DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again, don't waste your money on regular DVDs any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it's an obscure flick that's never been available on DVD and isn't put out on BluRay, sure, make an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, hold off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So buy a BluRay player and start building your BluRay library, even if you don't own an HD-ready plasma or LCD TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you do, the format war is over, so what are you waiting for? Here are some recent BluRay releases and whether they make sense to buy compared to the cost of a regularDVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dark Knight ($35.99 on BluRay versus $34.98 for regular DVD special edition; Warner Bros.) Sure, you can buy a single disc regular DVD edition for $28.98 but I'm going to compare thestandard DVDs loaded with extras to the BluRay since if you're enough of a fan to buy the movie,you probably want all the bells and whistles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So in this case, there is only $1 in difference in thecost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And this movie looks stunning on BluRay -- a real demo disc for when your friends comeover, whether you're showing off your new TV or your sound system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, when there's no pricedifference, you'd be foolish to buy a regular DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is exactly why you need to buy a BluRayplayer now, whatever home entertainment system you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can enjoy the movie right awayand then be wowed once you upgrade your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tommy Boy ($29.99 on BluRay versus $12.98 for regular DVD; Paramount) -- Okay, an extra 17 dollars is a huge premium, especially when you're talking about a low-budget comedy that won't gain a huge benefit from being seen on BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you own it already, I don't see the need toupgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, if it's on your all-time favorite list, any movie is worth getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Cheetah Girls One World ($34.99 versus $29.99 on regular DVD; Disney) -- Okay, the price difference is a minimal $5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, there's no need for super great picture or sound on the titles your kids watch, is there? Maybe not, but why buy a regular DVD when BluRayis available and has a few extra bonus features they'll love to check out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the price is about thesame, you should go BluRay, even for kids' stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Man Who Fell To Earth ($39.95 versus $39.95 for regular DVD; Criterion) -- Criterion always sets the gold standard for special edition DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here we have one of their first BluRay releases, only to discover that it costs exactly the same amount as their regular Criterion release.One big difference: the regular Criterion edition came with a copy of the book the movie is basedon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise the editions are identical and I imagine the extras will be identical when possible aswell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the movie matters to me more than the extras, I'm especially glad the price is the same.This BluRay also comes in a flimsier cardboard slipcover, which is either another cost-saving "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So wait until the price comes down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you're itching to own it and wonder whether you should pay $20 for a regular DVD? In general, just go cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the price is too high to buy on BluRay, don't buy it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the only way to let the studios know that you're not willing to pay a premium for the pleasure of buying movies on BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They should see BluRay as a reason to keep you buying titles, not as an excuse to raise prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, DVDs were better and cheaper than VHS and that market took off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDs were almost always more expensive than cassettes and for a while it worked but when a cheaper alternative came along (digital tracks) the market collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lower BluRay prices and be glad people aren't just watching these movies for free online! Into The Wild ($29.99 versus $35.98 for the special edition regular DVD; Paramount) -- Here's a terrific surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BluRay edition is $6 LESS than the regular DVD special edition and contains all the same bonus features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the same price as the regular single disc DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an acclaimedfilm that's beautfully shot and looks great on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just on principal, we should all buy this title toencourage them into pricing BluRays like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lost Complete Fourth Season ($96.99 versus $59.99 for regular DVD; ABC/Disney) -- And here's the exact opposite of Into The Wild, a DVD set that is dramatically more expensive than the regular DVD for absolutely no good reason. (A few modest exclusive extras certainly aren't worth $36.) On top of it, both sets are the same price as previous season sets despite having fewerepisodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, the series looks even more smashing on BluRay than regular DVD -- this is Lost , and not some set-bound sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this massive price hike is unconscionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watch the episodesonline and wait for a much lower price point before adding it to your library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if the show's a favorite, the gap in prices make this one you should resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATE: the Suggested Retail Price for this set was lowered soon after it came out to $69.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's only $10 more than the $59.99 for the regular DVDs and since this is an entire season as opposed to just one movie, that's a very competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it was a dumb move to put it out even for a week at such a higher SRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People see that in their heads and get the fixed idea that BluRay will be much more expensive than regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course what YOU should be looking at are the sale prices and when it comes to that, BluRay is quickly matching regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See my update below for more info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And thanks to Jeff Kleist of The Digital Bits for alerting me to this price change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ray Charles Live at Montreaux 1997 ($24.98 versus $14.98 on regular DVD; Eagle Rock) -- Okay, Ray Charles is a giant but this show comes at the tail end of his illustrious career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a fine concert, if not a legendary one for such a riveting, iconic figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten dollars more is a big increasefor the BluRay version, especially since it's a low-cost price point to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm generallyavoiding comparing sale prices, but in this case I'd point out that buying it on sale reduces thedifference to just over $5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, no need to encourage smaller companies to hike their prices justlike the big ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They should provide better value and gain market share on the big boys that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ghost ($29.99 versus $12.99 on regular DVD; Paramount) -- Maybe this is your favorite romantic movie and you won't mind ponying up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again, there's no reason a movie almost 20 years old should cost more than twice as much on BluRay as it does on regular DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Death Race ($39.98 versus $29.98 on regular DVD; Universal) -- This is an action flick and so it'll pop on BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you're a Jason Statham fan, at least you can tell yourself the extra money is worth the free digital copy the BluRay version offers so you can watch it on yourcomputer or portable device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, a 30% increase in price is hard to justify in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Cars War Wire Video Financial Crisis Barack Obama MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

No way, unless female stunt artists are a source of joy for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Old School ($29.99 versus $14.99 for regular DVD; DreamWorks) -- A very funny comedy that isn't going to really improve dramatically on BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And twice the price keeps this off your list unless Vince Vaughn is unmissable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In that case you probably own it already on regular DVD andthere's no need to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other recent BluRay releases: The Truman Show ($29.99; Paramount); Event Horizon ($29.99; Paramount); The Women (2008 remake) ($35.99; New Line); Tori Amos Live at Montreaux ($24.98; Eagle Rock); Days Of Thunder ($29.99; Paramount); The Heartbreak Kid ($29.99; DreamWorks); The Strat Pack Live In Concert ($24.98; Eagle Rock); Last Holiday ($29.99; Paramount); and Coach Carter ($29.99; Paramount).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there you see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On new releases, sometimes you can pay even less for BuRay and often it'swithin $5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it's a big spectacle, that makes BluRay well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On reissues of classic movies, the bigger the flick and the more special effects, the more likely it's worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And whether it's a comedy, a TV show or a classic western, unless the title is among your absolute favorite, there's no need to shell out 30% or even 100% more just for the pleasure of BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But do buy a player today, slow down or stop your regular DVD purchases, buy new releases when they make financial sense and carefully upgrade your catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BluRay is a major leap ahead and you shouldn't spendany more money on regular DVDs if you can help it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE Okay, so tons of comments on this post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I first put it up on Friday and today the New York Times has an article talking about BluRay's fuzzy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're right and wrong -- I don't expect it tosupplant regular DVD completely or even wholly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with DVD sales slowing (it's a matureformat), if they can keep sales steady by introducing improvements like BluRay then that'll be asuccess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the NYT is wrong in thinking of BluRay as a whole new format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can buy avery modestly priced BluRay player today ($150 and dropping) and watch all your regular DVDs onit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't need to get rid of them and buy BluRay the way you did when you switched from VHSto DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some responses to the most frequent comments. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW DARE YOU! THERE'S A RECESSION -- Yes, we're in a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But people will still review new automobiles and fancy restaurants and vacation getaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone will buy a new car this year, even if most people will hold off if they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People like to read reviews of wildly expensive restaurants even if they never plan to eat there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And DVDs are hardly a luxury item a la yachts and caviar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're a family of four, a $22 DVD is a great bargain compared to going to the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the Depression of the 1930s, people went to movies more often than they ever have before or since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But did the fact of the Depression mean movie critics at the time were insensitive cretins for even talking about films? Of course not. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW FORMAT X IS JUST ON THE HORIZON -- A new format or technology is ALWAYS on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you follow that logic, you must be watching a 12 inch black and white TV while listening to your Edison cylindars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am VERY cautious about embracing a new format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've activelycampaigned against almost every new format in entertainment you can think of, from VHS andlaser disc (too expensive and bulky) to Divx and MP3s. (Hate 'em.) The ONLY two formats I'veembraced in the last 25 years are CDs and DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And whatever new formats arise in years tocome, I'll enjoy the library of CDs and DVDs I have now for the rest of my life, just like somepeople still enjoy their LPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New technologies don't mean old technologies become "useless." I'llstill enjoy my hardcover book even if you only read on a Kindle. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HI-DEF DOWNLOADING IS CLEARLY GONNA STOMP ON DVDS -- I do agree that streaming and downloading movies will be the dominant way people rent movies quite soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for many technological and legal reasons, hi-def downloading is years away from being thedominant way to buy movies, even if we do overcome efforts by telecos/cable/internet companiesto charge people onerous fees for using a lot of bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And certainly, worldwide, hi-defdownloading is absurd to consider as dominating in giant markets like China, India, Indonesia andAfrica for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the US won't be capable of getting it available to a majority ofusers for a good decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so what if it does become dominant and you decide come 2015 thatyou never want to buy a DVD again? The library you have will still be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you only rent,the modest $150 you spent to get a BluRay player so you could rent BluRay from Netflix (for anMichael Giltz: DVDs -- How And Why You Should Switch To BluRay http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----how-and-why-you-s_b_154840.html [4/5/2009 12:47:06 PM] Michelle Obama's Clothing Has Sean Hannity All Out OfSorts Richard Poplawski, Gunman'Lying In Wait,' Kills 3Pittsburgh Police Officers Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rachel Ehrenfeld: DoesIran Harbor Osama binLaden?

To have this option available toyou, you'll have to shell out a modest $150 for a DVD player that plays regular and Bluray DVDs.But hey, even if you're just renting from Netflix, a BluRay player makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the worst casescenario happens and the studios abandon BluRay in five years, you'll STILL be able to watch andbuy regular DVDs using your player and enjoy the superior quality of BluRay for the titles they didrelease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I'll bet anyone any amount they want to suggest that DVDs in both or either formatwill absolutely be around in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To suggest they'll disappear completely is silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And AGAIN, ifthey did, so what? You can still enjoy the library you've built for the rest of your life, just like yourbooks and CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Samsung DVD-F1080 HDMI Samsung Region Free DVD Player HDMI 1080p DVD Players on Sale! www.World-Import.com Michael Giltz: DVDs -- How And Why You Should Switch To BluRay http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----how-and-why-you-s_b_154840.html [4/5/2009 12:47:06 PM]Comments 191 Pending Comments 0 Want to reply to a comment?

If you have the proper LCD/Plasma screen, a Blu-ray player, proper cables and a decentsound system then you will get the full experience it has to offer which is 100 times better then regulartv in my mind! And to those who say it's not the right time...well, it doesn't cost much to get started on Blu ray. $300 for a decent sound system, $500 for a decent screen, $160 for a Blu ray player and $20 for cables and Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:38 PM on 01/05/2009 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:11 PM on 01/05/2009 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:52 PM on 01/05/2009 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:10 PM on 01/05/2009Michael Giltz: DVDs -- How And Why You Should Switch To BluRay http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----how-and-why-you-s_b_154840.html [4/5/2009 12:47:06 PM] your on the way to ultimate entertainment for under $1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what do people do during a bad economy?? Statistics say that people do more tv watching...well I say, if your gonna spend all that time glued in front of the tv, why not make it worth while by switchingto high defintion??? Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Great point about cocooning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, if people already own the home entertainment system,there's absolutely no downside to getting an inexpensive BluRay player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Modest investmenton top of what they've already spent and when the BluRay movie is about the same price asthe regular one, why wouldn't you choose that version? And even if you're not ready toupgrade to an HD-ready plasma or LCD screen (maybe it'll be years away), you can buy the titles on BluRay and watch them right away on your regular TV screen if you buy a cheap player, along with your regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then when you switch over to a better TV screen, you'll have a ready supply of 10 or 20 or however many BluRay titles that will look so much better they'll seem like new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thx for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elandyll See Profile I'm a Fan of Elandyll permalink Yeah, $200 for a new technology that's 2 years in -is- cheap, wether the cheapskates like it or not.The DVD tech was quite a bit more expensive relatively back in 2001btw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, is it more expensive to buy in Blu Ray or get your weekly carton of cigarettes? Or your Booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually I'm pretty sure it's also cheaper than the weekly Baseball game where you stuff your face with chili dogs or greasy bbq ribs + beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's better for your health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Online is going to take over anyway? On which planet do you live? Because last time I checked, Bandwith isn't free, and it's going to get pricier with the more people sucking on it, and the quality of video on it is sub par at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not counting all the areas in the world (in the US even) not covered by Broadband.Entertainment is vain and worhtless? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not like life has to be lived for anything other thanworking your butt off and reproducing, right? I agree that the price of the BR movies need to go down, but any film lover has, is considering, or will soon, change to Blu Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference is that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus it's compatible with my DVD collection.Btw I come from a middle class income home, both my wife and I work our butts off, but we lovemovies.Last year: HDTV - $1100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PS3: $399.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year: 2nd BR player (bedroom) - $180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thx for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll also be stuffing my face with a hot dog at a Yankee game when I'm nothome watching BluRay, recession or no recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JeanPaulSatire See Profile I'm a Fan of JeanPaulSatire permalink Evidently it has escaped Glitz's notice that we're in a recession (and have been for a year); people arelosing their jobs, their homes, and retirement savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing else could explain Giltz calling a $200 BluRay DVD player "very cheap" -- especially when he clearly intends that it will be a DUPLICATE piece of electronics (albeit an upgrade).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thx for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For electronics, under $300 is often considered the price point where aproduct goes mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end of the year, BluRay players will be available for $99(you can already get them for $150).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People already paying for Netflix can rent BluRayinstead of regular DVDs for just $1 more and get a lot more bang for their buck -- and on abudget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, my column is about buying and renting DVDs which may seem like aluxury to those out of work but should I just stop writing about DVDs? Should people stoptalking about movies and books and music because some people will choose not to buy themat this time?

You mean an HD capable TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a flat screen Toshiba CRT TV that is about five years old, and it definitely does not support HD despite the shape ofits screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bought a blu ray player for Christmas only because my old DVD player stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a 32 inch LCD TV that supports 1080i and 720p but not 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The blu ray on 720p looks marginally better than a standard dvd with upconversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference would probably be more noticeable on a bigger screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scene in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford with the night riders hiding in the woods with hoods over their heads being illuminated by the light of the passing trainlooked really spooky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Probably better than it would have looked on an upconverted dvd, but I am notconvinced it would have been worth it if my old dvd player hadn't died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least I should thank you for not using that ad writer's blather about 1080p being "full HD," as though any other output is somehow not really HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are no HD tv signals out there that are 1080p andanyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between 1080p and 1080i or 720p on any but the biggest screen is full of baloney. 1080p is not "full" it is just highest resolution with progressive scan CURRENTLY available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for the info -- I'm no tech expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've changed the wording. goodgravy See Profile I'm a Fan of goodgravy permalink we watched our first blueray DVD movie last night. loved the quality of the pic. pastgone See Profile I'm a Fan of pastgone permalink DVD's look just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And because they are digital, they'll never be truly obselete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worrying about constanly upgrading your technology to the latest is just another example of American consumerismrunning rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hold on to what you've got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GeorgeKaplan See Profile I'm a Fan of GeorgeKaplan permalink "DVD's look just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And because they are digital, they'll never be truly obsolete."

How's this for an idea: be happy with whatyou've got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Hi PaxMundis, You could of course write that comment after every single article in everysingle newspaper and magazine and website published for the next ten years that doesn'tdirectly address the economy and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's your point? No one should watchany TV, ready any books, watch any movies, or buy anything because f these important pressing issues? My article was not about grotesque over-indulgence (I was hardly writing about skiing trips via helicopter to remote mountains or the like).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's about how people likeme on a budget and wary of new techology formats might for various reasons find it economically reasonable if they buy DVDs already to buy BliuRay since more and more of them are about the same price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not being rich but loving music, for example, I stopped buyingcassettes and had a "library" of about 30 CDs before I bought my first CD player, which only happened after prices came down enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can enjoy good films (like Al Gores An Inconvenient Truth or Iranian cinema or Ballast, the story of ignored and forgotten people inmiddle America) AND also stay engaged in those important issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why can't you? Northreader See Profile I'm a Fan of Northreader permalink Michael Glitz might find of interest a Nov. 6, 2008 article in Maclean's, the Canadian weeklynewsmagazine (macleans.ca) by Jason Kirby with the tag "New Blu-Ray format 'in a death spiral 'andthe sub-head "VHS reigned for 30 years, but Blu-ray is faltering after eight months." I know the bigsales campaign is on now and even Blockbuster is selling Sony Blu-Ray players as part of it .I enjoythe Jeffrey Wells blog "Hollywood Elsewhere" and he is in love with Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm sorry,--as one ofthe peasants who is happy with normal DVDs, it is hard to climb on the hypemobile with Glitz, Wells and company.I love my DVDs and life is too short to happily march into yet another format now that Sony and its friends have banished Toshiba's rival format and we're all expected to salute and pay the price.I went to buy "Mama Mia" as a Christmas present on DVD and noticed the much higher price for Blu-Ray at a Canadian chain (Future Shop) now owned by Best Buy.They almost seemed to besuddenly trying to hide the regular DVDs. ianmcc See Profile I'm a Fan of ianmcc permalink Unfortunately it's the exact same process that was used when DVD replaced VHS, thecommercials are EXACTLY the same! The commercials progressed from, "Available in VHSand now DVD/Available in VHS and DVD/Available in DVD and VHS." It's currently exactlythe same with DVD and the Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The video companies DON'T CARE if Blu-Ray isn'tselling as well as it should right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've decided that the Blu-Ray will be what peoplewill have to buy PERIOD, so they can make more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the same thing with TV's, I'veheard that soon non-flatscreen TV's will not be sold ANYWHERE in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a known factthat flatscreens are constructed to burn out FASTER than regular TV's but cost over 3 1/2times the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guess what Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giltz and the video and tv companies??

How often do people really watch Batman on DVD, or BluRay anyway? 10 times a month? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just watch it On Demand, through your cable subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's so much greener than buying all new BluRays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a colossal waste, replacing everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Netflix, under certain plans, lets you watch movies on your computer! Hook up your computer to your TV, and you're good to go! gitrdone See Profile I'm a Fan of gitrdone permalink Streaming pay per view movies to your tv is the same as renting movies....you don't actuallyown the movie yet!
