He's boorish, egotistical,pushy, physically aggressive, married, insulting and tiresomely boastful about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might say he's not one-tenth as charming as he thinks, but that would imply he actually thinks rather than merely actson instinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the woman (Halley Feiffer)!! She's dithering, sad,painfully unconfident, incapable of speaking up for herself longer than a second or two and just...pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You want to empathize with her of course, but that's trumped (yes, trumped) by your desire to shake herand say, "Get a hold of yourself!" Naturally, you start to ask yourself questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are these two grotesque caricatures of these types? Should we be laughing at them? Will those grow more and more absurd? Will the blunt obviousness of the scenebe amped up or toned down into something real? What the heck arewe supposed to think about all this? Those are the sort of questionsyou ask yourself when absolutely nothing is going right in a show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thetwo characters aren't funny or real or satirical enough to hold our attention in the least and the date goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slowly, the play reveals itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overlong first scene is their date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dull second scene takes place four years later, with the woman still having an affair with this married man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final scene is a confrontation of sorts between the mistress and the wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, witha groan you realize the three scenes all take place on Presidentialelection nights: 2012, 2016 and 2020.

With the play failing to create a single interesting character, its attempt to hijack politics for a stab at significance lessens what was already a very poor affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When nothing is going right, it's hard for anyone to do good work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thethree settings (Japanese restaurant, bedroom and living room) all blurtogether visually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actors do what they can, with Linklater trying to inject some energy into a paper-thin conceit and Feiffer the actress surely wanting to have a talk with Feiffer the writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without spoiling the entire plot, it's hard to describe just how perplexing the entire work proves from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When no one is believable, nothing makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second scene, the two characters veer back and forth randomly from playful to bitter totender, never at the same moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing tops our astonishmentthat they have been dating on the sly for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four years? Nothing in the first scene would make you believe they would remain together for four hours, much less four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since the womanhas been tragically stumped by a debilitating chronic illness, the ideathat this man in particular would waste any time on her goes againsteverything we ever know about him, Even that pales in comparison to the bewildering final scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bewilderment and perplexity, I hasten to add, are not the same asinterest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You never wonder what the characters are thinking; youspend the entire evening wondering what the hell the playwright was thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2▼ April (10) THEATER: "INK" STAINED WRETCHES GET THEIR DUE THEATER: "TOOTSIE" IS A DRAG THEATER: "ALL MY SONS" LACKS A FAMILY THEATER: 'HADESTOWN" FINDS HEAVEN ON BROADWAY THEATER: "BURN THIS" BARELY SMOLDERS THEATER: THE PAIN OF "THE PAIN OF MYBELLIGERENCE"...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: QUESTIONING "SOCRATES" THEATER: "OKLAHOMA!"
