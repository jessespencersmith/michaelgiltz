He added: "I just hope and pray thedecision that was made was made on the basis of sound judgment,and made for the right reasons, and not made because it wasnecessary to save the president's job."Is this a Democrat daring to question Bush's honesty in the war onterror? Nope, it's Daniel R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coats, then Republican senator fromIndiana and now the ambassador to Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was attackingClinton and suggesting missile attacks against Al Quaeda were simplymotivated by a desire to make us all forget about Clinton's personalindiscretions.Just in case you thought it was unprecedented for someone toquestion the motives of the President :) Glad To Be Laid OffI Got Laid Off And Now I Make $5k A Month With Only A$2 Investment.www.DavidsOnlineBusiness.comHow I Lost 43 Pounds in 12 Weeks!Find out how to lose that fat belly in no time with this CrazyDiet!LaurasBody.comMy Wrinkles Melted AwayLearn How a Mom Combined 2 Products to Get Rid of HerWrinkles ForeverHowtoFixYourWrinkles.com Get listed here Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser Logout from DisqusLogged in asusing Facebook Connect (Logout)Type your comment here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unclaimed Register withDISQUSWhy?Use Media ▼Community Page Comments feed Trackbacks Daily KosBeck: Daily Kos, C&amp;L blame me for cop killer -Because it’s all about him, right?
