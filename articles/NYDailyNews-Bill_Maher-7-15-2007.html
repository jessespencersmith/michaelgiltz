"I even love playing the red states," says Mahe4 whose newest HBO standup spe- cial, "The Decider," airs live from Bos- ton on Saturday. "San Francisco doesn't need me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when I play St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Louis or Salt Lake City, those people are really happy that somebody with my views has come to their town." Aperennial bachelor (and proud some- time guest at the Playboy Mansion), Ma- het 51, born in NewYork and raised in NewJersey, knows what it's like to be un- welcome: In 2001, he lost his ABC show "Politically Incorrect" after echoing point- ed rqmarks made by one of his conserva- tive guests about the 9/l I hijackers.' "There was a time when I was afraid to go out of the house," says Maher, who was singled out during White House press conferences when single-minded patrio-tism uninterested in hearing dissent was perhaps at its peak. "I thought people would just slug me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's quite a feeling to be America's No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hated object." But now Maher enjoys the acclaim of his one-hour talk-and-panel show Friday nights at 11 p.m. that draws in top politi- cians and thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the country he says, is much more in sync with him. "We're stuckwith fPresident Bush] for the next year and a half," says Maher, who initially supported the invasion of lraq. "What I'm sensing out there is frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was acceptance ofhim and thdn there was hope ...There was a time when being against Bush was sort of un-Ameri- can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those davs have ended." rally Maher is going out on another limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His next project - and perhaps theSo, with everything going his way, natu- : thought, 'This is going to be funny."', comedy bits and archival film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the ; : Cannes Film Festival this past May, the , : film sold in l8 countries immediately and : , sparkedabiddingwarintheU.S.-even, though every one ofthose buyers has up , to now remained anonymous. . , "No subject is [as incendiary] as reli- : gion," says Maher.
