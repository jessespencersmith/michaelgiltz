(The main image I took away was Cohen stepping back every once in a while bemused by the circus around him.) And it captures the oh so earnest tenor of the times beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen invites fans to swarm towards thestage and then chastises security for freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later, he thanks the "friend" who convinced him tosign away publishing rights to "Suzanne" because -- Cohen insists -- it wouldn't be right to make money off a song like that, a song that was such a gift and a privilege to compose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palmer is one of the great documentary filmmakers when it composes to music and opera, such as his landmark story of popularmusic, All You Need Is Love from the Seventies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's another gem to his credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go here to see the DVDs Palmer has available from his catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SONGS FROM THE ROAD ($24.98 BluRay or $17.98 CD/DVD; Sony Legacy) -- Oh how times have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen has grown from thanking someone for pushing him into a bad publishing deal to havingto push himself out onto the road to make some money after another so-called friend bilked him out of funds and left Cohen broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But out of this sad circumstance came a heartening world tour in whichCohen played and sang with more assurance to more fans than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This concert picks and chooses the best performances (12 in all) from the entire tour, so a song from 2008 at the O2 Arena in London is followed by another one year later in San Jose, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all flows smoothly because of arelative lack of unnecessary editing (by today's standards) and the eternal presence of Cohen and thatvoice and those lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the biggest change is how his public persona has evolved so gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A man who has spent so many decades showered with praise might understandably be even more solemn and serious and full of himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Cohen is revealed as puckish, self-deprecating and generous ofheart time and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a fine keepsake from probably the last tour of this magnitude he'll ever take. 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS camille grammer helen mirren poses nude miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss More Celebrity News at People.com Like 720 Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton JoinsFuture In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp;Vanessa Hudgens Back On? READ MORE Willliam and Kate's Love Story There's No Viral Video Like 'Home' LEONARD COHEN'S LONESOME HEROES ($19.95; Chrome Dreams) -- But I haven't mentioned the songs, really, have I? Let's leave that to the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lonesome Heroes is a dry academic sort of documentary that celebrates the music of Leonard Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singer Judy Collins and Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone are joined by biographers, critics, academics, and even a Buddhist monk to discuss theirlove of songs like "Hallelujah," "Chelsea Hotel," "Waiting For The Miracle" and what it all means and whyhe's important and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You do get some rare footage but it's strictly for the hardcore fan who simply has to have it all and does want nearly 2 hours devoted to parsing Cohen's lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Me, I'd rather spin Various Positions and practice my performance of "Famous Blue Raincoat" for my next karaoke outing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ONLY SON/THERE WAS A FATHER ($39.95; Criterion) -- I remember many years ago reading that in Japan, Akira Kurosawa was not as beloved as Westerners might imagine, that other more "Japanese" directors than Kurosawa were ranked higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assumed this was just sour grapes, the desire to take down a notch someone beloved by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A prophet in his own town, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who could be betterthan Kurosawa? Then I began seeing the films of Yasujiro Ozu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First came the late period masterpieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then early silent films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now I'm filling in the middle, such as these two heartbreakers -- one about a mother who gives up everything for her son (1936) and the other about a father so wrapped up in his sonhe ends up driving the kid away (1942).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Criterion presents them with its usual care, from the lovelypackaging with illustrations by Adrian Tomine to new video interviews with scholars and very informative liner notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another must-have from Criterion.TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift Kourtney K.'s StunningBikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES More Celebrity News at Popeater.com One And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,228 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,031 Comments PHOTOS: Raven- Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss 531 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 106 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 65 Comments Director: 'Ghostbusters 3' Is Happening 88 CommentsMichelle Williams onKeeping Heath's Memory AliveMYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 VOLUME XIX ($69.97; Shout) -- I pity the poor MST3K fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They may think they've got all the witty commentary on bad movies they could possibly need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isn't 18 volumes enough? But then Shout offers them a very cool Gypsy figurine, panel discussions from fanconventions, mini-posters and of course four bad movies with goofy jokes thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So yes, maybe youdon't have to own Robot Monster, Bride Of The Monster, Devil Doll and Devil Fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you will, won't you? Just make sure you take Gypsy to work so your significant other doesn't know you bought this one too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOOKING FOR ERIC ($24.98; IFC) -- You don't expect a heartfelt comic film fromKen Loach (whose Palme d'Or winner "The Wind That Shakes The Barley" was one of my favorites of the year and far moretypically serious).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know famed football/soccer player Eric Cantona from Adam. (Pele, I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronaldo, I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cantona? An Italian best known for his stellar work with Manchester United? Not aclue.) He's obviously an icon, first and foremost for his play of course but also for his elliptical sayings in interviews and press conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this film isn't about Cantona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's about Eric Bishop, an aging father of three kids (from, perhaps, two marriages and an affair -- that's a little murky) who realizes hepanicked and blew it with the only woman he ever loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His mates from the post office where he workshelp him out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And one, a self-help book enthusiast, begins the film with a hilarious scene where each man is asked to take on the persona of someone they admire and want to be like -- the middle aged men choose Frank Sinatra, Nelson Mandela and the like while Eric says immediately Eric Cantona and they allmurmur approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That plus a little pot smoking leads to the moment where Eric is sitting in his bedroom when the real Cantona suddenly appears to offer his manly, eccentric advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eric takes courage from Cantona's promptings and makes radical changes: getting rid of the surfeit of televisions in the house,doing a spot of exercise and trying not to panic when around his first and best wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now like most peoplein the US, Cantona means nothing to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The US equivalent would be Mickey Mantle or (to choose a living person) maybe Dennis Rodman or Roger Clemens before he was exposed as a cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you get it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie shows numerous beautiful, legendary goals that Cantona scored and it doesn'ttake long to buy into his natural charisma, wacky sayings (often lifted directly from quotes Cantona has made in the past, apparently) and inspirational powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a comic spin on Field of Dreams, with a lot more marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their scenes together are the heart of the film, which is also special because it combines such a typical feel-good comedy with the gritty realism Ken Loach is known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The finale may be a tad too feel good for what could have been a great film, but it remains great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It came and went in the US, perhaps because it was centered around a footballer we didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's a shame; idol Facebook Gabrielle Giffords Video NFL Gun Control iPad Haiti Earthquake Atheism Sarah Palin MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST worship and straight talk are universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FORBIDDEN PLANET ($24.98; Warner Bros.) ORLANDO ($19.94; Sony) THE EVIL DEAD ($29.97; Anchor Bay) -- Three gems in new editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forbidden Planet is the template for serious sci-fi, thanks to a plot lifted from Shakespeare and the smarts to not make that seem silly, even with Robby The Robot around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great extras include a second Robby The Robot film called TheInvisible Boy, an episode of the TV show The Thin Man called "Robot Client" (guess who appears), a good TCM documentary on sci-fi and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it looks great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Orlando, Tilda Swinton just seems like she's come from another planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in reality, she's just a gender-fluid heroine for a new age andSwinton is so deliciously good you just roll with this high concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Virginia Woolf's novel isn't as much fun and surely it seemed impossible to turn into a film anyway until Swinton came along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Modest extras include some commentary by director Sally Potter and while i have no earlier version to compare it looksfine but doesn't knock me out. (Perhaps that's why there's no BluRay.) The Evil Dead is a movie I haven'tpaid enough attention to since the classic Evil Dead 2 always beckons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a great gross-out original made with passion and pennies with new commentary from director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The limited edition bonus disc with all sorts of extras really was a limited edition and seems to be soldout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, you can find the single disc BluRay on sale for $10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEGENDS OF THE CANYON ($19.98; Image) -- An amiable excuse for photographer Henry Diltz to capture a lost era when Laurel Canyon in California seemed like the center of the rock universe, encompassing Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash; Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, the Mammas &amp; The Pappas, the Byrds and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The era is timeless and so is the music -- though most of it won't be heard here or only in briefsnatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basically, this is a ramshackle gathering of random footage interspersed with anecdotes, mostly centering around CSN, who are also present in front of the camera, along with Van Dyke Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strictly for hippies and those who can't get enough of that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director: Olivia Wilde Dons Andy Samberg, Natalie Portman: I TV ROUNDUP TV ROUNDUP TV ROUNDUP TV ROUNDUP TV ROUNDUP TV ROUNDUP 21 JUMP STREET: COMPLETE SERIES ($69.98; Mill Creek) AMERICA: THE STORY OF US ($49.95 BluRay and $39.95 regular; A&amp;E) MONARCHY THE COMPLETE SERIES ($79.99; Acorn) DEXTER FOURTH SEASON ($64.99 BluRay and $49.99 regular; Showtime/Paramount) COUGAR TOWN FIRST SEASON ($39.99; ABC) THE MIDDLE FIRST SEASON ($44.98; ABC) SONS OF ANARCHY SEASON TWO ($69.99 BluRay or $59.98 regular; FOX) THE OFFICE SEASON SIX ($69.98 BluRay or $59.98 regular; Universal) -- What better way to say goodbye to TV icon Stephen J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cannell than one of his most successful series? 21 Jump Street launched Johnny Depp and made crime safe for teenagers again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's at its most self-conscious best when tackling a "serious" issue in high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, if there were no serious issues, why would cops be undercover in the first place? The picture quality is minimal but the price is certainly right for all five seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America:The Story Of Us is a too simplistic look at our country's history, interrupted every five minutes by celebrities like Meryl Streep, Michael Douglas and Donald Trump because they're scared kids will getbored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In stark contrast is Monarchy , which takes an equally massive topic but with just serious intent and the right talking heads makes it fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dexter should have run out of steam long ago but apparently the life and loves of a serial killer is richer material than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cougar Town and The Middle are overshadowed by Emmy winner Modern Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But The Middle is consistent and Cougar Town has the best ensemble on a sitcom right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it's not catching on is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sons Of Anarchy is catching on and just renewed for a fourth season, so start catching up with this biker saga that should appeal to fans of The Shield .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I'd be pleased if I could say that the sixth season of The Office was its last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pam and Jim's wedding was the obvious finale and the show could have left with its head held high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead it's plugging along with at least one more season to go (number eight).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does not obligate him in any way to speak positively or negatively of their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...Comments 7 Pending Comments 0View FAQ 0 Fans 1 Fans 536 Fans 47 Fans 42 Fans 'Ghostbusters 3' Script Is ReadySee-Through Bikini (PHOTOS)Johnny Knoxville To Star In...Was 'Barely Eating' During...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Letsgetrea l, How wonderful that you were able to see Leonard perform in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leonard Cohen's World Tour comes to an end December 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tell him what his concerts have meant to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please sign the Thank You card that will be presented to Leonard on December 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Details at the SpeakingCohen website: http://www .webheight s.net/spea kingcohen/ card.html and until last year, I thought I was the only one that had never seen Leonard Cohen in concertbefore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Got the opportunit y last year and it was sublime, am eternally grateful to have had that experience .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was smooth, he was cool, and he still has the voice and the moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have worn out my Live in London CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once you've seen him, you want to see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope he comes back totour the USA one more time, at least!
