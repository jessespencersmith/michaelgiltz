                <p>F R I D AY, D E C E M B E R 0 1 , 2 0 0 6Neil Diamond Reteams With Producer Rick RubinThis is the best news of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neil Diamond is following up "12Songs" with a new collaboration with producer Rick Rubin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It might bea covers album, all originals, a mix of the two or who knows what.Clearly, though, they're in it for the long haul which is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diamondhas written a lot of great songs over the years but "12 Songs" was by farhis most satisfying work on a single album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Billboard item saysDiamond has just recovered from "depression" over the fiasco of thatalbum's release, which sounds like an exaggeration but probablywasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diamond had delivered the best album of his career, got greatreviews and then his label screwed it up by putting the CD out withidiotic copyright coding that was so intrusive into people's computersand so outrageous that the album had to be pulled from stores. (As ifmost of Diamond's presumably older fans are pirating CDs in the firstplace.) "12 Songs" is being reissued on Dec 12 with demos and the such,but that hardly seems necessary since the songs are pretty demo-y inthe first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anything to bring it more attention is fine by me.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 3:33 PM 2 C O M M E N T S :Anonymous said...12 Songs is a great album (still listening to it a year later) so the nextone should be interesting.I wonder what covers will Rick get Neil to do.Some NIN perhaps?11:55 AM Michael in New York said...:) Too obvious of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covers would be interesting since Diamondhas no history as a performer of other people's songs. (Perhaps ahardcore fan will contradict me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in general he's stuck to his ownmaterial and I can't think of any notable cover he's ever done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thenotable excpetion being his Christmas CDs of course.) But he has agreat swaggering voice -- like Tom Jones to a degree -- and it'll be reallyinteresting to hear him do other people's stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diamond doing Dylan,say? "Lay Lady lay" would be too easy -- maybe "Don't Think Twice, It'sNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Neil Diamond Reteams With Producer R...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/12/neil-diamond-reteams-... 1 of 37/28/09 2:44 AMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SMichael in New YorkBiboyAaron POPSURFING.COM: Neil Diamond Reteams With Producer R...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/12/neil-diamond-reteams-... 2 of 37/28/09 2:44 AMPOPSURFING.COM: Neil Diamond Reteams With Producer R...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/12/neil-diamond-reteams-... 3 of 37/28/09 2:44 AM</p>
