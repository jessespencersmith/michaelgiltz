On slavery, Seward was seen as almost viciously anti-slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The truth was that he was a committed abolitionist, but not a radical one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wife was far more unwavering and extremist though, to be clear,Seward even harbored runaway slaves at one point. (He especially despised the fugitive slave laws that forced northerners who objected morally to slavery to support it legally.) Seward saw slavery as doomed to fail and was willing to stop its spread and patiently wait out its dying, helped along perhaps with government aid to slave owners ready to be compensated for the loss of their "property." Nonetheless, Seward was seen as the national figurehead for abolition and was despised by the South as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, despite coming tantalizingly close, he lost the nomination to Lincoln primarily because his (relatively more moderate) views were so well known while the less prominent Lincoln hadn't been forced to stake out opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothing else, reading this book will make a laughingstock of the foolish idea that the Civil War wasn't about slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incident after incident tore the nation apart, from the forming of newterritories to the slaughter of innocents in raids to the admission of states to fugitive slave laws to warwith Mexico and on and on and on, all of them revolving perilously around the the issue of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entirepolitical parties were formed on the basis of supporting and opposing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seward would prove a consistentand moderating influence on Lincoln throughout the war, an irony utterly lost on the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seward's most important role took place after losing the nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He campaigned tirelessly for Lincoln and Stahr makes a convincing case that Seward's contributions were key to Lincoln winning theWhite House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once ensconced as Secretary of State, Seward grew from initially thinking he could "guide"Lincoln (i.e. have all the power with Lincoln as a figurehead, a rather grandiose absurdity) to admiringLincoln tremendously and aiding him immeasurably, down to careful parsing of major speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seward's signal achievement was what didn't happen: through his diligent efforts during crisis after crisis, he soberly and smartly worked to keep foreign powers out of the war and to never officially recognize theConfederate States o America as a sovereign country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that had happened -- if England or France inparticular had sided with the South -- the United States likely would never have triumphed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This perspective allows Stahr to train a fresh perspective on the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Seward's work wasn't done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He endured the frustrating tenure of Johnson, who invariably and frustratingly ignored most of Seward's moderating suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Seward did manage to expand the nation, primarily through the purchase of Alaska, an act dubbed "Seward's folly" much later (at the time, it was lauded in the press)and ultimately seen as a smart buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garrulous, charming, poorly dressed, prone to flattery, stooping to buy votes and political favor in the manner of the time but not notably corrupt in his dealings, Seward could be tiresomely pleased with himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as Stahr's biography so ably demonstrates, he had every reason to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wasn't just Lincoln's indispensable man; throughout his career Seward was an indispensable man to the nation, aswell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the trailer to Steven Spielberg's upcoming film Lincoln .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can glimpse actor David Strathairn portraying Seward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOOKS I'VE READ SO FAR IN 20121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Underneath by Kathi Appelt *** Another Day In Polls, Still Neck-And-Neck 'Grey's Anatomy' Sneak Peek: Cristina's New 'Sex Friend,' Jackson's Lady Troubles &amp; More WATCH: Vivica A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox SLAMS Stacey Dash's Romney Endorsement Allred Goes To Court Over Mitt Romney Divorce Testimony Former Navy Secretary Sides With Obama On Ships DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Chip Davis Halloween Is a Night Like No Other Tavis Smiley The Top 20 (Cause 10 Ainâ€™t Enough) Reasons (Excuses) Black Folk Will Give if Obama Loses MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Katy Perry Video San Francisco Around Town Sharks Marijuana House Of Buy a link here Sponsored Links New York Homeowners 62 + may qualify to receive Gov. cash for the equity in there home www.senioradvisorycenter.com Are You 62 + &amp; Homeowner?
