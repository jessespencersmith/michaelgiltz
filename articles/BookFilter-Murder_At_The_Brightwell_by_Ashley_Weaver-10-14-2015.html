Since the body is thatof Rupert, a man Gil openly loathed, suspicion falls on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amory is determined to clear the name of her one-timelove while trying to clear up exactly how she feels about him and her actual husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't help that Milo is soonunderfoot, proving despicably charming and eager to help in Amory's amateur sleuthing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all rather silly with aclassic finale where the killer holds our heroine at bay and patiently explains all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the setting is glamorous, thedialogue pretty sharp and the back and forth between Amory and Milo genuinely fun and far more suspenseful thanfiguring out whodunit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mystery needs to be sharpened in future episodes but the team of Amory and Milo is anappealing one. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“This debut novel by a librarian lays the foundation for a stylish series with Milo and Amory channeling Nick and NoraCharles.”—Booklist“Fans of plucky female amateur sleuths will welcome Amory Ames, the heroine of Weaver's pleasing debut set in1932 England... the affable Amory could carry a series.”—Publishers Weekly“A spunky heroine, a tense romance and red herrings galore make Weaver's debut a pleasant read for nostalgiabuffs who miss Agatha Christie.”—Kirkus Reviews“Lovers of Agatha Christie and Jacqueline Winspear will enjoy this elegant murder mystery set on holiday at theEnglish seaside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What starts out as a lark, intended to make Amory Ames’s misbehaving-but-oh-so-delicioushusband jealous, turns into a dangerous and deadly game of whodunit for Amory and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love, jealousy,and revenge are tangled together in this smart and sophisticated British mystery reminiscent of the genre’s goldenage.”—October 2014 LibraryReads List “Murder at the Brightwell is an elegant Christie-esque 1930s romp that will delight fans of Rhys Bowen's LadyGeorgie series with its wit, charm, and strong independent heroine.…More</p>
