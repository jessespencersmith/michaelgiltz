How did that happen?" Take 21, the card counting casino caper based on the true story of MIT students who figured out a way to win at blackjack. (It's not cheating as such, but casinos hate it when you can game the system to your advantage and fight it aggressively.) 21 ($28.96 for standard or $34.95 for a special edition and $38.96 for BluRay; Columbia) features a young good-looking cast of kids and KevinSpacey and Laurence Fishburne in key supporting roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie got mixed reviews, the pokercraze has faded a bit since gambling online became illegal and the movie opened togeneral...disinterest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But somehow it opened to $24 million and had enough legs to triple that takeand gross $81 million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How did that happen? But look back over the charts of the past few years and you can find a number of movies that seemed to do a lot better than you would guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did that dumb comedy Wild Hogs starring John Travolta and the perenially underestimated Tim Allen REALLY gross $168 million? Apparently. (All figures are US grosses alone.) Did The Rock and a little girl really hit $89 million with The Game Plan? Yep, and that's not nearly as shocking as Vin Diesel playing ananny in The Pacifier and raking in $113 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can never remember who starred in the anonymously named Failure To Launch (It was Matthew Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

Also out this week: two more exceptional Criterion releases, the Kurosawa drama High and Low and the wonderfully packaged and creepy Vampyr ($39.95 each; Criterion); if you're suddenly a fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal after The Dark Knight, check out her naughty turn in the nicely perverseSecretary ($14.98; Lionsgate); Robert Smigel's aggressively bawdy sketch show Comedy Central's TV Funhouse ($26.98; Paramount); Without The King ($24.95; First Run), an entertaining documentary about the last king of Swaziland that proves just about anyone will let camera crewsinto their lives - even clueless monarchs; Tom Selleck's in full control of Las Vegas Season Five ($59.98; Universal), though Josh Duhamel is still taller; NFLer Chad Johnson hosts In Just One Play: The Big-Play Men of the NFL ($19.98; Warner Bros.) though instead of 90 minutes of clips I'd rather watch them all be drug-tested; Andre Techine 4-Film Collector's Edition ($34.98; LionsGate) a bargain especially if you don't already own his acclaimed Wild Reeds from 1994; Twin Daggers ($26.98; LionsGate), a so-so chop-socky movie; Heavy Metal In Baghdad ($19.95; Arts Alliance), an engrossing documentary about Iraqis who just wanna rock; director Jean-Pierre Melville's last noir, Dirty Money ($19.98; LionsGate) starring the impossibly beautiful duo of Alain Delon and Catherine Deneuve; the festival hit labor of love comedy Big Dreams Little Tokyo($14.99; Echo Bridge), which was written and directed and stars Dave Boyle; the umpteenth spinon Spinal Tap, this one -- Brutal Massacre ($26.97; Anchor Bay) -- about a horror director tackling his magnum opus; mixed martial arts conquers the UK in Cage Rage Superstar Collection($14.98; Mill Creek) which gets huge props for including almost 60 fights amidst 13 hours offootage for a super-low price; and finally if you are tired of waiting for an IMAX screening of The Dark Knight that isn't sold out, check out the Blu-Ray edition of the campy 60s version Batman The Movie ($39.98; Fox).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POW!
