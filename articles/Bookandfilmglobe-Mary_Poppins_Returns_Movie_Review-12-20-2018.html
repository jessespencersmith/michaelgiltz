                <p>Saturday, February 16, 2019  FILM Get Lost, Mary Poppins! Practically Imperfect in Every Way  December 20, 2018 Michael Giltz Mary Poppins Returns purports to tell an all-new adventure of the practically perfect nanny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Making matters worse, the film is cast almost entirely with people who can’t sing or dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no, Lin-Manuel Miranda does not form the exception to that rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directed by Rob Marshall, the story features the same Banks children but now they’re all grown up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael(Ben Whishaw ) is a widower with three young kids of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broken by the death of his wife, the sweet, ineffectual Michael even snaps at the children once or twice! Mary Poppins pops in to set things right and she’s played by the very good actress Emily Blunt .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along for the ride in the role of lamplighter Jack is Miranda, Disney’s idea of street cred for a family-friendly musical.Every plot point, every scene, every song lines up with fanatical precision to the 1964 classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane’s mother championed the suffragette movement, so Jane campaigns for the rights of workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick Van Dyke , as a friend of the original Mary Poppins, sported a dreadful Cockney accent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This film casts another American inessentially the same role, with Miranda contractually obliged to deliver another bad accent.MARY POPPINS RETURNS (2/5 stars) Directed by: Rob Marshall Written by: David Magee Starring: Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer, Meryl Streep, Angela Lansbury, Colin Firth Running time: 130 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Originally, Poppins made doing chores fun, so in the sequel she makes taking a bath quite thetreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jumping into a chalk drawing and interacting with animated characters turns into jumping onto a painted bowl…and interacting with animated characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the original, they visit Mary’s Uncle Albert, who laughs so much he floats up to the ceiling .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They soon float up to join him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the sequel, they visit Mary’s cousin (Meryl Streep) and her entire home turns topsy turvy! Again they end up on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In both films, the kids create a ruckus at the bank where their father works, get lost on the way home and are led to safety by Mary’s friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilariously, in both films this action is interrupted by a massive song-and-dancenumber featuring Bert/Jack and his pals that goes on way, way too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This sequel reproduces even themodest flaws from the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, at the end of the first movie, the father and his children go fly a kite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the sequel? They fly a balloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary Poppins likes her jazz hot Beyond the painfully-identical trappings, this film gets the spirit all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Mary Poppins is arch! Coy! Ina misguided tribute to music hall and Rob Marshall’s movie Chicago, Mary Poppins even dons a Lulu wig and does a number in full-on Bob Fosse mode, with Miranda sort-of rapping because why not? It gives the decidedimpression this nanny wouldn’t mind a good shag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the original, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks loses his temper but Mary Poppins cannily manipulates him into doing precisely what she wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the sequel, Michael Banks gives Mary Poppins a dressing down…and she meekly submits.As Mary Poppins would never say, WTF? The songs aren’t awful but they’re no match for the peerless tunes by the Sherman Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, the first two are the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scene-setter “(Underneath The) Lovely London Sky” proves Miranda is a much better rapperthan singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it’s decently evocative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s followed by “A Conversation,” Michael’s mournful number about missing his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a brief moment, I imagined this film just might be distinctive and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the Xeroxing began, the whole, dreadful, déjà vu ofit all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s as if someone laid out the 1964 film on a table and placed tracing paper over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a small child sketched in the outline of every scene and every song before filling them in as best he could, tongue presumably stickingout of his mouth in fretful concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case that child is director Rob Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a bad film, but it’s also his best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He keeps the camera at a respectful distance, shoots dance sequences in full frame and avoids the manic editing of most modern musicals,including his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mary Poppins Returns is a slog, but bless him for trying. ← Willis’ Razor What Sucked In Movies This Year → Martin Landau Indicts Hollywood for Crimes and Misdemeanors  February 16, 2016 Robert Redford Premieres The Company You Keep  April 2, 2013Tags: Ben Whishaw , Dick Van Dyke , Emily Blunt , Lin-Manuel Miranda , Mary Poppins , Mary Poppins Returns , Meryl Streep , Rob Marshall Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for many outlets, such as New York Post,New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Huffington Post, PremiereMagazine, Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's co-host of the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox. You May Also LikeThree Tennis Docs To Get You Psyched For The U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open  August 24, 2018 Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * WebsiteSubscribe to our mailing list Social Twitter Facebook Recent Posts The Eyes Don’t Have It The Kids are Not All Right Nasty, Brutish, and Short‘Isn’t It Romantic?’ 31 Days of Oscar–Week Three Recent Comments Delores Sundbye on The New York Times Sends an Assassin to Kill Leonard Cohen Sharyn on Apocalypse Zhao Self-publishing News: Indies at the Movies | Alliance of Independent Authors: Self-Publishing Advice Center on Apocalypse ZhaoCasey on Apocalypse Zhao hng23 on The New York Times Sends an Assassin to Kill Leonard Cohen Archives February 2019January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018May 2017 February 2016 May 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014March 2014 December 2013September 2013 April 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 July 2012 November 2011 September 2011June 2011 May 2011 March 2011 May 2001 March 2001 October 2000 August 2000July 2000 June 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999 October 1999September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999 March 1999February 1999 September 1998June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 February 1998 October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 June 1997 May 1997April 1997 March 1997 February 1997 January 1997 November 1996 September 1996 August 1996June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 February 1996 January 1996 October 1995 August 1995February 1995 January 1995 CONTACT INFO EDITOR – Neal Pollack – neal@bookandfilmglobe.com GENERAL MANAGER/ADVERTISING – Kevin Sanders – ksanders@seaofreedsllc.com – 201-724-0340 VISIT OUR SUITE OF SITESCopyright © 2019, Book and Film GlobeAbout Us | Terms &amp; Conditions | Privacy Policy | Advertise with us |</p>
