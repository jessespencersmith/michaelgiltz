(I bet the Chocolate Factory in London does it right some day.)

Mary Beth Piele lands "Ah, Paris!" And then Jane Houdyshell (who wins over the crowd every moment she's on the stage with practiced ease) knocks it out of the park with "Broadway Baby." In between those "performances" of old we learn of the tangled relationship between Sally and Ben (a very good Ron Raines) and the miserable unhappiness of their respective spouses Buddy (DannyBurstein) and Phyllis (an excellent Jan Maxwell).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then it's topped by an even better show-stopper whenTerri White leads the whole gang in the sensational "Who's That Woman." It's so marvelous a scatterednumber of people in the audience bolted for the exits, assuming they'd just seen the act one finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nope,that song is followed by Elaine Paige embodying "I'm Still Here" (she triumphs by letting that song sellitself).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even that's not the end of the act, since as I said Follies truly yearns to be a gentle show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So after those two crowd-pleasers, it comes to a poignant end with the duet "Too Many Mornings" and Buddylooking on from the wings as his wife Sally and Ben indulge in a kiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a first act, filled with so many performers you want to see each and every one of these actors in their own show, soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could go home happy. (Indeed, I think one of the greatest nights of theaterimaginable would be seeing the first act of Follies , followed by the first act of Into The Woods and then the first act of Sunday In The Park With George .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, a fella can dream, can't he?) Act Two explodes all the fantasies indulged in by those antiquated musical revues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of oldvaudeville numbers, we get new vaudeville numbers that use the old forms to tell complex, wrenchingtales of broken hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intellectually, I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's rather static in a way because most of the songs tell us what we already learned in Act One, albeit with a little more self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what songs! "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow," "The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me-Blues," "The Story Of Lucyand Jessie," "Live, Laugh, Love" and of course "Losing My Mind" are razzle-dazzlers, even if emotionallywe're mostly spinning our wheels until Ben finally admits he's desperately unhappy at the finale and MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation PHOTOS: Kirstie Alley Makes Her Runway Debut Celestrellas: Miss Universe clarifies fraud allegations tarnishing Angola's crown Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) Danny Groner Sarah Palin, Glen Rice, and the Fleeting "Who Cares?"

This works most beautifully when Rosalind Elias and Leah Horowitz perform the light operetta sort of tune "One More Kiss." The elderly Heidi sings gloriously until the young Heidi appears behind her to belt it out even more beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon their voices are intertwined and competing and surging together as the memory of how she could sing in her younger days spurs Heidi on to one last marvelous note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's truly touching on somany levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jan Maxwell scores brilliantly as Phyllis, nobody's fool even though she's playing the fool for her successful husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's more sympathetic than the self-deluded Sally and also has the best lines;Maxwell makes the most of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's matched nicely by Raines every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burstein is goodas Buddy, though not in his big solo number that opens the second act, "The Right Girl." He's very goodin the dramatic scenes and the other numbers, but here he just didn't quite hold the stage. (I cruelly keptwondering if Norbert Leo Butz might step in when Burstein moves on.) Bernadette Peters is a pro, ofcourse, but her voice sounded a bit exhausted now that it was a few nights after the exhausting presspreviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no one could fault her skills as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end, this bravely low-key show has a stunner of a scene where Peters and Burstein are just onstage alone, saying nothing as she sees her last dream fade away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No dialogue, no song and yet the audience was gripped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So in short a three starperformance this night of a four star musical -- divide the difference and let's call it a 3 1/2 star night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butsomeday....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Hair *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 One Arm *** The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Silence!
