                <p>More Create Blog Sign In WEDNESDAY, APRIL 03, 2019 THEATER: "THE CRADLE WILL ROCK" PUTS YOU TO SLEEP THE CRADLE WILL ROCK * 1/2 out of **** CLASSIC STAGE COMPANY Our New Gilded Age is surely the perfect time to resurrect Marc Blitzstein's The Cradle Will Rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But time is not kind to agitprop in general or this pamphlet of a show in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like me, you may long to be roused, ready to look for the union label, mount the barricades and get fired up over injustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a lack of drama, character or story leaves nothing here but long speeches and short sketches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, the fatal lack of melodies for the handful of songs onhand won't even let you walk out humming a catchy tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is harmonytoo bourgeois? It's a landmark show, of course, whose premiere (directed by Orson Welles!) proved electrifying for how it was performed (rather than the show itself).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That story is so famous it inspired a so-so film about it byTim Robbins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This "play in music" (a musical ain't serious enough, I guess) was the first in Broadway history to garner an original cast recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now I know why -- despite all this laudable backstory--the show itself is rarely performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We begin with a desperate woman on the streets, ready to sell herself for half a buck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the man Mol solicits says that's too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's a human's body worth? Not much more than a human's dignity, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A cop breaks up this sad affair, only to pressure Moll (LaraPulver, who played the woman from Sherlock ) into having sex with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She refuses, he tosses her into the clink and a passel of local dignitaries are bundled into jail as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're anonymous members of the Liberty Committee, middle-class toadies who do the bidding of Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mister in "Steeltown, U.S.A."
