A: I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the reasons that New York is less interesting than it usedto be is because everything is so homogenized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always like to blame a lot of what happens in New York on Bloomberg because I want to blame everything on Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Did you blame Giuliani when he was in charge? A: I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the trajectory of my relationship to mayors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I used to say,“We could never ever have a mayor that is worse than Ed Koch.” Okay? Then I used to think, “We could never have a mayor worse than Giuliani.” And then we have Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We certainly couldnever have a mayor longer than Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q: Do you go to the theater? A: I don’t like the theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know, I’m a horrible person for saying that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though in fact, I’m going tonight to see “The Pee-wee Herman Show” because Paul More Print Sponsored Links $54/Hr Job: Work at Home $18-$54/hr Part-Time Job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Requirements: HomeInternet Access. www.News8Reports.com Make Money with Stocks Tricks to beat the stock market and to make a daiily Entertainment Best western Embrace the madness Just kidding...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Home TVMovies Music Fashion Theater Food Travel Pets Events Comics &amp; Games Columnists Blogs Horoscope Lifestyle NYC Local Business OpinionNews Vacay-Rod Alex Rodriguez and Cameron Diaz have their very own hot- stove...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gossip Celeb Photos PopWrapPage Six Family feud Uber-conservative Stephen Baldwin is bracing for a Baldwin...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teams High Schools Scores Sports Feeling 'Melo MEMPHIS — With each day, the Nets confidence seems to grow that...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS VIDEOS BLOGS weather icon 0 ° Today's Paper Login Register Classifieds Archives Subscribe More in Photos Click on Each Photo Video More in Videos VIEWED COMMENTEDMost Popular 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family feud 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spidey's tangled web 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hubby would take back 'vow' 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rabbi indicted on murder charges in killing of ex-cop 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; End for Andy? Reubens is a friend of mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How do you reach out to a friend who’s been arrested? A: During that escapade of Paul’s, I spoke to him on the phone a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I gave him some advice and he didn’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I told him, “Come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don’t run away.” He didn’t kill anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did say to him getting arrested for jerking off in a porn theater is like getting arrested for eating in a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s what they’re for! Q.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did you enjoy driving through the streets of New York while the Bernard Hermann score from “Taxi Driver” was playing in the background? A: That shooting was the most scared I’ve ever been in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We did that on a Saturday night right through Times Square where there are billions of people and billions of buses and cars and rickshaws and bicycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And horses! And I could not see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could not see the entire time I was driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of that night, I could hardly breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I kept saying, “I can’t see.” No one cared.And they wrecked my car — plugging things into the cigarette lighter, pulling panels out, taping things to the steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Afterward, I said, “You know, Marty, they just trashed my car.” He looked at me and said, “Fran, don’t you know never to allow people to make a movie in your caror your house?” Q: Do you regret publishing your second book? Because if you publish only one book it has a certain Harper Lee status to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course if you do three books you have a body of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But two is an awkward number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A: It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I still do not intend it to be the final number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do have two halves of two different books done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I did say recently to [Alfred A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Knopf editor-in-chief] Sonny Mehta, who is still my publisher, “You know what, Sonny, I have two unfinished books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you put them together, Ihave a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why don’t we publish the book, the first half of “Exterior Signs Of Wealth,” which is a novel? Then you turn it the other way around and you have “Progress,” which is non-fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People might think it’s some sort of post-modern trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in fact it’ll be a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Public speakingMonday, 10 p.m., HBO Like 60 likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sign Up to see what your friends like. 12 More PrintNYPOST Comments (0) You must be logged in to leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Login ι Registerliving from it. http://www.hototc.com Penny Stock Jumping 2000% Sign up to the #1 voted penny stock newsletter for free today! www.AwesomePennyStocks.com Buy a link here Sponsored Links Get Renting Advice Currency from Amex: Earn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sign Up Online Now!getcurrency.com $9 Car Insurance Breaking News: Car Insurance Companies Exposed - Get The Facts HereNewsToday9.com Business On Main Join The Community of Ideas, Tools, &amp; Resources, Connected by Sprint!www.BusinessOnMain.comREAD Can't find what you're looking for?
