One shudders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've started from scratch (again) because they know mystery buffs will line up and watch anything with stately homes, British accents...and murder .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But surely they're pushing it with the desultory batch of episodes in Agatha Christie Marple Series4 ($59.99; Acorn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Miss Marple is Julia McKenzie, of the delightful miniseries Cranford. (Well worth renting, that one.) Her Jane Marple is certainly a little more Marple-ish than McEwan's but still not spot-on for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Marple actually seems a bit overwhelmed and flustered at times, even rather confused. (Very mildly, of course.) Yes, she gently prods the local police towards the proper clues but there isn't as much fun made of this as there might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I might be reading too much into a banal reaction shot, but one touch I did like was a hint of passion for Marple: when her predictions come true and another person is murdered, a close-up of Marple reveals the barest hint of a thrill of delight coursing through her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At another point, she'sasked if she would ever consider heading to a mansion where murder is feared and the close-up shows Marple pretending to weigh the idea when of course wild bulls couldn't keep her away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no Marple could overcome the rote nature of these productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're offered 4 complete mysteries, each about 90 minutes in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first ("A Pocket Full Of Rye") takes a beastly half an hour to involve Marple properly in the goings-on and is unfortunately rather broadly comic intone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last, she takes a bit of a back seat to young people investigating their first crime (Sean Make HuffPost Your Home Most Popular on HuffingtonPost 1 of 2 More Advertisers Bolt Glenn Beck 3,067 Comments UNASSISTED TRIPLE PLAY: Phillie Eric Bruntlett Makes History (VIDEO) 278 Comments KFC's Double Down Sandwich: Is Chicken Instead Of Bread... 720 Comments Rachel Strugatz Rachel Zoe's Studio: See What's Inside (PHOTOS) 25 Comments Kari Henley The Difference Between Stress And Burnout 59 Comments Greg Mitchell One Year Ago, a Turning Point in... 221 Comments Jeremy Scahill Slams Chuck Todd, Media, Congress Over Blackwater... 1,427 Comments Rosemary Port, OutedBIG NEWS: Britney Spears | The Oscars | Health Action | Susan Boyle | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Michael Giltz: DVDS: New Miss Marple Doesn't Slay Me and More http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-new-miss-marple-does_b_252210.html[8/25/09 5:19:25 PM]Biggerstaff of Harry Potter is the main one).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, all four include the usual array of top-notch British talent: Brian Cox, Rupert Graves, Shirley Henderson, Matthew Macfayden, Jemma Redgrave, Prunella Scales, Samantha Bond, Alex Jennigns and even Joan Collins are all on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But every episode contains a clutch of lesserperformers who are genuinely bad and overact in the extreme, to the point of provoking laughter. (Blood...will... out!" sputters one young woman in "They Do It With Mirrors," rather hilariously.) And the casting of big names, as so often happens, provides the most obvious clues of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Iranked the episodes, I would be choosing which one was the least weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the biggest crime here is the one committed against Agatha Christie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also Out This Week: Ballerina ($24.95; First Run) -- It took me a few weeks to catch up with this documentary about five dancers in the Russian Kirov (aka Mariinsky).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five women range in age and disciplines, but their talent and extreme hard work link them completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You see rehearsals and exercise and pain and talk with them while preparing for performances of crowd-pleasers like Swan Lake and Romeo &amp; Juliet .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even those warhorses are incredibly demanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, dance lovers will love this, but it's a testament to the sweat that goes into any artistic endeavor worth the name and anyone can appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out is the charming Carmen &amp; Geoffrey ($24.95; First Run), which captures the remarkable love story and artistic accomplishments of dancers Carmen de Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll appreciate my ignorance of the world of dance when I tell you I only knew Holder as the guy from those 7-Up ads and the James Bond film Live and Let Die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Race To Witch Mountain ($39.99 Special Edition and $44.99 BluRay; Disney) -- Okay, before I bemoan the changes made to Escape To Witch Mountain (what, kids think the word "escape" is too dull so they changed it to "race") not to mention the inclusion of The Rock, let's be clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had fond thoughts for the original Seventies kid flick but it was pretty tame, even at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Race To Witch Mountain doesn't soil a beloved classic, it just takes a high concept idea and revamps it for today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No harm, no foul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no good movie, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BluRay costs $5 more than the SpecialEdition but only $3 more on sale at Amazon ($25.99 versus $22.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the single disc edition costs only $15.99 on sale, which is a very substantial difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's nice to see BluRay and SpecialEdition DVDs coming closer in price, but until they're regularly under $20, fans won't bother witheither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BluRay does contain a regular DVD along with the digital copy that also comes with the Special Edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is all that confusing? For $26 instead of $16, you can get a lot of flexibility (a copy for the BluRay player, a regular DVD for the kid's room and road trips and a digital copy to carryon a laptop or other device).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's a lot of money for a little convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kudos to them forreleasing all three versions at the same time, but cut out all the bonus features or keep them and lower the price and drop the stripped down one-disc version and send those only to video stores and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The array of choices is confusing and wasteful and tiresome and BluRay is about to go under for good if it hasn't already as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flight of the Conchords Second Season ($29.98; HBO) -- During the first season of this show about a New Zealand duo looking for pop success in the US, I often fast-forwarded to the always delightful musical numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But slowly the show is growing on me or the guys are justfinding their rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In either case, it's become a quiet charmer...even when they're not singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Soloist ($29.98; DreamWorks) -- Oscar bait, but no one was nibbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The TV movie-ready story of a down on his luck newspaper reporter (Robert Downey Jr) helping out a talentedhomeless man (Jamie Foxx) with a gift for classical music) is pure mawkishness that two fine actors can't overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shape of the World ($59.99; Athena) -- This six-part PBS miniseries turns the science of cartography -- map-making -- into an exploration of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Narrated by Patrick Stewart, it does have the air of a lecture, but a very good lecture indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teens might think they won't be interested,but they will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's often damning with faint praise to say a series can inform and educate you, but that surely was the goal here and they achieved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Project Runway Season 5 ($27.95; Genius) -- The most star-studded PR yet, with guests like Sandra Bernhard, LL Cool J, Brooke Shields and Natalie Portman popping in alongside Tim Gunn and Heidi Klum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The men were completely shut out of the female-dominated final three and rightlyso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while a reality series might be the wrong place to make this argument, why do they wait till right before the beginning of the new season to release a show on DVD? In the UK, they release shows on DVD as soon as the series ends (sometimes, even while it's still airing) and thatpiggybacking on all the reviews and publicity seems smart to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who wants to catch up before the new season only has a blink of an eye to do it here. (That's really a pain when it comes to 24, for example.) Get it out as soon as the show ends; don't hold onto it until right before the new "Skanks" Blogger Who Trashed Model, Angry... 802 Comments Paul Krugman: We Are In Economic "Purgatory" (VIDEO) 3,876 Comments Miss Universe 2009: Who Do You Think Should Have... 189 Comments Don't Miss HuffPost Bloggers Yukio Hatoyama Japan Must Shake Off US-Style Globalization Gary Hart Democracy in the Mirror of Afghanistan Alec Baldwin Remembering Don Hewitt, Taking Woodstock, Michael Vick and More Gordon Brown Taking Women’s Rights Seriously Get Breaking News Alerts Report Corrections Send A Tip Anna Paquin &amp; Stephen Moyer Kept Romance Quiet on True Blood Set READ MORE Alyssa Milano's Tropical Honeymoon READ MORE Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley to Co-Host CMAs READ MORE Health Care Glenn Beck Food Barack Obama England Oprah Michael Jackson Britney Spears MagazinesHuffPost Social News connects you with friends and the news More Celebrity News at People.com HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Michael Giltz: DVDS: New Miss Marple Doesn't Slay Me and More http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-new-miss-marple-does_b_252210.html[8/25/09 5:19:25 PM] Miss Universe 2009: Who Do You Think...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATED: Coroner Rules Jackson's Death Homicide, Murray...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan Jenkins Dead In Motel Room After...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heidi Pratt's Miss Universe Striptease (VIDEO)season begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tigger Movie: 10th Anniversary Edition ($29.99; Disney) -- I don't like endless spin- offs of Disney characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really don't like the direct-to-DVD mush (though this one was released theatrically) and I don't think a character like Tigger -- a classic supporting role if ever there was one -- should be front and center, any more than I want to see a Peanuts film focusing on Snoopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So sue me, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Tigger Movie is the exception, thanks to songs by the legendary Sherman Brothers, great voice work and a better than average script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gentle fare that can hold its head high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if it leads you to reading the A.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Milne books aloud to your kids, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extras include two new Tigger shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Love Boat Season 2 Volume 2 ($36.98; Paramount) -- How in God's name did I sit and watch this series every Saturday night as a kid? It is almost embarrassingly predictable and trite, with the least sexy crew-members on a cruise ship ever. (And where are the gay cruise shipemployees?) Heartily condemned by critics at the time and now I'm old enough to know they wereright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that this stopped me from skipping ahead to the episode starring Charo and you may feel compelled to search out the ones with Sonny Bono, Corey Feldman, Reggie Jackson, Minnie Pearl and the like, depending on your taste or age range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, regular folk had Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But aging celebs had The Love Boat .

I loved her work in "Mulberry," but the jarring music-video-type editing of McEwan's Marpleepisodes never seemed to give her a chance to get her bearings as Miss Marple -- the production stylewas completely out of character for what was supposed to be a slower-paced time than our Twitter-based society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was as though the directors and editors themselves were impatient with their owncreation and wanted to rush each story through to its conclusion before they themselves fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank goodness they've slowed down a bit for this latest Marple incarnation (and I am a fan of Julie McKenzie), still - Joan Hickson owns it. margo152 I'm a Fan of margo152 permalink A vote for Margaret Rutherford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh that's right Margaret is not with us any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But someone likeMargaret would be great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Miss Marple has hit a real high for being BORING!

Rutherford took herself and the role very, very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itwas her big disappointment in life that no-one else did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Say what you will about her Miss Marple, (Christie herself was none too keen on it) but slapstick it most definitely was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor Margaret would be spinning in her grave. wm1066 I'm a Fan of wm1066 22 fans permalink Maybe slapstick was too strong a word for you, but if you watched thoseproductions they had a hokey soundtrack that evoked humor that was outof character for a murder mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sleepyjohns I'm a Fan of Sleepyjohns 2 fans permalink Joan Hickson and Geraldine McEwan were spot on Marples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find it odd that your characterization ofMcEwan's work in the role as a "flop" has to do with a fictive addition developed by the writers ratherthan a real critique of her take on Jane Marple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Odd and insulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Hickson nailed the 'I've seeneverything of the world from my garden' and gave the character compelling sagacity, McEwan'stwinkling-eye and impish smile further fleshed out this beloved character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just watch McEwan andJohn Hanna interact in The 4.50 From Paddington; watching them together makes the whole film worthit. 3reddogs I'm a Fan of 3reddogs 2 fans permalink Sorry, but if you had actually read any of Agatha Christie's "Miss Marple" books you'd knowthat Hickson's and McEwan's portrayals (stature, mannerisms, etc) come a lot closer to JaneMarple than Julia McKenzie's robust stature, bland personality, and totally uninspired performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, I think we agree that no one (Robert Downey, Jr. included) will ever match Jeremy Brett's take on Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two different actors played Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson but, let's face it, you're so riveted byBrett's screen presence that you barely notice Watson :-) sallythewerewolf I'm a Fan of sallythewerewolf 4 fans permalink Didn't Helen Hayes play Miss Marple once? rzan1 I'm a Fan of rzan1 27 fans permalink Geraldine McEwan was totally delightful as Miss Marple and brought a bit more depth to the character.You are wrong in your assessment. countfloyd I'm a Fan of countfloyd 3 fans permalink "They've started from scratch (again) because they know mystery buffs will line up and watch anythingwith stately homes, British accents...and murder." I will watch a mystery where you can't figure out who did it in the first 30 seconds, are well written and feature really good actors in the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That eliminates almost all american cop shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ponderus I'm a Fan of Ponderus 165 fans permalink Geraldine McEwan brought something almost unrecognizable to the paper thin "characters" is Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:15 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:31 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:38 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:17 PM on 08/08/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:03 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:57 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:50 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:57 AM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:56 AM on 08/07/2009Michael Giltz: DVDS: New Miss Marple Doesn't Slay Me and More http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-new-miss-marple-does_b_252210.html[8/25/09 5:19:25 PM] Christieland: recognizable humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe that's what threw you off, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Giltz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She went deeper than any of the Marples before her -- and McKenzie continues in this vein with her unshockable, subtly worldly, cooly amused -- but morally adamant -- take on Miss M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're just mistaken -- and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rocket Age Magician I'm a Fan of Rocket Age Magician permalink Sorry, Michael, but we can't ALL agree that Geraldine McEwan's tenure as Miss Marple was a flop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It certainly wasn't business-wise, her three series did extremely well in England and were very popular.In the NY Times and SF Chronicle reviews of the McKenzie series, both hold McEwan up as the goldstandard Marple, one proclaiming Joan Hickson "icy," and the other a bore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hickson was for sometastes, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Suchet is the definitive Poirot, but there simply isn't one for Marple, and all thecontenders, including Lansbury, Rutherford, Hickson, McEwan, and now McKenzie (for that matter,even Gracie Fields from her one appearance) have a claim to the old busybody's knitting needles. sexyrexy I'm a Fan of sexyrexy 9 fans permalink let's not forget Albert Finney as Poirot in MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. loved thecostumes.. love McEwan generally but not as Marple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NHBill I'm a Fan of NHBill 8 fans permalink Finney is great in almost everything, but his Poirot was a unforgettable. wm1066 I'm a Fan of wm1066 22 fans permalink David Suchet seems lost without Hastings! 3reddogs I'm a Fan of 3reddogs 2 fans permalink I miss Hastings too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hard to believe Suchet's been doing Poirot for 20 years!! Also bummed that there's only going to be two Poirots this timearound - Cat Among the Pigeons and Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGinty's Dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Hastings will show up to exclaim over Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGinty's carcass :-) sexyrexy I'm a Fan of sexyrexy 9 fans permalink true about Jeremy Brett as the definitive Holmes.. and I personally feel the same way about JoanHickson.. she spoilt Miss Marple for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angelea Lansbury played her in MIRROR CRACK'ED.. and now it Julia's Mc Kenzie.. not the same..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miss Hickson it is. by the way-- I had the good fortune to meet Agatha Christie's daughter with her husband on set of Inspector Poirot..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had such a big kick out of it..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NHBill I'm a Fan of NHBill 8 fans permalink I think Brett benefited from more modern sensibilities and greater production values than Rathbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But ole Basil left an indelible mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:01 AM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:46 AM on 08/06/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:49 AM on 08/06/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:02 AM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:17 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:14 PM on 08/07/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:08 PM on 08/05/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:06 AM on 08/07/2009Michael Giltz: DVDS: New Miss Marple Doesn't Slay Me and More http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-new-miss-marple-does_b_252210.html[8/25/09 5:19:25 PM]Agatha Christie DVDs www.daedalusbooks.com Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot 17 DVDs for $74.98 HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type</p>
