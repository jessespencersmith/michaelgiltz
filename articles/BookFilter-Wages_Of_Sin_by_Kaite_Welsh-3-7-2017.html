She is determined to become a doctor despite themisgivings of her family and society, but Sarah quickly finds plenty of barriers at school itself: professors who refuse to teach their new pupils, male students determined to force out their female counterparts, and—perhaps worst of all—her female peers who will do anything to avoid beingassociated with a fallen woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Desperate for a proper education, Sarah turns to one of the city’s ramshackle charitable hospitals for additional training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The St Giles’ Infirmary for Women ministers to the downtroddenand drunk, the thieves and whores with nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Even worse, she wants to study medicine and be a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, in 1892 a woman who wants an education and a career is in many ways even more disreputable than a mere trollop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah is banished to Scotland, out of sight of her family but happily one of the few places women are tentatively allowed to pursue their passion.Sarah must fight the shunning of her fellow female students, the constant heckling (and worse) they all get from the maleShare This Book About The Author Kaite Welsh MoreKaite Welsh is an Edinburgh-based journalist and critic and the Literature Officer at Creative Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Oh, and fight the urge to indulge in a taste for laudanum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, and solve the murder of a prostitute that no one cares about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's good fun and the characters are vivid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the setting and non-mystery elements are much stronger than the mystery itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our heroine does very little detecting as such -- she merely stumblesacross various suspects and then impulsively follows them, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she is rescued after stumbling onto thetruth, which is unsatisfying in every.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While it fails as a mystery, Welsh does keep the pages turning and perhaps she'll makeher heroine more active in both solving the crime and protecting herself come the inevitable sequel. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Sarah is a spunky but historically accurate heroine, bucking the most restrictive traditions in order to comment on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Debut of the Month) Welsh makes clever use of the conventions of the genre while throwing in a twist informed by modern sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Damp, sooty, moralistic, and sinning Edinburgh is convincingly evoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A gritty detective story as unflinching as its heroine, rich in well-researched period detail. - Kirkus Reviews A moving, nuanced first novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Superior characterizations and convincing period detail. - Publishers Weekly It’s rare to find a truly fresh new voice in fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Welsh’s writing is intense, passionate, and dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She turns phrases until they’re exquisitely wrought, and fashions from the raw material of language something beautifuland unique. - Emma Rees, author of 'The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History' What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
