She is determined to become a doctor despite themisgivings of her family and society, but Sarah quickly finds plenty of barriers at school itself: professors who refuse to teach their new pupils, male students determined to force out their female counterparts, andâ€”perhaps worst of allâ€”her female peers who will do anything to avoid beingassociated with a fallen woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Desperate for a proper education, Sarah turns to one of the cityâ€™s ramshackle charitable hospitals for additional training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The St Gilesâ€™ Infirmary for Women ministers to the downtroddenand drunk, the thieves and whores with nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Even worse, she wants to study medicine and be a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, in 1892 a woman who wants an education and a career is in many ways even more disreputable than a mere trollop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Oh, and fight the urge to indulge in a taste for laudanum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, and solve the murder of a prostitute that no one cares about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's good fun and the characters are vivid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the setting and non-mystery elements are much stronger than the mystery itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our heroine does very little detecting as such -- she merely stumblesacross various suspects and then impulsively follows them, for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
