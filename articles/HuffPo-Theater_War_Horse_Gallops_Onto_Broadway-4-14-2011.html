The show is so tough-minded you won't be so certainhalfway through as you might be when you walk in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tonally, this production helmed by Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris is very similar to London, with a few modest changes that make it slightly more obvious and slightly darker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The goose, oddly enough isdownplayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember it vividly as amusing comic relief, but its role seems reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I believe -- butcan't be certain -- that certain scenes featuring both the English and French and/or Germans includedmore dialogue in native tongues to mirror the confusion they felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, when the Germans orFrench are alone, they speak English with accents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those accents feel less comfortable for this Americancast than they did in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presumably imitating your neighbors is easier than imitating someone faraway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The score by Adrian Sutton is very prominent, almost ever-present, a la a film score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's often stirring but sometimes seems intrusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The very effective folk singing woven throughout (with songs by John Tams)works best at the stirring beginning and end, both of which will send chills up your spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A secondviewing hasn't deepened the show for me, unfortunately, but it's unquestionably solid entertainment withsuperlative technical elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It must be the way the part is written because I found the father a bit overplayed here, just like I did in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise the cast led by the appealing Numrich is solid (with the exception of those accents).But it's the talent that brings Joey to life that is the real star here. (Tpby Sedgwick is the director ofmovement and horse sequences.) No wonder the young and adult Joey get the final bow and the biggestroar of applause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 2010-2011 THEATER SEASON (ratings on a four star system) Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
