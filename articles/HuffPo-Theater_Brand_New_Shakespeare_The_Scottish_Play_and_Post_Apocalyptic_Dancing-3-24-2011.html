He might have co-written this short romance with John Fletcher under the titleCardenio , only to have it freely adapted by Lewis Theobald in the 1700s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theobald himself claimed it wasindeed based on manuscripts by Shakespeare for a playthat was never mounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it is Shakespeare, it's certainly thin stuff from late in his career, when he had run out of things to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story echoes many earlier works with star-crossed lovers betrayed, a young woman disguised as a boy and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henriquez is the prodigal son of a Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henriquez tries to woo Violante and when sherebuffs him he turns to rape and violates her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not satisfied, he also sends the lovelorn Julio off on anerrand so Henriquez can woo Julio's true love Leonora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's not won over, but her father -- realizing theprospects for the son of a Duke are much better than Julio's - is delighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 WATCH: Two New Yorkers Take A Taxi To Los Angeles 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Poll Shows One Potential Presidential Hopeful InFOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The happily paired Julio and Leonora are thrilled while Violante is forced to marry Henriquez, about the only option for a ravaged woman in that age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The production by Brian Kulick is simple enough, employing giant rugs scattered across the stage that are moved about in combination to provide different groupings of actors at different points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No play needs any more if it's good and well performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The thin Double Falsehood unfortunately is not, with the villain Henriquez simply being bad and getting his comeuppance in a rather routine manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mosteveryone in the cast has their ups and downs performance-wise, though the women fare especiallypoorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They gesture and act out many of the phrases and ideas in their lines, the sort of movement thatshould have been scaled back or abandoned once they had the sense of the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The men aren't much better, with Slate Holmgren doing better early on as Henriquez before his villainy became so broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The standouts are Philip Goodwin, bringing dignity and clarity to multiple roles and Clayton Apgar as Julio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who wrote the play is not as important as whether the play is any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This production certainly doesn't reveal a long-lost treasure, whomever the author may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MACBETH ** THE DUKE ON 42ND ST.Theater For A New Audience has had a wonderful run of clearly presented, illuminating Shakespearean plays, such as their Othello and Hamlet of recent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, that is not the case for this under- rehearsed production directed by Arin Arbus that never comes into focus.You know the play: Macbeth is victorious in battle and gets honors from his king, but that's not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the tantalizing predictions of three witches and the poisonous urgings of his bloody wife pushinghim on, Macbeth slaughters his way to the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happiness does not ensue, for no sooner does he claimpower than he fears it will all be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The look is Scottish, with the set quite gloomy and all the men garbed in military attire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three witches are played by men in full, barbaric Braveheart style -- their preening and would-be spookiness is just the first of a number of false notes, not helped by several members of the cast stumbling a bit on their lines.John Douglas Thompson has been truly excellent in Othello and The Emperor Jones , to name two recent triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's possible he'll find his way in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at the moment, Macbeth seems lost andweak from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annika Boras has the worst of it as Lady Macbeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this were the onlyproduction you saw, you'd never imagine she was a major character and certainly never think she hadany spine or drove her husband to the deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her mad scene is more Ophelia than Lady Macbeth, nuttyrather than guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the main characters are not working, you often find secondary scenes feel fresher and more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly the case here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The death of Macduff's wife and son (often cut from mostproductions) is the only one that gives us a sense of horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the meeting in which Malcolm (JustinBlanchard) and Macduff (Albert Jones) join forces to defeat Macbeth feels suddenly like the heart of theplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Jay Fernandez is notably crisp and effective in various roles, a standout in a show where manyof the performances feel rushed or ill-conceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second act is a little more energetic, thanks to thosescenes in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's too little too late, just as Macbeth realizes too late that the promise "no manborn of woman" can harm him doesn't mean he's impossible to defeat after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BETWEEN WORLDS/ENTRE MUNDOS * 1/2 NEW WORLD STAGESIn the future, environmental disasters destroy the world, reducing human life to a few scattered tribes fighting over precious water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Flamenco tribe is lovely and beautiful, led by Siudy , the savior who is pure of heart and might save them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Urban tribe -- dressed like East Village punks because that'show the crazies always dress in a dystopia for some reason -- dance in a more hip-hop style and poundon drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siudy is captured by the Urban tribe and falls in love with Benjamin (played by LukeMannikus), who betrayed her but loves her and maybe their love can save us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Striking Distance Of Obama Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
