                <p>Net's trick fl·c Spoiling the plot for deceptive online movie listings By MICHAEl GlI,;TZ SAVVY New Yorkers know that if they want to see a blockbuster like "King Kong" on opening night, they've got to buy their tickets days -or even weeks -in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the two main ticker sell­ ers -Moviefone and Fan­ dango -aren't interested In helping you fmd the most convenient movie theater at the best time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their job is [0 sell you tickets to their movie chains and steer YOll away from their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With big films like "Kong" and "Munich" on the hori­ zon, here's how you can avoid the traps they lay for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll use the recent debut of ''Harry Potier and the Goblet of Fire" as an example. ~ Moviefone&amp; Fandango Each company has exclu­ sive deals with certain movie chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often, until opening day, their sites feature incomplete listing ornitting competitors' theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Selling tickets [0 favored chains -with a nice sur­ cha.rge -is where the com­ panies make most of their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when buying tick­ ets before a movie has opened, make sure you check both Web sites regu­ larly to see what theaters your movie is playing before youcommlt. can't find a good showtime? Just be patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just 48 hour before "Potter" opened on Nov. 18, Loews 34th Srreet listed only one "batch" of show­ times -with only one prime showing at 8 p.rn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, a movie like "Potler" will premiere on a gazillion screens, and a multiplex like Loews 34th will be showing it at multi­ ple times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if it looks like they're showing the times for only one screen and it's already sold out, be patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't buy tiClkets to [hat 5 p.m. or II p.m. showing if you can hold off and keep checking online and by phone: More times will be added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you have to be vigilant and check regularly - there's no t !ling when more showings will pop up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you're trying to buy tickets to a movie like "Brokeback Mountain" or "Syriana," check Web sites like upcom­ ingmovies.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They might be opening only on a handful of screens before going into wider release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't hang up if they start listing theaters in Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many times, people use these phone services just to learn theaters and show­ limes near y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when the automated voke begins with chains a few blocks away and then starts listing locations In Brooklyn and even New Jersey, people hang up thlnking they've heard all the 10cations nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These services often list aU of the chains they have deals with fIrst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may have to skip through 10 or more listings before they mention a competitor's theater only a block or two away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day "Potter" opened, Movlefone listed City Cin­ ema's East 86th Street loca­ tion sixth on its list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fan­ dango listed it 17th -after iocations in Queens, Brooklyn and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fandango listed the United Artis s Union Square Loca­ tion fifth; Moviefone llsted it 14th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When onrme. read a06stings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They pull the same stunt online, where movie the­ ater locations are usually shown in batches of fIve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may have to scroll through five or six "-pages" before finding the theater you want buried at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you were in Harlem and wanted to see "Potter" on opening day, Moviefone listed tbe Coliseum The­ ater on 181st Street fourth when you entered the 10033 rip code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fandango listed the Coliseum 13th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, nei.rber serv­ i.e is "better" than the orb­ er.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They both list th chains they have deals with first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HARRIED FOR HARRY? You can land tix to hot flicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So uyou want to get into a blockbuster on openlug night, your best bet is to check online and by pbone early and often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go by your local theater a week or two in advance; they might be selling tickets in person and you can avoid the $1.50 service cbarge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And once a movie's opened, the sur st way to find out all the places a film is playing is to buy the New York Post and check out the ads and movie listings.</p>
