Many prefer the audiobook versions because David Sedaris is such a terrific performer, bringing out the acid wit and dark undercurrents of his essays with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others enjoy diving in as soon as a new pieceappears in The New Yorker or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the time a new collection arrives, it's more like a greatest hits collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And most people reading a collection probably gobble it down quickly, giggling all the while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But to appreciate his talent in theShare This Book About The Author David Sedaris David Sedaris is the author of the booksTheft by Finding, Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls, Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk , When You Are Engulfed in Flames , Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim , Me Talk Pretty One Day, Holidays on Ice , Naked , and Barrel Fever .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is a regular contributor to The New Yorker and BBC Radio 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $30.00 (Hardcover) Published: May 29, 2018 Publisher: Little, Brown and Company Pages: 432 ISBN 10: 0316392367 ISBN 13: 9780316392365best possible light, might I suggest you read his new collection, but not all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And not too slowly either! Go too slow and you'll miss the over-arching wholeness he brings to these stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read them too quickly and the humor blurs together, like binge-watching five episodes of a sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tackle them just so and you can laugh yourself silly while feeling the weight of what he's really writing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here as perhaps never before, Sedaris shines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He captures the difficult of family, the painof addiction, the way only a loved one can truly wound you, the surprise over a parent who frustrates and surprises youalmost as much as you do the same for them, and how you can shock yourself with a capacity for cruelty or just theindifference you need to survive when someone you love is drowning and threatens to pull you under. "Calypso" is very funny, but it's no laughing matter. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "It seemed that this entrancing collection of essays, and my fascination with its author, had sucked me into some nerdy netherworld where real life becomes weirder and funnier and darker and bleaker than, well, reallife...The brilliance of David Sedaris's writing is that his very essence, his aura, seeps through the pages of his books like an intoxicating cloud."â Alan Cumming , New York Times Book Review - "The king of the humorous essay returns with a brand-new collection -- his first in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris fans will find plenty of familiar delights: His misanthropic charms and wry wit are as delightful as ever, even if some ofthe subject matter has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From his new vacation home on the coast of North Carolina, he writes aboutthe concerns of health and aging, treating us to a story about the persnickety doctor who refused to let himkeep a noncancerous tumor that he'd planned to feed to a snapping turtle once removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We can only assumethat the audiobook version of Calypso will be the perfect travel companion during road trips and getaways this spring and beyond."â Maris Kreizman , New York Magazine - "Age and family occupy beloved humorist Sedaris's latest collection of essays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His observations feel sharper and often darker than in previous collections, as he ponders the inevitable breakdown of the human body, the shame attendant with illness and age, the nature of addiction, and the eccentricities of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though middle age may have made his shades of gray blacker, the wit and incisiveness that make Sedaris much-adoredremain."â Lauren Hubbard , Harper's Bazaar - "Sedaris hasn't lost his capacity for bemused observations of the people he encounters...But bad news has sharpened the author's humor, and this book is defined by a persistent, engaging bafflement over how seriously or unseriously to take life when it's increasingly filled with Trump and funerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris at his darkest--and hisbest."â Kirkus (starred review) - "If you're ever stuck in an elevator or airport, just pray for David Sedaris to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time passes quickly with thisnational treasure of a storyteller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading Calypso is like settling into a glorious beach vacation with the author, whose parents, siblings and longtime boyfriend, Hugh, feel like old friends to faithful readers...While Sedaris islaugh-out-loud funny in his brilliant, meandering way, it's his personal reflections that will stay with you."â Alice Cary, Bookpage - "Sedaris collects 21 essays largely about family bonds and getting older in this hilarious yet tender volume...Theauthor's fans and newcomers alike will be richly rewarded by this sidesplitting collection."â Publishers Weekly (starred review) - PRAISE FOR THEFT BY FINDING: "An observant, acidic writer...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The prickly Southern wit is still intact and sparkling...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's helpful to see that avoice as original, hilarious and sometimes as infuriating as his was put through the same Struggle and Starvemeat grinder that most of us go through." âPatton Oswalt , New York Times Book Review - "If it's hard to be funny, it's an astounding feat to stay funny--wildly, wickedly, ingeniously so--for more than twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet David Sedaris has somehow pulled it off, in exhilarating essays that zero in on the absurd andthe poignant with eviscerating wit and radiant humanity."âFiona Maazel , O, The Oprah Magazine - "Mesmerizing...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delightful...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris describes the world around him... the vast and splendid array of human lifethat can be observed at IHOP, or the vagaries of fruit picking...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading Theft by Finding is like watching a favorite play from behind the scenes, in the company of a friend who can identify what is absurd andheartbreaking and human about every person on stage." âAnnalisa Quinn , NPR - "Whether he's in an IHOP in Raleigh or his apartment in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, Sedaris's eye for the absurd and the vulgar is infallible and his deadpan prose style inimitable...His personal essays are put togetherso carefully that none of the seams show; they often ingeniously build to a sneak attack of wisdom or poignancyin the final lines."â Marion Winik , Newsday - "Sedaris has become a reigning master of crystalline social commentary and blisteringly humorous self-reflection.His unforgettable autobiographical essay collections have become modern classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They reveal the author's life in unsparingly personal, often gritty, always poignant detail." âLauren Christensen , Los Angeles Times - "Sedaris, a master of incisive and comic cultural criticism, is about to get more personal than ever...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theft by Finding reveals intimate details of this literary luminary's life and mind--all told with his singular sense of humor."âHarper's Bazaar - "Randomly open to any page in Theft by Finding and you'll find a gem...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris's gift is to make you stop and think one moment and laugh out loud the next." âRob Merrill , Associated Press - "This is Sedaris, who can be wickedly funny as well as deliciously insightful about modern mores...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His eccentric existence is eminently enthralling." âDavid Holahan , USA Today - "The thrill of Sedaris's nonfiction lies in the absurd details of his memories, burnished with...polish and comictiming." âBoris Kachka , New York - "Sedaris fans will thrill to this opportunity to poke around in the writer's personal diaries, which he has faithfully kept for four decades and used as raw material for his hilarious nonfiction as well as his performances." âPaul S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Makishima , Boston Globe - "Sedaris's diaries are the wellspring for his cuttingly funny autobiographical essays, and he now presents a mesmerizing volume of deftly edited passages...Sedaris is caustically witty about his bad habits and artisticfloundering...A candid, socially incisive, and sharply amusing chronicle of the evolution of an arresting comedic artist." âDonna Seaman , Booklist (Starred Review) - "Raw glimpses of the humorist's personal life as he clambered from starving artist to household name...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though the mood is usually light, the book is also a more serious look into his travails as an artist and person...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asurprisingly poignant portrait of the artist as a young to middle-aged man." âKirkus (Starred Review) - "A David Sedaris book is always a welcome addition to any personal library -- his hilarity, his self-deprecation, his compassion for (and amusement with) the human condition, and his clear joy at making his readers laugh outloud are all what make a David Sedaris book great."â E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ce Miller , Bustle - "Scintillating...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris is a latter-day Charlie Chaplin: droll, put-upon but not innocent, and besieged by all sorts of obstreperous or menacing folks...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris's storytelling, even in diary jottings, is consistently well-crafted andhilarious."â Publishers Weekly (Starred Review) - "Sedaris hasn't lost his capacity for bemused observations of the people he encounters...But bad news hassharpened the author's humor, and this book is defined by a persistent, engaging bafflement over how seriouslyor unseriously to take life when it's increasingly filled with Trump and funerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris at his darkest--and hisbest."â Kirkus Reviews - PRAISE FOR LET'S EXPLORE DIABETES WITH OWLS "Deeply satisfying....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris can bring to mind Anthony Trollope, P.G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wodehouse, Alice Munro, and WoodyAllen, sometimes in the same paragraph."--David Carr, New York Times Book Review - "Quintessential Sedaris....Essays on everything from air travel to today's child-rearing techniques by a writerwho's a master of pointing out the absurd in everyday life." ---Craig Wilson, USA Today - "Sedaris is a remarkably skilled storyteller and savvy essayist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He weaves together vivid images and sensationsinto a coherent whole that packs a serious emotional punch....Yes, David Sedaris is really that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And based,on this latest collection, he's getting only better." ---Heather Havrilesky, Los Angeles Times - "Over-the-top ruminations on life, death, and the joys of French dental work...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sedaris makes the mundanehilarious."--Danielle Trussoni, People - "The funniest writer in America....Sedaris is thoughtful and sweet in addition to being slyly hilarious." ---Leigh Haber, O, the Oprah Magazine - "David Sedaris has become a signifier of taste and intelligence....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls was the kind of book that I finished and just immediately wanted to start reading again." ---Anna Peele, Esquire - "David Sedaris's biggest strength as an essayist and a humorist lies in his remarkable power of observation, ofdetecting the humor and pathos is the everyday conversations most of us don't register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His attention and wit are as incisive as ever, but Sedaris brings a stronger sense of self to the pages of Calypso ...It's both warmer and bleaker than any Sedaris that's come before."â Laura Adamczyk and Caitlin Penzeymoog , AV Club - "Sedaris is widely considered is widely considered America's leading humorist, and his new book Calypso does nothing but burnish that reputation."â Nic Brown , Garden &amp; Gun - "Calypso is the most family-centered of his books yet and, although much of it is very funny, it's also his most melancholy as it addresses aging and loss...it ranges across a number of other subjects as well, often withSedaris's trademark off-center, self-deprecating humor."â Colette Bancroft , Tampa Bay Times - What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
