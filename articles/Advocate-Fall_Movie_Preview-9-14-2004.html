                <p>FALL ENTERTAINMENT PREVIEW Let's all go to the lobby By Michael Giltz *SEPTEMBER * A Letter to True (September 8, NYC) Famed photographer Bruce Weber's tone poem on his love of dogs typically jumps all over the map to cover Dirk Bogarde, Elizabeth Taylor, and 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look for godlike beauties scat­ tered casually in the back­ ground. (Zeitgeist) Kinsey Scale: 3 Testosterone (September 10, NYC, L.A.)

(Sony Pictures Classics) Kinsey scale: 2 Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (September 17) This sci-fi adventure tale sounds like a '30s Saturday aftemoon serial, looks like an art deco reimagining of MetropOlis, and stars dreamy Jude Law and tough-but-tender Angelina Jolie as butch can-do pilot Franky. (Paramount) Kinsey Scale: 2, if only for the nifty production design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Raspberry Reich (September 24, NYC, L.A.)
