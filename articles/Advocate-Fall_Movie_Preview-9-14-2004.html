                <p>FALL ENTERTAINMENT PREVIEW Let's all go to the lobby By Michael Giltz *SEPTEMBER * A Letter to True (September 8, NYC) Famed photographer Bruce Weber's tone poem on his love of dogs typically jumps all over the map to cover Dirk Bogarde, Elizabeth Taylor, and 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look for godlike beauties scat­ tered casually in the back­ ground. (Zeitgeist) Kinsey Scale: 3 Testosterone (September 10, NYC, L.A.) Antonio Sabato Jr. is the object of David Sutcliffe's desire in this gay film noir directed by David Moreton (Edge of Seventeen), who coadapted James Robert Baker's novel with frequent Advocate contributor Dennis Going for the jug-ular: Selma Blair is Ursula Udders in A Dirty Shame, Hensley.

(Sony Pictures Classics) Kinsey scale: 2 Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (September 17) This sci-fi adventure tale sounds like a '30s Saturday aftemoon serial, looks like an art deco reimagining of MetropOlis, and stars dreamy Jude Law and tough-but-tender Angelina Jolie as butch can-do pilot Franky. (Paramount) Kinsey Scale: 2, if only for the nifty production design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Raspberry Reich (September 24, NYC, L.A.)
