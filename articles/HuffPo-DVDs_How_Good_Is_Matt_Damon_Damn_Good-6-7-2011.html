.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a very funny movie but Damon's gifts as a comic haven't been fully exploited yet (despite his amusing work on 30 Rock ), any more than his ability to be a romantic lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presumably that just doesn't interest him since he's barely assayed such a common, almost inevitable role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Politics interests him more, from the complex Syriana to T he Green Zone to his work as the narrator of the best documentary of 2010, Inside Job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Damon's talent is that he's only seemed to scratch the surface of what he's capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The older he gets, the more interesting and varied the roles he should be ableto tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Damon's never been trapped by leading man status but growing more mature will only play into The Twitter Typo That Exposed Weiner Engadget: WWDC 2011 liveblog: Steve Jobs talks iOS 5, OS X Lion, iCloud and more!

and the like -- make this a deluxe edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All you really want is the movie turned up loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANOTHER YEAR ($36.98 BluRay; Sony Pcitures Classics) -- A heartbreaking look at a single woman entering middle age who realizes her friends -- heck, even her friends' children -- have lives and lovers while she is alone and apparently will be for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A gem from director Mike Leigh and oneof the best movies of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A CLOCKWORK ORANGE ($34.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- It's no revelation,but watching this disturbing drama again, I was struck by director Stanley Kubrick's remarkable eye and how he makes scene after scene come alive with fresh and unexpected visual approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of substantial extrasinclude career retrospectives of both Kubrick and his star Malcolm McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CARANCHO ($27.99; Strand) -- This political thriller from Argentina tells the story of an ambulance chasing attorney who falls hard for a young female doctor who works the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They find the courage to put themselves in harms way and challenge the corruption all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An unappreciatedcorker that shows how dangerous true love can be -- it makes you ashamed of behaving poorly in yourlover's eyes when compromise is so much safer and easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPECTACLE -- ELVIS COSTELLO WITH...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEASON TWO ($39.95 BluRay or $29.95 regular DVD; MVD) -- Costello's very enjoyable music and chat series (where artists sit together on stage and swap stories and songs) had a very good season two with Bono, Ron Sexsmith, Bruce Springsteen, SherylCrow, Richard Thompson and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of bonus material but none of it changes the fact that thehighpoint was Jesse Winchester's instant classic performance of "Sham-A-Ling-Dong-Ding," one of theloveliest tunes you'll ever hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUCK SOUP ($19.98; Universal) -- The Marx Brothers are one of movie's greatest pleasures and their string of "animal" pictures ( Horse Feathers, Monkey Business, Animal Crackers, Duck Soup plus The Cocoanuts in this reissue) are considered their screen peak with Duck Soup the peakiest of the peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's delirious fun, though the prints are nothing special and the extras non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you already own them, don't bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't already own them, bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE KIDS IN THE HALL: COMPLETE SERIES ($99.95; A&amp;E) -- Frankly, not that many groups even get a chance to do sketch comedy on TV, so i suppose they all have their adherents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dave Foley had the best solo success ( NewsRadio ) but these five Canadians will be remembered for their work here, which always maintained a sweetness at its core that most other sketch comedy troupes lacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You getall five original seasons plus the reunion Death Comes To Town, some 800 sketches on 22 DVDs and a raft of memorable characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ranks alongside SCTV as indispensable comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does notobligate him in any way to speak positively about their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 11 One-armed guitarist impresses Bon Jovi Ice Loves Coco Stars Keepit Real Laurence FishburneLeaving CSI MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.comLeAnn Rimes: I'm in theHealthiest Place of My Life READ MORE Clooney's Girl, ElisabettaCanalis: 'I Will Be Married' Zach Galifianakis Slams Sean Penn, Ke$ha, LittleKids Kim K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopes to Be Pregnant 'by End of Year' Jennifer Love Hewitt: Worst Actress In Hollywood?
