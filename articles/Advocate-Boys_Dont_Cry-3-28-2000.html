'~ . .:'::.::;'.'.:'.:.,.~ ":':"';";-~"~ '&gt;".:.: ..... . -d * W {DOL JEG-lle boys don't cry edged it," she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though she and Swank were the only two to get a nod for the film, Sevigny counts their nomiÂ­ nations as recognition for directorÂ­ cowriter Kimberly Peirce: "Us getting nominated is Kimberly getting nominatÂ­ ed because she's speaking through us." Like everyone else connected with Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny has seen how powerfully and personally people reÂ­ spond to !he movie. "So many people, it's unbelievable," she says when asked if people come up to her to talk about it. "Especially in Hollywood-I think lives. "I've experienced that with Kids, too," she says. "The first time anybody ever approached me was a young gay boy who'd been infected with HIV, and he was crying and hugging me on the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was so overwhelmed by that. ' Since then she's delivered strong performances in Trees Lounge, The Last Days of Disco, and A Map of the World, among other films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And from the very start of her career she's been following the attempts to tell Brandon Teena's story. "I lmew if anybody ever made it into a movie, it would be fOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C&gt; TWENTIETH CENTURY fOX fiLM CORP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ILL RISHTS RESERVEO "Her love for him was so strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was unconditional, once she got over her denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it was the first time she was in love, and it didn't matter to her whether he was a boyar girl" people are more apt to approach acÂ­ tors there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here in Germany too because the movie was just released here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everywhere I turn, people come up and say what a beautiful story they thought it was and how happy they are it was made." It's also a sweet reward for Sevigny, who has emphatically not been chasing success in the Hollywood mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She chose to make her film debut in 1995's tough, controversial Kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing an HIV-positive teen searching for the boy who infected her, she established herÂ­ self right away as an actor with a talent for conveying hard realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And long before Boys Don't Cry, she learned how deeply film performances can affect real something very special," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the years it took Peirce to bring Boys Don't Cry to the screen, the emergence of the documentary feature The Brandon Teena Story [see page 49J-and of competing narrative proÂ­ jects, including a high-profile version that was to star Drew BarrymoreÂ­ might have shaken Sevigny's faith that Boys would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she stood by the project the same way she feels Lana stood by Brandon. "Her love for him was so strong, ' says Sevigny. "It was unconditional, once she got over her denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it was the first time she was in love, and it didn't matter to her whether he was a boy or girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was just so inspiring to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brandon was the first person to encourÂ­ age her to get out of town and say posiÂ­ tive things about her." Now everyone is saying positive things about Sevigny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doing nonstop press for the European premiere of American Psycho, in which she costars, the 24-year-old actress hasn't even had a chance to celebrate, much less contemÂ­ plate the sudden leap forward her career has taken. "No, it hasn't really sunk in yet at all," Sevigny says of her Best SupÂ­ porting Actress nomination .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think it will until I get to the red carpet on the evening of" Actually, the reality may sink in a lot sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Getting a nomination means enÂ­ during a constant barrage of press interÂ­ views, glad-handing, and pressure--just the sort of thing the New York-based Sevigny (who lives in Connecticut, just outside the city) has always avoided. "It's a little intense," she says, adding in a whisper, "I have to be positive in the press about it or else Kimberly will get mad at me." She laughs, quickly making it clear she's happy about the hoopla around a movie and a character she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it is intense. "They want you to do this whole campaigning thing," SeviÂ­ gny says, "going on talk shows and morning shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't like to see actors I admire on talk shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sort of ruins the mystique for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Penn talking about Bukowski on Charlie Rose makes me kind of 'Uh-h-h .. .' Everybody says you have to take advantage of this opÂ­ portunity; it's the opportunity of a lifeÂ­ time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I'm going to have to swallow my pride a little." Having starred as a traditionally femiÂ­ nine woman in Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny crosses to the other side of the queer spectrum this month in a segment of HBO's If These Walls Could Talk 2, a trilogy of shorts about lesbian lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a white T-shirt with short hair slicked back, Sevigny romances Michelle Williams of Dawson's Creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always critical of her own work and leery of seeing the finished project, Sevigny laughingly agonizes over her lesbian fans' reactions. nOh, God," she says. "I try to playa butch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm so scared they're all going to turn on me and hate me for a bad representation." She needn't worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as she did with Lana, Sevigny gets the shyness-and the sexuality-just right. -Michael Giltz Oscar nominee Hilary Swank,found that she couldn't leave .' .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brandon Teena behind once Boys Don't Cry was done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's now an; outspoken advocate for transgendered youth BY MICHAEL GILTZ the ollyvvoo tss- boys don't cry aware, then we're probably not doing something right." Swank's career has been set on fire by Boys Don't Cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The blaze of critical acclaim began in the fall, conÂ­ tinued through a near-sweep of year-end critics' prizes, and culminated in a Golden Globe win; now she's the front-runner for the Best Actress Academy Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's the attention Swank has received from ordinary peoÂ­ ple that means the most to her. 'This movie spoke to [transgendered youth] in a way that a movie hadn't yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They finally fOlllld someone they could relate to, and that feels so good To think we as a society treat them differently or not as equals is one of the most tenible things about the human experience." "When people stop me, they touch me on the shoulder, they come up really close to me and look into my eyes very intimately, and they feel like they know me," says the 25-year-old, sitting in her New York City apartment snuggling with her pet bunny, cat, and dog as her parrot looks on. "They want to go into a deeper place and say, 'This movie moved me because of this or that' or 'I have someone in my family who has the same situation' or 'You know what, I'm not gay and I'm not transgendered, but I can totally relate to Brandon.' So I stand there and I have a conversation with someone I don't know for half an hour because we both shared the same experience. n Swank also found a way to share experiences with young people facing some of what Brandon went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a representative of New York's Hetrick-Martin InstiÂ­ tute called and explained the organization's programsÂ­ such as the Harvey Milk School for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered students, and outreach to other service organizations to educate them about GLBT youth-Swank quickly agreed to pay her own way to New York and emcee the institute's annual awards dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, she couldn't head to Los Angeles the next day without meeting the youths. "They loved her," says Vema Eggleston, the executive director of Hetrick-MarÂ­ tin, which is celebrating its 20th year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eggleston vividly remembers Swank's being moved by the story of one stuÂ­ dent having a gender-identity crisis: Biologically a girl, she was dressed and treated as a boy by parents for reaÂ­ sons she never understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the boys' locker room, other students even grabbed her and held a knife to her, demanding to see her genitals-the same way Brandon was attacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swank was so touched by talking to all the youths that she changed her flight to stay longer. "This movie spoke to them in a way that a movie hadn't yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They finally found someone they could relate to, and that feels so good," Swank says. "To think we as a sociÂ­ ety ... " She struggles to convey how strongly she feels. "To treat [such young people) differently or not as equals is one of the most terrible things about the human experience." Wanting to do more, Swank returned to Hetrick-MarÂ­ tin, this time with MTV in tow, to let the rest of the counÂ­ try in on the work that the institute does. "They are so fantastic, such amazing kids," she says. "Just to see them and meet them and to see them growing and finding themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard enough to go through life as a straight kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember being a teenager, and they were such hard years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To think of all the torment I got for not wearing the right pants or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then to imagine what they go through-it's so unfair." It's all been an important lesson in hun1an differences, Swank notes. "If we were all the same, dressing the same, looking the same, thinking the same, the same reliÂ­ gion, the same race-I know exactly what would happen: It would be so boring, so dull, it would be so bland we'd just pray for diversity." â€¢ Giltz also contributes to Entertainment Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JaJ For more about New York's HetrickÂ·Martin Institute, Hilary Swank. and Â£/()ys Don't Cry, -U go to www.adyocate.com THE ADVOCATE 1381 MARCH 28. 2000</p>
