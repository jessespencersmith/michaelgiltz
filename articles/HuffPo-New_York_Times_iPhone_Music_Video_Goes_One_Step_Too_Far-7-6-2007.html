(The finaleshows Pogue in an office where co-workers realize he has an actual iPhone in his possession andchase after him like a frenzied mob.) Now Pogue has blurred the line even more and taken the New York Times with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His newest video is " iPhone: The Musical ," a goofy tribute to the phone set to the tune of "My Way." (Not "I'll Do It My Way" as Pogue, who has worked on Broadway, erroneously refers to it.)It's a silly piece showing Pogue throwing his old cell phone into the water and even getting people in line at the Apple Store in Manhattan to join in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could say it has "balance" since Poguementions some of the phone's drawbacks, including a pointed dig at AT&amp;T (lyrics here ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But essentially it's nothing more than a glorified ad Apple would be delighted to post on theirwebsite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Pogue were a kid in Oklahoma who put this video on YouTube, I'd say he was clever.But he's not a kid in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a reporter for the New York Times .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not only is the New York Times devoting time and money (and their reputation) into producing comic bits, they're doing so in service of promoting a product from another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're desperate -- like all newspapers -- to figure out how to make money out of their website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Original content like this -- however divorced from their mission as the paper of record -- is one way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what if it devalues the Times as a news outlet and turns it into a cheerleader for Apple? The video could air on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And who wouldn't want that sort of cachet? Of course the danger is that Pogue could also be hired away by The Daily Show , but that's a risk you have to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Up next week: a New York Times online sitcom dreamed up by the sports department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guess they'll have to close that bureau in Hong Kong to pay for it, but tough times call for tough choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Media...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Bikini Bathing Suits Get Great Bikinis Here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top Bikini Suppliers, Visit Today! www.teenyweenybikinis.com Comments for this entry are currently under maintenance but will be restored soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...
