(I'd like to think the year was 1999 when he delivered Time Regained but I can't swear to it.) Waves of laughter greeted this spontaneous prayer and "Raul!" soon became an enduring catchphrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annoyed by the hypesurrounding Malick (people who merely saw the trailer began insisting The Tree of Life would be his masterpicece), my friends had a more belligerent air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whaddaya got, they were saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally, succinctly, one said quietly to us as the lights went down, "Bring it, b***h!" Well, Malick did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE TREE OF LIFE **** out of **** It's brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's get that out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like director Terrence Malick, rest assured his new film fits in snugly alongside B adlands, Days Of Heaven, The Thin Red Line and The New World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It features extensive voice-overs musing on the nature of life, stunning images that convey a wealth of emotion and a surprisingly detailed storyline conveyed almost entirely without conventional narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're not a fan, this certainly won't win you over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you've never seen a Malick film in the movie theater, this look at growing up in Waco, Texas in the 1950s may be the perfect entry point when it opens on May 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not to say the movie isn't polarizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It looks certain to be the most hotly debated film of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No film buff can afford to miss it, and I can't wait to see it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To read the full review, go here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HORS SATAN/OUTSIDE SATAN ** out of **** Writer-director Bruno Dumont's latest film is a typically flat, affectless work in which you spend much of the film puzzling out exactly who is who and what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, I found it a tad more plot-driven than most of his films and thus more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, I'm a sucker for itinerant preachers and thelike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Guy (David Dewaele) is certainly saintly, quietly dropping to his knees in prayer at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives outdoors in a rural area of France, depending on The Girl (Alexandra Lamatre) for food and friendship, though he's not one much for talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he takes a shotgun and kills her stepfather, wequickly realize she was being sexually molested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even her mother begs the Girl for forgiveness since shedidn't step in and put a stop to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Things get more puzzling when a local woman begs The Guy to see hercatatonic daughter whom the doctors can't help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turns out he's a Sin Eater of some sort, sucking out thegirl's demons and taking the burden upon himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This almost makes Hors Satan an action film by the standard of Dumont's movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Things get terribly murky in the third act when Dumont loses the threadof his story completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everything we think we know about the Guy, the Girl and his special talents isconfounded in an uninteresting and messy manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the two leads are strong, the visuals typicallystriking and for a while at least the plot was unexpectedly penetrable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SNOWTOWN ** out of **** Many people had a problem with the film Michael , which meticulously showed a pedophile on his daily routine while a boy is trapped in his basement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the point, they said?

(Jamie is played by Lucas Pittaway and John by Daniel Henshall -- both are very good and the central real reason to see the film.) John begins by harassing the pedophile untilthe guy moves away but soon escalates to beheading junkies, torturing and killing others and turning onanyone who might spill the beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a relentlessly dour experience, I must say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The good performancesand solid tech work all around can't turn it into an edifying one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's the point?
