                <p>Thursday, November 14, 2019  NON-FICTION The Root of All Evil ‘The Finance Curse: How Global Finance is Making Us All Poorer’  November 13, 2019 Michael Giltz We’re in the midst of a bull market when it comes to books on inequality, the ills of Wall Street, tax justice and how to fix the whole damn mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though well-intentioned, many of these books have flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some are too geeky–Thomas Piketty, we’re looking at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some are so overwhelmed by the sheer number of financial crimes to choose from their litany of abuses becomes a blur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Finance Curse gets it just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Journalist Nick Shaxson has written for The Guardian and works with the Tax Justice Network .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here he provides a sharp history of finance and the many storied criminals of the past, among them robber barons like Rockefeller and his ilk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Shaxson smoothly and lucidly dives into a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of global finance and how it’s swallowing up the world economy.At the heart of his story? Not Wall Street, but London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The British Empire led to its second empire of inherently criminal tax havens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that led to the Bill Clinton/Tony Blair Third Way of neo-liberalism to Ireland’s paper Celtic Tiger right up to the rapacious hedge funds and private equity firms of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If none of that means much to you, it will after you read this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it’s familiar to you, Shaxson is a treat to watch tie it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone raging against the system from the left or the right should find common groundright here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, The Finance Curse is a righteous cri du coeur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it avoids the frat-boy trash talk of Matt Taibbi and the blinkered timidity of those on the right afeared of being called anti-capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading it, my inchoate understanding that the rules are rigged and the bad guys are breaking them anyway because they’re such bastards became more grounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shaxson makes a meal of neo-liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He feasts on the flimsy idea that countries must “compete” by deregulating before the country next door deregulates and wins a race to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He continues to gorge,showing how the horrific bloat of finance makes the global economy more dangerously unstable than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For dessert, Shaxson savors in reversing the idea of takers and makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, he demonstrates that the biggest “takers” of all are not the working class and poor who struggle to survive on a minimum wage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyare, in fact, the Wall Street fat cats who extract wealth everywhere they prowl.← The End of ‘The Affair’ The Five Best Irish Mob Movies →Two of his points loom large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, Wall Street is far from alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; London’s financial district and its worldwide empire of illegitimate tax havens are equally if not more to blame for the dangerous ills of the world economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second, he underlines the sheer criminality of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We tend to think of the financial industry and the one percent as above the law, people who can bend it to their whims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They rig the rules and yet the rules don’t quiteapply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet they still break the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don’t just arrange for loopholes and “legally” avoid taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wealthy and multi-national corporations commit crimes again and again, every day, all over the world.That’s good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because we can catch criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, despite Shaxson’s meticulous reporting I must regretfully point out a substantial fact error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It appears on the cover of the book, for Pete’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The subtitle of The Finance Curse is “How Global Finance Is Making UsAll Poorer.” Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not ALL of us are becoming poorer because of global finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just 99 percent of us.
