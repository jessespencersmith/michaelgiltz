"Who is that?" I wondered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read this book and you'll understandwho she is and why she won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexievich is a pioneering combination of oral historian a la Studs Terkel, journalist and literary writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've seen a steady stream of her recent works come out in English and now her breakthrough book has been translated with care by the superstar team of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It tells the story of WW IIalmost entirely from the point of view of the Soviet women who served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They served as nurses and snipers, foot soldiers andShare This Book About The Author Svetlana Alexievich, Richard Pevear, Larissa Volokhonsky MoreSvetlana Alexievich was born in Ivano- Frankivsk, Ukraine, in 1948 and has spent most of her life in the Soviet Union and present-day Belarus, with prolonged periodsof exile in Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starting out as ajournalist, she developed her own nonfictiongenre, which gathers a chorus of voices … Release Info List Price: $30.00 (Hardcover) Published: July 25, 2017 Publisher: Random House Pages: 384 ISBN 10: 0399588728 ISBN 13: 9780399588723cooks, doctors and gunners, anti-mine sweepers and pilots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They fought alongside tank units and in the cavalry, on foot and in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexievich has no interest in grand strategy or who took which hill with what flanking maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She documents everyday reality, the telling minor detail, the smell and taste of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that the women who were so vital in fighting were willfully silenced almost the second the war ended makes their desire to be heard all the more palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book is indeed literature and history and journalism of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also compulsively readable and gripping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One girlmentions she was so young when she headed to the front that she actually grew during the war. (Four inches!) Othersdescribe the absurdity of wearing size ten boots because no one ever thought to make them small enough for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One girl didn't know from saluting and when two officers walked by she dropped what she was carrying and saluted with both hands, one for each officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, women describe begging and pleading and demanding to serve at the front.These tales arrive early on as Alexievich arranges a symphony of voices, pausing for extended tales and then bringing in thechorus again, moving from the amusing to the serious, taking in war with all its horror, not to mention the Stalinist purges,the ardent belief in communism, the whispered prayers of people who maintained their faith and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stories are so heartbreaking, so funny, so sad and striking that no novelist would dare imagine the events that tumble out here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You will smile or cry or shudder or be deeply moved on virtually every page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not even a slight exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is amasterpiece of reportage akin to the documentary film "Shoah" and I can offer no higher praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By adding on witness afterwitness and story after story and fact after fact, Alexievich has created a work of enduring importance. -- Michael Giltz What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
