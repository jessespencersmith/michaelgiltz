Because I wouldn't have liked Lenesha's solid performances less if I heard shehad grown up in the Hamptons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the less I hear about people's wrenching backgrounds andpersonal growth in the face of adversity the more I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's not Idol .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Especially until we get to the final 12, the Idol episodes aren't edited to highlight the singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're edited tohighlight the stories. 72 people began the day and were grouped into four rooms -- with three rooms going forward and one being sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or as Ryan cruelly put it, sent back to "their everyday lives." It's almost impossible to judge them fairly because we virtually never saw a complete performance and moreoften than not it was a medley of different people forgetting their lyrics or doing well or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Lambert -- sang Cher's "Believe." It could have been a bold choice but it definitely came across as cabaret to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The way he sang it just made the song sound gay, in the bad sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matt Giraud -- played piano and nailed "Georgia On My Mind."

Then loads of people we barely know led by one we know too well: Tatiana Del Toro, who is shown giving a terrible performance, a relief since it means she'll be going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's followed by Alexis Grace, Kenny Hoffpauer, Jasmine Murray and Nathaniel Marhsall, none of which stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joanna Pacitti -- friend of the producers who has already had her songs placed on numerous TV shows, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pacitti had a record deal that went nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now she has a second chance and to prove how stressful Idol can be, she blows it completely by mumbling her lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Followed by a montageof other train wreck performancs by Casey Carlson, Stephen Fowler and Nick Mitchell aka Normanwho jokes his way through another song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is this Idol or Mad TV? Anna Marie Boskovich -- the latest of many to trudge through "I Hope You Dance." Ju'not Joyner -- who already has a cool spelling of his name to go with stardom, does a good take on "Hey There Delilah."Kaylan Loyd -- Simon ended her song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kai Kalama -- lost his voice Michael Sarver -- oil rigger who sounded so-so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now imagine being in the room with Tatiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if you think being with her is a good sign because she's so annoying you might imagine she'll get through for another day (though thecontestants won't know how much airtime she'd get for weeks), still...very annoying to sit with herin a corner, all alone, holding court with herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why did we watch tonight? Did anything make sense? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tatiana and Nick Mitchell got through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As did Joanna Pacitti who completely forgot her lyrics, the one unforgivablesin of Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it was done just to goose ratings -- there's certainly no vocal reason some of thesepeople got through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But before we yell and scream, remember that it's meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More peoplewill be cut tomorrow and then the final 36 will be cut down to the final 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THAT'S when it starts tomatter who makes it and not a minute before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But still, Tatiana?
