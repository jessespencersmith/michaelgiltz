Things turn dark when Seddy keeps a charm that Beau loses, a powerful talisman that contains his dreams and helps him toperform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beau loses his mojo and Seddy starts to get stronger and more forceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, her friends struggle with their own desires including an ailing sister and a dream of opening a BBQ joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the songs in the show come out naturally as performances in a club or the casual singing among friends and are serviceable to good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strongest factor is the easy camaraderie among the cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You quickly accept that these three women are old friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act Two could use more focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The women bickerfrom the start and it's not as clear as it should be that the bickering from act one has turned into bitterness and a potentially irrevocable split in act two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We should feel more strongly that the amulet is poisoning everything in their lives. but the book by Leslie Kramer already has a great deal of heart and humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the songs by her and Gabriel Gordon offer the core of a solid score in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The direction by Julie Kramer is brisk andefficient, surely a major reason why the show feels so whole even at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casting helps a great deal, with Thomas and Monroe very strong and Jones appealing even as he becomes weaker and weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tiffany Thompson does well in the dual role of a battling neighbor and an uptown blues singer.Thompson delivers her tune with just enough smoothness to convince she's a success but leaving enoughroom for grit from our heroine to establish who the real deal really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a generous choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beauty is a delight throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even when she's not speaking, you can focus on her face and now exactly what Seddy is thinking and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She mines the humor of the script and the darkness, without ever tipping into broad brushstrokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And an unexpectedly subtle finale gives the show an emotional heft that an easier, more feel-good ending would have lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good fun right now, but Pearl'sGone Blue has a lot of potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PIGPEN PRESENTS: THE MOUNTAIN SONG *** 1/2 out of **** If the Avett Brothers branched out into theater, you might expect them to deliver the tunes that pepperthe folk/country/Americana score of The Mountain Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The theater company PigPen became the first troupe in history to win the overall excellence award at FringeFest two years in a row with this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no wonder, it's a one hour delight brimming with a talented cast, delightful puppetry, a sweet but sad tale delivered at just the right length and with charm to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even before the show begins you know you're in for a good time because the entire troupe is onstage diving into one rousing instrumental after another while the audience claps along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've won us over even before the curtain rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then comes a tall tale about a father raising a mute daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hereluctantly sends her off to the big sister to learn to talk with her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sends word years later that she's getting married but the details are muddled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the father goes on a quest down the three different rivers that lead from their mountain home (his only clue is that it's taking place at the end of a river) totry and find his daughter and celebrate her happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This story is told through song and puppetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The title credits appear as clouds floating behind an illuminated screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The daughter is seen as simply a tiny dress that one cast member manipulates.

The biggest man in the world is a giant foam head held up by yet another cast member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And on and on, from a piece of folding cloth to mimic a bird to a wooden platform turning from a raft into a flying machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is all delivered with ease and pleasure by the cast, all of whom are onstage for most of the show singing songs, playing instruments and diving in to turn a prop into a character at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You smile from start to finish, even as the story gets a little sad, as stories sometimes do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It never hurts thatthe all-male PigPen players are cute as a button, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You want to buy their CD if they had one (the songs are that good) and friend them on Facebook all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book could use a little tightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the avuncular narrator Ben Ferguson holds the stage well as a performer, handling the bulk of the show's narrative drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his voice might be the weakest of thebunch; he'd shine more on "The Mountain Song" if that were his main solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But everyone from MattNuernberger as the dad on down handles the stage with the ease of people who belong there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PigPen is definitely a six-man company (recent grads from Carnegie-Mellon) to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are remounting last year's success The Nightmare Story in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And next year they'll be bringing an all new show to Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I for one won't want to miss any of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Follies *** 1/2 Hair *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 One Arm *** The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Silence!
