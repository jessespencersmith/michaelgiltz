Nice dance moves but not a great vocal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think five ofthe performances this week would make stronger singles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in defense of last season's finalists:Blake's album is easily one of the best reviewed debut albums by an Idol alum (only Carrie Underwood's blockbuster was received better).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while people dismissed Jordin Sparks as justteen fluff, who's that I see with two hit singles at the moment ("Tattoo" and "No Air" with ChrisBrown)? Yep, Jordin Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook, David Archuleta and Jason Castro all took seats in the Top 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does this, I wonder, track with the number of votes they got? I wouldn't be surprised if they were this week's top threevote getters among the men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the gals, Brooke White (singer-songwriter, Brooke; think "singer-songwriter!") and my crush Syesha Mercado made it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find it hard to believe Syesha wasin the top two of vote getters but I'd like to think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They gave each other a half-hearted hug.Brooke is all sweetness and light but I think she's gunning for the finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke don't messaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kady Malloy -- Nodding her head because she knew she was going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My first pick and I was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asia'h Epperson burst into tears even before Kady gave a dreadful, off-key rendition of Queen's "Who Wants To Live Forever." No final insult from thejudges, which was nice, though someone could have said, "You're an entertainer; not a singer." Take acting lessons, try out for sketch shows, Kady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agroup hug from the gals at the end, which did NOT include Brooke or Syesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, once you're inthe Top 12 you do not want to give up that seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hernandez must have been nervous since the first gal was eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But David sported military tags (a leftover from his days as an adult entertainer, one couldn't help wondering?) andsailed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Johns also made it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I should have been smarter and realized he was safe:when all three judges anoint you as going through to the next round, it's very very rare that Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(And Middle America loves country; I was wrong by the way -- listening to the song again she gave it more than a little twang than I firstthought).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan said, "I'm going to give you the choice" again when it came time for her to sing.Ryan, they always have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What are you going to do? Kick her off the show if she refuses?She did a fine job with Paula yelling out that it was her best vocal yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny and Chikezie clappeddutifully along though they looked like they were at a funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny v.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chikezie -- Chikezie took Danny's hand and held it as they walked to the center of the stage and then put his arm around Danny while Ryan spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramiele is crying because Dannylooks upset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Chikezie nodded his head because he just knew he was the one going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedoes this every time and every time he's safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chikezie has to start believing in himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny issent home and now he starts crying and Ramiele is crying and he and Chikezie have a big long hugand Chikezie doesn't seem to want to let go and his parents are seen giving thanks to God for hiswin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny was totally bummed about not making it because he knows getting into the Top 12means the tour and immortality of a sort that just missing the Top 12 does NOT get you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd felt hereached a tipping point of campiness with "Tainted Love" but wanted to believe one of the mostentertaining contestants had another week or two in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is America ready for an openly gay Idol ? He gave a stronger vocal performance tonight, with David Hernandez clapping and pumping his fists and dancing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good to see scandal hasn't inhibited him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Kady Malloy and Asia'h Epperson and Luke Menard and Danny Noriega are going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I got three of four right (I picked Michael Johns to go instead of Danny) so maybe I'm finally starting to hit my stride a la Brooke White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope I haven't peaked too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are you happy with the final 12and is David Archuleta still the moppet to beat or has HE peaked too soon?

I'd gladly write about everythingfor free online but then I'd be even poorer than I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spent almost two years bloggingabout entertainment and had to cut the cord because my actual paying freelance work wasdrying up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've watched New Amsterdam and like the guy and all the old NYC trivia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUt themysteries are lame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They threw in everything but the kitchen sink on the second episode: areveal of Amsterdam's son (which I loved) but then spoiling it by revealing a daughter in a flashback, and a mystery that included auto-erotic asphyxiation and the date rape drug and drug dealing AND sleeping with a teacher AND murdering a student AND murdering ahusband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's left for next week?

I was really shocked Danny got eliminated, too bad, he was pretty campy but at least he has a personality (unlike David A, who I like, but just too rehearsed!) and he could do some witty reparteewith Simon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glad Chizikie made it thru now, maybe he can relax a little and really show his stuff.And I gotta say David C has gone to the top of my list as favorites, loved his version of Hello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bought iton Itunes and I even hum it at work! I hope he can give a stern challenge to the favorite, David A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Letshave an adult win AI this year!Plus also really glad David H got thru, he's a great singer and apparently most people agreed with methat the stripper affair was a big "so what?" johntal See Profile I'm a Fan of johntal permalink at LEAST that light-weight fem-bot Danny is finally off-the young female population could not relate to"Tainted Love" and with David in ; the gay pop can have a "MAN" in there for them! One blonde is stillin ,tho I 'm not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I do not mean Brooke ) Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I don't think Danny was a contender but I did appreciate that he didn't try to butch himself upor pretend to be someone he's not -- and his repartee with Simon and Ryan and the rest wasdef a highlight the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Idol American Idol Finalists American Idol RecapStyle : Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Style : Verena von Pfetten 7 Lessons To Be Learned From Carla Bruni Style : Verena von Pfetten Brow-O-Wow: Bushy Eyebrows Make AComeback (PHOTOS, POLL) Related Tags Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:50 AM on 03/08/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:07 AM on 03/07/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:04 AM on 03/07/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:17 AM on 03/07/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:33 PM on 03/07/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 16: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_90342.html [4/5/2009 7:29:49 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Idol Kris Allen Watch Kris Allen's Latest Idol Performance w/ Free Videos Toolbar Videos.alottoolbars.com</p>
