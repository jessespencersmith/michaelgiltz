                <p>MOVIES TV COMICS GAMES Martin Freeman (Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)Martin Freeman: ‘The Hobbit’ finds its Bilbo Baggins Oct. 22, 2010 | 3:35 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let’s hope actor Martin Freeman is prepared to attend Comic-Con for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the news that Freeman has snagged the role of Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s two-part adaptation of “ The Hobbit ,” the 39-year- old has earned himself a standing invite to any and all fantasy-fanconventions this side of Middle Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than the Bilbo role, too,Freeman has establishedfanboy cred with hiswork in “ The Hitchhiker’s Guideto the Galaxy ” and “Sherlock ,” the modern-day televisionreworking of ArthurConan Doyle’s iconicsleuth, which featuresFreeman in the Dr.Watson role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman’s confirmationas Bilbo has receiveduniversal praise, and rightly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He brings a charismatic frisson to the role, just as Elijah Wood did with his spot-on inhabiting of the Frodo part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just feels right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bilbo is middle- aged and set in his ways and certainly not looking for an adventure. (“Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!”) And yet he has decency and reserves of daring 3 0 77« PREVIOUS POST | NEXT POST » E-mail Print Read Later Latest MOVIES ANIME TOP 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘FullmetalAlchemist’ lead 2010 s best » TV VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’ completes the Jedi joke trilogy » COMICS Frank Miller’s Christmas wish… » GAMES Guillermo del Toro: inSANE video gamewill be ‘immersive, powerful’ Lovecraftianadventure » @LATHerocomplex ANIME TOP 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ lead 2010 s best http://lat.ms/flziIV -8 hours ago ‘Tron: Legacy’ is a heritagemoment for Steven Lisberger http://lat.ms/ic0ilN -10 hours ago VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’completes the Jedi joke trilogy http://lat.ms/gkDx2A -11 hours ago VIDEO: ‘Family Guy: It’s a Trap!’ completes the Jedi joke trilogy »Curse of the Spider-Man? Fourth accident for troubled Broadwayproduction »‘The Hunger Games’star search: ‘There are no front-runners yet’ »BLOG INDEX that prove the making of him; Freeman’s wry, everyman appeal as “ The Office” drone Tim fits that description perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Numerous other actors were announced, principally the group of dwarves that Bilbo joins in the quest of Erebor to reclaim a dragon’s hoard stolen from their people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with “ The Lord of the Rings ,” many of the parts are filled by little-known actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quick rundown: * Thorin Oakenshield , the imposing if long-winded leader of the dwarves, will be played by Richard Armitage , a regular on the UK spy series “ MI-5 .” In the upcoming “ Captain America: The First Avenger , ” Armitage plays Heinz Kruger , a Nazi spy and key early foe of the superhero.* As the cheerful young fellows Kili and Fili (the Merry and Pippin of this tale), Jackson has chosen Aidan Turner (the vampire Mitchell in U.K. series “ Being Human “) and Robert Kazinsky (the tempestuous Sean Slater of “ EastEnders “). * Graham McTavish (a Russian baddie on “ 24” and cast member on one season of sci-fi comedy “ Red Dwarf ,” appropriately enough) will play Dwalin . * John Callen (numerous voice roles, including two “ Power Rangers ” series) is Oin , rather handy at lighting fires. * Stephen Hunter (a brief turn on “ ER”-like hospital drama “ All Saints ”) has the role of the fat, sleepy, generally clueless Bombur . * Mark Hadlow (voice work in “ Meet the Feebles ” and a small role in Jackson’s “ King Kong “) is Dori , the stout dwarf who drops Bilbo in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains and loses him, thus setting up Bilbo’s meeting with Gollum and the One Ring. * Peter Hambleton (regular work on New Zealand TV, including a turn on “ The Strip ,” a series about a female lawyer who chucks it all to open a strip club!) is Gloin . * Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis return as Gandalf and Gollum .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oddly, the Hollywood Reporter suggests that the role of Elrond needs to be cast, when surely Hugo Weaving will reprise his role as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More juicy roles have yet to be officially announced, including the Goblin King ( Alan Cumming ?), the shape-shifter Beorn (sorry, Robbie Coltrane , one fantasy series is enough) and the dour Bard the Bowman .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely Jonathan Rhys Meyers would be an ideal Elf in there somewhere? Numerous names like David Tennant have been bandied about, often more out of fan frenzy than any particular knowledge about Jackson’s leanings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the biggest remaining role is the voice of the wily dragon Smaug .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Nighy has been bruited about and that seems so ideal you can’t help but imagine him bantering with Bilbo as they compete in a duel of wits. (Plus, it would be a reunion of sorts since he and Freeman bothappeared in “ Love Actually ” and Nighy played Slartibartfast in “Hitchhiker’s Guide.”) Add in Nighy’s turns in “ Shaun of the Dead ,” two of the “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” films and “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1  and it appears that he has one of those lifetime passes to Comic-Cons as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Connery would be fitting as Smaug , since he reportedly turned down the role of Gandalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet, he’s already done a dragon (remember the Dennis Quaid -starrer “DragonHeart” ?) and is all but retired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, Connery has done some voice work in recent years, so it’s not completely out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Fry (another name mentioned repeatedly for a role) would be a delicious possibility as Smaug and especially welcome to the U.K. kiddies who have grown up hearing his delightful audio book readings ofthe “Harry Potter” series.Curse of the Spider-Man?
