The film was excellent and does not need an English retelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree with you but I agree with the filmwriter --the trailer looks amazingly surprising ly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't give too much away which always indicates to me that a film sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have you read the book? I'm sorry I didn't get a chance yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are way too many people who simply will not watch a subtitled film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, I know a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least this remake seems from the trailer to be faithful to the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somany wonderful foreign films have been totally ruined in their American remakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I amfearful of what will happen to the Millennium Trilogy movies in their US incarnatio ns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wow! are you going to all those films??
