Global warming, where scientific studies andgroup after group insisted that the evidence for human impact onglobal warming was overwhelming but Bush lied anyway and said thejury was still out."Several dozen interviews with administration officials and withscientists in and out of government, along with a variety ofdocuments, show that the core of the clash is over instances in whichscientists say that objective and relevant information is ignored ordistorted in service of pre-established policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists wereessentially locked out of important internal White House debates;candidates for advisory panels were asked about their politics as wellas their scientific work; and the White House exerted broad controlover how scientific findings were to be presented in public reports ornews releases."Then there's the overt politicizing of what should be non-partisanscientific advisory panels."Despite three years of charges that it is remaking scientific andmedical advisory panels to favor the goals of industry or socialconservatives, the White House has continued to ask some panelnominees not only about their political views, but explicitly whetherthey support Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush."If Albert Einstein were still around, he'd probably be locked up inGuantanamo Bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser Logout from DisqusLogged in asusing Facebook Connect (Logout) Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's RescueRangers are Louisiana 1976, jlms qkw, shayera,dopper0189, ybruti, and srkp23 with vcmvo2editing.* ~ World order will be secured only ...7 minutes agoEschatonThe Stupids - When I was growing up what alwayspissed me off more than anything was when mysense of justice was violated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not claiming thatmy sense of such things...39 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsOpen Thread - Blog Against Theocracy, ablogswarm in favor of separation of church andstate, is this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Open Thread below.57 minutes agoHuffPost PoliticsNorman Solomon: Democrats and War Escalation -Top Democrats and many prominent supporters -with vocal agreement, tactical quibbles or totalsilence - are assisting the escalation of the U.S.war effort...1 hour agoFiredoglakeLate Nite: Michele Bachmann Stars in “Birth of anAberration” - Minnesota's wackiest export treadsthe boards of the Wingnut dinner theater.1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Next 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Bush V ...http://www.americablog.com/2004/10/bush-vs-science-science-... 1 of 64/7/09 12:33 AM</p>
