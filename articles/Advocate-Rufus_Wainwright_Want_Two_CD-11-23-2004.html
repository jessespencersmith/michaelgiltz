                <p>arts&amp;eatertainment m 0 S i e r e Everyt 'answa Want Two feels a bit like Rufus Wainwright vamping until his next album-but the enclosed concert DVD is a must for devotees of the out troubadour By Michael Giltz ""amtwo{~t)-QyqcelJ1ti() IIRufusWainwright.Dr~am .M II1II $21.95 Elton John has called Rufus Wainwright an "as-yet unherald­ ed American treasure," and one imagines Wainwright would re­ spond, with the casual confi­ dence he exudes, "Quite true." Treasure? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unheralded? His near-perfect 2003 album, Want One, was hailed by critics, hitting number 12 on The Village Voice's an­ nual Pazz &amp; Jop Critics' Poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wainwright has a small role in Martin Scorsese's Oscar hope­ ful The Aviator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And de­ spite upheavals at his record label, Wainwright has just released this CD-DVD combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's more than a collection of odds and ends from the Want sessions but less than a proper follow-up to that CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've been told it's the "weird" stuff, but since Want One was already pretty darn eccentric, that doesn't prove quite true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, the opener, "Agnus Dei," is a lovely Latin choral hymn, and the clos­ er, "An Old Whore's Diet" (a duet with Antony of Antony and the Johnsons), is an almost nine-minute wig-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But al­ most everything here would have sounded right at home on Want One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The witty "Little Sis­ ter," "The Art Teacher" (a lovely man who is the protagonist's fa­ vorite work of art), and concert favorite "Gay Messiah" are among the strongest tracks here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they didn't belong, either thematically or musically, on that earlier album, which is more up­ beat than this mellow affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wainwright knows the importance of creating an album that flows, that takes you some­ where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He produced a double album's worth of music, but Want One is stronger for not including them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Want Two is fine for fans who can't wait for his next magnum opus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What makes this truly worthwhile, however, is the concert DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has 90 minutes of Wainwright performing at THE ADVOCATE 192 I NOVEMBER 23, 2004 the Fillmore Auditorium, interspersed with brief segments of him wandering through San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's in fine form, and the show is mercifully free of frenetic editing and quick cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know Wainwright is in full con­ trol when he segues from the rousing "I Don't Know What It Is" to the quiet, wrenching "Dinner at Eight," and the crowd remains in the palm of his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His openhearted performance-so self­ dramatizing, so self-aware, so funny when it isn't moving-can't help but bring to mind another drama queen, Judy Garland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely it's only a matter of time before Wainwright's gorgeous voice tackles the standards .• Giltz is a regular contributor to several periodicals, including the New York Post.</p>
