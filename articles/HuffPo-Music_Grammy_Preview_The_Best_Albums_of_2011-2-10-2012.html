                <p>Entertainment Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Follow Grammy Awards , Video , Best Of 2011 , Grammy Award Predictions , Grammy Awards 2012 , Grammy Predictions 2012 , The Grammys , Entertainment NewsReact Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyGrammy Preview: The Best Albums of 2011 From Top to Bottom I've traveled to the future and can reassure you that Adele will have a fun night at the Grammys on Sunday.Her album is one of those inevitable triumphs at anawards show that feels right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adele has dominated thecharts and the radio and critics; if she'd been able totour, we'd probably be saying how much better hersongs sound in concert than they do on the album andrealize she has room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her smash hit 21 is in every sense the album of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I was surprised in my recent trip down South to realize how few people actually own it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five millioncopies is nothing to sneeze at in the North American market, but a lot more people should snap it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ifand when they do, here are some other albums you might want to consider purchasing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thesedays, you can check them out first on Spotify or MySpace so you won't have to take my word for it beforespending your precious entertainment dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have an embarrassing lack of classical music this year (Ijust wasn't exposed to much), but there's something for almost everyone -- pop, rock, country, jazz,gospel, world music, film scores, ambient, folk and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've liked the artist before or enjoy thegenre, I'll bet it's worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now make sure you read the list and immediately chide me for not including so and so (Wilco! Jayhawks! Tuneyards!) or for foolishly including so and so (Panic! at the Disco? Really?) or for having one act toohigh (Glen Campbell in the Top 10?) or too low (Frank Ocean at the bottom?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, it wouldn't be fun if we didn't argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm especially looking forward to getting tips about any albums I haven't heard yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chances are if an act is on a lot of year-end lists that I probably already gave it a listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But little known favorites of yours are very welcome comments indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's certainly all I hope to achieve with my picks: point you in the direction of an album or two I think you'll love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now, the list! Come back over the weekend and I promise to add in some comments explaining my choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ALBUMS OF 20111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FLEET FOXES Helplessness Blues (CSN rocks out) 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOM WAITS Bad As Me (bohemian troubadour in top form)MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (27) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA CELEBRITY TV COMEDY FOOD STYLE ARTS BOOKS LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Bobby BowdenHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 02/10/2012 5:07 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Entertainment Alerts Sign UpSPONSOR GENERATED POST Like 723 Like 9k Recommend 268 Like 62 Like 7k Like 1kThe Avengers Political Hollywood Electronic Dance Music One Direction More Log in Create Account3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KING CREOSOTE &amp; JON HOPKINS Diamond Mine (quirky concept album, gorgeously done) 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GILLIAN WELCH The Harrow and the Harvest (simple, straightforward, striking folk) 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEDDY THOMPSON Bella / kd lang Sing It Loud /RON SEXSMITH -- Long Player, Late Bloomer (pure pop by pure pros) 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WYNTON MARSALIS AND ERIC CLAPTON Play the Blues / BRANFORD MARSALIS AND JOEY CALDARAZZO Songs of Mirth and Melancholy (trad jazz) 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GLEN CAMPBELL Ghost on the Canvas (haunting country pop) 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOMBINO Agadez (Tuareg rocks!) / BOUBACAR TRAORE Mali Denhou (gentle African guitar) / LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO Songs From a Zulu Farm (ecstatic and playful children's music) 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VARIOUS ARTISTS This May Be My Last Time Singing: Raw African American Gospel on 45 RPM (1957-1982) (lo-fi, high flying gospel that's so good you'll convert) 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADELE 21 (unstoppable soul diva) *** 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROUPLOVE Never Trust a Happy Song (raucous LA pop-rock) 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PANIC!

FLEET FOXES Helplessness Blues (CSN rocks out) I really struggled with which album to put on top this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually it's simply the album I played the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this year I was just crazy about all the album in my Top 5 (and Adele at #10 certainly didn't need more promotion from me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, it was the pure sonic beauty of Fleet Foxes that sealed the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every single time I put it on I got chills and thegorgeous vocals, stirring arrangements and wave of emotions they brought out in me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are there albumsjust as good from 2011? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But none were prettier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Cultura Pop Abortion Sleep Republican Party Mashups Television News Corp Architecture MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» ricky_martin RetweetMake Room for (the New) Daddy http://t.co/Q6eIDokm via @huffingtonpost feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, manyothers including octopi, havehuman-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQh2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KING CREOSOTE &amp; JON HOPKINS Diamond Mine (quirky concept album, gorgeously done) Very few in the U.S. paid attention to this odd little album; in the U.K. it appeared on more lists but not with the fervor it deserves. it's a concept album about life in a fishing village, complete with mutteredvoices, people grabbing a bite in the local greasy spoon, various characters stepping forward to tell their story and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what a gorgeous, fragile thing of beauty this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just a little over half an hour long but the experience is so intense and enveloping, you'll feel like you've just sunk into another world and wake up slowly and reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm playing it again and feel tempted to put it on top all over again.People have heard of Fleet Foxes but this will surely be new to virtually everyone reading it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you likeRobert Wyatt (I don't know what else to compare this unique work to), jump. (Seriously, I've been writing this list while Diamond Mine plays and it's breaking my heart with the vulnerability and empathy on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simple but somehow perfect vocals with just the right sonic touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A real keeper.) 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOM WAITS Bad As Me (bohemian troubadour in top form) Just one song kept the great Waits from the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've liked so much of what he's done over the years, including the industrial strength clamor of much of his work in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here his sonics are more restrained so fans who haven't visitedWaits in a long time should dive back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is one of his strongest works in years, from the typicallyclanging opener "Chicago" (it settles down soon enough) to the heart-breaking closer "New Year's Eve,"the sort of drunken elegy Waits does so well we take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what song spoiled it ever soslightly? "Last Leaf On The Tree," a fine little ditty that simply repeats itself to distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At two minutes this slight tune would go by quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At four minutes it's a bit of a distraction given the limited melody on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep this in perspective: I was niggled by a few bars of one song on an otherwisemarvelous work that shows Waits as deeply in command as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Neil Young and Bob Dylan andother greats, time is not dimming his talent in the least.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GILLIAN WELCH The Harrow and the Harvest (simple, straightforward, striking folk) Well, if Welch is gonna make us wait years and years for a new album, at least she delivers the goods and then some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This follow-up to Soul Journey is impeccable folk-rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It could just as easily have been my Album of the Year. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TEDDY THOMPSON Bella / kd lang Sing It Loud /RON SEXSMITH -- Long Player, Late Bloomer (pure pop by pure pros) No, I'm not consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes I get annoyed when the music press genuflects in front of the latest offering from the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, et al in almost an unconscious reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, when they ignore terrific new music by established acts that aren'tat the superstar level, I want them to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe these artists simply don't have heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TeddyThompson hasn't broken through commercially despite getting better and better with every album, somaybe the press has written him off as an act that can't sell magazines. kd lang hasn't come out in awhile, so what new can you say about her? And we all know Sexsmith is an impeccable pop craftsman;didn't Elvis Costello tell us so for years? Nonetheless, all three have delivered absolutely top-notch pop albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've ever been a fan, don't hesitate for a moment.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WYNTON MARSALIS AND ERIC CLAPTON Play the Blues / BRANFORD MARSALIS AND JOEY CALDARAZZO Songs of Mirth And Melancholy (trad jazz) Surely the Marsalis brothers hate having all their work linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wynton has found new purpose and a sense of joy via collaborations with the likes of Willie Nelson and now Clapton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their jam session brings out the best in both of them.(Who knew "Layla" would prove so malleable?) And does anyone in jazz have a more gorgeous tone thatBranford? For sheer sonic beauty, it's the best since Getz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIs album is also a collaboration and it leansmore heavily on melancholy than mirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great stuff.7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GLEN CAMPBELL Ghost on the Canvas (haunting country pop) I have no strong affection for Glen Campbell and won't try and retroactively make his career more important than it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think a strong greatest hits album sums him up very well, which is hardly something to sneer at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many artistsnever get even that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So his illness and late period Cash-like recording don't tug at my heartstrings for anyreason other than the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Campbell's voice -- his greatest weapon -- isn't remotely asgood as in his heyday but now we can appreciate what a terrific singer he always was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Elvis Presley'salbum Elvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old) , this combines terrific songs with spoken word passages to spooky, marvelous effect. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOMBINO Agadez (Tuareg rocks!) / BOUBACAR TRAORE Mali Denhou (gentle African guitar) / LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO Songs From a Zulu Farm (ecstatic and playful children's music) Bombino is a guitarist par excellence, a superstar in Africa who draws on traditional sounds along with rock and blues while delivering the seemingly endless pleas for peace and hope that Africa invariablyneeds but lacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He surely acknowledges a debt to Traore, a fellow African who suffered not fromrepression but by seeming linked to oppressors and being out of favor for years because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, they can find common ground in their music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's Ladysmith Black Mambazo, an act you knowand -- if you've seen them in concert -- love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This album of children's songs they learned as kids growingup in rural South Africa is one of their lightest and most sheerly entertaining in their entire discography. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VARIOUS ARTISTS This May Be My Last Time Singing: Raw African American Gospel on 45 RPM (1957-1982) (lo-fi, high flying gospel that's so good you'll convert) This followup to the excellent compilation Fire in My Bones is another revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filled with well-known tunes and obscure songs performed generally by acts only the most devoted gospel listener has heard of (no Kirk Franklin or Mahalia here), it's a delight from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The so-so sound quality of many of these raritiesactually works to the album's benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You feel like you're listening to them via a transistor radio catchinga far-away station or maybe down the block from a house of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The performances are joyous,foreboding, ecstatic and majestic.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADELE 21 (unstoppable soul diva) A great album with a string of singles that get better and better the more you hear them -- that's about as great as pop music gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyonce and Lady Gaga had some great singles, but they couldn't come within a mile of the genuine artistic statement of this album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping Adele stays healthy vocally and unhealthy in her choice of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yep, it's Mary J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blige all overagain -- do we really want to risk Adele writing about how content she is? Don't worry; we'll be there tocomfort you. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROUPLOVE Never Trust a Happy Song (raucous L.A. pop-rock) Why this L.A. band isn't the toast of the town simply escapes me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrific stuff. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PANIC! AT THE DISCO Vices &amp; Virtues (sterling but overlooked pop-rock) Am I a sucker for pure pop? Panic! can add or drop the exclamation point as many times as they want as long as they keepcreating indelible melodies and stirring rock like they do here. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NICK LOWE The Old Magic (vintage wine, vintage bottle) I've never been deeply invested in Nick Lowe but boy is this a charmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only reason it isn't higher on my list is because I haven't listened to it enough yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This video isn't from his current album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's recent and shows Lowe in excellent form. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILD FLAG Wild Flag (giving super groups a good name) Sleater-Kinney lives in this new band composed of some of the talent from that group and their friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unruly fun.15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRAD MEHLDAU Modern Music (dependably adventurous jazz trio)/ COLIN VALLON -- Rruger (bold EU trio following in Mehldau's wake) Mehldau is consistently great so the strength of his latest is no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now his influence is seeping out to the continent, not by the obvious tactic of covering unexpected pop songs but simply in their commitment to the piano-led jazz trio. 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAY-Z AND KANYE WEST Watch the Throne (braggadocio taken to new heights) Neither is quite my cup of tea but they've delivered great works before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West's last album was the first one I truly loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Together they indulge in the usual hip-hop obnoxiousness of boasting and putting down bitches, but somehow they're in such good spirits here it kind of won me over.17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BON IVER Bon Iver (stares down success with quiet confidence) Bon Iver's intense publicity surrounding his last album didn't corner him into repeating himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This album gently expands his sonic palette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought maybe he was the flavor of the week, but who knows? He might just be in it for the long haul. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALLAKE SISSOKO AND VINCENT SEGAL Chamber Music (delicate instrumentals) I could look up all sorts of facts about who they are, where they come from, their instruments and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the simple fact is that their album is lovely. 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PAUL SIMON So Beautiful or So What (mortality, musically) I can't remember the last time I put a Paul Simon album on my best of the year last. (Probably Rhythm of the Saints. ) And I love the guy! As one of the all-time greats, I hold him to a higher standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he meets it here on this pop gem aboutfacing death with wit, resignation and some excellent melodies. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BETH HART &amp; JOE BONAMASSA Don't Explain (the blues, thumpingly good) The blues make for a stomping good time when performed with such glee. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PRESERVATION HALL JAZZ BAND AND DEL MCCOURY BAND American Legacies (an institution finds new life via collaboration) PHJB is an institution and as such, much of its best work was probably behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until 2010 when it collaborated with an all-star cast to celebrate some anniversary oranother and the band produced one of its most enjoyable albums in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of those collaboratorsproved so successful, they went and recorded an entire album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results do not disappoint.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE When the Heart Emerges Glistening (quietly probing jazz) A sterling Blue Note debut by one of jazz's best young trumpeters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A clutch of strong originals, a great young quintet, focus,vision -- this is very exciting indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a live performance from his new album, you must go to YouTube . 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAMES BLAKE James Blake (trippy pop) Not my thing usually, but Blake has enough snippets of emotion to keep me returning and every time I do it seems a little more cohesive and satisfying. 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VARIOUS ARTISTS Live From the Old Town School (folk's beating heart) Sometimes you go out to track down history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other times you can wait quietly and have it come to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chicago center of folk Old Town School has seen countless legends pass through its doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently they knew it andrecorded everyone who came to town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This 4 CD set contains a truckload of inspired performances fromTaj Mahal and Mahalia Jackson to Jeff Tweedy and Peter Case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fourth CD devoted to world musicdoesn't have quite the same impact but the overall level of quality and the mix of great and unexpectedmake this a genuine discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a performance (not from the album) by Steve Dawson at thelegendary venue.25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GIRLS Father, Son, Holy Ghost (interesting identity crisis) I loved the first album by Girls but was slightly suspicious nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now their proper followup has me even more nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each song seems to come from an entirely different band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do Girls even know what sort of sound they're going for, if any?It shouldn't work but the album holds together for me out of sheer perversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have no idea what toexpect but it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope they find more direction next time but for the moment the grab-bagapproach is working just fine. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TINARIWEN Tassili (bluesy, distinctive, campfire sing-alongs) One of the strongest acts in world music for the past few years, Tinariwen don't disappoint with their latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always picture them performing around a campfire in the middle of the desert, the flames the only light for miles around? AmI romanticizing or fetishizing them? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But their music is bluesy and distinctive enough to travelaround the globe so I'm sure it'll withstand my flight of fancy.27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JOY FORMIDABLE The Big Roar (noisy pop) A child of Nirvana, they have its gift for making an unholy racket but keeping it reined in with a very strong pop sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very good stuff. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DARI0 MARINELLI WITH JACK LIEBECK Jane Eyre soundtrack (the year's best traditional score)/ MATTHEW COOPER Some Days Are Better Than Others (the year's best untraditional score) The score for the fine remake of Jane Eyre is the best orchestral score of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't even seen the indie film Some Days Are Better Than Others , but the pop instrumental score by Matthew Cooper is so stirring and lovely it certainly makes me want to right away.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CORAL Butterfly House /THE MAGIC NUMBERS Runaway (pop, unimported, unrecognized) I kept waiting for both of these albums to be released in the U.S. but they never were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both bands are more appreciated in the U.K. than they are here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Coral live for nuggets-style garage rock while Magic Numbers savor the gorgeous vocals of Laurel Canyon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multiple tracks should be bigradio hits. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PISTOL ANNIES Pistol Annies / MIRANDA LAMBERT Four The Record (country's top gal and friends) Miranda Lambert -- the SECOND runner-up on the late, lamented (by me) talent show Nashville Star, just keeps growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her latest solo album isn't quite as good as her last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then sheturns around and forms Pistol Annies with some friends to fill the gaping hole where the Dixie Chicksused to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combine her best work on both of these album and you've got a great work indeed. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LOW ANTHEM Smart Flesh (brainy Americana) Still waiting to break through to a wider audience a la Avett Brothers and Mumford &amp; Sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That good. 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLIE HADEN AND QUARTET WEST Sophisticated Ladies (female singers, jazz swingers) A great lover of classic jazz singers pairs with some of today's best vocalists and hits some standards out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Melody Gardot, Cassandra Wilson and Diana Krall are along for the ride.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BLACK KEYS El Camino (rock, no fuss) I respected and admired and appreciated The Black Keys but never quite dug them until last week when I was walking down Fifth Avenue (one of the least Black Keys-appropriate streets in NYC) when it just clicked and I could groove on their music.Sometimes it just takes the right frame of (an open) mind. 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; M83 Hurry Up, We're Dreaming (ambient pop) Another act where I need the right setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In their case, it usually involves a late night, an open highway and the perfect number, like "Raconte, Moi Une Historie." 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALISON KRAUSS AND UNION STATION Paper Airplanes / JOHN HIATT Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns (old dogs, old tricks, happily so) Two veterans who stepped it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't appreciate the Krauss for a while because the CD came "burdened" with bonus tracks that made the CD too long and kept me from appreciating the album proper for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took my friend Sal at Burning Wood to nudge me into giving the Hiatt a second chance and realizing he's strung together one of his best sincethat miracle heyday around Bring the Family.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEASTIE BOYS Hot Sauce Committee, Part Two (feisty hip-hop from the old-timers) They've still got life in them yet. 37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEN HOWARD Every Kingdom (gentle pop)/ MIKE BLOOM King Of Circles (WARM singer- songwriter vibe for this solo debut) Two quiet works of solid tunes that get better with each listen.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VINICIUS CANTUARIA AND BILL FRISELL Lagrimas Mexicanas (two great guitars, one great voice equal haunting Latin music) A playful, delightful collaboration between the always adventurous Frisell and the Brazilian singer and instrumentalist Cantuaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really charming. 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GOURDS Old Mad Joy (rootsy celebration) / MARC BROUSSARD Marc Broussard (bluesyrock) Americana from the front porch, for then Gourds, and from the juke joint for Broussard, who has it all to be a star except the touring and radio that once upon a time would have championed him. 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUZANNE VEGA Close-Up Volume 3: State Of Being (acoustic songs, electric songwriting) Vega has been recording her catalog over again so she can own the masters to these new versions and profit from them at least a little (is that asking so much for an artist?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out of necessity has come fresh proofabout her exceptional catalog of songs and Vega's gifts as a performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After her debut, Vega quicklyproved she was no folkie, thanks to an adventurous gift for sonic experimentation and great pop sense.But here she is stripping her songs down again mainly to a voice and a guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results are gripping,mixing older and fresher tunes side by side till all you can see is the impressive breadth of her career.Plus each volume works beautifully on its own terms.41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VARIOUS ARTISTS Those Shocking, Shaking Days: Indonesia Hard, Psychedelic, Progressive Rock and Funk (1970-1978) (rock and roll knows no borders) Truly, rock and roll is everywhere and always has been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there's a better example of world music than Indonesian acts pounding out these thumping originals back in the 1970s while singing lyrics like "I like the Rolling Stones," well I don't know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there no end to the riches produced around the world we're barely aware of much less listened to? Apparently not. 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VARIOUS ARTISTS The Book of Mormon Original Cast Album (religiously funny) I believe it's more fun to see the show in person and some of the weaker comic numbers truly do need the context of the show to work best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the best numbers like "Hello," "Turn It Off" and "I Believe" are a blast to singany time. (What a great moment for Andrew Rannells on the Tonys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He and the original cast is with TheBook Of Mormon for another year so get to it if you can.) 43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRAKE Take Care (emo-rap)/ SHABAZZ PALACES Black Up Not a banner year for me and hip- hop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Drake kept compelling me to listen in to his thoughts whereas Shabazz seemed to be pushing meaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, nothing piques interest in feeling like you're not wanted.44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRAD PAISLEY This Is Country Music (yes it is) / STEVE EARLE I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive (determined, focused country) Paisley does an amazing thing on his new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first track details all the things you shouldn't do in a country song (like say the word "cancer") in a song that's wonderfully catchy and a heartland statement of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he spends the rest of the album doing asong about each and every "forbidden' scenario he mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a quiet tour de force of songwriting,delivered with Paisley's typical understated charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earle, meanwhile, just pounds 'em out with righteousfocus and energy, a modern day Woody Guthrie.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEGAFAUN Megafaun ('70s-ish rock) Dreadful name and dreadful (truly dreadful) album cover make this exceptionally quirky album look like some anonymous Boston rip-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They start boldly early on with a Seventies slice of AM radio heaven called "Get Right" that goes on for eight minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before andafter is a lot of great stuff that is anything but anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd never know it from the packaging orthat stupid name. 46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FATOUMATA DIAWARA Fatou (Malian guitar talent combined with impeccable vocals)/ KHAIRA ARBY Timbukto Traab (country to Diawara's city sound) I have no idea about the actual provenance of either act or the musical pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But to my Western ear, Diawara's music sounds uptown and sweet whereas Arby's call and response feels more downtown or rather out of town in some ruralarea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both are striking albums any fan of world music would do well to catch.47.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON PERSON So Nice (late period capper for understated jazz blower) I trust Person isn't going anywhere, but this feels like a valedictory for a journeyman player given a chance to shine one more time and delivering in spades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a recent performance in New York City featuring a standard not onhis album. 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REAL ESTATE Days -- (shimmering indie pop) Jersey lads delivering the pop goods with just a dash of fading beauty.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EILEEEN JEWELL Queen of the Minor Key (sneakily impressive) Americana with a nod to 50s rock and torch songs that grow on you. 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANK OCEAN nostalgia/ultra (backward/forward looking moody pop) A trendy, hyped act that then slipped from view for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many I'm wary of hype but each dip into the water with this album was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The really positive sign is when you return to an album months later and the first tracksounds exceptionally familiar, as if you've been playing it for weeks on end when in fact you haven'tplayed a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the sign of an album that could continue to deepen and reveal itself over time.Ocean seems like a patient artist, so we should be too in listening to his music before passing judgment.Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Williams As Dwight D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eisenhower In...

Two of the funkiest, hottest albums of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Period. 12:33 AM on 02/12/2012 A friend of mine just saw Morris Day at the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll be sure to check both out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for the tips. 10:36 PM on 02/11/2012 I don't buy a lot of new albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I download a lot of singles, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I have heard some of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been sending my friends that Bombino video for months now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He totally jams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MC in the hat is classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same thing goes for Tinariwen's "Tenere Taqhim Tossam." Truly amazing song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd urge everyone to listen to those two songs and everything else from these two acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Old Mad Joy continued my slight disappointment in recent Gourds efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's one of their weaker albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm still waiting for them to regain that rare form on their earlier albums and Cow Fish FowlOr Pig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd have settled for something as good as Heavy Ornamentals, but instead got another Haymaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most this is too, ah, soft for my tastes. "El Camino" is one of the harder albums on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other harder stuff that kicks bootie include Chevelle's "Hats Off To The Bull," In Flame's "Sounds ofa Playground Fading," and Red Fang's "Murder the Mountains." I miss good hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loved Damian Marley and Nas' effort Distant Relatives in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anybody know of anything that quality out since then? I'd like to try it. 12:35 AM on 02/12/2012 I know, I know, my music is def softer, but I've always favored melody over rhythm, even as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's not me getting old, just me being a fuddy duddy at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm late to theGourd, so don't feel the same disappointment that you and others express.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not avintage year for hip-hop so hopefully someone will offer some good suggestions for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting.Permalink | Share it Rmuntz Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Lateef Murdock Liberal, because it's the Christian way .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it niko73 Dem belly full but we hungry Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it0 Fans 117 Fans 127 Fans 220 Fans 127 FansThis user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program 06:35 PM on 02/11/2012 the grammys are a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of giving the awards to the "artists" they should give them to the publicists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are the opposite of the oscars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The oscars award artistic merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grammys are just a popularity contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is all you need to know about the grammys: Brittany Spears has been nominated 8 times(she won once).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would be like academy awards going to Snakes on a Plane. 06:29 PM on 02/11/2012 I would also like to add here that Tinariwen has been nominated for a Grammy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's too bad they cannot attend the ceremonies but for a very good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have all fled the fighting in Northern Mali that is related to the current Kel Tamashek/Taureg unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is a long history to this conflict but suffice it to say that like Omara Moctar Bombino, they are Kel Tamashek and have fled the ethinic cleansing that has been going on in southern Mali since January 17, 2012. 12:37 AM on 02/12/2012 Thanks for the update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very sad news in a perennially troubled region. 04:24 PM on 02/11/2012 Hmm..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No Bjork, Ladytron, The Howling Hex, Cults, Evangelista, L'il B, Pj Harvey, Radiohead? Youneed to get out of the woods more. 06:36 PM on 02/11/2012 Bebop, thats your personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what makes you think I should enjoy that stuff also? 10:01 AM on 02/12/2012 I'm just saying a lot a lot alot of these albums are from people who hang out in the woods and look like Abraham Lincoln...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or worse, consider john Denver the mostinfluential rocker ever, The inclusion of one of the bands I mentioned (or gasp skinny puppy) would have gone a long way to show a bit of diversity, never a bad thing... 12:40 AM on 02/12/2012 I really haven't been crazy about PJ Harvey since her awe-inspiring To Bring You My Love.I keep trying but don't feel it, though obviously many many others agree with you about hernew album which topped some British polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Radiohead was, to me, good not great, but likeBandini Permalink | Share it Ellen Lyons Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it Bebop210 Permalink | Share it Bandini Permalink | Share it Bebop210 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer119 Fans 9 Fans 127 Fans 28 Fans 119 Fans 28 Fans 127 FansThis user has chosen to opt out of the Badges program all of their more abstract work it might just take some time to sink in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm def an OK Computer v Kid A sort of guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bjork frankly I heard the music but felt it wasn't fair to judge outside the whole app per song thingie and just didn't get a chance to experience it properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heard all the rest except for Lil B, which I'll put on my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting. 09:55 AM on 02/12/2012 That's interesting about pj because i feel this album has far more to latch on to hook wise than to bring you my love (also one of my fave albums ever).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I suggest giving it and the bjork another listen preferably in vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The apps thing was red herring, a pr misadventure at best...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All 04:16 PM on 02/11/2012 Having heard very few of these, I can't compare, but two of the releases on this list that I did enjoy are "So Beautiful or So What" by Paul Simon and "El Camino" by The Black Keys. 12:40 AM on 02/12/2012 Thanks for commenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like those, I'm pretty sure you might discover some otheralbums worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope you sample the videos and discover something good. 02:06 PM on 02/11/2012 At first I thought " there's going to be no mention of Barbra Streisand and the nominations shereceived because her category is not even televised ( contemporary vocal) or some such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soeven though she has more Grammys then all of the above and , i might add, more talent, I thought it was understandable that she not be mentioned ..but then after reading about these random albums and songs that I have never heard of , I'm like ..o.k another Streisand hater ..or Anotherperson who doesn't think that Miss Streisand is relevant ..sorry but in my honest opinion she is moterelevant then all mentioned in this article! 12:46 AM on 02/12/2012 Well, I wasn't going over the Grammy categories and talking about performances and whoshould win and the such, but simply going over my favorite albums of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Streisand isindeed an exceptionally gifted singer and artist who towers over most everyone, not just the people on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't truly think she's scaled the peaks since The Broadway Album (at least, not in the studio, though the last decades have been more about liveperformances, I think).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I've still got more Streisand CDs than you can shake a stick at.Her latest didn't make my list this year, but that shouldn't brand me a hater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glad to knowher fans are as passionate as ever. 01:34 PM on 02/11/2012Permalink | Share it Bebop210 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Lee Harvey Grab a slice of Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't cost nothin'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it davidaltieri Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it Survival Suit Rock28 Fans 140 Fans 127 Fans 31 Fans 127 Fans 5 FansThis user has chosen to opt out of the Badges programAs a huge fan of Tom Waits, I'm happy to see that you included his latest release on your Grammy Preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, I'm a bit perplexed that Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waits loses points on your list for a song that I don't even think is on the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You refer to a song called "Last Year".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm guessing you mean "Last Leaf onthe Tree"? If so, I agree that it's not quite as strong as the rest of the album. 12:49 AM on 02/12/2012 Thanks for pointing that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In condensing it down my review, I must have messed upsomewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He consistently delivers some of the best albums of the year, again and againbut this one is even more special than most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A real late peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting. 12:04 PM on 02/11/2012 I just recently activated my Amazon Cloud Player and uploaded all my old music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been jonezingfor new material however, but other than the popular music on telly and radio (of course I ownAdele's "21" and I would also include Amy Wineheart's "Back to Black" to a list of great albums) I had no clue where to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THANK YOU, am so happy to enjoy your blog this morning playing gorgeous stuff from kd Lang, Clapton, Paul Simon, more favorites from the Black Keyes, andmostly, a bunch of neat stuff from artists I am not familiar with!

In the past week over 60,000 civilianshave been displaced according to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is a msg from their facebook page. "Hi everyone.Soon after the uprising broke out last week, people started leaving the centre of our home villages,to avoid any fighting between the rebels and the Malian army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We've been out here in the bush, for quite a few days, with many women, children and old people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of us are suffering from hunger and the terrible cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's really very very cold at night around this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Things are tough forsure, but everyone is holding up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to everyone for their thoughts and prayers for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keepingsending them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We really hope that everything is going to be ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks, Tinariwen." 03:02 PM on 02/11/2012 Normally I would be inclined to say that your post is off-topic and unfair to the author andnot indulge you further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But music (and the arts in general) allow us to connect beyond the limitations of self- identity and I feel it is appropriate to care for the strangers with whom we connect emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am not a religious person so I cannot offer my prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I offer my bestwishes, my attention and a little information:Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Shauni Waterdragon Speak now or forever hold your peas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it MaliCrisis Permalink | Share it BDinJoburg127 Fans 392 Fans 127 Fans 3 Fans 130 FansThe situation is not only one of conflict but of food shortage that is expected to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oxfam and the International Red Cross have programmes in place in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You would do better to post at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120211/af-mali-refugees/ where the issue you address is the thread topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whilst I understand that your comment was meant in good faith I think you place an unfair burden on Michael Giltz. 11:25 AM on 02/11/2012 as a 62yr old who still tries to keep up with new music and new artists i am not one to say badthhings about anyones list but how one can get to 50 artists without mentioning wild beasts Smotheror kate bush's 50 words for snow and Weeknd's house of balloons is beond my comprehension. 12:10 PM on 02/11/2012 Thanks for sharing some of your favorites from the year not on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Weeknd wasobviously on a lot of lists.I liked it but haven't fallen in love yet but def will keep listening.I'm crazy for Kate Bush and enjoyed the typically quirky songs of 50 Words For Snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again, for me it was a three star album out of four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've certainly had many of her albums on my lists over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw Wild Beasts on some UK lists but didn't catch up with itbefore the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll definitely check it out so thanks for the tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With 10,000+albums out a year, there's always more to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost EntertainmentPermalink | Share it awol1949 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it Page: 1 2 Next â€º Last Â» (2 total)0 Fans 127 Fans</p>
