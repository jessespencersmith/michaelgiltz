                <p>Saturday, September 7, 2019 NON-FICTION ÔÄïÔ¨ÇIt‚Äôs the Final Countdown The Black Comedy of ‚ÄòMidnight In Chernobyl‚Äô  February 18, 2019 ÔÄáMichael Giltz I kept laughing out loud while reading this marvelous, remarkably-detailed look at the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That made it a little awkward when someone asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you reading?‚Äù and I had to say ‚Äúanonfiction book about the worst nuclear disaster in history (so far).‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt ha-ha laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a bleak,‚ÄúDr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strangelove‚Äù sort of laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn‚Äôt do anything else in face of the idiocy and incompetence and sheer, frightening, dear-god-did-they-really detail I found on every page of Adam Higginbotham‚Äôs book Midnight InChernobyl .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tragedy begins with the very design of the nuclear reactors built at Chernobyl and throughout the SovietUnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People knew they were deeply flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that totalitarian state didn‚Äôt like admitting error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disastrous accidents happened throughout the USSR, but they deemed each one a state secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state didn‚Äôt even tell the nuclear scientists and engineers at other power plants about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they certainly didn‚Äôt learn from theaccidents,improve designs, or share what they learned with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They made roofs of asbestos when othermaterial wasn‚Äôt available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They used subpar building material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to the fall of that empire, and a mountain of declassified documents, Higginbotham gives a blow-by- blow account of the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He recounts the shame and bravery of those involved (sometimes the shame andthen bravery of the same person).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he continues the story through the cover-up and the blowback fromMikhail Gorbachev‚Äôs attempt at perestroika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most importantly, he details the ongoing environmental andpersonal disaster impacting the earth and the people involved.‚Üê The Eyes Don‚Äôt Have It Prepping for a Post-Roe America ‚ÜíHigginbotham captures the voices and personalities of so many vivid characters, from high-ranking Party officials to the first responder who was luckily drunk the night he responded to the fire at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This gained him some all-important protection from radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most memorably, he profiles Maria Protsenko, a diminutive architect, formidable, talented and no-nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was born in China to Sino-Russian parents and probably had two strikes against her from the start in the USSR.Her grandfather disappeared during a Stalinist purge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two siblings died unnecessarily because of a curfew thatkept her family from taking them to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her father descended into opium addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And still Protsenko became a model Communist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She planned the city where workers at Chernobyl lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the sudden evacuation, she proved a model of efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she worked with soldiers trying to deal with the crisis and ultimately wall off the devastatedarea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Towards the end of the book, the author interviews her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he can‚Äôt discern the smell of a book shebrought out of Cherbobyl, Protsenko puckishly blows dust from it into his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he‚Äôs understandablyhorrified, she laughs off his concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who couldn‚Äôt love her? Whether you read it for the drama, for the careful and fascinating science around this tragedy, as a warning for the future or simply as a horror story to share with unsuspecting brunch companions, Midnight In Chernobyl isfirst-rate, funny and ultimately so very, very sad.
