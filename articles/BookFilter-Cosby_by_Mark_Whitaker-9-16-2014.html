"Cosby" shows the years after you make it can also be fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cosby's struggles withcensors and studios, the constant seesawing in how he was perceived both by white and black audiences and howhis first attempts to capitalize on fame with a production company bankrupted him are all spelled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hugeimpact of "I Spy," his ground-breaking work on "Fat Albert" and "The Electric Company," the ahead of its time sitcom"The Bill Cosby Show," his innovative work as a spokesperson for various products and of course "The Cosby Show"and its seismic success are all covered in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And throughout it all, Whitaker threads his work as a stand-up,showing how Cosby shapes his material and why that has been the lifeblood of his career despite the hit films andrecord-breaking TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book provides some good cultural context but never quite scales the heights ofgreatness the way its subject did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it gets the job done and reveals a career and talent that is truly singular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It willsurely be snapped up by fans and send others back to his seminal comedy albums and lesser known projects. --MIchael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“A smart, revealing biography of an iconic American funnyman. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fascinating look at a complicated genius.” -People“Whitaker’s wonderfully thorough biography of America’s most accom​plished comedian provides context and depthas he analyzes Bill Cosby’s work.” - New York Times Book ReviewFluid, admiring, packed with detail and anecdotes.” - Wall Street Journal“Invaluable . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whitaker makes a convincing argument that issues of race and politics have preoccupied Cosbythroughout his life.” - New Yorker“Whitaker’s clear-eyed, fair-minded and deftly written book takes up all the momentous stops of Cosby’s life’s journey. . . by allowing us to see Cosby’s tumultuous life in full, Whitaker’s book makes it possible to imagine Bill Cosbybeing regarded as one of the first prophets of what optimists of all colors believe will someday be a “post-racialAmerica.” - USA TODAY“Absorbing . . . makes a persuasive case for Cosby as a groundbreaking comic and a quiet but far-ranging pioneer ofblack advancement.” - Publishers Weekly“Readable, thoughtful life of the brilliant comedian and . . . an eye-opening…</p>
