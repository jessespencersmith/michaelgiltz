"I feel like I've raised my head out of the water and somewhere ahead of me is the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and I just keep stroking toward the finish line," says O'Brien, who has been nominated for numerous TonyAwards and won Best Director twice: In 2003, for helming the musical "Hairspray," and in 2004, for the Kevin Kline-led "Henrv IV""It has been a long time We went into rehearsals on Sept. 6 and I haven't done mJrthing but this since " With dozens of characters, Stoppard's "The Coast of Utopia" trilogy ('Voyage" and "Shipwreck" are the titles of Parts I md 2) depicts the rise of the Russian intelligentsia in the mid-1800s, a group of privileged aris- tocrats who grapple with philosophy md love and family squabbles - all under the watchful, condenning eyes of the serfs who make their lavish lives possible First staged in London in 2002, it took a massive commitment from Lincoln Cen- ter to make such a gamble possible in New York Now, the work has been showered with praise; there's a crush of ticket buyers yearning to see the cycle all in one day, and "Salvage" has been extended to May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The starry cast includes Ethan Hawke,NOTES FROM ON THE GROUND EthAN HAWKE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MATthA Plimpton, rennifel Ehle ard Kellie overbey (from l.) observe a country on the brink of revolutionary change in 'voyage,' Part 1 of'The coast of Utopia."

O'Brien agrees. "Let's notjust look at it in terms of how difficult it hm been or how chal- lenging it is," says the dilectoi who is work- ing intenselywith Stoppdd, who h6 contin- ued to trim md shape md refine the plays "It has been glorious- - And I'mincredi- bly gmtefuI md sort of mued that I'm still standing at the end of this." For Hawke, who plays the blustery yeam- ing-for-action revolutiontry Balflnin, this is tbe culmination of m exceDtional m oftheater work, which includes "Henry M' md a 2005 revival of David Rabe's "Hulyburly." "I m't even be objective about Ethan," says O'Brien, who had high praise for t}le en- tire ensemble "Ethm wm the first to com- mit; he wre the first tumbler to fall, md it all fell into place Billy cme almost ime- diately thereafter, and suddenly, much to my trtonishment, I got this extraordinary compmy. "I'Ye seen Ethm grow since'Heffy ry"' continues O'Brien- "He's fomidable I think he has been through a lot of unhappiness, but it has tempered him It hasn't made him bitter and it hdn't defeated him; it hil enltrged him He's gol. a seclion in the last play that is as beautiful as anything I've ever seen in my life lt's the entire rmge of what he is as Bakunin md what he is as Ethm," Now, rehersals are wer, all three plays re being perfomed in repertory the casu- al backstage book club hm moved on from Tolstoy's "Arna Karenina" to Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons," and already, it seems, the May closing of this epiq i5 coming fast"Theater is present tense, in the moment, as opposed to film which [seems] so much more nostalgic," says Hawke "People have this idea that flLm is imortal, that it lives forever Itjust doesn't If your butt is inthe seat lat a play] and you're watching some- thing that's really special, it's special to you rightnow, this instant - you're not going to be able to rent it next yeil sVhenwe do the lilt perfor- mmce md the â‚¬liys come in with the sledgehmmers md crowbrs md the garbage bins and stad iirowing ou set away, it's such a strmge meditation on death or something, it's so sad .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the fact that it's passing makes each perfommce special." O'Brien is looking foMild lo a cruise to Costa Rica before, almost unbelievably, moving on to motlter trilogy at the Metro- politan Opera: Puccini's "Il Trittico," a collection of tlrree one-act works "This has taken every bit of refinement, wit, blocking, cheerleading and editing that I cm possibly muster," says O'Brien- "I don't know what it's going to be like when I frnally finish this " a</p>
