Did they thinkthe show was that close to perfect? Fifteen months and no significant reworking of the plot or addition of keynew songs or recasting or anything?It's harmless fun and I was rooting for it, but a second viewing exhausts what little enthusiam I mustered,especially when they couldn't be bothered to do much more than spruce it up here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a montageof this would-be throwback to the 1950s musical (which Aladdin does much better).The story, based on the film written by Andrew Bergman, is silly enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A nebbishy fellow loves his gal but acurse placed on him by an overbearing mother freezes him with fright whenever marriage looms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She losespatience and they impulsively head to Vegas to do the deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's when a tough gangster/card sharp spots thegal: she's a dead ringer for his late, beloved wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cheats our hero in cards and saddles the guy with nearly$60,000 in debt, forcing him to suggest his gal "hang out" with the gangster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In revenge for even suggestingsuch a thing -- and surprised by the thug's charm -- she does just that, flying off with him to Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our herogoes off in pursuit and finally catches up with her back in Vegas, making a dramatic splash to win her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ifyou've seen the movie or just the ads for it, you know this somehow involves a troupe of Flying Elvises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, it'sVegas.The show has been touched up here and there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sets are a little better, thanks mostly to some detailedprojections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the grey and wood screens that dominate the color palette don't exactly scream Vegas and12/16/2015Theater: Second "Honeymoon In Vegas" No Better Than First; Charming Gyllenhaal | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=a2ed3d07-f1dd-4172-88b5-bb4abdc12195&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/6prove generic and tiresome when seen in Sin City and Hawaii and airport lounges (about the only place theyactually belong).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mild but unpleasant racism of some minor characters (Asian tourists who used to goggle atshowgirls and a Hawaiian gals pidgin English) have thankfully been eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the songs, the staging, thebasic structure of the show remain sadly identical to that out of town tryout long ago.Rob McClure is a Tony nominee for Chaplin and has a certain nebbishy, Everyman appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm not sureabout his star power and both he and Brynn O'Malley have such generic characters to play, it's hard to care forthem much at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't help that they're separated for virtually the entire second act. (He's trying to get herback, but since she doesn't know this or see him trying, it doesn't have much impact.) Tony Danza is an amiablepresence but remains entirely wrong for the role of a menacing gangster we might actually fear the way youinstinctively worry James Caan in the movie might have meanness in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danza is a pussycat by nature and itmakes his villain pretty toothless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also very thin of voice, sounding even less sure of himself this timearound.They get most everything wrong here, right down to saving pennies by NOT having O'Malley toss the bouquetshe's clutching into the audience at the end of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Robert Brown delivered two good songs hereand few okay ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Josefsberg has fun as a Vegas crooner and nails "When You Say Vegas," whichshould be an amusing aside but unfortunately is the ring-a-ding-ding highlight of Act One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Danza -- amusical theater fan and cabaret performer -- surely has dreamt of being in an original Broadway show all his life.Here Brown gives him the treat of "You Made The Wait Worthwhile." It's an act two number with a very modestrange written right in his sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danza gets to strum a ukulele and sing this little ditty that genuinely soundslike a throwback to some 1930s gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the show's best number by a mile, the only one with any emotionalimpact and Danza -- and the audience -- have at least one happy memory to share.THE WOODSMAN *** 59 E 59It's not often you get a second chance to see a smaller show that came and went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, The Woodsman hasreturned and anyone with affection for puppetry, fairy tales and clever pure theater should jump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It explores theworld of L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frank Baum by telling the origin story of the Tin Woodman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how it's told is what makes this showspecial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer, co-director and star James Ortiz has an introductory narration setting the stage for the Land ofOz and the fearful lives of the Munchkins who reside there under the reign of evil witches.But after that brief section, the show is virtually wordless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is told with a troupe of actors and somesimple but effective theatrical flourishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think Cheek By Jowl or Peter and the Starcatcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who needselaborate effects when a few actors holding up branches can let you believe immediately in a menacing forestthat grabs and clutches at anyone who dares to pass through? Various characters are brought to life either byactors or puppetry, especially a menacing creature and the show's highpoint, an aged but frightening WickedWitch of the East.The storytelling on display is charming but this is not for little children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As told in The Tin Woodman Of Oz, ourhero begins as a man but his axe is cursed and it slowly dismembers him limb by limb (which he replaces with atin appendage) until there's nothing left and he can't love the woman of his dreams anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with thewitch, this slow dissolve into mechanical man is handled beautifully. (Ortiz also did the set design and puppetry.)Despite his guiding hand on the show, Ortiz wasn't even my favorite actor on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I much preferred ElizaSimpson as the Woodsman's true love, Will Gallacher and Laura Nordvig as our hero's parents and Alex J.Gould caught my eye in various parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This just proves Ortiz is smart enough to surround himself with talent.At one hour, the show is just the right length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a little repetition, with the parent's story proving too similarin its telling to the romance of the Woodsman and his heroine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The score by onstage performer Edward W.Hardy is excellent though a song towards the end is a little discordant and less successfully sung (or arranged?)12/16/2015Theater: Second "Honeymoon In Vegas" No Better Than First; Charming Gyllenhaal | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=a2ed3d07-f1dd-4172-88b5-bb4abdc12195&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/6than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is all to say that Strangemen &amp; Co. -- the troupe Ortiz is a co-artistic director of -- is verytalented and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excitingly, they should improve and grow by leaps and bounds as they continue to mountworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of Pigpen Theatre Co. and original theater in general take note.CONSTELLATIONS ** 1/2 MANHATTAN THEATRE CLUB AT SAMUEL J FRIEDMAN THEATREConstellations is not the show it thinks that it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luckily, it has two engaging actors with chemistry and charm toburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jake Gyllenhaal and Ruth Wilson make the evening an easy pleasure, reveling in the actor catnip ofgetting to play various bits of dialogue over and over again in different styles: one time angry, another time sadand so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to appreciate their talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't be surprised to find that Nick Payne's play is ultimatelyexhausting and confusing.The set-up is simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We watch two people meet cute at a BBQ in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The woman Mariannegoofily talks about how impossible it is to lick one's elbow, which is sad, she says, because if you can lick yourelbow you'll live forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man Roland reacts in varying ways to this: sometimes he shuts her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then thelights flash and the scene begins again and he gently makes clear he's in a relationship or just getting out of arelationship or he gamely starts to try and lick his own elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In most of these varying outcomes, they do notseem likely to start dating, but one or two seem to do the trick.Later we learn Marianne works in science and her explanation of what she actually does involving astronomyand sorting through the noise of space to determine patterns and cull information about the stars etc. can goover Roland's head or confuse him or turn him on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally, as visions of Groundhog Day appear, Marianneclarifies exactly what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the idea of the multiverse, that idea that every action you take (or don'ttake, which is itself an action) creates its own reality, its own timeline of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one reality you marry the girlof your dreams, in another you become a rock star rather than an accountant with dreams of music frustrated),in another you move to Denver rather than staying in your hometown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All these realities exist at the same timeparallel to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're not all dramatically different from one another but they do exist.Constellations will constantly explore the idea of a multiverse, the many realities where a romance can go indifferent directions or never take place at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think Michael Frayn or Tom Stoppard and you'll have an idea ofthe heady marriage Payne wanted to make between earthy love and high-minded theory.Count me in! Multiverses are right up the alley of someone like me who devoured sci-fi as a kid and seen itexplored in works by Italo Calvino and Borges and Millhauser and countless others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are you confused? Think ofit this way: in one reality you have cereal for breakfast, in another you have oatmeal and in yet another you skipbreakfast entirely but this prompts you to go to lunch earlier than usual where you accidentally meet the love ofyour life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get it? Now not every choice will have dramatic impact. (Though if everyone suddenly begins to favoroatmeal over cereal maybe yet another family farm goes out of business and the angry son in that familybecomes a new Hitler! So you never know.)Unfortunately, this show never actually explores the idea of a multiverse or a multiplicity of possibilities in anyrelationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It thinks it does but in fact Constellations is more akin to the acting exercise found in the brilliantpiece Sure Thing by David Ives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In that short work, a man and a woman in a cafe meet and every time one ofthem fumbles or says the wrong thing, the action resets and they get another chance until finally at the end theyromantically click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's great fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, in many realities, Roland and Marianne date, move in togetherand one of them cheats on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see this again and again: in one variation, Marianne tells him ratherabruptly, in another she tells him angrily, in a third she's sad, in a fourth he tells her that he's cheated and so on.But except in the most banal and uninteresting manner, these aren't really multiple realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In each of them,one has cheated on the other and they're sure to break up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How they get there may be mildly different but theend result is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that the news was broken angrily or sadly may be "different" but it's not different12/16/2015Theater: Second "Honeymoon In Vegas" No Better Than First; Charming Gyllenhaal | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=a2ed3d07-f1dd-4172-88b5-bb4abdc12195&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;4/6in a way that's terribly revealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Payne does this again and again.Similarly, the show explores perhaps unintentionally another trope of sci-fi and fantasy: that's the story of truelove which triumphs in any multiverse whatever obstacle may be placed in its path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some lovers are simplymeant to be together and will be in one way or another (perhaps tragically or happily but always memorably) nomatter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show unintentionally takes this point of view -- which is rather opposite to the idea ofmultiverses where so many paths coexist at the same time -- because no matter what happens we sense theshow is gonna make damn sure these two get together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILD SPOILER ALERT There's also a looming illness,which is tipped quite early in the show, so it's not much of a spoiler to mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This tragedy of a short life cutsacross most of the possibilities we're shown, another example where the show isn't sure of what it hopes to do.END OF SPOILER.The confusion extends to the production overseen by director Michael Longhurst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scenic and costumedesign is by Tom Scutt, with lighting by Lee Curran and sound design by David McSeveney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no surprisethey'd be confused about what to do since the play is muddled itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage is bare with a striking clutch ofwhite balloon-like bulbs in a clump above, tails floating down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first scene, one bulb lights up as if toindicate one possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When their first meet collapses, the scene resets and another bulb lights up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Okay, butthis is soon dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later neurons fire off in the cluster of bulbs, akin to the brain waves that might be goingakimbo in one character's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This too is dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Towards the finale, actual white balloons drift down at onesad moment, like tears or rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a brief arresting image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then a minute later a few more balloons driftdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a few minutes later a handful of balloons again float down. it feels so random you begin to wonder ifthe last few were stuck in the rafters and just got loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To top it off, all the balloons go multi-colored at the finalein a sort of rude counter to one character's expressed taste in memorial celebrations -- no balloons, they insist.Why would the show ignore this?Again, Payne and the show are blessed to have fresh Emmy winner Wilson (for The Affair) and fresh Oscar-snubbed Gyllenhaal (for Nightcrawler, but being snubbed is a grand tradition so he should embrace it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thestructure and overall ideas of Constellations may be awfully muddled but scene to scene it's fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, we seeRoland propose to Marianne in various ways; again, this isn't a terribly interesting exploration of multiverses butit is fun and the emotional high point of the show as Gyllenhaal finally blurts out his love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd be happy to gothrough endless variations on love as long as these two are involved.TAYLOR MAC A 24 DECADE HISTORY OF POPULAR MUSIC: 1930s-1950s (DRESS REHEARSAL) ** 1/2 NEW YORK LIVE ARTSThis is my first experience of Taylor Mac (one doesn't just see Taylor Mac) and I'm at a bit of a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's in themidst of a two year process developing a wildly ambitious 24 hour event which will be dubbed A 24 DecadeHistory Of Popular Music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each hour will be devoted to one decade, leaping from the 1700s to the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In aflip on what Talking Heads did in their classic concert film, Mac says he'll begin with 24 musicians on stage andone will leave each hour until it's winnowed down to one for the finale. (In Stop Making Sense, the show beganwith Byrne alone on the stage and they slowly added musicians until the raucous finale.)You can expect LOTS of audience participation (Mac wants to build up a sense of community in the audienceeven as the literally 24 hour performance wears them down).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There will be showers on stage, drag queens, anda cast of thousands apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As one of the most acclaimed performers of recent years, Mac is swinging forthe fences with a show so long you could watch Einstein On The Beach almost five times or Wagner's The RingCycle twice in the time it will take to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why not? The venue lucky enough to get it -- St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann'sWarehouse? BAM? Lincoln Center -- will definitely have a happening on their hands and one of the signalevents of 2016.What we saw at New York Live Arts was unquestionably a rough draft of three hours of that event, covering the12/16/2015Theater: Second "Honeymoon In Vegas" No Better Than First; Charming Gyllenhaal | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=a2ed3d07-f1dd-4172-88b5-bb4abdc12195&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;5/61930s to the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A dress rehearsal Mac called it and that it was in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show ranthree and a half hours and many anecdotes were rambling and unfocused as Mac introduced one song orconcept or spun out the many audience moments (such as getting everyone to come on stage and sit on thefloor or forcing all the white people to flee to the suburbs -- the side aisles -- while the people of color wereinvited to camp out in the center seats for a few songs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He forgot the words once or twice (he's got a hell of alot of songs to learn!) and some arrangements were nailed down better than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It left you both intriguedabout what the final show might look like and a little exhausted at the same time.This is a performance from Chicago in October of 2013 from An Abridged Concert of the History of PoliticalPopular Music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's in the same vein as his current project but has no connection; it's just to give you a taste ofthe Taylor Mac experience.An unquestioned highlight were the decade-specific costumes by Machine Dazzle (aka Matthew Flower).Sequins pop up in the 1930s because machines finally existed to make them practical in clothing, but they werestill too expensive for all but the wealthy...or Taylor Mac of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similar attention to detail is a hallmark of MD,whose suburban skirt was a highlight of the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band was solid throughout, especially Viva Deconcini onelectric guitar and the handsome musical director, pianist and background singer Matt Ray.Perhaps it's just Taylor Mac's style, but what gives me pause is the fact that so few of the actual musicalperformances proved memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too many were jokey, ironic performances of songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One could practicallysee the quotes around every line to indicate a certain distance whether Mac was vamping up "Brother Can YouSpare A Dime?" or joshing around on "Sway." This may simply be a factor to the early days nature of theproject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly the show is Mac's gay white boy in suburbia perspective on popular music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But "Some Day MyPrince Will Come" and "Hot Nuts" and "The Trolley Song" and "Where The Boys Are" AND "Secret Love" is onewinking gay anthem (or five) too many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've all been done a thousand times before in a gay context and Macshould either ditch them or come up with an arrangement or performance that brings something new to them orat least gives them the dignity of a straightforward performance (pun intended) rather than seeming to think theirmere inclusion is amusing.This section has 36 songs but too many other choices are uninspired. "Mockingbird Hill" and "The Stripper" tomock suburbia again prove too easy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One doesn't want three dozen oddball obscurities but still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evenless obvious choices don't work here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mac's monologue on growing up queer in suburbia was mostly unfocusedand undeveloped and didn't remotely make the case for segueing into the great Johnny Cash number "FolsomPrison Blues," which doesn't really equate with a gay boy's feeling of being trapped on any level. (The criminal inthe song actually IS guilty and deserves imprisonment and knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't tell me the boy feels the same way; itstill doesn't really work because we all know the boy would be wrong.)Perhaps it's the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe earlier decades won't prove so full of schtick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, Amber Gray does anexcellent version of Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit," which is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her performance is elegant in its slowbuild and intensity without every straying into histrionics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But given the rest of the three hours, it also feelsdramatically out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Little else is remotely that serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More often, Mac is constructing elaborate andflimsy "contexts" for numbers, like spending much of the 1940s with the idea that he's a performance in a Naziconcentration or death camp, where many German cabaret performers were imprisoned and did in fact put onshows. (Maybe this should be a specific show in its own right.) Anyway, Mac gets a few laughs by draggingaudience members on stage, putting on sequin Nazi armbands on them and then having two women play thehorses while they ride in a carriage throughout the German countryside as Mac sings the Oklahoma gem "TheSurrey With the Fringe On Top." Whew! That's a long way to go for a few giggles and it doesn't ever really jell inany way, typical of so many of his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again, these are ideas, rough sketches and presumably (hopefully)he's working through many ideas, tossing out the ones that don't work and zeroing in on the ones that do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hopethere's a lot less audience participation because know it seems to take place after every other song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't12/16/2015Theater: Second "Honeymoon In Vegas" No Better Than First; Charming Gyllenhaal | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=a2ed3d07-f1dd-4172-88b5-bb4abdc12195&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;6/6feel like a community so much as an unpaid extra.And yet, and yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At times Mac's context is pointed and sharp and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At times the audience participationfeels simple and right, rather than strained and over-elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At times the performances are heartfelt or funnyrather than just hopped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mac hit a beautiful stretch almost precisely in the middle of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His medley of"Don't Fence Me In" and the little-known "Why Did I Ever Leave Wyoming" is funny and fierce, offering up a tidydig at conservatives for loving the song ("They don't want to be fenced in," Mac says at one point, " but theydon't mind fencing other people in!") while at the same time pairing a very well known song with an obscure oneand elevating both thanks to stringing them together. (He does a similarly successful thing at the finale, mergingthe melody of "Peter Gunn Theme" with the folk classic "Turn! Turn! Turn!").That's followed by a very good performance of "Soliloquy" from Carousel and then a perhaps apocryphal but stilltouching story surrounding "You Are My Sunshine," which Mac follows with asking the audience to sing it alongwith him, first with the band, then with just him and finally the audience alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pete Seeger would be proudbecause that's one great way to build a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the show's peak, a haunting "Ghost Riders InThe Sky" where the arrangement by Ray, the lighting, the excellent guitar work by Deconcini and a superlativevocal by Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He caps that by declaiming the Auden poem "A Walk After Dark."Why does this section work so well? First most of the songs are performed without frantically vamping them upwith humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Secondly, the pairing of known and unknown tunes is well considered. the arrangements are great.The monologues surrounding the tunes are more focused and thought out and the poem comes at just the rightmoment in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's every reason to believe the 24 hour extravaganza to be will come into sharp focusjust like this vivid section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mac is mounting various sections and surely refining and working on it, becomingmore sure about what he's doing as he discovers exactly what he has so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butit's going to take a lot of work._____________Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of the forthcoming website BookFilter, a book lover'sbest friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a website that lets you browse for books online the way you do in a physical bookstore, providescomprehensive info on new releases every week in every category and offers passionate personalrecommendations every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like a fall book preview or holiday gift guide -- but every week inevery category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals theindustry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'savailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast ofcelebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.Note: Michael Giltz is provided with free tickets to shows with the understanding that he will be writing a review.All productions are in New York City unless otherwise indicated.</p>
