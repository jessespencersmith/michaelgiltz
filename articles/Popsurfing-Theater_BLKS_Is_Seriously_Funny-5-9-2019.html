                <p>THURSDAY, MAY 09, 2019 THEATER: 'BLKS' IS SERIOUSLY FUNNY BLKS ** 1/2 out of **** THE ROBERT W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILSON MCC THEATER SPACE To the growing list of playwrights of color pushing the boundaries of contemporary theater, you can happily add the name of Aziza Barnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it any wonder they attracted the attention of red-hot director RobertO'Hara? No, it is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gives BLKS a solid showcase that also shows off the versatility of the mainstage at the relatively new Robert W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson MCC Theater Space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was my first visit to the latest addition in NYC's collection of artistic spaces but it won't be my last.And this was my first chance to see a work by Barnes, but it surelywon't be my last for that either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this broad but pointed comedy, Octavia is having a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She (Paige Gilbert) freaks out over a mole on her clitoris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't thereyesterday! When her lover/friend with benefits/whatever Ry (CoralPeña) demurs when asked to play amateur gynecologist, Octavia has had enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She ends their brief fling/burgeoning romance (I don't know what to call it because neither does Octavia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When roommateJune (Antoinette Crowe-Legacy) barges in and reveals her boyfriendhas cheated on her (again) and a relative of Octavia says thepotentially cancerous mole needs to be dealt with right away, they andfellow roomie Imani (Alfie Fuller) agree there's only one solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Day drinking, rolling a blunt and generally partying, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What follows is a roundelay of sexual entanglements, hilarious banter and the unwelcome but inevitable downer of reality intruding in onthe fun via a violent confrontation on the streets and social media updates on the latest killing of a young black man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike other recent plays, BLKS is not extravagantly out there or form- breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a series of sketches, just a well-constructed play with characters bouncing off one another in unexpected, revealing ways and with a joyous sense of sisterhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

And while the humor is broad and cranked up, unlike Barnes we never doubt its essential seriousness either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Hara oversees the show with affection but several elements hold itback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scenic design by Clint Ramos is a trickster in its own right.The stage is wide and deep but the central space of the shared living room in their apartment is presented at a cramped, odd angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's puzzling until the set rotates again and again, almost going widescreenas Ramos reveals a bathroom, bedrooms, a club and even a city streetwith subway entrances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet it felt over-elaborate and attention-grabbing to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You shouldn't be thinking about the sets as much as we do here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, two roles are poorly cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marié Botha as That Bitch On The Couch is merely ok as a clueless white woman bedeviled by what's appropriate for her to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Octavia's love interest Ry was mishandled entirely by Peña, making her Off Broadway debut andproving very uncomfortable onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her body movement, her linedeliveries, literally everything about her proved awkward, never moreso than a key monologue at the climax she barely delivered, much less brought to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three leads are much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller reveals depths to Imani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crowe-Legacy is full-on Amazonian as she straddles the stage with herpersonality and take-command voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Gilbert anchors it all with ease as the conflicted but decent Octavia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing a string of male characters but mostly the nerdy, off-beat Justin (a guy who befriendsJune in a club), Chris Myers is scene-stealing good from start to finish.For a play centered on women, Barnes gifts him with a terrificshowcase and Myers makes the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish Barnes had trusted their own talents as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News alerts about the gunning down of young black men by the police both earlyon and at the end feel like an unnecessary attempt to prove the playhas serious intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never doubted it, thanks to the more organic► June (3) ▼ May (9) THEATER: 'BLKS' IS SERIOUSLY FUNNY MUSIC: CHRIS THILE CAPS CARNEGIE HALL RESIDENCY WI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: CIRQUE DU SOLEIL GETS ITS MOJO BACK THEATER: HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S LIFE WAS NO FAI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Yet even at the end, Barnes insists on a string of monologues that come from a different world than the colorful comedy they created and make us care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Barnes has a gift for character and dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
