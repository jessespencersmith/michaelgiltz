Make no mistake -- this is a story about legislation,lawmaking designed to create a central bank for the US (just like the rest of the developed world) despite massive popular resistance to the very idea of big government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it was the Democratic Party -- whose Jacksonian DNA rebelled against federal power -- that made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh how times have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lowenstein lays out the story of what became known asthe Aldrich Plan very ably, from the many panics (capped by the Panic of 1907) that made the need for a central bankShare This Book About The Author Roger Lowenstein MoreROGER LOWENSTEIN reported for The Wall Street Journal for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His work has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg , The New York Reviewof Books, Fortune, The New York TimesMagazine, and other publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His books include Buffett, When Genius Failed, Origins ‚Ä¶, and The End of Wall Street .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has three children and lives with his wife inNewton, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $18.00 (Paperback) Published: October 18, 2016 Publisher: Penguin Books Pages: 368 ISBN 10: 0143109847 ISBN 13: 9780143109846painfully obvious to the tussle over actually making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He details the secret meeting held on Jekyll Island that laid the groundwork for the Aldrich Plan to its transformation in Congress and how investigations into Wall Street corruption and politicians voting to benefit their own investments colored the final deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tale has many heroes including the noble embrace of the idea by President Woodrow Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But above all Lowenstein champions the role of Paul Warburg, a GermanJew who became a naturalized citizen while he argued and cajoled and analyzed the plan in all its various permutations.Lowenstein manages to make financial debates and legislative back and forth both comprehensible and engaging, no smallfeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll learn how the Great Depression of 1929 and the Great Recession of 2008 were both ameliorated by elements of the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet those financial tragedies might have been softened much more or even prevented if certain battles had been won at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes this a far from remote story. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúAs Roger Lowenstein tells it in ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs Bank,‚Äô an illuminating history of the Fed‚Äôs unlikely origin story, the central bank represented an ambitious ‚Äî and not entirely successful ‚Äî effort to resolve several long-standingtensions that lay at the heart of the American experiment in self-government: East Coast vs. the interior, urban sensibilities vs. rural ones, mercantile vs. agrarian interests, Wall Street vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Main Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is still working out the kinks.‚Äù‚Äî Washington Post ‚ÄúThe fun of the book ‚Äî and its enduring value ‚Äî lies in the rich details about the cranks, pawns and prophets who jousted with one another in the days of Teddy Roosevelt, William Taft and Woodrow Wilson.‚Äù ‚Äì Forbes ‚ÄúRoger Lowenstein tells, vividly and compellingly,‚Ä¶the remarkable tale of the politics, disagreements, decisionsand crises that culminated in the Federal Reserve Act‚Ä¶But Lowenstein, the author of several works on economics and finance, builds off it to describe the history of the era, the rise of the Progressive movement, the compromises and machinations that were critical to Congressional passage and the key figures in the drama of creating the Federal Reserve System.‚Äù‚ÄîRobert‚Ä¶ More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
