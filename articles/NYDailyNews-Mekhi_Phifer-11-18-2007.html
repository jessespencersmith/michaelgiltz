                <p>MOVIES Mekhi Phifer of 'ER' produces a holiday film ByMrcnAEL Grrnz ! fyou're around this holiday season, I you might want to join "ER" actor I Mekhi Phifer md his family for their I mual get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I "l always go back to Newyork for I the holidays," says Phifer, who was bom and raised in Hrlem but lives in LA.. where he tapes his leading role on the longtime NBC hir. "My family and I have a huge Christmas party, which is al- ways fun- We give gifts, we have a pok- er tomament, we sing Christmas carols and we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have 70 or 80 people there, r with the family md fiends of famijy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phifer knows his poker: He beat out Neil Patrick Haris to win a recent,,Celeb. rity Poker ShowdoM" toumament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he doesn't play the card shark with his i family, which just expanded with the btth of a son for Phifer md h.is frmc6e. "I lonlyl sponsor the pokertourna- ment," says the 32-yetr-old. .tast yeil theThe Phifers get together from all over the country for the holidays - and if Mekhi has his way, one event other fami- lies around the countrv might do is head to the movies for "Thii Chrlstmas," a light fuama he executive-produced about a hol- iday get-togetierstarring Detroy Lindo, Regina King,Inretta Devine, Idris Elba ('The Wire") and Phifer in a small role as a frrefiBhter wooing one of the women of the Whitfield family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It opens Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Added pop comes from R&amp;B phenome- nonCtris BroM, who stas as the yomg- est Whitfield, Michael, who hrbore a se- cret dream to be a singer. (Needless to say, Brown gets up on talent night at a local bar md nails Otis Redding's .Try a Linle Tendemess.") "He was obvious [casting.],,' says Phifer. "He was just perfect for it." In the filrn, siblings bicker md make up, cheating spowes are exposed, secrets spill out and even Silta stops by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And phi- fer hopes his producing debut will become a tradition, like his own holiday fave. "My thing wtr 'A Christmas Story, with the kid md how he wants t}le BB gun,. says Phifer, who first came to attention in Spike lâ‚¬e's'Clockers" in 1995 mdwas seen in "I Know What You Did Ist Sum- me4" "O" and "8 Mile" before joining.ER" nve years ago tr the principled, driven Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gregory Pratt "Every yeil'A Christmas Stort' comes on and I've g'ot to watch it," says Fhifer.grand prize was two tickets totheBahamas Second prize might be a tick- ets to 'Color Pur- ple,' md out to din- ner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the kids, we have bingo and grve away Game- Boys- It gives peo- ple a chance who wouldn't normal- ly be able to do that to go to the Bahamas and enjoy life.""Hopefully,'This Christmas' will be one of those mainstays I liked having a main- ly African-Americm cast, but not making a quote-unquote AfTi- can-American film.
