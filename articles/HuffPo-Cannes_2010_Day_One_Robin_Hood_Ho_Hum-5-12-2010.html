No, it's just one of many random scenes but the fact that it feels focused and real just puts the rest of the film to shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly, we watch the gals goofing around before and after their shows, complaining aboutbeing hustled from town to town, putting on their costumes, rehearsing and performing before they pack up, head to a new city and do it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much is discovered: Amalric's producer character has two sons, an ex-wife, an ex-girlfriend with breast cancer and mountains of debt and bad will in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theleader of the burlesque artists flirts mildly with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the show goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even this description is probably too forceful and direct to get across the meandering pointlessness of the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly I thought about the power of the moustache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amalric simply had to grow a seedy, porn-producer sort of stache andI immediately knew who this guy was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's in Competition simply because of Amalric's great track record as an actor. (The very light smattering of applause it received surely came from the French contingent.) But then, the festival never programs movies it is high about on the first or second day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least we got tosee some burlesque acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there's always tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his weekly music radio show at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: 'Fair Game' Movie Clip (VIDEO): No Trailer, But Clip Of Valerie Plame Drama Posted For Cannes "Fair Game," the film about former CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson andthe Bush administration's leaks about her identity, is set to premiere May 20...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McQueen Personally Selected Cate Blanchett's Cannes Gown (PHOTO) 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Jane Krakowski Reveals 1 of 8 camille grammer lady gaga miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman pregnant raven- symone More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Comments (3,187) History Channel Won't Show Katie Holmes Miniseries The Kennedys READ MORE Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo to Guest Star on Hawaii Five-0 READ MORE Lindsay Lohan's Post- Rehab Gift: a $25,000 Necklace READ MORE Petra Nemcova Engaged to British Actor Stephanie Seymour Caught Kissing Her Son?

Although Scott made "Bladerunn er," he also makes a few bucks from bad tv, presumable y to finance the films he's making now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reviewer needs to focus more on the films as films, and less what he would likethem to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Hood is not even a historical character, so whatever is done, said orfilmed bears no relation to history; it's what the director wants it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check out suchminor items as the cinematogr aphy and the mise-en-scene, if you can, prior to rendering critical judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stay away from all the plot summarizin g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That should be "presumabl y," and "less on what he would like them to be."
