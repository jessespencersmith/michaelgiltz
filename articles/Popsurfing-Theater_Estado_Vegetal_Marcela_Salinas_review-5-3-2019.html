                <p>FRIDAY, MAY 03, 2019 THEATER: "MANUELA INFANTE," OR REVENGE OF THE PLANT KINGDOM ESTADO VEGETAL *** out of **** BARYSHNIKOV ARTS CENTER If monologist Anna Deavere Smith could dance and preferred fiction to non, she might come up with something like the oddball pleasures ofEstado Vegetal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one person performance piece belongs at the Baryshnikov Arts Center for two good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, it was workshopped at the BAC in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second, every gesture, every movement by performer Marcela Salinas has purpose and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's abold, fascinating and slightly nutty work that will reward those ofan...expansive nature when it comes to the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the sort ofshow that begins simply, with a man answering questions from an unseen police officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end, actors don ceramic pots, then a giant plant gets the spotlight along with a microphone while you confidentlywait to hear what it has to say and it seems quite reasonable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can think of Estado Vegetal in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a manifesto for the plant kingdom, those members of this planet perhaps unfairly ravaged by homo sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also a one person show where Salinas captivatingly embodies the members of a neighborhood reeling from a tragic "accident." The branches of a massive old tree hit some power lines late at night, plunging their street into darkness just as young fireman Manuelcomes roaring down the road on his motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Salinas deliversmonologues by a host of people including a city worker in charge ofgreen spaces, a little girl who loves the tree, a busybody sticking her nose into everyone else's business, the mother of Manuel and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's also perhaps a mystery of sorts, with the prime suspect hiding in plain sight and boasting the rock-solid alibi of all arboreal criminals-- trees can't move or think or act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can they?MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (31) ► June (1) ▼ May (9) THEATER: 'BLKS' ISHere's a video about the piece when it was being developed at BAC in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needless to say, elements may have changed since then, but it nicely captures the artists and their creative processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Estado Vegetal is admirable and fun to watch, especially in the strong earlier half where one character after another comes to life through a combination of dialogue, movement, lighting and playful props.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thepiece was created by both director Manuela Infante and star Salinas, assisted strongly by the set, costume and lighting of Rocio Hernández.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I see no credit for sound design but voice recording was done by Poldel Sur and sound is a major player in the show's effect, with a loopingdevice giving Salinas the freedom to "interview" herself as well as create aural collages that do everything from mirror the crosstalk of two humans to encompassing a roaring inferno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Estado Vegetal is also an intense work of movement and sound that demands close attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pieces like this are hard to maintain for an hour; Estado Vegetal runs an unwise 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, it builds to a climactic moment in which the plants of the world finally give voice to their demands. (From the sound of it,humans are in for a world of hurt.) The scene is effective and sofreighted with grand finale symbolism (a fog machine, a sound collage that builds and builds in cataclysmic power, lighting that glows with doom and then fades to black, etc.) I naturally assumed we hadreached the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no, a substantial portion of the show remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That portion is fascinating in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet it feels extraneous; intellectually I understand it's not, but still....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse the plotting is more ellipticaland vague than the relatively easy to follow chorus of voices thatpreceded it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it all ties together (even a detour into the gothic) andthe philosophical ideas embodied in a flashback with Manuel give firmer voice to the show's intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, one felt impatient towards the end, an unhappy response to a work made withintelligence and passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, many people talk to their plants.But very few listen for a response.SERIOUSLY FUNNY MUSIC: CHRIS THILE CAPS CARNEGIE HALL RESIDENCY WI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: CIRQUE DU SOLEIL GETS ITS MOJOBACK THEATER: HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S LIFE WAS NOFAI...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movies, Books, Theater, Concerts, CDs I've See...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BookFilter Reading List TV and Film Must Watch ListTHEATER: "MANUELA INFANTE," OR REVENGE OF THE PLAN...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "BEETLEJUICE" SHOWS A LITTLE LIFE ► April (10) ► March (5) ► February (1) ► January (5) ► 2018 (33) ► 2017 (6) ► 2016 (2) ► 2015 (17) ► 2014 (2) ► 2013 (5) ► 2012 (17) ► 2011 (15) ► 2010 (10) ► 2009 (43) ► 2008 (86) ► 2007 (781) ► 2006 (2412) ► 2005 (5)NOTE: This piece has just one more performance in NYC on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But co-writer/director Manuela Infante is a major talent to keep aneye out for when she returns to the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And those interested in gettinga new perspective on plants might enjoy the delightful work of popularscience The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate by Peter Wohlleben .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a bestseller across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
