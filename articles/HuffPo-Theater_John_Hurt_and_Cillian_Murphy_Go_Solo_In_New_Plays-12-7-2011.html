(I think Hurt even toyedwith the way he said, "Spool;" something every actor must do to keep the story fresh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Harvey Theatrehas a wonderfully run-down aura, but it's probably too big and expansive for this very intimate piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ButHurt is too talented to make the night a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This performance may not have worked its wayinto my bones the way the last one did, but it was funny and sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lights dim and then slowly rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hurt seems to literally materialize in front of us, sitting at a wooden desk on a spare stage in a pool of light. (The show is directed invisibly by Michael Colgan and lightednicely by James McConnell.) Beckett toys with the obvious for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His character's name is Krapp andhe has bowel troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a banana peel is tossed onto the floor before Krapp slips on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audienceMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Former 'SNL' Star Makes Shocking Comments About Rape And Gay Friends Mitt Romney To Flood Victim: 'Go Home And Call 211' WATCH: Rachel Maddow At A Loss For Words After Clint Eastwood's RNC Speech Paul Ryan Admits Marathon Lie Eastwood Misfires 35 Awesome 'Simpsons' GIFs Strong-Arming Death: The Summer Wilson Story Celebs React To Eastwood's Wild SPeech Several Reported Killed In New Jersey Mall Shooting DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos September 1, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA CELEBRITY TV COMEDY FOOD STYLE ARTS BOOKS LIVE ALL SECTIONS Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy Drexler Gary Hart Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dennis Kucinich Kevin MaurerHOT ON THE BLOG Like 107 Posted: 12/07/11 03:35 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Entertainment Alerts Sign UpLike 1k Like 5k Like 2k Like 4k Like 4k Like 1k Like 1k Like 201 Recommend 3kOscars 2013 iPhone app iPad app Android phone app Android tablet app More Log in Create Accountisn't quite sure whether it's supposed to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's after Krapp takes a whole banana and inserts it in his mouth -- with most of the banana hanging down -- and stares dolefully out at the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This does cause titters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then Hurt does it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's essentially the same goofy image -- Krapp standing there with a banana in his mouth -- but because of the repetition and the way Hurt embodies this role, the sight is suddenly not comic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's terrifyingly sad and absurd the way life is absurd if you think about it for more than a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This surely is the essence of Beckett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grumpy, distracted Krapp is performing an annual ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every birthday he records some thoughtsand listens back on previous annual diaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Invariably, he returns to his 39th birthday when Krapp had abrief moment of happiness -- or at least a glimpse of happiness -- with a girl in a boat on a river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 69year old Krapp is disgusted with the pretensions and glib pronouncements of the younger Krapp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he'salso devastated at how even the frustrated 39 year old version of himself still had some fanciful feelingsalive inside him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The younger man was a fool, of course, but if only Krapp had the ability to be a foolagain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staring out at the audience with an emotion to thin and weak to be called despair, Krapp is a frightening figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether speaking out loud or listening to his younger self on audiotape, Krapp is desperately alone and knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show only lasts 55 minutes but it's a rich and enjoyably exhausting 55 minutes, wherever you may be seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MISTERMAN ** 1/2 ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANN'S WAREHOUSE Misterman by Irish playwright Enda Walsh (enjoying a huge success with the musical Once ) is a distant cousin to Krapp's Last Tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this show, the town idjiot Thomas Magill (Cillian Murphy) relives one fateful day in his life via the copious audio recordings he's made of the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walking into St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse is always a treat because the open space seems to transform itself for every show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, the audience is seated along bleachers of seats and a set rambles on from oneend of the warehouse all the way down to the other, with a scaffolding and stairs providing access to asecond level and various bits and pieces scattered about in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How in heaven's name willwe keep track of going on and who exactly will have good seats in this expansive setting? Everyone it turns out, for Murphy runs up and down the set and fills up the space wherever he may, whether on the second floor of a gymnasium, standing on a street corner or home having a cuppa with hismother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas is a sad figure and for a while he seems to be reliving and reenacting his daily routine, pausing at moments to redo a bit of dialogue or fumbling over his "cue." But eventually the story takes over and itseems we are witnessing the actual day in question, with the usage of audio recordings of other voices afresh way of telling the tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy Drexler Why It’s Important To Let Your Child Make Mistakes Gary Hart Welcome to the American Republic, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eastwood TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Movies Funny Videos Usher White House Chicago Crime Bill MaherColin Ferguson Shows Up At LA Premiere Spencer Matthews Talks About The Bachelor Winner Khloe Sean "Diddy" Combs Shows Some Love For Lawless When Can You See The Final 'Hobbit' Film?

Here's what to watch onTV http://t.co/Ygqtb4U6 via @HuffPostTVThomas is a bit of a nutter and unquestionably a prude who uses religion as a bulwark against his own feelings and as a bludgeon to make himself feel superior to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's always scribbling down comments about his neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Walsh has shown in The Walworth Farce and other shows, he is obsessed with storytelling and how we use it in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his shows really come to life when he movesbeyond elaborate conceits or meta-trappings (like audio recordings in lieu of other actors) and lets his characters breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Misterman comes to life when Thomas is cajoled into dancing by a waitress (even if she is a bit of a fun- time gal) or treated kindly by a mechanic who politely humors Thomas and his idea of them becoming missionaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We can see he's the town eccentric but also that Thomas has a place in this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, aloose cannon like this is an all-too familiar sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Thomas bludgeons to death a helpless dog at thehalfway mark, it's all too easy to spot where the story is headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, we are not surprised inthe least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But getting there is fun thanks to a sterling production that is top-notch on every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walsh directs Murphy clearly and the creative team he assembled is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Designer Jamie Vartan, lighting designer Adam Silverman, composer Donnacha Dennehy and especially sound designer Gregory Clarke all do marvelous work. (Still, when Thomas is talking with his mum or other characters and their dialogue is on audiotape, I wonder why they let the ambient sound of the tape be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, they want to allow Murphy to freedom to respond to the rhythm of that particular night's performance so the audio is paused, but surely they could allow the ambient sound of the audio to continue so this would be lessobvious and let us believe more completely that the conversation is taking place? Since Murphy isn'tliterally turning an audio player on and off, that would seem to be the better choice.) But above all, there's Murphy, who I've never seen on stage before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actor -- so good in films like 28 Days Later, Girl With A Pearl Earring and The Wind That Shakes The Barley -- made his bones with Walsh and the breakthrough 1996 play Disco Pigs .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He commands the stage with authority in a very tricky role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murphy gives voice to numerous characters, interacts with audio tapes and balances betweenmadness and despair with consummate ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Misterman may be too familiar a tragedy to truly impress but Murphy and this talented team certainly present it as fully as possible, mining the story for all itsworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 The Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Godspell ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** Penn State Justice For Kelly Thomas Golf MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »Lake Water ** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** Misterman ** 1/2 The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies ** Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Once *** 1/2 Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 One Arm *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Private Lives ** Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Radio City Christmas Spectacular ** 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Seminar ** Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Silence!
