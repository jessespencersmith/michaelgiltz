                <p>W E D N E S D AY, J U N E 2 1 , 2 0 0 6How Is "Cars" Doing At The Box Office?The new Pixar movie "Cars" has grossed $117 million in ten days in theUS. (It will not open in most overseas territories for a few weeks.) But ithas been labeled a terrible disappointment for Disney since theybought out Pixar -- Disney stock has even taken a tumble because of it.They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are their arguments:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a bust because the movie dropped more in the second week than"The Incredibles," "Finding Nemo," etc. -- Everyone knows aboutlooking for the second week drop -- that is, how much a movie fell fromthe opening weekend numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reasoning? Opening weekend tellsyou how the marketing campaign and the star power worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weekendtwo tells you how the movie worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It CAN be a useful stat, but peopleare blowing it all out of proportion. "Cars" dropped more than thoseearlier Pixar movies, but it had the LOWEST second week drop of anymajor release this summer -- and since comparing stats from even 5years ago can be misleading, "Cars" ability to open solid and drop lessthan any other movie this summer is a huge positive.2. "Cars" is a flop because it is grossing less than "The Incredibles,""Finding Nemo," etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, here is another artificial comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doanalysts really expect every single Pixar film to gross more than the lastone? In ten years, they would have to gross $600 mil to keep up thatstandard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, Pixar has had an amazing run, but it is unrealistic -- tosay the least -- to expect every new release to keep setting records.Ultimately, the only standard that matters is this: how much did amovie cost to make and how much money did it take in? "Cars"probably cost around $120 mil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will gross roughly $200 mil in the USand maybe another $200 mil overseas (though that could be less sinceNASCAR is not a draw around the world).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Figure at LEAST $300 milworldwide for DVD and TV sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a total of $700 mil, notcounting merchandising, which is reportedly going very strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sounless you think every Pixar movie made should be a record-breaker,"Cars" is fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It didn't get the usual glowing reviews of Pixar movies(I'd only give it three stars out of four) and it fell below "expectations"of $250 mil, but "expecting" a movie to break records or creating theartificial standard of second weekend drops is beside the point.
