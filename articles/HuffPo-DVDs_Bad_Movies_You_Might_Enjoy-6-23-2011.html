(I"m looking at you, horribleTransformers franchise.) Still, even when you're looking for popcorn fare, you undoubtedly prefer good popcorn fare to bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why the most common question I get about new movies is whether theyshould go see it in the theater or whether it's "rentable" (they might say "Netflixable" these days) or notworth bothering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The top three movies out this week are not good by any standard, but they're almostcertainly movies many of you decided were "rentable."

THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU ($29.98 regular or $39.98 BluRay; Universal) -- The Eagle is the most offbeat of these films and benefits from being set in an unusual time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If nothing else, it's not your average bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Channing Tatum stars as a Roman soldier desperate to restore his family honor byreclaiming the golden eagle standard lost to the barbaric Britains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie Bell plays a slave whose life is spared because of Tatum after refusing to provide sport in the arena for bloodthirsty Romans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They team up to go toward enemy territory (for Tatum) and home (for Bell).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I got a kick out of Bell being calledslave (sue me) and the manly honor and betrayals and proof of courage come at regular intervals.Nothing special, but Bell elevates any film he's in and Tatum is cast well, though the cheery finalebeggars belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liam Neeson's Unknown is such a shameless ripoff of Taken you'd almost swear it's a remake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not, more's the pity, since the film is lesser in every degree to that modest B movie success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; January Jones remains the perfect Hitchcock blonde born too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling ErrorsFOLLOW US9 Signs Your Husband Is GAY, According To...PHOTOS: Kirstie Alley Makes Her Runway Debut Christina Ricci At Alexander Wang: Hit Or Miss?Keira Knightley: Sexually Dangerous Like 115K Like 87 Like 64K Like 2K Like 453 Like 2K Like 111 Like 3KFinally, I praised Matt Damon a few weeks ago, but even he's not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Adjustment Bureau is a weird, unsatisfying movie based on a Philip K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick short story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Damon is a politician who looks poised for great things but angels (or "case workers" as one of them dubs themselves) are there to make sureDamon stays on plan and avoids missteps like a romance with the wacky Emily Blunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem?Damon and Blunt feel fated to be together and keep crossing paths, despite the best efforts of TheChairman and his minions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not terribly dramatic or light on its feet a la Heaven Can Wait .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little ponderous with endless unnecessary explication, you spend the whole film wondering exactly what the filmmaker George Nolfi was going for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Damon delivered one especially goofy line, the person watching with me bursting out laughing and I said, "He's doing the best he can." He laughed some more and agreed, Damon wasn't the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, my friend pointed out, Damon did agree to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even Damon can sometimes mess with the Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have you enjoyed any bad movies lately? Confess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RAFFAELLO MATARAZZO'S RUNAWAY MELODRAMAS ($59.95; Eclipse) -- Criterion continues to mine cinema history for deliriously enjoyable collections like this four movie package of Italian melodramas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Producers looked at the worldwide success of neo-realism (which focused on the workingclass and the poor) and said, hey, why not combine that with over-the-top soapy plot twists? The resultwas journeyman director Matarazzo's biggest hits of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His muses were the manly AmedeoNazzari and the heaving bosoms of Yvonne Sanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've wached Chains , in which Sanson is plagued by a former love turned thief who pesters her for attention when she just wants to devote herself to her car mechanic husband and two adoring children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just when I thought I knew where the movie was headed, they started piling on the plot twists and turns with abandon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And over the top doesn't begin to describethe sight of her little son, arms open wide, tears running down his face and pleading with his mother notto leave their home for what he knows is a meeting with that lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't wait to watch the rest,including Nobody's Children and The White Angel, which pile misfortune on two lovers across not one but two feature films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great fun in decent prints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BIG TIME RUSH SEASON ONE VOLUME TWO ($19.99; Nickelodeon/Paramount) -- I really hate Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

Useful tip: never pick up a flight attendant while transporting a prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ROMANTIC ENGLISHWOMAN ($24.95; Kino) -- This woefully underappreciated drama features a top-notch cast -- MIchael Caine and Glenda Jackson in the leads -- a script by Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wiseman from Wiseman's book and perhaps the best reviewed work of director JosephLosey after The Servant and his cult hit The Boy With Green Hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a mystery why some movies fall off the radar. perhaps this overdue release with bring this story of a novelist fantasizing about cheatingon his wife a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like The Seven Year Itch, but smart and funny rather than obvious anddumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARPLE: THE PALE HORSE ($29.99; Acorn) -- Hmm, where to start? As just a movie, the 89 minute Miss Marple adventure starring Julia McKenzie is decent fare for those who love their British cozies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This DVD release includes another TV movie made in the 1990s from the same novel and thatstars Jean Marsh and Andy Serkis among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a nice bonus but hardly compensates for the veryexpensive price for what amounts to a single TV movie in a long-running series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've given up hopingsomeone would come to their sense and deliver the Christie and Poirot shows in some sort of reasonableorder and at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for shoehorning Miss Marple into a Christie mystery in which shedoesn't appear, well worse crimes have been committed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ONE NIGHT ONLY: THE A.I.M.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GALA ($19.95; MVD) - This curio of a concert features decent visuals and sounds, as well as some gems -- mainly Elvis Costello and Chrissie Hynde on three songs and a four song set by Chris Rea, then close to the peak of his UK fame; followed by an all-star ramblethrough some oldies led by Ian Dury, Phil Collins, Eddy Grant and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all happened because BillWyman decided to do a talent search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He went to five or so cities with professional recording equipmentto record the best bands he could find and then give them copies of the masters to do with what theycould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Royal Albert Hall concert was held to celebrate this, feature the five best bands and raise somemoney for charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of the bands made big waves, but it was a nice effort and the music's not bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abonus documentary features the performances of the five bands which were unknown then and remainso now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIVING IN EMERGENCY ($27.95; First Run Features) -- The only surprise about this critically acclaimed documentary film is that it wasn't made sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work of Doctors Without Borders is shown through this look at four volunteers -- two new recruits and two veterans and all of them dealing with the stress and rewards of providing desperately needed medical care in high-risk areas like Liberiaand the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, check out this film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, for more information on the group and its work, visittheir website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE ($39.92 regular and $49.99 BluRay each; Warner Bros.) -- As the July 15 finale of the Potter film series approaches, Warner Bros. continues tostuff and I do mean STUFF these Ultimate Editions with every imaginable geegaw you can think ofexploring the world of Potter and how these movies were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until Pottermore.com launches on July 31 with sneak peeks for a lucky few, this is where Potter fans will gorge themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UNDER THE HAMMER ($49.99; Acorn) -- The creator of Rumpole of the Bailey -- John Mortimer -- had less success with this light drama set in the world of auction houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Wilson and Jan Francis star as the appraisers at Klinsky's with a love for fine art...and perhaps each other? This set contains allseven episodes, most notable for the usual profusion of top-notch actors in guest spots offered on BritishTV, like John Gielgud, Rosemary Harris, Ian Carmichael and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MEDALLION ($17.97 BluRay; Image) -- It's not quite the home run pairing of Rush Hour, but MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Weird Animals Astronomy Food Buy a link here Sponsored Links What is Scientology Think For Yourself and Find Out for Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientology.org #1 Snoring Solution New solution that allows medical insurance to pay for remedy. www.WhyYouNeedtoKnow.com College - 100% Online Be more employable!
