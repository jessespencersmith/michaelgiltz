                <p>M O N D A Y , M A R C H 0 7 , 2 0 0 5Protecting Our Troops: How The MilitaryScrewed Upby Michael in New York on 3/07/2005 12:08:00 PMI was grousing just yesterday over the lack of follow-up articlesabout body armor for our troops -- both personal vests and thearmor needed for Humvees and other vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lo and behold,the New York Times has a massive, front page feature on themany "missteps" of the Pentagon.One order for bulletproof vests -- after a general realized hishasty decision that they weren't needed was deadly wrong --took 167 days to get moving and weeks and even monthsmore to get to the troops."By contrast, when the United States' allies in Iraq also realizedthey needed more bulletproof vests, they bypassed thePentagon and ordered directly from a manufacturer inMichigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They began getting armor in just 12 days," accordingto the New York Times.It's a pretty dispassionate article, frankly, a "how did it happen"look at the past -- despite the fact that it details career soldiersresigning in frustration, shows anti-IED electronic equipmenthas been stalled and claims that a soldier who complainedabout the lack of armor was harassed when returning to hisunit.The article also fails to answer the one questions I had:Rumsfeld was lambasted over the number of Humvees thatwere poorly armored or nor armored at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They insisted theproblem was being tackled immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what's the status?How many vehicles got the plating they need that can savelives? How many Humvees with pathetic scrap metal platinghave been replaced with ceramic plating? Are soldiers stillpaying for armor out of their own pockets?Please thank the NYT via letters@nytimes.com and push themto do the obvious followup.If you've seen the pretty good new documentary "GunnerPalace," (which gives a sympathetic look at what our soldiersare enduring in Iraq), you know it shows one soldier giving amock sales pitch for their Humvee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He describes the scrapmetal plating they've improvised as being good enough to slowdown bullets and shrapnel just enough so that they lodgeinside of you rather than going right through your entire body.His buddies literally roll on the ground laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost PoliticsThe Wrong Reporter Asks Obama A Question - Thechance to ask a question during a prime-timepresidential press conference is treasured realestate in the world of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So when thePresident...6 minutes ago Paul KrugmanProfessor in chief - I found Obama's health carepresentation so impressive - so much command ofthe issues - that it had me worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I really like apoliticians' speech, is...17 minutes ago EschatonObama Speaks - In Case You Missed It26 minutes ago Daily KosWaterloo, But for Who?
