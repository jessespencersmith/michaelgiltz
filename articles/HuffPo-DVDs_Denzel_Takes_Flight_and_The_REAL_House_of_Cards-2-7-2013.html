                <p>DVDs: Denzel Takes Flight ; and The REALHouse of Cards! Here's this week's roundup of top releases, including Oscar nominee Denzel Washington (one of Hollywood's most bankable stars), Disney's beloved take on Peter Pan, the original House Of Cards and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FLIGHT ($39.99 BluRay combo; Paramount) -- Denzel Washington is oneof Hollywood's most dependable stars.Studios love him because his presencevirtually guarantees a solid opening forany movie he appears in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics love himbecause even on his more predictablevehicles, Washington is an intelligentactor who brings complexity and charm tothe script.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiences love him becausethat's what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So he was a smartchoice to play the alcoholic pilot in theRobert Zemeckis drama Flight , a pilot whose very recklessness in his personal life may have been the key reason he was able to instinctively save a passenger airline from a truly disastrous crash with a nervy stunt literally no one else would havethought of, much less tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad he was drunk on the job and that the standard post-accident blood test will turn him from a hero to a villain in the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washingtontypically makes Whip Whitaker (what a name!) into a compelling character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But almost assoon as it begins the movie introduces cliched storylines and TV movie bromides thatsoften the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a brief exciting moment, it seems possible the movie might surpriseus with a cynical spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's only because Washington is at the helm that we enjoy this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the movie chickens out and turns to mush before our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The crash itself is effective, though I still give "scariest crash" to the Jeff Bridges drama Fearless .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSE OF CARDS UK ($39.98 DVD; BBC/Warner Bros.) -- Maybe you don'tsubscribe to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or maybe you'vealready watched the Kevin Spaceyminiseries House Of Cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do yourself a favor and dive into the original, whichhas a defining, droll performance by IanRichardson as the master politicalmanipulator Francis Urquhart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyswapped accents (British for Southern) but the stories are essentially the same in the first season, down to some sillinesswith the media that doesn't quite ringtrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, you can watch all threeminiseries in this set, figure out where theUS version is headed and seem smarter than all your friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jut the sort of thing Urquhart would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PETER PAN DIAMOND EDITIONMay 1, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 02/07/2013 6:02 pm($44.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- I know it began as a play but the novel by J.M.Barrie is the artistic peak of this uniquestory. (Truly, the novel is surprisinglywitty and will break your heart.) I've seensome tremendous theatrical productionsbut there's never been a good film versionand that includes this beloved Disney movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The animation is neither distinctive in style nor detailed, the storyis plodding and the songs are mostlygrating, with "Following The Leader"especially banal. ("Second Star To TheRight" is ok but has an ungainly melody;"Never Smile At A Crocodile" is the pick of a weak litter.) Among the voice actors, Kathryn Beaumont is a stand-out as Wendy,capturing well the sparkling personality of a girl becoming a young woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still,animation is key and it falls far short here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it's part of the Disney canon andthere's no question that they present the film beautifully here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The remastering is pristineand the extras are kid-friendly, though film buffs might have appreciated a commentarytrack from animators or historians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOUTHLAND COMPLETE SEASONS 2, 3, AND 4 ($59.98 DVD; Warner Bros.) -- Here is positive synergy in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NBC canceled this fine cop dramatoo soon, despite great reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thisWarner Bros. studio series was picked upby its own cable channel TNT, whichbroadcast season one and the sixcompleted episodes of season two topretty good ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They eventually made the numbers work (mainly by shrinking the cast) and went ahead with 10episodes each for seasons three and four.In other words, it's been almost asarduous keeping Southland on the air as a day on the job for an LA cop. (Though when you're on set only curses fly and no one's life is in danger.) The very good BenjaminMcKenzie of The OC is the heart of the show, a rookie cop with something to prove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's become a genuine ensemble, a good thing when you've got Regina King on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinceseason two was only sporadically available, consider its inclusion here a bonus feature forthose late to the game rather than punishment to those who have been supporting theshow all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Start your binge viewing now: season five begins February 13! A LATE QUARTET ($29.99 BluRay; FOX)THE POOL ($29.95 DVD; Kino Lorber) LITTLE WHITE LIES ($29.98 BluRay; MPI)ALEX CROSS ($39.99 BluRay; Summit) MADEA GETS A JOB: THE PLAY($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) -- Strongactors can't rescue a trite story of friendsgrowing older and apart in A LateQuarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, when you have PhilipSeymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener and Christopher Walken on tap, the clichespromise to go down as easily as the beautifully performed classic music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Documentary filmmaker Chris Smith capitalized on his success with American Movie to make The Pool , a passion project about a pool boy in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It maynot have broken out commercially, but itproved Smith has genuine talent and anindependent spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Little White Lies is the exact opposite: it's a flasy French drama with an all-star cast enlivening the Big Chill -like story of friends gathering together for a weekendwhere old wounds will open, secrets willbe revealed and little white lies will beexposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank goodness MarionCotillard, Jean Dujardin and Francois Cluzet are on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tyler Perry did not succeed in stepping into the shoes of Morgan Freeman for areboot of Alex Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the mere sight of him toting a gun makes you giggle, it'sprobably because you're more used to seehim as Madea, whether it's on stage (theDVD release Madea Gets A Job captures him performing live) or more likely at the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he's slowly expanded his dramatic roles and Alex Cross won't be the last time he ventures into newterritory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIDE BY SIDE ($29.95 BluRay; New Video) DIANA VREELAND: THE EYE HASTO TRAVEL ($24.98 DVD: EOne) PAUL WILLIAMS: STILLALIVE ($19.99 DVD; Virgil Films) -- Three pretty good documentaries, each one strong enough on their own if you're interested in the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keanu Reeves is not an ideal narrator for Side By Side ; his voice-overs are pure Bill &amp; Ted even after all these years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But heintroduces the general public to the interesting transition taking place inmovies from film to digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moviehas a wide scope, taking into account thedramatic shifts in editing once thatswitched to digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While 3-D may be afad, once digital filmmaking is equal toshooting on stock it will unquestionably be the dominant format for making a film, just as it already dominates specialeffects, editing and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somedirectors will still choose film just assome movies are made in black andwhite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But digital will soon be king and atmost stages already is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This filmdemonstrates the pluses and minuses ofthis inevitable shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diana Vreeland is an icon with a zest for life so anyone with a yen for fashion willenjoy her company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Williams has had a surprisingly quixotic and interesting career, as StillAlive demonstrates. it's a pity the filmmaker let Williams take over themovie and make their fandom a part ofthe story or this documentary would have been even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fan's appreciation? Not somuch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANIMANIACS VOLUME 4 ($29.99 DVD; Warner Bros.) -- Cartoons for kids get no respect, at least not right away.That may seem strange to say in an erawhere South Park and The Simpsons are TV institutions and Pixar dominatesHollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But like Looney Tunes back inthe day, shorts that are geared ostensiblytowards kids are dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Animaniacs has the anarchic DNA of Warner Bros. cartoons at its core and this final volumeof the TV series is the capper in a nutty,amusing, raucous show that will age verywell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 20 years, they'll be calling thebest of these genuine classics.***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiple combinations, including DVD, BluRay, digital download, video on demand,streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The format listedis the format provided for review, not allthe formats available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is often the mostexpensive version with the most extras.Do check individual titles for availabilityin all their various guises and pricepoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals theindustry take on entertainment news ofthe day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews andhis radio show, also called Popsurfingand also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-Rays with the understanding that he would beconsidering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does not guarantee to review and he receives far more titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz</p>
