"I want you to come see it," says Wilson while we laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as absorbing as Wilson's life story are the comments he makes about art in general and the way the show illustrates how he'll come up with a movement and then refine and repeat it over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's allperformed on a stage with Bond traversing a bare space defined by one giant square divided into ninesmaller squares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one corner Bond begins the show sitting in a chair, staring at the quart of milk sitting MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (26) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Hillcoat Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben Cardin Harry Shearer Jeffrey SachsHOT ON THE BLOG Like 102 Posted: 01/22/2012 4:10 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyGet Entertainment Alerts Sign UpSPONSOR GENERATED POST Recommend 644 Like 6k Electronic Dance Music Political Hollywood The Avengers One Direction Armchair Detective More Log in Create Accounton a table in the square at the opposite corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throughout the show Bond approaches and surveys and plays with the quart of milk and the glass originally hidden behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly not lactose intolerant, Bond has devilish fun toying with these simple elements in a formalized dance that embodies some of Wilson's approach to art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Artfully done on every level, anecdote intersects with insight; at some stages Bond as Wilson hesitates and stumbles over his words, at others he wonderfully demonstrates ideas like how the text can be divorced from movement and strengthen the impact of both and the importance of slowing things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson was profoundly influenced by a study that filmed new mothers in the act of reaching towards their baby when the child was crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At regular speed, you see a mother moving to comfort her child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slow it down frame by frame and the facial expressions and actions take on an entirely different light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mothersseem to lunge for their child in an act of anger and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a funny, fascinating tale, especially for those who know how ritualized and...measured Wilson's direction can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We hear the story and later we see Bond act it out, frame by frame and again and again we circle this story, revealing it for the turning point it became in his growth as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like that film, Bob slows down the wildly prolific artist and let's us examine him step by step, frame by frame, revealing the heart and intellect embedded in Wilson's avant-garde style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of this is presented in an impeccable production by Bogart whose every element works in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set by Neil Patel, the costume by James Schuette, the lighting by Brian H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott (with original lighting design by Mimi Jordan Sherin), and especially the soundscape by Darron L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West (which combines everything from scraps of songs by Harry Nilsson to muttering voices and orchestral passages to capure the quicksilver imagination of Wilson) each work together beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They pay the ultimate compliment to Wilson by not merelycopying his art but using it as a springboard for their own imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Bob *** 1/2 Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 The Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Close Up Space * Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Dedalus Lounge * 1/2 An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** The Gershwins' Porgy And Bess *** 1/2 Godspell ** 1/2 Goodbar * 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 How The World Began * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later *** 1/2 King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** Lake Water ** Leo *** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Lysistrata Jones * Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Maple And Vine ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast GOP Candidate Compares Pregnancy From Rape To What?
