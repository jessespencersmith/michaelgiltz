                <p>6D .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THURSDAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOVEMBER II, 2004 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA TODAY Books WWI's horrors examined through the lens of its final hours 11th Month, 11th Day, 11th Hour By Joseph E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Persico Random House, 456 pp., $29.95 By Michael Giltz Special for USA TODAY The sanest day of World War I was probably Dec. 25, 1914.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fighters on both sides agreed to a cease-fire, met in no-man's land and shook hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carols were sung in the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For those still alive some four years later, surely the craziest day was Nov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; II, 1918.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The armistice had been agreed upon early in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But despite pleas from the beaten Germans to stop the fighting, Allied leaders would make it official only at the neat, round time of II/lIon the 11th hour in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until then, everyone was urged to keep on fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result? More men were killed and wounded on the final day -most of them after the armistice had been signed - than on D-Day in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Persico, author of the ac足 claimed Roosevelt's Secret War, uses that day as the touchstone for 11th Month, 11th Day, 11th Hour; Armistice Day, 1918: World War I and Its Violent Climax, an engrossing account of "the war to end all wars." But he doesri't focus on that final day until the last quarter of the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, Persico introduces us to some of the war's participants and tells us what they were doing during the fateful hours leading up to 11 a.m. on Nov. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of the fight足 ers must have looked back at what they had been through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Persico, too, looks back at key events in their war-time experience .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He illuminates key battles in which the men fought, and he recounts their first days in the trenches as well as other telling mo足 ments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One grim question hovers over all these scenes: Had the men survived years of hell only to die in the war's last minutes? With admirable skill, Persico weaves in every facet of World War I: how it began, life in the trenches and the plague of rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He includes the poetry and the rah-rah patriotism on the home front, which contrasted with the cynical attitude in the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He avoids romantic notions of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But heroes do emerge -fam足 ous ones such as George Patton and Alvin York; lesser-known figures such as Pvt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Oklahombi, a Choktaw Indian; and, above all, the regular Tommies and doughboys who fought and died and sometimes endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may seem ironic that so many died after the armistice was signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Persico explains why the final, bloody day of World War I was not ironic or tragic -not when you know the horrors that preceded it</p>
