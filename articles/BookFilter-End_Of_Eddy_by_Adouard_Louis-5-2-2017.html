Every morning in the bathroom I would repeat the same phrase to myself over and over again . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today I'mreally gonna be a tough guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growing up in a poor village in northern France, all Eddy Bellegueule wanted was to be a man in the eyes of hisfamily and neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But from childhood, he was different -- girlish,intellectually precocious, and attracted to other men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already translatedinto twenty languages, The End of Eddy captures the violence and desperation of life in a French factory town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also a sensitive,universal portrait of boyhood and sexual awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Karl OveKnausgaard or Edmund White, Édouard Louis writes from his ownundisguised experience, but he writes with an openness and acompassionate intelligence that are all… Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say The author Édouard Louis is a 24 year old French intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That seems a reasonable designation since he's penned a scholarly work on the philosopher Pierre Bourdieu, an impassioned political cri du coeur reprinted in English by the LosAngeles Review of Books and now an autobiographical first novel already translated in more than 20 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One looks for and finds a blurb from Edmund White, which is only appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, "The End Of Eddy" does not have the emotional resonance of White's classic "A Boy's Own Story" except in spurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Louis grew up in a small village under veryimpoverished terms, battling against the constraining world in which he was born, a world that demanded he conform evenShare This Book About The Author Ãdouard Louis, Michael Lucey MoreBorn Eddy Bellegueule in Hallencourt, France, in 1992, Édouard Louis is a novelist and the editor of a scholarly work on thesocial scientist Pierre Bourdieu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is thecoauthor, with the philosopher Geoffroy deLagasnerie, of “Manifesto for an Intellectual and Political Counteroffensive,” published … Release Info List Price: $25.00 (Hardcover) Published: May 02, 2017 Publisher: Farrar, Straus and Giroux Pages: 208 ISBN 10: 0374266654 ISBN 13: 9780374266653though it knew perfectly well this feminine, girlish, high-voiced artistè, this orchid couldn't fit in no matter how desperately he tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero is mercilessly accurate and quite funny in nailing the despairing voice of the people around him, the poorly educated folk who drink themselves into a stupor at night and brawl with one another to hold at bay their unspoken, almost unrecognized despair over the misery of their brutal lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of the book feels repetitive for while Louis capturesthe voices of those around him -- often with empathy and even sympathy -- we circle the same ideas again and again.However, he's excellent at observing, at detailing the horrible "complicity" of the bullied (a complicity that is perhaps themost damaging aspect of it all).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the book springs to life when things happen: Eddy is horrified and delighted when his older cousin initiates group sex with Eddy and two other young boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He tries (and tries) to have a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the escape of an arts scholarship outside of his town (and away from the bullies) is tellingly revealed as one small step and notthe complete rebirth Eddy (and we) hope for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Louis has worked through all the insights he stored up in his young life,perhaps his next novel will embrace the narrative that powers the final third of this one. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Excellent . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already translated into 20 languages, this concise novel adroitly captures the downstream effects of reactionary rural culture, heightened by the rise of hard-right ideology and the destabilization of the workingclass in contemporary Europe, granting its reader an extraordinary portrait of trauma and escape." ―PublishersWeekly (starred review) "A seamless, universal portrait of the experience of growing up gay and gradually comingto accept oneself." ―Michael Cart, Booklist (starred review) "[One of] Europe's new literary superstars . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evenin the wake of Knausgaard and Ferrante it is hard to find a literary phenomenon that has swept Europe quite like the autobiographical project of Édouard Louis.” ―Ane Farsethas, LitHub "A bracingly pitiless account of the psychic and physical violence that lies at the root of masculine identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Louis's remarkably visceral story of growing up queer in working class France quickly transcends its setting precisely because it delivers us into it with such emotional force." ―Adam Haslett, author of Imagine Me Gone "Èdouard Louis speaks of violence, bothsocial and familiar, with tremendous force and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
