An Epic Musical -- The name made me a little wary: spoof musicals are rarely as full of easy laughs as the creators expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this garnered good reviews and the musical numbers online from an earlier workshop are appealing. 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 camille grammer lady gaga miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman pregnant raven symone weight loss More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Away For A While' Like 537 Ginnifer Goodwin Reacts to Uproar over Her Weight Watchers History READ MORE History Channel Won't Show Katie Holmes Miniseries The Kennedys READ MORE Lindsay Lohan's Post- Rehab Gift: a $25,000 Necklace READ MORE Salma Hayek's Red Bikini Stands Out in St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barts Lea Michele's Diva Behavior Strikes Again Petra Nemcova Engaged to British Actor Comments 0 Pending Comments 0View FAQ Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini (PHOTOS) Natalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie Portman Reveals Engagement Ring (PHOTOS)4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Secretaries -- How did I miss the fact that this is a Five Lesbian Brothers revival by TOSOS? That alone would have made it a good bet in my book, not to mention a description that urges, "Join this cult of murderous Slim-Fast drinking, high-heel wearing, big-haired secretaries who work the desks ofthe Cooney Lumber Mill in Big Bone, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just like your office, only with chainsaws." 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearts Full Of Blood -- One of the smartest ways to narrow down your choices during Fringe is to look for shows that have played elsewhere to good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This tense drama comes from Chicago (great theater town, of course) and strong reviews from the Chicago Tribune and Time Out Chicago .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here in New York it scored raves from the top critics, including four stars from Time Out New York and Chris Kompanek right here on HuffPo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also reviewed two shows that aren't in the Encore run: a one-man spin on A Separate Peace and Rites of Privacy, a solo showcase for actor David Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click on the links to read my full reviews. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kourtney K.'s Stunning Bikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump Bristol Palin's New RadioGig?
