Here’s a roundup of the bestnew books coming out soon and a reminder about some of our favorite theater books we toutedthis year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They make great gifts because surely everyone you know enjoys theater as much asyou do, right? If not, you need new friends! Practically Poppins in Every Way BOOKFILTER’S ANNUAL HOLIDAY BOOK GUIDE FOR THEATER LOVERS MICHAEL GILTZ | NOVEMBER 20, 2018 SHARE By Jeff Kurtti $50, Disney Editions Disney’s success on Broadway has been remarkable, from its sterling debut with Beauty and the Beast (one of the best scores of all time) to The Lion King and the current blockbuster Aladdin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little lost amid all the hits (like Aida ) and some misfires (like The Little Mermaid and Tarzan )? Mary Poppins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That sterling show is among the 25 longest-running hits in Broadway history! And now a new feature film continues the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This coffee table–worthy book by Jeff Kurtti is muchmore than a visually appealing celebration of the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It covers the history of Mary Poppinsin all her incarnations, from the beloved books by the prickly P.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Travers to the classic featurefilm that earned Julie Andrews an Oscar to its stage debut in London … and now back again tothe silver screen this December with Mary Poppins Returns (costarring Lin-Manuel Miranda)! Filled with essays and anecdotes by the likes of theater giants Cameron Macintosh and ThomasSchumacher, Disney historians, and many others, it’s the perfect setup for those eagerlyanticipating the new movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And will anyone be surprised if Mary Poppins Returns actually returns the practically perfect nanny to Broadway some day? Hardly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mad, Bad, Dangerous to KnowBy Colm Tóibín $26, Scribner Colm Tóibín is a widely acclaimed writer who broke through with the bestseller Brooklyn, a novel turned into an Oscar-nominated film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, the journalist, essayist, and critic delivers a nonfiction book about three iconic figures who loom large in Irish history and the overwhelming influenceof their fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oscar Wilde, W.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeats, and James Joyce are the artists Tóibín tackles,showing how the love (and often lack thereof) from their fathers and the careers those patriarchspursued shaped the talents we know so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three have varied links to theater. “The Dead,”Joyce’s final story from his collection Dubliners, is turning into a holiday perennial via a staged production in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest is the first among many popular plays by him that have taken a permanent place in the repertory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyoneinterested in these talents or simply fascinated by the push-and-pull of fathers and sons will findmuch to mull over here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearts UnbrokenBy Cynthia Leitich Smith $17.99, Candlewick Maybe the premise of this young-adult novel will sound outrageous to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Hearts Unbroken, Louise Wolfe is a proud Native American teen living in a mostly white middle-class Kansas town.When her little brother is cast as the Tin Man in the school’s production of The Wizard of Oz,well, that sounds great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as a journalist on the school paper, Lou (as she’s known) findsherself covering backlash to the director’s inclusive casting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A protest group called ParentsAgainst Revisionist Theatre is soon speaking up, anonymous threats are flying, and the kids inthe cast are bearing the brunt of long-buried animosity and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yikes! But don’t worry:Lou finds the time to develop a romance with the school paper’s photographer, even if it can betricky to “date while Native.” If you find yourself wondering how author Cynthia Leitich Smithcame up with such a crazy idea, you might check out recent news stories from North Carolina.Parents in Mitchell County held a prayer vigil after a high school performance of the lightcomedy The Complete Works of Shakespeare (Abridged) shocked them with its references to alcohol consumption, suicide, and a queer kiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, not so crazy! (And Hamlet, we’re guessing, will not be mounted any time soon.) Defying Gravity, 2 Edition ndBy Carol de Giere $29.99, Applause Books Composer-lyricist Stephen Schwartz gets the full biography treatment he deserves in Defying Gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, this new paperback edition covers his entire career, along with added material about Schwartz’s work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (which is proving very popular in high schools and regional productions, despite never making it to Broadway), the animated film ThePrince of Egypt, and his ongoing work on new productions of Wicked all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Carol de Giere expands on a section where Schwartz discusses practical issues in a self-helpsort of way, such as how to overcome a creative block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also delves deeper into his earlycollaboration with Leonard Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From Godspell to the ever-in-the-works feature film version of Wicked (it’s coming! someday!), Schwartz is one of the most successful composers of all time, and this biography is the place for fans to start getting to know him in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Secrets of Noh MasksBy Michishige Udaka $25, Kodansha USA For 600 years, Noh drama has been a radically simple mainstay of Japanese theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is acting pared down to its essence: Actors, minimal props, and Noh masks all work in concert to tellstories with nuance and a remarkable range of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s enjoying a new peak in popularity,and who better to discuss it than Michishige Udaka, the rare talent who both acts and crafts hisown Noh masks? Most Noh masks are precious and antique works of art, handed down fromartist to artist or kept as key resources by legendary theatrical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Udaka is the onlyperson to teach, write, act, and craft his own Noh masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This gorgeous book showcases some30 masks in all their beauty and subtle range of character, along with his insights into both thecraft of making them and acting with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For fans of Japan and serious theater buffs alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Notes on DirectingBy Frank Hauser and Russell Reich $17.95, RCR Creative Press An essential work for anyone interested in theater at any level, be it high school, community theater, academic, or professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longtime teacher and director Frank Hauser collaboratedwith former student Russell Reich to distill Hauser’s insights about his craft into a series of notes.It’s all here: notes on casting, handling a first read-through, rehearsals, notes on how to givenotes, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might be tempted to see his clear-eyed notes as useful advice inmany settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You’d be right, but this is more how-to than self-help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s vital, however, foranyone who wants to collaborate on theater in any way and lets fans peek behind the curtain atall the work that goes into the shows they will eventually enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most everyone in theater saystheir favorite period is rehearsal — the period when they’re getting a new show onto its feet —so why not find out exactly what’s going on? Leonard Bernstein 100: The Masters Photograph the MaestroBy Steve J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherman, with Jamie Bernstein $40, powerHouse Books Leonard Bernstein was born in 1918, so this entire year has been dedicated to celebrating the famed conductor, composer, and popularizer in countless ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a man who made such avisual impact as the very embodiment of the conductor/teacher on TV, one particularly apttribute is this coffee table book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It celebrates Bernstein as captured on camera by a range ofbrilliant photographers, and it is a visual treat for theater and classical-music buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among thegiants who shot Bernstein and are included here: Richard Avedon, Henri Cartier-Bresson,Gordon Parks, Ruth Orkin, and Stanley Kubrick (!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution By Todd S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purdum $32, Henry Holt &amp; Co This brisk and lively biography of the greatest team in musical-theater history happily remains focused on what matters most: the shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Todd S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purdum begins by covering their livesand careers up to that fateful partnership, reminding us that Oscar Hammerstein (Show Boat ) and Richard Rodgers (Rodgers &amp; Hart) had already accomplished enough to be rememberedforever even before they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Purdum devotes about a chapter to each major work and theincreasing business activity that surrounds colossal success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rodgers and Hammerstein werethe boldest and most fascinating of talents, pushing boundaries on what stories a musical couldtell, how they would tell them, and doing it all with songs that are so precise and deceptivelysimple that everyone can sing them — yet, in the right hands, they reveal passionate depths.Purdum doesn’t shy away from the personal, including Hammerstein’s insecurities, Rodgerschasing after showgirls, or battles with depression and alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it’s always in the contextof how personal matters affected their relationship and their shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something Wonderful doesn’t rock the boat with any unexpected claims for this show or damning of that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a solid, affectionate description of artists who look more important today than at anytime since, oh, 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Then We Danced By Henry Alford$26, Simon &amp; Schuster Henry Alford is this generation’s Bill Plimpton, a writer who dives into a topic by actually diving in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, Alford tells the story of the history of dance while sharing his own experience of usingdance lessons to boost his confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part popular history and part memoir, you get thumbnailsketches of artists such as Twyla Tharp and George Balanchine along with the origins ofeverything from tap to ballroom to swing and even Zumba. (Alford wrote a hugely popular articlefor The New York Times about taking Zumba lessons, which led to this book.) By the time he’s dancing with Alzheimer’s patients as part of their therapy, you’ll be laughing and tearing up atthe same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read it before the heart-tugging film version does a tango with Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our July Pick Of The Month: read the full review here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Theatre Wing: An Oral History By Patrick Pacheco $45, Graphic Arts Books Author Patrick Pacheco was tasked with the duty of sharing stories celebrating 100 years of the American Theatre Wing, and thus 100 years of American theater, from Broadway to Off-Broadway and regional scenes all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, no single book — however thick— could do justice to it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with never-before-seen photos and anecdotes from a who’s whothat includes Angela Lansbury, Harvey Fierstein, Audra McDonald, Harold Prince, Patti LuPone,Neil Patrick Harris, and so many others, well, you can hardly go far wrong, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nate Expectations By Tim Federle $17.99, Simon &amp; Schuster Tim Federle’s best-selling and beloved series about a middle-grade kid besotted with theater comes to an end with the third and final volume of the triology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nate didn’t find fame and fortunewhen the show E.T.: The Musical bombed on Broadway, so he’s back in his hometown in Pennsylvania… and his freshman year of high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’d rather be rehearsing his Tonyspeech (who wouldn’t?_, but the out-and-proud Nate instead decides to oversee a musicaladaptation of Great Expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sweet and open to all orientations (as long as you love Broadway), the Nate series shows that everyone loves a dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing to the GodsBy Peter Rader $26, Simon &amp; Schuster This dual biography tells the stories of two of the greatest stage actresses in history: Sarah Bernhardt (the Divine One, as good at self-promotion as she was at acting) and Eleanora Duse(a self-effacing artist who pioneered modern acting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s juicy and delightful, so anyone wholoves theater, acting in general, and strong women from history in particular will enjoy Playing to the Gods very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our September Pick Of The Month: read the full review here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dear Evan Hansen: The NovelBy Val Emmich, with Steven Levenson, Benj Pasek, and Justin Paul $18.99, Poppy This has to be the most anticipated theater book of the year , a young adult adaptation of the show with writer Val Emmich building on the book, music, and lyrics of Steven Levenson and the team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Has a Broadway show ever been turned into a YA novelbefore?
