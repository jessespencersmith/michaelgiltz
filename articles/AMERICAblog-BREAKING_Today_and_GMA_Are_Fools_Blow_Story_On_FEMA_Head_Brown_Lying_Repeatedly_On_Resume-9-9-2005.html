                <p>F R I D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 0 9 , 2 0 0 5BREAKING: Today and GMA Are Fools -- BlowStory On FEMA Head Brown Lying RepeatedlyOn Resumeby Michael in New York on 9/09/2005 12:50:00 PMIt seemed like a slam-dunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time magazine did all theinvestigating: FEMA head Michael Brown lied REPEATEDLY onhis resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did NOT have experience overseeingemergency services for the city of Edmond -- Brown wasbasically an INTERN and had no oversight of ANYONE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He alsolied about being a college professor and garnering a top awardfor his work as a professor at the lowly Central State University-- Brown was only a STUDENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather bizarrely, Brown alsoclaims that for the past 22 years he has been a director of thenursing home in Edmond called Oklahoma Christian Home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noone there HAS EVER HEARD OF HIM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My God, how much moredamning does it get? So I jsut watched the stories on themorning talk shows about what I assumed would be the finalnail in the coffin for Brown.So what do "Good Morning America" and "Today" do? Theyblow it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diane Sawyer lets the Time reporter who broke thestory give out the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But instead of wrapping up withsome natural comment, like "Gee, this raises serious questionsabout Brown's credibility," Sawyer says, as if the story isnitpicking, well what does all of this really mean anyway? Shealso quotes FEMA people who say Brown is "disappointed" inTime magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll bet he is.The Today Show is FAR worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrea Mitchell (who botchesher live intro while stumbling over her own words) files a storythat begins with Brown's lies on his resume -- facts thatoverwhelmingly contradict virtually every portion of his resumeand most fundamentally undercut Brown's LONE CLAIM to anydisaster relief experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mitchell quickly makes this partof a larger story about who is to blame for the disaster and theresponse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Why does a story about Brown's NUMEROUSLIES on his resume morph into a story about who is to blamefor the incompetent response to Katrina? The White Housecouldn't have asked for a better clouding of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brownlies on his resume and "Today" cuts right to Mayor Nagin ofNew Orleans and criticizes him for not doing a better job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'msure he could have done a better job and frankly I could careless if the people of Louisiana throw out both Nagin and Gov.Blanco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what the hell does that larger, complex story haveto do with Brown lying repeatedly on his resume? Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talkabout the blame game.The capper? The Today Show repeats the lie that the WhiteHouse is pushing about Gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blanco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blanco declared astate of emergency on the Saturday before Hurricane Katrinastruck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sent an official request for government help thatvery day to President Bush (dated Sunday) and stated that thedisaster was likely to be beyond the scope of city and stateofficials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush declared a state of emergency on Sunday and --according to FEMA's own website -- they should take charge atthat point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The White House lied to the Washington Postand Newsweek, who repeated Bush's lie that the Governordidn't ask for help until after the storm -- even though anychild with an internet connection can confirm it's not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bothran corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what does "Today" say after shifting the Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's crew ofRescue Rangers were vcmvo2, grog, dopper0189,shayera, and joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, dadanationlooked editorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh yeah, a big shout ...18 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsPalin's Next Step Is Still A Mystery - Sarah Palinwill enter uncharted political waters when sheleaves the Alaska stage Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the questionis whether she will go on to become...18 minutes ago EschatonLate Night Thread - Enjoy1 hour ago FiredoglakeLate Night: MSNBC – Will Any RepublicanDenounce Rush Limbaugh? - I sure do remember atime when the GOP made Barack Obama denounceJeremiah Wright, insisting that if he didn't it wasan explicit endorsement of anything W...1 hour ago Crooks and LiarsC&amp;L's Late Nite Music Club - Friday Night Ripoffswith Green Day and Chicago - Title: Brain Stew vs.25 or 6 to 4 Artist: Green Day vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chicago Chicago- 25 or 6 to 4 Green Day - Brain Stew This is thethird post in a series called ...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: BRE...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/breaking-today-and-gma-... 1 of 57/25/09 12:27 AMShow AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Visit our AMERICAblog TV site.see all 329 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod Southern Poverty LawCenter calls on CNN to A two minute explanationof the warped and cynical The economy is better.But....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge order San Diego toget rid of the seals Massive brawl in SouthKorean parliament Mormons may havesecretly baptizedNext 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: BRE...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/breaking-today-and-gma-... 2 of 57/25/09 12:27 AMEzra KleinTab Dump4 hours agoWonk RoomF-22 Killed BySeven-Meme Voltron5 hours agoNYCeveHuge victories: Maloney&amp; Pingree - Health CareHeroes, Clyburnreceives petition - video5 hours agoDaily DoseWill Doctors in theHouse, SenateInfluence Debate?6 hours agoThe TreatmentDoes the GOP ReallyHave an AlternativePlan in the Works?6 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
