Glass could have focused on his childhood, before the musicstarted in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, he does a little bit of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He offers upanecdotes from his youth, like how he smashed unsold LPs so they could be returned asdamaged goods, and recalls how during his first audition for Julliard as a flutist, Glass wasstopped and told, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt really want to play the flute, do you?‚Äù; he honors the teachers whomolded him through fear (Nadia Boulanger) and love (Ravi Shankar); and he remembers beingbroke after the sold-out success of Einstein .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mixed in here and there are Glass‚Äôs still-scrappy defenses of his music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure to be enjoyed by admirers, it‚Äôs probably too discursive to win Glasssome new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want a good musical introduction to his work, see the film Koyaanisqatsior buy the album Glassworks .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
