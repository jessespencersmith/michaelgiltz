Author Pamela Katz — who scripted the praised film Hannah Arendt — also gives full due to the women who played signature roles in the birth of these works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because frankly, the cabaret of our dreamswouldn’t be half as memorable without the contributions of actresses Lotte Lenya, Helene Weigel, and writer Elizabeth Hauptmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Murder, as well as co-owner of the Palace Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lane is also anincreasingly ambitious chronicler of theater history, and his new bookcelebrates and explores the story of African Americans on the Great WhiteWay, as its subtitle puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black Broadway works in two ways: It is profusely illustrated and can serve as a handsome coffee table book, but it’s also deeply researched andcan be intensely read for the text alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It journeys from minstrel shows to the present day, and theater buffs will enjoy this chronicle of a vital element in Broadway history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COLLECTED PLAYS OF ARTHUR MILLER Edited and Introduced by Tony Kushner($115, Library of America) Any shortlist of America’s greatest playwrights includes Arthur Miller’s impressive body of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

As proof, look to London, where the great Antony Sher is tackling Death of a Salesman for the Royal Shakespeare Company in a landmark production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, the Library ofAmerica has collected his plays in a handsome three-volume set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Glass might have focused on one keyevent in his life — such as the original mounting of Einstein on the Beach or an eye-opening journey to the East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He might have delivered his thoughtson classical music and the best way a would-be composer should preparefor a career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glass could have focused on his childhood, before the musicstarted in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, he does a little bit of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He offers upanecdotes from his youth, like how he smashed unsold LPs so they could be returned asdamaged goods, and recalls how during his first audition for Julliard as a flutist, Glass wasstopped and told, “You don’t really want to play the flute, do you?”; he honors the teachers whomolded him through fear (Nadia Boulanger) and love (Ravi Shankar); and he remembers beingbroke after the sold-out success of Einstein .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mixed in here and there are Glass’s still-scrappy defenses of his music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure to be enjoyed by admirers, it’s probably too discursive to win Glasssome new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want a good musical introduction to his work, see the film Koyaanisqatsior buy the album Glassworks .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’re already a fan, rest assured you’ll enjoy Glass in what ever mode he holds forth here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.THE B-SIDE By Ben Yagoda($27.95, Riverhead) The songs of Broadway were the songs of popular music for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then abruptly, in the 1950s, it stopped almost overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of popular musicbeing dominated by Berlin, Gershwin, and Porter, people started gobblingup Elvis Presley and nonsense like “How Much Is That Doggie in theWindow?” What happened? Author Ben Yagoda explains it all in this culturalhistory that explores events like the battle between ASCAP and BMI, theimpact of TV, and Frank Sinatra’s feud with Mitch Miller, showing how theyshaped and changed the songs that America danced to and sang along with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yagoda showshow the arrival of the 78rpm format helped shape and refine songwriting, explains why jazzexploded and evolved after World War II, and much more in a critically acclaimed work that willbe fascinating for anyone who loves the Great American Songbook and wonders why it is frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALANCING ACTS By Lucy Gray and Hilton Als($24.95, Princeton Architectural Press) Think being a ballerina is tough?
