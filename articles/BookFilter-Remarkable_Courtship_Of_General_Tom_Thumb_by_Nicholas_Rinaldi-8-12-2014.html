But timeand again throughout this picaresque tale, Thumb merely registers as one more person and not a terribly interestingor insightful one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIs life was too rich to keep this novel from being actually dull, but Rinaldi never quite brings him tolife and the background -- Lincoln, Walt Whitman, the war, Queen Victoria -- remains far more vividly etched in yourmind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor Tom Thumb is overshadowed in his own tale. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
