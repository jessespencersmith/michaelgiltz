                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , M A R C H 1 6 , 2 0 0 5US Military: A Lot More Prisoners Were KilledIn Custody Than We Thoughtby Michael in New York on 3/16/2005 01:20:00 PMOk, so today the military says that -- so far -- 26 prisonersmay very well be the victims of homicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's 400% higherthan the figure it gave to Congress just one week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oops."Only one of the deaths occurred at the Abu Ghraib prison inIraq, officials said, showing how broadly the most violentabuses extended beyond those prison walls and contradictingearly impressions that the wrongdoing was confined to ahandful of members of the military police on the prison's nightshift," per the New York Times.So today we find out that along with raping, sodomizing,torturing, and humiliating prisoners of war in violation ofinternational law, US law, and common decency, we've beenkilling them as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And we've been killing a lot more of themthan we'd been led to believe.Yesterday, we found out that Halliburton has ripped off theAmerican people by war profiteering and overcharging for thefuel it provided. (In one case, it paid $87,000 for a shipment offuel and charged the American people $27 MILLION -- nowthat's a markup.) And we just found out that the total amountof money it garnered was a LOT higher than we'd been led tobelieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the report detailing this was hidden from Congressand the American people until after the election.So what other numbers will turn out to be wrong, as the truthcomes out? Some possibilities:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll find out the number of civilian deaths in Iraq is muchhigher than previously reported.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll find out (again) that the number of insurgents andtheir allies is much higher than previously thought.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll find out that the cost of the war and occupation willcontinue to be much higher than previously thought/4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll find out that Bush's dismantling of Social Security willcreate a debt load that is much higher than previously thought.Any other suggestions?
