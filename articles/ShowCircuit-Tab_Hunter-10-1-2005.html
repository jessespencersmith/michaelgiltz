                <p>BORN ARTHUR GELIEN IN NEW York, Tab Hunter has been a teen idol, pop star, an acclaimed actor, and now­ with the publication of Tab Hunter Confi­ dential: The Making of a Movie Star-he can probably add best -selling author to his resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his book, Hunter talks about his storied career, in­ cluding the film version of Damn Yankees, being a gay actor in private, and his renown as "The Sigh Guy" who was swooned over by girls in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What this 74-year-old icon wants to talk about most, how­ ever, is the true love of his life: horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He recently did just that with Show Circuit's Michael Giltz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOW CIRCUIT @ When it comes to show jumping, legendary leading man Tab Hunter is the real deal-and yes, he performed his own equestrian stunts on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interview by Michael Giltz Story produced by Diedre Johnson Photographs by Harry Langdon for Show Circuit ". l~ • Hunter aboard Sign Painter, 1970 FAlL 2005 Show Circuit: You have said that you prefer horses to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: Horses have been my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've been my touch of reality in an unrealistic world. sc: Horses also tie into your Hollywood mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it true you were discovered in a stable? Hunter: I was shoveling you-know-what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a stable boy at the Dubrock's Riding Academy in California when I was about 12 [when he met Dick Clayton, James Dean's agent].lt was across the street from the Horse Palace, where I went to my first horse shows and I fell in love with hunters and jumpers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd hitch out there on the weekends as a kid with my girlfriend Mary Lou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I worked as a stable boy just so I could get extra money to ride. sc: How did you fall in love with horses in the first place? Hunter: My brother got me started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had a brother who was eleven months older, and he opened that world to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was kind of frightened of everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was just an idiot kid, and he really exposed me to the love of my life-horses. sc: Did he just ride for fun? Hunter: Oh yeah, he was into all sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My mother was always encouraging us to do things like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said, "You've got to ex­ pose yourself to so many different things throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just don't live in a shell:' And of course it was difficult because I was living in a shell. sc: Why do you think you were good with the horses? What was your talent? Hunter: The communication was terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then when I was sneaking across the street to the Horse Palace, the hunters and jumpers became my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, I loved them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I went to work for a man by the name of Rudy Smithers who had a one-eyed paint horse called Rex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I used to ditch school, and that's how I got to see all the people like Barbara Worth [Oakford], Clyde Kennedy-all the big guns of the show circuit in those days. sc: How long have you known George Morris, the new chef d' e­ quipe for the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Show Jumping Team? Hunter: I've known George since he was a junior rider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, George and I used to ride together whenever I would be back East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember one time we were riding in Long Island and he was riding a little bay horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said, "Tab, they want to put this horse on the team, but I don't know." I said, "I don't know, Georgie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's awful good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's terrific." And it was the horse that Billy Steinkraus won the gold on called Sinjon. sc: Do you know Frank Chapot? Hunter: I know Frank, but not real well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But of course his wife Mary Mairs-I knew Mary in California because we used to all show horses [together]. sc: What did you love about hunters and jumpers? Hunter: The jumpers I found very exciting because there's such an incredible communication between horse and rider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Going around courses with fences was fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it's totally different today with all the FEI rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then it was just touches and out, and knockdowns and faults. sc: The showmanship? Hunter: Not so much the showmanship; it was the marriage of horse and rider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some horses were spectacular. sc: I think the first film where you rode was probably 1953's Gun Belt, which was about your third film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: Yeah, I did ride in that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's when I met Jack Con­ nors, one of the top stuntmen in the business who also used to go on the horse show circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wife Kay and I have become very, very close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had horses with Jack and Kay for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was the first one to tell me, "Look kid, they've got a double out here to do a lot of that stuff you want [to do].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let the double do the job and SHOW CIRCUIT § FAlL 2005 you can go in for the close-ups, and then you're not cheating that guy of a paycheck!" 1'd never even thought about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: You were always gung-ho to do your own stunts? Hunter: Oh yeah! It was like playing cowboys and Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next film I rode in was The Burning Hills with Natalie Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had a chestnut mare I'd bought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She'd been green jumper champion at Del Mar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mare was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her name was Swizzlestick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was a bit of a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had a cyst on her ovaries that didn't make her very pleasant. sc: That would make anyone cranky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: [laughs] Finally, when The Burning Hills came along, I told Jack Warner I wanted to use her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was told the studio didn't use mares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I used her and she was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, she was so good, I used her next in a film called Gunman's Walk, which is really a good film that's totally slipped through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then I used her again in They Came To Cor­ dura with [Gary] Cooper and Rita Hayworth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swizz turned SHOW CIRCUIT out to be a damn good movie horse. sc: Why didn't studios use mares? Hunter: I guess they could get a little mare-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They mostly used geldings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: There's no end to the people in Hollywood who are seri­ ous about horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Shatner, Betty Buckley, and so many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: We used Bill [Shatner] in our TV special Hollywood on Horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Probably the most knowledgeable about horses was [director] John Huston, who had been Master of the Hounds for the Galway Blazers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So we spoke about horses a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Fred Astaire had race horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: Was being a serious horseman helpful in keeping rumors at bay in Hollywood about being gay? Hunter: I hated the press because they were always so unkind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geraldine Page grabbed my arm once and said, "If people FAlL 2005 r HOLLY\i\ OOD I-IORSEIVI AN don't like you, that's their bad taste:' I said, "Gerry, I will never forget that:' And I think that's something that everyone can apply to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I believe that very strongly. sc: Did you ever help a fellow actor learn how to ride? Hunter: I helped Natalie a little bit before The Burning Hills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had a little fear of horses; she wasn't crazy about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I took her to Clyde Kennedy's, and we rode a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: You just found her the right gentle horse to get her started on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all about the ABCs and getting a person comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're so right about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: We've got some shots of you jumping in a show without a helmet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Were helmets optional when you started competing? Hunter: No, they weren't ... no, they weren't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helmets are very important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, in those days we did a lot of things dif­ ferently [laughing].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We also didn't have perfect distances going down to our fences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't five strides down to so-and-so and six across to here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was more by-the-seat-of-your-pants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: How was the horse Coach that you showed? Hunter: Coach was a good horse; he was a tough horse ... very difficult; he was either on or he was off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He didn't belong to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I showed him for some people that owned him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had done a lot in Canada and done quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he was on, he was very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he was very inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: In your memoir, you talk about some of the people in Hol­ lywood you were very close to, like Anthony Perkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What horses were you particularly fond of? Hunter: There were a number of horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had a horse called Collector's Item that I showed in California that I bought out of Chicago, where my friend Katie Lindsay is a steward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She called me on this horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I flew there in the middle of the night, jumped him, was very impressed, and bought him on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He won the first class he was in, and everyone wanted to buy him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I sold him to my friend Joan on the condition that I have first right of refusal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was a very, very good horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As far as hunters, I had a horse called Sign Painter that was nice-very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: I'm sure you remember the first horse you were able to buy from your earnings as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was down at Del Mar with our group from the barn, and I was grooming and riding but not showing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clyde found this one bay horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, my friend Maggie got drunk at a beach party and wound up in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw her and said, "Mag­ gie, what are you doing here?" She said, 'Tm out on bail." And I said, 'Tm going to call my next horse 'Out On Bail;" and I did! SC: Of the actors you worked with or knew, who was the best rider? Hunter: Without a doubt, Linda Blair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Collector's Item's first show in California SHOW CIRCUIT 8 FALL 2005 i'i - ~ ~ :r: ... n ,- !" ... '0 ~-f 8 At the Santa Barbara Horse Show (I.-r.): Diane Grad, George Morris, Tiffany Traurig, Hunter, and J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spread in a 1950s fan magazine Hunter (I.) doing his own stunts in Gunman's Walk, 1958 Riverside County Fair SHOW CIRCUIT ® FALL 2005 I-lOLl JY\\TOO)) I rOltSE~I"\ N SC: We know some of the highlights of your movie career- 1955's Battle Cry, 1958's Damn Yankees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What are your person­ al highlights of your riding career? Hunter: Gosh, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having a horse that went on to the Olympics was nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had a horse Nob Hill-I didn't show him; I wish I had-but Max Bonham showed him back East and won the Cleveland Grand Prix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobby was a good horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Win­ ning at the Cow Palace was quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was also a judge with the AHSA in the 1970s and also did some riding clinics at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, I go to the shows, and it's fabulous that we have such quality horses and the horsemanship has gotten so much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we're still not up to where Europe is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I lived in Europe, I used to go out [to ride 1 all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I was in Egypt, I would ride in the Egyptian cavalry, and I'd ride in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was fabulous to see how they were doing and what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You learn a lot seeing the way they work their horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm so pleased now that George [Morris] is the chef d'e­ quipe of our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's like me-we're very dramatic and have very hard heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: So he'll be able to inspire the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: Oh, no question about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's always a pleasure to run into George.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: Your current horse Harlow, what breed is she? Hunter: I wasn't riding for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had a horse Mark My Word that I sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did very well with my godchild; he shows a lot in the Grand Prix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now, Harlow .. .I came to Santa Barbara and my friend Ann had horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were nice horses, but they were not my kind of horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this paint mare named Spot just took a liking to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was so funny, she made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I started to ride her and she broke me up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She'd see me and start nickering and come running to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd say, "Sweetheart, you're not the kind of horse I really like." But she loved me, and I started taking a liking to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when my friend Ann was still alive, I thought maybe we could breed this mare and give Ann something to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We tried to get the horse bred, and it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann passed away and left me Spot, and the next stud I liked, I bred the mare to him and got a fabulous baby by him that I named Harlow, and it looks just like the mare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spot was just one of those happy horses that made you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, she colicked, and we oper­ ated on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next day she was fine, and I was happy to see her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then she took a turn for the worse, and we had to put her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broke my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She really won me over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who is to know what will or will not work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got to try them and play with them and have fun with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: In Hollywood, you have people trying to win you over constantly, and you can never know who you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: I was pretty fearful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: It must have been a relief to know when a horse was trying to win you over that you didn't have to worry about their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunter: That's very true ... very true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter how hard you want to make it work with a horse, if it isn't meant to be, it isn't going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: How often do you ride these days? Hunter: I don't ride that much at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I rode a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I ride once in a blue moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: Did you ever feel you could ride as much as you wanted? Hunter: I never could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I was in England, I used to ride a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I was on a film, I would hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anneli Drum­ mond -Hay was a dear friend of mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She'd won at Badminton [Horse Trials] in 1963, and then she turned into a show jump­ ing rider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anneli was fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, it was her aunt that raised whippets, and that's when I first fell in love with whip­ pets. [Hunter owns two whippets, Olivia and Katie.] SC: Did the agent Henry Willson pick Hunter or did you sug­ gest that? Hunter: Actually, there would be no Tab Hunter if it weren't for Dick Clayton, my closest friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I met him when I was a stable boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's 90 years old now and was an agent for Jimmy Dean, Jane Fonda, Burt Reynolds, Angie Dickinson-the list goes on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's like my brother, my father, my mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he was still an actor, he took me to my first Broadway show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dick introduced me to Henry Willson because he wasn't an agent at the time. "We've got to tab you some­ thing;' is what Henry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Dick said, "Well, he rides hunters and jumpers." So I always say it could have been Tab Jumper instead of Tab Hunter! SC: If you could go back and do anything differently, what would it be? Devoting your life completely to horses? Hunter: At one point, I was ready to give up Hollywood and go back to Virginia and horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SC: This was in the '70s? Hunter: This was in the '60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Horses were so im­ portant to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I learned a lot about people from being around my horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wasn't comfortable around people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was comfortable around the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star (Algonquin; $24.95), by Tab Hunter with Eddie Muller, was published Oc­ tober 14 and is available in bookstores nationwide. • by TAB HUNTER lNith EDDIE MULLER SHOW CIRCUIT § FALL 2005</p>
