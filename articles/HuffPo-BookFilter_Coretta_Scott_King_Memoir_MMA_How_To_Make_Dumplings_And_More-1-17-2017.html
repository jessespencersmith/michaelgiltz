Welcome to our latest Top Picks Of The Week ! It's inauguration week so whether you want to celebrate, get informed or escape from the headlines, what better way than to dive into a book? We've discovered a gem about a woman of a certain age taking a late night stroll, an expos√© of Edward Snowden, a warm biography of Coretta Scott King, a sci-fi anthology about far-flung empires and a great cookbook that can turn you into an expert dumpling maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh and more tempting titles in every genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share this with a friend you know who would love our pick for the next Le Carr√© or the sweeping historical fiction about nurses in WWII! And when you're headed to your favorite bookstore, library or online retailer, head first to BookFilter and you'll discover all the best new releases in every genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What we're reading: LILIAN BOXFISH TAKES A WALK by Kathleen Rooney (fiction) HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS by Edward Jay Epstein (current events, true crime) THE BELIEVER by Joakim Zander (thriller) MY LIFE, MY LOVE, MY LEGACY by Coretta Scott King (biography, history) GALACTIC EMPIRES edited by Neil Clarke (sci-fi) THE DUMPLING GALAXY COOKBOOK by Helen You (cookbook) THE FIRE BY NIGHT by Teresa Messineo (fiction, romance) BEAST by Doug Merlino (sports/recreation) BookFilter: Coretta Scott King's Memoir, MMA, How To Make Dumplings And MoreÔÑºLILIAN BOXFISH TAKES A WALK by Kathleen Rooney In ‚ÄúLillian Boxfish Takes a Walk,‚Äù author Kathleen Rooney sets her delightful character on a reflective, autobiographical journey through the landmarks of her life in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the highest paid woman copywriter in the country with her job at department store R.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macy in the 1930s, Lillian Boxfish had everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the novel opens, she is in her eighties and her knees don‚Äôt work so well anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is New Year‚Äôs Eve, 1984 and during this evening‚Äôs walk she will barter with a mugger over her fur coat, attend a party in a rundown artist‚Äôs loft where she feels like an exhibit out of a wax museum and sit down to dine with a family of complete and rather boring strangers at Delmonico‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who enjoys a wonderful story should also be happy to take a walk with Lillian Boxfish, one of the most delightful and witty characters to emerge in years....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Fiction? Discover More Here ! *************** HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS by Edward Jay Epstein Edward Jay Epstein's new investigation of Edward Snowden is a useful corrective to the knee-jerk hero worship that the most famous whistleblower/traitor of modern times has inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By focusing on the timeline of what Snowden did when, Epstein strongly suggests that intentionally or not, the hacker-turned-activist handed over a wealth of intelligence info to Russia, an enemy of the US, and compromised its ability to track terrorists and other rogue groups, at least over the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the very best, it's a sobering reminder of the risks even a well-intentioned whistle-blower is taking with the fate of nations when they seize access to literally millions of highly sensitive documents and take them overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Current Events? Discover More Here ! Love True Crime? Find More New Releases Here ! *************** HOLLYWOOD'S HOTTEST WRITER? RUDYARD KIPLING!" The Oscar nominations will be announced on January 24 and at BookFilter, that's both a national holiday and a good reason for setting an alarm. (Hey, we read late into the night so we can find more great books for you!) One name sure to be celebrated is Rudyard Kipling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His Mowgli stories known collectively as "The Jungle Book" were adapted into a hugely popular Disney movie by "Iron Man" director Jon Favreau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In true Hollywood magic, this live-action movie features a young boy alongside talking animals in a realistic jungle setting...but it was all shot on a set in downtown Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the film isn't recognized in various tech categories, that outburst of dismay you hear will be from our headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, a sequel is in the works,.Plus Andy Serkis (the actor who played Gollum) has a competing version due out in 2018 and there's even an adaptation of Kipling's poem "If" being prepped in Chile! If you've never read "The Jungle Book," here's a beautifully illustrated edition worth checking out. *************** THE BELIEVER by Joakim Zander Author Joakim Zander says he was a lawyer for the European Union in Brussels and Helsinki, but he sure has the resum√© of a spy! Born in Sweden, he has lived in Israel and Syria, went to high school in the US and earned his law degree in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ok, at the very least he sounds glamorous, a fact that didn't hurt sales of his debut thriller "The Swimmer." Now his stand-alone sequel (you don't have to have read the original) is earning similar critical acclaim and great buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Virtually every thriller writer around working at a certain level of intelligence gets the "next Le Carr√® tag," which is about as useful as a singer-songwriter being called the next Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But taken as a badge of honor that the writing is smart and a cut above, the reviews show that's an honor Zander has earned....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Thrillers? Discover More Here! *************** MY LIFE, MY LOVE, MY LEGACY by Coretta Scott King As so often happens, it wasn't until many years after Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King's assassination that the importance of Coretta Scott King began to be fully appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An accomplished woman, she was at first the classic example of "behind every great man...." By founding the Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Center For Non-Violent Social Change, protecting and extending his legacy to other struggles for freedom and speaking out in measured and passionate voice as a leader of the fight for civil rights to whom attention must be paid, Coretta Scott King showed the mettle of the person standing by his side for all those years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Towards the end of her life, King opened up to Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barbara Reynolds and the result is this memoir "as told to" which can provide inspiration to people of faith, people of color and anyone wanting to share in an amazing story.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Biography? Discover More Here! Love History? Discover More Here! ***************GALACTIC EMPIRES edited by Neil Clarke Empires rise and empires fall and no genre loves their sweep and scale and (often) battered glory more than science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acclaimed editor Neil Clarke has brought together a collection of tales depicting empires of all types and at all stages in their history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For those who want their sci-fi on a grand scale or who need an example of how sci-fi isn't usually predicting the future but depicting the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Authors include classic names like Robert Silverberg to current best-sellers Naomi Novik and Brandon Sanderson and some fresh new talent like Ann Leckie....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Sci-Fi? Discover More Here! *************** THE DUMPLING GALAXY COOKBOOK by Helen You The BookFilter headquarters features many take-out menus but no cookbooks -- we can barely be trusted to heat up left-overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why we love giving cookbooks to our friends so THEY can prepare great dishes. "The Dumpling Galaxy Cookbook" is our new favorite, springing from a hole-in-the-wall shop in Flushing, Queens to wide fame thanks to raves in the New York Times and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Owner and chef Helen You walks you through every step of how to make dumplings and we're ready to sample them and clean up the dishes when you're done....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Cookbooks? Discover More Here! ***************WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS, IT'S ALWAYS 1984 Author George Orwell was so insightful and smart that he is eagerly claimed by people on the left and the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orwell died on January 21, 1950 and whether you think he would have covered the inauguration on January 20, the marches on January 21 or both, you'll find something to savor in his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of Orwell's best is "Homage To Catalonia," a memoir about his experience reporting on the Spanish Civil War and then fighting against the Fascists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's self-deprecating and somehow both passionately idealistic and bitterly pragmatic at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That helps explain his lionization by both socialists and National Review, which named "Homage To Catalonia" one of the ten best nonfiction books of the century. (His collected essays are also in the Top Ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many have you read? ) *************** THE FIRE BY NIGHT by Teresa MessineoSometimes the copy writers at a publishing house really know how to hook us: they call this debut by a Reading, Pennsylvania novelist a "Band Of Brothers" for nurses and that and a clutch of early strong reviews by critics and readers has us eager to dive in. "The Fire By Night" spans from Hawaii to France to Manila, from before Pearl Harbor to after the war ends, all while staying focused on the friendship of two women that can't be broken by war or being a world apart from each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, we could wait for the movie or miniseries, but why? You know the book is always better....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Fiction? Discover More Here! Love Romance? Discover More Here! Love History? Discover More Here!*************** BEAST by Doug Merlino Sometimes a book slips past us in hardcover and we discover it in paperback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the case with this real-life look at four men looking to become champions in the brutal and hugely popular world of mixed martial arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Doug Merlino embedded with four people ranging from a Bosnian refugee to a middle-aged fighter enjoying a burst of celebrity to a one-time Olympic wrestler, all of them training in the same Florida gymand struggling to make it as a professional athlete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But only one of them will fight their way to a championship bout....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Sports &amp; Recreation?
