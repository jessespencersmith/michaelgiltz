Would she get along with the other judges? As Ellen herself says, she may not be a music industry professional but she certainlyknows a thing or two about entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To me, she's the stand-in for the fan who watches at home and thinksthey could pick a winner too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though in interviews Ellen suggested she found Simon a bit abrasive (to the contestants), none of that was visible tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She joined the panel very smoothly, offering up criticisms andcomments with the wry humor that comes so easily to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll have to wait for some fireworks or head-butting tosee how she does down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But so far, Ellen was a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, we watched singers step up in groups of eight and perform a number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I won't say I took pleasure in seeing people go home when I questioned them getting a ticket to Hollywood in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would be mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But having my initial impression reinforced by seeing them sent packing certainly made me say, "See, I knew it." But itmust be painful for folks like the Italian dude with a big family or the beatboxer or the two sisters from Jersey who all got plentiful airtime for their auditions but are now at home watching just like us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So to flip it, let me focus on three people who didn't wow me in their auditions (or didn't get a chance to) but did much better here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASEY JAMES -- This is the guy who sang for about two seconds in his audition but spent most of his airtime taking off his shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon said it was embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Here he sang "I Don't Need No Doctor," a modest hit for Ray Charles and covered recently by John Mayer (and co-written by Ashford and Simpson; who knew?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey played someserious blues guitar and was a lot more winning than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He definitely made the most of his Hollywood shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARY POWERS -- This 28-year-old mom looked too much like a Pat Benatar wannabe in her audition (and copycatted Benatar in her vocals too much) for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, there's something to be said for maturity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike so many of the kids (who looked like deers staring at headlights), she came on stage with quiet confidence and beltedout Pink's "Sober" with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still needs work on her look but she won me over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRYSTAL BOWERSOX -- Another audition that went by so quickly I wasn't sure what to think (though I did enjoy her laid-back spin on "Piece Of My Heart").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here she strummed acoustic guitar and sang Carole King's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" with such winning charm that the kids in the audience spontaneously sang backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very, very winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest who got through were either new to me or reconfirmed the impression they made in their auditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KATIE STEVENS -- Very confident, no frills rendition of Stevie Wonder's "For Once In My Life." ANDREW GARCIA -- A very cool, Raul Midon-like spin on Paula Abdul's "Straight Up." We'll be hearing this arrangement again, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing an instrument is definitely a help, if you're good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two skills are always more impressive than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JANELL WHEELER -- Sang Estelle's "American Boy," also accompanying herself on guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HAELEY VAUGHN -- This was a bit iffy for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She played the guitar okay and was quite sharp on her vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very rough performance and yet I still kept thinking she was pretty darn cute and winning. (The giggle at the end helped.) Torn between putting her through another day on personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cute but not great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges probably felt the samething but she'll have to get over her nerves and deliver or this is as far as she'll go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LILLY SCOTT -- Sang "Lullaby Of Birdland" and played the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very Madeleine Peyroux and quite charming. (Lose the earrings, though.) Pegged the tune as by Ella Fitzgerald, which of course prompted me to look up authorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't know the music was by George Shearing! (Lyrics by George David Weiss, who also co-wrote "What A WonderfulWorld") Blossom Dearie had the biggest chart hit with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Lily did great by the tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a comer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL LYNCHE -- The personal trainer, Michael performed while his wife was potentially in labor with their first child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One assumes and hopes the birth went as smoothly, for Michael sailed through with a rendition of John Mayer's "Waiting On The World To Change." Not quite sure why Simon found it inventive since it sounded just like the originalto me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not quite won over yet, but he was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIM URBAN -- Cute kid who did not do a good job with David Cook's "Come Back To Me" but got through anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So that's it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wednesday is the dreaded group night, my least favorite section since someone can get torpedoed by the shenanigans of some loony in their group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did anyone catch your eye tonight or convince you they had more than you first expected?

If there's any belief it would diminish the need to watch the show, they're crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's like thinking someone buying Dylan bootlegs won't bother buying his official studio releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That sort of fanatic fan is exactly the sort of person who will always watch the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But commenting on all of the performances we did see is moot since they started naming people into the Top 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, we saw seven go through and two sent home, which means Idol wants to keep it positive or we're gonna see a lot of tears Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here are the ones who got through and my thoughts on whether they deserved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One note on song selection: for their final song, some people sang offbeat choices like Boston's "More Than A Feeling" and the Commodores classic "Brickhouse." So I ASSUME people had a fairly wide range of songs to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why do so many of them singMichael Jackson's "Man In The Mirror" and that Jason Mraz song "I'm Yours?"

She really needs to lose this backstory; it may be personally upsetting but in this day and age it hardly represents a stumbling block in life in any shape or form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHELBY DRESSEL -- No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the girl who sings out of one side of her mouth and insists that anyone watching should not worry about perceived problems and just be themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the snippet of her singing "More Than A Feeling" was not good; she was off a bit, which is too much atthis stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never expected her to make it this far, which means it was a real shocker when she was senthome and Simon said, "That was the wrong decision." Cold comfort but still something she should savor. (And hey, audition for The X Factor next year, Shelby.) CASEY JAMES -- Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dude who took his shirt off as proven a real talent to me and an obvious lock for the top 24, as clips of his performances reinforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even his "weak" performance of Colbie Caillat's "Bubbly" seemed good to me and a sign of versatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like him more every time I see him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AARON KELLY -- Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This 16-year-old kid has a good voice and is very appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he screwed up two out of three performances during Hollywood Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group song was a disaster and he forgot the lyrics on his final solo number. (Though he recovered and stumbled through in a way that somehow seemed endearing.) I would have sworn he would benefit from another year or two of growing up before coming back but they put him through on the strength of his voice and innate appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Understandable,but maybe not the best for him long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEE DEWYZE -- Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very appealing personally but he was another one whose montage didn't show the trajectory of a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not quite sure why he got through, but of course the judges saw more of him than we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TODRICK HAL -- Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dancer who never took a singing lesson made it through despite being the gazillionth person to sing that Jason Mraz song, though happily with a lot of style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His performing career as a dancer should hold him in good stead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JESSICA FURNEY -- No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was off-key and sharp at moments in the performances we caught a glimpse of but argued strenuously that she was ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe most improved from last season (though not improved enough) but her hunger almost convinced me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, Michael Lynche and Casey James were obvious picks and look likely to sail into the Top 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither of the women have impressed so far and the rest of the men are wild cards of one sort oranother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From what we saw, I'll be shocked if Angela Martin, Thaddeus Johnson, Siobhan Magnus and Crystal Bowersox don't make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What did you think of the judges' picks and rejections?
