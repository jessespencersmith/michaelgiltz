Here are my impressions of two revivals: one Broadway and one Off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRIVING MISS DAISY ** out of **** Golden Theatre on Broadway When they announced a Broadway revival for Driving Miss Daisy, my first reaction was, Why? Then I saw the cast: Boyd Gaines as the son, and Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones in the leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's like bringing baseball's American League All Stars to a little league game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may seem an unfair reaction to a Pulitzer Prize winning play that went on to score Academy Award for Best Picture (andthree more, including Best Actress).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So writer Alfred Uhry can take comfort in that when I say timehasn't been kind to the movie or the thin play that produced it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many theatergoers, I'd be happy to see this cast in anything that interested them, but I'm afraid even they can't bring much substance to the MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Movies | Gwyneth Paltrow | The Kardashians | Bristol Palin | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP LIVE UPDATES: Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords Shot, Federal Judge KilledGet Breaking News by Email SHARE THIS STORY Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 2 Democratic Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot, Federal Judge Killed At Public Event Comments (9,610) Suspected Arizona Shooter Identified: Disturbing YouTube Videos, MySpace Comments (9,018) Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Comments (1,031) Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Comments (195) Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

Worst of all, the car scenes (originally, I assume, handled just by placing a bench and a chair on stage and letting the actors convince us they were in a car) are here brought to life by having the bench and chair spin around slowly, turning left and right and doing a gentle 360 degree turn as if we need to beprompted into understanding what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the very modest charm of what was essentially a two- hander (or rather, three-hander) is spoiled by even this mild jazzing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That tells you how fragile the charm of Driving Miss Daisy was in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others said: Ben Brantley of The New York Times praises Redgrave and Jones in general as giants, of course. "They give responsible, intelligent performances that are infused with two old pros' joy in the mastery of their craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they pull off the deft trick of registering as big as we want them to be without making the play in which they appear seem even smaller than it is." Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News said, "But even the one-two wallop of Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones can't make Alfred Uhry's one-act more than it is - a wispy middle-of-the-road 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift 1 of 9 jwoww naked miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant snooki nude More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss Comments (532) Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton Joins Future In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp; Vanessa Hudgens Back On? READ MORE Willliam and Kate's Love Story There's No Viral Video Like 'Home' Michelle Williams on Keeping Heath's Memory Alivefamily drama fueled by sentimentality." Elisabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post said, "The whole point here is the leads, and they bask in the spotlight without ever appearing to hog it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result isn't so much a clash of the titans as a delicate, respectful rubbing of elbows." That ole softie John Simon of Bloomberg News raved, "With three great actors -- Vanessa Redgrave, James Earl Jones and Boyd Gaines -- at their apogee, the enchanting revival of "Driving Miss Daisy" is the best theater can be." David Finkle of Theatermania said, "There's little doubt that Driving Miss Daisy is not just about a vehicle; it's a vehicle in the old theater sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when stars such as this trio dispense their charms and craft this well, audiences will be only too happy to go along for the ride." WINGS ** out of **** Second Stage Theatre Unlike Driving Miss Daisy, this Off Broadway revival of Wings benefits from a sleek beautiful production that makes the most of the Second Stage space to bring this tone poem of a play to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Written by Arthur Kopit, Wings seems like a story scripted by Oliver Sacks: a woman (Jan Maxwell) has suffered some traumatic injury and can barely decipher what is happening to her in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whenshe begins the road to recovery, this one-time aviatrix spends her days in group therapy with other patients who have trouble verbalizing the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They need to be prompted for the word for virtually everything: elbow, the corner of the room, each other, themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's exhausting andfrustrating and -- it is hoped -- beautiful in how it reveals the way we see the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caryl Churchill might have witty fun with this conceit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this show exhausts us, with the first 10 or so minutes a barrage of strange images, doctors and nurses repeatedly asking the patient to say simple things and our heroine's fractured delivery of her mind's confused impressions. it settles down during the group sessions, led by Amy (January LaVoy) who is so patient and understanding it's quietly maddening. (One of the show's surprises -- to me -- was that our hero Emily didn't snap at Amy.) When Emily discovers that actually touching things (like snow) helps her to verbalize what she is seeing, I think for a moment we're going to explore this and gain a powerfulmetaphor for handling words and physically grasping the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this insight leads nowhere and we revert to more discontinuous verbalizing, with Emily slowly circling around the accident that led her to this place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show is only about 66 minutes long and throughout we've understood that she is a stunt woman of sorts, a wing walker who literally went out onto the wings of planes (the show is set many years ago, Iassume).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When she finally describes in somewhat more detail the accident itself and her feeling of release when flying, the climax doesn't pierce the way it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure whether to fault the play, actress Maxwell (nominated for two Tonys this year) or the production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I doubt it's director John Doyle and his technical team, who create a beautifully fluid world combining impressive visuals that never oversell the flying metaphor and an intricate sounddesign that holds your attention when the story becomes too repetitive and nonspecific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fails to take flight? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But mostly I'm left with the impression of talented people working together to tackle a tricky little piece that can falter at the slightest lapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others said: Ben Brantley of The New York Times said, "An elegant but uninvolving production." Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News said, "In the end, "Wings" is a play that's easier to admire than to enjoy and more than a little unsettling."

John Simon of Bloomberg News points out that the role was originally intended to be a woman in her 70s and said, "If age does not so much matter here, Doyle's casting and staging unfortunately do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maxwell is a wonderful actress, but vulnerability, essential to Kopit's portrait, is not her strong suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the end, neither cast nor production erased my fond memory of the original." Andy Propst of Theatermania said, "A bravura performance from Jan Maxwell and a top-notch production by director John Doyle combine to make Arthur Kopit's 1978 play Wings, currently being revived at Second Stage Theatre, one of the first "must-see" productions of the fall." ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How lucky some New Yorkers are to be able to see two great actors in any play, even this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh absolutely .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's why I live here.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Recency | Popularity Rozanna 11:27 AM on 10/28/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:14 PM on 10/28/2010 Permalink | Share itComments are closed for this entry View All FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright Â© 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.</p>
