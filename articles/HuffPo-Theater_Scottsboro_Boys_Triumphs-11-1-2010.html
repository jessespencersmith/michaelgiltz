As a minstrel show, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Led by a white master of ceremonies (the wonderful John Cullum), the nine young men sing and dance their story, with an assist from two stock vaudeville performers, Mr Bones (Colman Domingo) and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tambo (ForrestMcClendon), who also play other roles like the jailers, the lawyers and the such with broad, winking style.The stage is set off by three giant, rusting steel frames that suggest the train the men were riding on and the tilted reality they must endure in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A dozen chairs are provided for the cast, which become supports for wooden planks they sit on to mimic the train ride and are later stacked up to serve as the jailcells they're stuck in for so many frustrating years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This setting is boldly theatrical and plays to the strength of Kander &amp; Ebb: their ability to offer up a rousing or touching number that can peer into the darkness at the heart of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what numbers: the opener "Minstrel March"/"Hey Hey Hey Hey" is pure razzle dazzle, with Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bones and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tambo even offering up flat, intentionally obvious jokes to punctuate the singing and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience Isaw it with was a little confused and overwhelmed at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They knew how serious the subject was.Exactly how entertained were they supposed to be? Should they laugh? It's the same tension Kander &amp; Ebb mined when revealing the rise of Nazi Germany or celebrating women who offed their men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swiftly and with precision, we get to know the men, ranging from two brothers to a little boy to the strong, unwilling to bend Haywood Patterson (a standout Joshua Henry).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're just riding the rails and searching for work during the heart of the Depression (the charming "Commencing in Chattanooga")when two white women threatened with imprisonment for also riding the rails accuse the nine men of raping them. (The women are played hilariously and to great effect by Christian Dante White and James T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lane, who also portray two of the Scottsboro Boys.) What follows is a tale of frustrated hopes and despair, all softened somewhat by the witnessing presence of The Lady (Sharon Washington), who we easily spot as Rosa Parks. (That's not just a theatrical deviceto link the Scottsboro Boys to later developments in the struggle for basic civil rights for blacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rallies were held all over the country to spotlight this injustice and at one rally sponsored by the NAACP in 1931, then Rosa McCauley met her future husband Raymond Parks.) Of course, presenting it all as a minstrel show is a constant reminder of the racism that underlies everything that happens to the men involved. (And boy, since one of them is only 13 at the start anddoesn't even know what rape is, making the claim even more absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeremy Gumbs handles the rolewith the same multi-talented aplomb as everyone else.) John Cullum's presence as the Interlocutor helps tremendously as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's an avuncular, seemingly friendly presence, who calls them his boys and encourages them to wow the crowd with this or that shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cullum is engaging but also shows his age; he is 80 years old after all The show deftly lets him be at the heart of many musical numbers but never hides the fact of his relative frailty compared to thevibrant cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a hopeful, positive note in a subtle way: Cullum's character is literally part of the distant past, out of step with the present and clearly a relic. (The actor of course, remains a vibrant talent we trust will be around for many years to come.) It's one of the show's many brilliant sleights of hand how the performances of the Scottsboro boys range from the full-on enthusiasm of the first number (though we sense something is off-key) to more andmore reluctant as the show goes on, climaxing with a blackface routine when they wipe off the makeupand resolutely refuse Cullum's entreaties to do the Cake Walk and smile the way people love to see 'em.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This tension is captured most perfectly when Cullum exhorts the boys to sing one of the oldies and they 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS jersey shore jwoww naked miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman pregnant snooki nude More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com PHOTOS: Raven-Symone's Dramatic Weight Loss Like 720 Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE Kate Middleton Joins Future In-Laws at Weekend Wedding READ MORE BUZZ: Are Zac Efron &amp; Vanessa Hudgens Back On?

Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News said, "It's exciting to see "The Scottsboro Boys" on Broadway boasting so many things a musical should have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That includes good songs, a provocative story (not from a movie), a rousing staging and a hugely talented cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also has a split personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wants to shock; it yearns to charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're not always compatible goals...isn't perfect, but it's worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It deserves credit for tackling a slice of history that needs to be known." Elizabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post said, "John Kander and Fred Ebb have given American musical theater a pair of un disputable, stone- cold classics, "Cabaret" and "Chicago." Now they've added a third one to the list: "The Scottsboro Boys," which opened last night on Broadway....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can'tseparate the songs from Stroman's staging, a model of visually striking economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She needs only chairs, tambourines and a few other props to evoke a variety of locales and situations, including a chain gang and an electric-chair execution....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet this is also a thrillingly inventive and entertaining night at thetheater."TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift Kourtney K.'s StunningBikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER NFL House Of Representatives Facebook Video Gun Control iPad Haiti Earthquake Atheism Sarah PalinHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESOne And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,236 Comments Esteemed Film Critic Group Picks The Year's Best Movie 9 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,032 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 109 Comments Ashton Kutcher: Training, Paranoid About Real Life 'End Of Days' 904 Comments Bill Murray Crashes Stranger's Karaoke Party 66 CommentsOlivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini (PHOTOS) Natalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie Portman Reveals Engagement Ring (PHOTOS) 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed For Second...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments 10 Pending Comments 0View FAQDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said, "In an age when institutional racism endures in more veiled forms, this bold musical keeps you tapping your feet while it socks you with an emotional punch to the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a tough combo for mainstream commercial acceptance, but it makes for arresting theater." Jeremy Gerard of Bloomberg News said, "Unveiled last spring in a smashing production overseen by director-choreographer Susan Stroman, "The Scottsboro Boys," seemed an unlikely candidate for transfer to the commercial arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here it is anyway, subtly but smartly retooled, in the intimate Lyceum Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still smashing, and it's still shocking....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is wrenching and the songs rank with Kander and Ebb's most gorgeous." Andy Propst of Theatermania said, "And now more than ever -- thanks in part to some judicious tweaks from director-choreographer Susan Stroman and the replacement of three cast members -- The Scottsboro Boys grabs audiences as soon as the members of the ensemble burst down the aisles of the theater and never lets go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audacious, troubling, and yet strangely entertaining work tells the true story of nine men falsely accused of raping two white women on a train traveling through Alabama in 1931 within the framework of a traveling minstrel show, led by the white Interlocutor (a winningly smarmy John Cullum)." Elyssa Gardner of USA Today said, "In short, Scottsboro, which opened Sunday at the Lyceum Theatre, wears its social conscience and its political incorrectness on its sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while the result is thoughtful, vibrant entertainment, the earnestness and irreverence can seem self-conscious." ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE : Michael Giltz was provided with free tickets to the show in previews with the understanding that he would be writing a review of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Related News On Huffington Post: Blackface Sparks Controversy At Lehigh Two white male students, who attended what appears to be an off-campus Halloween weekend party, blackened their faces and arms while wearingtennis clothes and...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Recency | Popularity sumur 04:35 PM on 11/30/2010Comments are closed for this entry View All 5 Fans 185 Fans 38 Fans 277 Fans 59 Fans 277 Fans 0 Fans 59 FansI saw the show in early November and was blown away!
