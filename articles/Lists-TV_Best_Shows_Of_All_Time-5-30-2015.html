                <p>Newer Post Older PostSATURDAY, MAY 02, 2015 Best TV Shows Of All Time -- The Master List Here's a rundown of my favorite TV shows of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a mishmash of everything: dramas, comedies, TV movies, miniseries, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everything here is scripted; reality TV and game shows and news magazines like "60 Minutes" and talk shows are an entirely different beast. (If you're wondering: David Letterman, Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson and Craig Ferguson.) As of October of 2014, some 300+ new and ongoing scripted shows are airing on the major networks, basic cable, premium cable, satellite and websites such as Amazon and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's just in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Literally no one can watch it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any more than one person can read even a smattering of the 100,000 books published a year worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then you have all those shows that need to be watched again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exactly how well does "The Wonder Years" hold up, you wonder? So this list is a never-ending process and if your favorite show isn't on here, maybe I haven't seen it yet (or at least not enough of it) or maybe I feel I need to really re-watch it before deciding or maybe, just maybe, I don't like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, you'll find some shows here you've been thinking of trying or ones you've never heard of and give them a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to streaming and BluRays and On Demand, classic TV is always ready and waiting to be rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What follows is my master list of the best TV shows of all time, followed by some current shows that are too soon to call, the shows I've never seen or feel the need to rewatch before deciding on and then a breakdown of best shows by category like drama, comedy, miniseries, documentary and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy!
