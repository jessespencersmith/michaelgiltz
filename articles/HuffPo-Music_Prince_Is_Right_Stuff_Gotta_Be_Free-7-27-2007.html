(Have I missed the annual gatherings, the newsletter?) Instead of paying $171.50 for the full cover price of 57 issues, instead of paying thestandard subscriber rate (whatever that may be), I'm being offered a full annual subscription ... for$10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten dollars? That's less than 18 cents an issue-- even with bulk rates, will that even cover thecost of mailing it? In short, EntertainmentWeekly is practically giving itself away for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How soon will it be before they offer to sendme the magazine for nothing? Prince is right, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gave away his new CD to readers of the UK paper the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not for free, really -- the paper is paying Prince a chunk of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it works out great: thepaper gets a ton of publicity, their readers get a free CD, Prince gets a guaranteed amount ofmoney and reaches fans who might never have bought one of his CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That can only encouragethem to buy a ticket to one of his shows, and buy a t-shirt or other merchandise, the areas whereartists have made most of their profits for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's worth more to Entertainment Weekly to practically pay me to take their magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They get to announce a higher circulation and more eyeballs mean higher rates for their ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course a lot of those ads are from Time Warner, the company that owns "EW." When they want to promotetheir movies or TV shows or CDs in their own magazine, they naturally like to have as many peoplereading it as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can already read lots of Entertainment Weekly content for free on their steadily improving website , just like you can read much of the New York Times and countless other publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they're giving it away online, why not give away the print edition too? For years, newspaper subscriptions have mostly just paid for the cost of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real profits come from ads, notfrom forcing people to pay for a print edition of something they can get online for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

And from their point of view, why force you to pay for a newspaper or magazine of whatever when if you read it, they'll make more money off their ads? Twenty years from now, major magazines like Time and Entertainment Weekly will give themselves away for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People will subscribe to music databases the same way they subscribe to cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big companies and little artists will make their money one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you want the new Prince CD, all you'll have to do is go online and ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prince knows that just means more people will pay to go to his concerts -- one experience that can't be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments for this post are now closed Email Print More in Media...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Buy a link here Sponsored Links Degrees for Working Moms Find a Flexible Online Degree Program to Fit Your Needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial Aid www.moms.yourdegree.com Refinance Rate Drop to 4.60% FIXED!
