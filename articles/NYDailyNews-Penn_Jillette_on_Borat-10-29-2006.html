                <p>The controversial movie "Borat: CuI­ turalLeamings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakh­ stan," co-written by and starring British comic Sacha Baron Cohen (aka lV's Ali G), is a faux documentary , opening Friday, about a Kazakh lV reporter trav­ eling the U.S. to learn our ways (and he hopes, maybe many Pam Anderson) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government of Kazakhstan has expressed concern about the fictional Borat (r.) '~representing'" its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some ac:tivist groups worry-that the mov­ Ie's button-pushing on race, gender and sexuality will be seen as encouraging, in­ stead of spoofing , prejudlce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And some of the people interviewed by Borat in the film say they didn't realize he was mak­ ing a comedy when they expressed or agreed with outrageous c·omments .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But one thing isn't being discussed: Baron Cohen's goofball skill in a movie that industry bible Variety has already called "uproariously funny." Penn Jillette, of the comedy duo Penn &amp; TeUer and one of the forces behind the documentary "The Aristocrats, " agrees. , All anyone is talking about are the things other people say in the film," says Jillette. ''What I think should be talk- ed about, really, is what a fabulous actor Sacha is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would watch 'Borat' without anyone being pranked in it.' The kick is the difficulty level in Baron Cohen'S performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The improv in films like "Best in Show" or the , upcoming "For ~G Your Consider- . ation" comes from actors riffing togeth- '. er, in a standard mOviemaking ~--­ style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the "Jackass" guys provoke a response with physical stunts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baron Cohen's goal was to provoke a re­ sponse, be funny, stay in character and never lose the confidence of the peopJe he "interviewed. " And to do it all in one take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So while much of the movie's humor comes from Borat talking to frat boys. a rodeo official and experts on man­ ners (all of whom react with increduli­ ty or cheerful agreement to Borat's rant­ ings) , there is a whole other hlgb-wire act happening on screen -though JiI­ Jette thinks some people in the film may have caught on to the joke. "People love to put each other on in the U.S.," he says. "While they may have been trying to get along with Borat, they may also have just wanted to have a good time. r think it was America that may have taken Borat for a little ride." •</p>
