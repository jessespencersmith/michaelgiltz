Posted August 29, 2008 | 05:25 PM (EST) Read More: Animation , Barack Obama , Dvds, Horror , Movies, Presidents, TV Shows , Entertainment News You know it's coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever happens in November, a TV movie and/or feature film aboutthe life of Barack Obama will be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So whoshould play Obama? The Daily Show -- in a mock biography of Obama -- suggested one of the actors from the old sitcom What's Happening?Other possibilities: Dule Hill from The WestWing and Psych ; Tristan Wilds from 90210 and The Wire; or the great Adrian Lester from Primary Colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What do you think? And while you're thinking, check out some politically themed DVDs out the last two weeks. (Hey, Iwas caught up in the Olympics and the convention, so I've got catching up to do.) AmericanExperience: The Presidents ($129.98; PBS/Paramount), an excellent boxed set pulling together 10 documentaries on 20th century Presidents, from Teddy Roosevelt and FDR to Reagan and Bush Sr.Sober, thoughtful, documentaries, they make absorbing viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, the BiographyChannel has put out Biography: John McCain and Biography: Barack Obama ($12.95 each; A&amp;E), both of which are less than an hour, perfunctory and far less insightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone expectingmuckraking from director Oliver Stone's upcoming biopic on Bush Jr. -- W , due out in October -- should check out Nixon , just out in an extended cut with 28 extra minutes ($29.99 and $34.99 on BluRay; Hollywood).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony Hopkins was a bold choice and the movie is far more complex andempathetic than you might expect. (I would prefer they include the original cut as well, of course;people shouldn't have to choose.) W will probably be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, if you do want muckraking, there's always Robert Greenwald, who makes shoddy, haphazard documentaries likeThe Real John McCain ($9.95; Disinformation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever your politics, shouldn't his documentaries look more polished than something a high school student might have tossedtogether and posted on YouTube? It does provide good red meat for the already convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If youwant to get riled up, try Recount ($19.98; HBO), HBO's comic look at the Florida recount in 2000 with an all-star cast having a hoot, led by Kevin Spacey, Laura Dern and Tom Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

($24.95; Genius), a comic journey around the world with Spurlock asking anyone and everyone if they know where Bin Laden is hiding? (Spoiler: the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan is an awfully popular choice.) Spurlock's wife deserves a medal for letting him galivant around the world while she's pregnant and he does try to stretch himself, but it basically makes you appreciate how good Moore is at what he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linda Lovelace was good at what she does, too, but she wasn't very happy about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, one of the artifacts of her fame is Linda Lovelace For President ($14.98; Dark Sky), a 1975 B-movie about Lovelace hoping to "go down" (their words) as the first female President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It drags in everyone from Scatman Crothers to Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees to little purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For politics of the past, Chicago 10 ($29.98; Paramount) is a genre-bending animated movie about the trial surrounding the '68 Chicago Convention that went a lot less smoothly than Obama's in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, House Season Four ($59.98; Universal) woke up a show slipping into formula with an election of its own as House put a passel of candidates through their paces while he decided on a new team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other DVDs now out: Action/Adventure Flicks: In Street Kings ($29.99; Fox), Keanue Reeves delivers his patented, stolid performance as a detective who finds himself betrayed and facing violence on all sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'll play better on DVD than in theaters -- and like more and more titles, this one comes with a freedigital copy you can download to watch on your computer or iPod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starship Troopers 3: Marauder($27.96; Sony) is another direct to DVD sequel to the underappreciated Verhoeven sci-fi satire,with Casper Van Dien back as Johnny Rico and a lot of bugs, it's for hardcore fans only and alsocomes with a free digital copy to download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brotherhood of the Wolf Director's Cut ($19.98; Universal), an overheated French costume action flick that proved they could make boneheadedgoofy action flicks just like the US (and of course, it's longer and padded with hours of extras).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ifyou're looking forward to the new Nicolas Cage action movie, check out the lovably over-the-topPang Brothers original it's based on: Bangkok Dangerous ($9.98; First Look).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More direct to DVD action arrives with The Scorpion King 2: Rise Of A Warrior ($29.98; Universal) in which RandyCouture plays the young warrior who will one day morph into Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson andhow sad to see it's directed by the talented Russell Mulcahy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve McQueen knows action and cooland proved it on the way to becoming a star in Never Love A Stranger ($14.98; Republic) one of those standard tales of two boyhood pals where one becomes a cop and the other a criminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AndTony Jaa of Ong-Bak is the hero of these B-movie action flicks about a bodyguard and called, reasonably enough, The Bodyguard and The Bodyguard 2 (both movies on one DVD ($26.98; Magnet) and no Whitney Houston does not sing the theme song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family Movies: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas Collector's Edition ($32.99; Disney) looks better with each passing year -- and in this case it's because they've sharpened the striking look of the film to match Burton's original vision closer than ever and you also get a digitalcopy for your computer and iPod and loads of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a genuine classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Chow is anenjoyably wacky director but his cuddly alien movie CJ7 ($28.96; Columbia) is a little too sentimental and family-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He made better family entertainment when he wasn't trying, as withShaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevy Chase certainly didn't intend to make family films but I think his goofy Fletch movies as collected in The Fletch Collection ($19.98; Universal) are perfect for older kids and parents to watch together -- kids love disguises they can see through and Fletchhas a million of 'em.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Transformers Animated: Season One ($26.98; Paramount) contains MOST of the episodes from Season One (you need to buy another DVD to get the other three) and it'sONLY in cropped, full frame when the show is also available in widescreen -- why not make bothversions available in one set and make it complete? Bakugan Battle Brawlers Vol. 1 ($14.98; Warner Bros.) contains five episodes from a new animated series I haven't caught up with yet.Much gentler -- and clearly for younger kids -- are three other releases: Where The Wild Things Are($14.95; New Video) contains six Maurice Sendak tales read by Peter Schickele and others; Bob TheBuilder On Site: Houses &amp; Playgrounds ($19.98; Lionsgate) mixes animation with real-life construction sites because kids LOVE giant dump trucks; and Curious George Sails With ThePirates ($16.98; Universal) contains eight episodes from the PBS series with George all over the place but mostly -- I like to think -- trying to get away from the Man in the Yellow Hat, who isalways giving George up to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And kids can rock out to Hannah Montana and MileyCyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert and Camp Rock ($34.99 each on Blu-Ray or $29.99 on regular DVD; Disney), both of which -- OMG -- feature the Jonas Brothers and with the HannahMontana movie even includes four sets of glasses so you can watch it in 3-D.

He keeps piling up the anonymous hits, like What Happens In Vegas with Cameron Diaz ($29.98; Fox) and eventually he'll start getting credit for them. (This is ANOTHER movie that provides a free digital copy you can watch on your computer and iPod and so on; hopefully soon this will become so standard it won't be worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is Ed Burns a bankable director? He keeps making commercial flops like Purple Violets ($19.98; Weinstein) that costars Debra Messing, Selma Blair and Patrick Wilson that come and go in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are The Three Stooges funny? Check out The Three Stooges Collection Volume Three ($24.96; Sony) and if you like slapstick these shorts will make you say yes. (And if you want to know if someone is gay, ask them if they like The Three Stooges or show them one of these shorts -- gay people just don't get 'em.) Is Mischa Barton naked? The Three Musketeers-style costumer romp Virgin Territory ($26.97; Anchor Bay) stars Hayden Christensen and Mischa Barton and has a sticker on it with silhouetted strippers that says it's part of the Anchor Bay "Unzipped" collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That'll get some people renting it and skipping through the flick to find the naughty bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when will someone make a new feature film out of The Lone Ranger? The 1981 flop The Legend of the Lone Ranger ($14.98; Lionsgate) was stillborn, but boy did they find an unknown with a classic 50s movie star name: Klinton Spilsbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It won't be long before someone remakes it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serious Entertainment : Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis ($29.95; Art House Films) is an acclaimed documentary about the New York photographer and performance artist who inspired Warhol; Twenty-Four Eyes ($29.95; Criterion) is a beloved Japanese film about a schoolteacher, sort of their Goodbye Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chips; Vera Farmiga continues to impress in Quid Pro Quo ($26.98; Magnolia), an indie flick co-starring the equally impressive Nick Stahl in this disturbing look at a subculture of people turned on by missing limbs -- a natural double bill withCronenberg's Crash ; but it's still not as disturbing as Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo, or 120 Days of Sodom ($39.95; Criterion), which revels in the torture and degradation of Fascist Italy and I've never been abe to get through it, which is probably a recommendation to some; Miss PettigrewLives For A Day ($29.98; Universal) doesn't quite capture the screwball charm of the comic novelbut it's an enjoyable bit of fluff about a dour woman caught up in high society and FrancesMcDormand and Amy Adams clearly have a ball; the Academy Award winner for Best ForeignFilm, The Countefeiters ($28.96; Sony Pictures Classics) tells the fascinating true story of a con man who finds himself helping the Nazis produce fake money to fund the war just so he can avoidbeing killed; the marvelous black comedy Delicatessen ($19.98; Lionsgate) in a new special edition of the story of a deli that can rival the one in Sweeney Todd for delicious meats; Karim Ainouz proves he's a director to watch by following the vibrant Madame Sata with Love For Sale ($27.97; Strand), another compelling drama about people on the boundaries of society; AKA Tommy Chong($24.98; Infinity) is a documentary that deftly exposes the absurdity of prosecuting someone likeChong in the war on drugs; David Mamet explores the fight world in Redbelt ($27.96; Sony Pictures Classics) with Chiwetel Ejiofor typically imposing as a martial arts expert forced to stepinto the ring and fight for the first time; The Life Before Her Eyes ($26.98; Magnolia) was a blink and you missed it followup to the Oscar-nominated House of Sand and Fog, but star Evan Rachel Wood is clearly an astonishing young actress; and there's a mini Michael Powell festival thanks tothe release of Classic British Thrillers ($24.98; MPI), which has three fine movies on one disc, including two early ventures by the great Powell and then The Small Back Room ($39.95; Criterion), a lesser known Powell-Pressburger drama presented with the usual care of Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV On DVD: It never ends, the wave of TV product coming to DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gossip Girl First Season ($59.98; Warner Bros.) is a guilty pleasure of a soap and if the show were half as clever as the ad campaign promoting its second season it would rank as one of the best shows on TV instead of justone of the most-discussed. (Bonus points for including an audiobook reading of the novelperformed by Christina Ricci.)

Finally, I'm too much of a wimpto watch horror movies, so you'll have to tell me how Brittany Snow is in the remake of PromNight ($28.96; Sony), whether terror runs deep as they claim for Skinned Alive ($26.98; Lionsgate) and if 6 Films To Keep You Awake ($27.98; Lionsgate) really does cause sleepless nights with flicks like Spectre and A Christmas Tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, any thoughts? Who should play Barack Obama in the inevitable miniseries/feature film? You can always go with Daniel Day Lewis -- he can play anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Actor Should Play Obama? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-actor-should-pl_b_122509.html [4/5/2009 1:38:59 PM]Comments 16 Pending Comments 0 The President's Daugthers Check Out The Lastest Pics Of Malia &amp; Sasha Obama At The Frisky! www.TheFrisky.com Want to reply to a comment?
