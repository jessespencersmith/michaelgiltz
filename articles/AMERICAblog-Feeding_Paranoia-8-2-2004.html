A casual reader would believe these troubling eventsindicate terrorists are all over the U.S. getting ready to strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Run forthe hills!But just a few days ago, the New York Times did a lenghty storyabout the Syrian musicians, making clear it was a case of culturalmisperceptions, that the men had been thoroughly questioned andinterviewed by three federal agencies and the LAPD and found to beexactly who they claimed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So how did a false alarm morph intoone of a string of disturbing incidents, much less one that the authortells us was not "a direct factor" in the decision to go to CodeOrange? Huh? Why would a panicky investigation of musicians thatproved to be nothing at all be any factor at all?It's irresponsible to investigate an incident, report that it was nothingat all, but then include it in a list of disturbing events that might havecontributed to the high alert the article has warned us about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If theNYT needs to retract its earlier article, it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, thisseemingly banal paragraph is misleading and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moredangerous, in fact, than those musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, this doesn't callinto question the report of heightened alert -- it calls into questionsthe NYT's coverage of that alert and how it conflates false alarms intoincidents of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser Logout from DisqusLogged in as HuffPost PoliticsLincoln Leaves Door Open For EFCA Compromise -Senator Blanche Lincoln on Monday announcedthat she would vote against the Employee FreeChoice Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But later she elaborated, leaving thedoor open for...1 minute agoDaily KosBeck: Daily Kos, C&amp;L blame me for cop killer -Because it’s all about him, right?
