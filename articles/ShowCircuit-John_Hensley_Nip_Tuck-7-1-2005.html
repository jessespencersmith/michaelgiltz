                <p>ACTOR JOHN HENSLEY PLAYS THE REBELLIOUS SON of a South Florida plastic surgeon in the hit TV show Nip/Tuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hensley's high school character-Matt McNamara-is in­ volved in everything from a threesome to hit-and-run acci­ dents to dating a transsexual old enough to be his mother on the acclaimed drama that returns to the FX Network for its third season in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's about as far away from cowboying as a guy can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet, Hensley insists that nothing prepared him more for acting than growing up in the bluegrass state of Kentucky among Appaloosas and later horse wrangling in Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, Hensley's first break-getting a man­ ager to represent a kid with virtually no acting experience--came about be­ cause of horses. "I remember the first meeting I had with the man that manages me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was just starting out and looking for any break I could get;' re­ members Hensley, 27. "I made up this little resume, which had almost liter­ ally nothing on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I put at the bottom: Horse Wrangler-Cody, Wyoming:' The manager took note of the horse wrangler entry, recalls Hensley. "He John Hensley in Wyoming, aboard a mustang colt at Rim Rock Ranch, 1999 John Hensley, star of the hit TV show Nip/Tuck, insists that nothing prepared him more for acting than being a horse wrangler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Giltz • Photographs by Starla Fortunato for Show Circuit Styling by Judy Sellards Haft • Grooming by Larri Peak SHOW CIRCUIT @ SUMMER 2005 Riding up Table Mountain, with Ptarmigan Mountain in the background, Wyoming, 1998 "It was my time horse wrangling that made me what I am today." With Famke Janssen in Nip/Tuck said, 'They aren't making too many Westerns these days.' And 1 don't know why, but I said, 'Yeah, that's something I plan on changing: And I think he liked it, because he decided to sign me." If it sounds like self-confidence won the day, Hensley says a lot of that came from being responsible for a herd of about 150 horses. "I really think it was my time horse wrangling that made me what I am today;' asserts Hensley, who has also appeared on The Sopranos and has an upcoming independent film called Fifty Pills. "It instilled a confidence, or maybe a better word would be solidity, that I didn't have before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have to learn self-sufficiency and work through situations and get the job done." Hensley spent his childhood years in Kentucky surrounded by the Ap­ paloosas his dad kept on their homestead. "My dad used to call me his horse breaker, because when I was eight I was always the first wide body on the back of a green broke horse's back;' muses Hensley, who now lives in Los Angeles but would love to own a se­ cluded ranch in the West someday. "He would basically gentle them to the point where they were ready to have somebody on their back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The way he saw it, he might as well throw a little body on there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So really my first mem­ ories of riding were being in the riding ring, him sort of gently placing me on the back of the horse and then getting led around by the lead rope:' When Hensley was about ten years old, his dad scooped the boy onto the back of another horse he was riding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When an unexpected sound startled the horse, it bucked and Hensley was sent flying head over heels, landing on his back in the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boy's father feared his back was broken, but only Hensley's spirit suffered damage. "That experience really turned me off to horses for years; it freaked me SHOW CIRCUIT @ SUMMER 2005 Leading a pack horse in Wapiti Valley, Wyoming, summer of 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hensley would love to own a secluded ranch someday. out:' admits Hensley. "It wasn't until I was 15 and my dad took me out to Wyoming for vacation that 1 rediscovered my love for horses. 1 remember landing at Cody airport, and I'd never seen a landscape like that in my life and I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was so desperate to be a part of that, that 1 would face any fear to be a part of it:' The final spur to pursue his dream of acting was the sudden and unex­ pected death of his father. "He died in the saddle, literally:' recounts Hensley. "He and a friend of ours were up on a ridge and got caught in a snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But my dad wasn't the type to wait around, so they were walking the horses down through the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally they got back on their horses when my dad said he was feel­ ing chest pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said, 'It hurts, it hurts really bad.' "The guy with him -who's a very good friend of mine as well as his - joked with him and said, 'I don't need your ass dying on me out here: My dad was quiet for a moment and said, 'You know, if 1 do, it's been a good life.'" Hensley's dad collapsed a few moments later and died before he hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hensley takes comfort in the knowledge that his dad was doing what he loved best right up until the last moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, the realization through this experience that life is so precious has propelled Hensley into not wasting another moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He headed off to college and then to New York City, where that deep connection to nature continued to comfort him. "When 1 first arrived in the city, I realized the sun set early, just like it did in Cody, Wyoming: : notes Hensley. "The mountains blocked out the sun in Cody, and the skyscrapers blocked it out early in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it felt the same and I knew right then everything was going to be all right!' • SHOW CIRCUIT @ SUMMER 2005</p>
