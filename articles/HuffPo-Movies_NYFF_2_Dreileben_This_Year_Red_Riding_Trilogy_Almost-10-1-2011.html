(Note: That's Linda Ronstadt singing on "Cry Me A River." She's blossomed into an excellent big band singer; I hope she does more.) Part Two is called "Don't Follow Me Around." It revolves around a female detective who is part of a team that's come to town to help with the manhunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it soon turns out the team is also there to crackdown on corruption, something the local cops are none too pleased about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our heroine stays with an old friend and the woman's best-selling author of a husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Complicated entanglements ensue because both women were once in love with another man and our heroine encourages (or just doesn't deter?) herfriend from leaving the husband to pursue that lost love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for what reason? It's a little twisty and unexpected and the ending is again satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with all three films, there is some modest cross-over of characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part Three is called "One Minute Of Darkness." It's easily the weakest because the focus is on the alleged killer on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not necessarily mentally challenged but he's rather simple to say the least, asheltered mamma's boy who may or may not have lashed out in violence without quite being fully responsible for his actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or so we imagine after following him for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even an evil man can be empathized with as he's hunted down and this fellow seems so odd and harmless, you easily root for him(at least a little) as he clambers through the forest, hides in storm drains and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, he's alsorather dull and the wrap-up is a cheat on several levels and very unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, Dreileben is an interesting stunt filled with some solid performances, though it might be draining as a festival event and better enjoyed on DVD.Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz has access to free screenings of all the movies at the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Sponsored Links 57-Year-Old Mom Looks 25 Her clever $6 Wrinkle Therapy Angers Botox Doctors. www.iconsumerknowledge.com New Trick in TENNESSEE If you drive 25 mi/day or less you better read this...MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
