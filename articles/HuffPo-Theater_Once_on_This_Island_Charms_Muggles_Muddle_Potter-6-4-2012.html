(I won't praise the fine costumes by jessica Jahn because surely a taleon the islands could have shown some more skin?) And the almost uniformly excellent cast delivered thesolid choreography by Bradley Rapier with ease and made the entire evening a pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Thomas Kail kept a sure hand on the rudder of this pleasure boat, which begins with a little girl scared by a thunderstorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's distracted from her fears by being told the story of their island, which issplit into two sides -- the wealthy, light-skinned descendants of the French and the poor (but happy! Ididn't say it was original) dark-skinned peasants who descended from slaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovely Ti Moune (SyeshaMercado -- who I admired a lot on season seven of American Idol ) is an orphan taken in by an elderly couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One day the handsome Daniel (Adam Jacobs) gets in a car accident and Ti Moune rescues him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She follows the young man back to the hotel/palace where he lives because she's convinced the gods want herto nurse him back to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They fall in love, sort of, but he is already promised to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is afairy tale, but a real one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in real fairy tales people die and bitterly sad endings often take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SoMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO)FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (27) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA CELEBRITY TV COMEDY FOOD STYLE ARTS BOOKS LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Robert L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BorosageHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 06/04/2012 3:46 pm SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storySPONSOR GENERATED POST Recommend 671 Like 6k Recommend 250 Like 6k Like 34 Like 3kPolitical Hollywood Electronic Dance Music The Avengers One Direction More Log in Create Accountdon't assume everything will turn out all right in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pleasure of this story is in the telling, which uses simple props like masks and bolts of cloth to simulate the strangeness of the city or a rainstorm and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opener "We Dance" is delivered strongly bythe entire cast, as are many of the tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But first among equals is Mercado, who really blossoms here.She captures the sweet naivete of an innocent girl on the cusp of womanhood very nicely and withoutoverdoing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looks lovely, has a voice that easily fills the Paper Mill's big space, dances well and hasexcellent stage presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark her down as yet another Idol contestant who can and should establishherself on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A high point in the songs is "The Sad Tale Of The Beauxhommes," which uses the entire cast, puppetry, dance and more to put over this story song about the origins of the two separate classes of people on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other tunes don't always stick out, even when delivered with style, like Aurelia Williams doing her best to turn the rather pat "Mama Will Provide" into a showstopper. (She darn near succeeds.) Kenita R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller and Kevin R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free are very good as Ti Moune's guardians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Mingo Jr. has fun as Papa Ge, the God of Death, adding a much needed sense of menace to the climax of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CourtneyReed is strikingly pretty and makes the most of her brief scenes as the intended of Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jacobs asDaniel, however, is the weak link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's notably stiff in his brief bits of dialogue and we feel no realconnection between him and Ti Moune, so very little feels at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, he sings his big solonumber "Some Girls" quite well in a classic Broadway ballad style. (It's also one of the show's best songs.)And he unquestionably looks the part of a Prince Charming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that lack of sexual charge between Daniel and Ti Moune highlights the show's squeaky clean weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly geared towards families, there's still no reason why the entire production should feel so lacking in sensuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A show set in a Haiti-like island could surely feel more sexy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're told Daniel has a notable scar on his chest but it's almost a surprise Ti Moune has seen it, the proceedings are sowholesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Ti Moune dances at the ball and raises her skirt -- just a little, mind you -- she seemsto be wearing leggings or stockings (or apparently knee pads -- see the comments below) of some sort, as if even a glimpse of her legs would be too randy for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That lack of passion, of earthiness, of sex -- and sexual attraction should be at the heart of any romance -- keeps this nicely mounted production fromlifting off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though nothing should stop Mercado from using this excellent showcase to further herBroadway ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel may have spurned her but I'm certain producers and directors and writerswho see her will fall in love with that talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POTTED POTTER * out of **** LITTLE SCHUBERT THEATRE This two-man show that promises to condense all seven Harry Potter books into a 70 minuteperformance/parody does everything you would expect and less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It follows in the tradition of the ReducedShakespeare Company's condensation of the Bard's plays into one (very long-running) bit of tomfoolery,which itself inspired all sorts of spin-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the latest and actors/creators Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner seem like affable fellows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One is a Potter fanatic; the other hasn't even bothered to read them all yet when the show begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage isfilled with a silly looking choo-choo train, a bookcase with the Potter books lined up, a wardrobe (oops,that's Narnia!) and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They goof around, play with props, turn Quidditch into an excuse to have theaudience bat around a beach ball, joke about Voldemort and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't be surprised by pop culturereferences to Shrek, The Chronicles Of Narnia, The Lord Of the Rings, Star Wars, Lemony Snicket and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't be surprised by much of anything here unless you're very very young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOP Approves Abortion Ban PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie The Most Awkward Wedding Photobombs DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3Recommend 8k Like 923 Like 882 Cameron Diaz Rocks Short Shorts Celebrity Bytes: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt Book a Holiday in the Lake District Celebrity Bytes: HarryStyles Flashes a New Tattoo While Shooting Music Video Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson's Shocking Tweets About Isaac WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin Fact-Checking '2016 Obama's America' The disappointment is that the lads didn't really put any effort into this, other than stocking up on Silly String and bad puns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When they get to the third book, the fellow who has pretended not to have read them decides he can predict what will happen in it based on what happened in the first two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, this might actually have a little substance to it, I thought, since the first three books all followed a formula which author JK Rowling finally abandoned in book four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kids might get an amusing tweak of Rowling's world by being reminded how lock-step those first three books were by beginning with Harry being whisked to Hogwarts, facing a challenge and then Gryffindor winning top prize at the end of term (rather annoyingly, I thought at the time)&gt; No such luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't break down the formula or even try to "predict" what might happen in book three by playing off other familiar works lie LOTR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just list afew plot points and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly at the finale they begin by letting Professor Snape (the most complex and conflicted character in the books) sing a song based around the melody of "I Will Survive." Well if anyone deserves their ownnumber, it's Snape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's quickly abandoned after a line or two and suddenly Voldemort and othersare singing in a meaningless little number that doesn't comment on or amusingly toy with the charactersand stories Rowling created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just a lazy, disco-ball finale with no more thought put into it than anyother gag in this show that runs a rather long 70 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The very little kids in the audience certainlyweren't bored and had plenty of chances to shout out comments or thwack at a ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the full houseat the quite nice Little Schubert, I can see parents being tempted into an easy time-killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But kids whohave seen very little theater deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHIMICHANGAS AND ZOLOFT * out of **** ATLANTIC STAGE 2 The awkward, would-be wacky title of Fernanda Coppel's comic drama is the first hint that this would be a poorly conceived evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two families are thrown into chaos by the emotional meltdown of Sonia(Zabryna Guevara), who has left her husband and daughter after a suicide attempt to try and pull herselftogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Easily the most accomplished actor here and an appealing stage presence, this isolation meansthat for most of the show Guevara is alone, delivering tepid monologues directly to the audience, andalmost never gets to interact with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leaves the rest of the show to her sports-loving husband Ricardo (Teddy Canez) and their daughter Jackie (Carmen Zilles) to carry on as best they can with the help of their neighbors Alejandro (Alfredo Narciso) and his daughter Penelope (Xochitl Romero).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The teenage girls are bickering best friends, with jackie worried that coming out to her mom is what drove Sonia way while Penelope is doing it with a drug-dealing loser who may have knocked her up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penelope's dad is stereotypically gay (he even worries about drinks leaving a water stain on an outdoor wooden table that must surely get rained on) though it's not clear that he is openly gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is clear is that he and Ricardo are having a torrid affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The teenagers fight and make up every two minutes and call each other "dude" so relentlessly you want to scream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As mentioned, Alejandro is comically gay and yet even by the end ofthe play I wasn't quite certain if he was out or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there was any explanation of what happened to hiswife and Penelope's mother, I missed it. (Dead? Divorced? Run off like Sonia?) Stupidities are endless --Jackie texts her mom and says she's pregnant to try and get her to come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When her dad finds thisout, instead of simply telling the truth, she and Penelope start divulging their darkest secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later, thetwo girls are forbidden to speak to each other ever again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? I haven't the foggiest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gay affair is utterly unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hate to criticize any actors in a play this weak (which is why I won't comment on the anonymous sets, costumes or direction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a sad truth that if you want to be a male actor in the theater you're simply going to have to play a gay role and probably kiss a guy at some point. (Hey, women have had to play whores for a hundred years on movies and tv, so don't complain.)These two actors are painfully awkward in their brief, romantic moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't blame them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Snooki Russia Gay Rights Energy Mitt Romney Hackers Television Germany News and Trends MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, many others including octopi, have human-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQh cher RetweetRT @cher This is the TRUTH http://t.co/pW8Dq69N…FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Robin Williams As Dwight D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eisenhower In...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...

Her performance was very good, as I said and she looked great. 10:16 AM on 06/05/2012 I'd love to see Once on This Island come into New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it'd do better today than when it first opened back in 1990. (It was only a marginal hit, if I recall, might've even lost money).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always thought it was a case of the right show in the right place at the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In those days, Broadway was still in the grip of the Lloyd Weber/Mackintosh invasion, which for all its razzle-dazzle offered rather dull, predictable music -- bland operetta meets bland Euro-pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just wasn't a good time to ask audiences and critics to embrace a unpretentious, childlike show featuring steel drums and calypso rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the era of the BIG MUSICAL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The intervening 20 or so years have loosened things up -- we're hearing a wider variety of musical styles on and off B'way than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiences have become accustomed to more modestlyscaled shows that employ dance and lighting and puppetry, rather than chandeliers and helicopters,to achieve their big moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in these dark times, this sunshiny trifle might be just the thingaudiences are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It isn't a milestone in musical theater history, but I do recall enjoying itimmensely and leaving the theater wishing it a long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But yeah, for a Broadway musical, a little more skin is never a bad thing. 09:39 AM on 06/05/2012 Broadway surely beckons for former Idol star Syesha Mercado Advertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright © 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost EntertainmentPermalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it 3fingerbrown Permalink | Share it JDHARTIL Permalink | Share it127 Fans 608 Fans 17 Fans Entertainment Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Read more Los Lobos , Matt Damon , The Hunger Games , Animation , Disney , Documentaries , Dvds , Entertainment NewsReact Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: Chimps Rule! CHIMPANZEE ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- The political documentary 2016: Obama's America is a huge hit for a film in its genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's crazy to say it's the top documentary film of the year... except for nature documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the caveat news outlets must make, which is kind of like saying a movieis the top family film of the year... except for animated films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or the top drama of the year... except forones with vampires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, the top documentary of the year so far is Chimpanzee , the latest in what is proving an annual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year around Earth Day, Disney releases a new documentary about ourworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This latest was directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, both of whom can be found onthe credits of some of the best documentaries in history, namely the Blue Planet and Planet Earth TV shows and their theatrical spinoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one isn't quite up to the level of those, but it's an engaging lookat the life of a little chimpanzee from birth through traumatic events and the possibility of a happyfuture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parents beware: nature throws our hero Oscar a few Bambi -like curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's presented as gently as possible but is there nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The very sensitive and the very young might be upset by thoseMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (27) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I could have done without narrator Tim Allen's jokey asides, but they're modest and brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who have seen the startling beauty of those other films won't be surprised when I say many of the shots -- especially the opening scene setters -- are so striking I half wondered if they were special effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Cameronwould be jealous of the imagery on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, it is superior family entertainment and deservedlyshould be lauded as the biggest hit documentary film of the year, no matter what political party you'reregistered in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE HUNGER GAMES ($39.99 Bluray combo; Lionsgate) -- OK, now fans breathlessly waiting for the second film installment in the series can watch and rewatch The Hunger Games .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some truths will emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pageant towards the beginning where the contestants are on display is an embarrassment --Katniss is supposed to be clothed in an outfit that bursts into simulated flames and the special effect is solame (even for a somewhat low budget film tackling such a big tale) that it's literally cringe-inducing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itlooks like an effect a kid would produce for their home-made YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a throw-away scenebut a key moment in the "selling" of Katniss to a TV audience that will ultimately have a hand in decidingher fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It never, ever should have made it to screen in its present form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a commercial decision, I would have stuck with director Gary Ross who delivered a massive worldwide hit on a relative dime and did a great job of finding his stars alongside casting director Debra Zane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Ross is much better at the earlier dramatic scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So on an artistic level, the action portion of the film might improve mightily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, as if there were any question, Team Peeta, all the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A SEPARATION ($35.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics) -- This sensational drama was my introduction to the talents of director Asghar Farhadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rightful winner of the Academy Award for BestForeign Film (when will they change the name to Best International Film, by the way?) it's a penetrating,utterly involving drama of life in contemporary Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wife who decides she wants a separation from herhusband begins a cascade of events that include hiring a woman to watch after her husband's elderlyfather and soon one action leads to another and the consequences become more and more dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'ssuperlative drama of the highest order and now that I've been able to see two more of Farhadi's films, Iknow it's not a fluke either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a world class director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone interested in drama, cinema or just agood family drama should watch this immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) GOP Approves Abortion Ban PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2Like 3k Recommend 8k Like 967 Cameron Diaz Rocks Short Shorts Celebrity Bytes: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt Book a Holiday in the Lake District Celebrity Bytes: HarryStyles Flashes a New Tattoo While Shooting Music Video Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Disney) THE ARISTOCATS ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) POCAHONTAS/POCAHONTAS II ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) THE TIGGER MOVIE ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- The Rescuers and The Aristocats were made during the dark days of Disney animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are cheaply produced, with flat, static backdrops and the modest stories are geared strictly at tykes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's depressing to see movies with the Disney name that haveanimation more appropriate for a cheap Saturday morning cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's no excuse for the paucityof imagination on display, especially with fine voice actors like Bob Newhart and the inspired choice ofEva Gabor on tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the Sherman Brothers can't rescue The Aristocats , despite a few decent songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pocahontas is an overshadowed entry from Disney's second golden period (before they were outclassed by Pixar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's awfully politically correct but gorgeously animated and proudly embraces a rare downbeatending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's puzzling and annoying that Disney doesn't allow fans the option to watch the movie with the duet reinstated for the 10th Anniversary DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz always wanted it in and they did it the last time around but now it's relegated to an extra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie doesn't become a classic but it's certainly better without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like The Rescuers set, it includes an inferior sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally there's The Tigger Movie , a glorified straight to DVD release that ended up being released theatrically and doing quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It falls somewhere in the middle here, not a cheap sad tale but a good proving ground foryoung Disney talent, albeit not so good that it makes you forget how good Disney can truly be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it was the Sherman Brothers again to the rescue, with some superior songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS LOBOS KIKO LIVE ($16.98 DVD; Shout) LOS LOBOS -- KIKO 20TH ANNIVERSARY ($9.99 CD; Shout) -- Los Lobos is a great roots rock band that threw everyone for a loop with their sonic masterpiece Kiko .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans and critics still haven't quite recovered, and though it's a favorite of the cognoscenti, Kiko still hasn't entered the pantheon the way it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's face it, you wouldn't have expected a psychedelic masterpiece from Creedence ClearwaterRevival and you didn't expect this left-field beauty from the ferociously rocking band behind "Will TheWolf Survive?" But, boy is it a great album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been 20 years and people need to take a deep breath,listen to this album with fresh ears and realize what a landmark it is, every bit the equal of Wilco'sYankee Hotel Foxtrot, Radiohead's Kid A and other oddball classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's lyrical, shimmering, strange, lovely and haunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can rock out to the CD (headphones preferred, thank you very much) or youcan buy the DVD and enjoy a live performance with the album played in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band is at the peak of their powers (though I'd love to see them again today -- they're touring on their own and with Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse, which is a terrific double bill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The live DVD isn't edited crazily like so many concert films and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can watch just the concert or a fuller version along withinterviews and other extras wrapped around the performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any format, you'll appreciate anew agreat American band and their greatest album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSE SEASON EIGHT ($74.98 BluRay; Universal) THE CLOSER SEVENTH SEASON ($59.98 DVD; Warner Bros.) GLEE THIRD SEASON ($59.98 DVD; FOX) MIKE &amp; MOLLY SEASON TWO ($44.98 DVD: Warner Bros.) MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS SEASON 1 VOLUME 1 ($19.93 DVD; Shout) REVENGE FIRST SEASON ($45.99 DVD: ABC) DOCTOR WHO: THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE GALAXY /DOCTOR WHO: SPEARHEAD FROM SPACE ($24.98 each on DVD; BBC) -- It's hard to know when to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; House clearly got it wrong; one season earlier and I think fans and critics would have mourned the show more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it was, eight seasons was clearly more than enough, though that doesn't dim Hugh Laurie's fun in creating oneof TV's most indelible pains in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Closer , however, got it just right, with the show leaving at the top of its game ratings-wise and Kyra Sedgwick brandishing that crazy Southern accent to great effectright up to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glee can't say goodbye because it has something to prove after a creatively disastrous season two and a not much better season three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like clingy parents, they refuse to let go of key charactersafter they graduate and that does not bode well for season four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here's hoping they get back on track.(Start by insisting the songs actually have something to do with the scenes at hand, guys!) Mike &amp; Molly moved a bit beyond the incessant fat jokes to allow Melissa McCarthy to blossom even more as a full- bodied woman in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of Power Rangers are ga-ga for the 20th anniversary reunion that's going to bring together every surviving Power Ranger that they can for the ultimate showdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until then, thehardcore fans can begin again where it all started with this economical first half of season one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains 30 episodes and no frills but who needs frills when you've got the MMPRs? The guilty pleasure of last season deserves a wider audience and this DVD release of Season One of Revenge leaves you no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I continue to plead for complete boxed sets for each Doctor, but fans will enjoy these single releases of prior Doctor Who adventures with entire tales and loads (I do mean loads) ofextras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What better way to prep for the new season starting Saturday on BBC America? GOOD WILL HUNTING ($14.99 BluRay; Miramax/Lionsgate) -- This is a corny sentimental film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if it makes you cry, who am I to spoil your pleasure? And it made Oscar-winning stars out of MattDamon and Ben Affleck, both of whom have acquitted themselves very nicely as actors and in Affleck'scase especially as a director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, it gave the very talented director Gus Van Sant a dualtrack of intriguing indies and bland studio pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since he uses his Hollywood juice to make flickslike Elephant , at least he's used his power for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I still quote the "How do you like them apples?" line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE NY GIANTS ($26.97 DVD; NFL/Vivendi) -- This is a rerelease of the 2004 documentary about the Giants, modestly updated to fill in the last eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strictly forfans, though NFL Films always has great footage you've never seen before in their releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You used tohave to wait for a weekend TV broadcast; now fans can enjoy their access any time.THE DICTATOR ($39.99 BluRay combo; Paramount) SPACEBALLS ($19.99 BluRay; MGM) POST MORTEM ($$29.95 DVD: Kino Lorber) -- What's a comedy? Here are three pretty radically different responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sacha Baron Cohen likes to mix the forms of reality TV when mining his cultural collisions between Western society and the "foreign," in this case a brutal dictator who is deposed andmust go to work in a health food store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure he and Mel Brooks would get along mightily, but Brooksis doing a very different sort of comedy with Spaceballs , his spoof of Star Wars and Alien and Indiana Jones and anything else that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'd rather trade in one top drawer joke for ten cheap onesbecause a laugh is a laugh, right? Young Frankenstein it ain't but time has actually helped this one not seem so out of step because when it first came out Star Wars seemed to be pretty passe as a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the very (very) different comedy Post Mortem is the second in a trilogy of films looking at Chilethrough a mordant, unexpected lens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It focuses on a man who takes notes during autopsies but is oftendaydreaming about his leftist neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the government is overthrown, the bodies of hercompatriots begin to dominate his job and the man can't keep political reality at bay any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one, I think, would like all three of these films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hearing who likes which two and why would be fascinating.MY SON JOHN ($29.95 BluRay; Olive/Paramount) CAPTAIN CAREY U.S.A. ($29.95 BluRay; Olive/Paramount) PRIVATE HELL 36 ($29.95 BluRay; Olive/Paramount) -- Another batch of catalog titles from Paramount rescued and brought to life by Olive Films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My Son John is a relic of the Cold War, with parents Helen Hayes and Dean Jagger petrified that their eldest is a dirty commie. it's especially notable for being the final film of Robert Walker, who died during production at the age of 32 years old, onereason at least the film is unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Ladd is very satisfying in Captain Carey, in which a WW II operative returns to his stomping ground in Italy and discovers there are still wrongs to be righted anddeaths to be avenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, there's the trim noir Private Hell 36 in which two cops keep a stash of money from a crime and are ridden with guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ida Lupino co-wrote and stars; the more I see of herfascinating career, the more I like her. ***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiple combinations, includingDVD, Blu-ray, digital download, video on demand, streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The format listed is theformat provided for review, not all the formats available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is often the most expensive version with themost extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do check individual titles for availability in all their various guises and price points.FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Brenda Chapman, Fired 'Brave' Director, Bounces Back...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Williams As Dwight D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eisenhower In...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-rays with the understanding that he would be considering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does not guarantee to review and he receives far more titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright © 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost Entertainment Recency | Popularity Like 75k GET ALERTS Comments 0 Pending Comments 0 View FAQ Post Comment Preview Comment Post to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to TypePad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post to Tumblr.To reply to a Comment: Click "Reply" at the bottom of the comment; after being approved your comment will appear directly underneath the comment you replied to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share your Comment: View All</p>
