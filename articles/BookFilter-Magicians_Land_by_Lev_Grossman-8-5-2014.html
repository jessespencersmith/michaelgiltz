Thefirst book had teens cursing and doing drugs and having sex and all the things teens might do when they're not infamily friendly adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was an amusing conceit but for me didn't go farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in his second book and now thefinale, Grossman has deepened the psychology and plumbed his idea of taking these tales seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I must admitthat the others who raved were right (or at least righter) all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think about it: what if you were a kid allowed toenter a Narnia-like world where you were royalty with magical powers...and then it was taken away? That doeshappen quite a bit in tales, especially when children hit adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But really, wouldn't that mess up your mindimmeasurably? That's the focus of this third and final book, where Quentin Coldwater is the kid who has been castout of the magical land of Fillory for no particular fault of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The land needs saving so guess what? Quentinmight just be able to force his way back in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even here, I feel the book spells out its intentions too baldlytowards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a very satisfying exploration of the characters Grossman created and how fantasy can reallyF you up, as they might say in more salty terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And do say! I especially enjoyed Grossman's intriguing descriptionsof spell-casting and the work that goes into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who were already on board with the first two should be deeplysatisfied by this emotionally satisfying, ambitious finale. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for The Magician's Land“An absolutely brilliant fantasy filled with memorable characters—old and new—and prodigious feats of imagination. .. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Endlessly fascinating . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fantasy fans will rejoice at its publication.”—Booklist (starred review) “Sink your mobile devices into the nearest wishing well and duct-tape your front door against gnomes, pollsters, andother distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Magician’s Land is beckoning, and demands your full attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lev Grossman proves againthat the costs and consolations of creation—both of Fillory and of this conclusion to his trilogy—are mighty forces.Quentin Coldwater, Grossman's Orpheus and his Abraham, his Yahweh and his Puck, enchants as few othermagicians can, or dare.”—Gregory Maguire, author of Wicked and Egg &amp; Spoon “Lev Grossman has conjured a rare creature: a trilogy that simply gets better and better as it goes along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TheMagician's Land is sumptuous and surprising yet deliciously familiar, a glass of rich red wine left out for a hungryghost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Literary perfection for those of us who grew…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
