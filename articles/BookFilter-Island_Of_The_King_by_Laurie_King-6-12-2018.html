With Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudson gone from their lives and domestic chaos building, the last thingMary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, need is to help an oldfriend with her mad and missing aunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lady Vivian Beaconsfield has spentmost of her adult life in one asylum after another, since the loss of herbrother and father in the Great War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And although her mental state seemed to be improving, she’s now disappeared after an outing from Bethlem Royal Hospital . . . better known as Bedlam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell wantsnothing to do with the case—but she can’t say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And at least it will gether away from the challenges of housework and back to the familiar business of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

What We Say Author Laurie R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King follows one of her strongest entries in the Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes series with a water-treading tale set in Venice. 2016's "The Murder Of Mary Russell" was a slam-bang volume that turned on the inconspicuousShare This Book About The Author Laurie R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King Laurie R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King is the New York Times bestselling author of fifteen Mary Russellmysteries, five contemporary novelsfeaturing Kate Martinelli, the Stuyvesant &amp;Grey novels Touchstone and The Bones of Paris, and the acclaimed standalones Lockdown, A Darker Place, Folly, Califia’sDaughters (written under the pen name Leigh Richards), and Keeping Watch .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She lives on California’s Central Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: June 12, 2018 Publisher: Bantam Pages: 320 ISBN 10: 0804177961 ISBN 13: 9780804177962housekeeper Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King's refusal to "reset" the story at the end and return things as they were proved most satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before that, "Dreaming Spies" had fun with its Japanese setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here the action and especially the mystery feel rote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell and Holmes head to Vienna -- Russell to track down a seemingly mad heiress who may simply be a lesbian fleeing "Bedlam" to make a life for herself; Holmes to scout out the rise of fascism for brother Mycroft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Little suspense canbe found in either quarter since fascism is most definitely on the rise and the woman of means with her lover proves to bejust as suspected, or should I say hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russell learns to drive a speedboat and coach a gay pal in the new fad ofwater skiing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holmes dons a Zorro costume and charms Cole Porter to the point where Russell cheekily wonders if Porter is hoping to misbehave with the great detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all rather low-key and almost beside the point, more an idyll than an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With King having substantially raised the stakes last time around, she may have to choose between simply endingthe series or pushing it again into bolder, uncharted territory. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Praise for the award-winning novels of Laurie R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King “The great marvel of King’s series is that she’s managed to preserve the integrity of Holmes’s character and yetsomehow conjure up a woman astute, edgy, and compelling enough to be the partner of his mind as well as hisheart.” —The Washington Post Book World “A lively adventure in the very best of intellectual company.” —The New York Times “Erudite, fascinating . . . by all odds the most successful re-creation of the famous inhabitant of 221B Baker Street ever attempted.” —Houston Chronicle “Will have [fans diving in] with reckless abandon.” —Booklist (starred review) “Whip-smart, suspenseful and intricately plotted.” —Shelf Awareness “Captivating.” —Us Weekly “Highly entertaining.” —The Denver Post “Deliciously rich.” —Santa Cruz Sentinel “Extremely exciting.” —Chicago Tribune What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
