(Ellen coming, Simon going - - eventually -- blah blah blah.) But the top-rated show in America returned Tuesday night without missing a beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the pure Americana of the opener where we got a glimpse of young people from all walks of life who dream of singing or inspiring or just escaping their dead-end jobs to the finale of one last golden ticket, American Idol remains a very well-crafted, well-edited, entertaining show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tone for the first night was notably more optimistic, with a welcome downplaying of the oddballs and losers and an element of empathy even during the rejection montages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe the Idol producers understand a country in recession doesn't want to watch people being kicked when they're down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they also presented the inspirational tales (my least favorite element of the show) with a certain restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, we saw people with siblings who have Down's syndrome, people withgrandmothers who have Alzheimer's and people who have fought off cancer, but it never felt too MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | LeAnn Rimes | Levi Johnston | Movies | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 1 Don't Miss Tonight's Rare Full Moon Eclipse Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Passes Senate Procedural Vote Sarah Palin Jabs Michelle Obama's Anti-Obesity Campaign Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our Time Timothy Karr Obama FCC Caves on Net Neutrality -- Tuesday...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: 10 Things We've Accidentally Learned From Crime Dramas PHOTOS: 13 Products Most Likely To Be Made By Child Or Forced Labor Like 39K Like 40K Like 5K Like 11K Like 8K Like 1K Recommend 3K manipulative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idol told their stories and then moved on, led smoothly by Ryan Seacrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for the judges, Kara seemed more relaxed, Randy remained mellow and Simon was Simon, though not as acerbic (or at least not edited to appear as acerbic) as he normally is shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The guest judge was Victoria Beckham aka Posh Spice and while I generally avoid commenting negatively on people'sappearances, she is clearly one more victim of the Hollywood mania for plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her face was sopinched and smoothed out and incapable of registering any emotion, I actually found it difficult to watch her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her demeanor was generally of the nice, positive variety though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the tone the show set was pitch perfect: entertaining, generally upbeat and positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why bother with the oddballs? Here are my impressions of most of the people we saw make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MADDY CURTIS -- the teen from a giant family with brothers who have Down's Syndrome, Maddy sang Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah." She was fine and it's certainly a challenging song to sing and anyone singing it knows that Cohen and Jeff Buckley and Rufus Wainwright have sung the heck out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maddy was fine and has a nice voice, though it's hard to tell how much vocal character she has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara annoyingly said Maddy has an old soul, when that's the song, not her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon amusingly heard everyone else say yes and then said "Now the one that counts...four yeses." Maddy paused before walking out and said, "I really enjoyed singing for you" so at least we know she's been raised right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Simon's compliment du jourquickly became "You're not annoying." JENNIFER -- Sang a jazzy version of "Ding, Dong, The Witch Is Dead." Brief, but really caught my ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fun! And an offbeat choice that paid off. (And obviously, I didn't catch her last name.)AMADEO DIRICCO -- Boisterous Italian guy who LOVES his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sang the Muddy Waters tune "Hoochie Coochie Man." Very limited voice, just a guy who can belt it out in a bar, though maybe just karaoke and not a bar band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seemed quite limited but the judges liked his personality and gave him four yeses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LUKE SHAFFER and BENJAMIN BRIGHT -- two guys seen harmonizing in the waiting room (with a third guy who obviously didn't make it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luke is handsome and had a lovely sounding voice, great tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A studio voice, as they might have said in seasons past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benjamin sang "All My Loving," and was pleasant though he seemed to keep running out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both were so brief it's hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, thank goodness Idol broke down the Beatles' resistance and we can hear people audition from their catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASHLEY RODRIGUEZ -- The producers are probably bummed she doesn't have some heart-tugging back story because Ashley has everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was attractive, charming, at ease and while sheshowed a lack of imagination by choosing Alicia Keys' "If I Ain't Got You," she sang it very very well.Easily the ringer of the day and one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TYLER GRADY -- Drummer who broke both arms when falling out of a tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cool jeans and mellow, early Seventies vibe without looking like he was playing dress up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charming and sort of sexy though not traditionally handsome, mostly because he had self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sang "Let's Get It On" decently, but he seemed more of a showman than a singer to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But definitely a winning personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MIKE DAVIS -- Nice guy who thinks working on a speedboat that takes tourists out for a spin in the harbor is "the best job in the world." Other than being an American Idol, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sang "Yesterday," in a dutiful, slow and deliberate manner that was even off-key at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon, seemingly bored, threw out a yes while he walked away for a break, Randy said no and the gals fell for Mike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didn't they already put through their token nice guy with the Italian? Very hard to justify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KATIE STEVENS -- A 16 year old girl whose grandmother has Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sang a fine version of "At Last," though the trills she threw in seemed more Mariah Carey than jazzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But appealing and sweet.JOSHUA BLAYLOCK -- This is the cute guy with mannered hair (too much gel) who was deemed too nice by Simon and the rest, so they encouraged him to get a little more defiant and confident andstrident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically for this first night, they were joking with the contestant rather than making a joke of a contestant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joshua was funny and indeed very nice and had a decent voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, in a later shot his hair seemed devoid of the gel and he looked much better already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Could be a comer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JUSTIN WILLIAMS -- This is the guy who fought off cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good-looking in a basic way, he sang "Feeling Good" in a style that was pretty mannered to me and rough when he transitioned from his normal range to the falsetto and back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not that clear to me that he can sing particularly well, buthe looked like another Michael Buble and they put him through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSA MORA -- Fine looking young guy with parents from NIgeria who are living the American dream. (More inspiration from Idol !) I thought he was solid, though Simon's "boring" did strike a chord with 1 of 5 Billie Jean King Repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Is a Big Deal Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our TimeDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS johnston in playgirl kardashian christmas card miley cyrus lap dance video sarah palin michelle obama shania twain More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com John Boehner Strikes Back Against Sarah Palin Amanda Knox Court Makes Crucial Ruling Like 257 Like 155 Ask Steven Tyler a Question!

He said, "Of course I'm proud of you!" But what a shame she had to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So a very upbeat Idol with 32 people heading to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A tag at the end of the show urged people to go to the American Idol website to see all 32 people who got through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought, finally! They're finally going to post all the complete auditions of everyone who got a golden ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as of Tuesday night, Ican't even find photos of all 32 Boston winners, much less audition video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're fools if they don't postthem, but they haven't yet so why should anything change now? So who did you like from Boston? And was Kara just trying to get on TV by saying one of the male contestants needed to be spanked?
