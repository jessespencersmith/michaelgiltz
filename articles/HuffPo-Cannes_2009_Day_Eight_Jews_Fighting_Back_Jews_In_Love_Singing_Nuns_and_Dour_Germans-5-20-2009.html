And then the applause was mild, polite and quickly over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throughout the rest of the day, it became clear I was in a distinct minorityon this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EYES WIDE OPEN *** -- This Israeli film is about an Orthodox Jew living in Jerusalem, a butcher who has just reopened the meat store after his father's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got a dutiful wife, a couple of kids and the deep respect of his community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until, that is, he takes in a young OrthodoxJew who seems lost and adrift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The younger man quickly proves useful in the store but word filters back from other communities that he is bad news, a sinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what is his sin? One man intriguingly describes the man has having performed too many mitzvahs (good deeds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The simple truth is that the man is gay and was in love with another man who has rejected him and yearns to follow a respectable path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can see where this is headed, I assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's delivered with restraint and respect and perhaps a little fear for the tightly knit, stifling world of the Orthodox Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is safety in such uniformity, such closeness but you pay a very heavy price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their burgeoning love is contrasted with the scandalous neighbor who continues to court a young woman who loves him even though she's been promised by her father to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The community is relentless, evenviolent in destroying this love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And we realize by implication how utterly beyond the pale the loveof these two men would be if it were known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A solid, well-told tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just don't expect a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SISTER SMILE ** -- This French film is the latest to tackle the live of The Singing Nun, the Belgian one-hit wonder novelty act of sorts who had a massive hit single with "Dominique." Debbie Reynolds played her in a film in the Sixties, but needless to say it whitewashed the real story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The real Singing Nun was apparently a lesbian who at first struggled with her sexuality, rebelled againstthe Church, left her order and even the Church, and even wrote a song celebrating the Pill.That didn't go down to well at the Vatican, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very conventional, TV movie sort of film, this movie could be shown on TV without any cuts, despite a sensationalistic story that has alreadybeen at least one other feature film, a campy Off-Broadway play and a musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cecelia de France is winning as Jeanine Deckers, the Singing Nun aka Sister Smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She plays her from high school (where every girl in sight seems to have had a crush on her) to her death, which in this version ispreceded by the climax of her positive personal acceptance of being gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a gesture typical of the film's moderate tone, we see her strip down to her bra to seduce a man (after leaving her order, mind you) but when she finds true love with a woman it's depicted only with a chaste clasping ofthe hands and a quick kiss on the knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bit tame, but intriguing almost despite itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gay audiences -- especially lesbians --should find the story fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE WHITE RIBBON * 1/2 -- The dour, austere Michael Haneke manages to out-bleak himself with this tale set right before the onset of WW I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, a small town is beset by a string of disturbing crimes, including a suicide, the torture of a mentally challenged boy and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gee, could it have anything to do with the local kids who travel in a pack, always appearing on the sceneof misery and asking with the utmost concern if they can help? And might that have something to do with the fact that their fathers are without exception unbelievably sadistic and cruel? When they're not raping their children, they're beating them. (That's not an exaggeration.) That's the set-up, the plot and the resolution of the film which no more explains WW II (they behaved evilly and voted in Hitler because their parents were such shits?) than it explains what the heck it was trying to illuminate beyond the obvious fact that beating your kids is both wrong and perhaps damaging.People threw a fuss over the Lars Von Trier film because they found it disturbing, which is like seeing a John Waters film and complaining it was in poor taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Von Trier's film was a fantasy with a stylized, over-the-top tone that kept the cruelty at a theatrical, unreal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nastinesson display in this film, in contrast, is deadly real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haneke doesn't need to justify his film to me butit would have been helpful if he'd justified it to its characters and given them something, anything, an insight perhaps, to hold onto when all he gives them is an open palm slapping them across the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Related News On Huffington Post: Heath Ledger's Final Performance Screens At Cannes CANNES, France — Heath Ledger's zeal roused his co-stars to up their game in his final film, and his death inspired them _ and three...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Queen And Anne Hathaway's White Queen: FIRST LOOK (PHOTOS) The Tim Burton...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Sanford: Where Is He?
