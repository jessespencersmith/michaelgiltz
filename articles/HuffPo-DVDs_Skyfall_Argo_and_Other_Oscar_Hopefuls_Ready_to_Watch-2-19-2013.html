                <p>DVDs: Skyfall , Argo and Other Oscar Hopefuls Ready to Watch A slew of Oscar hopefuls hit shelves just in time for you to check them out before the awards show on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skyfall ($39.99 Blu-ray combo; MGM) Argo ($35.99 Blu-ray combo; Warner Bros.)Anna Karenina ($34.98 Blu-ray combo; Focus/Universal)The Sessions ($29.99 Blu-ray; Fox Searchlight)The Loretta Young Show 100thBIrthday Edition ($99.99 DVD; Timeless) -- The greatest James Bondfilm of all time resides only in our mind.It's some sort of platonic ideal thatcombines a clever gadget or two, a BondGirl of breathtaking beauty and actingchops to boot; a tremendous villain that is both genuinely threatening and real, intense drama, excellent set pieces that are both viscerally thrilling and well-acted a la Harrison Ford in Raiders and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skyfall comes darn close though I'm a little surprised as to why this particular Bond should have finally broken through into the category of mega-franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know earlier editionswere blockbusters when you adjust forinflation, but still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh and I almost forgot:a great theme song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That to me is whereSkyfall joins the all-time Top 5 for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie should have been nominatedfor Best Picture and Best SupportingActress for Judi Dench, but it absolutelydeserves to win Best Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Argo is pegged to win Best Picture and it already feels like a pleasant movie that has been over-praised a tad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fun,though I thought there was a scene thatwas too much with Alan Arkin and JohnGoodman back in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, itdeserves more notice for Ben Affleck's May 2, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 02/19/2013 5:55 pmdirection (which wasn't nominated) than as a movie overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't get me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itcould remain on my ever-changing best ofthe year list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But The Master and Amour and Django Unchained , to name three, rank much higher and will age well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anna Karenina made bold choices in its presentation: The movie is "artificial," with actors sometimes performing theirscenes onstage, at other times wandering"off set" and revealing backstageequipment and ladders and fake wallsand the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While it added little to thefilm, I found this essentially fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theproblem, unfortunately, is with thecasting and the sprawling nature of thenovel which doesn't condense well into afilm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This same team making a ten-hourminiseries would unquestionably producea better work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for me Keira Knightleyand especially Aaron Taylor-Johnson arenot right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taylor-Johnson in particular is an actor I like very much but is wholly unsuited to the role of the magnetic Vronsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jude Law is better as Anna's cold husband but that's not enough to make the movie any more than acuriosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For heaven's sake, read the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For one brief moment, The Sessions seemed like an Oscar juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JohnHawkes fell by the wayside but HelenHunt snagged yet another nomination forher work as a sex therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothingsucceeds like success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both actors notablycame from TV, where Hawkes achieved a high profile on Deadwood and Hunt became an Emmy favorite on Mad About You.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once upon a time, crossing back and forth between TV and film was seen as hard anddefinitive. (If you headed to TV, your film career was over.) That was certainly the casefor Oscar winner Loretta Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She headed to TV in 1953 and enjoyed massive success inan anthology series that ran for eight seasons in various formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set -- The LorettaYoung Show 100th Birthday Edition -- contains more than 60 hours of television drawn from the more than 160 episodes she made, offering comedies and usually inspiringdramas about women facing an issue or crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Young won multiple Emmys and nevermade another feature film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at least we will always have her twirling at the start ofevery episode to show off a new dress and reading inspirational passages from the Bibleand other texts at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A different era, to say the least.The Perks of Being a Wallflower ($24.99 Blu-ray; Summit) North Sea Texas ($27.99 DVD; Strand) Hipsters ($29.95 DVD; Kino Lorber) Our Paradise ($21.99 DVD; Breaking Glass/QC Cinema) -- The Perks Of BeingA Wallflower is a very faithful adaptation of a coming of age novel put out by MTVas the first book in its publishing imprint.It was an auspicious choice that struck achord with teens and has sold hundredsof thousands of copies ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theflaws of the book are on full display in thefilm (it was directed by the author),including earnestness and the feeling thatthe person living it has never read acoming of age tale before and so what isby now familiar cliche is presented as ifit's a fresh insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the excellent castraises the material, with Emma Watsonsubtle and good as the object of desire,Ezra Miller good in the difficult role ofthe increasingly flamboyant gay teen andLogan Lerman exceptional as our ratherpassive hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another film with gay storylines is North Sea Texas , the long-awaited feature film debut by the talented shorts director Bavo Defurne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here he delivers an atypically realistic, quiet coming of age tale, as opposed to his Pink Narcissus-like fever dream shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A festival favorite, it didn'treach a wider audience but Defurne's talent deserves one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also worthy of more notice was Hipsters , a light Russian film that shows teenagers rebelling -- for a time -- in 1955 Moscow.The movie has fun mocking Russiancinema styles and -- continuing the gaytheme -- there's a subplot about acomrade who'd like to be more than justcomrades with our hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Our Paradise is strictly for the gay festival crowd, though it is a good showcase for director Gael Morel (whostarred in the classic Wild Reeds and hassince directed a number of films) andactor Dmitri Durdaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Game of Thrones The Complete Second Season ($79.98 Blu-ray; HBO) Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome"($34.98 Blu-ray combo; SyFy/Universal)Naked City: 20 Star-Filled Episodes($24.98 DVD; Image) Weeds 8th and Final Season ($39.97 Blu- ray; Lionsgate) Nurse Jackie Season Four ($39.97 Blu- ray; Lionsgate) Hats Off to Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss: Collectors Edition($59.99 Blu-ray; Warner Bros.) -- Game Of Thrones improved notably over season one, so maybe it's adamant fans will cut me some slack this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still notnearly as rich as the novels the series is based on, but that should improve once they spend two seasons tackling the storylines of each book rather than just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, the main reason season two is better is that Peter Dinklage gets more screen time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's not that they'veimproved in so many areas, just wiselyplayed to their strength (and the plot ofthe books).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Blu-ray set is loaded withextras and looks terrific, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andit's a lot more fun to binge watch theshow so you can keep all the rivalriesstraight in your head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome is a series designed to be seen on the web in brief bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those webisodes have beencollected onto one set, which is handy.But keep in mind the source -- this is ofthe highest quality when compared toother web-only shows but not up to thestandards of the classic reboot fromwhich it sprang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, you can't helpwondering what if for this prequel setduring the first Cylon War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ah well,better to leave well enough alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naked City is one of TV's early notable dramas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sort of the Law &amp; Order of its day, with shooting on the streets of NYC adding immensely to the realism of itscops and robbers storylines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essentiallyan anthology, it changed stars repeatedlythroughout its tentative five year run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TheDVD releases have been just asscattershot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you haven't bought anybefore, this set takes a grab bag ofepisodes notable for cameos by soon to be famous stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If we're not going to get fullseason sets, this is as good a randomapproach as any and at least gives you 20episodes out of the 138 they made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A solidsampler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weeds never quite maintained the critical notice of its first season (unlike Breaking Bad).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mary Louise Parker hasconsistently had fun and if you've stuckwith it all the way, you surely want to seehow it all turns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it would havebeen much better off with a shorter run.but then you could say that about just anyTV series you can name that lasted morethan five seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still bizarrely labeled a comedy, the blackly humorous drama Nurse Jackiecontinues to give Edie Falco one of themost complex heroines on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It tooshould start eying a finish line, but you can understand how hard it is to give up a vehicle with such a rollercoaster of a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, they've been collected repeatedly in various versions, but here you get most of the Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss specials (and all the bigones) on Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also rather pricey,even though you get nine specials in all.But for the content itself, you can't beatThe Cat In The Hat, Horton Hears AWho and How The Grinch Stole Christmas, three classic TV specials and surely some of the best adaptations of apicture book we'll ever likely see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justwatch the movies again if you want to bereminded what a blessing these are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Thief of Baghdad ($24.98 Blu-ray; Cohen Film Collection) Laura ($24.99 Blu-ray; FOX) Die Hard 25th Anniversary Blu-rayCollection ($59.99 Blu-ray; FOX) The Complete Adventures of Flash Gordon ($19.98 DVD; Image) Julius Caesar ($29.95 Blu-ray; Olive/Paramount)Don Giovanni ($29.95 Blu-ray; Olive/Paramount)Les Miserables ($29.95 Blu-ray; Olive/Paramount) -- Cohen FilmCollections is the first release of a newimprint devoted to releasing the classicfilms and shorts in its library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TheDouglas Fairbanks version of The Thief OfBaghdad is a corker and a promising launch to the series, given its finerestoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extras are modest butpersonally I'm more concerned about thequality of the film and they deliver here.it's as good as I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laura is one of the all-time noir champs and contains an iconic performance by Clifton Webb, though Dana Andrews is exceptional and Gene Tierney lives up to both the build-up of Laura and the exclamation that the actress was the most beautiful woman in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This print is a solid transfer by Fox and worthy ofthe film's pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've never seenthis mystery, in which a detectiveinvestigating a murder falls in love withthe woman that was killed, you're in for atreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Die Hard is a very fun movie that launched a franchise that has struggled ever since to maintain the standards itset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bruce Willis is always fun but giventhe harsh reviews for the latest version,you're probably better off sticking withwhat you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Blu-ray set containsthe first four films but don't be surprisedif the only one you re-watch is theoriginal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm a big fan of the old movie serials that used to run for weeks and weeks beforefeature films, each episode about 10 or 15 minutes long and invariably ending witha cliffhanger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always thought theyshould be packaged together in boxed setsat a bargain price and that's exactly whatImage has finally done with the threeFlash Gordon serials starring BusterCrabbe in The Complete Adventures OfFlash Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get all three complete serials on four discs, which run to morethan 13 hours! Plus they're presented in anice full color hardback set with a bookletthat contains imagery from the originalcomic strips. it's a pity the booklet isglued to the case but this is an exemplaryset at a terrific price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of sci-fi andFlash Gordon in particular shouldn't hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you've got kids, it's really fun to dole them out rather than gobbling them up all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bring on more serials! Three reissues of flawed but notable movies round out this section: Julius Caesar features John Gielgud in this stiff 1970 version starring Charlton Heston. it pales compared to the Brando versionfrom the 1953 but it's fascinating to seeGielgud assay the same role after 17 yearshave passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don Giovanni is an adaptation of the opera by Joseph Loseythat is strictly for buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And LesMiserables has been filmed many, many times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This French version from 1958stars the ideal casting of Jean Gabin asJean Valjean, excellent casting but not anexcellent film despite the Victor Hugo-likerunning time of 188 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photographic Memory ($27.95 DVD; First Run Features) Undefeated ($24.99 Blu-ray; Weinstein/Anchor Bay)Bully ($29.99 Blu-ray; Weinstein; Anchor Bay) -- Filmmaker Ross McElwee of thedeeply personal Sherman's March felt alittle estranged from his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So naturally he headed out and made another movie!Photographic Memory, the latest chapter in one of the more idiosyncratic careersin documentary filmmaking, showsMcElwee heading back to Brittany toexplore his own childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Undefeated is the heartwarming, Oscar- winning film about high school football players and the volunteer coach whobelieved in them as players and as men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Hoop Dreams, but shorter and more sentimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Bully is the hard-to-argue-with documentary film that says bullying is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, but one can't help feeling the movie is preaching to the choir andisn't quite the game changer for thosewho actually do bully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, one can hope. ***** Most titles listed here will be available inmultiple formats and in multiplecombinations, including DVD, Blu-ray,digital download, video on demand,streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The format listedis the format provided for review, not allthe formats available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is often the mostexpensive version with the most extras.Do check individual titles for availabilityin all their various guises and pricepoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals theindustry take on entertainment news ofthe day and features top journalists andopinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz athis website and his daily blog .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews andhis radio show, also called Popsurfingand also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs and Blu-rays with the understanding that he would beconsidering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally,he does not guarantee to review and hereceives far more titles than he cancover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz</p>
