She wrote songs, played in an art rock band called Bob;s Your Uncle and ultiÂ­ mately moved to Toronto, Lee's TV appearances include The Newsroom and Sliders in the US She has a major role in Thorn Fitzgerald's 3 Needles, Lee is certainly proud of the project, which was a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And though a very savvy woman, Lee is a bit shocked when she looks ahead to aU the attention.
