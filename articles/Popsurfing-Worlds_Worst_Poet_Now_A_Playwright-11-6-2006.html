                <p>M O N D AY, N O V E M B E R 0 6 , 2 0 0 6World's Worst Poet Now A PlaywrightFellow IRA cineaste member George Robinson (the author of the newcritically acclaimed book "Essential Torah") pointed me to this story inThe Scotsman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently, William McGonagall has often been namedthe worst poet in the history of the world and now they've discovered aplay he wrote called "Jack O' The Cudgel." It's bad too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One lecturer atGlasgow said, "Seldom has there been a writer of such indefatigableambition, singularly unmatched by even a smidgen of talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There'ssomething a bit cruel about the repeated reprinting of McGonagall'swork." Ouch.McGonagall was also a terrible actor: he once played Macbeth butrefused to leave the stage after his character was killed till the audiencefinally dragged him off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another time his bad acting caused a riot untilhe was banned from trodding the boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He famously once walked toBalmoral Castle to try to get Queen Victoria to name him poet laureate.He failed.If this isn't the basis for a movie, I don't know what is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I see BillyConnolly in the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a bit of his poetry, in case you thought theywere exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From "The Tay Bridge Disaster" -- "Beautifulrailway bridge of the Silv'ry Tay/ Alas! I am very sorry to say/ Thatninety lives have been taken away/ On the last Sabbath day of 1879/Which will be remembered for a very long time."POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 4:46 PM 2 C O M M E N T S :Ed Sikov said...The Goons, perhaps needless to say, found him heroic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's the subjectof Spike Milligan's film THE GREAT MCGONAGALL, costarring PeterSellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately the film is godawful.3:45 PM Michael in New York said...I should have known that from your book but it slipped my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AndNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: World's Worst Poet Now A Playwrighthttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/worlds-worst-poet-now... 1 of 37/28/09 3:21 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SAaronBiboyMichael in New York POPSURFING.COM: World's Worst Poet Now A Playwrighthttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/worlds-worst-poet-now... 2 of 37/28/09 3:21 PMPOPSURFING.COM: World's Worst Poet Now A Playwrighthttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/worlds-worst-poet-now... 3 of 37/28/09 3:21 PM</p>
