(Though Rat sure can leap across some mighty chasms.) Hicks employs awonderfully grounded palette that makes the Nameless City vividly real -- this is no fantasy, though there is no particular real world equivalent at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaidu is appealing, but not a stock hero in waiting; Rat is resourceful, but not so plucky you can't imagine her getting hurt and the other characters follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the vistas Hicks offers up are truly eye-catching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anexcellent launch to a new series. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Faith Erin Hicks breathes life into her characters with gale-force winds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nameless City makes you feel everything its heroes are experiencing inside and out, from adolescent angst to the scrape of terra cotta tiles under a leaping boot."
