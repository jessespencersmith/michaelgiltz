                <p>Theater: The Show Must Go On! BarryManilow Opens on Broadway MANILOW ON BROADWAY ** 1/2 out of **** ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAMES THEATRE What drama! Laid low by the flu, old schooler trouper Barry Manilow had to cancel shows and delay his Broadway opening night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with the legendary Clive Davis and legions of devoted fans in place, he finally hit the stage on Tuesday night and belted it out as best hecould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not since Hugh Jackman has there been a show on the Great White Way as critic proof as this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before his illness, Manilow was packing them in and hitting grosses that rankedalongside mega-hits like Wicked and The Book Of Mormon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, the chance for fanilows to see him in the relatively intimate setting of the St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Theatre is a powerfullure and whatever critics say, they'll keep coming as long as the show keeps extending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a tricky night to review since Manilow was clearly not at full steam or at times even half steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His voice was sketchy and intentionally mixed low into the sound system so that the music and the backup singers could carry him as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a real pro, though and always engagingly modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he pulled off a big note, Manilow wouldamusingly make a face of self-deprecating surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He apologized repeatedly, urgedpeople to come back again soon (when his voice would fully recover) and worked his voicewith skill, making the most of what he had. (And dashing off stage for a second towardsthe end of the evening, only to come out sounding -- briefly -- stronger than he had theentire night.) Did it matter to the fans? It did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They yelled and screamed and sang along and listened to the old stories and old jokes with delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manilow said at the start he was sosick, "I coughed up enough phlegm to float Fire Island. " Later he joked (sort of) that hewas the Justin Bieber of his era. "No seriously," he said. "Ask your mother." To which thewoman sitting behind me responded to her seatmate, "Don't worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's here!" At 69-years-old, Manilow wouldn't have the voice he had in the 1970s even at the best oftimes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he's a showman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even when he's done singing or runs out of breath on a song, the arrangement builds to a crescendo and Manilow flings his arms out wide atMay 1, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 01/30/2013 7:52 amthe musical finale as if he's just hit a high C and the audience loves it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without irony, Manilow says the audience will probably know every single song he's going to sing that night and isn't that amazing? "Not many people could say that," he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is schmaltz of the sort Hugh Jackman might winkingly refer to or Martin Short out and out satirize but it comes across somehow sweetly or perhaps endearingly boastful fromManilow, who's been a pop music fixture for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got 25 Top 40 hits and almosttwice as many on the Adult Contemporary charts, a radio format where Manilow isconsidered the most popular artist of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he promised to play them all (in a knowing nod to Judy Garland), from "Looks Like We Made It" to "Copacabana (At The Copa)" to "I Write The Songs" to "Can't SmileWithout You." (Actually, we sang that last one for him.) While most of them are notstandards as such (that is, songs that are covered regularly by other artists), they are very durable pop songs indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given Manilow's strong album sales in the last few years with his tributes to the 1950s and so on, this was not a nostalgia fest as such but a victory lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What it wasn't, unfortunately, was any attempt to shape a serious show that would make the artistic case for Manilow that he deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musically, you might have chosen just abare stage with Manilow and a Steinway (like the one he famously bought with his hard-earned dollars early in his career).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or you might go the other route and bring on a fullorchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But all they did was take his touring band, plop them on the stage and turn upthe volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arrangements were dull and obvious (though some of this might havebeen compensation for his voice), the look was threadbare and I doubt they even botheredto whip up a new costume for Manilow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larry Amoros is credited with "special material" but in general there is no attempt to deliver anything other than what you might have seen from Manilow on tour a thousand times before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The confetti cannon at the end (noticeably skimpy on confetti) and the very weak graphics that flash behind him throughout the night are touches that simply won't do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When theyshow a video clip of waves crashing on a shore during an otherwise strong vocalperformance of "Even Now," you realize that they weren't really trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those lazy gesturesovershadowed his strongest moments, like a video duet with himself (a la BarbraStreisand), a very sweet "I Am Your Child" from his debut and a key song from hismusical Harmony .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a pity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His catalog is strong enough that Manilow could have delivered somethingspecial and made this stand not just another stop on his tour but a genuine event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Notthat his fans will agree with one word of this; they'll leave happy and humming the tunesthey've known for so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, I'm playing the CD Ultimate Manilow while I write this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're coming up on the 30th anniversary of his 1984 masterpiece 2:00 A.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paradise Cafe; is it too much to hope he'll play even smaller spaces, like a genuine jazz clubs, and do that one justice?
