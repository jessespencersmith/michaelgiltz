                <p>N F{ {'1 =3:1oz ctz Do Tfte learners By Chip Kidd Scribner, $26More mad men in Chip Kidd's new novel BY MICHAEL GILTZ hip Kidd's breezy second novel continues the adventures of Happy, a bright-eyed child of the '50s plunged into the world of advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We first met Happy in 2001's "The Cheese Monkeys," the story of his "...: college career marked by a deltghtfully unsta- ble friend named Himitlsy and a dominating, I inspiring graphic-design teacher named Winter Sorbeik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't need to read "The.Cheese Monkeys" to enjoy "The Learners," but why wouldn't you? Now it's the ear- ly '60s, and Happy has finagled his way into the run-down New Haven, Conn., ad agency where Sorbeck began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happy is thrilled about his first real job, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might not be able to recognize the difference between Hel- vetica and Bodoni Bold, but you'll still enjoy his obsessive references to fonts, as well as the thrill of coming up with a slogan for a footwear company ("When It Comes to Buckle Shoes ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a Shame You OnlyHave Tlvo Feet!").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the firm he works at provides more mentors for ourpliable hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The characters' outlandish names - which even Dickens would have blushed to use - set the right, whimsical tone.Mindyou, there are some dark shadows, including suicide, the closeted world for gays and especially the famous yale .experiment h which volunteers proved all too eager to follow orders and give violent, painful shocks to fellow test subjects, Happy is sucked up in that experiment and deeply disturbed by how he behaves during it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Franlly, Kidd is muchmore convincing with the screwball aho- sphere than the brief moments of soul- searching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's probably not a sur- prise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The darkness is reallyjustthere for contrast, and some fi ely vomiting ensures a slapstick finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kidd is, of course, a famous design- er of book covers'for other authors, and the design of "The Learners" is especial- ly inventive and clever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why didn't he tell this tale in a graphic novel? Perhaps that would have seemed too close to his dayjob? Or perhaps he just wanted to prove he could do just as much with words as he canwith images? Mission accomplished though, happily, we haven't heard the last from Happy.</p>
