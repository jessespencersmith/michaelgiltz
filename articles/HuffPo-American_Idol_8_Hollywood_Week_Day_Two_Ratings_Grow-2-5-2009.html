It's poised to be the #1 show on TV for the fifth straight year and only one other show in TV history did that: All In The Family from 1972-1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No other show has been #1 for five years in any way. (Scroll halfway down this Wikipedia entry to see the list of #1 shows by year.) The Cosby Show and Gunsmoke were #1 for four years in a row. 60 Minutes was #1 for four years, just not in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And is there any doubt Idol will be #1 next season as well? By that standard, American idol is the biggest TV hit in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other records are far away: Gunsmoke ran for 20 years, 60 Minutes was in the Top 10 for 23 straight seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But still, there's no getting away from the fact that Idol is a behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a show that big always has controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Magazine reports that ringer Joanna Pacitti has way too many ties to Idol producers and a track record that would give anyone pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When people complain about contestants who scored a record deal but went nowhere, for example, I always counter: have you ever heard of them? It's not like Gwen Stefani is getting in line toaudition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sure, I'm very wary of people who've had substantial success or even shot at success.And Pacitti lived in the same building as two Idol officials, called one of them her manager and best friend, appeared on an MTV documentary, had a major label record debut, and had songs played Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Jeremy Michael Sarver and Broadway baby Adam Lambert got some air time as well before making it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course what I can't help remembering was Tatiana, who is easily the most annoying, tiresome person on the show (and doesn't seem to have a very good voice, either).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She wrecked havoc on twoteams by jumping from one to the other, showed true star potential by making every conversationand discussion about her , kept singing after the judges told her to stop and yet still got through -- at which point she wept and prayed and thanked Jesus for getting through the round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The horriblynamed Team Compromise had Nathaniel and Kristin and poor Nancy Wilson, who had to endurecrying and weeping from her teammates when all she wanted to do was rehearse, only to forget thewords when they performed Duffy's "Mercy" and watch the two kids go through while she was senthome and then be portrayed as the baddie for being angry with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I won't remember are the performances by a bunch of people I got glimpses of throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final group fighting for the Top 12 slots is bigger than ever (36, I believe) which means it's even harder for us to get to know them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may be one reason this season feels so frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why oh why don't they just drive tremendous traffic to their website by posting performances online over the weekend? It's literally impossible for them to create a storyline of some sort and show tons of performances in one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I get it -- the show would not be improved by just showing song after song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's no reason to hide those performances from us either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did anyone stand out for you? Was anyone sent home that surprised you? Or do you just want to hiss at Tatiana? (See, I complain about their focus on drama but I can't help talking about her.)

(And I totally agree " Nancy Wilson wasthe only bit of sanity in that trio " she should have stayed or they all should have gone, no matterwhose dream it is.)
