                <p>ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT REVIEWS EDITOR'S PICK FILM Capote • Dlrected by Bennett Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony Pictures Classics Truman Capote cut a florid figure late In life, offering up sharp-tongued bons mots on TV talk shows and generally spending more time in the gossip pages than at his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People who know only the Capote who dismissed author Jack Kerouac with the memorable slam "That's not writ­ ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's typing" could be forgiven for thinking Capote was just a celebrity, not an artist who revolutionized journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie Capote should enlighten them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unquestionably one of the best movies of the year, Capote details the signal triumph of Capote's long career-the reporting and writing of In Cold Blood, a remarkable best seller about a multiple homicide in Middle America and the men who committed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book exploded concep­ tions of what was possible in nonfiction, and the openly gay Capote influenced writers and re­ porters for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the center ofthe film is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Capote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoffman has wowed us repeat­ edly in movies like Boogie Nights and on Broadway in such productions as lllng Day's Journey Into Night so we expect brilliance .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capote could easily be portrayed as a vain, silly figure-­ played for laughs, as gay men, especially "sissies," so often are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Hoffman exhibits the keen intelligence and seductive empathy that helped this exotic creature win the trust of informants as disparate as high school girls, the head of the investigation, and, especially, killer Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), a miserable outcast with dreams of artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Hoffman's side is Catherine Keener as Capote's childhood friend, writer Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbi rd).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ke.ener is having a career year, thanks to her warm and sexy turn in the sweet comedy The 40-Year-Old Virgin and now her superlative work here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capote asks Lee-who's 100 I October II, 2005 www.advocate.com played as a lesbian, albeit implicitly-to come with him to the Kansas town where the murders took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There she almost literally opens doors for him, helps type up his notes, and serves as the anchor for his budding talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keener defines supporting actor here, and her work keeps Hoffman's risk-taking grounded in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to imagine Capote succeeding as well without Lee, and it's hard to imagine Hoffman succeeding as welt without Keener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So much of the film works beautifully: the production design; the sharp black-and­ white photography; the subtle score; and the delicate dance between Capote and Smith, the killer Capote identifies with, wins over, and then lies to repeatedly in order to main­ tain the flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First-time feature film director Bennett Miller (who helmed the documentary hit The Cruise) triumphs completely here, as does first-time screenwriter Dan Futterman (Will's onetime boyfriend on Will &amp; Grace).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here they've excelled at that most difficult genre of film: that which captures an artist at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching it, we can see they're artists at work as well. -Michael Giltz THE ADVOCATE</p>
