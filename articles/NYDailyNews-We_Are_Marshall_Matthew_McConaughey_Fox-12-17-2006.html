(\) '0 C :0 U) MOVIES IN POSSESSION Matthew McCon· aughey(l;jand Matthew Fox play coaches struggling to rebuild a college, snda town, from despalrafter -, tragedy In uWe Are,Marshall." In 1970, West Virginia's Marshall University suffered the worst air disaster in college sports history when a plane went down and killed 75 people, including virtually the entire football team, the coaches and many boosters and school officials from the town of Huntington, WVa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1971, against all odds -and even against the misgivings of some towns­ people still grieving -Marshall began the daunting task of playing football again, Just taking the field seemed like a victory, and that story is told in "We Are i'Y'arshall," a drama opening Fri­ day that stars Matthew McConaughey as Jack Lengyel, the new coach who ar­ rives in a shattered town, and Matthew Fox as Red Dawson, a surviving coach racked with guilt for having given up his seat on the plane before takeoff, McConaughey, 37, has been a star since his first major film, 1996's John Grisham thriller "A Time to Kill," land­ ed him on the cover of Vanity Fair af­ ter the Texas native spent years doing small roles in "Dazed and Confused" (1993), "The Texas Chainsaw Mas­ sacre: The Return" (1994) and "Lone Star" (1996)_ Pennsylvania-born Fox, 40, jumped to fame in 1994 as the oldest sibling among a family of orphans on TV's "Party of Five," and in 2004, four years after "Party" was over, he resur­ faced on the hit ABC show "Lost" The two Matthews recently sat down to jaw with the Daily News about sports, whether telling a true-life tale was a burden or a privilege, and to share their favorite athletic moments . [To Fox] You've joked that you know you're growing up when they ask you to play one of the coaches instead of one of the players, FOX: Yeah, it makes you feel a little old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I was glad to get back on the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was also kind of a relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd been shooting the film for a while be­ fore we shot the football scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd done a lot of the real story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it was fun to throw the ball around and have all the kids out there_ [To McConaughey] And Matthew, you'd been looking to play some sort of leader or teacher for a while, right? McCONAUGHEY: I dIdn't know it was going to come in the form of an actual coach, But coUege sports on down, I re­ alized you are more of a teacher than a coach: You have to be more of the la­ ther figure, the big brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a kid goes in there who has a great ability and runs a sloppy route, he needs his face mask grabbed and have his ass chewed out A kid goes in there who doesn't have great ability, who runs as hard as he can and misses the baU, but he's stiU tryin' -he's the one who needs an arm put around him, [To Fox] Was your greatest athletic experience breaking the streak at Colum­ bia University, where you had been a wide " ----------i ·-~~-lONE STAR I McConaughey I most recently , starred In "Sa-: .: hara" (top, "11th \ I his ex_girlfriend , Penelope Cruz) \ 1 and "Two for I I tile Money," , : with Al Paclno. t . , ~---... ---....... ,---'" receiver In football? McCONAUGHEY: What'd you do? What streak did you break? FOX: I was part of a Columbia team that was setting the longest losing streak in NCAA history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I was recruited , it was already 20 games deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We finally -my se· nior year -ended the losing streak, by win· mng our homecoming game against Prince· ton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was 44 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCONAUGHEY: 44! So you were 0 and 24 leading in? Well, well! FOX: It was rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's the great thing about football and any kind of team sports: You learn so much from that that you apply in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly, I learned a lot about perseverance and believing in yourself and working hard and playing un· der intense adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when we won that game, the fans came out of the woodwork .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was a three·day party. [To McConaughey] And you're a golf fanat· ic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's your greatest athletic moment? A hole In one? McCONAUGHEY: I've had four hole in i FOUND ON TV : Fox was the , eldest sIbling On "Party of Five" : (top, wIth Paula ': Devlcq) and now leads a group of plane crash SUr. vlvors (Including , Evangeline Ully) : on ulost.ft , ones! My first two were II days apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eleven days apart, man! And one I made in this tournament where whoever made the hole in one wins a brand· new Subur· ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no one had ever made a hole in one at the tournament -but I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then I found out: There never reo felt compelled to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McCONAUGHEY: Me, too, [Leans over conspiratorially] But I didn't tell my agents! [Laughs] I wanted to make sure they negotiated all right, but as soon as ally was a Subllrban! [Laughs 1 People wanted to take 'em to court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were like, "You know what man? Y'all han· dIe it and get the money to the Elks Lodge or whatever. " So it was like a big insurance scam and there never really was a truck. they closed I was like, "I"m in." It's sort of a privilege and an honor to be part of something that is bigger than myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox says that he 'felt compelled' to do the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One thing that was cool for me -[turns to Fox] I don't know about you -but we were portraying real pea· pIe. and dealing with a trag· edy that they had in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We could have had that weight -W·E·I·G·H·T -of responsibili· ty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I never felt that; it was almost [To Fox] You've certainly waited a While to make the leap to movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obvious­ ly, with TV success on "Party of Five" In the '90s and now "Lost," you've had all sorts of opportunIties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What made you finally say yes to this one? FOX: Sometimes I'll read scripts that are really well executed but I just don't feel it And then with ·We Are Marshall," I just like it was lighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After we talked to the townspeople. our minds and hearts were true and they were embracing that and it was a privilege more than it was a weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOX: I totally agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the most amazing experience .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And my first one out of the gate! It's all going to be downhill from here .• ( "</p>
