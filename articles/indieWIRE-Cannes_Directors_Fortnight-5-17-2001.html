It's harder to get a bead on which of its movies are catching the fancy of fest goers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some trends are clear: the Directors Fortnight is usually more successful at offering popular opening and closing night movies and this year is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The opener­ "MarthaaMartha " by young French director Sandrine Veysset -has enjoyed respectable reviews for its depiction of a none·too~fit young mother (Valerie Donzelli) who mayor may not hurt herself and her child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While generally not considered as strong as her debut "Y aura·t·iI de la nelge a Noel?" ("Will It Snow For Christmas? "). it still has some strong female performances and the benefit of being very French indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The closer -Amos Kollek's "Queenie in Love" -hasn't been widely seen yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this auteur. who films regularly in New Yort&lt;.. is deeply admired in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I watched in astonishment last year as his trifling, bland romantic comedy "Fast Food, Fast Women" received rapturous applause when it screened in the main competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since "Queenie " is apparently in a similar vein, there's every reason to expect a similar reaction. (Cannes is nothing if not loyal to its directors.) If./I~( 1H( AClI% 10 TlH P'ROH~)lOIiAlS ,IF P (DISCUSS) I need yoo, feedback aOOuI t , :t.Q!.!!lg F'm lover! Sandwiched between those two are some promising entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But first, on to the American movies: Ethan Hawke's "Chelsea Walls" was roundly dismissed, though Robert Sean Leonard' s charming singing voice does lead one to fancifully hope he and Ewan McGregor will record a duet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faring better was Arliss Howard's debut "Big Bad Love." Based on the short stories of Mississippi writer Larry Brown, it stars Howard as a bitter Vietnam vet who's been rejected by his wife (real-life spouse Oebra Winger) and by agents uninterested in his fiction, Shambling and overlong (which hasn't generally been a problem this festival, whem many movies have clocked in well under two hours), "Big Bad Love" develops some well-earned power once mal tragedy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; II even earned some comparisons in the trades to Ed Harris's "Pollock." Even stronger feelings emerged for "The Deep End," a well· known quantity since it has appeared elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tilda Swinton stars as the ideal mom if you're planning to come out as a queer and a killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the lover of her gay teen son washes up on the beach, she takes care of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even blackmail from a stranger (Goran Visnjic) is a mere bump in the road for this tigress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. also featured prominently in two French documentaries. "La Traverse e" ("The Crossing"), by French director Sebastien Lifshitz ("Come Undone"), is a modest, politely received look at a young man convinced by a filmmaker friend to go to the U.S. and try and lrack down the American G.t. father he's never met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much less successful is Solveig Anspach and Cindy Babski's woeful worK "Made in the USA." This would-be "Thin Blue Line" awkwardly attempts to convince us that convicted killer Odell Barnes is innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In doing so, it also tries to condemn the American system of justice and indeed America itself. "Made in the USA" begins with a description of the crime and Barnes's execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Desperate for images -since Odell remains mostly off-screen -they pan from a clock to a prison wall while a voiceover solemnly describes what is happening inside the prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other random shots of the streets of the small Texas town repeat throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Virtually no one they speak 10 is articulate or interesting -not the prosecutors, not the defense, not friends or family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The evidence in Bames' favor Isn'llerribly convincing either -even for an adamant anti-capital punishment person like myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, by the end of this tiring film. you don't even CARE whether Barnes suffered a miscarriage of justice: you feel like you're suffering through one yourself. little better was"' Noslrl Annl" ("The Years of Our lives"), --~ ,-~ -.--.~.-, ~,--_.-----.. ~, .. --,~ _._------_. -~ --_. --'--",nlcn a tf:lli\lV&lt;:I1 Ulrf:!Clor pruuUlY lil:UU "'&lt;IS &lt;lCCt!plttU &lt;:Iii lItuen for Its visual look as for its "political potential." That should nave been waming enough -and this black and white story of old Italian men remembering their days I'lghting in the resistance during World War II only confirmed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Made on a shoestring and it shows: the flashback scenes of actors running through the woods and clutching their guns are especially unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also disappointing was "Hushl" from Japanese director Hashlguchl Ryosuke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His earlier drama about gay youths- 1996's "Like Grains of Sand" -was convincing, if eamest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This follow·up tells what should be a lighthearted story: two young gay men in Tokyo (one out to his family and coworkers; the other closeted) are approached by a female friend who wants them to help her have a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryosuke maintains a deft touch for the first 10 minutes or so, but it takes him forever to set up the basic premise of the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worse, he reverts to heavy·handed drama with uninvolving subplots about the death of a relative and a cowor1&lt;er of one of the gay men who becomes obsessed with marrying him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The light tone retums briefly towards the end, but it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even gay audiences won't have much patience for this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain to do much better at the box offICe is the sentimental if effective "Pauline et Paulette: by Belgian Lieven Oebrauwer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This gentle drama shows what happens to the mentally challenged Pauline when one of her sisters dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The will stipulates that all the money goes to the care of Pauline unless one of the other sisters takes her in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paulette does, only as a slop gap measure of course. and some laughter and tears and hugging ultimately ensue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well-acted, it's the sort of f~m thai might be unbearable in English but seems eaSier to swallow in a foreign tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two other films received more mixed reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christine Jeffs highly anticipated "Rain" Is a New Zealand entry (al"\d thus probably feels overshadowed by the hoopla for that other NZ·based production "The L.ord of the Rings.") Set In 1972, it tells of a disaffected teenage girl who sets out to seduce the photographer boyfriend of her mother. 1\ was generally relegated to the catBgOl"y of "pmmising," though some trades pegged it to gain a ~mited artnouse release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even fainter praise greeted Khaled Ghorbal's "Fatma: a look at the lives of women in Tunisia. like the Inexplicably praised main competition film "Safar e Gandehar" ("Kandahar"). it seemed admired more for its politics than its filmmaking .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But one Cinderella story did emerge from the Directors Fortnight: "Slogans," the first Albanian film to appear et Cannes, was rightly described by a presenter as a "miracle" that popped up at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tightly directed by Gjargl Xhuvanl, it deftly mines the humor and pathos of a young schoolteacher who arrives in a tiny mountain town In the late '70,,-One of their main tasks -even more Important than teaching, it seems -Is organizing the students into groups, taking them into the hills and spelling out revolutionary sk&gt;gans with heavy rocks they must then paint white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teachers out of favor with the local politicos naturally get longer slogans, meaning more backbreak ing work for their kids, What's most admirable is the movie's refusal to exaggerate : we see the pettiness of people in power, but they're not made to be buffoons or overly evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more painfully. we see the heartbreaking compromising of the teacher (and everyone around him) just to get by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes the bleak, unhopeful ending -which simply reflects the reality that life goes on -all the more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To top it off. ·Slogans· even had one of the best-reviewed parties of Ihe entire festival, thanks to Albanian punch, stuffed vine leaves and other specialties .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes. dreams really do come true, [Michael Glitz writes regutarly for the New York Post, The Advocate, and other publications .}</p>
