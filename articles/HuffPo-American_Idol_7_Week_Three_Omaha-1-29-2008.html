Group them by city and/or alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nineteen people went through in Omaha and I for onewould gladly watch them all. (As far as I can tell, they don't do this currently.) Only so many actscan get airtime, so this is the best way to give everyone a chance to find a favorite AND second-guess the judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it would only build interest in the Hollywood round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine onlinecommunities urging their friends to check out a particular audition and how that would give peoplea rooting interest in what are now just faces glimpsed briefly in a montage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank me later, Idol.On to the auditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Bernheisel -- this is where Idol walks a really tricky tightrope between toying with people's dreamsand celebrating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris is super-enthusiasticabout the show, brings gifts, is totally exuberant andcan't sing worth a lick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smartly, Idol knows it would be like kicking a puppy if they made fun of him, so they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges instinctively know the same and treat him sweetly and insist that he shouldwork the red carpet for his local FOX affiliate for the finale. (An easy enough promise that coststhem nothing.) Chris is over the moon and the show is off to a nice start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

In fact, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You shouldn't mess with a winning formula too much, Paula became more comfortable criticizing the singers (thousands of awful auditions will do that) and the hosting job isvery technically demanding and one that Ryan prepared for his entire career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it was a goodidea and for a moment I got to see it come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samantha Sidley -- she sings the Norah Jones standard "Don't Know Why" (penned by Jesse Harris) and she's okay but so tentative and breathy it's hard to believe she could sing in any othertempo or deliver a pop song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan is mocked for criticizing her presentation (Samantha keepsrotating her body while singing) but in fact Paula and the others say her "showmanship" needswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uh, what's the difference between that and her presentation? Another "yes," but it seemshighly unlikely she'll go far unless Hollywood boosts her esteem like steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon pricks mybubble by joking, "It actually would be horrible doing this with Ryan." Then we get three shortened auditions, hearing 30 seconds or less of three different singers who get a golden ticket, including Elizabeth Eckert (seemed pretty good), Denise Jackson (solid pipesand confidence to spare) and Michael Sanfilippo (whose shaggy hair and decent looks guaranteesome modest pinup appeal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The funniest moment is watching a girl with a golden ticket headeddown the escalators and insisting proudly to the camera that she is "America's next top model!"before dissolving into laughter over her reality show mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angelica Puente -- this is the girl who has been fighting with her father and actually lives with her grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idol mends broken families! Simon mangles her last name -- I know he doesn't like Bob Dylan but doesn't he at least recognize the surname of Tito Puente? I don't have an ounce of rhythm in me but even I can pronounce that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She belts out Celine Dion's "The Power Of Love" with an emphasis on "belts." She gets a "yes" but seems so overwhelmed she'll need lots of confidence-building to get ahead in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook -- a rocker of sorts, though rather shy about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sings "Living On A Prayer" in a raspy, very sloooow version but is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His worst attribute is an awful, rooster-like haircut with some dyed red streaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would he be willing to cut it off for Hollywood? If so, he could go far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnny Escamilla -- he sings "Shout" in a glittery, foolish shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes you know someone won't get through before they've sung a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't.Then there's a montage of people singing "Stuck In The Middle With You." (Appropriate since it was used brilliantly in Reservoir Dogs and I'm sure at times the judges would love to cut their own ears off).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I often wonder how these bits are done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do they ask the people to sing this song afterthey've done their official auditions and been rejected? Do they provide the lyrics? Leo Marlowe -- finally it comes down to the last audition of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's usually a good sign if Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos(VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

I hope he was outing himself since he seems gay and Idol is overdue for an out contestant. (It would be a huge advantage if you were gay and open, Leo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just saying.) He did a solid job on "A Song For You," though he pushed it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he took the time before Hollywood to lose a little weight and tone up (Hey, I need to lose a LOT of weight Leo, so I'm not throwing stones) then we'll know he's serious about this and not just having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So who were the stand-outs for you? And if they were available, would you go to the American Idol website and look at the auditions of winners that didn't air?
