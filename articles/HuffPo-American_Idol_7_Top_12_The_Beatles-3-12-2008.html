"Say hello to our new set, America." Hello, set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, it's animprovement but still not quite as flash as the set for Simon Cowell's UK equivalent "The XFactor." (I love how that show flashes the contestant's name all over the stage.) But the "mosh pit"where audience members can stand and groove along to the songs is a great addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On thenegative side, why strand the bandleader on his own little alcove far away from the othermusicians? Stupid and dangerous when it comes to the subtle communication they need to adjuston the fly to a particular performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan also said the Beatles -- I mean, "the Lennon/McCartney Songbook" (sorry, George) -- is exciting because John Lennon and Paul McCartney are responsible for more Number One hitsthan any other songwriters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one else is even close in the rock era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Beatles alone had 20 #1hits so he may be right but I'm still checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan asked Simon if these songs were difficult andSimon said, "It depends which one you choose," with his usual blunt finality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Made perfect senseuntil he said if you chose "She Loves You" it's easy and if you choose "Yesterday," it's hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh?Actually, "She Loves You" seems easy but has all sorts of tricky high parts if you really want tomake it work and "Yesterday" is a dead simple melody -- it's not one of the most covered tunes ofall time because it's super hard to sing, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha Mercado -- Sang "Got To Get You Into My Life," which wasn't even released as a single till 1976, long after the band disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire did a terrific cover two years later that also went Top 10 and Syesha took her cue from that, adding in lots of horns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't dig her hair and she had a very rough start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But once she hit the chorus she got stronger and she ended very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, by theend of the show, when they did the recap I was a little startled to hear her because I'd totallyforgotten her performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I've got a crush on her! Always dangerous to be forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

I'm a Beatles fanatic but why choose a song that 98% of your audience won't even recognize? Even before he began I pegged his song choice as a complete disaster -- when you've got one of the most well-known song catalogs in history, one bursting with tremendous tunes, don't choose a relative rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he began singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The arrangement reflected the early skiffle days of the Beatles, with some banjo thrown in. (Has Chikezie been listening to the terrific new Otis Taylor album, Recapturing The Banjo? That's where I learned the banjo came from Africa.) Then the song began rocking out and Chikezie was looser, funkier and more entertaining than he'd ever been before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only flaw in agreat moment was Ryan dancing around like a dork at the end, encouraging shenanigans andgenerally infantilizing Chikezie by rubbing his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Help them look cool, Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they seem hyperfrom the adrenaline rush, help them get control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three judges were wildly enthusiastic, ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His best performance yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramiele Malubay -- Sang "In My Life" from the landmark Rubber Soul album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boldly, Ramiele began the song on the stairs looking UP, kind of a fun change of pace that worked well, until shehad to get back down to the ground and wavered a moment on the steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too often, I've found heranonymous and a diva ready to throw in tons of trills and runs to no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She still didn't showme a lot of personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for once she kept it simple and straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, she gotpilloried for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy and Simon were bored and even Paula said she was waiting for some vocalgymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, no, we don't need another Mariah Carey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To top off the injustice, Simon eventhought the John Lennon classic was a boring song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disastrous reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When all three judges slamyou, you are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Castro -- Sang "If I Fell" with just an acoustic guitar, a so-so voice and a lot of charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tune originally appeared on the A Hard Day's Night soundtrack in the UK and on Something New in the US, serving as the B-side to "And I Love Her." (Told you I was a Beatles fanatic.) Lovely tuneand Jason coasted through, but he's very lucky a lot of people were worse than him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very rough onthe high notes and at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Simon said it sounded like a student sitting in theirbedroom at midnight, a lot of fans thought, "Gee, that would be fun to be in a bedroom at midnightlistening to Jason sing." Sex appeal counts for a lot folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula said, "I can feel your heart" andRandy was negative but Simon was vaguely positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That and charm should keep him safe, butthose weak vocals will catch up with him in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I'm not mistaken, Simon trashed this songtoo as dull; I know Simon can't handle Bob Dylan but does he hate the Beatles too? Carly Smithson -- Sang "Come Together" in a pretty traditional arrangement, despite promising she would change things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lennon's last #1 hit with the Beatles, off their best-selling album Abbey Road (12 million copies and counting in the US.) I still don't like her piercing high notes (they sound weak and a tad shrill to me) but this is a very good performance and I haven't been afan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think to myself, "Gee, someone should give her a record deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, wait...." On top of thedeserved praise, Simon goes into overdrive for Carly, saying that she reminds him of KellyClarkson, who gave a breakout performance the same week in season one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly, one of his goalstonight is to build up the other artists and stop making David Archuleta seem so inevitable oraudiences will get bored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before introducing David Cook, Ryan is seen leaning over whispering to Simon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since he was looking up at a monitor, I assume it was a planned bit of silliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no matter how many times Iplayed it back, I couldn't quite hear all of the first sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan is whispering, "The crew thinksyou're..." and Simon rears back and says loudly, "No, I would NOT!" and then Ryan says, "No, butI think they think you're becoming obnoxious." David Cook -- Sang "Eleanor Rigby," off Revolver , which combined with Rubber Soul to send the Beatles into the stratosphere creatively, setting them a galaxy apart from every other act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook pulled the same stunt as last week, giving an emo makeover to another mellow ballad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It workedwell again and he ended very strongly on a rocker's yelp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he can't pull the same trick again nextweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he still has that unintentional habit of looking very pleased with himself, that Daughtryattitude where he seems to be thinking, "I am such a badass for rockin' out on Idol ."

One more stab at not making the show seem a foregone conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin sang the heck out of this tune, though I'd give a slight edge to Brother Ray if I had to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke White -- Took off her shoes, sat down at the piano and sang "Let It Be." Nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do Carly Simon and Carole King realize their love child is coming on strong on Idol ? The song is the title track from their raw second to last album which broke down in recriminations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They then got together to record their final album Abbey Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Producer Phil Spector stepped in and dug through the tapes to come up with an album that was technically released last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And thedocumentary film showing their backbiting has unfortunately been held up for years; I've nevereven seen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges fall over themselves in praise, even though Randy confuses poor Ramielleby praising Brooke for basically singing the song straight, just like she did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference? Brookedid a good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tearing up at the end of the song didn't hurt in the endearment department either.By the way, Ryan said this was the last single from the Beatles, but I believe it was actually "TheLong and Winding Road." (That ignores tunes released years later like "Got To Get You Into MyLife" and the patchwork job "Free As A Bird" and "Real Love" in '95 and '96.) Joan Baez was thefirst to have a hit covering this song, though I favor the great Bill Withers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hernandez -- Sang "I Saw Her Standing There" and looked cute with an untucked shirt and tie but it was basically a train wreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He ran out of breath while running in and out of the audience and was weak on the low notes and the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tune was the B-side to the Beatles'breakthrough US hit "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and was a big hit for Tiffany, who changed thegenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he's gonna go down for this, I kind of hope he sings the Tiffany version when he saysgoodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he shouldn't have to go; Hernandez has a great voice and I still thought he was sort ofentertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges trashed him -- even Paula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amanda Overmyer -- Sang "You Can't Do That" from A Hard Day's Night in the UK and The Beatles' Second Album in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another relatively obscure choice that I immediately peg as bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She should be doing "Helter Skelter" or "Back In the USSR" or something tough but well-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So of course she delivers her best performance so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn't understand half the lyrics, but that's standard operating procedure for Amanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a competent performance and the judges loved her so she'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most interesting of all: Amanda didn't change the gender of the song, so she was singing, "If I catch you talking to that boy again" and "Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him." Did Amanda just not bother changing the gender, was it too awkward to sing "her," which wouldn't rhyme with "sin" in the next line? Or did Amanda just come out? (I don't think so.) Michael Johns -- Sang "Across The Universe" nicely and simply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite one rock star moment of lifting up his hands into the air, very controlled and emotional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His best since singing "Bohemian Rhapsody" during Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I havent' been a fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges however were mostly bored.Randy and Simon poo-poo it, while Paula felt his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My favorite cover of this song was SeanLennon, Rufus Wainwright and Moby singing it at a Lennon tribute show in October of 2001, oneof the first events to be held in the wake of 9-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee Cook -- Sang "Eight Days A Week," y'all! She also do a sort of line-dance, riding-a- bull sort of move while singing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second train wreck of the night, the song comes from Beatles For Sale in the UK and Beatles VI in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weak, anonymous vocals throughout and a very weak final note and the judges body-slammed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta -- Sang "We Can Work It Out" and gave another brilliant performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? You say it was a disaster? Sure he forgot the words and stumbled around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, even before he sang -- when the camera spotted him on that garganutan stage when going to commercial -- Ithought, "Gee, he looks young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And small." But the David Archuleta train was going to fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'vegot to stumble so you can recover and not be so boring that people just don't bother voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SoDavid picked a perfect week to be just awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you wait too long and give your bad performancewhen there are only four or five people left, you might just get sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But doing it tonight,enough other acts were bad (but none worse) to guarantee that David will be given a free pass fromhis huge fan base and get to work his way back up to indomitable favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smart thinking, David!How bad was he? The audience barely booed when Simon said David was awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also dredgedup some mannerisms from his Star Search days, including a diva-like bobbing of the head and those gospel singer hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But how smart is he?

Hope you don't mind my making a few clarifications on Beatles trivia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let it Be (b/w You Know My Name -- now THAT would have made an interesting selection to cover) was in fact the last "official" Beatles single, notwithstanding, as you mentioned, post-breakup releases circa 1976, Free As a Bird, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let It Be was released in March 1970, a month before the generally accepted breakup date of April 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Long and Winding Road was a U.S-only 45 (b/w For You Blue) released in May 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given that it's AMERICAN Idol, and that the show and the Beatle's American label, Capitol, are both based in Hollywood, somewhat ironic on Ryan Seacrest's part to go with the British release dates and album listings, i.e., You Can't Do That presented as "from (EMI-Parlophone's) A Hard Day's Night" instead of Capitol's bogus Beatles' Second Album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at least he was consistent throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And one minor correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stevie Wonder's version of We Can Work It Out (along with Jimi Hendrix's version of Day Tripper, my personal all-time favorite Beatles cover) was recorded and first released on Stevie's Signed, Sealed &amp; Delivered LP in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It came out as a single in 1971, not 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for the great blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking forward to next week's entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And evidently, due to popular demand, they're extending the Lennon-McCartney songbook tribute for one more show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fab! DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink One minor technical point, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Jackson didn't buy the Beatles catalog "at auction." He stoleit! -- by outbidding Paul behind Paul's back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul admits since that he obviously regrets giving a lowball bid to ATV (the corporation that owned the "Northern Songs" which licensed a majority of the Lennon- McCartney cannon) for the songs but, make no mistake, Jackson's was unscrupulous by buying the rights out from under Paul, who (supposedly) was his friend at the time of the purchase back in the mid '80s Charity See Profile I'm a Fan of Charity permalink So NOT impressed with Brooke or David Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thought Cook screeched his way through the haunting (when done by The Beatles, i.e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul McCartney on lead - incidentally, he wrote it, too) "Eleanor Rigby."And Brooke, can she sing any other way but in that style? I certainly don't think she deserves theOUTRAGEOUS praise that Simon gives her week after week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very uncharacteristic of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also donot get Jason Castro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Michael, while I enjoyed your column, "She's a Woman" was a big hit in Miami at the time it was first released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, both "I Feel Fine" and "She's a Woman" got pretty much equal play at the time(I'm almost 60; saw the Beatles live at the Gator Bowl in "64.) Additionally, "If I fell" is on my original soundtrack of Hard Day's Night, released in the U.S. at the time of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have all the Beatles' albums on vinyl, bought at the time they were first released in the U.S., including the ones not previously waxed on Capitol Records (Verve Records, I think - my albums are packed in a box right now; I've recently moved or else I'd pull them out for reference.) As for the film "Let it Be" I think I've seen it about three or four times - when each Beatle film was released my friends and I always made sure we sat through as many showings as we could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thosewere the days when you weren"t asked to leave the theater when the showing was over. "Let It Be"played, if memory serves, in the Shores Theater in Miami Shores, Florida, when it was first released in1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yeah, if I recall, you can cut the tension with a knife in some places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gig on the roof alsofeatures Beatle women in the background as audience, if I recall - Yoko, Linda, Maureen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yoko'spresence in the film was especially telling at the time and indicated that yes, indeed, the Beatles dreamwas over. (I am not a Yoko-hater, btw.) DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink Not Verve Records, that's strictly a jazz label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most likely you're thinking of the VJ (aka "Vee-Jay") label, a long-defunct R&amp;B label out of Chicago that released a couple Beatles LPs in theearly days of Beatlemania, including most famously "Introducing the Beatles" with the iconicDezo Hoffman sepia cover shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I am, in fact, a Yoko-hater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't believe the revisionist post-Lennon assassination spin, she WAS more singularly responsible than anyone else for breaking up the Beatles, more Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:08 AM on 03/13/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:28 AM on 03/13/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:26 AM on 03/13/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 12: The Beatles http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_91081.html [4/5/2009 7:28:27 PM] than Allen Klein, more than Brian Epstein in absentia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She hasn't exactly redeemed herself, either, in her narcissistic controlling of the estate and legacy of Lennon and her stake in the Beatles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charity See Profile I'm a Fan of Charity permalink dcdan, yes, Vee-Jay - couldn't recall it offhand. in regard to yoko, you're leaving out free-will on lennon's part. yes, yoko literally pushed her way into the life of john lennon (i'm also referring to the anecdote of her pushing her way into his limo) but at any point he could havepushed her right back out, and, ostensibly, continued on as part of a singing/writing four-some. but with two colliding egos the size of lennon and mccartney, the break up was inevitable. at the time that all of this was going on, those of us out in "fan-land" didn't have much of an idea as to how serious the situation had gotten; a lot of the intricatedetails were learned a step or two later, or in some cases, only to be divulged in the books that were written several years later. i recall in 1970 during the break up of reading a "rare" one-on-one interview with mccartney where he could barely contain his contempt for lennon - and it was a real first glimpse as to how incredibly hatefulthey were to each other. i remember a friend and i discussing this along the lines of "wow, we knew it was bad, but didn't realize how bad...." i most likely still have that news article saved among my beatle memorabilia, boxed up with the rest of my things. i used to save anything published about the beatles. at any rate, i have long since given up any fan-hatred for yoko. perhaps if she had come and gone in john's life, i would have thought more harshly of her. but she was,in the end and to the end, john's soulmate and from that came a burst of john's owncreativity and his penchant for riding on the razor's edge. also, please don't underestimate the effect linda eastman had on paul mccartney or the effect eastern religion had on george. ringo always seemed to go along for theride. but all four men were distinct talents, with good and curious brains, and thebreak up their formative group was inevitable. yoko can be seen as the tear in the fabric to which john tore through to escape what he - and paul - were both feeling as stultifying to both of their creative and personal needs. i didn't like beatles break up either, but as a 45-years long fan i have long since given up "hating" yoko ono for the "break up" of the beatles. it's time to get over it. ======================= There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Luciana See Profile I'm a Fan of Luciana permalink Or maybe Amanda's boyfriend in 'You Can't Do That' is interested in another guy?

"Give me Love" by George Harrison is one of my favorites and is not that tough to play although some might find it so. capo third fret. "Dear Prudence" perhaps one of Lennon's best ballads is difficult and most people might want to tune their guitar down a whole step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best Regards, G&amp;M Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink "You've Got To Hide Yor Love Away" is easy to sing and play, but it's not easy to get that little bit of swagger that makes the "Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way" actually work. "Here Comes The Sun" is a brilliant song, easily one of my Top 5 but it and most of the others you mention were George harrison tunes as you know and therefore not available whensinging the Lennon/McCartney songbook. "Dear Prudence" might have worked well for Jason,don't you think? Thanks for the perspective on what's easy on the guitar. mglred See Profile I'm a Fan of mglred permalink How do you sing Eight Days a Week as a country song and not be booted off? I'm amazed!

(See below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boot "em Group (in no particular order)1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hernandez: The performance seemed very karaoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was embarrassed for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges said it was overdone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think he is a favorite to go home tomorrow night. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristy Lee Cook: The worst performance of the night horrible, horrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She turned the Beatles, Eight Days a Week into a BAD country style song that verged on sounding like Polka music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think sheshould get the boot or maybe even jail time for ruining that Beatles song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, I think the countryfans might save her with dials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was by far the most painful to watch tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ugh!!!

Would it have been too meta to wear the Manson t-shirtlike Axl Rose in the video for "Estranged"? The real tragedy? That they could only do Lennon/McCartney stuff, leaving perhaps some of the greatest songs the Beatles EVER did, like "Something," the always overlooked "Old Brown Shoe" or"While My Guitar Gently Weeps." The difference? Harrison owned all his own publishing, while the Lennon/McCartney stuff was bought at auction by Michael Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever notice how whenever you hear a news story about MJ having money trouble, in the ensuing months you get a lot more Beatles songs being licensed in commercials, etc?

Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I kind of thought Michael Johns might tackle "I Am The Walrus." You make a great point about how dangerous it is to pick songs where the Lennon-McCartney vocals intertwined andplayed off each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, I think the songs are great enough that you could do a final soloversion of say "If I Fell," it's just that Jason Castro has a very thin voice no matter what he'ssinging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I kind of hoped Amanda would do "Helter Skelter" or even "Why Don't We Do It InThe Road," just for shock value. "Old Brown Shoe" is a charmer, right up there with "Two Of Us" in the small category of overlooked Beatles songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DemandTruth See Profile I'm a Fan of DemandTruth permalink Ah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Damn good songs, all! I wonder if they had all these songs to choose from, and if they get to listen to them done by the Beatles before they choose?
