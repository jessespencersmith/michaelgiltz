                <p>I I #&amp;.- i sif di lilr J li terown Lesley Gore is on her second run o Ever Since By M ichael Giltz pparently, it was worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lesley Gore was a teen sensation, hitting number 1 with her very firsl single (the thunderous "It's My Party') and scoring with other hits like the protofeminist anthem'You Don't Own Me." She's also been nominated for an Oscar afber cowriting (with her brother Michael) the classic stan- dard "Out Here on My Own" for 1980's Fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gore hadn't recorded a new album for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now she is out with.Euer Since (available exclusively at her Web site), and the reviews have been ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times calls this collection of intimate acoustic pop "mature and wistful," The Washington Posl says it is "welcome and enjoyable," and AllMusic.com deems her CD "subtle and brilliant." Gore's gay fans are just as thrilled to see that her being out-something obvious to those who saw Gore ably serve as a guest host on the TV series In the Life-is now acknowledged by the mainstream media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of her mentors-Bella Abzug----encouraged her to be more public, and Gore took it to heart, saying yes when the PBS show approached her. (Another clue? The times she would open her act in San Francisco by making a play on an Elton John hit by say- ing "Don't let your son go down on me.") 'When I do get to parts of the Midwest, people did come up to me and say, 'Thanks for doing that [show],'" says the 59-year-old singer-songwriter. "They just want to be validated and know that they're human be- ings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's been a nice thing and I'm happy I did it." Still, while she's OK with being pubiic, Gore isn't ready to bepersonal-don't expect coming-out stories or even how she met her partner, a jewelry designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Core is more comfortable talking about "Better Angels"-a track from Euer Since- being featured prominent- ly in the season premiere of CSI: Miami. "It was utilized beautifully," she beams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's pleased to acknowledge what she's been open about with family and foiends since the'70s. 'TVe're talking about this, but I've been with the same partner for 24 years," says Gore. "This is just an oppor- its highest, even Gore's Jew- ishness was off-limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She didn't realize she was gay )tunityforme to kindor.ut.r' Ot 24yeafs,... un.wi,th myself I'm not,cam- lrm a mUSiCalpargnlng. rm a musrcar per- When her stardom was at want my li e to January L7, 2OO6 www advocate com TH E ADVOCATEMUSIC until she was ensconced at Sarah Lawrence College, where it was "easier to be Joan Baez than Lesley Gore." As time passed, Gore came to be- lieve no label would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get her back into the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the digital revolution meant that when artist and Engine Company Records founder Blake Morgan approached Gore, she knew they could record an album and even make a few bucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it helped that she'd known Morgan (who produced, arranged, and wrote or cowrote several of the songs) since he was 9 years old. "I remember when Blake sat at the piano and couldn't reach the pedals, which is the problem I still have," the petite Gore says with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is easily the best album of her career, with new tunes like the witty 'Not the First" ("You're not the frst to think you'Il be the last") sitting comfortably alongside more mellow tracks and reimaginings of 'You Don't Own Me" and "Out Here on My Own." Gore could have been out more prominently in the mid '90s in connec- tion with the movie Gra.ce of My Heart, which included a subplot about a Gore-like teen idol (played by Bridgr Fonda) who was gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gore worked c the character's song-"My Secre Love"-until she was comfortable ha ing her name on it as a cowriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Br she felt wary that she'd been brougl in too late for a real collaboration, an when she wasn't even invited to th premiere, Gore was convinced the filrr makers had used her primarily fo publicity. "It turned into the opposite r what I would have wanted," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So they don't own her either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor Gore is looking forward to perhaps , live album next year and anothe album oforiginals after that. (She say she's already in the midst, or finished with seven or eight songs.) A one woman show d la Elaine Stritch is r long-held dream, and there might ever be a book down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But everl day-just as it's been for most of her Iife-the one constant is music. "When I wake up in the morning and I go to the piano and there's u blanl&lt; sheet ofpaper in front ofme, b1 the end ofthe day that could be a gold mine," says Gore. "You really do need to wake up and expect that the world is your oyster, because it very well may be." I</p>
