"IJust added an intro to the last song, 'The Song of Purple Summer,''' explains Sater. who wrote the show's book and Ivrics Bttt Broadway musicals are like puzzles, and altering one Inoment can have a cascade effect. "We needed to change the music. and then we needed to change the lyrics But we got through it." This final bit of tweaking - a luxury fOI 3 show that has been gestating for about seven years -is the favorite moment for director Michael Mayer, the TonyÂ·nomiÂ· nated force behind "Thoroughly ModÂ· ern Millie," "Side Man" and the re-being explained to them. the young people. explode into rock songs like "The Bitch of Living" and "My Junk" with lusty pleaÂ­ sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slyly pulling out a wireless microÂ­ phone to sing becomes an act of rebellion Though the music is sophisticated enough to please any Stephen Sondheim fan, Gramuly-winning musician Duncan Sheik was determined -in his first stage effort -not to try and change the subtle, Nick Drake-flavored yearning of his rock albums to fit what some might imagine a Broadway musical should sound like. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ani189f~h1V ' . ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yields Â·a;~exy :,;1."

"When Steven and I statted wlitÂ­ lllg these songs, ~ ','II [lItem live kind of rocl&lt; p81&gt;0n, J purposeÂ­ ly didn't want to write songs in a different genre," says Sheik, who has grown from the pop artist behind the hit song "It's really fun," says Mayer. "I love this proÂ­ cess \-vhere the structure is firmly in place. the perÂ­ lot mances are really solid "Barely Breathing" to deliver acclaimed albums like "PhanÂ­ and 1 can hne-tune .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's . , nllisifaV';': my favonte lime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't always get to -sometimes you're scrambling to the very last tom Moon" (another collabo- minute to try and make it work But it works. and now we're getting to linker."

" "It WflS definilely Ollr idea that the mu'ie r 'Spring AI akel'ung ' should be Ihe alrernative rock music of [he day, and to be slt icl with ourselves about not letting it turn into something more traditional," says Sheik, "There are many Broadway shows that have been intlu- . ential on me, like 'Porgy and Bess' and Sweeney Todd,' and certainly there have been recent shows that influenced us "So it's not like we're not influenced by Broadway, but stylistically, we wantÂ­ ed to make sure the music was going to be really relevant to 20-and 30-year-olds and teenagers" If the show clicks, it will be a sweet finale to a sometimes torturous journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It began with a workshop in La lalla, CaÂ­ lif â€¢ in 1999, which led to more workÂ­ shops and then a turn at the Roundabout in 2001, where plans to take the show to Broadway were deralled by Sept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I i and financial and ~11istic demands . "It was heartbl eaking at the time," says Sater, who has written a number of plays. notably "Carbondale Dreams" and, in collahoration wilh musician LauÂ­ rie Anderson. a version of "The TemÂ­ pest" "Then, after three years, times had changed .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was post-9/11 but also postÂ­ 'Hairspray.' People wanted fun. and we were a pretty dark show" But that delay proved a blessing, acÂ­ cording to Mayer. 'We really wanted to put the show on before," says Mayet: "But it would not have been as good if we hadn't had all this time Because we never stopped working All the -' time it was on hiatus, we kept adding.' And now Sheik, whose album sales of late have not matched his critical acÂ­ claim, may very well find his higgest auÂ­ dience yet in a place he never expected to be: Broadway "1 think I've learned a lot about lyric writing from Steven. because he's so immersed in the world of words." says Sheik "Steven is so prolific as " lyricist and I'm more prolific with music. so it does allow me to create a 101 more Ihan otherwise would bave "I did some albums tbat were less commercial and a bit confounding to people And even my family was saying, 'You're working on a musical'" !\nd 1001 ing at me like I'm out of my mmd," !, He laughs.
