"Mariah!" A scrum of photographers surrounded her as she walked just a few yardsacross the street and towards the beach dining area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women were crushed momentarily against the barricades as Carey got closer and closer, with the guards trying to let Carey in and keep the photographers out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barely acknowledging them, she slipped past everyone and scurried down thestairs and out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only problem?

(She also stars in the Daniels film Tennessee , which opens in the US on June 5.) Precious , based on the acclaimed novel by Sapphire, opens November 6 via Lionsgate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carey has a small but important role as a social worker and she appears in a scene with comedian and actress Mo'Nique that has a chance of garnering that actress an Oscar nomination come next January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the prominent support of Oprah Winfrey AND Tyler Perry, it's also likely to make afool of the New York Times for saying the inspirational but gritty tale was good but almost impossible to market to a wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carey is also working on a new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the press conference, she really did pose for the photographers on their way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or did she?
