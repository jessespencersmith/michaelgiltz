Lee was asked what it was like to get complimented by the judges and rambled on for about ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dude, you need to rehearse your comments just like you rehearse your performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust us, you don't want to wing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Lady Gaga did her thing: a wonderfully evocative, theatrical live performance of "Alejandro" (complete with bare-chested male dancers, fog, and a crazily eccentric costume) with the song almost anafterthought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes, she seems like Madonna without the catchy tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harry Connick Jr. did a MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Celebrity Skin | Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Like Sign Up to see what your friends like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 67 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

More lip syncing and then we found out Connick is doing a stand on Broadway in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Lynche and Aaron Kelly were in the bottom two and Aaron was sent home, head held high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nashville awaits Aaron; just give it a few weeks to dry out! By the way, apparently there are people in this world who do NOT own Frank Sinatra's entire catalog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're intrigued and want to know where to begin: For ring-a-ding classics, jump on any of these upbeat gems: Songs For Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly With Me, Come Dance With Me or Sinatra At The Sands (and for heaven's sake, skip the monologues).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For quieter, darker masterpieces, dive into In The Wee Small Hours (my favorite, at the moment), Only The Lonely and the new reissue of his bossa nova gems The Complete Sinatra-Jobim ( written up nicely by fellow HuffPoster Tony Sachs ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This very selective list is what is known as scratching the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then you've got the Christmas music,the pillowy perfection of the Columbia years, virtually everything from Capitol and on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PERFORMANCE REVIEW -- Idol celebrated Frank Sinatra by swinging the standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harry Connick Jr. was the mentor and rivals Adam Lambert as the best of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sat in with the band, did the arrangements, and put the singers at their ease while offering good advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, if he was more on top ofpop music as opposed to just jazz, he could be another great choice to replace Simon. (Ellen was also very funny this week without letting it get in the way or feel like filler; she's come into her own the last two weeks and while not a stellar analyst is a welcome, cheerleading presence.) I wish they'd done standards week around the Top 10 or 9 because it's such a crap shoot of a night and singing with strings and/or a big band is very very hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this stage, the singers should get to dig into the genres they can nail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The short video explaining Sinatra to the audience was godawful, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the clips showed Sinatra in his much later years and it was a mishmash of random images and goofy asides; none of it gave a sense of the impact he had on popular music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sinatra just invented the teen idol, the album, the concept album, the great American songbook, singers as actors, second acts, third acts, and he rivals Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and Bing Crosby in his influence on how singers sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AARON KELLY -- Sang "Fly Me To The Moon." Tony Bennett often does an acappella version in his act but it's still Sinatra and Basie's swinging spin on this song that is definitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron stepped away from his country comfort zone but wasn't able to locate any swing in his voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also seemed to do everything BUT follow the melody when you need to let people know what it is you're singing before they can appreciate any deviations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, his voice never relaxed in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges were overly polite,even the negative comments of Kara and Simon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, Aaron has never looked cuter with his swept back hair and vest and tie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since he's the only contestant anyone under 20 can get really enthused about (the rest are waaay too adult), that might just save him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASEY JAMES -- Sang "Blue Skies," which of course Sinatra covered but still seems like Ella Fitzgerald's song to me, especially the version where she starts off slow and wistful, then swings the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one can do effervescence like Ella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harry came over and joked "don't screw it up" with Caseyright before he performed, which was fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his bluesy spin was awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey looked like he was afraid to move and had TONS of vibrato, which Kara also pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very stiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Aaron, it was very forgettable and that's almost worse than being bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRYSTAL BOWERSOX -- Sang "Summer Wind," a Sinatra tune I have never really enjoyed, though I was amused by the duet he did with Julio Iglesias since it made them sound like they were singing this love song to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She wore a big dress but the casual hair made it seem not too stuffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I yearned to love it but it was just pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had some interesting phrasing at the beginning, built to a big climax and then had a nice quiet end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not her sweet spot but far better than the first two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL LYNCHE -- Sang "The Way You Look Tonight," while looking like he was in a costume for a road show of Guys &amp; Dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the others, he sounded lost on the slow parts, which is where you can really see how tricky it is to sing with an orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had a good finale with a big Idol -pleasing last note, but it all felt a bit anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges, perhaps looking to pretend the ultimate winner is not inevitable, praised him. 1 of 5 Dylan Ratigan Free Market Fraud Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, EfficiencyDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Lohan ticketed 1 of 7 camille grammer lady gaga natalie portman pregnant raven- symone snooki nude More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Thousands Of Birds Found Dead In Italy Recommend History Channel Won't Show Katie Holmes Miniseries The Kennedys READ MORE Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo to Guest Star on Hawaii Five-0 READ MORE Lindsay Lohan's Post- Rehab Gift: a $25,000 Necklace READ MORE Petra Nemcova Engaged to British Actor Stephanie Seymour Caught Kissing Her Son? Jessica Szohr Bares All in Costa Rican JungleLEE DEWYZE -- Sang "That's Life," a song that absolutely demands swagger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seemed a disastrous choice to me and not the right song for Lee at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why highlight your weakness? And I had to laugh when he sang "riding high in April, shot down in May." As with everyone, Connick gave him good pointers, but Lee's idea of swagger seemed to mainly include gesturing with his hands a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end, the songseemed to stop, and then start up again and crawl to the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it wasn't bad and after the judgespraised him I listened again without the visuals and it seemed stronger to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this stage, he seems likely to be joining Crystal in the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, in a week I found underwhelming, who will be the bottom three? I'd say Aaron, Casey and Michael with Aaron and Casey in the bottom two and Casey going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What did you think of the singers andtheir song choices? And I have a final question for Harry Connick Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My favorite albums of his are thepiano-based, casually wonderful collections of standards recorded when he was 20, 25 and 30, all of which were named after those ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So where the heck is 35 and 40 ?

The judges ALWAYS attack song selection. here is an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each week the contestent s pick a song and the judges pick a song for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stop wasting time with all the pre song interviews etc...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That way we can stop the lazy judges week after week saying "Bad song selection" rather than having togive actual critisicm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I groaned when I heard it was going to be Sinatra night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let the singers pick anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't make them sing oldies and try to make them relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know it's sacrilegio us to say this (sorry, Michael), but while Sinatra was good and had his definitive style, he’s overrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even within theRat Pack, I liked Dean Martin better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best singer of all back then was Nat King Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankwas a great dramatic actor, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then I heard it would be Harry Connick and I was ready to watch again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was the best mentor yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it would have been more of a disaster if he hadn't arranged the songs and played with them and his band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lady Gaga was sensationa l, especially the staging and choreograp hy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee was by far the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a great singer with a terrific voice, but he's been inconsiste nt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he's hitting his stride while Crystal has slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael was next best, Crystal third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey was probably the worst but Aaron was not much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I predicted it would be Aaron going home, but Michael is right that with more experience hedefinitely has a career ahead of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still doubt that Crystal will win, simply because of the teeny boppers and the Christian vote, although I don’t know who they will vote for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Casey still has a chance if he’ll get back tosinging like he did with “Jealous Guy.” Who is CHOOSING these evenings?? ? Seriously, "make it current, but here, do it with these incredibly old, awkward freakin' songs."

Knowing Siobhan, something out of leftfield or thoroughly unexpected because it would beso convention al.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe "My Way?" That captures her perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan actually said in a post-Idol interview that she would've sung "My Way"because it was her grandfathe r's favorite song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Having woos kids like these do the timeless Sinatra songbook is like having pop culture bacteriatrying to sing like God.Permalink | Share it Halsey 08:33 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:33 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER greymom 08:28 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:33 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it Tagrid 04:42 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it sportsgamer 08:02 PM on 5/05/2010241 Fans 59 Fans 311 Fans 59 Fans 2 Fans 59 FansWhen you hear the "lounge lizards" (that is my term of endearment for the old rat pack) doing the "standards " the songs are enjoyable and seem easy! It's that "ease" of phrasing, attitude and vocals that leads to a belief that the songs are simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are complex tunes and the lyrics are all aboutphrasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think these contestant s got that "standards " are very unforgivin g of errors, if you don't know what you're doing just stay away! True, but they had no choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standards night is always a toughie which is why I wish ithad come much earlier, when the stakes aren't as high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The thing that surprised me was that Connick was by far the best mentor, in the way he actuallygot in there and schooled them rather than say Miley Cyrus going "uhhhh, you should smile more".But it just goes to show in many ways how raw these idols still are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The one thing I didn't like, I thought they over praised Mike and Lee, and under priased Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that I loved Crystal, but their main critisism seemed to be that she didn't hit some big Siobanmoment at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm getting the idea that if Fantasia sang "Summertim e" this season they would have blasted her for singing a slow song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ha! That's a reminder that Siobhan killed with a standard but none of these guys did.Perhaps one more example that most people are right for finding this season underwhelming, though I still think Crystal might be special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey might be going home tonight... ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey and Mike will be in the bootom 2 with Crystal joining them to make the bottom 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The big story tonight wll be how does Crystal react to being in the bottom 3 if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's be honest....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a meltdown ready to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I personally hope Mike goes home......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somethng very annoying about a fat guy who doesn't seem to know he's fat......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he is fat......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That hat he had on made him look buffoonish .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Crystal would have loved to be in the bottom three in a way to humble her and getfans rallied and not taking it for granted.Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Deborah Beck 07:24 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:34 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it CAMBEL 05:47 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:35 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 05:35 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:36 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it43 Fans 749 Fans 59 Fans 26 Fans 59 FansThose kids were probably saying "Frank who?" Anyway, I'm like Simon -- I'm outta here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show is boring (so is DWTS) and predictabl e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no Adam Lambert "glamor".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My wife and daughter are regular "Idol" watchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never watched it until last night, and onlybecause I am a huge Sinatra fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right off the bat, let me say I thought Crystal was far and awaythe best. "Summer Wind" is a beautiful song ~ a wistful story of a romance the singer yearns torelive ~ and she did the song justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest of them, however, made some odd choices, notably,in the songs they decided to sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I totally disagreed that Michael was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sounded like he wasswallowing the ends of words, and I didn't believe him once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other than Crystal, they all looked likethey were in a bar singing karaoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, I thought it would have been very funny for Aaron to goof with the judges and audience with a fake start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stand center stage, a single spotlight on him, and sing: "When I was seventeen, it was a very good year." Then bust into, "You Make Me Feel So Young".But, that's just me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funnily enough, he sang that very line in the results show and it still made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it's ironic that the judges are always telling the contestant s that they need to be relevant and marketable , but then they have them sing Sinatra! Whoever made this decision for the show, it was a huge mistake, especially this far into the competitio n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, though of course you can sing a classic and make it seem modern and relevant too.But in general I think it shows not that they shouldn't sing standards but that the only thingthe singers should strive for is not being "relevant" but good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGSSouthJerseySteve 05:07 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Lucky123 04:51 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:37 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it kaib57 04:39 PM on 5/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:38 AM on 5/06/2010 Permalink | Share it Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 total)Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.</p>
