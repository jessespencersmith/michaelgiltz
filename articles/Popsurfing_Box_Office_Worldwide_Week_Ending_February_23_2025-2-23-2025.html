This list is meant as a handy guide to the winners and a constant reminder of how important mid- sized and small budget movies are to a healthy box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two films disappeared off my radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's possible, even likely, the German family film The Three Investigators–Carpathian Dog simply stopped making money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It only grossed a reported $2m last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the French comedy God Save The Tuche opened to $15m last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's highly unlikely the movie made less than $1m this week, but I can't find any info on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many markets remain black boxes unless the movies are big enough to be tracked by ComScore and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; India, Japan and individual European countries (not to mention Central and South America) do not offer easy and timely access to box office the way China and South Korea do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wild Robot opened in Japan and I thought it would play really well there, but as far as I know it hasn't made a penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That puzzles me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If anyone has links or suggestions of how I can track any of these markets (or any others), email me at mgiltz@pipeline.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thx! 2025 HIT FILMS Here's a list of all the hit films making money in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My rule of thumb is that films should gross roughly at least three times as much as their reported budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people now say a movie need only make 2 1/2 times as much as their budget but I'm sticking with the traditional formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, we don't really know a movie's budget or the cost of advertising or the backroom deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, just because a movie isn't a hit from theatrical alone doesn't mean they're losing money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We can't dive deep into Hollywood accounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we can spot the really big hits that will change careers, launch franchises and generally pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few international films probably made the cut but since I don't have even a reported budget, I hate to reward them with hit status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, I'll include movies from 2024 if they make the majority of their money in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here goes. ► 2023 (8) ► 2022 (6) ► 2021 (8) ► 2020 (7) ► 2019 (93) ► 2018 (34) ► 2017 (6) ► 2016 (2) ► 2015 (11) ► 2014 (2) ► 2013 (5) ► 2012 (17) ► 2011 (15) ► 2010 (10) ► 2009 (43) ► 2008 (86) ► 2007 (781) ► 2006 (2405) ► 2005 (5)3/24/25, 2:49 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING FEBRUAR Y 23, 2025 https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/02/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending_23.html 3/8Big Budget ($100mb+) Detective Chinatown 1900 (China) ($125mb est) Mid-sized budget ($21mb-$99mb) Boonie Bears: Future Reborn (China) ($50mb?)

Sadly, three times is not the charm artistically for this once-perfect franchise. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dog Man– A reported $40mb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's always good to gross your budget on opening week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, the books are funny, the reviews are good, the audience response is great and it has the rest of the world to open in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So get ready for Dog Man 2. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Monkey -- $10m reported budget means this adaptation of a Stephen King short story is a box office winner right out of the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheap horror films are money in the bank... but 2025 has so many I have to assume audiences will become sick and tired of them any minute now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not forever, not all of them, but surely the surfeit of slasher flicks will prove too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just not yet. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Detective Chinatown 1900– $125mb at least? This is the fourth in a wildly popular buddy comedy mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think oh, Rush Hour? 48 Hours? Each film cost more than the one before and grossed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since we're on film #4 and it's a period movie set in San Francisco, it's safe to assume this cost more than #3, which cost $117m and grossed $686m worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, $150mb is probably more realistic, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh and clues in this one indicate the next film in the series will be set in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, Detective Chinatown 1920, here we come . 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mufasa: The Lion King– $200mb. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Complete Unknown–$60mb+ for this Bob Dylan biopic? That's a lot of money for a film about Dylan going electric at Newport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, I wanted to see it but then I'm a Dylan fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But $180m worldwide seems highly unlikely to me, if not impossible. (Do other countries give a toss about this? Is Chalamet a big enough draw for this story? I doubt it.) I'm glad it was made, but it was made for too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Gladiator II, this will be seen as a commercial success, but it's not. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Brutalist– $10mb; Adrien Brody in this architect-as-hero period drama. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moana 2–$150mb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is the budget lower since it was intended for tv, at first? Or higher because they had to rethink everything? Disney says it cost $150mb, just like the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can bet Dwayne Johnson gets more than his share of coconuts, but that won't matter with a hit like this. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boonie Bears: Future Reborn –$50mb? This once low budget animated franchise keeps getting bigger and bigger at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Film #9 grossed $220m and #10 grossed $270m. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heart Eyes–$18mb for rom/com slash horror film. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dragon–$4mb for this Indian/Tamil coming of age comedy drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A young guy gets too clever with a crooked path to riches, endangering his job, his relationships and his family's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can he reform? Does he want to? 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sonic The Hedgehog 3– $120mb 3/24/25, 2:49 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING FEBRUAR Y 23, 2025 https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/02/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending_23.html 5/817.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wicked– $150mb for each part, so $300mb total plus beaucoup marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a big movie! And they're made almost all their money back from Part One alone. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nosferatu– $50mb for Robert Eggers, acclaimed director of The Witch, The Lighthouse and The Northman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That last film had his biggest budget and was not a commercial success, so I saw him as more of an arthouse guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But backers stuck with him, gave Eggers a big budget and a starry cast for a remake of Nosferatu, which I guess is classier than remaking Dracula but still a hard sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And opening on Christmas Day? That's counter-programming I was not behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, I was wrong and Eggers now looks more like the next Peter Jackson/Guillermo Del Toro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good for him. 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creation of the Gods 2: Demon Force–$110mb? Creation of the Gods is a live action fantasy trilogy that was shot all at once over an 18 month period, a la Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the first part cost $110m, presumably parts two and three cost at least as much, though their initial releases were delayed because of time-consuming special effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And guess what? Like Ne Zha 1 and 2, this too is based on Investiture of the Gods, making Ming dynasty author Xu Zhonglin the hottest scribe in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, there are a handful of English translations of the tales, but none of them received a single professional review and only one even has a handful of reader reviews, so I would be wary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I'm still waiting for a good translation of the epic from which Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was drawn. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conclave– a reported $20mb for this Vatican thriller means this is a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do not see the point in putting it on PVOD and flooding the market with bootlegs while potentially harming box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is exactly the sort of film that can play and play in theaters. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Becoming Led Zeppelin –Long-gestating doc broke into the Top 10 on opening weekend, playing on IMAX screens only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its second weekend, the film has an excellent hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This traditional doc (talking heads, concert footage) has already grossed $6m, which is serious money for this type of film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no reported budget, but given all that I know, it seems likely the total was $2mb or less, so this is a winner. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legend of the Condor Heroes: The Gallants–No budget available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wuxia martial arts period adventure film written and directed by the legendary Tsui Hark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's based on part of the novel of the same name by Jin Yong. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Babygirl– $20mb for this Nicole Kidman sexy drama about a powerful businesswoman ﬁnding her kink with a younger, dominating man...her intern, no less! No milk was harmed in the making of this movie. 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of Them Days– $14mb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's always good to gross your budget during a film's opening week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So yea for producer Issa Rae and this comedy starring Keke Palmer and SZA. (What an opening week for SZA! Her movie opened well and she made my list of The 250 Best Albums of the 21st Century...So Far.)3/24/25, 2:49 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING FEBRUAR Y 23, 2025 https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/02/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending_23.html 6/825.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flight Risk–$25mb for director Mel Gibson action film starring Mark Walhberg. 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm Still Here– this Brazilian Oscar contender has no reported budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's almost certainly a success story commercially for director Walter Salles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it's been a hard one to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually, the film's grosses have been less than $1m so it hasn't made my weekly chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week, the film expanded in North America and grossed $1m in that market alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far in North America it has made $2.6m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worldwide? Well, Box Office Mojo claims its worldwide gross stands at $22m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it's been opening in markets all over the world but never quite at the same time and never hitting big enough numbers to be tracked by ComScore, which only reports on the Top 10 right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That seemed like a lot so I jumped to Wikipedia, where some fan links to a story written in Brazilian Portuguese and claims it's hit $99m worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ha! Uh, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPDATE: Wikipedia comes through again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rogue editor has likely been blocked and the gross has been corrected. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Hurts–$18mb for action comedy starring Ke Huy Quan and Ariana DeBose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is no way to follow-up winning an Oscar! 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Unbreakable Boy–heartwarming family film about little boy with rare bone disease and autism but a zest for life that wins over everyone. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Den of Thieves 2: Pantera–$40mb for Gerard Butler action flick. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companion– A reported $10mb for this sci-fi horror comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great reviews means this one should have a long run at the box office. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; September 5–No reported budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OFF THE RADAR: God Save The Tuche–the fifth in the French comedy series about a lower-class family that wins the lottery and tries to crash into upper society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time, they have their sights set on the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Three Investigators: Carpathian Dog aka Die Drei ??? Und Der Karpatenhund–No reported budget. 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Secret: Untold Melody–SK drama remake of a Taiwanese weepie about a pianist whose career is cut short by tragedy...but he finds comfort from a time-traveling woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CHART AND HOW IT IS COMPILED This column is a week by week tracking of box office around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is compiled by pulling from every possible source: ComScore, Box Office Mojo, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, charts for countries like China and India and South Korea, individual stories in trade or general interest newspapers, Wikipedia and anyone else discussing box office. 3/24/25, 2:49 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING FEBRUAR Y 23, 2025 https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/02/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending_23.html 7/8</p>
