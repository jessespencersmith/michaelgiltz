                <p>Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are just crazy about the upcom­ ing Oscar awards. scar predictions and Ac~derny predilections By MICHAEL GIL1Z Do you remember what film won the Best Picture Oscar last year? Do you care? Well, maybe not (It was Pl4toon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But everyone in Hol­ lywood does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Monday night they'll all be gathered together for the Academy Awards, and even the people who aren't nominated probably secretly hope their names will be called to 'receive that golden statuette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Oscar meou,s prestige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Oscar means recognition from your peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Oscar means you_ go to the head of the line for good projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most of all, an Oscar means money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How much? ,4.rell, it depends on the films nominated and how suc­ cessful they've already been, but a good rule of thumb is that an Oscar for Best Picture can mean an extra $20 million .,t the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, if you're lucky enough to. grab a handful of major awards -an event that happens less and less as the Academy has grown fond of spreading the joy -you can expect even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As you might expect, wh~n there's money to be had, there's money to be spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studios spend millions of dollars promoting their best contenders to the small pool of Academy voters, hoping to sway them with swanky promo­ tions or even just remind the ab­ sentininded members of the films that opened up 10 or 12 months before the voting occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Furthermore, actors and direc­ tors with enough pow~ insert clauses into their contracts oblig-ing the studios to spend a certain amount of money to promote their latest flicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This results in the amusing sight of advertisements . pushing Sylvester Stallone for Best Actor consideration for his fine work in 0rJer The Top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in the end, it comes down to the voters, and no one can predict what they'll do from year to year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inevitably, there are surprises and that is what makes Oscar so excit­ ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katharine Hepburn spurns the event but has received more Best Actress Oscars than anyone else, while Steven Speilberg - who would probably do back flips if it would help his chances - can't even get nominated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who hasn't been nominated is invariab­ ly as interesting as who was, and Monday'night is certain to prove as provocative (not to mention overlong and boring) as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there is any discemable trend, it is that the Academy has grown less wary of box office success, going so fat as to give multiple nominations to the runaway smash, Fatal Attraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The follow­ ing are predictions of who will win in the major categories, as well as who deserves to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they all prove correct, I'll be even more .s~prised than if they don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PICfURE The voters are notorious Anglophiles -as recent winners Gandhi and Chariots of Fire will .. happily attest to -but the stately, intelligent epic The lAst Emperor will edge out Hope and Glory for the top award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moonstruc1c is a dark horse possibility, but its achievements are too minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BrOtUl­ CIlSt News failed to get a Best Direc­ tor nomination, greatly dimming its prospects, since the Best Pic­ ture and Best Director awards go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fatlll Attnu:tion \ made too much money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who deserves to win? (In all cases, I Ilmit myself to the nomina­ tions.) Well, The lAst Emperor, an impressive, stirring piece of work from Bernardo Bertolucci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is in the grand tradition of Hollywood and wonderfully effective to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Academy's failure to nominate the sensational leads - John Lone and Joan Chen -sure­ ly.ranks as the biggest gaffe of the _ year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Hope and Glory or Broad­ cast News would be noble choices as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BESTA€fOR Michael Douglas will win with his flashy role in Wall Street for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First and foremost, he is very much a mem­ ber of the Hollywood community with impressive producing creden­ tials (One Flew 0f1eT The Cuckoo's Nest and The Chi,..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Synd~), as well as the family tradition (Dad Kirk) to draw upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, his solid work in Fatal Attraction is still very much in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is his year, what with box office success and his'emergence as a serious actor, and they'll love topping it off with an Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His stiffest competition is from Jack Nicholson, but Ir01lweeil was too downbeat for them to pay much attention, beloved as Jack may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Hurt is also a comer, but he's been nominated a lot and won for Kiss Of The Spider .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woman in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marcello Mastroianni and Robin Williams are just happy to be npminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who should win? Well, Nichol­ son was excellent, but the perfor­ mance I enjoyed the most was Hurt's in Broadcast News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'd seem to have fallen into a rut play­ ing earnest young intellectuals, but here he accomplished some­ thing I never expected: Hurt played a believable dummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To Broadcast News, the romantic comedy from James L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooks, has made a star of Oscar­ nominated Holly Hunter me, this one role has shown that he is in it for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACfRESS Next to the Best Picture category, this is the toughest call of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meryl Streep is adored by the Academy and gave a remarkable performance in IronWeed, but it waS downbeat and they want to give her name a rest for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glenn Close is also a strong contender and her all-out, over­ the-top performance as an erotic psychotic is the kind they love to reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the winner will be Holly Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcast News was a criti­ cally acclaimed film from the much-admireclJames L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooks and this is their one chance to ~gnize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, her perfor­ mance was terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cherts nomina­ tion was a sign of respect -she'll win next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kirkland has al­ ready received her gift from the Academy and won't be expecting anything more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DIRECfOR Throughout the long history of the awards, only a handful of times have the Best Picture and Best Director awards gone separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, if The Last Emperor wins as I expect, Bertoluc­ ci will cop this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If HoPe and Glory wins, Boorman will too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're so close in the running - with Moonstruck breathing down their necks -that this ~ry well might be a year in which the . awards are split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adrian Lyne's nomination for CONTINUED PAGE FOURTE ·EN John Lone and Joan Chen were overlooked by the Academy. category where everyone deserves to win. " BESf SUPPORTING ACTRESS ~..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Th' . h ff bea -_ IS IS t e most 0 -t cate~ith a lot of interesting faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann SOthern for what amount~ to a waUC-on.in"The Whales of August?

The Academy al­ ways tries to have a little fun and thill category shows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their most worthy instance of plucking a per­ formance from obscurity was Anne Ramsey's hilarious role in Throw Momma From The Train, an otherwise wretched little film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the winner will be Olympia Dukakis for her wonderful job in Moonstruck as an Italian mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's been around for years, and, besides, her relative's high profile on the campaign trail has kept her name uppermost in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that it matters to the Academy, but she also happens to be the most deserving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BESf FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM In a year fraught with uncertain­ ty where no film has come to dominate the proceedings, this category is the clearest of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ap­ parently, My Life As A Dog was being pushed for Best Picture con­ sideration, thus splitting its votes between these two categories and failing togetnominated in either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leaves the fierd wide open for Au Revoir Les Enfants (GOodliye-­ Children), the more deserving of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on the experiences of director Louis Malle in oc­ cupiE;d France during World War II, it is a beautifully realized, per­ fect film." Yet to arrive in Gainesville, Au Revoir Les Enfants is a remarkable achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be cherished and remembered by movie lovers long after most of the other actors and movies nominated have be­ come mere footnoteS ".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that is the greatest award of all.</p>
