Yet The Hollywood Reporter headlined astory by saying Lars Von Trier 'ADMITS TO BEING A NAZI." (They should have said "tastelessly joked,"at the very most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the festival proved it too refused to take the words in the context they weregiven, denounced them and said they had spoken with Von Trier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official press release added simply,"He presents his apology." Von Trier later released his own statement via email to the media: "If I have hurt someone this morning by the words I said at the press conference, I sincerely apologize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am not anti-semitic or racially prejudiced in any way, nor am I a Nazi." End of silly controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Festival's Board Of Directors held an "extraordinary meeting" Thursday night, condemned Von Trier's comments again and declared him a "persona non grata" at the Festival, effectiveimmediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What that means exactly -- can his films come to Cannes even if Von Trier can't? -- is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the movie likeliest to cause political waves in the US -- if it can reach beyond Greenpeace fans and win a wide audience -- is The Big Fix, a new documentary film about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Josh and wife and co-director Rebecca Tickell use that man-made disaster as a jumping offpoint to illustrate the tentacles of big business stretching out in every direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They link the oilcompanies to financial firms and politicians, they show "impartial" commentators on countless mediaoutlets who are compromised in ways both large and small and they even personalize the issue of thespill's impact in a stunning manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rebecca Tickell developed serious medical issues just covering theaftermath, prompting her involvement in a class action lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The critics were generally positive about the movie, though many felt it piled on so many conspiracy theories and proved so all-embracing in its denouncement of the ways of politics and environmental regulation that viewers might get overwhelmed with details or lost in an explosion of exposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be fascinating to see if its muckraking (in the classic, positive sense of the word) mobilizes audiences theway the filmmakers so clearly long to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier in the fest, the hot doc was Unlawful Killing , a look at the death of Princess Diana that was funded by Mohamed Fayed, who has repeatedly called the death of Diana and his son Dodi a murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grisly lure for some was a photo of Diana, Princess of Wales at the accident that for the first time wouldbe uncensored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It came and went in a flash according to reporters but is sure to be online as soon as abootleg DVD gets out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In general, the movie was seen as offering some genuinely puzzling details (did itreally take three and a half hours after authorities arrived on the scene to get the still-living Diana to ahospital?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the movie did itself no favors by embracing what was described as a sensationalistic attitude and featuring talking heads like Howard Stern and gossipy author Kitty Kelley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: Who Won Big At This Year's 'Fashion Oscars'?

Cannes won't answer that question this festival butit's one more probing idea raised by the movies and politics that swirl throughout it every single year. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Buy a link here Sponsored Links Work At Home Jobs EXPOSED We investigated work at home jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What we found may shock you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HomeJobManual.com Mom Is 55, Looks 30...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clever Mom Reveals $5 Wrinkle Trick That Has Botox Doctors Furious!
