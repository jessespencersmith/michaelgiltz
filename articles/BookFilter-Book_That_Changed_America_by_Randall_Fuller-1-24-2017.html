Like Pulitzer Prize winner Louis Menand's "The Metaphysical Club," Fuller uses the hook of Darwin's book to offer a group portrait of American thinkers and writers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We implicitly understand the importance of the Theory of Evolution on science, but Fuller awakens us again to its impact on all the sciences, not to mention philosophy, literature, politics,society at large and the ever-volatile issue of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He shows how Darwin's ideas were immediately seized upon byShare This Book About The Author Randall Fuller MoreRandall Fuller is the author of From Battlefields Rising: How the Civil War Transformed American Literature , which won the Phi Beta Kappa‚Äôs Christian GaussAward for best literary criticism, andEmerson‚Äôs Ghosts: Literature, Politics, and the Making of Americanists .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has ‚Ä¶ Release Info List Price: $27.00 (Hardcover) Published: January 24, 2017 Publisher: Viking Pages: 304 ISBN 10: 052542833X ISBN 13: 9780525428336abolitionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though Darwin cautiously avoided discussing the theory's implications on the origins of people, it was obvious to everyone where his ideas led and how they reinforced the common humanity of all people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine, but Fuller then shows the dismay -- the buyer's remorse even -- of many ardent abolitionists as they wrestled with Darwin's work and how it challenged and undercut their faith, seeming to relegate God to observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller shows this passionate turmoil cutting aswath far and wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its sting is especially felt by the group of Transcendentalists and their friends, people like Emersonand Thoreau and the Harvard botanist Asa Gray (Darwin's most able defender in the US).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They wrestled with his ideas, fromthe influential thinker behind "Walden" right down to the talented young writer Louisa May Alcott, who was far readier than her well-intentioned father to see Darwin's ideas to their logical conclusion. (She wrote about interracial romance in an early novel.) Even those who fancied themselves scientists were confounded, for Darwin's approach in his book was the mostradical of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forever after, science would involve facts and data and theories that could be tested and proven, ideaswhich led to specific results (if this, then that), results that could and must be proven again and again -- and then all of itchecked independently by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was shockingly new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Philosophical musings, untestable speculations and appeals to the Almighty have no place in science and Darwin is the reason such an obvious necessity won the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Towards the end, Fuller is juggling so many characters that he gets a little lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We jump in time again and again, from well after the CivilWar to its beginnings, from one person's death to another person's signal event years earlier and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a tad muddled,but all resolves in a lovely image of Thoreau seeing the wide open possibilities, the horizon that Darwin drew everyone's eye toward for the very first time, though it was always there. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Advance Praise for The Book That Changed America ‚ÄúA vibrant history of the reception of Charles Darwin‚Äôs ideas by American minds and spirits . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fuller creates arich tapestry of personalities and roiling ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In radiant prose, and with a sure eye for the telling detail, [he] reveals the shattering impact of Darwin‚Äôs book on religious thought, scientific inquiry, and especially on debatesover slavery . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fresh, invigorating history of philosophical and political struggles.‚Äù ‚Äì Kirkus Reviews (starred) ‚ÄúIn this inventive work, which weaves two powerful events into a vibrant tapestry of antebellum intellectuallife, Fuller beautifully describes how the engagement by a group of Transcendentalists with Darwin‚Äôs newly published On the Origin of Species deepened their commitment to the antislavery movement. . .Elegant writing and an unusual approach to interpreting the time period make this a must-read for everyone interested in CivilWar-era history.‚Äù ‚Äì Publishers Weekly (starred review) ‚ÄúCharles Darwin's Origin of Species burst upon America at the same time that the nation was descending into‚Ä¶ More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
