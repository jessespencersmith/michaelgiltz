Arthur Bryant wonders if the answer lies inthe mythology of the Thames itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the normally wobbly funhouse corridors of Bryant’s mind have become, of late, even more labyrinthine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venerable… Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say This is lucky number 13 in a long-running series about a detective duo of a certain age who are the heart and soul of London's Peculiar Crimes Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before reading one of their tales, I had the mistaken impression that Peculiar Crimes impliedsome sort of fantastical element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then when I realized the books were firmly lodged in the real world, I leapt to the idea that Peculiar meant the sort of crimes they tackled or maybe the way they solved crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was getting closer but in reality I now feel it's the people in the PCU who are genuinely peculiar in the most delightful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John May is the more sober-minded of the pair and Arthur Bryant is the eccentric genius over-brimming with tidbits about London's history while liableShare This Book About The Author Christopher Fowler MoreChristopher Fowler is the acclaimed author of the award-winning Full Dark House and twelve other Peculiar Crimes Unit mysteries:The Water Room, Seventy-Seven Clocks, Ten Second Staircase, White Corridor, The Victoria Vanishes, Bryant &amp; May on theLoose, Bryant &amp; May off the …and Bryant &amp; May: Strange Tide, as well as the PCU story collection London’s Glory .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2015, Fowler won the coveted Crime Writers’ AssociationDagger in the Library Award in recognitionfor his body of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives in London,where he is at work on his next Peculiar Crimes Unit novel, Wild Chamber .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $27.00 (Hardcover) Published: December 13, 2016 Publisher: Bantam Pages: 448 ISBN 10: 1101887036 ISBN 13: 9781101887035to pull a min-easel out of one pocket and a blow torch out of the other from his voluminous, ancient coat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are a treat, as are the vivid other characters on their team, including oddballs like the two Daves (two blokes constantly doing mysterious repairs) and others who are fiercely loyal to the two dear old men, not least because they have a remarkable track record of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Christopher Fowler insists each novel can be read on its own but clearly long-time fans willenjoy this the most and newcomers will feel the pull of going back and starting at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In "Stranger Tides," Fowlercontinues the rather poignant sight of Bryant suffering increasing signs of dementia, which naturally isn't about to keep himfrom doing his job, even if he does occasionally seem to slip back in time to the earlier London of history that is his true love, only to "wake up" in the most embarrassing situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A city investigator is making life difficult, thanks to being simply agog and perhaps a little impressed at the sheer number of infractions and irregularities of the PCU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And theirhapless, long-suffering if harmless superior stands by looking daft, as always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a clever case involving immigrants whohave come to London on the down low and now find a talent for cons like televangelism and New Age rackets, dead bodiespiling up in the Thames and curious threads of knowledge Fowler weaves in here and there for buffs of arcana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all good fun, a solid entry in the series that shows every sign of continuing, a happy prospect since I had the mistaken impression their last tale was a swan song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now where's the TV series this practically begs for? -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Praise for Christopher Fowler’s ingenious novels featuring the Peculiar Crimes Unit “Fowler, like his crime-solvers, is deadpan, sly, and always unexpectedly inventive.” —Entertainment Weekly “An imaginative funhouse of a world where sage minds go to expand their vistas and sharpen their wits.” — Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times Book Review “[Fowler] takes delight in stuffing his books with esoteric facts; together with a cast of splendidly eccentriccharacters [and] corkscrew plots, wit, verve and some apposite social commentary, they make for unbeatablefun.” —The Guardian “Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fowler’s small but ardent American following deserves to get much larger.” —Janet Maslin, The New York Times “The most delightfully, wickedly entertaining duo in crime fiction.” —The Plain Dealer “Captivating.” —The Seattle Times “Dazzling.” —The Denver Post “Thrilling.” —Chicago Tribune What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
