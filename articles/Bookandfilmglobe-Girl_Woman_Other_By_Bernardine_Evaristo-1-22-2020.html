                <p>Friday, February 21, 2020 FICTION ‘Girl, Woman, Other’ A Symphony of Women’s Voices in Last Year’s Booker Prize Winner  January 22, 2020  Michael Giltz Scan all the lists naming the best works of 2019 and you’ll repeatedly see the title Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo , an acclaimed British writer new to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a treat, even though a brief description of this Booker Prize winner sounds noble and worthy in an “oh dear” sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evaristo offers a multiplicity of voices , all of them women of color living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some reviews suggest it’s an inspiring choir of female empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, but thankfully her novel is also witty, captivating, cleverly structured and fun.   Bernadine Evaristo, author photo by Jennie Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That structure reveals itself slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Chapter One, we hear from Amma, Yazz and Dominique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amma is a playwright with a new show opening at the National in London that very night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yazz is her daughter and Dominique is her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their stories diverge wildly and comment on one another in subtle and direct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Chapter Two, we hear from Carole, Bummi and LaTisha and they are a daughter, a mother and a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slowly we realize everyone has a link to one another and most of them will converge at the after party for Amma’s (hopefully) triumphant new play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I need to read more of Evaristo because her work is so confident and true here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know immediately you’re in good hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These characters constantly catch you off guard, or, rather, Evaristo does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carole is a high-powered player in the financial world, reaching higher and farther than her immigrant mother ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But her mom Bummi’s voice is so strong and infectious you can’t think of Carole any longer without thinking of her mother’s journey too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when Carole dismisses the chances of a classmate she leaves far behind, you’re ashamed to have agreed with her when LaTisha takes center stage and we discover her path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, Evaristo does this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A minor character, even a dislikable one, leaps from one section’s background to another section’s spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As in life, people surprise and confound and startle you until you just accept that you don’t really know anyone until you’ve worked hard to empathize and listen to their story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of this is done in free verse, here a style that permits Evaristo’s words to flow and fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She shoots high and skips across decades and then swoops down low to a particular moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The poetic line breaks put certain scenes into sharp relief, like the heartbreaking story of a rape and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the verse takes off again at light speed, pulling you along to meet person after person, from a 90-plus-year-old matriarch overseeing the family estate (and a terrible secret), to a schoolteacher who lives to give a leg up to worthy students but never receives her due, to a woman abandoned by a sailor in 1895, a sailor who promises to return but the only thing that arrives is a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes free verse slows you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here it’s rocket fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can’t recommend reading this as an e-book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the line breaks appear in their proper places, the visual display of the text will change depending on whether you’re on a phone or tablet or E-reader and yet again depending on the font and font size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A physical copy is paramount to know you’re reading it the way Evaristo intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it is a pleasure to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Girl, Woman, Other loses a little steam towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story of Megan, who became Morgan, is involving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But an extended section covering their online exploration of ideas like gender fluidity , transsexual, transgender and such was accurate but no more thrilling than reading any online chat room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, the play’s afterparty didn’t deliver quite the climax I expected, and while I found a final emotional epilogue intellectually satisfying, it didn’t knock me over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those are small reservations about this novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any section would make a satisfying story in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taken as a whole, it is indeed an inspiring choir of female empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet each voice receives the solo it richly deserves, and Evaristo orchestrates it all to bring clarity instead of cacophony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a beguiling melody whether you’re a girl, a woman, or other.
