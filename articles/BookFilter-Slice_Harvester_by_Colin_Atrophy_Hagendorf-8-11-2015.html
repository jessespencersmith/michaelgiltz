Some young punk -- literally, he loves punk; I'm not being dismissive or Cagney-esque --got a clever idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to every pizza by the slice joint in Manhattan and review them all, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He starts a blog.He launches a zine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He gets media attention because, like I said, it's a good idea and he wrote entertainingly about it.Good for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a book? For whatever reason I casually started it (I skim a lot of books these days, panning forgold) and suddenly I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, he writes amusingly about pizza, even pointing me to some joints I need tocheck out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this isn't a glorified collection of blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a full blown memoir about growing up a disgruntled,pain in the ass kid who found salvation and meaning in the subculture of punk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hagendorf (love the name!) ischarmingly self-deprecating about his childhood, perceptive and smart in depicting life as he saw it then with enoughdetached amusement to be charming without ever demeaning the oh so passionate viewpoint of his younger self.Then we see him out on his own delivering burritos and other...stuff, developing a serious drinking problem, being ina band (natch) and having a friend die by choking on his own vomit at far too young an age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within a year, Hagendorfhas decided to do SOMETHING with his life and it might as well be this cockamie pizza idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He launches the blog,starts to date a super terrific gal who's way too cool for him yet somehow sticks around even as his drinking getsworse (taking a job at a bar didn't help) and ultimately sobering up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus pizza! He works in all this along witheffective sketches of various pizza owners and the changing neighborhoods they are found in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's sweet, moving,breezy and quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And far more than an ode to pizza by the slice, but it's that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll bet he's got a novel in himsomewhere; presumably he'll write it in the booth of one of his favorite joints. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Hagendorf’s popular Slice Harvester blog chronicled his quest to eat and review a slice of cheese pizza from everypizzeria in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this entertaining memoir, he mashes up that journey with the topics of addiction, family,punk rock, nostalgia, and love. … Full of drinking binges, colorful characters from the punk scene, and randomasides, like comparing a slice to Anthony Kiedis, the narrative takes readers on a roller-coaster ride.” - PublishersWeekly“It speaks to me man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s about New York and pizza and getting your shit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s what I’m about and whatI’m trying to be about.” - Himanshu Suri, rapperWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
