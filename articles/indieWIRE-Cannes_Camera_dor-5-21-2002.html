Who knows? It could hapPen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two American candidates are Peter SolleU's debut "Long WillY Home" and DreamWolks ' "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron ." Spirit was roundly ignored by one and all as no Shrek (last yeats surprise triumph of the fest).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the press screening at the grand Lumiere was one of the least­ attended events so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Solieit's drama was a last minute delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This New Yolk City-based stoty about a 17 year old would-be Romeo has marvelous performances from its young cast and especially the always despaifiog Mommy. an elderly Dominican grandmothef who can't handle the pressures of modem life when thai means one of her grandsons misses mass and the other one is masturbatin9 in the bathroom , (She eyes the boy's off-camera erection with a withering stare and then says. "Oh, the shame." He's going to need a lot of therapy.) It has the revelatory feel of George Washington . but with a much more audience-pleasing storyline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a natural for the New Yolk F~m Festival Of" at least New DirectorslNew Films and it's just been picked up by Samuel Goidwyn and Fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cineastes -who WOfry whenever a film is too entertaining -have thrown their support behind "J.apon" (Japan), a Mexico-Spain co-productioo directed by Cartos Reygadills .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 129 minutes, it's one of the longer films at a festival notable for hup:llwww.indicwirc.com/filmifesti. ·alslfo:s_02Cannes _020521Camcrn.html Pal:C I of 4 (JUiiifWIlI ) ~"';,O ......... . , .... , •• ... ....

(He also risks the wrath of the ASPCA, since the shot of a pigeon's tom head that is still breathing is either a great special effect or. more likely, gives the lie to the claim that no animals were narmed during the making of the film.) He also shoots one of the most quietly awkward,least sexy sex scenes imaginable. "Japan" is "awed but ambitious and achieves enough 10 let cineastes feel Reygadas has more to offer. 11'15 the favorite of !hose few disturbed by "City of God"'s glossy sheen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More ambitious -at least structurally -and much leu successful is "Camag ..

"CaRWIge " never reached emotional depth and once viewers figure out what all these different strands have in convnon lhefe's little more to be gained. "Madame Sala" prefers to take its chances on real melodrama .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Bra:r.ilian film, this one set in the '305, it tells the story of one oftha legends of Carnival.
