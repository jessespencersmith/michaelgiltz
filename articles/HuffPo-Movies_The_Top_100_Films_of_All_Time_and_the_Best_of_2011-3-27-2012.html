                <p>Entertainment Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Read more Best Movies , Best Movies 2011 , Top 100 Movies , Top Movies , Entertainment NewsReact Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyMovies: The Top 100 Films of All Time and the Best of 2011 The IRA Film Awards are the most prestigious, mysterious and exclusive movie awards in the world.Long after the frenzy of "awards season" has passed, themembers of the IRAs meet to soberly discuss, debate,argue, bicker, fight, and mock each other as they decidewhat truly are the best films, performances andtechnical achievements of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They alsoshine a light on some of the worst achievements in cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs were founded in the 1970s with one very simple thought: we've got better taste than those other award shows; let's do our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And thus the IRAs were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its ranks have contained future Oscarwinners, acclaimed and best-selling authors of both fiction and nonfiction (especially movie history),power players in the studio system, influential members of the media, hardcore cineastes and the teambehind Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards, the most acclaimed (really, theONLY acclaimed) awards book in history and the template for all the ones that followed in its wake.Usually composed of 10-20 members, the IRAs spend their year watching and debating the movies thatreally matter, the ones they hope will last and then share their judgment with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year the IRAs voted on both the best films of 2011 and the best films of all time, a laborious and fun process that involved catching up with classic movies, debating and arguing them and multiple rounds ofvoting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result? A list none of us are truly happy with, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bemoan the lack of animated films and just one documentary that made the cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others are embarrassed by the omission of Bollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a good list: watch all 100 films and you will have a good grounding in some classic cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It happened for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I somehow had never caught director Max Ophuls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now The Earrings Of Madame De... is high on my personal list of the best movies of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same with the ground-breaking, revelatory Jeanne Dielman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So debate and mock the list, but do watch the movies you've never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy! And tell me, how many of the movies on this list of 100 have you seen? (I had to see 20 of them for thefirst time before the final vote and I see a lot of movies!)

"Young Tom Edison" with Mickey Rooney is a delight too and so is Rooney. 05:18 PM on 03/28/2012 Since the anniversary of the sinking is upon us, the best film and a terrific one about the Titanicwas the British version, "A Night To Remember".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Done in stark black and white, it's brilliantlyeffective with fine performances all around. 09:32 PM on 03/28/2012 Oh, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just come out in a new edition on Criterion which I'll be reviewing this weekor next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Night To Remember is a very fine drama and certainly the best film based onTitanic.Recency | Popularity Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 total) HUFFPOST SUPER USER Steamboater Forget hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Steamboater Forget hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writerComments 63 Pending Comments 0 View FAQ Comments are closed for this entry View All Favorites Bloggers 3106 Fans 3106 Fans 127 Fans11:12 PM on 03/28/2012 I want to get it but it's pricey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll wait until Amazon has it for less later on. 05:13 PM on 03/28/2012 Anything directed by David Lean should be at the top of anyone's list. 09:33 PM on 03/28/2012 Marvelous director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have Lawrence Of Arabia and Great Expectations on my short list and this week I'm reviewing his collaborations with David Lean. (I've never seen In Which WeServe and am looking forward to it.) Have you ever seen Hobson's Choice? Another delightful Lean film (one of his best) and yet it slips through the cracks even for fans. 10:46 PM on 03/28/2012 Seen "Hobson's Choice". "A Passage To India" was wonderful too, even if Lean did Alec Guinness a favor and casted him in a role he was unsuited for, just asLean cast Gunness as Zhivago's brother. he was too old for the part and miscast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judy Davis made it well worthwhile though. "Doctor Zhivago" is really a film a I watch over and over. i saw it on my new TV set which is LED instead of the plasma I had and you really get a different perspective on films with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That glossy film aspect isn't there so it looks as if you're seeingit live in some scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lean really had to edit that one down because in the bookYuri Zhivago is involved with three women, not two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the book, he becomes astreet person, lost in the chaos of Russia and is picked up by a woman who he has an affair with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lean cut that out because he believed American audiences wouldn't believe a man could be involved with three women when married to oneand having an affair with another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with all Lean films, the cinematography is justsuperb. 02:05 PM on 03/28/2012 Instead of listing movies that should be here, I'm just going to whine about the ones that are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rulesof the Game?

And how about sharing your full list of the 100 best movies of all time? 12:56 PM on 03/28/2012 I saw "The Tree of Life" and it deserves every award it received above including, if not especially cinematography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the kind of film Stanley Kubrick would have made if he were still alive and on top of his game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, that's the highest compliment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But attempting to decide the top 100 films of all time are amongst thousands over the course of a century is a fools errand that will always end up being completely subjective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simply glancing through the above list points this out as the titles near the top seem to be olderfilms and yet as a new art form cinema is still advancing/evolving to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many people romanticize older films but pre 1960 movies are often technically and artistically inferior to more recent ones. 02:07 PM on 03/28/2012 clearly never seen Kane! 02:35 PM on 03/28/2012 Many times but alas never till the end because I always fall asleep first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All 11:22 PM on 03/28/2012 Technically and artisitcally inferior to modern film? Hardly so, unless you love those CGI FX which often look like CGI FX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take a highly popular classic like "The Charge of the LightBrigade" with Errol Flynn. if anything, the charge at the end is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was shot so well that you're riveted to the screen and can almost hear the raging thunder of horse hoofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flynn actually rode that horse too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studios then put out more intelligent scripts then weget today too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They catered to a a more mature audience, unlike today where the studioscater predominately to a teen crowd. 07:40 AM on 03/29/2012 Simply by the fact that film was still in it's infancy as an art form even into the1940's and 50's means the aesthetic was completely different than more moderncinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acting and dialogue of those older films seems stiff and stilted bytoday's standard so even a beautifully shot film by Greg Toland like "The Grapes of Wrath" seems inhabited by cartoonish characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comparing films pre and post 1960 (just to pick one cutoff point) is like comparingapples to oranges, it just doesn't work.Also your comparing the top 5% of films made in the "studio era" to ALL filmsmade now is not fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course classic films seem better now as we only reviewthe cream of the crop, not the hundreds of dreck pics (or "b" pictures) churned out by the studios.Permalink | Share it FirstGame72 The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters Permalink | Share it NHBill Permalink | Share it FirstGame72 The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Steamboater Forget hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it FirstGame72 The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters563 Fans 673 Fans 563 Fans 3106 Fans 563 FansThere are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All 12:51 PM on 03/28/2012 Thanks for commenting everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd be the first person to start naming all the movies that are NOT o the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's half the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not one of you named how many of the movies on the list you hadseen or more to the point how many movies you hadn't seen! I had to watch 20 of the movies oncethey made it onto the final list and saw a lot of great films I'd never seen before, like Dreyer's Ordetand Day Of Wrath and Chantal Ackerman's Jeanne Dielman and the terrifically entertaining noir OutOf The Past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope instead of falling back on your old favorites like we all do, that you'll use the listto explore some great films you've never seen before., If you do, you might just discover that some of them make it onto your all time best list as well. 12:41 PM on 03/28/2012 West Side Story is a superior musical and film to Meet Me In St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never heard of the IRA awards...seems like it's one guy with a blog?? 03:55 PM on 03/28/2012 West Side Story is a great musical though the IRA voters are not keen on Robert Wise ingeneral. they're auteurists through and through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a very casual collective that began inthe 1970s among Columbia film buffs, as I detailed in my intro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no formal group a la NYFC or an established poll a la Sight &amp; Sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's no more or less "real" than you and your friends doing the same thing every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they've been doing it for decades (Ijoined in 1991) and their ranks have produced people with the accomplishments I'vementioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can go to the link above and check out their awards over the years, someof which I vehemently object to (but they've gotten better since I joined :). 07:47 PM on 03/28/2012 To me it's a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The staging of the dance scenes is so fantastic and theset design and art direction, perfect to me, particularly the colour palette theychose with the purples, reds and mustard yellows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music I LOVE and other than casting Natalie Wood (who was great, but the pitch of her voice was too different from Marnie Nixon's who sang for the role of Maria), I thought the castwas amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rita Moreno and George Chakiris were wonderful!! Robert Wise wasonly a co-director, Jerome Robbins is credited as directing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like Meet Mein St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Louis, it's a sweet film...but top 100?

Otherwise, a perfect list. 03:56 PM on 03/28/2012 Def on the short list of greatest film titles of all time. 09:43 AM on 03/28/2012 I understand lists such as these always make for some fun debates and the criteria can vary wildlyat times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not every movie aficionado is going to be happy with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there are some damngreat movies here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But seriously, not one Coppola movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man is responsible for three of the greatest movies of all time (The Godfather I &amp; II, The Conversation) and possibly a fourth (Apocalypse Now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lang's Metropolis is obvious but no M?

"Written On The Wind" was pure low rent Hollywood melodrama. "Travels With My Aunt" didn't live up to the book and Maggie Smith wasmiscast; Rosiland Russell should have played the part, and "Advise and Consent" doesn't even holdup today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gore Vidal's "The Best Man" is much better. 12:32 PM on 03/28/2012 I agree completely on all counts, especially Travels With My Aunt, which is one of the fewmovies on the list I wouldn't even put on a best of the year list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I much prefer Anatomy Of A Murder to Advise &amp; Consent in the Preminger canon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm seeing The Best Man on Broadway Friday night and looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Douglas Sirk, he is unquestionably a technical master; his movies are brilliantly shot and edited, with every single element(other than the acting) masterful and on a par with the greats like HItchcock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thatpersonally can't elevate the movies past the bad acting endemic to many of them or the silly plot twists (the funeral for a housekeeper in Imitation Of Life is as grand as a state funeral, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his stock has risen a great deal over the years and many othercritics groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His three biggies -- Written On The Wind, All That Heaven Allows andImitation Of Life -- all received votes in the Sight &amp; Sound poll of critics all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the IRAs are not alone on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I agree with you. 02:12 PM on 03/28/2012 So true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just re-watched "Advise and Consent" last week and was amused by it's naivety and lessthe good acting. 09:41 PM on 03/28/2012 Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still a good "process" movie for showing how Washington "really" worksand interesting for showing that the politicians were less concerned with details likea member being closeted than the fact that someone had broken the boys club rules they abide by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not a patch on Anatomy. 08:30 AM on 03/28/2012 The Lana Turner/John Garfield version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" should have been on that list of 100.Others: "To Kill A Mockingbird" "I Want To Live""Farewell, My Concubine" (Dickensian in scope)"The Good Earth""Death In Venice""Georgy Girl""Harold Pinter's 'The Servant" "A Man For All Seasons" "The Hunchback of Notre Dame " (Charles Laughton)""The Girl With The Green Eyes" (Rita Tushingham)"The Fixer" (Alan Bates)"Zorba The Greek" "The Letter" (Bette Davis) "The Strange One" (Ben Gazarra)Steamboater Forget hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it NHBill Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz freelance writer Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Steamboater Forget hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agitate.3106 Fans 127 Fans 673 Fans 127 Fans 3106 Fans "Drums Along The Mohawk" (Claudette Colbert/Henry Fonda) ""Lawrence of Arabia" "Gilda" "Separate Tables"' "Shampoo" SO many others.... 09:43 PM on 03/28/2012 Some great movies, many of them on my personal list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More to the point, there are four I've never seen, including The Servant, The Fixer (clearly you're a Bogarde fan), The Strange One and Girl With Green Eyes (which I've never even heard of!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I look forward to checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many films on the IRA list do you need to check out?

"The Girl With The Green Eyes" also stars Lynn Redgrave., and 'The Strange One" ws a breakout point for Ben Gazarra in film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's just keeps you on edgethroughout the entire film, about a military academy where Gazarra plays a bully toperfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Made in the 50's. 06:07 PM on 03/27/2012 Lots of Howard Hawks-very good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not noting which of three versions of 'A Star is Born' made thelist-not so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And unless I missed it-no Chaplin?

IRA oddly, stands for Ira, the name of one of the members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never received a straight answer as to how it came to be dubbed that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also had an ever- changing series of names for the group, like the New York Independent Film Circle, the New York Circle Of Very Independent Film Goers and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Chaplin, it has twosources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One, Buster Keaton has enjoyed all the revival status in the past few years, so hismovies have been showcased better in theaters (always the best place to see a film) and therefore fresher in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second, I think slowly critics have come around to the idea -- which I support -- that Chaplin's best work can be found in his shorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keaton always had the advantage that almost all attention once focused on The General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's spreading out to Sherlock Jr. and (in my opinion) The Cameraman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the same lack of focus thatChaplin had where some love Gold Rush, others Modern Times, still others The GreatDictator and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps to have one great classic like The Night Of The Hunter rather than four or five great films because then no one agrees on them and suddenly Coppola is off the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advertise | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | About Our Ads | Contact Us Copyright © 2012 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of AOL-HuffPost EntertainmentPermalink | Share it Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 total)</p>
