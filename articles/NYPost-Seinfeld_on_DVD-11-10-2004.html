                <p>"Seinfeld" repeals are everywhere but fans want those bloopers -and, yeah, the salt shakers. '[ Y/~ it.:"t' e f DVD domain 'Seinfeld' set poised to break record By MICHAEL GILTZ 'SEINFELD" seems ready to set new re­ cords for the best­ selling TV show on DVD when it hits stores later this month. "It could be the biggest seller of all time," says Scott Hettrick, the editor in chief of industry trade paper "DVD Exclusive." Hettrick says you should bet on Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer when they hit stores on Nov. 23 with the extras-packed DVD in three different sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One volume includes seasons one and two; an­ other volume includes sea­ son three; and a boxed set includes salt and pepper shakers, playing cards and a copy of a script with notes by co-creator Larry David for $119.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With two weeks still to go before their release, Amazon com already lists the three packages at No. 26, No. 11 and -for the priciest combo set -No. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best-selling TV show on DVD is "Chap-pelle's Show: Season One Uncensored" at 2 million units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That passed by "The Simpsons" 0.9 million units for its season one) and "Family Guy" (1.6 million units).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the record, those numbers pale next to the­ atrical titles like "Shrek 2," which just sold 12.1 million units its first weekend, grossing $185 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But TV shows are often much pricier. "I've been starting to hear some questions lately," admits Hettrick, about the chances of "Seinfeld'; to set records. "The way it's packaged, the way it's priced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a huge demand for it; it will certainly be one of the biggest ever, if not the biggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there ha';~ ' been so many surprises in the TV genre. 'Friends' was on NBC and is one of the highest rated shows ever and it didn't sell as well as 'Chappelle.' " But "Seinfeld" has been off NBC for six years, so fans haven't been deluged with the show the way "Friends" was omnipresent when it first hit DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, it's still a major presence in reruns, reminding casual viewers how funny the show is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the big batch of ex­ tras make the DVD sets seem more than just a re­ packaging of what people can see for free on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So maybe it won't reach blockbuster numbers akin to hit movies -not that there's anything wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At $1l9.95 each, if the boxed set can sell just 1.5 million units, it alone will equal "Shrek 2's" first weekend sales in dollars -and that's what really matters in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dave Chappelle's show has been a game-changer for Comedy Central, which re-upped him for two more seasons with a contract that could be worth up to $50 million and includes a hefty piece of the DVD action. "Family Guy" is coming back from the dead with all new episodes at least in part because Fox wants to have more DVD sets to sell.</p>
