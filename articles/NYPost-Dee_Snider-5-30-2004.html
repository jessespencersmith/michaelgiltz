You'll find out as VHl delves into some of the most outra­ geous, shocking, and hilarious antics of the genre's notorious artists on Monday's "100 Most Metal Moments." The cable channel chose the perfect narrator for this freak-out show: Dee Snider of Twisted Sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Snider main­ tained his sanity and stayed away from chemically altering his perspective -he's one of the few people left from that era who can actually remember what really happened. "Being clean and sober and healthy and intelligent in the '80s, I was essentially an alien," laughs Snider, taking a break from recording "House of Hair," his nationally syndicated radio show heard on 165 sta­ tions that celebrates metal. "I've been married to the same woman for 28 years! Now they're all coming [over] to my side and cleaning up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm thinking of doing smack because I want to be an individual," Snider jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meatloaf taunting a crowd into throwing mountains of refuse; Motley Crue getting girls to squat in kitty litter boxes -the 49- year-old Long Island native saw it all. "My favorite was the face-off between Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue," Snider says of Metal Moment No.7. "They were trying to one-up each other and Ozzy end­ ed up snorting a line of red ants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the Motleys, I can't remember which one, peed on the floor and then Ozzy got on all fours and licked it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can't beat Ozzy." Metal moment No.5: "This is Spinal Tap." Snider's own key metal moment may have come when he testified in front of Congress and proved himself a passionate and intelligent defender of free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he breeds dogs and rereads the sweet­ ly nostalgic work ofJean Shepherd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Snider's also working on a sequel to his cult film, "Strangeland" (the most stolen video in America, he claims), and doing occasional gigs with Twisted Sister, clad in full mid­ '80s regalia. "The bad news is we look like a bunch of aging drag queens," Snider says. "The good news is we always looked like a bunch of aging drag queens." -Michael Giltz 100 MOST METAL MOMENTS Monday, 10 p.m., VHl</p>
