(Some of his letters are quite brief.) On the other hand, I'm not surprised in the least that Proust is a difficult neighbor, apologizing ever so profusely while he complains for the thousandth time about the noiseof a neighbor's servants or workmen or countless other indignities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Could not perhaps the neighbor's servants ascertain whenProust's servants plan to beat their rugs outdoors and time it so all are beaten at once? And the ever-ailing Proust wondersif perhaps they could ask the workmen to do nothing on Friday because Proust is daring to venture outdoors that evening and it will take an entire day of tomb-like silence for the great man to even consider the hazards of a dinner engagement without faltering at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, it's all quite amusing and his letters entertain, especially in the nimble translation byLydia Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe if we read the responses of his neighbor this very brief work might feel a bit more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as is,it's a minor amusement that cannot bear the scrutiny of standing on its own. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Proust whining rhapsodically about the sounds of frolicking children on the other side of his bedroom wall, as translated by Lydia Davis — what’s not to love here? - Evan Lavender-Smith HTMLGiant Everything great in the world comes from neurotics. - Marcel Proust Literary people know that at the sentence level and the word level Lydia Davis is the best there is. - Michael Silverblatt Bookworm A sensitive and direct translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lydia Davis does us a great service in bringing back Proust. - Claire Messud Newsday What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
