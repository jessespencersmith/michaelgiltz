"TheArtist" Debuts Okay, one more day until Malick's The Tree Of Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should this really be seen as the only hope for the fest?I've already seen several movies that were good to verygood and some fare from Sundance that proved worthyof their praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The one thing no one expected was alight, frothy ode to classic Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can Cannes evenhandle a comedy? The last one to win the Palme d'Orwas maybe the darkly black Coen Brothers movieBarton Fink or before that Robert Altman's MASH all the way back in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So let's just assume that thevery warm applause The Artist received was due more to relief after a string of grim movies and not a sign ofthings to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ARTIST *** 1/2 out of **** Not since Bob Clark made up for his Porky's movies with A Christmas Story have we seen a director make such a leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Michel Hazanavicius is best known in France for the 077 spy comedies (more akin to Matt Helm than Austin Powers in style).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out of nowhere he's delivered an essentially silent filmcomplete with intertitles that is a delightful ode to classic Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot in black and white and hitting MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 New Photos Emerge In Anthony Weiner Twitter Scandal Anthony Weiner Admits Sending Racy Pictures, Refuses To Resign FOLLOW US PHOTOS: Who Won Big At This Year's 'Fashion Oscars'?Michelle Obama Wears Naeem Khan To State Dinner Nancy Pelosi Wears Vintage Thierry Mugler To 7 Sites You Should Be Wasting Time On Right NowBIG NEWS: Movies Celebrity Body The Kardashians Katy Perry Microsoft More Log in | Sign Up News Web PHOTO: Pink Debuts Post-Baby Body More In Entertainment: DiCaprio Going Bad?...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The two leads are completely unknown to me, but winning and dead-on when it comes to capturing the style of silent film acting and broad but appealing manner of Hollywood flicks from the 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's 1927 and Jean Dujardin is George Valentin, thebiggest star around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berenice Bejo is Peppy, the ardent fan swept out of anonymity and into overnight success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She can handle the wrenching change to sound movies but George is set adrift, pouring his heart and soul into a directing effort that is the pinnacle of silent film success but hopelessly out of date as far as audiences are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock market crash doesn't help in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her star rises, his falls and she can't even help him out without hurting his feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, this is essentially a silent film, not counting a clever nightmare sequence where sound overwhelms George at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tone is playful but romantic as well and the two leads have chemistry andcharm to burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're surrounded by excellent support, including John Goodman as a softie of a studiotycoon and James Cromwell as a chauffeur first for George and then for Peppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The score (which at onekey moment uses Bernard Herrmann) is marvelous and the scenes of Hollywood filmmaking almost asmuch fun as the scenes of stars being stars on and off the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sounded like a lame spin on Singin' InThe Rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It turns out to be a true delight that movie buffs should embrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only thing pedestrian about the film is its title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe like Clark's A Christmas Story, this will remain Hazanavicius's only notable legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he'll go on to deliver more original and worthwhile fare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for one moment atleast, Hazanavicius has proven he's an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TAKE SHELTER *** out of **** Shotgun Stories was one of my favorite films of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take Shelter may not make my final list in 2011 (though I certainly want to see it again), but it unquestionably proves that writer-director Jeff Nichols is the real deal and that actor Michael Shannon is his De Niro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take Shelter is about a man who works in construction and is happily married with a wife and a young daughter who is deaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quiet, stable man, he(Shannon) is suddenly plagued with horrifying nightmares in which his dog attacks him, people try and grab his daughter or -- again and again -- a storm of terrifying proportions is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These panic attacks get worse and worse but our hero won't confide in his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's worried that this is a sign of mentalillness, the same thing that drove his mother into a home in her mid-30s and scarred his childhoodpermanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He both reaches out to a therapist and risks his financial situation by expanding theirbackyard storm shelter, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the visions or nightmares get worse and worse, he becomes moreand more unhinged, desperate to find out whether he's losing his mind or getting a sign of theapocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a bold tale that reminded me somewhat of the otherwise dissimilar movie The Rapture.It's quiet and understated, even as it shows a man unraveling or receiving the sort of prophetic signs thatused to be more commonplace in our preindustrial world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's intelligent, engaging filmmaking andthough it's taken four years for Nichols to follow his excellent debut, I'm already eager to see his nextwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Nichols talking about his movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

(The Marlene, by the way, is the name the women in the cult must use when answering the telephone.) Truth be told, the flashbacks to the cult are far more interesting than the present scenes of Martha's awkward inability to relate to her sister or her sister's husband (Hugh Dancy, nicely prickly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thesense of unease she feels -- greatly enhanced by a marvelously creepy and unusual score by Daniel Bensiand Saunder Juriaans -- keeps us on edge wondering if Martha will collapse mentally or just as likely betracked down by the cult that is only a few hours away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a mature, striking and ultimately hauntingmovie that allows you to understand how someone can get trapped into such a bizarre and unlikelyworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All it takes is pain and vulnerability and the bad luck to run into someone who will take advantageof it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; L'APOLLONIDE/HOUSE OF TOLERANCE * 1/2 out of **** TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Laurence Fishburne Leaving CSI Jennifer Connelly GivesWater Birth Kim Kardashian's WeddingSlim Down MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.comNicolas Cage's SonHospitalized After Fight Will Justin and Mila's Fauxmance Have Benefits Jennifer Love Hewitt: Worst Actress In Hollywood?
