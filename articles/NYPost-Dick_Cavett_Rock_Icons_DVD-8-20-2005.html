                <p>When oc W 5 OU Cavett DVD captures legends By MICHAEL GILTZ TALK show legend Dick Cavett can't play an instrument, can't really sing and never really lisÂ­ tens to rock 'n' roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But rock stars loved him. "Dick' Cavett: Rock Icons" (Shout; $39.98) is the fust in a seÂ­ ries of DVD boxed sets that presÂ­ ents complete, uncut episodes of Cavett's E..mmy-winning talk show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's filled with performances and interviews with rockers like JefferÂ­ son Airplane (just back from Woodstock), Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, George Harrison, the Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin and others. "I don't know why they all agr~.e;dj:Q. ,come "()Ii my show," says " Cavett, who once hit the cover of Time but admits he was so clueÂ­ less about the rock lifestyle (ie. drugs) that his staff had to expl.ain what the paraphernalia the rockers left behind was used for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One hilarious interview finds a nervous and very fey David Bowie stroking a cane and sniffing very loudly throughout his interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cavett insists he was naive about the goings-on behind the scenes of these shows, which were taped in a Brojldway house iri the early '70s just around the corner from the Ed Sullivan Theatre (where David Letterman's "Late Show" is taped today). "Does sniffing indicate coke? I'm so innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could never really tell," says Cavett. "I knew someÂ­ thing was operating besides themÂ­ selves, but I never knew quite what it was or how to spot the variety of available drugs. . .. " .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But tellingly, what Cavett re~ members most about Bowie was an unexpected and poignant response to a question about his mother (BoÂ­ wie's father had already died). "I think she has a day job," said Bowie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how does she explain her son to friends? "I think she preÂ­ tends I'm not hers," he says. tfter laughing a bit nervously, Bowie adds, "We were neVer that close, particularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have an underÂ­ standing." Coming next month is a set de-Old TV pearl: Janis Joplin with her favorite interviewer, Dick Cavett. voted to frequent guest Ray Charles and, in November, one deÂ­ voted to John Lennon and Yoko Ono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sly Stone mumbled mo.&amp;.t of his answeI'S" ~di1ririg their chat,kept saying "I like you," to Cavett and got bored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grace Slick tried to remain above it all by calling Cavett "Jim." (He responds mock angrily, "You've got to learn my name, Miss Joplin!" Everyone laughs: Cavett never pretended to be hip, but he wasn't a pushover either.) But one disc in this first set is deÂ­ voted to perhaps Cavett's most imÂ­ portant and memorable musical guest of all: Janis Joplin, who loved doing the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no wonder: Cavett brought out the sweet, funny and delightful person she truly was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether she's extolling the virÂ­ tues of F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Fitzgerald or engÂ­ aging in a surreal battle of wits with Raquel Welch, Joplin shined with Cavett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On one show, Cavett jokes that he's up on all the latest lingo. "Yeah," says Joplin. "I can tell you're a real swinger by the shoes you're wearing." Cavett barely drank but Joplin once got him stoned on a joint big enough to impress Cheech &amp; Chong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cavett returned the favor by taking Joplin out to a fancy New York restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cavett rni.sses Joplin still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching ' episode after episode of Cavett -filled with fascinating guests, witty and informed converÂ­ sation and terrific music -you reÂ­ alize we miss Cavett, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VI ~ .., 0. ~ Â» c: 1.0 ~ N 9 N C) C) U'I ::s '&lt; '0 o ~ (') o 3</p>
