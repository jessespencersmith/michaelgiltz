So how come my niecesand nephews checked not once but twice to makesure they were DVRing Idol for me (I'm on theroad this week) and yet STILL failed to catch theshow? Then I called my friend Aaron just oneminute AFTER he erased the show on his DVR soI couldn't slingbox it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didn't find video illegallyposted last night on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This morning I getall legal and go to iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this morning, only TWO videos were available for sale: of all people, Megan Joy and Scott, two of the mostpanned performances of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they're all up, but really -- $1.50 for each and every video(and no judges critique)? How about $2 for the entire show, just like 24 and Secret Life and every other TV show on TV? $15 just for the performance videos from the Top 10? But do I need to actually watch the show in order to know who is going home? Ken Levine praised Adam Lambert -- who reportedly finally gave a restrained performance -- and said Michael Sarver would get the boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entertainment Weekly 's Michael Slezak also panned Michael Sarver, Scott MacIntyre and Megan Joy (the consensus worst-three of the night, clearly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He thinks Sarver's cranky attitude will get him the boot and had a shout out for Kris Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vote For The Worst has its heart set on keeping Megan Joy going: they think she's the worst and so they urge you to vote for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dial Idol -- which ranks contestants based on how many busy signals they get when dialing in -- also says the bottom three is Scott, Megan Joy and Michael Sarver, with Sarver at the very bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My friend Aaron grumbles every week that he's sick of the show and doesn't like anyone but always has a detailed critique and is afraid his favorite -- based on, ahem, her talents -- will be sentpacking.

It sounds like Scott had a good post-performance chat with the judges making fun of his pink pants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So sight unseen, I'd say the bottom three is Megan Joy and Scott MacIntyre and Michael Sarver with Sarver going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Joy makes it another week thanks to being cute, one of the few remaining women, the support of Vote For The Worst and the fact that she's funny and a goof while Sarver was defensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now I've found illegal postings online (no, I am NOT going to spend $15 to watch the performance videos; Idol REALLY needs to post the entire show for $2) so let's see if the onlineappraisals gibe with what I see now. (I skipped Smokey's sessions for time reasons.) MATT GIRAUD -- Sings "Let's Get It On." With a killer falsetto, Matt delivers an excellent performance of the song, just nailing it in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All four judges praise him with Randy and Simon -- who were just on Jay Leno announcing the final three would be Lil Rounds AdamLambert and Danny Gokey -- admitting that Matt was vying for the finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara -- and really, I'mjut jealous that I'm not the fourth judge instead of her -- bizarrely said Matt should have doneMORE riffing and straying away from the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She must really love Mariah Carey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula slaps herdown subtly by praising the fact that Matt respected the melody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula's right; something I've beensaying all season and more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KRIS ALLEN -- Sings "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)." Another smashing performance by someone who hasn't come close to peaking yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kris owned the stage, was flawless on vocals, gave a good spin to the James Taylor arrangement and to my mind was just terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also lookedgreat, of course, though I'm worried the stubble could become too studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I saw him performingon the Grammys or at the Beacon in NYC, that performance would prove he belongs there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And ofcourse he's the most Tiger Beat-ish of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know if he'll win and I don't know if hehas any originals in him, but I'd sign him right now as being the most obviously commercial of theTop 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bizarrely, Kara insisted Kris DIDN'T do James Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, he gave the song an originalspin but he was clearly doing the James Taylor arrangment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, all four judges praised him with Simon calling for more swagger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The others insist conceit has nothing to do with it, but there are very few (if no) superstars in music (or movies or theater or TV) who aren't bursting with self- regard and an unshakable belief in their own fabulousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCOTT MACINTYRE -- Sings "You Can't Hurry Love." I've felt Scott was out of his league throughout the Top 36 and nothing he did tonight has changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The quiet intro was actually not bad but then the song speeded up -- and thank goodness for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The backup singersarrayed around the piano a la the Rae-lettes of Ray Charles -- and the upbeat melody masked veryweak vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott actually came across better than he has in a while -- at least his vocal limitationswere masked -- but he still wasn't any good, running out of breath repeatedly, flat at times and soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The male judges were very negative, and the women were only polite at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara -- who aminute ago insisted Matt should take more vocal liberties -- now chided Scott for taking any at all.She also got ghetto again, saying "Gimme some rhythm, Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yo, I like that" which I foundunbearable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula had the best moment of the night by surprising Simon with crayons and coloringbook when she felt he was misbehaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He laughed so much you know it was a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEGAN JOY -- Sang "For Once In My Life." She looked adorable and sang with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Joy was never going to go all the way, but actually for the first time in a while I felt Megan at least lived up to her own potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was shouty at times and couldn't hit the high notes, but it had aton of personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, it wasn't actually good but I can see how in the studio she could hit aMadeleine Peyroux sort of vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the judges were negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Kara again got ghetto by saying,"Tell 'er to come back because we lookin' for her." What is up with that? Unlike what I've heardabout Michael Sarver, she handled their comments politely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon's comment about how sheshould fire whomever is advising her was a rare admittance of all the serious backstage teamsbehind these people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANOOP DESAI - Sang "Ooh, Baby, Baby." Technically very proficient and certainly good enough to get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sometimes you feel someone is singing for the audience (or for the song) and people like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Touching the Queenwasn't the only...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; April Fools 2009!

SPOILER: 'American Idol' Boots Anothersometimes they're singing for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Anoop looked into the camera I didn't feel like he was looking at us; I thought he was looking in a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Totally unfair and subjective, but there you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the judges liked it though Simon thought it was a bit boring on the showmanship side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL SARVER -- Sang "Ain't To Proud To Beg." Like Scott and Megan Joy, Michael is one of the people who makes the Top 10 and then has people wondering how they got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But also like Megan Joy and Scott, I thought Michael lived up to his potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not that good of a singer, so exactly how good do they expect him to be? I thought he did a credible job giving his skills on the tune, working the crowd, having fun and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not trying to pay a backhanded compliment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of falling flat on his face, Michael did the best he could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did drop the ball with the comments by saying he could "turn it around and SANG." Uh, shouldn't you be doing that all the time? And why did he know when he walked out on stage that it would be subpar? As good as it gets for him, but not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIL ROUNDS -- Sang "Heatwave" and had the perfect look for Motown week -- not dress-up retro but a great nod to the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was fine, but this is a classic example of a great single but not a great song to cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There just isn't that much you can do with this tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Slezak of EW interestingly points out how this tune has been a curse in past seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges were mostly negative except for Paula, who praised her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they gave Lil so many props she should be back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADAM LAMBERT -- In the past, I've felt that Adam was "playing" a rock star on stage, as if he were in another musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tonight, when he seemed to be wearing more of a costume than ever with the Elvis hair and cleaned-up look, ironically I thought Adam actually was just singing the song.Almost everyone has been calling for him to tone down the theatrics (they don't belong on everysong and certainly not on Johnny Cash's "Ring Of Fire") and he delivered with a simple,straightforward "Tracks Of My Tears" with an acoustic backing and some killer falsetto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don'tthink he's pulling away, thanks to steadily improving Matt, Kris and (hopefully, I haven't watchedher yet -- Allison), not to mention Lil and Danny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But finally, I can join Adam's fans and genuinelyapplaud his performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now next week do Meatloaf and wig out as much as you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DANNY GOKEY -- Sang "Get Ready." It's never a good idea to ignore direct advice from a guest artist, especially when you say on video that you will listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, Danny gave certain lines to the backup singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not that anyone seemed to notice or care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny was fine, butI wrote "peaked?" while he was singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, he is solid and dependable like Paula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it feltfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good, not great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the judges agreed, except for Simon who came down hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not a lockfor the finals anymore, by a long stretch, especially since he seems too similar to recent winnerTaylor Hicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALLISON IRAHETA -- Sang "(Papa Was A) Rolling Stone." Most everyone is talking about Adam Lambert online, and all props to him for delivering on his promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Matt Giraud was very strong, Kris looked like a pro, Danny and Lil are ready to bounce back and then there's Allison.Maybe the judges were rushed, but they weren't strong enough in their praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You only mentionsomeone's age when their skills are limited. "She can run really fast...for a 63 year old." "He's verygood at math...for a five year old." Allison is not a good singer...for a 16 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a goodsinger, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Make that a great singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was tremendous on this tune, and the final "alone,alone, alone, alone...ALONE" sent chills down my spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comparisons to Kelly Clarkson areinevitable and earned: a dark horse who keeps getting better and better and peaks when sheshould: the last three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OK, so I spent an hour watching clips and came to the same conclusion I did after reading all the online chatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's depressing :) The bottom three are Scott MacIntyre and Megan Joy andMichael Sarver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottom two are Megan Joy and Michael Sarver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And going home is...MichaelSarver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What do you think?

And theydon't include judge's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if they're gonna post them for free, why sell each videofor the obscenely high $1.50 on iTunes instead of the entire show for $2 like every othernetwork show on TV? Can't be music rights or they wouldn't have the individual clipsavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:24 PM on 03/29/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:54 PM on 03/27/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:43 PM on 03/30/2009Michael Giltz: American Idol -- Top 10: Motown http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----top_b_179579.html [4/2/2009 9:15:30 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Idol Adam Lambert Top 10 Watch Adam Lambert's Latest Idol Performance w/ Free Videos Toolbar Videos.alottoolbars.com</p>
