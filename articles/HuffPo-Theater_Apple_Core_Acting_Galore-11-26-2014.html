                <p>Theater: Apple Core; Acting Galore REGULAR SINGING ** out of **** AND AWAY WE GO ** out of **** REGULAR SINGING ** out of **** PUBLIC THEATER Going to visit your relatives during the holidays can be exhausting and exasperating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But oddly enough going to visit a friend's family during the holidays can beentertaining and amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't push your buttons, you don't have the same shared history and you know in the back of your mind that you never have to be around them again unless you decide you want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your friend goes slowly crazy while you smile and charm everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the fourth and final return to the Apple family should be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've been gathering on notable occasions for several years now in the plays by Richard Nelson:the mid-term elections of 2010, the tenth anniversary of 9-11, the 2012 election dayand now the 50th anniversary of the assassination of JFK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps it's acredit to the actors and the writing, but the Apple family has become real to a degreeand I head to their gatherings with a certain reluctance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are tiresomely liberaland acknowledge it just enough to -- in their minds -- excuse their blinkered outlookon the world and their own behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three sisters make me feel almostmisogynistic with their slow chipping away at the men around them, their suffering insilence which is anything but, their quicksand-like ability to pull you under the moreyou struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My goodness, one of them is the mother of a child that committedsuicide and I rarely feel any sympathy for her! Above all, there is Barbara (very well acted by Maryann Plunkett), a woman who annoyingly repeats the sentences of aging Uncle Benjamin (a wonderful JonDeVries).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Uncle Benjamin says, "I'm tired," she'll immediately announce, "He's tired." It's a good joke until Nelson typically beats it into the ground by repeating it about eight or so times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barbara wears down poor beleaguered Richard (Jay O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanders, great as always), wearing down his resistance to staying longer by constant requests like the dripping of water on a stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard is beset on all sides: when hissister Jane (Sally Murphy) visits him in Albany, she tells the others he seems to haveno friends and when Richard explains he merely wanted to spend his time with her.I'm going to go, he tries to say for the hundredth time as the family sits around whilethe ex-husband of Marian (Laila Robins) is slowly dying upstairs. "Don't go yet," saysBarbara, but of course "yet" means "ever." Don't ever go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marian has a failedmarriage and a dead daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane has a would-be actor for a husband she'sdragged to Rhinebeck while insisting he shouldn't give up on his dream of acting.Jane is also a failed writer, if you can fail at something you rarely ever start and neverfinish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barbara is a teacher and insists nobly that a life devoted to others is not a lifewasted and perhaps kids herself in insisting that her students are thrilled when UncleBenjamin comes to talk to the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a rare moment of insight, she also recognizesthat one of the perks of being a teacher is that people are forced to answer yourquestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, these people are exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After three plays, I'm not quite sure what attitude Nelson has towards them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can imagine these plays being done in a scathing style that mocks the pretensions and assumed worldview of these people, but satireseems far from his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regular Singing in fact ends with the characters turning to the audience for the first time in this quartet of plays and sharing how this is how we live, this is how we come together at times of great import to bond and grieve and celebrate and remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ifhe means these plays to embody our national coming together at moments of crisis, Ifear the major events are reduced to a trivial backdrop with the mundane concerns ofeveryday not putting those events in sharp relief but simply turning them into abackdrop for a banal exchange of information: how are the kids, how's your job, whois divorced now, who has moved away and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It neither informs the larger issuesat hand nor deepens our appreciation for "real" life, the lives that don't makeheadlines.May 16, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 11/26/2013 3:24 pmI mentioned misogyny earlier because it's worth noting how vastly improved the plays are when the men take center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the actors are uniformly strong (they certainly aren't the problem here) but when Sanders is talking, you sit up and notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seemsreasonable and his concerns, his comments actually seem rooted in what's going on,not the malicious or soul-deadening or self-absorbed observations that are invariablythe domain of the women depicted here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, Uncle Benjamin is a welcome voice as well, especially as embodied with autumnal grace by DeVries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelson uses the old trick of having Uncle Benjaminreading from other works, like Chekhov, so you're already a leg up there when itcomes to the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, when they're reading a news account of theKennedy assassination, Barbara interrupts literally every line of what she considers a brilliant piece with pedantic commentary until you want to tell her to for the love of God be quiet and let the piece be read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nelson doesn't seem to think her interruptions annoying though a different staging might have milked laughs by having the reader orother family members grow increasingly frustrated by her thinking this is a teaching moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uncle Benjamin usually seems the wisest person around, heading off stage for a cigarette on the back porch or sitting in a corner reading the letters of Jane Austen, ignoring everything that's going on around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the effect of these plays would be changed by seeing them in one week, rather than over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I doubt it; if anything their repetitive nature and lackof growth would be emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I seem to be in the distinct minority when finding thisfamily tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for me, spending a night much less a week with the Apples wouldmake me long for that blessed bus or train or plane ride back home, with home beingthe place where you're with your friends and not, I fear, your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AND AWAY WE GO ** out of **** PEARL THEATRE I've fallen in love with the Pearl Theatre Company in the last year or so as they've settled into their new home on 42nd Street on the (far) west side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What better way tocelebrate their 30th year than with a new play by Terrence McNally, especially a playthat celebrates acting and acting troupes throughout history? The set is a jumble room of a backstage, with props from all eras of history hanging from the rafters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One gets it immediately -- this is the Platonic ideal of a backstagesetting or the backstage that might be if all of theater history had taken place here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'salso a bit vague; one feels it might just as easily be a workroom or a messy basementof a junk store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's fine as far as it goes though ultimately it feels more genericthan universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins charmingly with each of the six actors stepping forward, kneeling down and kissing the stage and then stating their name, how long they've been with thecompany and their personal favorite and least favorite roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One and all, theircomments are amusing and charming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And away we go, first to ancient Greece whereactors are about to launch a performance of The Oresteia and then back and forth intime: the Burbages in England are about to do The Tempest, Versailles, Moscow for areading of The Seagull, the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami where Waiting ForGodot has been greeted with dismal disgust in 1956 and today where a theatercompany is struggling to survive financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is strong throughout, with the exception of Micah Stock, who tackles his many roles and suspect accents with the spirit of a Saturday Night Live sketch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not necessarily a bad idea since the scene changes begin to blur and ultimately it all feels like nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the others at times find moments of grace: the pause when those Greek actors realize an elderly talent is struggling with his linesand may be at the end of his career sticks in the mind, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean McNall isalways a welcome presence and is matched by the others in the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But many problems abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First and foremost, the play has no direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you can skip back and forth in time with no rhyme or reason, it becomes exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theaudience simply has no way to know where we're going or when we'll get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Somesort of spine is needed to keep us anchored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a suggestion the play mightcircumspectly show the changing role of women in the theater, from banned tobenefactor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One might also have easily developed a through-line, by starting with the reading of a play to rehearsals to opening night to the company facing a financial shutdown to afterhours when romance or at least passion blossoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wouldn't matter that the readingtook place in Moscow in 1896 or the rehearsal in ancient Greece and the intermissionin London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd feel the forward momentum by following the process of a play andknow where we were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, the play and the audience is rootless; it might haveended in half an hour or gone on for another two and it would be hard to tell thedifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead we just ping back and forth with no rhyme or reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't help thatdirector Jack Cummings III doesn't give us any clear indication when we've jumped time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes there's a distant rumble, other times there's a subtle lighting change or a sound effect of more notable character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet other times, I don'tbelieve there was any signal of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does it matter? Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One shouldn'thave to spend every minute trying to nail down what era we're in, especially when theslippery accents won't make it abundantly clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very few other clues are available(such as costumes or set) so some sort of device should guide our way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can understand the director's confusion, since McNally doesn't follow his own rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon people of different eras are criss-crossing paths with abandon and the audiencemust simply give up and wait for the end, gleaning what pleasure they can from a finecast doing their best with a shapeless, sloppy valentine to their craft and their world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
