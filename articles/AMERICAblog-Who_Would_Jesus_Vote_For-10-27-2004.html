"But Bush's senior political strategist, Karl Rove,said after the 2000 election that the president might have won therace against Democrat Al Gore by a comfortable margin had 4 millionmore evangelicals gone to the polls rather than sitting out theelection....""A poll published last week by the Pew Research Center for the Peopleand the Press found that 70% of self-described evangelicals orborn-again Christians planned to vote for the president, down from74% in the same survey three weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was not only aslight decline, but lower than the 80% to 90% support that Bushcampaign officials had been forecasting."In other words, the support for Bush among evangelical groups islower than 2000 -- when he lost the popular vote -- and in seriousfreefall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They got 80% last time and hoped to get 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they'relooking at 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is a major, major problem for Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hisrecent pandering -- I don't hate gay people, that General wasnaughty to say we're fighting a holy war against Satan -- ain't gonnahelp.By the way, as John has pointed out before, evangelicals are notsome monolithic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A significant minority support a woman'sright to choice. 1 out of 5 that voted in 2000 did NOT vote for Bush.All in all, it's the Good News for Kerry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New Comment Logged in as AnonymousUser Logout from DisqusLogged in asusing Facebook Connect (Logout) HuffPost PoliticsJeffrey Smith: Governor Sebelius Must Veto KansasBill That Endangers Milk Safety - Governor Sebeliuswants to be our new Secretary of Health andHuman Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But before she is sworn in, shehas an important job to...9 minutes agoDaily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's RescueRangers are Louisiana 1976, jlms qkw, shayera,dopper0189, ybruti, and srkp23 with vcmvo2editing.* ~ World order will be secured only ...24 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsC&amp;L's Late Night Music Club: The 50 State Strategywith The Pine Box Boys (CA) - Title: Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SkeletonArtist: The Pine Box Boys San Francisco isn'tknown for Bluegrass, but maybe if there weremore bands like The Pine Box Boys, it would ...29 minutes agoEschatonThe Stupids - When I was growing up what alwayspissed me off more than anything was when mysense of justice was violated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not claiming thatmy sense of such things...56 minutes agoFiredoglakeLate Nite: Michele Bachmann Stars in “Birth of anAberration” - Minnesota's wackiest export treadsthe boards of the Wingnut dinner theater.1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All Ads by GooglePlay American ExecCheckGerard Arpey's Salary Hurts Hurts AirlineWorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Play Now!www.AmericanExecCheck.comAMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Who ...http://www.americablog.com/2004/10/who-would-jesus-vote-for... 1 of 64/7/09 12:58 AM</p>
