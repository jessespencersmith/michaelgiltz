"That's right," says the actor,Niserian doctor in the tense thriller "D-irty Pretty Things" (2002), the calmly menacing villain iu last yer's sci-fi adventue "Serenity" or a classical pianist in Woody Allen's "Melinda md Melinda" (2004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But put him in knee-high red leather boots, with a towering wig and a microphone,..and Ejiofor Decomes a commanolng presence that is anything but quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inwho went clubbing to places lile Too Too Much in London's Soho to get pointers on drag queens. "He recorded albums in Nigeria iurd in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a group that includ- ed my mother md his mother on backing vocals." So even though he'd never sungprofessionally before, Ejiofor came by it naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shoes and the makeup? That was something entirely different. "Those 4 L/2-inch heels were the great cha.llenge of the part," says Ejiofor with a laugh. "They were very difficult to get used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had my eyebrows plucked, and my nails were soldered on so I couldn't actu- ally break them offat the end ofthe day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So they were with me the entire time." When he walked the streets or even ducked into his local pub for a drink, Ejiofor felt self-conscious, something he welcomed since Lola faced that. as well. md had to ovcr- come it "I did look for all intents and pur- poses, especia.lly if I was weaing a polo neck, like I was an off-duty drag queen," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plucked out of acting class for a small role in Steven Spielberg's "Amistad," Ejiofor has since worked with top directors like Allen, Spike Lee (iwice, including the current hit "Inside Man") and Stephen Freus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got two more films due out this year, includilg a drama with A.lfonso Cuar6n (director of "Y Tu Mana Tmbiâ‚¬n"), and a strong desire to get back onstage- After "Amistad," Ejiofor resisted Hollywood's call md returned to London because he felt he needed more trainins md he hadn't worked with major -theatrical companies like the National That move led to acclaimed roles as Romeo and his breakthroueh turn rn "slue/Orange," which led him to 'Dirty Pretty Things." Now he feels the pull of the the- ater agatn. "I'vE been looking to get back onstage for a while," says Ejiofor. "There comes a time when you've just been off-stage too long." 0H, MAN: out of drag, Chiwetel also appeared recently in "lnside Man."</p>
