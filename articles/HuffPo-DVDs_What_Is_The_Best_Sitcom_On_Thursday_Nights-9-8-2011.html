What's the best sitcom airing on Thursday nights? In the fall, two new shows -- How To Be A Gentleman and Whitney -- will try to join what has often been the best night for comedy on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now, the king of the night is The Big Bang Theory, at least according to the Nielsen ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can any of these NBC sitcoms claim to be better creatively?

($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- It's kind of sad but accurate to call this collection of shorts and one feature film "The Complete Jean Vigo." Hollywood has a cult for great actors who died young like James Dean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there any other director with such marvelous promise as Vigo, who was cut down by TB at 29years old? This beautifully restored collection -- you'd expect no less from Criterion -- includeseverything you could want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taris is a 9 minute nothing, an offhand look at a swimmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Propos De Nice is a more substantial 23 minute essay/slice of life from the city of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most intriguing of allis Zero De Conduite, a 44 minute tale of students rebelling at a boarding school, making it a fascinating precursor to If....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But above all there is L'Atalante, made in the same year as Zero (1933).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the most beautiful, romantic films of all time, it tells the simple story of young lovers on a canal barge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; L'Atalanteremains one of the greatest films of all time and a tantalizing hint of what might have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The others,especially Zero , prove Vigo's success was no fluke and he was clearly growing by leaps and bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bountiful extras include a great booklet, alternate edits, audio commentaries, a trifle of an animatedhomage by Michel Gondry and especially a TV chat about Vigo between Francois Truffaut and apompously self-important Eric Rohmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also just out on Criterion is If...., Lindsay Anderson's classic tale of anarchy at a British boarding school from 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By all rights, this film should seem dated andhopelessly of its period (the way Lord Of The Flies has dated).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, led by Macolm McDowell's magnetic lead performance, it's become a fable, a reckless cautionary tale that seems far more relevantthan many of the kitchen-sink dramas that came out of England in the previous decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of extras,including McDowell on audio commentary and from a making-of special, as well as Anderson's documentary about a school for the deaf which makes an odd, but intriguing double bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

Let's look at the numbers. it cost the most to make ($160 million) and made the least money in North America. (Worldwide, it's the second-lowest grossing after the original.) Financially,with $353 million coming in to cover the budget and major advertising and expenses to launch a film like this around the world, it's probably a wash, once you add in DVD and streaming and TV sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But how was the movie ? Here the news is much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Matthew Vaughan delivered the best in the series after the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following two positively dreadful movies -- X-Men: Final Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine -- they took a franchise that was a dead man walking and made it viable and cool again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sexy young cast led by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender made the movie about how the team came together fun and delivered by far the best standard of acting the series has yet to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may be a closecall for the accountants, but the surest proof that X-Men: First Class got the job done is that we're going to see another entry down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POLICE STORY SEASON ONE ($39.97; Shout) -- This show by novelist Joseph Wambaugh will always deserve a place in TV history as one of the series that advanced the complexity and authenticitywith which cops were portrayed in prime-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hill Street Blues and The Wire both owe a debt to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show was not based around certain cops, but an anthology series with new characters and storylinesevery week, sometimes delving into the big moments but just as often showing the drudgery that'sinvolved in fighting crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain characters reappeared while others -- notably Angie Dickinson asPolice Woman, a bigger hit -- got spun off into their own shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set contains all 21 episodes of the first season which aired on NBC in the 1973-1974 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quality varies, of course, but it's a notable show that deserves to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 12 Halle Berry's Flawless Bikini Bod Olsen Sister Flashes HerBra Scarlett's naked pics, TylerPerry is highest paid MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at People.comToscano Split READ MORE America's Got Talent Picksa Winner READ MORE Michaele Salahi Was NotKidnapped as Husband Claimed READ MORE Cher Lashes Out On 'Terrified' Chaz Bono Haters Getting Back To Her Roots?
