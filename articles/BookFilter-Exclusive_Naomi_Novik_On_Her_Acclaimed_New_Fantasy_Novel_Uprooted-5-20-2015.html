(When your beast of burden is a talking, fire-breathing dragon, questions of self-determination and slavery become a lot more interesting.)Even before the first book was published, it was optioned by director Peter Jackson (more on that in a minute).But other stories, other ideas have pushed their way in as Novik builds to the ninth and final volume of theTemeraire tales, due out in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One idea in particular wouldn't go away and the result is Uprooted, a stand-alone fantasy out now to considerable critical acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her peers in particular have praised it, with everyonefrom Ursula K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Le Guin to Lev Grossman to Tamora Pierce (the author Novik read in the school library as achild, rather than going out to play during recess) chiming in.Novik sat down with BookFilter to discuss her new book, her childhood, how her parents met and separated andmet again across the sea, a lost novel and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head to BookFilter for the complete interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlightsare below.Based on the Polish and Russian fairy tales her mother read to Novik as a child growing up in Staten Island,Uprooted begins in classic fashion with a corker of an opening line: "Our Dragon doesn't eat the girls he takes,no matter what stories they tell outside our valley." Novik has you immediately and never falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novelbegins with a ritual: the once-a-decade ceremony when the local wizard (nicknamed the "Dragon") chooses ayoung maid to take away to his tower, where she serves him in ways the locals can't imagine but spend an awfullot of time trying.Everyone simply knows the beautiful and winning Kasia will be chosen and yet it's our narrator Agnieszka thatthe Dragon almost reluctantly takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the fate of Agnieszka to the fate of her valley to the fate of thekingdom and indeed the world, the scope of this story slowly but inexorably expands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So does the magic,whether the highly detailed, scientific magic of the Dragon or the more creative, "instinctive" magic thatAgnieszka soon proves adept at.The medieval world Novik creates is as rooted in reality as her Napoleonic one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unlike most fantasy, whatyou remember best is not the world but the vivid and complex characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In what is ultimately a ratherremarkable novel, there are no genuine villains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh there is danger and evil aplenty (as symbolized by themalignant Wood that encroaches on Agnieszka's valley); armies clash, people struggle for power and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buttime and again Novik reveals characters driven not by a black heart but by sincere if sometimes misguidedimpulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, nothing is scarier than someone doing great evil for what they consider a higher purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In12/16/2015BookFilter Exclusive: Naomi Novik On Her Acclaimed New Fantasy Novel 'Uprooted' | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=c1ad3d77-de7d-48a0-abad-a70d98d43cab&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/2shortUprooted is the best and boldest novel she's written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far.NAOMI NOVIK ON HOW TO GET AN AGENT IN TWO EASY STEPSNovik is one-half of a publishing industry powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's an acclaimed, best-selling author and a championof online fan fiction (where Novik got her start) via the Organization For Transformative Works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her husbandCharles Ardai is an Edgar Award-winning author in his own right as well as the founder of the pulp fiction imprintHard Case Crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Novik tells how they met and her fortuitous path to getting an agent.NAOMI NOVIK ON BREAKING INTO THE FEDERAL RESERVENovik grew up in the 1970s surrounded by numbers and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her parents were steeped in them whileworking on computers after emigrating to the US from Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Novik describes making likeMatthew Broderick and playing early online games by remotely accessing the Federal Reserve computers.NAOMI NOVIK ON NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE VERSION OF TEMERAIREThe Temeraire series was optioned by Peter Jackson about a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novik remains a huge fan of thedirector, but after years of enthusing about the potential for a movie or TV series or something, Novik suddenlyclams up politely when the issue is broached yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the length of time that has passed, outsiders canonly surmise that the option has lapsed or someone else is circling the project or something is about to beannounced...or that a project that would be ridiculously expensive and difficult to mount may simply be on thebackburner for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You decide.This much is clear: Novik is not a one-trick pony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her Temeraire series was a clever idea: The Napoleonic Era!And dragons! Of course! But it is the execution that makes it an ongoing pleasure. (The final book will be out in2016.) And with Uprooted just released to acclaim and numerous other stories bursting to get out (led by an ideathat springs from The Secret Garden), we can safely say Novik won't be one of those authors who builds onegreat world and then gets trapped in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Temeraire is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head to BookFilter for the complete, in-depth interview.Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head toBookFilter if you want to find more great picks in every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover smart picks by our crackerjackstaff, not crowd-sourced reviews saying -- yet again -- hey, you should read "The Girl On A Train!"
