                <p>arts&amp;eatertaiameat f i I m Cooking with Kyra Kyra Sedgwick talks about going to lesbian bars with her costar Julianna Margulies to research their gay roles in What's Cooking? By Michael Giltz _ -I've kissed Paulina ~ ~ Porizkova, Helen Mir- ren, and Julianna Margulies, " laughs actress Kyra Sedg- wick. "God, people would kill to be in my shoes." The smooch with Porizkova came last spring during Sedgwick's "blink and you missed it" sitcom Talk to Me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her dalliance with the estimable Helen Mirren occurred in Losing Chase, a 1996 Showtime movie directed by Sedgwick 's hus­ band, Kevin Bacon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, in the new movie What's Cooking? (which opens in New York on No­ vember 10 and in Los Angeles and selected cities the fol­ lowing week), Sedg­ wick enjoys a loving relationship with ER star Margulies .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A comedic drama, What's Cooking? re­ volves around four families: a Jewish cou­ ple who are happy to have their lesbian daughter home for the holidays, as long as her "friend" remains just a friend in the eyes of the relatives ; an upper-class black family with Alire Woodard as a mother seem­ ingly at loose ends; a Vietnamese family featuring an unrecogniz ­ able Joan Chen as the tradition­ happy matriarch; and a Latino family headed by Mercedes Ruehl as the separated mom ready to date again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite other subplots involv­ ing marital strife, a loaded gun kept hidden by a teenager, and in­ terracial dating that gives parents on both sides conniption fits, the characters played by Sedgwick and Margulies are at the heart of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They gamely endure THE ADVOCATE 1881 NOVEMBER 21, 2000 the questioning of guests who want to know when they'll meet the right man, let Mom (Lainie Kazan) come into their room in the morning (with the single beds still pushed together), and try to make the best of an awkward situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the friendly and slightly raunchy Sedgwick (who perks up whenever she tosses off an expletive or two), she and Mar­ gulies were made for each other. "We both care about the same things," explains the 35-year-old New York City native. "We both are women who won't take a lot of shit from anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're very in touch with our male sides as well as our female sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And we're women who really expect to be treated as equals." In other words, they'd both make good les­ bians? "Yeah!" she laughs. "I think so." And Sedgwick also confesses to a bit of curiosi- ty. "Honestly, I've always been slightly saddened by the fact that I had never had a lesbian come on to me," admits the actress, who currently stars off-Broadway in Stranger [see review, page 96], a new play by Craig Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since she's married to Kevin Bacon and the mother of two, Sedgwick's chances to be the object of a woman's affection seemed remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, when she and Mar­ gulies hit the New York City bars to prepare for their roles, Sedg­ wick thought there might be awk­ ward situations at the places where she and Margulies hung out as "tourists." "I expected a little anger, a little 'What the fuck are you doing here?'" says Sedgwick, who mentions Henrietta Hud-~</p>
