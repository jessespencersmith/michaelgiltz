                <p>TNEATEB Th rime of Penning plays, directing movies-now he's writing the book for a major musical,ls there anything Craig Lucas can't do? By ilichael Giltz $hate breaking the law," moans New York-based writer Craig Lucas about talking to The Aduocate on his cellphone whlle driving to afllm premiere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody catches him in the act, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lately his life is too charmed for that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucas, who tums 54 on April 30, has e4loyed wide success with plays like the recently revived Reckless and screenplays like the Oscar-nominated Longti,me Companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His personal life is in fine shape too, thanks to a happy six-year relatiorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with all that life be- hind him, Lucas is peaking only now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He made his fllm di- rectorial debut at Sundance wlth TLte Dyi,ng GauI, wtich he adapted from his own play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His hugely ambitious drama Si,n ging Forest-a 2 l0-minute opLs involving Fleud, Nazis, gay love, and redemption-was a hit at the tong Wharf in New Haven, Conn His adaptation of Qhe}ltois Thtee Sisterc ts premiering this zummer at Seat- tle's Intiman Theatoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the moment, all eyes arc on T'lw Light in the Piazza, Lucas's first original musical, opening April 18 at Lincoln Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A collaboration with lyricist- composer Adam Guettel-a New Yorkcritical favorite who also happens to be the grandson of Richard Rodgers- Piazza stands in stark contrast to this season's broad musical comedies like Spamalot and Di,rty Rotten Scoundrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on a novella by Eliza- beth Spencer, Piazza tells the delicate story of a mother and daughter vacationing in Flo- rence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The daughter falls for a well-born local Italian boy; the mother wavers between support and resistance; afeel I've found an ideal collaborator in Adam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's an absolutely meticulous, almost maniacally concentrated, fo- cused, brilliant, adaptable colleague." What happens after Pi,azza opens? More theater projects, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Lucas also plans to direct another film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon. "I loved it, I loved it, I loved it," says Lucas about directing. "I would do it again in a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have not always taken the best care of myseH or others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think I've had a reckless life in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since I started directing movies, I have to take better care of myself be- cause you can't help support other peo- ple who are having crises if you're not healthy and centered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like I found a whole different part of myself, and thank God-I'm 53, almost 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's abouttime."

[The story] spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I felt like I fell into a pot ofjam." Lucas is just as enthusiastic about Guettel.
