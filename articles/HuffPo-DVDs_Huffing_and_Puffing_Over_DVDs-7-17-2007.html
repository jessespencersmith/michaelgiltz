And time can have that effect on art: revealing over-looked masterpieces and consigning once popular works to theash heap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just look at this week's releases on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BillyWilder'scorrosive1951 dramaAce in theHole(Criterion; $39.95) was a huge commercial flop when it came out --especially since it was bracketed by his Oscar-winning triumphSunset Boulevard and the hit comedy-drama Stalag 17 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilder and swaggering lead actor Kirk Douglas couldn't get America to cotton to this acidic tale of a down and out reporter whomanipulates a tragic accident to kick-start his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing ages better than cynicism.Today, its clear-eyed dissection of a media frenzy is hilarious and not even remotely exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And time has given some much-needed perspective to 1984's Red Dawn (MGM; $19.98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was morning in Ronald Reagan's America when this escapist tale about high school kids defeating the invading Russians was a modest hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But critics frantically feared writer-director John Milius'sfantasy starring C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas Howell and Patrick Swayze might actually inspire World War III byinflaming jingoism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, the Russians -- seen parachuting onto a small town school's footballfield in the iconic opening scene -- could just as easily have been aliens or Vikings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The importantfact for our heroes was not the nature of the enemy but their own bravery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They wanted to playwith guns and die bravely, not debate SALT II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The passage of time also lets us look anew at World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We can find nuances and ugly truths that had to be avoided when the fighting was fierce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foyle's War -- perhaps the best British mystery series since Prime Suspect -- has spent four seasons tackling the UK home front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Foyle's War IV (Acorn; $59.99) you'll find marvelous explorations of resentment against the Yanks, secret Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!
