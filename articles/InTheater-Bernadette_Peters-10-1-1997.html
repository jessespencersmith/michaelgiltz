(Perhaps the animators took inspira­ tion from an early review of Peters in The New York Post which said, "She has a rear end like a Bartlett pear.") Peters still hasn't seen the finished film, but she's an old hand at animation; she's been tile voice of Rita on the cartoon series Aninzaniacs for several years, attracting a new generations of fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, because she's been so active in other areas. "I'm too busy to be frustrated," she laughs. (One upcoming possibili­ ty is Kander and Ebb's The Skin of Our Teeth.) It's also easy for theatergoers to forget what an impressive body of work she's done for Tv, including David, Falling Fronz G1·ace with Kevin Spacey and The Last Best Year with Mary Tyler Moore, who has become one of her best friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, Peters was married to investment adviser Michael Wittenberg in Moore's home last year.

"I love doing concerts," she says. "I can choose what I want to sing, and I'd rather do that than a musical that isn't interesting to me." Her love for live performance is the reason why Sondheinz, Etc. (Angel), last year's CD taped at Carnegie Hall, is easily the highlight of her recording career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly it outshines I'll Be Yozt?'
