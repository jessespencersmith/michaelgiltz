' _ NEW YORK POST, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1999 TVSundav .., The last Elvis sighting of the millennium ... and other really important stuff Tv is ready to cover Y2K meltdowns, riotli in the streets and even the Second Coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unlike the rollover from 1999 to 2000, net­ works can't really COUll t on any of those excitingly newsworthy events actual­ ly taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, just to be safe, they've lined up proven ratings grabbers : musical super­ stars, marathon s of classic TV shows, and of course Dick Clark in Times Square for ABC's "Rockin' New Year's Eve." Here are some of the other highlights channel surfers can catch during the three-day fest. -Jay Leno may be ahead in the ratings, but it's David Letterman who's being treated like a VlP this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leno's "Tonight Show" is reduced to just his mono­ logue and a sketch before NBC cuts back to Times Square and well-known funny man Tom Brokaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Letterman, on the other hand, gets his own lavish, two-hour primetime spe­ cial. -The cleverest mara­ thon idea has to go to the Discovery Channel, which is hosting round-the-clock specials devoted to bugs - but not the Y2K kind, just the squishy, there-are-a­ lot-more-of-them-than-us kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other familiar marathon standbys include "Andy Griffith" on TBS, "Twilight Zone" on Sci-Fi and the Three Stooges on AMC. -MTV's reckless young audience apparently has no fear: Lucky contest win­ ners will jump on a "Fly 2K" plane to jet over to Cairo, Paris, Rome and London when their parents are nervously avoiding air­ line travel like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MTV will also host an eight-hour Times Square bash from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., featuring Puff Daddy, Bush, Blink 182 and oth­ ers. -Nickelodeon's even younger audience is being treated more thoughtfully : They1l watch a commer­ cial-free 24-hour documen­ tary with kids all over the world discussing their hopes for the new millenni­ um. -A similarly weighty tone will pop up on Pax (with its quietly religious tone perfect for focusing on the spiritual celebrations in Rome and elsewhere) and PBS (where composer Tan Dun's "2000 Today - A World Symphony for the Millennium" serves as the official theme song). -The History Channel is a safe haven for the pop­ star-weary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will broad­ cast the "Mega Millennium Marathon ,' 37 hours of episodes from series like "The Century: America's Time" and "The Times Capsule.' -Anyone who can't wait for new episodes of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" should tune in to the Game Show Network: It's focwt­ iog on the last day of the century by rebroadcasting the final episodes of shows like "Double Dare," "Super Password" and ·Card Sharks." -Finally, there's certain to be at least one Elvis sighting: Hell be on TCM, swiveling his hips through flicks like "Jailhouse Rock" and "Viva Las Vegas'" -Michael Giltz</p>
