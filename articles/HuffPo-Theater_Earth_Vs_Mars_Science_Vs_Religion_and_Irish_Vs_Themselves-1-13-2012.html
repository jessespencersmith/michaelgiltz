Just asperfunctory as the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW THE WORLD BEGAN * 1/2 PETER JAY SHARP THEATREThis is an "issue" play in search of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Catherine Trieschmann's drama, the liberal New York science teacher Susan (Heidi Schreck) has come to Plainview Kansas in the wake of a disaster to offer her help and pitch in at the local high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Micah (Justin Kruger) is the awkward student who comes to her with a concern about a comment she made in class on evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gene (the always solid AdamLeFevre) is the adult caring for Micah now that the boy is an orphan (that disaster again).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's apparent very quickly that Susan made a gratuitous and unnecessary comment mocking the religious beliefs of anyone who thinks that life on earth was created by God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She calls any other theorygobbledygook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one asked her to teach religious beliefs in her science class (such as Creationismdisguised as Intelligent Design).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No student asked her about the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She just casually and wronglytossed out the barb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Micah calls her on it and thinks she should apologize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Susan denies it, the problemescalates, she soon admits having made the statement and concedes it might have been not the best thingto do and in the ensuing discussion finds it difficult to go five minutes without cursing or taking theLord's name in vain. (Oh, those liberal New Yorkers!) The problem with this problem play is that there is no problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Micah is a sad kid but he's quite reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His unofficial guardian Gene is even more straightforward and friendly and accommodating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now a bad teacher or a person incapable of not ruffling feathers or a woman determined to raise a little hell or too clueless to realize she's in the wrong -- I suppose any of this could create a decent drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the play doesn't really acknowledge how essentially wrong Susan is in her actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, in a desperate attempt to pump up the tension, we're tossed all sorts of red meat like the fact that this single woman is also visibly pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's the unnamed disaster which goesunexplained for too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After far too much murky reference (was it a terrorist attack?), it turns out tobe just a tornado that killed a number of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why the mystery?Toss in Micah's burning guilt overthe death of his hated step-dad (a particularly lame twist) and the burning of a scarecrow on the teacher'slawn and you've got a whole lot of nothing that can't disguise the fact that if the central character in thisdrama wasn't a bad teacher who refuses to apologize for a rude and unnecessary comment that there'd beno story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeFevre is most effective at making the decent, friendly Gene into a convincing person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kruger has to carry some heavy personal loads and almost keeps Micah genuine up to the absurd late twists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Schreck has such a poorly written and unlikeable character she can do little with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set and costumes by Clint Ramos are simple and effective though by and large the efforts of director Daniella Topol and her teamare wasted on a dull work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this weren't a drama written by a woman, directed by a woman andpresented by Women's Project Theater along with South Coast Repertory, the suggestion that at leastsome of the teacher's foolish actions can be explained by her pregnancy would be risible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) The Most Awkward Wedding Photobombs PHOTO: Christina Aguilera's 'Your Body' Dress Doesn't Leave Much To The Imagination DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 John Hillcoat Lawless: Reinventing the Gangster Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben Cardin This Is No Way to Win an Election TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2Like 2k Like 753 Like 201 Surprising New Aniston Rumor Kim K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wants Hollywood Star Alanis Morissette Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson's Shocking Tweets About Isaac Jon Voight Blasts Obama Administration, Mainstream Media Shia LaBeouf Dropped Acid For His New Film WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin Teaching evolution in high school is a delicate subject fraught with danger for teachers (who often and unfortunately avoid the topic as much as possible for that very reason).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No natural disasters, hot-buttonissues like single motherhood or deep dark secrets are needed to turn it into compelling drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andwhen those things are present, they can't disguise the lack of drama either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 The Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Close Up Space * Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Dedalus Lounge * 1/2 An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Godspell ** 1/2 Goodbar * 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 How The World Began * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** Lake Water ** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Lysistrata Jones * Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Maple And Vine ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** Mission Drift * 1/2 Misterman ** 1/2 The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies ** Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Once *** 1/2 Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 On A Clear Day You Can See Forever * 1/2 One Arm *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Private Lives ** Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Radio City Christmas Spectacular ** 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 Samuel &amp; Alasdair: A Personal History Of The Robot War ** 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Seminar ** Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Shlemiel The First ** 1/2 Silence!
