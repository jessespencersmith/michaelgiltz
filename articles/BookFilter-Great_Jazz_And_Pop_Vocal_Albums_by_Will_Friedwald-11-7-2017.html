But thanks to Friedwald's enthusiasm, I've alsolistened to some great albums I've never heard before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The excuse for all this fun is a sort of desert island discs roundup of his favorites, from Carmen McRae and Ella Fitzgerald to offbeat choices like Tiny Tim (!) and Della Reese's contribution to the Latin craze. imagine if Friedwald were asked to provide liner notes to the reissue of any of these albums and you'll geta sense of what he's doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From artist to artist, Friedwald varies his insights, ranging from the songwriters an artist workedwith to the cheapskate managers that hurt their recordings (Armstrong was usually asked to record his albums late at nightAFTER doing a full concert and thus vocally exhausted) to the perennial mystery of how Doris Day is under-appreciated by so many, starting with Day herself. (Friedwald has made me gaga over her albums "Day By Day" and "Day By Night" and especially the where-have-you-been-all-my-life masterpiece that is her studio recording of the songs from "Annie Get YourGun" alongside Robert Goulet.) Friedwald has always been a reliable and informative guide to the great jazz and pop vocalalbums that flourished especially in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I happily agreed with some choices and argued with others (I'm still not sold on Eydie Gormé and Steve Lawrence) but thanks to streaming sites, almost anyone can sample the music right away and hear for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only way I could enjoy this more is if I had Friedwald there to debate with and enthuse over somuch great music. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Will Friedwald's thoughtful analysis and insight into the background and nuances of the music by the artists featured in his book make each song a more enriching experience for casual listeners and music aficionadosalike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm honored to be included and grateful to Will for keeping the American Songbook and jazz classicsrelevant for generations to come." —Doris Day “Absolutely indispensable . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friedwald . . . brings his rare abilityto write about singing in a way that effectively bridges impressionistic interpretation with musical analysis to the task of ‘reading’ an album the way a literary critic reads a poem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is never less than perceptive and often stop-in-your tracks brilliant . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A magnificent achievement.” —Bill Ott, Booklist (starred review) "Withverve and an infectious love of music, jazz critic Friedwald tells the stories of fifty-seven jazz and pop albumsthat have become benchmarks by which subsequent records have been measured. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His passionate descriptionof each album in this indispensable guide will drive readers to listen to the albums once again, or for the firsttime." —Publishers Weekly, starred review What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
