Intrigued or bullied or most likely just procrastinating before writing a review (not this one!) I pored over my lists of each and every work of theater I've seen since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grabbing together all the shows I gave three and a half stars or a very rare four stars, the result was a good pile of stuff and some happy memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain names popped up again and again: PigPen Theater Co., Philip Glass, Bedlam, Mark Rylance, Harriet Walter, Lucas Knath and Daniel Kitson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PigPen is a theater company/rock band poised to find its biggest audience yet with their new show The Tale of Desperaux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I finally saw all three of composer Philip Glass's "portrait operas" thanks to remarkable revivals of Satyagraha in 2011, Einstein On The Beach in 2012 and -- just under the wire -- Akhnaten a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bedlam created some of the best revivals, pivoted to bold new works and has now fissioned into two companies one hopes will produce twice as much heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rylance and Walter are obviously two of the best actors around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Hnath and Kitson are two of our best playwrights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching Lucas Hnath produce one intriguing, thoughtful, playful work after another; seeing him smartly create pieces that are challenging but easy to produce for companies around the country (he's no fool); marveling as he grew in reputation until his triumphant Broadway debut with the brilliant, Tony-winning A Doll's House, Part 2 has been a thrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is exactly how it's supposed to work.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached at mgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blog Deep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp;

Like Hnath, Kitson has his own regional support system to try out and refine new pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his goal is not greater and greater attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He keeps ticket prices and production costs low, always, and that gives him the freedom to do precisely what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a remarkable body of work I might compare to Spalding Gray or Eric Bogosian but that's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not confessional or personal; it's certainly not stand-up (which Kitson also does) though I think of him and Eddie Izzard in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's work that is uniquely his own -- funny, piercing, deeply human, sneakily complex and open-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any time Hnath or Kitson come to NYC with a new show, it's an event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither quite sticks the landing in their new piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I wouldn't miss either of them, ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, the Hnath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucas Hnath's new play is stripped down to almost the bare essentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage is bare and unadorned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set consists of two chairs with a small table between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast consists of four actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I think it should have been stripped down even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hnath's plays love to explore public performance from scientific debate (Isaac's Eye ) to the Sunday sermon ( The Christians ) to a reading ( A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now with The Thin Place he tackles one of the oldest performance genres of all: the ghost story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilda slips onto the stage rather apologetically, carrying a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sits down and begins to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lonely child, a beloved grandmother who played games where they tried to read each other's minds and -- when the grandmother dies -- secret seances where the child Hilda tries to pierce the veil to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She tries and fails to find the thin place, that rare physical location where this world and the next rub shoulders.The Movies, Books, Theater, Concerts, CDs I Saw/Re...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Two Of Our Best Playwrights Return To NYC...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Hilda becomes a devotee and then a disciple and then perhaps a friend of Linda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as Hilda tells her story, Linda strides onto the stage, almost indifferent to Hilda and us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We are beneath her notice or perhaps merely beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linda carries the story forward and their onstage pas de deux is intriguing, a little mystifying and even creepy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Linda carefully makes clear to Hilda that what she does isn't exactly real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She doesn't say, "I'm a fraud" exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can't help sitting up straight and wondering how the gullible and odd Hilda will react to Linda patiently explain how she does what she does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a genuine service and provides comfort to her clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's not precisely speaking to the dead so much as telling the living what they desperately want to hear: you are loved, I forgive you, there is something more than this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then two more people burst onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jerry and Sylvia are friends of the psychic Linda, which is no surprise since you don't imagine Hilda has any friends to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, all sorts of new threads are introduced: Linda is working as a consultant for a politician, Sylvia supports Linda financially and is clearly jealous of Linda's new friendship (and perhaps romance) with Hilda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just when we get a handle on these interlopers, they fade away and we get back to the purpose at hand, telling a spooky tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a few effective bumps in the night, that final story didn't get under my skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's easy to imagine Hnath had a two-hander, got stuck and decided to give his story a jolt by having two new characters barge their way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a ghost story needs a relentless focus and distractions are not welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since everything Jerry and Sylvia introduce is beside the point, it's a shame Hnath didn't disappear them and stick with what works so well here: the complicated and uncertain relationship between Linda and Hilda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the technical team and director Les Waters gave Hnath everything he wanted, though I'd need to return to the show to decide how I felt about a few abrupt touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while it's easy to think Mimi Lien could hardly go wrong with a bare stage, two chairs and a table, they feel like exactly the right two chairs and table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oana Botez's costumes are also perfectly judged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the two interlopers, Triney Sandoval and Kelly McAndrew do what they can with limited roles and no certain purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Emily Cass McDonnell is very good as the unobtrusive Hilda, a character that recedes into the background as much as possible while always making her presence felt. (After a long stretch of saying nothing, when Hilda finally speaks up at a party the effect is hilarious.) And Randy Danson is a treat as the psychic Linda, commanding the stage with aplomb from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her British by way of the Caribbean (?) accent wavers a bit, but it doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I generously took that as adding to the unreliability of everything Linda says, though the dodgy accent is2/24/2020 POPSURFING.COM: THEA TER: T wo Of Our Best Playwrights Return T o NYC popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -two-of-our -best-playwrights.html 4/7not intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danson is wonderful, utterly convincing as she explains away her psychic gifts one minute and just as passionately defends them the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't read minds, but just as Hnath worked again with Laurie Metcalfe I'll bet he'll find another piece to showcase Danson's talents soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now Kitson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a busy man, doing stand-up, hosting benefit shows with other comics, deejaying on his local radio station for two weeks every year and traveling the globe doing his "story shows." His Wikipedia page gives a sense of that prodigious output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've sadly never seen his stand-up and while gladly catching every single work of theater he's staged in NYC, that still means I haven't seen half of what he's done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So any guess as to the shape of his career is naturally blinkered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The likely mistaken impression I've received is that increasingly passionate critical raves were a little unsettling to Kitson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wary of adulation or simply believing his success was coming too easily, he turned his Rube Goldberg-like plays into truly dense Borgesian contraptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if god forbid he felt a climax proving too emotional or touching, Kitson ran in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bollocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His plays have always been dauntingly complex, despite the ease with which he pulls them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And though it briefly seemed Kitson was trying to make things difficult for himself (one show involved reel- to-reel machines with pre-recorded bits; it didn't work), he's delivered the goods before and since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2014 (just five years ago), Kitson created his most open-hearted piece with A Show For Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And four of his plays are among my favorites of the 2010s, more than any other artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep won't be on it, but it's often very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage is bare and plunged into darkness except for a table and chair and behind that a filing cabinet with dozens of drawers containing index cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kitson tells us he spent six months cataloguing every single item in his rambling home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each item gets one index card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he's going to read them off to us, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will, he assures, have a fascinating cumulative power but it's not for the faint-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to leave, by all means do so now and you'll get a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then he begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Problems ensue and with them pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shape of the show slowly reveals itself, along with what seem to be digressions and diversions and casual improvisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By and large, not a word is wasted since we realize every offhand comment has a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The audience -- fans one and all -- are with him every step of the way, laughing at jokes that are set-up with an aside at one moment and then landed with a quick jab maybe half an hour later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It demands attention and receives it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kitson's plays are often labyrinthian pieces, letting us wander through his idiosyncratic worldview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at the heart of the maze is not some minotaur-like beast, but a willingness to embrace humanity in all its quirks and failings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They often click into place with a delightful snap at2/24/2020 POPSURFING.COM: THEA TER: T wo Of Our Best Playwrights Return T o NYC popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -two-of-our -best-playwrights.html 5/7the end, like placing the final piece of a puzzle into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't quite happen here, for some stray details muddy the effect and confuse the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I sound like the Emperor in Amadeus by declaring Keep has "too many drawers!" it's not because the show needs to be shorter, as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's because once we know the shape it's taking, filling in the dots should happen as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd spend hours in Kitson's brain but once we know where we're going the play needs to get there quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, what a performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I often think of Kitson the writer and Kitson the wit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't often think of Kitson the actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His pieces are fiendishly elaborate and difficult; Keep might just be the trickiest of all to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lifetime of stand-up, of delivering complex stories with ease and of winning over an audience to the challenges he's going to set them allows Kitson to be at his best here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep may not be a keeper, but Kitson along with Hnath remains on the short list of artists I'd follow anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
