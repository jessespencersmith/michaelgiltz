The media is not always good at passing along good news, especially when it involves things nothappening, like people not starving to death or young people getting an education rather than being denied one orcommunities not being wiped out by disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, Steven Radelet does a strong job of marshaling his factsto make clear that humanity is in the midst of one of the most remarkable accomplishments in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To be blunt, incountry after country around the world, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty at a rate neverseen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, because of population growth, never before in history has the actual number of people inpoverty fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've fallen as a percentage before, which is an important metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But to fall overall is even moreimpressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a surge that has taken place over decades, beginning with the end of World War II and sent into highgear with the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Radelet doesn't focus on just the poverty rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He looks at poverty, health care,education and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And before you can offer some caveats or raise some questions he does it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedemonstrates remarkable strides made across countless countries (and he repeatedly takes China out of theequation just so you can see how one country hasn't skewed the results).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is conservative when determining whichcountries have functioning democracies, however fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He paints a vivid story of the success in Africa, a storyvirtually ignored or misunderstood because it seems to go against what everyone "knows" about Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Radelet isnot a wide-eyed optimist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, after charting multiple possibilities for the future and recognizing the manyways progress can be slowed or halted (it rarely moves forward in a smooth line), he remains strongly convinced thathumanity can and will continue to see this stunning progress continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who would have expected the world to beatvarious ambitious targets for fighting poverty around the globe...five years ahead of time? The storytelling is minimaland Radelet's prose simply straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's getting out the news as clearly and concisely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The morepeople know what has already been accomplished, the more they may rally around what can be done in the next 30years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an inspiring possibility and anyone hungering for good news should start right here. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Powerful, lucid, and revelatory, The Great Surge makes a vital argument and offers indispensable prescriptionsabout sustaining global economic progress into the future.” - George Soros, chairman of Soros FundManagement“Steven Radelet in a brilliant new book demonstrates out how the world has actually gotten better in recent years, notby a little but by a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a careful antidote to today's fashionable pessimism and should be read by everyone.” -Francis Fukuyama, author of The End of History“With the airwaves filled with news of insurrection, desperation, and still stubborn diseases, this book jars you out ofa clichéd response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With his typical care and detail, Steve describes humanity’s greatest hits over the last twentyyears—never have we lived in a time when so many are doing so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The job surely isn’t done, but these pagesprovide the evidence the job can be done, if we choose to do it.” - Bono, lead singer of U2 and co-founder of ONEand (RED)“Steven Radelet is one of the leading development thinkers and practitioners in the world today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This captivatingbook shows that progress for the world's poor is not just…</p>
