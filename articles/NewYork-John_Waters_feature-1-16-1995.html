                <p>W ~r;,~n,., Pussycat! Kill! Kill! he sweetest kittens have the sharpest claws," read one of the ads for director Russ Meyer's low路 budget Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (At Film Forum January 13-26.' John Waters, the director of Pink Flamingos and Hairspray, once wrote that the 1965 film was, "beyond a doubt, the best movie ever made ... possibly better than any film that will be made in the Mure." And time hasn't dulled Waters's enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's more than happy to take time out of his busy schedule to discuss its many virtues. "You can tell a Russ Meyer movie right away," he says. "The fast cutting, way before M1V; big breasts; nasty dialogue; and women in con路 troll" Waters first saw the movie at a drive-in in his hometown of BaHimore and was hooked. "I went back every night and took different people," he says. "Divine and I saw it many, many times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; H was certainly an influence--and Russ would probably be surprised to hear thi~n the Divine character." A drive-in seems like the perfect place to experience Pussycat in all its glory, but Waters disagrees. "No, I think it would be great to see in Buckingham Palace, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it deserves more than the drive路in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get its proper place in critical history, it has to be shown in New York." But what is its proper place? As a sexploitation classic? As camp? "It's as a great action mOllie, with the kind of movie stars we're hard路pressed to find anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who are exploitation stars anymore? There aren't any, because Hollywood makes exploitation movies now and they aren't as much fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The golden age of trash has been over for many years." So is classic dialogue. "One of my favorite lines," he says, "is when Tura Satana pulls into a gas station and the gas station attendant is looking down her blouse, and she says, 'You won't find it down there, Columbus!' " So it's not to be dismissed as a glorious bit of soft-core naughtiness? "Well, Russ did not want to ever do hard-core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He came as close as you could get to it and never did, which I think was wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AHhough God knows he could make a good one."
