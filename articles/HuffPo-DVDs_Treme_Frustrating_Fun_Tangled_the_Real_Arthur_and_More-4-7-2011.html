Yet, what a cast! The great Khandi Alexander gets a role worthy of hertalents as the bar owner, Wendell Pierce is funny and wonderful as the trombonist who juggles numerouswomen; and Clarke Peters is subtle and moving as the Indian chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The white roles and actors invariablycome off weaker, including John Goodman, Melissa Leo and Steve Zahn. (It's the writing, not them.) Theexception is Kim Dickens as the restaurant owner, perhaps the only one in New Orleans who doesn'tknow when setting up an outdoor cooking business that you must always be prepared for rapid changesin weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could spend days mapping out exactly what frustrated me this first season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, I'llwatch in season two as they pull it together and deliver the show I know they are capable of producing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TANGLED ($39.99 BluRay combo or $29.99 regular DVD; Disney) -- It's been more than a decade since Disney (not Pixar) delivered a wholly satisfying animated movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was 1999's blockbuster Tarzan and now it's joined by Tangleda a spin on Rapunzel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not absolute peak Disney, but it's very solid fun from start to finish, with Many Moore's Rapunzel given a far more active role than in the fairy tale, ZacharyLevi very winning as the thief with a heart of gold Flynn Rider, and a raft of good songsby Alan Menken.A spotlight must be shone on the horse Maximus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This non-speaking role steals the show from the veryfirst moment he bursts onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part bloodhound, part Inspector Javert and all hero, Maximus is Striking Distance Of Obama Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

No, unless it gets such rapturous reviews I feelcompelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, I never even saw Arthur 2: Arthur On The Rocks because it seemed so unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's included on this modestly priced double feature which has no extras to speak of other than theoriginal trailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRON: LEGACY/TRON: THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC COMBO ($79.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- While Arthur is a terrible movie to remake, Tron is a perfect one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original had a cool concept, lots ofname recognition but wasn't actually any good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the reboot isn't any better but boy doesthis set offer everything you could possibly want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a BluRay version of the new film in 3-D and 2-D and a 2-D version on a regular DVD plus a digital copy AND a DVD of the original film! Plus, needlessto say, loads and loads of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Various other editions offer the new movie in less expensive and regular DVD only versions, but they're too numerous to mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Undoubtedly in another 20 or so years someone will try again with this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Life inside a computer is just too natural an idea not to explore andwe do it more and more every day anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe they'll do a comic spin by landing our hero in Twitterand force all dialogue to be limited to 140 characters?

Like 343 Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump Rip Each Other In Heated Political War Of Words TOPSY-TURVY/THE MIKADO ($39.95 each on BluRay; Criterion) -- These two BluRay releases create one of the most delightful double bills imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First comes Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy, a look at operetta impresarios Gilbert &amp; Sulivan as they create their masterpiece The Mikado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leigh has createdmany films I love (incuding Another Year, which comes out on DVD June 7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this atypical 2 hour and40 minute drama is his masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's filled with a love of theater and actors and the act of creation.Then you can turn to the 1939 movie The Mikado which features members of D'Oyly Carte OperaCompany, the troupe G&amp;S founded to showcase their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a rare bauble of a film from the greatestyear in Hollywood history, both stage-bound and effervescent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then comes the real shocker: the usually gruff and abrupt Leigh (who hates doing press) is warm and forthcoming when discussing this 1939 movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He shares his opinion and even politely offers up countering opinions of others about the casting,the addition of scenes and other marginalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His passion and love for G&amp;S shines through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both moviesare presented with the usual Criterion care and a bevy of insightful extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Japan Earthquake Libya NBA Afghanistan Fast Food Gas &amp; Oil NASA Hockey Brian Williams MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Like 4K mayhemstudios RT @sbeasla : What happens when you tickle a little penguin? http://j.mp/dEZjCM via @huffingtonpost twsuccess Antoine Dodson Arrested For Marijuana Possession http://huff.to/edLaIo BLACK SWAN ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular; FOX) -- This is unquestionably one of the success stories of 2010: a dance film with a psychological bent a la Polanski that proved a hit with critics and a genuine worldwide smash hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It cost $13 million to make and grossed an astonishing $292 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story of a prima ballerina who is going mad under the pressure of performance, it contains some fun spicy work by Mila Kunis and an effective Barbara Hershey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I found the whole thing rather silly but many, many people disagree with me and I'm glad a clearly ambitious serious film provedso successful, even winning an Academy Award for star Natalie Portman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That can only mean good thingsfor director Darren Aronofsky and his mercurial career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($199.99; Acorn) -- One of the all- time greats, this TV series is one to savor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unexpected batch of new episodes begins on PBS thisSunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longtime fans and newcomers should all dive into the original which goes from black and whiteto color but always maintains the highest standards of acting and writing. (Production is another matter.On early episodes, the sets are so rickety I sometimes fear if an actor leaned against a wall it wouldtopple over.) This set contains all five seasons, which are marvelous from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not quiteready to rewatch the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this set is bursting with extras, including one hour retrospectives forevery season that go into delicious detail about studio machinations, infighting, changes to stories and characters and other dish that fans will love. it also includes the 25th anniversary retrospective and audio commentaries for 24 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet I still don't know why Eileen Atkins isn't anywhere to be heardfrom. (If I missed her in all the wealth of extras, you'll understand.) On a negative note, the show is longoverdue for remastering but does not get it here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Picture and sound are fine but should have been better.I LOVE YOU, PHILLIP MORRIS ($39.98 BluRay or $27.98 regular DVD; Lionsgate) -- Is it possible to over-emphasize chemistry? It's a magical blending of two actors that can't really be predicted even with screen tests and readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You just never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This film by the writers of Bad Santa stars Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor as two prison inmates who fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrey is an inveterate con man andgives McGregor the lavish life Carrey believes they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Carrey's illegal activities keep getting himthrown into jail and away from his love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's unacceptable so he begins a series of clever prison escapesthat made him famous and shamed the Texas jail system to no end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did I mention this really happened?Skipping blithely between comedy and drama, the film has some clever sequences and great scams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthrough no fault of their own, I never bought that Carrey and McGregor were lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not out of anyfear from them about getting physical; they just don't have any spark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without that passion, nothing really matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the film does have some very fun moments, including mockeries of golf and Texas that won't be forgotten any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAD MEN SEASON FOUR ($49.98; Lionsgate) -- For some reason, studios delay putting out season boxed sets until right before the next season begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That, of course, gives new fans very little time toplunge into a show and get up to speed so they can watch the new season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also gives current fans verylittle time to reacquaint themselves with what happened previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the UK, they get the season boxedsets out as soon as the current run is over, giving fans the maximum amount of time to commit to ashow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in the US? You get Treme a few weeks before the new season starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you get Mad Men a few weeks before they THOUGHT the new season would start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But because negotiations hit some snags,the fifth season of Mad Men won't be airing until March of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So we unexpectedly get a chance to deal with Season Four almost a year before the new one begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Me, I've long found the show flawed bythinking it should be a Peyton Place-style melodrama and dread all flashbacks to Don Draper'schildhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whenever an episode actually focuses on work (like the classic all-nighter pulled by Don andPeggy in episode 7 "The Suitcase") the show comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But whatever its shortcomings, the excellentcast keeps me coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The regular DVD packaging, by the way, is notably chintzy and awkward todeal with.WHO'S THE CABOOSE? ($19.95; Flatiron/New Video) -- This mockumentary spoofs the pilot season when actors scramble to get cast in one of the dozens and dozens of sitcoms and dramas that get to shoot an initial episode and hope they get picked up by a network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's mainly a testament to how smart youngtalent often surrounds themselves -- or simply becomes friends with -- other talented people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence, thismovie stars Sarah Silverman and also features about-to-be-ready-for-primetime talent like David Cross,Andy Dick, Kathy Griffin and H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Benhjamin in a story co-written, directed and starring Sam Seder ofHome Movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DENNIS THE MENACE SEASON ONE ($29.93; Shout) -- It's easy to see why this mild sitcom was such an instant hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dennis was a lovable but frustrating kid who got into wholesome scrapes (breaking a vase, letting a dog get loose, "helping' his neighbor Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson) that frustrated everyone around him.That was literally it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one ever changed or grew, nothing ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every week Dennis wouldinnocently create some mishap and his parents would hold their heads and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson would shake hisfist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It made the series a Top 20 hit for three seasons, until even fans grew tired of the repetitiveness andit quickly faded away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for fans of the scamp Jay North, Shout delivers all 32 episodes of season one ingood shape and at a very reasonable price, along with some extras like a cross-over episode with The Donna Reed Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of the comic should definitely check out Hank Ketcham's collected works, lovingly presented by Fantagraphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jokes are just as familiar but his draftsmanship lifts it to highart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES COLLECTION ($129.98 BluRay; MPI) -- This collection presents all 14 of the Basil Rathbone films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twelve of them were beautifully restored by the UCLA Flm &amp;Television Archive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first and best movies -- The Hounds Of The Baskervilles and The Adventures of'The Hangover 2' Trailers: New TV Spots...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Cruise To Play Cheating Politician In... 'The Greatest Movie Ever Sold': Morgan Spurlock...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsay Lohan Quickly Released From Jail After...Sherlock Holmes , both from 1939 -- were NOT remastered but look fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's definitely a case of diminishing returns but Rathbone and Nigel Bruce put their indelible stamps on these roles and it's a pleasure to have all 14 in one compact collection that takes up the space of a single standard DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extrasinclude six audio commentaries by scholars (including one new one) and film footage of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still get a thrill out of knowing I'm probably enjoying a better print and image at home on my plasma tv than most fans saw in movie theaters some 70 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ALAN BENNETT COLLECTION ($54.98; BBC/2Entertain) -- Here's a long-overdue set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alan Bennett is a beloved figure in the UK with no equivalent I can think of in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was a groundbreaking comic in his youth, became a major dramatist, delivered sterling work on radio and, asan aside, one of the most popular chroniclers of British life via his memoirs and other pieces both writtenand performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also produced brilliant television and this set covers some of his best, including theacclaimed but long unavailable movie An Englishman Abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That story of a disgraced British spy forthe Soviets living in Moscow wasn't the masterpiece I hoped for but certainly worth seeing, as iseverything here, which features sterling talent like Danie Day Lewis, Alan Bates, Janet McTeer and manyothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if we could only get a complete set of his TV masterpiece Talking Heads I could rest easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does notguarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover eachweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does notobligate him in any way to speak positively or negatively of their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sponsored Links SHOCKING: 46" LCD TVs for $54.09 Today ONLY: Unique site sells 46" LCD TVs for up to 98% off retail price.Comments 9 Pending Comments 0View FAQ 157 Fans 78 Fans 115 Fans Buy a link here SmartStyleLiving.com Mom Is 55, Looks 30...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her clever $5 wrinkle therapy angers Botox Doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Find Out How!

If he was worried a genuine candidate might get blocked by his siphoning off votes, couldn't he have said so? If it was for the 'free pass," I say, really? Not when he was having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was completely inexplicab le to me, no matter what the real guy did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part One:LOL! Don't worry about it, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am a New Orleanian, and I don't understandan America that could leave one of their own cities to rot for years after beingdestroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you see, we are equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway, let me try to answer you questions, 1,) A wonderful place for doing NOTHING??? Is enjoying the moments of your life nothing? In the end, those moments are all you have and to do it right takesenergy, presence and creativity .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would say that is more than nothing. 2,) You say that "Treme" is not good story telling, even if it is telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I lived Katrinaand the years afterwards and it is epic story telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the story of struggle,abandonmen t and bravery in the face of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is the truth and I think David Simon has done it justice. 3,)Those street musicians are outsiders, but, anyway, money is not the great motivator in the culture of New Orleans, It used to be the enjoyment of the life of the city and in family, but Katrina added the insistance onthe survival of the culture itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We have seen what life is like without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That isnot an option for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part Two: And finally 4,) Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOL! I really laughed at this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am part of a blog called "Back of Town".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It involves mostly a group of bloggers that fought for the city post Katrina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The John Goodman character is particiall y based on one of them, Anyway, they had a poll early on on the characters , Davis had 4% approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I voted for him! That is another characteri zation of New Orleanians .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We like our characters ! They provide the entertainm ent in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Davis is harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy his antics, He is the smile in the theater masks of Thalia and Melpomene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See you next season! (Well,in your case, maybe not.) I hope you make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look, I have yet to see "Treme".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm just too busy living that wonderful South-of-I - 10 Luzianna life to watch that much TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I gotta clean up the kitchen after making curry cream butternut squash and coconut milk soup and and backyard lettuce salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week we had fresh Pontchartr ain flounder fillets with homemade Hollandais e and a Spanish Tarragon garnish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We caught the flounder and grew the tarragon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I gotta get up mighty early to trollthe Trestles for specs and flounder before the wind kicks up whitecaps on big Lake Pontchartr ain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's just fishing and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't even indulge in music andMichael Giltz 03:33 PM on 4/10/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER doctorj2u 11:03 PM on 4/10/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER doctorj2u 11:05 PM on 4/10/2011 Permalink | Share it luziannagirl 15 minutes ago (9:49 PM)295 Fans 78 Fansnightlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I will get around to renting Treme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eventually .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a former New Orleanian, my guess as to why N.O. characters seem indifferen t to success is that at the end of the day, they calculate success differentl y than the rest of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just ain't all about money, folks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There truly are some things money ---well lots of it anyway---j ust can't buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Life in South Louisiana is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Must agree with you on Dudley Moore's Arthur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Haven't seen it in years and now can't wait to get my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disagree on Treme and Black Swan.They are both marvelous.I love the total unpredicta bility of Treme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Real life does just start and stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Melissa Leo is doing some of her best and yet most understate d work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's almost hard to imagine she's the same woman who won an Oscar for the Fighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black Swan is a Horror masterpiec e pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They come very few and far between.I've never heard of Alan Bennett.Must find out more.Thanks again MG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly Treme is intelligen tly made with a great cast; glad you're enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buy a link here Sponsored Links SHOCKING: 46" LCD TVs for $54.09 Today ONLY: Unique site sells 46" LCD TVs for up to 98% off retail price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SmartStyleLiving.com ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA COMEDY MUSIC TV CELEBRITY KIDS MOVIEFONE Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it NHBill 01:14 AM on 4/08/2011 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:29 PM on 4/08/2011 Permalink | Share it Get AlertsFRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCAL</p>
