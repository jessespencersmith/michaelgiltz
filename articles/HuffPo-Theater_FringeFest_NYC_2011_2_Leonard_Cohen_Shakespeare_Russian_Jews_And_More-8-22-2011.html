"Dance Me To The End Of Love" is a good example of what they do: FOLLOW USSeptember 15, 2011 Signs Your Husband Is GayKirstie Alley Walks NYFW The Alexander Wang PartyKnightley Gets Dangerous EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like 43 Posted: 8/22/11 07:04 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES CONNECT FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT TECH MEDIA LIFE &amp; STYLE CULTURE COMEDY HEALTHY LIVING WOMEN LOCAL MORE Like 40KTelevision Mad Men Jersey Shore Scarlett Johansson Smarter Ideas More Log inCohen's version is stately where Hughes makes the song slinkily sexual if not downright lascivious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I first fell in love with Leonard Cohen's music thanks to the Jennifer Warnes tribute album Famous BlueRaincoat, which definitely leaned towards the pop/folk side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If and when Hughes hopefully records her show, that album will be an excellent complement to the Warnes classic, showing what other directionshis music can go in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't think of higher praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is Ali Hughes performing "Dance Me To The End Of Love" as Ali &amp; The Thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROMEO &amp; JULIET: CHOOSE YOUR OWN ENDING ** out of **** This goof on Romeo &amp; Juliet by the Impressionable Players is unsatisfied with a play where Romeo begins by declaring his undying love for Rosaline but soon switches gears and insists he really loves Juliet, not to mention that downer of an ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence this modest comedy by brother and sister teamAnn and Shawn Fraistat, with Ann also directing the six member cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At various stages, the play stopsand the audience votes on what happens next: go for Juliet or swerve back to Rosaline, live happily everafter or die miserably, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game cast mugs their way through the proceedings, with JamesWaters ably providing the calm center of the storm as Romeo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest are appropriately shameless intheir desire to elicit laughs but the thin material gives them precious little to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RACHEL CALOF ** 1/2 out of **** This is an intelligently made, well-acted one-woman show about the life of a Russian Jewish immigrant who travels alone to America at the turn of the century and finds herself in North Dakota in a tiny shack,cheek by jowl with a new husband and his pushy relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a drama with music, for Rachel's story ispunctuated at times by song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kate Fuglei plays Rachel Calof, tackling the tricky accent and songs with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She shines especially on the early numbers "Lullabye -- Beyond The Last Hill" and the show'shigh point "America," which captures the frightening thrill of heading to a new life and a new continent.Later songs -- by Leslie Steinweiss -- don't always reach that high standard and Fuglei's voice sometimesventures into classical territory that seems less natural for Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The script by Ken LaZebnik touches onall the expected moments: Rachel being overwhelmed first by the city and then by the wide open prairies,a cantankerous (if not worse) mother in law, a husband who stands up for other people's rights as a union activist but doesn't defend his own wife and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Ellen S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pressman subtly moves things along but still the 80 minutes feels long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because Rachel's story is essentially a static one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shejourneys thousands of miles but we meet her at the start as a smart, reserved, stoic but likable womanand that's what she is at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other characters are presented vividly but they too don't evolvemuch if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the evening is worth it to see an actress invest so fully and successfully in a character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOOKS ON TAPE ** 1/2 out of **** It's no surprise that a fringe festival would be populated by works-in-progress, shows that are happy to be mounted and give the playwright a sense of exactly what they've got and what needs to change for theshow to go to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So finding a play that feels fully formed is a welcome relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Books OnTape department of a Barnes &amp; Noble in New York City is the unlikely meeting spot for a string of would-be lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adriane (played by the actress Jake Lipman) is an audiobook nut who not only devours books MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

(This is what they stop in order totell us what the play was about.) But if the show couldn't afford a spacesuit, why not change the dialogueto fit their period costumes, rather than having them dressed in bodice-ripping medieval garb whilespouting lines about NASA and mission control? WHAT THE SPARROW SAID ** 1/2 out of **** This play is confused and disorderly, well-acted and intriguing, messy and -- scene by scene -- carefully constructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's clearly the work of a young playwright bursting with talent but who hasn't found theirvoice yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That playwright is Danny Mitarotondo of The Common Tongue theater company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the story of two brothers, though it was a while before I realized the two leads were in fact brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One is in LosAngeles taking care of their dying mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other is in New York checking out the lavish apartmentunexpectedly left to him by a customer he waited on but barely knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brother in New York travels toLA -- not without adventures -- and they have a combative, air-clearing meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One or both of them mayalso have a stutter or Tourette's; I can't be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a serious play with one scene highly naturalistic, thenext clumsily having two actions take place at the same time, another scene vaguely absurdist and so on.But moment to moment, there is an intelligence about What The Sparrow Said that kept me engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scene with one brother (Matthew Michael Hurley, especially appealing) giving a lift to an elderly woman and then dropping her off at a reunion by the river was oddly moving and gives a sense of Mitarodondo's ability to creative vivid characters with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actors are wholly committed throughoutfrom Kevin Mannering giving his all as the over-the-top Blaze to Ruby Ruiz in the sketchy role of Nursie.It's not a satisfying work at this stage, by any stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for whatMitarodondo does next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PAPER CUT *** out of **** This one-woman show is fresh and clever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish it had more emotional punch to make it truly great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is a smart conceit that makes the most of the offbeat premise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essentially, we see a secretary sittingat her desk, pining for the unseen boss who gives her impossible commands that she (usually) deliverswith aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Played with the sexy reserve of a Hollywood librarian by Yael Rasooly -- you know, the sortof woman who takes off her glasses and lets down her hair and is suddenly vampy -- this secretary getscaught up in a fantasy world of romance and intrigue that is enacted onstage with Rasooly seated at herdesk and playing with paper cut-outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's silly fun, catnip for movie buffs especially as they mockHollywood conventions from the lion's roar of MGM at the beginning to the fade out at end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rasooly co-wrote and directed this import from Israel that proves an active imagination a la Walter Mitty and a loveof movies is universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The high point is a clever combination of show tunes that Rasooly belts out quitewell, each one frantically dissolving into the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show itself is 50 minutes long, which is just about the right length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's certainly nothing else like it at the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wonder if they'll tell another tale this way or whether this was a one-shot conceit? I imagine the latter but never underestimate the powerof puppetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check out this video to get a good idea of Rasooly does but be forewarned: it covers theentire story so spoilers are rife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like what you see, stop the video and head to the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's acharmer in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 12 Halle Berry's Flawless Bikini Bod Olsen Sister Flashes HerBra Scarlett's naked pics, TylerPerry is highest paid MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Entertainment News at THR.com More Celebrity News at People.comScarlett JohanssonBecomes A Twitter Trending Topic Mark Ballas and Pia Toscano Split READ MORE America's Got Talent Picksa Winner READ MORE Michaele Salahi Was NotKidnapped as Husband Claimed READ MORE Anna Faris On Her Boob Job &amp; Bulls*it Women Actress Friends Getting Back To Her Roots?
