(Does he think Yolanda Adams or Tonex would haveflamed out this early? Really?) And plenty of singers on the show have brought a gospel flair to various performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a lot more singers have brought an undisciplined indulgence via endless runs and trills and acrobatic vocalizing they associate with the church or with Mariah Carey but which have nothing to MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Playboy | Movies | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 37 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Comments (2,638) WATCH: Demi Moore In A Teeny Bikini Comments (402) Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Comments (573) Lindsay Garvey iPhone Alarm Glitch: How It Cost Me My Job Comments (912) Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Comments (133) Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Comments (33) WATCH: Ashton &amp; Natalie Get Naked, Have Sex In New Movie Comments (197) Two House Republicans Violate Constitution With Voting Blunder Comments (8,860) BECK IN TROUBLE?

" I wonder if one of those was Lilly Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I heard her sing, I thought she was dreadful: thebottom end disappeare d and it sounded almost like she was talking instead of singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the judges said it was amazing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time I wondered if she was holding the mike too farfrom her mouth, and maybe the judges could hear more live than we could at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway I wondered if anyone else noticed this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't written that yet in my main comments but when Kara isn't goofing around, I do think she's become a stronger judge as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And randy early on was very focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyseem to be stepping up their game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it'll take a season for Ellen to settle in and notfeel like the new kid on the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll bet Simon did think they over-prais ed Lilly's singing a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the opposite is true from what you suggest: as they pointed out, on set the band islouder and can support the singer more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The viewers at home hear a mix where the vocalsare much more prominent and up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes it sounds like the band is in the nextroom.So we're hearing their vocals more nakedly than the judges do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This season is a train wreck . . . agree with the poster who says the bar was set so high byLambert, that nothing can compare . . . think of all the real talent that has emerged over the pastseasons . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Hudson, Carrie Underwood, , etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This season's pool of singers is the weakest I have ever seen . . . and none are in the ballpark of some of these past contestant s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Simon has checked out and the magic has been lost . . . predicting this may be the last season of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's interestin g is that the thought never crossed Jermaine's mind that God might be smiting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter what happens, God did it, and it is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such an interestin g phenomenon , this religious faith is. agreed. if he had done well it would have been gawd's will. if he failed it was gawd's will. this way he avoids any responsibi lity or introspect ion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor Haeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She seemed like a very long shot during auditions, but had a cute way about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus she had a country connection , which she promptly lost once she reached Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also "grew" a lot of hair, which I assume were extensions .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Hollywood, she became just another contestant - her uniqueness was erased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wonder who advised her of that? Mom? Plus, and it has to be said, her lisp did nothing to add to her singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the depth of how young and how badly she sings wasn't truly realized until she was chosen forFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 08:12 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it beatrix 05:01 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER StephenDedalus82 04:32 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER goodgravy 06:33 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it Charity 03:25 PM on 3/05/2010 59 Fans 470 Fans 59 Fans 39 Fans Follow 43 Fans 59 Fansthe top 24, and frankly, last night I switched the channel as she was singing her good by number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're right - she should have never gone this far.As for Delamor, she should have stayed a bit longer, but was never going to make it to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was shocked that Garcia was in the final bottom - he's one of the better boy singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's hope hesteps up his game next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go Crystal! I don't think they characteri zed the pairings as the bottom two (or four).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes the producers get tricky and put someone in that bottom two that hasn't necessaril y received the second lowest votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Andrew might have been put there for dramatic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless Ryan specifical ly says they both have the lowest vote totals that week, I don't think you can assume anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Didi will surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could be right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know producer Steve Lillywhite agrees with you. i have been a big fan of AI since the fantasia season (2003-04). i don't know if i am just burnt outon the show or if this year is spectacula rly under par. i program the show on DVR and, honestly, i have zipped through it in 20 minutes. i think i am watching only out of loyalty and if the singers don'tstep it up SOON i fear i may not be completing the season. i wonder if other AI fans feel this or if itis just me. i think adam lambert raised the bar so high that no one this year can get close to bringing the kind of excitement to the competitio n that he did. listen to the judges comments. they all but say 'we want you to choose a song and bring your own twist to it, just like adam did." and then when thecontestant s mix it up they get shot down...'yo u changed it up too much.' Agree with the eliminatio n choices but not your verdict on bringing Gawd into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes an incredible amount of hubris and self-delus ion to believe that Gawd "has a plan" for every person on the planet, or has so little on His mind that he is obsessed with what happens to little self-absor bed Jermaine today or any other day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, if that is true, perhaps Jermaine should assume (while he's at it) that Gawd HAS heard his church singing, and is doing his best to convince him he should find another line of work.Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 08:14 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER MaryscottOConnor 03:07 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 08:15 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER goodgravy 01:34 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 01:04 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:29 PM on 3/05/201043 Fans 77 Fans 7 Fans 11 Fans 24 FansIn general, I agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God does NOT care who wins Idol or he World Series or your high school basketball game or the Academy Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing could be further from the truthfor a true Christian than believing God wants fame and glory for you (even if you imagineit's to give you a bigger platform to praise Him).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, I was just trying to think ofsomething polite to say about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I try not to forget that these people like Jermaine andHaeley Vaughn are just regular people who've never been on local TV before and aresuddenly on national TV and being examined under a microscope .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you know, I'll trash his performanc e and defense of it (it's church singing!) but if I can say something nice as they walk out the door, why not? Fair enough, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would try and find the positive with most of these kids andcould easily do so with the other three eliminated , regardless of their performanc e difficulti es.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, Jermaine always displayed more arrogance than humility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He felt the need to answer back to every bit of constructi ve criticism offered him, challenged Simon to "come hear me in church" and generally acted like he was the second coming of John Legend, as if the judges were just too dense to realize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having said that, I think this contest is more of a psychologi cal endurance event than a singing competitio n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How these kids maintain their sanity when criticized one week for not making the song their own, then criticized the next week for not respecting the original melody is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All I think Haeley's performanc e last week was vivid and showed her talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This week trying to follow the bogus advice she received last week to choose something young which is such a general vaguefeedback they habitually give to anyone younger than 18 led her to attempt a shallow white girl poptune was doomed, and there was nothing left to sparkle through the performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least Simon acknowledg ed its tough because they give such contradict ory advice, especially from one week to the next, in their attempt to encourage the performers to find their own way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is especially frustrating to me when they tell one kid to get out of his comfort zone, and then the next to stick to whatthey're good at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? No, she just sang it poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she had even a decent voice and some musicality she couldhave made it work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's really not a very complicate d song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This show has lost its 'sizzle" also, 90% of the judges comments for several seasons have been'you chose the wrong song".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't fault the talent but the producers and judges for this, regardlessof talent if you choose the right song you will win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its time has come and gone! I agree and also wonder WTF about the vocal coaches? Why don't they do a better job ofguiding the contestant s to the best songs for their voice and style? It seems like the vocal coaches don't do a good job because "you picked the wrong song" is the constant refrainPermalink | Share it filmex 01:57 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it seerickson 12:40 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it pangursperson 09:11 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it Thumbody 12:11 PM on 3/05/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER mlrlmsw 06:00 PM on 3/05/20107 Fans 177 Fans 21 Fans Follow 51 Fansfrom the judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, Randy - "pitchy" is all he can say...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think they're instructed not to influence song choices at all, precisely because song choice is considered a measure of their, dare i say it, artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've noticed that Randy only complains about the singer being pitchy when they are sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seems to love it when they are flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well. ...wrong song, too old for you, too big a song for you....pitchy, all over the place, a mess Same old, same old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZ That was one loooong hour last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Danny has discovered cocaine and Ryan and the judges are on Valium!
