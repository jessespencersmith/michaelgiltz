It stands firmly in the shadow of Sondheim, obviously indebted but never finding its own voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One can easily understand the impact it had when the one act March Of The Falsettos debuted in the Reagan era: a play about a married man who leaves his wife for his gay lover, only to see his wife and therapist get together and somehow they all work together to raise his son? Its mere existence was surely exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Falsettoland sadly updated their story, this time with the inevitable spectre of AIDS pushing its way in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, the subject matter alone thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, time has not been kind to Falsettos .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My guest who saw the original insisted that the bar has been lowered so much for Broadway musicals that he‚Äôd argue this show now seems a damn sight better than it did back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can‚Äôt say, but I do know that the characters barely register as more than archetypes ‚Äî the lesbians next door are barely more than just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our protagonists Marvin and his new love Whizzer feed off arguing but I have to be told this, not shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marvin‚Äôs ex-wife insists she should hate Whizzer but just can‚Äôt and again we have to be told that since we have barely seen them together and can‚Äôt imagine why she can‚Äôt dislike him anyway. (There‚Äôs nothing irresistible about this guy, especially to his ex-wife.) When Marvin‚Äôs son wants to ask Whizzer if he should go to a therapist, we are a little surprised since they haven‚Äôt said boo to one another yet, much less given us the idea that the kid likes him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it has a shaky revival, with actors that mostly seem far from ideal for their roles, a set that has one strong idea and then abandons it and an overall color scheme that puts you to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christian Borle stars as Marvin, the apparently selfish man who has left his wife for his lover and kind of drives everyone around him nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He feels tamped down and unspecific, a tad unusual for an actor who usually fills up the stage with ease and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whizzer is played by Andrew Rennels, the appealing star of The Book Of Mormon .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whizzer is meant to be infuriatingly charming, the sort of man who finds monogamy tiresome until he suddenly finds himself in love with a man who is deeply involved with his ex-wife and son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I take it Whizzer is meant to be a boy toy with a mind of his own, but I couldn‚Äôt really get a handle on him ‚Äî is Marvin driving him away, is Whizzer just not ready to settle down, is he selfish himself or merely young? Stephanie J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Block is the ex-wife with low self-esteem and she comes off best ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Breaking Down‚Äù is clearly the show‚Äôs highlight and Brock does her level best, though it always seems more like the idea of a show-stopping comic number rather than the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Little of the action makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone is desperate for the son Jason (a fine Anthony Rosenthal) to see a therapist, though I‚Äôm not quite sure why. (Because he prefers playing chess to playing baseball? Then I need therapy too.) And Act Two has the very unfortunate effect of playing today as cliche by insisting that dying can ennoble everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least the songs got a little stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act One has almost nothing of note beyond ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Breaking Down,‚Äù with ‚ÄúMarch Of the Falsettos‚Äù almost bizarrely odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But act two boasts of several tunes that are strong melodically and pretty memorable, including the kid‚Äôs ‚ÄúMiracle of Judaism,‚Äù Marvin‚Äôs love song ‚ÄúWhat More Can I Say?‚Äù and the amusing tune ‚ÄúThe Baseball Game‚Äù (‚Äùwe‚Äôre watching Jewish kids who can‚Äôt play baseball play baseball‚Äù) far and away the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One can see here the talent of Finn developing towards his big hit The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set by David Rockwell is fitfully bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act one begins with a big grey cube that actors slowly pull apart, moving the pieces here and there to form a table or couch or chairs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine, these folks are building their lives, creating a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It didn‚Äôt overwhelm but it didn‚Äôt distract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the combination of the sets (including rather mundane backdrops that modestly raise and lower a NYC skyline) and lighting and costumes is dull and grey to a fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it felt abandoned in act two, where a more permanent home set and hospital room bed pushed aside the grey cube conceit for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely a better case could be made for this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing can change lyrics that strain to rhyme and stop you dead in your tracks time and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was noble and ground-breaking and intellectually inclined and that‚Äôs more than most musicals can say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it will have to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2016 Employee Of The Year (Under The Radar at Public) *** Germinal (Under The Radar At Public) *** 1/2 Fiddler On The Roof 2015 Broadway revival with Danny Burstein ** 1/2 Skeleton Crew *** Noises Off (2016 Broadway revival) ** but *** if you‚Äôve never seen it before The Grand Paradise *** Our Mother‚Äôs Brief Affair * 1/2 Something Rotten *** Sense &amp; Sensibility (Bedlam revival) *** 1/2 Broadway &amp; The Bard * 1/2 Prodigal Son ** A Bronx Tale: The Musical ** Buried Child (2016 revival w Ed Harris) ** Nice Fish *** Broadway By The Year: The 1930s at Town Hall *** Hughie ** Pericles (w Christian Camargo) * 1/2 Straight ** 1/2 Eclipsed *** Red Speedo *** The Royale ** 1/2 Boy **** The Robber Bridegroom *** Hold On To Me, Darling *** Blackbird ** 1/2 Disaster! * The Effect ** 1/2 Dry Powder ** 1/2 Head Of Passes ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year: The 1950s *** 1/2 The Crucible (w Ben Whishaw) *** Bright Star ** She Loves Me (w Laura Benanti) *** Antlia Pneumatica ** 1/2 RSC at BAM: Richard II (w David Tennant) ** 1/2 RSC at BAM: Henry IV Part I and II (w Antony Sher) *** RSC at BAM Henry V (w Alex Hassell) ** 1/2 Nathan The Wise ** 1/2 The Father ** American Psycho ** Waitress ** 1/2 Fully Committed ** 1/2 Long Day‚Äôs Journey Into Night *** A Streetcar Named Desire (w Gillian Anderson) *** Tuck Everlasting ** War ** Paramour * 1/2 Troilus &amp; Cressida (Shakespeare in the Park) ** 1/2 Cats (on Broadway, 2016 revival) ** The Encounter (Complicite on Broadway) ** Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom (at Two River Theater) *** Oh, Hello ** 1/2 Heisenberg ** 1/2 The Dudleys ** 1/2 Holiday Inn * 1/2 A Life ** 1/2 Love Love Love ** 1/2 The Radicalization Of Rolfe (FringeFest NYC) ** 1/2 Sweat * 1/2 The Death of The Last Black Man In The Whole Entire World aka The Negro Book Of The Dead *** Falsettos ** _____________Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of the forthcoming website BookFilter, a book lover‚Äôs best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trying to decide what to read next?
