(Don't you DARE help apoor, black woman get health planning that involves areference to condoms as protection against disease andpregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, sure, give her a little soup and afundamentalist sermon to go with it.)Also, stop getting so uptight over the Confederate flag, stopmoaning about the policemen gunned down by criminals withonce-illegal Uzis (and give their widows a Bible to comfortthem, I suppose), don't worry if those Uzis get into the handsof terrorists, and if a Supreme Court nominee of Bush's mightset the Court back ten years, don't put up a fuss becausepeople will claim you're an obstructionist.Is all of that idiotic or is it just me?Supporting our police is a winning stance with mainstreamAmerica. (And every police organization in the country isfurious that Bush is letting those automatic weapons get backon the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every time a cop or innocent person is killed --press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not taking cynical advantage of thesituation -- that's standing up for our men and women in blue.)Ignoring the spread of the Confederate Flag -- which causesSouthern states business and is deeply offensive to our core --is sure to dismay black voters, one of the few dependablegroups the Dems can claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They already feel slighted andtaken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine if the Dems told them objecting toa racist symbol that only appears on most state flags becausethe Southerners objected to desegregating schools was a wasteof time.Objecting to government funds going to Moonies,Scientologists, Falun Gong and other minor religions or cultswould play well for traditional Dems, fundamentalist Christiansand many others. (Lots of major religions are leery of gov'tfunding propping them up.)
