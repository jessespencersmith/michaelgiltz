                <p>MUSIC Tflver The gay bassist for one of the seminal rock groups of the'70s and '80s once feared where his sexuality would take him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, with his new autobiography, The Grand lllusion, Chuck Panozzo is finally on solid ground By Michael Giltz e's been playing in bands for more than 45 years, but it's only recently that Styx bassist Chuck Panozzo has learned to enjoy the basic perks ofbeing a rock star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For instance, when he sees girls in the audience pleading for a guitar pick, Panozzo will single out the one with the cutest bol&amp;iend, point to him, and bounce a pick offthe guy's chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In imitation of bandmates who drape the bras and panties thrown onto the stage over their instruments, Panozzo re- cently taped a frat boy's boxer shorts to his bass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guitarist Tommy Shaw respond- ed to the usually resewed Panozzo,'\o,t know, that's one of the most joyous mo- ments I've ever experienced with you." I1/s been a long time coming, according to the trials and tribulations Panozzo lays out in his new memoir, The Grand lllu- sion: Loue, Lies, and My Life With Styx, in which the rocker details his lifelong strug- gle with being gay; the founding of Styx with his twin brother, Johr; publicly com- ing out in 2001; performing at the Gay Games last year; and living with AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along the way, he's put an end to one or two rock and roll traditions."I've stopped autographing female breasts," says Panozzo. "This one girl lift- ed up her top and said, WiII you sign my chest?' I said, 'If you give me a piece of paper, I'd really prefer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if your bo1'friend has a really cute ass, I'll auto- graph his butt."' Actually, Panozzo didn't say that last Iine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's far too well-mannered for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, his life story is more about missed opportunities than rock and roll debauchery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point out all the lascivious- ness a gay rock star could have indulged in during the '70s, and Panozzo responds, 'You want to hear me cry?" Styx was one of the biggest acts of the '70s and early'80s, delivering a string of hit songs like "Lady," "Babe," and "Come Sail Away" as well as four consecutive multiplatinum albums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The band, whose progenitor was formed by Chuck and John at age 12, g::aduated from playing weddings and the occasional after-school gig to sold-out stadium concerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its iconic pop culture status continues to be rein- forced with references to the band on shows as hip and influential as The Simp- sons and Arrested Deuelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam Sandler is said to be a huge fan, and "Come Sail Away" anchored the pilot ofFrecths and Geehs, one of the most ac- claimed television shows ofrecent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking from his home in south Flori- da, where he lives with his partner, Tim, Panozzo fondly recalls the first time he re- alized he liked boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was 9 years old, Iiving in his hometown of Chicago, and hadjust returned to Catholic school after breaking his leg. "I'm sitting in school, and there's a nun who-not to disparage the sisters-says in her very deepest voice, 'Charles! We're having a fire drill today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's going to be an eighth-grade boy who's going to carry you out,"'remembers Panozzo. "All of a sudden I could see this guy walking up, and I thought, Gee, that uni- form loohs hind of nice on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was very cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IfI could have picked the guy to carry me out, it would have been him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said, 'I'm going to pick you up, and I want you to grab me by the neck so I don't drop you.' I said, 'OK.' So after the drill was over, he dropped me back into my chair and the nun said,'Charles, how did that go?' I said, 'Sister, are we going to have another fire drill tomorrow?"' That was about as bold as Partozzo got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Styx was always an unusually straitlaced bald; even its manager and executives )&gt; 52 | May 22, 2OO7 a0vocale c0m THE ADVOCATEMUSIC at a couple ofits record labels thought its members were pretty uncool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the time the band hit it big, many of the members were married or in serious relationships And with Panozzo not even remotely in- terested in the groupies, he jokes, Styx had the luckiest roadies in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it came to being gay, Panozzo was equally reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His father died when he was 24, and,Panozzo and his mother never really discussed the subject He began attending a seminary high school, designed to give boys early prepa- ration for the priesthood, when he was a sophomore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One fondly remembered mo- ment of erotic sublimation involved Panozzo and the other boys dancing with each other to a rock and roll song playing on a smuggled-in radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He left the seminary a year later and rejoined the band, which was enjoying some local success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he was 20 years old Panozzo got up the nerve to go to a gay porn theater for the first time. "One time the police came running in," he says. "There were 12 of them-almost as many of them as there were of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't do the Pee-wee Herman thing or the George Michael thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in those days they would take your name and put it in the paper; all they had to do was find just one Buy [unclothed].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as they left, they just mocked us. lMhat the fuck are you guys watching here?'They neverasked for IDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just turned up the lights, they yelled, and then they left." Despite his fears, Panozzo was deter- mined not to be cowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He came out to his brother and sister before he had so much as kissed a man, while his sexuality was more or less an open secret with his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his early 20s he finally went on a few tenta- tive dates, secure in the beliefthat most gay men didn't pay any attention to rock and roll and wouldn't know who he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the band's success grew, Panozzo would discreetly go out to gay bars while on tour and was almost never recognized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His frrst serious relationship ended be- cause, Panozzo says, he simply wasn't ready to be open and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He even went so far as to introduce his boyfriend as a "friend" at a function he was hosting for then-Chicago mayor Jane B5rrne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the radio, Styx had a number t hit with "Babe," and the group transformed from opening act to headliner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Panozzo used his Catholic school training to avoid lascivious thoughts. "There's a phrase in the Catholic Church they use for the nuns: custody of the eyes," says Panozzo, referring to the idea that nuns are to avoid looking at their naked bodies to help avoid impure thoughts. "For a long time eye contact was an issue for me How can I entertain these peopl.e uthen I'm afraid to knh at them?" He also avoided eye contact with hisbandmates in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panozzo ignored his own issues by focusing on his brother John-who fought addiction for much of his life and died in 1996-and the needs of his aging mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When guitarist James Young (a.k.a.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JY) asked him in the '70s if he was gay, Panozzo angrily denied it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But life caught up with him in 1991, when he was diag- nosed as HIV-positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He developed AIDS in late '98, frghting illness as the band recorded 1999's Braue New World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eventually, Tommy Shaw asked Panoz- zo in an e-mail if he was sick, andPanozzo finally told the group everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone was supportive about his being gay----even keyboardist Dennis DeYoung, whose bat- tles with bandmates fueled enough tales to fill a dozen episodes of VH1's Behind the Music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Panozzo was too weak to record his bass parts for the album (for which he'd participated in all of the re- hearsals), DeYoung wanted Panozzo's name removed from the credits. "It was like a punch in the face," admits Panozzo, who managed to contribute to several tracks in the end. "In aII reality, [DeYoung] might have been right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But [we're talking] about someone who, when you're 12 years old, cornes down and says, 'Can I play with you?' with an accordion under his arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We weren't always the rock gods we were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knew I'd lost a brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knew my mother had passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knew I was on very shaky ground here. "Where's the man who could write all these beautiful songs about'Lady' and 'Babe'? Where is his heart at? Arld I really began to question what our friendship and relationship was based on." Today, DeYoung no longer performs with the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panozzo, thriving on his current anti-HIV medication regimen, joins Styx often on the road and is looser and happier onstage than he's ever been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He speaks to gay groups whenever possi- ble and is politically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his bud- dies still have some learning to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panoz- zo says the band's longtime manager gets antsy sometimes when he has gay visitors backstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And his bandmates have yet to act on their promise to do a benefit show for AIDS research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once too shy even to kiss another guy, Panozzo now confidently says, "I'll make it happen."
