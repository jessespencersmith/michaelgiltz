You can't help rooting forMargaret (Frances McDormand, in fine form).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a single mom in the poor neighborhood of South Boston with a special needs kid, struggling to get by whenshe's fired from the Dollar Store for being perpetually late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why is she late? Because she can't afforddecent daycare and has to wait for her landlady to show up before Margaret can take off for her low- paying job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the latest in a string of jobs she's held down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one of the show's more effective moments, Margaret details the tenuous hold she has on surviving by showing how taking a bite of some hard candy leads to a chipped tooth which leads to a dentistappointment (delayed for six months until she can't bear it any longer -- by then of course, it's infected MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 9/11 Responders Warned They Will Be Screened For Terrorism Ties (EXCLUSIVE) Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump Rip Each Other In Heated Political War Of Words PlayStation Network Could Be Down For Days FOLLOW USBIG NEWS: Celebrities | Britney Spears | LeAnn Rimes | Lindsay Lohan | Royal Wedding | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS: The Funniest People Not On TwitterMiranda Kerr &amp; Orlando Bloom Step Out To 'The The Funniest Someecards For Easter 2011Weekly Roundup of eBay Vintage Clothing Finds News Web Like 276K April 24, 2011 | Log In | Sign Up Get Alerts SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Entertainment Alerts Sign UpPHOTO GALLERIES Like 20K Like 4K FRONT PAGEPOLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA TECH COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD FOOD LIVING IMPACT EDU LOCALand more expensive to fix) which leads to a late car payment which leads to no car which leads to being late to work which leads to another job down the tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is Stevie good people? Played by Patrick Carroll, he's a morose sort of guy who manages the Dollar Store.He tells Margaret he has to fire her or he'll be fired himself (she's had eight warnings about hertardiness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Margaret thinks that's b.s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What about her landlady, played with vigor by Estelle Parsons? Dottie might be eying Margaret's apartment as a crash pad for her ne'er do well son and she's always late for babysitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Dottie charges $50 a week -- which isn't exactly high -- and taking care of a special needs kid isn't exactly apiece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margaret goes along with Dottie's defense of her behavior, but maybe she can't afford tooffend the only person who will watch her kid for such a low price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's Mike (Tate Donovan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike and Margaret dated briefly in high school, but he got up and out of the South Boston neighborhood through hard work, smarts and the advantage of a dad who pushedhim to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He likes boasting about his tough childhood but certainly doesn't hang around with the old gang anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fertility doctor, Mike has a nice office in a nice neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Out of desperation, Margaret pushes her way into his workplace and asks for a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the set-up for Good People.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather predictably, every character is seen in one light and then in another -- Margaret works hard, but she might be racist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike has a black wife, but has a shameful past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stevie fires Margaret, but keeps trying to help her out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first act has some plot -- Margaretgets fired and then bullies Mike into inviting her to his birthday party so she can try and cadge a job fromone of his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the action is so minor, the conflict so minimal, you don't really feel like the playhas even begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act two has a little more zip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's mostly set in Mike's home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he calls Margaret to say the party has been canceled, she thinks he's lying and shows up anyway, setting off a showdown of sorts between Mike,his wife Kate (a solid Renee Elise Goldsberry) and Margaret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsay-Abaire is too much of a pro not toland some punches here, including some funny lines about Kate being mistaken for a nanny and Mike'sDominican secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it all boils down rather simplistically to the rich being indifferent or callous andthe poor being noble and kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gray areas it serves up simply aren't that convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margaret ispushy, but she's got a kid to feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike does volunteer work (or at least donates money and sits onboards), but he cheats on his wife and was a punk growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's hard to buy Margaret completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's blunt or rather pushy -- the sort of person who insults you, takes a little dig and then says "I'm just busting your balls," as if that makes it alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She wants to be the one who let Mike escape the neighborhood by breaking up with him and at the same time thelong-suffering martyr who pays the price for his indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McDormand creates sympathy for hersimply by the dint of her forceful, winning personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Tate Donovan's Mike simply isn't complicatedor interesting enough to serve as a foil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter what we learn about him, the play isn't about Mike andso we just don't care that much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

With this focus, the play has rarely made more sense, from Timon's behavior in the beginning (usually just annoying since the men around him are such sycophants) to his disdain for the gold that falls into hislap towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas is stronger in the first half when he's dispensing treasure and waiting forhis kindness to be returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he smartly leavens the tragedy of Timon's situation in the second halfwith humor and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.com'Bed Intruder' Star AntoineDodson Arrested Paul Reiser's New Show Yanked After Two Weeks Jerry Seinfeld, Donald Trump Rip Each Other In Heated Political War Of Words Viral Star Antoine Dodson ARRESTED Gwyneth Paltrow Is Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're All Jealous.

Musically, Todd Palmer was flawless on his clarinet solos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fox fable was told with a combination of singers and gymnastic tumbling behind a screen where their bodies created more shadow puppetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was The Nightingale that dominates the evening and your memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest was prelude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theentire second act was taken up with the tale of a fisherman who heard the sweet singing of a nightingale HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES NBA Afghanistan Fast Food Gas &amp; Oil NASA Hockey Brian Williams Gabrielle Giffords Mexico MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »so lovely that word of its beauty reached the Emperor of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had the nightingale brought to court and was so entranced by its singing he offered the bird all sorts of titles when all it really wanted was theappreciation he offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then emissaries from Japan arrived with a mechanical nightingale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peeved atthis affront to his dignity, the nightingale took off for the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not to be outdone in peevishness, theEmperor said the nightingale couldn't take off because he'd been banished from court forever.Nonetheless, when the Emperor lay dying, the nightingale returned to bewitch Death and earn the ruler a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time, the nightingale promises to sing for the Emperor every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a curious tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why exactly does the nightingale return, you wonder? But it has intrigued artists for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater have been developing a musical version of it as their follow-upto Spring Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, Lapage uses the music of Stravinsky to embrace a positively charming production filled with puppetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They range in size from a tiny boat and fisherman that traverse the canal that links the two pavilions to a giant skeletal Death that would fit right in on a Day Of the Dead parade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tiny, delicate puppets are paired off with performers who both manipulate the puppets and sing the roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The puppetry is a wonderful way to create an aura of wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combine it with the music of Stravinsky and suddenly even the simply motion of the tree branch swinging out over the canal feels like a bit of magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The singing again is solid if unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the puppetry that remains front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, there is one major exception: Olga Peretyatko as the Nightingale triumphs in the lead role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She subtlymanifests the prideful arrogance of the bird, whether it's the playful impatience she shows when waitingfor people to stop talking so she can sing or the immediate distrust the mechanical nightingale awakensin her ego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peretyatko gives the story emotional heft, an intelligent throughline and glorious singing thatturns the simple story from a delight (thanks to the deft puppetry) into a more moving experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This all-too-brief run has been a hot ticket since it was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rush to BAM by Sunday if you can or just wise up and subscribe to their seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEAUTIFUL BURNOUT ** out of **** St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse The Frantic Assembly/National Theatre of Scotland scored a major triumph when it came to St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's with Black Watch .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've just announced the show is returning (with a new cast) in April for a three week run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you missed it, don't hesitate or it might sell out again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that hit wasn't all the NTS scored: they also came up with their new show Beautiful Burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A visit to where the cast was dressing and showering exposed co-director Steven Hoggett to Gleason's Gym and the beauty and power of boxing. (Co-director and choreographer Scott Graham had been a lifelong fan.)Since movement and physicality is always central to Frantic Assembly's work, boxing was both a naturaland a huge challenge: now audiences wouldn't just comment on their work artistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The people whomattered most -- real boxers and boxing fans -- might just dismiss it as "wrong" if they didn't capturesomething essential and true about the sport while fielding a cast that could be convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a long gestation period and a lot of sparring, they've delivered this mood piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It combines the music of Underworld with a modest, overly familiar storyline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bobby (Ewan Stewart) runs a gym forserious boxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's been cultivating a couple of lads (and one lass) for a while: the "brown lad" AjayChopra (Taqi Nazeer), who is the most promising and the usual assortment of boastful kids, what passesfor intellectual among athletes, and a girl (Vicki Manderson) who demands respect even though herboxing is fueled as much by rage as by a love of the sweet science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The usual dramatics ensue: Bobby demands total and blind obedience while Ajay is a little ahead of himself and has his own ideas about the best way to box and become famous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turning pro is a tantalizingprospect that keeps them going until Ajay and Bobby butt heads once to often and Ajay leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inevitably,a showdown will occur between Bobby's chosen one and Ajay.This presents the show as much more plot-driven than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The storyline is just a wisp of a thing, an excuse really to choreograph moments on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The play is set on a large boxing ring, with a rotatingoval in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some vivid moments occur when the music explodes and the cast is onstage bobbingand weaving in unison, skipping rope, doing push-ups and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sad to say, it's not terribly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beautiful Burnout doesn't have enough story to support the melodramatic twists in the last few minutes (none of which feel earned) and not enough sheer beauty in the spectacle to take your mindoff the cliched plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is fine, especially given their sketchy roles and they certainly work their asses off to perform the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It comes together once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, Eddie Kay (who also plays the boxer Neil Neill) shines as the referee, sliding around the stage at the beginning as he explains in poetic form the role he plays in thesport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The final match is staged nicely, with the referee and the girl sporting the round card criss-crossingthe stage during the bout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's the sparring match Bobby holds to decide who will face Ajay that fully captures what Frantic Assembly was going for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the first time, the oval on stage begins to rotate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boxers attack eachother and then one boxer suddenly freezes as he makes contact while the other one steps away, agonizesover their mistake or rethinks a move and then steps back into place just as they both begin to fightagain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a wonderfully theatrical way of breaking down a boxing match, capturing both the agony ofthose split-second moments and the beauty of the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They could have gone even further -- using this technique in other scenes to let the coach describe what they did wrong and how to counter it, for example, while the other player is frozen in time or just to getmore fully into a boxer's head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We could have learned about the strategy and chess-like moves in boxingalong with the boxer and thus come to appreciate the game even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would have tied in nicely with the opening monologue by the referee, which pointed the way towards a show that could have illuminated the game nicely in a fresh, theatrical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead we have a show that's not gritty enough forfans and not poetic enough for those who aren't fans and not insightful enough to create any new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 2010-2011 THEATER SEASON (ratings on a four star system) Angels in America revival at Signature *** out of **** Beautiful Burnout at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
