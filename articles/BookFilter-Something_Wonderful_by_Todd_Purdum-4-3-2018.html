(Genius is not always generous.) Did I mention the outstanding triumph that was the TV special "Cinderella" starring Julie Andrews? Purdum persuasively echoes the familiar argument that movies and TV were key to their falling reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Film versions of "Oklahoma," "Carousel" and "South Pacific" were sanitized of their bold topics, poorly cast orjust plain awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However commercially successful, they ruined the team's image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And their two biggest hits were by far thesweetest and simplest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though film version of "The Sound Of Music" notably improved on the stage show, it didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's a happy ending: with R&amp;H gone, bold new directors weren't forced to mount old-fashioned museum pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, from the 1992 London revival of "Carousel" onward, the memory of treacly high school productions faded andstartling, imaginative revivals revealed what adherents always knew: Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein were the boldest and mostfascinating of talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were pushing boundaries on what stories a musical could tell, how they would tell them anddoing it all with songs so precise and deceptively simple that everyone can sing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, in the right hands those "simple" songs reveal passionate depths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Purdum doesn't shy away from the personal, like Hammerstein's insecurities, Rodgers chasing after show girls or his battles with depression and alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's always in the context of how personalmatters affected their relationship and their work. "Something Wonderful" doesn't rock the boat with any unexpected claimsfor this show or damning of that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a solid, affectionate description of artists who look more important today than at any time since, oh, 1945. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "Todd Purdum’s skillful dual biography…strips away the accretions of time and reputation to retrieve the craft and dynamism with which his subjects created a new kind of musical."―The Economist "Readers will learn thestories behind the music and how this most successful of writing duos crafted some of the finest musicals tograce the American stage...Something wonderful, indeed." ―Booklist (starred review) "Joyous, brisk, andgossipy...An exuberant celebration of musical genius." ―Kirkus Reviews "Purdum’s anecdote-filled account is a sterling primer on the influential duo, both for newcomers to their work and to those looking to rekindle an old flame." ―Publishers Weekly “A scrupulously researched and infinitely fascinating history of the collaboration ofRodgers &amp; Hammerstein―two giants who propelled the musical theater to uncharted heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todd Purdumacknowledges the contribution of directors, orchestrators, composers of incidental music, designers, andperformers who helped produce the seamless integration that influenced those of us who were their disciples.His book is a fair-minded appreciation of these gods but acknowledges that they had feet of clay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is animpressive addition to the literature celebrating the American musical theater.” ―Harold Prince “Rodgers andHammerstein drew pictures, made lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They understood and rewrote the longings of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My favorite oftheir songs happens to be the book’s title: ‘Something Wonderful.’ I have sung it live, on stage, on recordings,and with the man I felt the same way about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love the intimacy of the stories Todd Purdum tells―he shows himself to be especially sensitive to Oscar Hammerstein’s special connection with Richard Rodgers.” ―Carly Simon “Before there was Netflix and Hulu, some of the most gifted writers on the cultural landscape wrotebeautiful and clever songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of the composers who bundled those songs together to accompany a story andthus gave us the Broadway musical, none have had more of an impact on the genre, or the business, thanRodgers and Hammerstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todd Purdum’s book is a piece of American history you should devour, as nothing tellsus about our times and ourselves quite like our songs.” ―Alec Baldwin “A reminder in these tribalized times thatmusical theater, once so central to our culture, is still vividly alive – and that the art’s twin titans, Rodgers andHammerstein, still matter deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clear, precise, and passionate, this is a necessary book, and even better, onethat is a joy to read.” ―James Kaplan, author of Frank: The Voice and Sinatra: The Chairman What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
