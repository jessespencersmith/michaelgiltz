"It iscompulsory; you will be ejected if you don't dance." Like old pros, they took pleasure in starting off theset with a new song, "New Babies, New Toys." The title track received some of the warmest applause ofthe night and they introduced another new tune -- "Sister Mary Says" -- by saying, don't worry, it'sactually quite good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

My favorite moment was the moody, quiet tune "New Holy Ground," with McClusky half in shadows and the music sounding like it was rising up from the bottom of the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the entire set was more fun than expected by this casual fan who had nothing more than the new album and a greatest hits set on his shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a way, OMD is more fun live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their sound on earlier albums might be a bit dry and poppy, but in a show with a live drummer (in this case original bandmember Malcolm Holmes, not to mention Martin Cooper on keyboards) and the warmth of imperfections to give their tunes a humanness, songs like"Souvenir," "Sailing On The Seven Seas" and "Joan Of Arc" (all Top 5 hits in the UK) sounded better thanever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps when a few thousand fans are cheering you along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a link to their upcoming shows inthe US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinionmakers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of CDs or digital downloads by numerous labels toconsider for review and feature coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee any coverage in exchangefor these CDs and indeed receives far more albums than he ever comes close to covering in his variousoutlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was provided with free tickets to this concert with the understanding that he would bewriting a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.com'Bed Intruder' Star AntoineDodson Arrested Paul Reiser's New Show Yanked After Two Weeks Mel Gibson Opens Up: 'I Could Easily Not Act Again Viral Star Antoine Dodson ARRESTED Gwyneth Paltrow Is Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're All Jealous.

Sign Siouxsie Now! (OMD? Good harmonies, tight musiciansh ip . . . what's not to like?) I was there last night, and I must say it was a fantastic show! They sounded great, and had just incredible energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy's moves were amazing/hi larious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who knew OMD are such a good live act? Well, seeing as they haven't played here in 23 years, probably not too many Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I, for one,hope they do come around again soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd definitely catch them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed!
