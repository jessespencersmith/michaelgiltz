One Man, Two Guvnors Three Cheers A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE ** out of **** ONE MAN, TWO GUVNORS *** out of **** A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE ** out of **** BROADHURST THEATRE This is not A Streetcar Named Desire simply cast with black actors in the lead roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a Streetcar untraditionally cast but in a way that is true to New Orleans, where blacks and whites and Latinos live together in a gumbo of love and desire and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's welcome, if nothing else, for showcasing Nicole Ari Parker, who I know best from her sharp and funnysupporting turn in Boogie Nights and the Showtime series Soul Food .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker almost puts her own stamp on Blanche and proves her Broadway debut is a notable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it comes in a production that doesn't begin to allow Parker's performance to flourish and deepen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blair Underwood -- also making his Broadway debut -- is thoroughly miscast as Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heprojects none of the violence or animal nature of this man (his tears of remorse are much more convincing than the off-stage beating of his wife) and despite his good looks there is no sexual tension in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, when Stanley rapes Blanche in act two, it seems to come out of nowhere and lead to nowhere, much like the streetcar that has taken Blanche to the end of the line.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened FOLLOW USCelebrity TV Political Hollywood Features Hollywood Buzz Videos Help Us Write 'The Words' Quick Read | Comments (27) | 08.20.2012August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

She doesn't seem bizarrely out of place, some exoticflower doomed to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, a fine Daphne Rubin-Vega is convincing as Blanche's sister Stella, when inmany shows the two women seem to come from different universes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker flirts with Stanley but it isn'treal flirtation, just the sort of harmless flattery women indulge in when they believe that's how best to getwhat they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stanley isn't attracted or repelled by her coyness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is not true of Mitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fun to see Wood Harris of The Wire in the role of this timid mama's boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their scenes of romance together are the most convincing human connection in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blanche's plan to start over with him doesn't seem like a fantasy but a pretty good idea for both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But whatever groundwork is laid in act one fails to pay off in act two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harris is less effective in his drunken revenge on Blanche and her aria where Blanche confesses every tawdry detail of her fall doesn'thave the power it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since there's no explosive sexual tension, Stanley's brutal attack comes out ofnowhere and makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blanche's final goodbye doesn't have the poignancy and heartbreak itshould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is more betrayed than shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Directed by Emily Mann, this Streetcar has little sense of place despite all the usual trappings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one of the show's biggest disappointments, the music composed by the terrific Terrence Blanchard is merely a bridge between scenes, squawking in effectively at some key moments but essentially just a mood-setter.It doesn't have the impact of embodying the turmoil underneath the drama, perhaps because the drama isn't providing any.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blanchard often does much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, the world of New Orleans is hardly present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jazz funeral crosses the stage, people go here and there and an unnecessary and unconvincing video projection hints at stores and other businesses, but itnever coheres into a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stanley and Stella's place is more rundown than raffish and with little ofthe charm that New Orleans has even at its most beat-down. (The serviceable set is by Eugene Lee.)Stanley's buddies who come over for poker barely make an impression; the same could be said for theneighbors who live above them, always fighting and making up and fighting again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With no world to setthis story in, no community to surround it and no raw passion and danger to inflame it, the ride on thisStreetcar is all too smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ONE MAN, TWO GUVNORS *** out of **** THE MUSIC BOX If you want a crash course in what makes the British laugh, don't head to London, head to Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See Peter and the Starcatcher for its loving nod to pantomimes (a holiday tradition of taking familiar tales and having a good giggle with them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then head to One Man, Two Guvnors , a charming chef's surprise of a comedy that tosses in music hall, vaudeville, slapstick, farce, Shakespearean clowns, lovers in disguise,and birds and blokes who fancy each other and somehow turns it all into a tasty dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a diverting treatrather than a substantial meal, but you won't feel guilty about enjoying yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Corden (TV's Gavin &amp; Stacey, The History Boys ) holds court as Francis, a working stiff who soon finds himself in the employ of not one but two bosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's desperately hungry and tries to keep both of them happy until he can finally score some cash and get a proper meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dolly (Suzie Toase) is an eye-popping distraction as a curvy working girl he wouldn't mind escorting on a holiday, but first things first.Food! Corden breaks the fourth wall, rolls on the floor, fights with himself, indulges in audience participation both real and imaginary, plays the xylophone and basically wins you over with uproarious charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's afull-sized comedian but it's hard to believe the pounds don't melt off him after such a strenuous eveningof theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe after the show he heads right to a big meal in some sort of cruel contractual obligation?Whatever the case, he's the steam engine that keeps this show running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie GOP Approves Abortion Ban DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the Silent Treatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3Like 4k Like 1k Recommend 8k Tom Hanks Solidifies Nice Guy Reputation Through Photos, Videos Why Bobby Brown Walked Out of Rehab Holly Madison Is Pregnant Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson's Shocking Tweets About Isaac Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin Fact-Checking '2016 Obama's America' Read my original review of the show in London here .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the cast is the same and if anything, they are better here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The piece itself -- an adaption by Richard Bean of Carlo Goldoni's The Servant Of Two Masters -- is a grab bag of pleasure, starting with the skiffle band that plays before the show and during intermission to the vaudeville turns and the shameless elderly waiter shtick of Tom Edden that could have kept him employed for decades back in the day of the variety circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second viewing reinforces my original impression that this is a pretty good play that depends a great deal on a great cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corden is a delight and Oliver Chris is hilarious as the upper crust Stanley Stubbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I believe he has slowed his delivery ever so slightly to allow American audiences to parse his British-isms but it hasn't slowed his comic timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a tad reserved about Daniel Rigby as the would-be actor Alan when I saw him in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, he was funny, but the part was a tad too broad for my tastes, even in this"anything goes" context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either I was more prepared for him or he's subtly tweaked his work because hereI found Rigby had humanized Alan just enough to keep his absurd posing rooted in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that makes him all the funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jemima Rooper gets the job done in a demanding part that must be vocally challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a special nod to the member of the ensemble whose work I was able to focus on the second time I saw the show for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She gave a natural, unaffected and very convincing turn that never milked her situation for laughs, thus getting more of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a nice bit of work and crucial to the high point of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, in a show like this after doing it off and off for more than a year, the tendency would be to go broader and play for more laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full credit to director Nicholas Hytner for keeping them tight anddisciplined amongst the silly bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Special nod to Cal Mccrystal for his work on the slapstick, dubbed herethe "physical comedy director." All the tech elements (the pitch perfect sets and costumes by MarkThompson, the lighting by Mark Henderson and the challenging work by Paul Arditti of providing soundfor a cast constantly on the go, a skiffle band positioned either on the side or moving to various parts ofthe stage, and numerous boinks and bonks to nail home the physical humor without drawing attention toitself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching it in London and New York is a real treat since you can compare the two crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UK audience loves this sort of comedy to its bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They simply howled from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However much the New York audience laughs (and they do, especially for the crowd participation moments), trust me, the London audience was louder by a factor of ten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were patches where the New York crowdwas properly amused but not uproarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toase's winning turn as Dolly is quite charming in particular,but she didn't get nearly the same reaction from the audience here that she deserved for her saucy asides.Certain jokes naturally had less of an impact -- namely a dig at Princess Margaret and repeated slaggingof Australia -- but it all translates easily into a funny lark of an evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four-star scale) The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** Assistance ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Blood Knot at Signature ** Bob *** 1/2 Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1950 ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 Carrie ** 1/2 The Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Close Up Space * Clybourne Park *** 1/2 Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Rob Shuter The Recession Chris Christie Osama bin Laden Israel Television Elections 2012 Latino Politics MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » ricky_martin RetweetMake Room for (the New) Daddy http://t.co/Q6eIDokm via @huffingtonpost feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, manyothers including octopi, havehuman-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQhDamn Yankees ** Death Of A Salesman with Philip Seymour Hoffman ** 1/2 Dedalus Lounge * 1/2 Early Plays (Eugene O'Neill at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse) * End Of The Rainbow * Ernani at Met w Angela Meade *** 1/2 An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Evita * 1/2 Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Galileo with F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray Abraham ** The Gershwins' Porgy And Bess *** 1/2 Godspell ** 1/2 Goodbar * 1/2 Gore Vidal's The Best Man ** 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 How The World Began * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Hurt Village *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later *** 1/2 Jesus Christ Superstar * 1/2 King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** The Lady From Dubuque ** 1/2 Lake Water ** Leo *** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Lysistrata Jones * Magic/Bird * The Maids ** Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Maple And Vine ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** Mission Drift * 1/2 Misterman ** 1/2 The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies at Papermill ** Newsies On Broadway ** 1/2 Ninth And Joanie * No Place To Go ** 1/2 Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This. * 1/2 Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 On A Clear Day You Can See Forever * 1/2 Once *** 1/2 Once on Broadway **** One Arm *** One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Painting Churches * 1/2 Peter And The Starcatcher *** 1/2 Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Private Lives ** Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Radio City Christmas Spectacular ** 1/2 Regrets * 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 Richard III w Kevin Spacey at BAM *** The Road To Mecca ** 1/2 Samuel &amp; Alasdair: A Personal History Of The Robot War ** 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Seminar ** Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2Shlemiel The First ** 1/2 Silence!
