"Why are people shooting at me?" he might ask, in a low murmur that barely rises above a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jolie spends the entirefilm posing and looking back over her shoulder with movie star aplomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The director's first film was thequiet German drama The Lives Of Others but he is sorely out of his depth here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the type of film you probably skipped in the theaters but might just rent or buy on DVD, thinking with these stars, how badcan it be? Pretty bad, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- I'm glad the Oscar-winning drama Milk exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was made with love and surely reached a lot more people with the inspiring, fascinating story of pioneering gay activist Harvey Milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But artistically, there's no comparison between that film andthis classic documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everything was said here, and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the best moments of the filmincluded real footage of memorial services for Milk that you can see here in a way that makes them all themore moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This 1984 was groundbreaking for discussing modern gay life in such a matter of factmanner and Milk is colorful and hilarious and best of all, effective in getting his message across about dignity and respect for all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Criterion can be trusted to provide an excellent print and insightful extras, including bonus interview footage, a piece on the film Milk, a panel discussion on the trial ofMilk's killer (which employed the famous Twinkie defense) and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Landmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JACKSON COUNTY JAIL/CAGED HEAT! ($19.93; Shout) -- Most of producer Roger Corman's movies are -- how should I put this? Bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they often have a B-movie silliness about them andCorman did give so many talented young filmmakers a break (though not much of a salary) that Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

SKYLINE ($39.98 BluRay and $29.98 regular DVD; Universal) YOGI BEAR ($35.99 BluRay combo and $28.98 regular DVD; Warner Bros.) -- These two movies have nothing in common except that they're both among the worst-reviewed movies of the year and both made a good amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yogi Bear in particular had solid legs, so somebody must have liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skyline was made by people who were also involved with Battle: Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They finished that bigger budget movie and then ran off and made a similar film for pennies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuits have all gone away,probably because both movies did well and made money for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yogi Bear is a classic kid's property ripe for revival but the weird mix of live action and the animated bears just looked off-putting from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both have modest extras; I think everyone was just glad to get their payday and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at Popeater.com'Bed Intruder' Star AntoineDodson Arrested Paul Reiser's New Show Yanked After Two Weeks LeAnn Rimes, Eddie Cibrian Married Jim Carrey Joins 'The Office' Viral Star Antoine Dodson ARRESTED Like 5K Daytime Disaster!

Crazy? Or just setting him up? The look and feel of the film is what I admire most, even when the plot contrivances became too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, it proves yet again that Beastie Boy Adam Yauch's Oscilloscope label has very good taste, always pickinginteresting films and packaging them nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JAMES BROWN: BODY HEAT LIVE IN MONTEREY 1979 ($19.95; Gravity/Wienerworld) COUNT BASIE: THEN AS NOW, COUNT'S THE KING ($14.95; MVD) DUKE ELLINGTON: REMINISCING IN TEMPO ($14.95; MVD) A HISTORY LESSON PART 1: PUNK ROCK IN LOS ANGELES ($14.95; Historical Records) - Here are four pretty shoddy music releases, all subpar in audio and picture and of only minimal interest HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES NBA Afghanistan Fast Food Gas &amp; Oil NASA Hockey Brian Williams Gabrielle Giffords Mexico MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »for even hardcore fans of the genre or artist involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The James Brown concert footage comes from a show in 1979 when he did the first of many comebacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's poorly shot and has worse sound; most of thetime you're just staring at Brown's head while he sings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Count and Duke are just glorifiedroundtables with artists that played with them, interspersed with old footage and (mostly) old stills. it'sfun to see these artists chat but their casual anecdotes and some stills do not a documentary film make.History Lesson contains interviews and very poorly shot concert footage, covering bands like The Meat Puppets, Red Kross, The Minutemen and Twisted Roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some major acts who deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STAND BY ME 25TH ANNIVERSARY ($24.95; Sony) -- One of the best adaptations of a work by Stephen King, director Rob Reiner's film still works thanks to great, great casting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; River Phoenix, JerryO'Connell, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton and Kiefer Sutherland? Good job all around and they keep thesentimentality at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A BluRay exclusive is a video commentary with Reiner, Wheaton and Feldman.Surely this sort of option will supplant the audio commentary in years to come? It's just too much fun towatch them chat and interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCARECROW AND MRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KING SEASON TWO ($39.98; Warner Bros.) -- Similr in tone and style to Remington Steele (which debuted one year earlier), this light-hearted TV series showed the burgeoningromance between a housewife and a spy who found themselves traveling the globe on assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure itcould happen! Neither show can hold a candle to Moonlighting, but they're silly fun, thanks to thechemistry here of star Kate Jackson (the smart Angel) and Bruce Boxleitner, one of those actors thatconstantly makes you wonder, how come he never had a bigger career?TOP LINKS ON THIS TOPIC 1 of 5 See Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie Make Out Now! - E!
