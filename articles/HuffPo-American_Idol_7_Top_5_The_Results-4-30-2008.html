(Just to nail on the head.) But it's growing on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the two gals Brooke and Syesha were alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They cut too soon to Brooke after naming her as the contestant going home so we didn't really get a chance to see Syesha's reaction (though I thinkshe was braced for hearing her own name called).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke broke into tears and for some reason Ikept expecting her to say they were grateful tears for the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She labored through Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

(Both of them were Top 20 hits in 1979.) "Blue Jeans" was nicely mellow as Castro is wont to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the bridge should have been stronger and it smooth-jazzed itself out intoblandness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, with "September Morn" (what, no "Red Red Wine" like we expected?), hestarted out great, handling the casual intro lines very nicely, but went off melody to no effect onthe chorus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His intensity never varied throughout either song, though "Morn" at least shouldclimax with the pain of a remembered love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They used to talk a lot about a "studio voice" on theshow and that's what Castro has -- it's a tentative, small instrument but interesting with someunique quirks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He can't deliver live yet; he may never be able to deliver live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in the studiowhere they can punch up weak moments and he can piece together an entire song bit by bit, Castrocould prove surprisingly effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy was mixed on both songs, Paula was very confused butseemed to like the first song but not the second and Simon was dismissive of both as forgettable,which was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID COOK -- Sang "I'm Alive" from Diamond's 1982 album Heartlight (whose title track was inspired by ET: The Extra-Terrestrial ) and "All I Really Need Is You" from 1991's Lovescape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk about digging up the rarities, especially when Diamond has so many well known songs Cook could have rocked out. ("Dry Your Eyes" could have been awesome and "Save Me A Saturday Night" from12 Songs is begging to be speeded up into a pop-punk hit.) But Diamond naturally was thrilled tohave Cook dig deep into his catalog ("He's got the right material," Diamond said unblushingly) andCook did it justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook did a solid job on "I'm Alive" (with the initials AC and some strangesymbols on his sleeves and AC on his guitar -- presumably a tribute to his brother?) He was evenbetter with "All I Really Need Is You," starting with an acoustic guitar, showing off confidentvocals, bringing it to a typical emo-ish rocker edge and then bringing it back down -- very true to himself, very confident and very engaging with two songs presumably most people had rarely or never heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy and Simon were mixed on the first and Paula was just confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the way, when they tried to do a rush review after everyone had performed once, Paula started critiquing Jason Castro's second song when he'd only performed one on the air so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Utterly confused and batty, but Simon gallantly stepped in and asked a quick pithy question: Who was your favorite? Paulafailed to answer even that so Simon jumped to a group review and said everyone needed to dobetter on their second song, giving Paula coverage for her wacky moment and moving the showalong nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man knows his job and does it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no conspiracy here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula eithermixed up her notes and was reading comments she wrote down for another performer (though notCook) or more likely she had made notes about what she thought of Jason's second songperformance based on the practice run-through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She could always adjust herself if -- rarely --someone was dramatically better or worse on the live performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, there is no agenda bythe show to make certain this person or that person gets through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Jason is cut, it's a scandal; ifhe isn't cut, he's a draw for having those nice eyes and a laid-back cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The producers really, reallydon't care what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all makes for good TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone rightly raved about Cook's second song, with Simon calling it brilliant and Paula saying she felt like she was looking at the next American Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, that may not be so crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DavidArchuleta has been very safe and not great the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he stumbles at the finals and givestwo mediocre performances, maybe it opens the door for Cook to win it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assume, without anyfacts to back it up, that Archuleta is way ahead of everyone else in voting and that he'd have to "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on Panel of ABC's "This Week" With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a panelistthis morning on...

"I'm A Believer" was of course the biggest hit of the Monkees' long career, which began with them taking songs from Brill Building writers like Diamond and later playing their own instruments and writing their own hits. (Maybe the Idol contestants will follow a similar path since they now play instruments and might write an original tune as part of the Top 12 competition some day the way they do on Nashville Star .) "I'm A Believer" was #1 for seven weeks in 1967. (The Beatles were the last act prior to the Monkees to stay at #1 for seven or more weeks, doing it in 1964 with "I Want To Hold Your Hand." The next act after the Monkees to do it? The Beatles again, in 1968 with "Hey Jude.") "I Am...I Said" may be Diamond's most notorious hit, a song that I believe sprang from psychoanalysis and features the absurd lines, "I am, I said/ To no one there/ And no heard at all/ not even the chair." Absurd, that is, until you hear Diamond sing it -- he sings it with such passion that you accept it completely and only smile or wonder about the line later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The man's so lost and confused he feels ignored even by inanimate objects -- that's just one interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in any case, something intense is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke as usual has no feeling for the lyrics and the actual emotional content of a song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sort of gets it should have a certain biting rhythm. "I AM I said, To NO one there" and so on, but there's no intent behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She just rambles through the first song, starting out too low, sounding flat and thin but looking good in serious flare pants and ruffly shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the second song, she sits at the piano and is sharp and robotic in her singing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges are indifferent or hostile to her first performance, which was just dull but -- rather bizarrely -- across the board positive about the second one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke did look comfortable at the piano and here's a chance to say introducing instruments has been a complete success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't seem to put the singers who don't play an instrument at adisadvantage and changes up the performances nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you someone who is a major talent onone or two or three instruments could win a lot of attention and votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right now, they're all justcompetent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it works but with someone truly gifted it could wow viewers and change thedynamic dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID ARCHULETA -- Sang "Sweet Caroline" and -- of course -- "America." Diamond's first Top 5 hit as a performer, "Caroline" went to #4 and was also his first single to go platinum. "America" comes from The Jazz Singer soundtrack to Diamond's notorious flop of a movie from 1980 that was lambasted so viciously, it makes the reviews for Mariah Carey's Glitter seem sympathetic in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ironically, the soundtrack was by far the biggest smash hit of hiscareer, selling 5 million copies and producing three top 10 hits including "Hello Again" (whichSyesha tackled) and "Love On The Rocks" (which might have made a nice bitter, change-upmoodwise for Castro) and his alternate national anthem "America." Archuleta bounced his waythrough "Sweet Caroline" but I had more fun looking for all his tics, like the breathing, the lickingof lips and especially the closing of his eyes, an almost irresistible impulse for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He really didn'tdo a very good job until the end, when he sang the last bit strongly and stared straight into thecamera and closed the deal with those white, Osmond-like teeth. (However, Ken Levine points outa huge mistake on Archuleta's part by not letting the audience do the "oh oh ohs" that make thetune such a crowd pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes, they play it at Boston Red Sox games but that just proves howlame they are since everyone knows Diamond is a lifelong Yankee fan.) "America" was equallyunimpressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seemed rushed, just like the entire show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When his voice cracked on the word"today" Archuleta smiled just a bit and plowed on like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did everything but wrap himself inthe American flag when it came to the section where Diamond inserted phrases from "America, MyCountry Tis Of Thee," with Archuleta looking more earnest than usual and staring deeply andwholesomely into the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diamond mentioned in the taped section that Archuleta wasn't surehow to end the song (which fades out with a whispered "today.") Apparently he just decided tothrow in some more patriotic tidbits, ending with "Let freedom ring!" Words that don't appear inthe song, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did Diamond suggest them or approve of them, one wonders? Regardless, hesang them very strongly, hoping to erase the memory of the choppy earlier moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assumesomeone with the initials "D" and "A" will win the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But being so-so several weeks in arow at least adds a little suspence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy loved the first song while Simon was mixed and they allloved "America." But I take issue with Simon saying Archuleta's choice of "America" was clever.No, it was obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SYESHA MERCADO -- Sang "Hello Again" (in bare feet) from The Jazz Singer and "Thank The Computers India Barack Obama Michelle Obama Sports Olympics Housing Crisis Fox News Cars MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

"Thank The Lord" indeed had a theatrical flair, as Randy said, with Syesha leading the clapping and taking us to church (a little).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had a lot of punch if not the complete success of the first tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy and Paula were very enthusiastic about the first song with Simon mixed and calling it "old- fashioned." Randy and Paula again loved the second one, but Simon was mixed and said Syesha "may be in trouble." She was dismayed but handled it well by simply asking "why?" Given how good her performances were compared to Jason and Brooke, why indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But beware when Simon makes such a comment; they may be self-fulfilling to a degree but the end result is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOTTOM THREE -- It should be Jason and Brooke and Syesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm going to ignore Simon and go with my ears and say Jason and Brooke in the bottom two and predict Jason is going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even Paula had nothing nice to say the second time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So are you a fan of Neil Diamond? Do you think Carly went home because of a Christian backlash to "Jesus Christ Superstar?" Is Paula part of some nefarious plot or just airheaded? Whose performance did you like?

Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Well, it's been clear that the judges watch rehearsals -- why wouldn't they? It letsthem get an idea of what the singers are working on and going for, let's them makesure what songs the singers are doing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few weeks ago, when Michael Johns did "A Day In The Life" on Beatles week, Paula said he had done it much better in rehearsals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one yelled and screamed that it was terrible for her to watchrehearsals and why not take notes while doing so? I almost always watch backevery performance twice before posting my piece and if I could I'd certainly watchrehearsals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the judges, including Paula, are capable of using any notes as aguide while reacting to the actual performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula just got scatterbrained andwas reviewing the performance of the second song during rehearsals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she'dwaited, she would have reacted to the final performance Jason gave, with therehearsal notes giving her some context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No scandal, other than Idol's inept dealingwith this tempest in a teapot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musicated See Profile I'm a Fan of Musicated permalink Well that was long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke was crying a river because she got tossed out of thesandbox...finally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her continued presence while more talented contestants fell by the wayside took meall the way through the Idol stages of confusion: mild annoyance, full-on annoyance, rant, indifference,speechlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyway, that was surely the worst group sing in the history of Idol (and I've been there for all of them), particularly the odd 'you take it, no you take it' exchange between Syesha and Brooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll betthat had Neil Diamond rolling over in his gra...dressing room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, that was mighty sloppy damage control on the Paula gaffe; protect, protect, protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's face it, whatever meds are interfering with her neurons firing have become more evident with each passing year so this won't be the last time they have to call the PR fire department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I really like Natasha Bedingfield because girlfriend has a great set of pipes and in an era of 'posers' she delivers the goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nobody needs to run a doubling track behind her strong vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just an aside but did anyone get the idea that when Bedingfield ran back over to the contestant set mentioning she had to say hello to 'David' that Cook stood up thinking she was referring to him? Thatis until she stopped and sat next to Archuletta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe I'm delusional but that's how it appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Yep, I thought the group sing-along was especially awful and they're almost always awful.Many people wrote and had the same impression that David Cook stood up when Natashamentioned David and then shamefacedly realized she meant Archuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I must admit Imissed it because I fast-forwarded through her performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LiberalBuzz See Profile I'm a Fan of LiberalBuzz permalink I was really hoping to see SOLITARY MAN and CHERRY CHERRY done, but nada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:58 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:36 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:16 AM on 05/02/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:13 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:18 AM on 05/02/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 5: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-5-n_b_99343.html [4/5/2009 7:04:00 PM] AND DARN YOU MICHAEL!!! DARN YOU ALL TO HECK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I actually watched part of the danged show so I could review your reviews better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DARN YOU! Plus I like Neil Diamond...I mean what the heck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if we could just get them to do some Allman Brothers Band stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah that's the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or UFO's Strangers in the Night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now THAT would be a challenge.I'd like to see some really good rock done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT pop rock but get down rock.Maybe even some doo wop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Watchig the show just so you can doubelcheck my reviews? Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I too expected Solitary Man to be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnny Cash did a good cover but Chris Isaak did a great one that I figured Cook might cadge from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Allman Brothers might be too far out of their comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe the Band would give them more leeway? LiberalBuzz See Profile I'm a Fan of LiberalBuzz permalink Actually it wasn't to doublecheck so much as to be able to keep up with yourreviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I kept reading them and thinking OKAY WHAT AM I MISSING HERE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inever really got into Idol as it just seemed to be so much 'Pop" which i really don'thave much use for, but I love reading your reviews (YES that is a bit of suck up butnonetheless true) so I figured what the heck, let's go check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was still kind of hard to swallow and I still think it is so over produced that we aren't seeing the real talent be able to shine through IF it exists, but I sat through alot of it and it was kind of sad to see Paula being so confused, YES she might have mixed up her notes from the earlier rehearsal but one has to wonder is there isn't any substance that might be altering her ability to think clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe?I like Paula, she is one of my favorite train wrecks and I just hope it doesn't become a serious train wreck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of those great smiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Musicated See Profile I'm a Fan of Musicated permalink I have great respect for all the fine guest writers and singers on the show who mentor with theirexpertise and catalog but Idol has consistently gone 'old school' when it professes to search for thenew, young, hip thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There needs to be more balance between the old and new and I wonder why amore contemporary star (Beyonce and her relatively large catalog?) isn't inserted into the mix moreoften.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mariah Carey was not a choice I would have made and yet it did add an interesting element tothe show and Carey, herself, was a surprisingly helpful mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm suggesting that there are plenty of good, contemporary artists who have solid catalogs that would work for the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't imagine too many artists turning down the 'face time' you get on Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink I think contemporary artists don't have enough of a catalog for them to dig into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But certainlya contemporary artist could be brought in to cover a classic genre they love, like say Usherfor r and b or the Jonas Brothers for Sixties music (or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idol might be stuck intothinking you have to focus on that artist's particular songs too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of people agreewith you that it's been too fuddy-duddy-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Andrew lloyd Webber was the tipping point.Personally, I think Neil Diamond has so many songs to his credit that cover four decades of music and has been getting some of the best reviews of his life so that to me, he's a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gwen Stefani and Mariah Carey shouldn't be the exceptions, they should be therule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:52 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:34 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:24 PM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:05 AM on 05/01/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 5: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-5-n_b_99343.html [4/5/2009 7:04:00 PM] observing See Profile I'm a Fan of observing permalink Good insight Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But please, change your photograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd like to use an illustration a friend did of me, but it doesn't fit into the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll try for some better lighting, but believe me, the more shadows the better when it comes to me. ghostofgrrrl See Profile I'm a Fan of ghostofgrrrl permalink Two points I highly agree with: 1. allowing instruments was a great move 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Castro is very marketable ghostofgrrrl See Profile I'm a Fan of ghostofgrrrl permalink yes, I just made a new verb "daughtry" much the same as "ollie" became a verb to skateboarders.if an Idol contestant makes it to the top 5, doesn't win, but reaches greater success than most of the winners, he or she has daughtried ghostofgrrrl See Profile I'm a Fan of ghostofgrrrl permalink I think Carly (and Michael Johns) went home because they were not willing to sign over completecontrol of their careers to Idolwhich is a smart plan, on their part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They got what they needed out of it and both are poised to"Daughtry" Saw Carly at a restaurant on Sat night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trust, she is doing fine and is aligned with some serious power to go for it right now!(oddly, another friend of mine, on the same Sat night., saw Jason and Sayesha and Brooke at arestaurant and said they all looked like deers in the headlights, but were trying to have fun) Carly was DEF having fun! BTW, if little David A's dad is not going to relinquish full control, the kid is not going to win Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Hey ghostofgrrrl, thanks for the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly and Michel Johns don't have any choice yet about where they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By appearing on the show at all, they must sign with the record labeland management team of Idol if Idol decides to pick up their option, whether they win or hitthe top 10 or just audition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they certainly didn't manuever to lose to avoid the typicallyawful albums Idol winners are forced to rush out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I do agree with you wholeheartedly thatCarly and Michael Johns will be better off artistically if they are not linked to the Idol machine.Maybe Jason and Syesha and Brooke looked like deers in the headlight because they allknow each of them is going to be picked off one by one and that the two Davids will be in thefinal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's kind of a weird time for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And interesting that the three of them were togetherbut not Cook and Archuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think we know that David A's dad has been some sort of control freak -- that's just tabloid gossip as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though if David's dad is a stage mom it wouldnt be the first time an Idol parent has been controlling ad hurt their kid's chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daughtry does indeed make a good verb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does it officially replaced "Aikenized?" kellygrrrl See Profile I'm a Fan of kellygrrrl permalink this was up in Oak Park which is north of Calabassas that's also where I saw Carly on the same Sat night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:37 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:56 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:38 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:55 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:45 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:39 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:44 AM on 05/01/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 5: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-5-n_b_99343.html [4/5/2009 7:04:00 PM] There was a film crew in the lot of the church across the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I got the impression they were filming something up there.lots of films and TV use this site and the shopping center we were at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't see J and B and S, my friend did. but I had the same reaction - interesting that the Davids couldn't join them cliffdvr See Profile I'm a Fan of cliffdvr permalink Have to agree with pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I am really on board with the David A cynicism thing.http://cliffdvr.blogspot.com/2008/04/american-idol-pop-on-rocks-final-five.html auramac See Profile I'm a Fan of auramac permalink If that had been record tracks instead of a TV competition, I'd buy Brooke's and I'd buy David Cook's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DA annoys me, I can't stand his voice, and Jason should go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His worst yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly went because shewas extremely over-rated, soulless, and obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charity See Profile I'm a Fan of Charity permalink you know, frankly, this is the first season of watching idol where i have felt the celebrity judges had it "infor" certain contestants - and for me, someone who can turn a show off and never watch again, that'spretty disturbing. it's one thing to dis a bad singer/entertainer on the show, but to consistently dis someone who actually CAN sing and who actually CAN perform and who actually gives us an entertaining two minutes - well, something smells - and has smelled for weeks - very fishy. and of course, i am talking about the constant dissing of syesha. she was, by far, the best performer of the evening and yet, my mouth flew open when simon ONCE AGAIN had the timerity to say he thoughtshe was "in trouble." WTF? i'm with syesha - WHY? and yet, simon still loves his little tone deaf brookie. consistently. no matter what she does - brooke to simon simply remains just so adorable and so cute he cannot fully criticize her one-note-samba-read:-no-range performances. again, this is the first time i've actually felt an 'agenda' on the part of the celebrity judges - the season- long dissing of some good singers has forced me to feel this way. i'm usually in agreement with simon,but with his lack of knowledge of certain songs and his continual blindness to contestants who can actually sing, i think this show has finally jumped the shark. no wonder the ratings are down. ghostofgrrrl See Profile I'm a Fan of ghostofgrrrl permalink well, I've seen plenty of instances where Simon dissing someone is the best favor in the world nothing gets the voters out there like Simon hurting their feelings.conversely, many times Simon has praised someone and we see that person take the bullet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colmore See Profile I'm a Fan of Colmore permalink I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really like Syesha, she is a good performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No comparison, talentwise, to Brooke orJason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find Jason obnoxious, not "charming" as Simon describes him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Jason gets anyfurther in this competition, it will be the last year for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is this year's Sanjaya, without thegood looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Charity, I too have been gobsmacked by the constant negative reviews for Syesha,especially since she's so darn cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is an agenda from the judges in the Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:15 AM on 05/01/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:07 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:36 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:22 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:48 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:02 PM on 04/30/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 5: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-5-n_b_99343.html [4/5/2009 7:04:00 PM] sense that tey like certain contestants and therefore cut them slack on weak performances and overpraise them on good ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I probably do the same thing.(Though I did change my tune on David Cook when he kept turning out really solid performances.) But that's the extent of the agenda -- their naturaly inclinations and prejudices peeking through, not any sort of plot by the show to rig it for certain outcomes as others have suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GoG makes a good point: knockingcontestants can create sympathy votes for them just like saying they look like theultimate winner can be the kiss of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I agree with Colmore, Syesha is head and shoulders above Jason and Brooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it'll be Jason to go next week instead of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GeoNorth See Profile I'm a Fan of GeoNorth permalink Cook is it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syeesha was better than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooke is just so damn wholesome, it's spooking me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DavidA just bores me and Jason is going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula, lay off the meds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're hallucinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink David A has definitely cooled off but those speed-dialing teenage girls still think he's cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hecan coast into the finals but he'll have to give a good (not great) performance to justify all thepeople voting for him who want to vote for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's still got to be the favorite but Cook hasdefinitely given himself a shot at an upset if Archuleta stumbles. mch755 See Profile I'm a Fan of mch755 permalink cont'4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David A- I found both songs unwatchable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no problem with the boy's voice, I just can't watchthis kid on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has so many quirks, you can literally count them off when he's on the stage. 2ndsong was shades of Kristy Lee's pander moment, I mean how can you diss someone when you had ahuge american flag behind you during your performance?5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Syesha- 1st song was ok, too many runs thrown in, 2nd song was much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looked great and seems to understand her time is running out, so she seems much looser than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think David A and Jason were the bottom two, but reality will give us Brooke and Syesah, with Syesha given the boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really didn't like ND night, just boring and ND though a nice guy was boring personality wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Paula needs to stop medicating herself! Its getting embarassing with all hergaffes. kristineIA See Profile I'm a Fan of kristineIA permalink I don't want Jason to go home tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's my second favorite in this competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love his voice eventhough it isn't particularly strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carly had a strong singing style and even though I thought she wasgreat, there were times when I wished she would have toned it down just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's just somethingabout a guy and an acoustic guitar that makes me mellow and happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I liked Brooke in the beginning, but she has become boring to me now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not bad, just blah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Except for "I'm A Believer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was BAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've liked Syesha much more in the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've always liked her voice, but she was forgettable to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems as though she's much more comfortable now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook is my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love his voice, and he keeps undressing me with his eyes through my television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta should put on some white gloves and join the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He makes me want to run and baste my turkey while he's singing so that I can finish before theSpongebob balloon floats by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd like to put in my two cents about boosting the sagging ratings of AI: I think it's time for Paula to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She adds nothing (except hairdo ideas) and listening to her speak is like watching a baby roll over forthe first time; you wonder if she'll ever, EVER get to the point without assistance. susieq1001 See Profile I'm a Fan of susieq1001 permalink I COMPLETELY agree with your comments about Paula!

"Claiken" is also maybe great, ala Barry Manilow, whofinished number two, to a fat-ass R&amp;B karaoke singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also don't like how they keep pimping Archuleta -- last night's examplewas Ryan's joke about downloading songs and saying viewers could "own a piece" ofArchuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't as bad as having a group of girls come on stage to hug him but it was stilltacky and seemed to single him out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not sure about Paula's prediction begin bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wemight get sick of the traditonal media telling us "Archuleta -- Archuleta -- Archuleta" but the judges have a long history of picking finalists and winners, including Simon saying Carrie Underwood would win it all from the very first auditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula, however, hasn't been asstrong a predictor so that alone may minimize what she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, she picked the underdog,so she'll have a hard road to being right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 pages total) You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Sweet Caroline A Diamond fan community for Neil's fans w/ photos, videos, &amp; more www.sweetcaroline.com Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:58 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:19 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:20 AM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:05 PM on 04/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:53 AM on 04/30/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 5: The Results http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-5-n_b_99343.html [4/5/2009 7:04:00 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type</p>
