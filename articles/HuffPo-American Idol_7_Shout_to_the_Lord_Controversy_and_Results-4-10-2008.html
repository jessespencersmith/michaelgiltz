I think Jordin is going to prove a much more durable artist than those who dismissed her as a teeny-bopper will expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's already hadseveral huge pop hits (including "No Air" and "Tattoo") and sure her album has only gone gold butpeople aren't buying albums right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She looked great and sounded great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Jason Castro was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is this guy gonna slide his way in mellow fashion all the way to the final three? Sure feels like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's barely placed a foot wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan teased Kristy Lee Cook before admitting she had avoided the bottom three -- where she lives -- and was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BOTTOM THREE -- Syesha Mercado, Carly Smithson and Michael Johns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I had predicted Syesha and Carly and Brooke, with Syesha sadly going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We saw promos from all three Presidential candidates with John McCain pretending he watches the show (joking about Simonwhen he wasn't joking about voting scandals in Florida and Michigan) and Barack Obama provingthe only one to stand next to the American flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Boom!

This wasn't really a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was Michael Johns going to make the finals? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So then going home before the finals (in whatever order) isn't a shock or a scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE "JESUS" CONTROVERSY -- Confession: I fast-forwarded through Idol Gives Back because life is too short to watch telethons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I caught the kids singing "Seasons of Love" from Rent but apparently missed another finale where they sang "Shout To The Lord," an evangelical Christian tune written by Darlene Zschech and covered by Ruben Studdard .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first line of the wildly popular tune is " My Jesus, my Savior." On the telethon show, the lyrics were changed from "My Jesus" to "My Shepherd." That's their first big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're going to sing a gospel tune, sing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why change that word? Just a week earlier, at least two songs by Dolly Parton were performed that mentioned Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Notsurprisingly, some evangelical Christians were annoyed, debating among themselves whether it was better than nothing to hear the song with the word "Jesus" dropped and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bizarrely, they began tonight's show with all the kids singing "Shout To The Lord" AGAIN, this time reinstating the proper words "My Jesus, my Savior." Big mistake number two and in fact itreally compounded the mistake they made the night before by making the song a groupperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thursday night was the first time I heard them perform this tune and as a practicing Catholic I was stunned, annoyed, upset for the performers and angry that this show had stumbled in such astupid way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't get me wrong: during Dolly week I suggested that some day they have a theme week devoted to songs of faith/gospel, which is practically what Inspirational Week is anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love gospel music and have dozens of CDs ranging from classics by Mahalia Jackson to the soundtrack to the terrific documentary Say Amen, Somebody to the great Marion Williams and more recent artists. (Not to mention religious music from around the world and many other faiths.) I'm happy to hear individual singers perform gospel tunes, even if they do come from a more evangelical wing of Christianity than I adhere to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course with the kids free to choose whatever song they want,songs of faith could be anything from the spiritual "Didn't It Rain" to Yusuf Islam/Cat Stevens'"Peace Train" to Jackson Browne's "The Rebel Jesus" to XTC's acerbic "Dear God." But asking all the kids to do a group sing on a born-again evangelical Christian number is wrong for manyreasons. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's unfair to the performers who want to win -- Pressuring them to sing an evangelical number is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who wants to be revealed as the Idol who refused to sing a song about Jesus? Think that might hurt their chances with Middle America? They should never have been put in that position. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's unfair to the performers of conscience -- I'm a Catholic and that's a tune we would never sing in Church, though none of its lyrics are of the sort that conflict with my faith. (Though many evangelical tunes, in fact, do and entire trends in Christian music are embraced by liberalevangelicals, rejected by conservative evangelicals and vice versa.) But what about the Idols who aren't Christian? Maybe some of them are Buddhist or agnostic or Jewish or Muslim or god forbid,atheist. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's offensive to the viewers -- I'm a Catholic and I was offended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't turn on Idol to be converted or evangelized to by the show -- and that's exactly what a group sing-along is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a statement by the show, not individual kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America is the most religiously diverse country in theworld (and I live in Queens, New York -- the most religiously and ethnically diverse corner of theworld).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's something to celebrate and it also means respecting other faiths and people of nofaith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't do that by hijacking Idol to make all the kids sing about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if each and every one of them is born again and dying to sing the praises of the Lord, you don't alienate theviewers like me -- and most Americans are not evangelicals -- who don't identity with thatparticular strand of Christianity.

As a Catholic who embraces aloving God, I'm not theologically trained, but dismiss out of hand the idea of a God who wouldcondemn you to hell just because you were born in India or China and lived a decent, God-fearing life as a Budhist or Hindu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gandhi is in hell? Many if not most faiths would scoff at theidea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, it is essential to my faith to be loving and respectful towards other faiths and themore I learn about them (even the ones I disagree with) the more I can respect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theidea of disdaining other faiths that spring from the same Abrahamic tradition seemsmisguided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know the Pope believes Catholicism is the one true way to God, but he ismeeting with Muslims, Jews and others in prayerful communion this week, isn't he?

This is after all a singing contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is, after all, an attempt to identify a singer who can sell records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leaving this genre out of the game is like leaving out Country or leaving out Pop. "Shout to the Lord" is a popular Christian worship song and has been quite popular for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has been recorded several times and is featured on albums that have gone platinum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to remember folks, this is a singing contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It amazes me that singing this song has caused controversy, while if someone sang "Sympathy for the Devil" which is a great rock and roll song by the Rolling Stones, no one would have batted an eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink You attended a very unusual public high school if you had a choir in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Music,theater, art -- all out the window at most public schools in the country, sad to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if you attended a public school and they had a choir AND "the bulk" of what they sang is Christian music...well, I don't know where you went to school but in the current political climate thatstrikes me as bizarre to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm surprised parents haven't complained and the ACLUfiled a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is NOT standard practice -- whether someone thinks that's terrible orwonderful, it just isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I sang in the choir on Sundays when I was little at my Catholic church,but my Catholic school did not have a choir as such, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And obviously you didn't attend BobJones University, where they ban CCM from the dorm rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As my post, said (did you read it?), I explcitly said Shout To The Lord was not offensive to me as a Caholic lyrically though there are MANY evangelical songs that emphasize ideas orbeliefs not compatible with my faith (which ain't the same as being "offensive," just tunes Iwouldn't sing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, there are whole branches of CCM that liberal evangelicals reject andvice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CCM is a vibrant genre, though like every other genre it is struggling in the post-record store world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since you can buy Larry Norman and Keith Green on iTunes, it willsurvive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WebDeb See Profile I'm a Fan of WebDeb permalink So sorry for you, but yes we did and yes they still do, and no lawsuits are filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Youmight be surprised at the number of public schools who still rely on this music toteach 4 part harmony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was simply pointing out that this is a singing contest, so let'snot get our panties in a twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't like 50s or 60s week either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regarding whether you were offended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you weren't, I guess in point #3 "I am a Catholic and I am offended." was a "mis-statement"? Obviously, I read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christian music is a part of the market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I used to work for a label as creative director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I understand the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WebDeb See Profile I'm a Fan of WebDeb permalink Thanks for your reply, but I stand by what I say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This "surprising" fact that Christianmusic is sung in public high schools is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, that same school I attended, thatmy grandchildren attend, still uses those songs to entertain parents at concerts inthe high school drum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't shoot the messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just think people makesuch a big deal out of everything that they don't personally agree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yes, Michael I read your post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, I was commenting on the fact that you mentioned in your bullet point #3. "I'm a Catholic, and I was offended".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sooooooo maybe you didn't proofread before you posted?

If you aren't maybeyou should apply for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, you don't have to be a republican to have an opinion that doesn't agree with yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, republicans don't have the market cornered on faith either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a right we all have, to worship as we choose, and to embrace what we choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UnlessMcBush gets in the White House, then you can probably kiss that goodbye too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So some people wanted to hear this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what?

(That same week I suggested they devote an entire week tosongs of faith/gospel) though of course Inspirational Week opens the door to anyone who chooses to sing such tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't condemn the song -- I condemned telling all eight contestants of varying faiths (or no faith at all) to sing an evangelical Christian song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's it.As some evangelical Christians pointed out in the comments, Shout to the Lord is intended to proselytize and shouldn't be sung without sincerity and a desire to spread the word of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doing so would cheapen the song and its message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just one more reason why having it as a group sing-along was inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guitarsandmore See Profile I'm a Fan of Guitarsandmore permalink Listening to a hymn with four part harmony can be very awe inspiring indeed especially when you are standing right in the middle of it and it surrounds you from all sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would have picked "Fairest Lord Jesus" for the group song; that"s the one that goes " Beautiful savior! Lord of the nations! Son of God and Son of man!" and so on and so forth ..You know the one? If you are Catholic or Lutheran you have to know that one! The other song that could have been done is of course "Amazing Grace".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here was a missed opportunity to sing a hymn with some great four part harmony and "Amazing Grace" has such a longstoried history behind it that it almost transcends controversy about religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Napster has 493 differentrecordings of Amazing Grace by artists ranging from Aretha Franklin to Phish, and from the Oak RidgeBoys to the Vienna Choir Boys to Jeff Beck; but I could find only one recording of "My Jesus, MySavior".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are some really beautiful hymns worth listening to and if you really do love music you will appreciate the sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Music is not about the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Words without music is just poetry and American Idol is not a poetry contest. soonerdem See Profile I'm a Fan of soonerdem permalink It never fails.Someone can't rest untill religion is inserted.This gives assurance that we can have controversy.If Jesus were here today he would most likely be vomiting as He watches all the bullshit going on in this day and time. mydogshakespeare See Profile I'm a Fan of mydogshakespeare permalink What's all this buzz about "God" and "Jesus"?
