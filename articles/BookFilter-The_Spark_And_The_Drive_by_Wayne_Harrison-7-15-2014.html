Not a lot, so Justin remains true to his boss, even as he sees things changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What author Wayne Harrison captures so well is the young adult in Justin, the very identity that has given its name to a genre, or rather to a marketing tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justin really IS a young adult, a young man who isn't quite a kid anymore and knows right from wrong and is old enough to make his own decisions and figure out who he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But let's face, he's still kind of a kid and in over his head awfully quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he knows he's in over his head and isn't that the natural state of things for most adults? It's only kids and fools who think they have everything figured out and under control all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an assured, sensitive and very promising debut novel and almost makes me wish I could strip an engine and build it up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say"An engaging debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Richard Russo, Philipp Meyer, and Mark Slouka, Harrison understands the rusting body of American labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are grease-smeared pages, full of the sounds of revving motors and the anxieties of narrowly educated men in a fading field." —Washingtonpost.com"There's nothing I enjoy more than entering a fictional world over which an author demonstrates</p>
