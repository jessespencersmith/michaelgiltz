Too embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And too bizarre a death for this aginggentleman, and him newly wed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His murder, and the suspicion falling on his young niece, quickly plunge the Australians into a queer world of British aristocracy, Fascist Blackshirts, illicit love, scandal, and spiesranging from London and its suburbs to Bletchley Park and Oxford, andinevitably drawing in Wil Sinclair as well as players like H.G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells and Winston Churchill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a world where gentlemen are not always what they are dressed up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Go to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.Share This Book About The Author Sulari Gentill After setting out to study astrophysics, graduating in law and then abandoning her legal career to write books, Sulari now growsFrench black truffles on her farm in thefoothills of the Snowy Mountains of NSW.Sulari is author of The Rowland Sinclair Mystery series, historical crime fiction novels (eight in total) set in the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sulari's ADecline in Prophets (the second book in theseries) was the winner of the Davitt Awardfor Best Adult Crime Fiction 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was also shortlisted for Best First Book (A Few Right Thinking Men) for the CommonwealthWriters' Prize 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paving the New Roadwas shortlisted for another Davitt in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $15.95 () Published: June 05, 2018Personalize / Add More Choices What We Say This light mystery is right up my alley, from the time period (between the wars) to the setting of London to the slightly bohemian Aussies slumming it in among British aristocrats when they stumble upon a murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the cover appeals."Gentlemen Formerly Dressed" is the fifth in a series starring Rowland Sinclair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rowland's brother is in politics and generallydisapproving of his little brother's adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No surprise: our amateur sleuth is swimming in money, quite a talented artist and his friends are Communists and sculptors and jolly good fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They apparently dash about the globe getting into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book begins with them arriving in London after Rowland was attacked, had his arm broken and was nearly killed byNazis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's determined to make someone in the British government listen to his warnings about this Hitler fellow, but no onecares what an artist and an Aussie thinks about anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To top off his failure to raise an alarm, one meeting begins withRowland stumbling upon the body of a blue-blooded nobleman wearing a woman's nightie and impaled with a sword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all very scandalous and hush hush, but since an innocent young woman may be convicted of the crime just to keep things tidy, Rowland and his friends spring into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon they're tussling with British fascists, getting private tours of MadameTussaud's, politely turning down same-sex proposals from royalty and sharing opinions with everyone from Evelyn Waugh (abore) to H.G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells (quite a jolly chap) to Salvation Army volunteers (boring, but nice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of this SHOULD be delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The details feel forced (like the author's pointed explanations of what this or that title means), the characters aren't nearly as amusing as they want to be (the biggest running gag involves the quoting of poetry) and since I didn't readbooks 1 through 4 I have no clue as to why our hero's interest in his marvelous friend Edna (who clearly fancies him) shouldbe such a non-starter. (They love each other but it's not meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For some reason.) And the mystery is banal, with theusual red herrings and an uninteresting reveal of the real villain(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I shan't make their acquaintance again any time soon. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "The murder case...is just an entr√©e into what Gentill does so well: serve up intensely realized period details and reminders of the intersections of crime, art, society, and politics." (Connie Fletcher Booklist) "The pleasure of this novel lies...in observing Rowland at dinner with Evelyn Waugh, trading insights with H.G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells, and setting Winston Churchill straight on the evils of nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of upper-class sleuths will be in theirelement." (Publishers Weekly) "The combination of famous historical figures, detailed descriptions of a troublingtime, and plenty of action makes for a tale as rousing as it is relevant." (Kirkus Reviews review of Paving the NewRoad) "This book has it all: intrigue among the British aristocracy, the Nazi threat and a dashing Australian hero.I didn't want it to end!" (Rhys Bowen, author of the New York Times bestselling Royal Spyness and Molly Murphymysteries, and the #1 Kindle bestseller, In Farleigh Field) "Rowland's determined attempts to open British eyes tothe gathering storm combine mystery, rousing adventure, and chance meetings with eminent figures fromChurchill to Evelyn Waugh."
