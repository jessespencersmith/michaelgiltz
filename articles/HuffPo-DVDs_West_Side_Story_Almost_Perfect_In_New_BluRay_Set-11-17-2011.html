(By the way, the decent booklet contained in the deluxe setmentions almost every film Lehman worked on except The Sound Of Music oddly enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why did I never realize Lehman's screenplays begin both movies in the same way: with quiet montages of the city/the hills to create a very distinct mood?) If you have the 45th Anniversary set, you might not want to give up the thick booklet that contained the entire screenplay, but this set has loads of nice stuff like ahardcover book with some good essays, postcard sized editions of movie posters from the film around theworld and a CD with eight covers of songs from the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They messed up the legendary opening where the credits designed by Saul Bass dissolves into the city skyline (instead, the screen fades to black, fades in again on a title card of Bass's design and then dissolves into the city skyline) and others spot problems with syncing I haven't spotted yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, on a first look the picture and sound look good and the musical as fresh and fun as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LARRY CROWNE ($34.98 BluRay or $29.98 DVD; Universal) -- Tom Hanks is gonna be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has several very promising films in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus he's done some strong work as a director, namely his charming debut That Thing You Do and episodes of two great miniseries he made happen, Band Of Brothers and From The Earth To The Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's a shame a person of his taste should let his second feature film directorial effort be such an uninteresting romantic comedy with no fresh angle or dialogue or insight or anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's easy to see what motivates him towards those other works (World War II, space, a certain sweet era of pop music).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what was the attraction for this empty tale of a middle-aged man who loses his job, goes back to college and falls in love with his super-hot teacher? Maybe it waslending a helping hand to screenwriter Nia Vardalos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And certainly he planned to make a good film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the road to bad cinema is paved with good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOONEY TUNES PLATINUM COLLECTION VOLUME ONE LIMITED EDITION ($79.98 BluRay or $59.98 BluRay standard) -- We've seen smart, chronological, collector friendly editions ofMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Loyal Dog Refuses To Leave Owner's Grave, Goes Week Without Food Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?

So you get 50 shorts and loads of extras and either set (the limited edition or the standard BluRay) is a great buy for newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who have already bought it and want to make the transfer to BluRay will just have to hold onto their old sets since this doesn't duplicate any earlier version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EVIL DEAD 2 25th ANNIVERSAR EDITION ($14.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) -- "What would it mean to you if I said, 'I hadn't seen Evil Dead 2 ...yet?'" "It would mean you're an idiot." That give and take from High Fidelity gives a hint of the passion that director Sam Raimi's fans have for his schlock B masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Bruce Campbell starrer has been properly remastered for this BluRay release and looksabout as good as a low budget horror film should look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loads of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why this wasn't released before Halloween is a mystery but it'll make a good Christmas gift for the horror fan in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER ($24.95; Film Movement ) -- The label Film Movement has made a habit of plucking choice movies out of film festivals and bringing them to a wider audience whenthe movies might otherwise have disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've done it again with The Human Resources Manager , a movie they released in theaters early this year for a few months where it quietly continued to garner good reviews for this story of the human resources manager of a bakery in Jerusalem who musthead to Romania to pay his respects to the family of an employee killed in a suicide bombing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acclaimed in Israel, it's the sort of film serious buffs should not miss.TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 More Entertainment News at THR.com More Celebrity News at People.comFor Bodysuits (Photos) Cynthia Nixon: Max Will Try His First ThanksgivingStuffing READ MORE Heidi Klum Takes Her Kidsto Katy Perry's Concert READ MORE Miss Piggy KeepsPaparazzi at Bay byTossing Cupcakes READ MORE 'TOWIE' Star Amy Childs Opens a Salon George Michael in Hospital Asylum Snowtown Interview The Greatest Guitar Player Of All Time Revealed!

It's the sort of series that's not iconic enough to get the full-blown treatment but the hardcore fanswho like it can only be disappointed by the decent but not great prints used, the failure to include the fulland appropriate theme songs for each season (the title sequence changed) and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, the expanded version of the pilot even includes a disclaimer warning us not to pirate said videocassette. (Happily, it doesn't look VHS bad; the image quality is akin to the rest of the set.) All those faults could be taken witha grain of salt by fans happy to just have some sort of edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the pricing is premium and the packaging is...bizarre, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a flimsy cardboard box, albeit of the right dimensions to fit on a shelf alongside other DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Balanced on the top is what I thought to be a deck of cards but turns out tobe drink coasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's balanced on a flimsy cardboard stand of sorts that takes up most of the room ofthe box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the bottom you find a loose booklet, a senitype made to imitate a frame of film featuring Wagner and then the actual discs in three season fold-out wallets in the size of a CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can set aside everything else but then those DVDs and the loose booklet look out of place next to regular DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'sawkward, cheap, wasteful and annoying since if you use the box getting out the DVDs is a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you've been warned.THE SLEEPING BEAUTY ($27.99; Strand) -- Has it really been nine years since director Catherine Breillat delivered Fat Girl, her best movie by a mile and one that wasn't nearly so didactic or obvious as her others? Apparently, but she's been replenished at the well of classic fairy tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year's Bluebeard earned raves from my friends who are not always keen on Breillat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here is The Sleeping Beauty, which begins as a fairy tale, edges into eroticism and ends with a modest critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little girl is cursed by a witch to die on her 6th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But her fairy godparents deflect the curse into just causing her to sleep for 100 years and wake up as a 16 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's a twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So she won't get bored, they promise lotsof adventures in her dreams, which mostly consist of a spin on The Snow Queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all presented in arather faux, make-believe manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until the girl wakes up at 16 and deals with the modern world in theform of a strikingly handsome young man/suitor called Johann (David Chausse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not for everyone and the changes in tone are jarring, but it's interesting and fun MY FAIR LADY ($29.99 BluRay; Paramount) -- I've never been a big fan of the film version of My Fair Lady; it's always felt like a museum piece to me. (The show itself, of course, is a classic.) So I'm of two minds here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes lavish boxed sets feel like a chance to make you pay again for a movie you already own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This no-nonsense package has the many excellent bonus features from an earlier DVD release, sowho needs some expensive booklet and packaging to spruce it up? Not me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, the one area they shouldn't skimp is the print and remastering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely a Best Picture winner like this deserves better than the perfunctory job offered here, especially since the film has been recently restored soexcellent source material is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will do ok for newcomers but is not the big improvement overDVD that it should be.CRIME STORY THE COMPLETE SERIES ($29.98; Image) -- This seems to be the week for unsatisfying boxed sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About the best that can be said for this Michael Mann TV show is that it's available, so if you really want to see some version of this Dennis Farina cop show set in 1963, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The picture quality is poor (and this was a lavish, great-looking show) and the music is not always theoriginal source cues (and Mann had a great ear for music).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's cheap and it's here so if you had to choose between this and some poor import or bootleg, at least know you have the option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was actually looking forward to revisiting this show, which lasted for two seasons and had a great cast and guest starslike Bill Campbell, Stephen Lang, Anthony Denison and Farina, who had the role of his career here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthe quality on display makes it more likely this'll sit on my shelf unwatched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The money and demand just wasn't there to do it right, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GIORGIO MORODER PRESENTS METROPOLIS ($29.95; Kino) -- I can't imagine anyone wanting to see this movie except as an example of how wrong people can be about the best way to bring new fansto a classic film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've seen the Fritz Lang classic numerous times with numerous new scores but this horror with pop tunes by Pat Benatar, Freddie Mercury, Bonnie Tyler and other early Eighties stars is justdreadful, from his synth score right down to the final godawful tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't a newly remastered print with the Moroder tinting and score, it's the version he restored at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically accurate (as far as what Moroder did), well-meant, but not to be endured, I'm afraid unless you really really like AdamAnt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz was provided with free copies of the DVds and BluRays with the understanding that he would be considering them for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generally, he does not guarantee to review and hereceives far more titles than he can cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltzTOP LINKS ON THIS TOPIC 1 of 5 Natalie Wood investigation prompted by boat captain's comments - latimes.com L.A. sheriff reopening Natalie Wood case - Celebrity Circuit - CBS News Natalie Wood Case: What's the Yacht Captain's Motive? - E!
