                <p>oul singer Sharon Jones makes her movie debut in the Denzel Washington drama "The Great De- baters," which opened Christmas Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she had to tick off Lou Reed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was touring with Reed when he was per- forming his classic 1973 album "Berlin," with Jones in a backup choir that included Antony of Antony and the Johnsons, among others. "It was a beautiful thing," says the 5l-year-old sing- e4 who was born in Augusta, Ga., and grew up in Brooklyn. "Then when we got to Australia, Lou gave me two ver-ses on "Sweet Jane" and the people went crazy, and he almost cried, said I took him to the mountaintop. "I was getting ready to go away with him agaih in June and July for a European touf, and then this movie came through three days before I was leaving, and I let Lou down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And oh my God was he angry." "The Great Debaters,' which co-stars Forest Whita- ker and is produced by Oprah Winfrey, is the second film directed by Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He stars as the debat- ing coach at all-black Wley College in Texas, which famously competed against Harvard in 1935.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones plays a juke-joint singer and performs six songs on the soundtrack, including a number of gospel funes like "Up Above My Head" and gritty soul numbers like "That's What My Baby Likes." But tell that to Reed. "I saw him in July at Prospect Park for this Doc Po- mus tribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I got there, I saw Lou on the oth-ran him down and said, 'Lou, it's me, Sharon.'He said, 'I know,'and turned around and walked awayfrom me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But me and him had bonded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't do anything to hurt him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm a nobody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whywould he treat me like that? I grabbed him and said, 'Iou, give me a hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please don't walk away, Lou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am so sorry, Lou.' "I said, 'Lou, come on, you're talking Denzel, For- est Whitaker and Oprah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Come on, Lou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't turn down Oprah.'He finally did write me a letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he understood." So Jones survived Reed's anger and made up, like she always has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A one-time corrections officer at Rik- ers Island, Jones knows one thing: Never show fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she has been fearless in recording gritty, old- school soul music for tiny Daptone Records with the fierce band the Dap Kings for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The work finally began to pay off with their second album, "Naturally," which won terrific reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ThenAmyWinehouse came calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The English pop star used the band on her breakout album, "Back to Black," and the hit single "Rehab," giving them a higher profile than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they've capitalizsd witlh a new album, il00 Days, 100 Nights," that's even funk- ier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones herself is getting better reviews thaneve4 despite a lifetime of being told she wouldn't make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When success hits, she'll know how to handle it. "These young peoplejust don't know," says Jones. "I'm 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been out here too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ain't no fallin' down here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I had money, I would definitely know what to do with it, because I haven't had money mySinger Sharon Jones wraps up the year in 'Great' style f^t Dry . ig-lial6'7BY MICHAEL GILTZ Euz -Ju Y</p>
