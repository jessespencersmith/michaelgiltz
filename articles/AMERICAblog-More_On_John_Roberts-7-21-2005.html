                <p>T H U R S D A Y , J U L Y 2 1 , 2 0 0 5More On John Robertsby Michael in New York on 7/21/2005 09:45:00 PMJeffrey Rosen says that the John Roberts he interviewed threeyears ago didn't appear to be an ideologue or angry -- the wayScalia and Thomas are -- holding out the slim hope thatRoberts could be this Bush's Souter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wishful thinking, maybe,but Rosen also suggests some tough lines of inquiry to getinsight into Roberts' philosophy.Mario Cuomo uses a USA Today op-ed to denounce ANYONEwho tries to stack the courts with activists to achieve goals(like overturning Roe V Wade) they can't accomplish throughthe Congress and states.Most political analysts believe that President Bush, bynominating Judge John Roberts, seeks to put on theSupreme Court a justice who will help achieve significantchanges in laws through judicial decisions that the politicalbranches of our government have failed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thatwould include limitations on abortion and the separation ofchurch and state.That sounds like Bush, don't it? And what Bush wants sure soundslike an activist judge to me.Laurence Tribe weighs in via a USA Today article, saying that he toohasn't seen Roberts as a firebrand. (Hey, none of this means oneshouldn't examine him extremely closely before making up yourmind, but it's better than hearing your worst fears confirmed, isn'tit?)"That makes the (Senate confirmation) hearings all themore important," says Harvard University law professorLaurence Tribe. "He doesn't have a long history of writings,"as had Robert Bork, the former appeals court judgerejected for the high court in 1987."His appearance of decency and friendliness is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I dothink that his substantive philosophy, as much as I see itexpressed, raises questions that require exploration."While Tribe emphasizes the need to learn Roberts' views, hesays the nominee does not appear to be a crusader. "I don'tthink John Roberts is putting on a gladiator suit as hemarches toward the court," says Tribe.And the American people in a poll quite reasonably say, hey, we needmore info.76% said they needed more information before they coulddecide whether his views were "mainstream."74% felt it would be appropriate to ask Roberts aboutabortion at the hearings.Guess what, the Dems are right in line with the American people.Let's take a a careful look at his (limited) record and hear what hehas to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doesn't mean they won't bring down fire and brimstone ifhe proves to be fringe.Why does Bush think the American people are stupid and wrong towant more information (meaning Roberts can't play dumb andpretend he has no opinion on landmark Supreme Court cases) andwhy does Bush think the American people are stupid and wrong tothink asking about abortion is perfectly ok?
