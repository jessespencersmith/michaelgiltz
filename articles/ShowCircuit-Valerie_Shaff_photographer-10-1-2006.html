                <p>Charley and Destiny Equine-imity ARTIST VALERIE SHAFF is lying on her back while we talk. "I just came back from the barn and from yoga;' she laughs. "And I'm just getting over a bOllt with Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's been very challenging." Photographer Valerie Shaff captures the dignity and personality of the horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based in upstate New York's Germantown, Shaff has worked in every possible way as a photographer: she's done everything from wedding photography to advertising, celebrity portraits for national magazines, and private commissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Giltz /~, S HOW C IRe U IT (154: ''---_/ FAlL 2006 Suzanna the Horse Whisperer Shaff is probably best known for her witty, respectful focus on animals, which led to a series of best-selling books with hu­ morist Roy Blunt Jr. that include If Only You Knew How Much I Smell You: True Portraits of Dogs to Am I Pig Enough for You Yet: Voices of the Barnyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, amidst all her professional obligations, Shaff do­ nates time to Puppies Behind Bars, an organization that brings prisoners and puppies together so that the puppies can be so­ cialized and trained and, ultimately, work as service dogs and seeing-eye dogs for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That volunteer work led Shaff to a current project where she does portraits of prisoners who have successfully transition ed back into society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, from that first Kodak camera Shaff received when she was 8 years old to today, one constant has been her fascination with and love of horses. "I wasn't the horsiest of little girls;' recalls Shaff, who is 50. "There was always a group of girls who were referred to as 'the horses' and they galloped around at recess and had long pony­ tails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was not a 'horse,' per se, but I always certainly loved hors­ es.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I grew up in Hastings-on-Hudso n, which is suburban, though pretty, so there weren't a lot of horses there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So whenev­ er we went on vacation and any horse we crossed paths with, I had to shoot them." Perhaps one reason Shaff finds horses so fascinating to pho-tograph is the difficulty it presents. "Horses are so challenging;' states Shaff. "What I'm interest­ ed in when I photograph animals-besides wanting to make something that's formally beautiful-I like to monument alize the specific animal and really capture its personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can manipulate dogs in many ways, for example; they're very re­ sponsive to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whereas horses are by and large not nearly as interested in people as dogs are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To get them to do something you want them to do-when you're not on their back-is very difficult:' Off course, getting horses to do what you want even when you're on their back isn't always so simple either! "I ride at a wonderful, wonderful equestrian center called Southlands Foundation ;' Shaff describes. "It was established by a woman named Deborah Dows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the family estate was being divided up, she asked for the south lands and created this equestrian center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The people who teach there were her original students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a beautiful land concern as well as being an eques­ trian center. ''I'm not such an equestrian that no matter where I live I would make a point of riding, but I ride here because South­ lands exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's such a beautiful place, and the horses are so well-treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We probably have some of the best school horses that any barn has ever had."
