                <p>\ Where's the 'Sex'? Carrie washes her mouth out for TBS 3 By MICHAEL GILTZ ~I (31 QLf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOW do you turn the R-rated capers of Carrie Bradshaw and her pals on "Sex and the City" into a syndicated hit? Short of excising all scenes with Kim Cattrall, you have to leave much of the sex and nudity to the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans can see how the HBO hit was modi­ fied for TBS when the network begins its broadcast of the series, which ran for six seasons, with a five-night marathon of 10 episodes starting Tuesday at 10 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viewers who have never seen the show will just see a smart, well-acted comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Compare the original with the TBS edit and you'll get some funny insights into Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) cleans up. , what's acceptable fare on basic cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On "Ex and the City," the show's second­ season finale, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) explains her panic about seeing Steve. her ex-boyfriend, by saying, "The man has been inside me, for God's sake." TBS toned the scene way down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its version, Miranda merely says, "We've been intimate, for gosh sakes." In the premiere episode of the third sea­ son, the cuts are just as widespread .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one scene, Samantha corrects Miranda, who refers to Steve as just a friend. "No, we're just friends," Sam says. "I don't put my d--k in you." Miranda, who is drinking a Staten A naked encounter between Samantha and a fireman is only available on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Island Iced Tea, jokes, '\\nother one of these and I might let you." That scene, along with a notorious, naked encounter between Samantha and a fire­ man, are only available on DVD. "Drama Queens," from season four, fea­ tures a book called "Marriage, Inc." Sam reads out loud, "Chapter One: how to get ahead by giving head." In a rare example of awkward overdubbing, Cattrall is seen mouthing the same line, but heard saying, "How to get ahead by putting out." People who know their "Sex" won't like these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for those who prefer their naughty talk a lot less naughty, "No Sex and the City" is a bizarre compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEX AND THE CITY Tuesday, 10 p.m., TBS</p>
