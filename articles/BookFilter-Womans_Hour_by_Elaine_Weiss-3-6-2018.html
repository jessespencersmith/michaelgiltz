                <p>Home |Register |Sign In Home Top Picks: All Books The Woman’s Hour The Woman’s Hour The Great Fight to Win the Vote by Elaine Weiss Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: March 06, 2018 Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast) From the Publisher: The nail-biting climax of one of the greatest political battles in American history: the ratification of the constitutionalamendment that granted women the right to vote. "Anyone interested inthe history of our country's ongoing fight to put its founding values into practice--as well as those seeking the roots of current political fault lines- -would be well-served by picking up The Woman's Hour ." --Margot Lee Shetterly, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Hidden Figures Nashville, August 1920.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thirty-five states have ratified the Nineteenth Amendment, twelve have rejected or refused to vote, and one last state is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all comes down to Tennessee, the moment of truth for thesuffragists, after a seven-decade crusade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The opposing forces includepoliticians with careers at stake, liquor companies, railroad magnates, anda lot of racists who don't want black women voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then there are the "Antis"--women who oppose their own enfranchisement, fearing suffrage will bring about the moral collapse of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They allconverge in a boiling hot summer for a vicious face-off replete with dirtytricks, betrayals and bribes, bigotry, Jack Daniel's, and the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following a handful of remarkable women who led their respective forces into battle, along with appearances by Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding,Frederick Douglass, and Eleanor Roosevelt, The Woman's Hour is aninspiring story of activists winning their own freedom in one of the lastcampaigns forged in the shadow of the Civil War, and the beginning of the great twentieth-century battles for civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

What We SayShare This Book About The Author Elaine Weiss Elaine Weiss is an award-winning journalist and writer whose work has appeared in The Atlantic , Harper's , The New York Times , and The Christian Science Monitor , as well as in reports and documentaries for NationalPublic Radio and Voice of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A MacDowell Colony Fellow and Pushcart Prize Editor's Choice honoree, she is also theauthor of Fruits of Victory: The Woman'sLand Army in the Great War (Potomac Books/University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: March 06, 2018 Publisher: Viking Pages: 416 ISBN 10: 0525429727 ISBN 13: 9780525429722Countless memoirs, scholarly works and popular histories have been written about suffragettes and the ongoing fight to attain equal rights for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demanding their right to vote in the United States was only one step in that journey, but itremains a thrilling and dramatic one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HBO aired a noble miniseries about it just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This new popular history by journalist Elaine Weiss is a highly entertaining addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It smartly zeros in on the final battle for enfranchisement: the political shenanigans in Tennessee to ratify the 19th Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a ticking clock scenario: 35 states have ratified itand the rest (mostly former slave states) have rejected it or won't even bother considering the idea of women voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thatleaves Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If women don't achieve victory there, they must start from scratch and wait years or perhaps a decade or longer to garner their basic civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weiss captures the urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better still, this is often a battle between women, not women pleading with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major figures include the head of the traditional, more socially respectable suffragettemovement founded by Susan B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony and others; the fighters in the more radical wing unafraid of pickets and ACT-Upstyle stunts; and the formidable women campaigning against suffrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all here, including Bribery, heart attacks,mysterious trouble-makers, false charges, petty and un-admirable abandonment of racial justice (no one is a saint) to achieve a (partial) victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without obscuring the main narrative, Weiss offers deft histories of the movement, its racial politics, biographies of key players and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't know your suffragette timeline, you'll be on the edge of your seatuntil the very end. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "This well-researched and well-documented history reveals how prosuffragists sometimes compromised racial equality to win white women’s enfranchisement, and that, although the 19th Amendment was ratified, thereexists to this day an ongoing battle to effect universal, unrestricted suffrage."— Library Journal “Remarkably entertaining ... a timely examination of a shining moment in the ongoing fight to achieve a moreperfect union.”— Publishers Weekly , Starred and Boxed Review “Anyone interested in the history of our country’s ongoing fight to put its founding values into practice—as well as those seeking the roots of current political fault lines—would be well-served by picking up Elaine Weiss’s The Woman’s Hour .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By focusing in on the final battle in the war to win women the right to vote, told from the point of view of its foot soldiers, Weiss humanizes both the women working in favor of the amendment and those working against it, exposing all their convictions, tactics, and flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She never shies away from the complicatingissue of race; the frequent conflict and occasional sabotage that occurred between women’s suffrage activistsand the leaders of the nascent civil rights movement make for some of the most fascinating material in thebook.” —Margot Lee Shetterly, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Hidden Figures “Imaginatively conceived and vividly written, The Woman’s Hour gives us a stirring history of women's long journey to suffrage and to political influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Making bold connection with race and class, Weiss’s splendid book is as much needed today as it was in 1940 when Eleanor Roosevelt noted that men hate women withpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As every victory since the Civil War and Reconstruction faces the wrecker, The Woman’s Hour is an inspiration in the continuing struggles for suffrage, and for race and gender justice, and for democracy.—Blanche Wiesen Cook, author of the New York Times bestseller Eleanor Roosevelt Praise for Fruits of Victory "Weiss's excellent work of cross-disciplinary scholarship offers readers a unique look at how WWI changedsociety."—Booklist "Weiss effectively chronicles the birth of the WLA movement and the dedicated women behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
