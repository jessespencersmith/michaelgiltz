                <p>The Greatest George Stubbs re-emerges as the finest painter of horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Giltz BRITISH PAINTER George Stubbs (1724-1806) was blessed and cursed with the ability and desire to paint animals, es- pecially horses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His talent made him both rich and famous in his lifetime, though he was ignored at the end of his days and relatively obscure for many years after his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How could paintings of mere ani- mals be important? More strikes against him: Stubbs was a British painter when the Italians and others garnered far more study and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally most of his paintings were commissioned by landed gentry and aristocrats who wanted paint- ings of their most beloved animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite simply, they loved the paintings and the works remained within the families for' generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus, the many great works by Stubbs simply were unavailable for public view.Today, Stubbs is recognized as "the most accomplished and engaging painter of animals in the history of Western art," according to George Stubbs: A Celebration, a catalog published by the Frick Collec- tion in NewYork, where 17 works by Stubbs fiom British coUections are now on display. (Remarkably, this is the first showing for Stubbs in NewYork.) Also just out is George Stubbs, Painterby ludy Egerton (Yaie University Press), the first complete catalog of Stubbs's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Denise Allen, an associate curator at the Frick, is intrigued by Stubbs's outsider status, both in defending his choice of subject matter and in his approach to art. "He became a painter and trained as a painter before there was an academic pro- gram set up that defined what the train- ing should be," details Allen. "So Stubbs had a much broader view of what an artistt training should encompass and what were worthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaimal paint- ings were as important to him as history paintings." The emergence of Stubbs also dove, tailed with a new insight into the animal world. "Stubbs's portraits of irorses coin- cide rvith the time when natiual scientistswere beginning to think that animals ac- tuaily do have a personality, an individual character," continues Allen. "So Stubbs's ability to fcapture] the individual charac- ter of, say, a horse and aiso its state of mind is part of his time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he did it bet- ter than anybody else." Indeed, look closely at his work and vou will discover not iust an anatomical exactness that is remarkable, but an emo- tional attention both to the animals and their surroundings."In Molly Longlegs, he mzrnages to shou-just by characterizing the horse itself-that she's finished her exercise because her veins are firll and her ears are flipped back arrd her eyes are rolling and her tongue is hanging out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's panting," notes Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His attention to detail-which led to Stubbs's being pilloried as a mere anatomist-is revealed in striking flow- irtg manes, in the genuine intelligence and awareness of all the animals he painted and other less obvious impres- sions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aly lover of riding and competi- tion will see the seemingly placid Nerv- market Heath With A Rubbing-Down House and immediateiy sense how Stubbs captured the erpectant hush of a racetracl&lt; before an event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorne of the paintings include the name of the horses emblazoned on them, even though Stubbs himself often didn't sign his works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adds A-llen, "The owner probably asked for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We know, for in- stance, that some of the horse portraits were done the year the horse was retired from racing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So they were portraits that commemorated the horse's career and also announced they were on the market for breeding." Quiet study is rewarded with Stubbs as with all great painters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The insouciant groom in A Grey Hunter with a Groom and a Greyhound at Creswell Crags is amusing; the fear and shock inA HorseFrightened by a Lion is almost visceral, and the sense of being in the presence of creatures that demand and deserve our attention re- mains constant throughout his works. "He did vary his subject matter and he did attempt to do history painting from time to time," concludes Allen. "But he never lost sight of his own talent."
