(After a rough first scene in which she has toact especially silly, Waterston shines nicely.) The comic relief is bearable, though my guest enjoyedit more than I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the modest revelation was Ariel, performed by Angel Desai with warmth andhumanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then, of course, there's Caliban (Nyambi Nyambi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caliban is the black Shylock of Shakespeare's canon and this production doesn't try to elide or avoid it but simply accepts the ugly attitudes ofProspero as they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This makes for some of Patinkin's best moments since a straightforward Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Variety's Marilyn Stasio says: "Mandy Patinkin has a beautiful voice, as warm and golden as honey spooned from a jar -- the perfect voice to sing us through "The Tempest," the most musical of Shakespeare's late plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toplined by Patinkin's commanding Prospero, this Classic StageCompany production slips through some earthbound staging constraints to soar on the lyricalwings of the play's poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One might carp about certain visuals or cringe from the slapstick comedy, but what a joy to hear every line enunciated -- and understood -- by a cast whose ears are attuned to the music of the spoken word." The New Yorker's HIlton Als says: "The only actors who seem to connect are Waterston and Sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the lovely scene in Act III when Ferdinand professes his love, we're given a glimmer of what this production might have been had all the actors interacted: a kind of homage to forgiveness." The New York Post's Frank Scheck gave the show 3 out of 4 stars and says: "As the sorcerer Prospero, [Patinkin] delivers Shakespeare's poetry with lilting vocal cadences and swirling hand movements in what isn't so much a dramatic performance as a musical recital....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While not exactlymagical, this is a "Tempest" that makes some pretty notes." The Associated Press's Jennifer Farrar says: "From the first thunderclap to the final soliloquy, this "Tempest" is a triumph that will please all lovers of Shakespeare and good theater." She calls the production "eloquent" and says of Patinkin, "[He] exudes glowering, simmering forcefulness evenin tender moments with Miranda, who is sweetly portrayed with ethereal innocence by ElizabethWaterston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patinkin doesn't merely act as Prospero, he seems to become Prospero, seething withrepressed rage and hubris at his power and sudden chance for revenge." Theatermania's Dan Bacalzo says, "Mandy Patinkin's portrayal of Prospero in Classic Stage Company's revival of The Tempest is ill-conceived, at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actor evidences blatant disregard for Hamlet's advice to the Players by sawing the air with his hands, and generally indicating hischaracter's intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lowers his voice to growl the majority of his lines, and while his brusquedemeanor is occasionally funny, it also lacks dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, that's not the only problem thatafflicts Brian Kulick's haphazard staging of Shakespeare's grand play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main difficulty is that theproduction lacks a coherent vision."
