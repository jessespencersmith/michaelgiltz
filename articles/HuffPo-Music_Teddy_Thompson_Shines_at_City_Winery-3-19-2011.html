Thompson's mordant wit was on full display at City Winery for an acoustic show that ran a substantial 2 hours and 10 minutes but still left many of his best tunes waiting to be played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His dry humor was a constant, from claiming he walked up to drunken Irish people in Times Square on St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patrick's Day tosay, "No, I WON'T kiss you" to describing what was happening across the street during the concert (thestage faces the audience and behind them huge windows looking out on Varick so anyone performingenjoys a backdrop of taxis and pedestrians).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course repeated jokes about his lack of album sales.When Thompson commented on his inability to remember some of the lyrics to his new songs, a fanshouted out that he could fake it and they wouldn't notice. "Because you haven't bought the album," shotback Thompson. "Sales reflect that," he added when people dissented. "Don't worry about me; I'm rollingin it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil money!" It's only a small exaggeration to say people come to hear Thompson as much for hishumorous patter as his music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there was plenty of music to enjoy, from the rollicking "Looking For A Girl" to "Delilah" and "Over and Over" and "Home" and "Gotta Have Someone," all from his excellent new album Bella .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As on this in- studio performance for WNYC's SoundCheck, Thompson performed solo with just an acoustic guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can stream all the songs from Bella via his page on MySpace, but you might as well buy the album now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It gets better and better with every listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show was billed as Teddy Thompson &amp; Friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without resisting the urge to put himself down (he has no friends, suggests you be nice to friends and co-workers because someday you might need their help, etc.) Teddy then called up Rufus Wainwright to duet on "King of The Road," the Roger Miller classicthey performed on the soundtrack to Brokeback Mountain. ( Here's an amusing video of them doing it in the UK accompanied by ukulele. ) Despite holding the lyrics in his hand, Rufus bungled some of the lyrics (which he seems to always do on this song), but it only added to the casual, friendly air of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their voices blend together so well, you can't help thinking they should do a duets album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the same thought crosses your mind when Teddy sang a few songs with Jenni Muldaur, one of his favorite singers Striking Distance Of Obama Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

"Isn't that convenient?" he joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then you thought it again when he sang a few duets with Tift Merritt, making her laugh by inserting a few jokes into their cover of the Everly Brothers classic "(Til) I Kissed You." She sang, "You don't realize what youdo to me" and he tossed in, "Yes, I do." The truth is that singing duets is just one more of the many talents Thompson possesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps his natural air of modesty makes him ideal for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he's always been good at playing well with others; someone go check his school records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or maybe it's just that talented singers like to work with someone as gifted as him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever the reason, we came to see Thompson but his friends made the evening at the City Winery all the more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now how will he top it at the Rubin Museum on March 25? There's something he can agonize over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; P.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't try the specially blended Teddy Thompson red they offered that night, but it too will probably only get better with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CDS OF THE WEEK: CD #1 Ladysmith Black Mambazo -- Songs From A Zulu Farm CD#2 David Wax Museum -- Everything Is Saved CD#3 Adele -- 21 CD #4 The Low Anthem -- Smart Flesh CD #5 Ron Sexsmith -- Long Player Late Bloomer CD # 6 Simon and Garfunkel -- Bridge Over Troubled WaterCD #7 Teddy Thompson -- Bella SOME BEST CDS OF THE YEAR/DECADE LISTS: THE BEST CDS OF 2010THE BEST CDS OF THE 2000s THE BEST CDS OF 2009 THE BEST CDS OF 2007Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of CDs or digital downloads by numerous labels toconsider for review and feature coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee any coverage in exchangefor these CDs and indeed receives far more albums than he ever comes close to covering in his variousoutlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com His Relationship Status READ MORE Royal Wedding Guest ListRevealed: Who's Going?
