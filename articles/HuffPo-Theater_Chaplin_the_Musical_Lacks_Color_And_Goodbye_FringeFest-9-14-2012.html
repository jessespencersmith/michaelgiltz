It's all in an emotional vacuum unlike say Hugh Jackman's triumph in the awful musical The Boy From Oz, where he somehow managed to let everyone forget the by-the-numbers show he was appearing in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it is a strong performance and it will be interesting to see if and how he succeeds in something actually good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story begins with Charlie's hardscrabble childhood featuring a drunken father and a mother who fell ill and lost her music hall job, her mind and her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like all artists, Charlie is rather self-obsessed so wesee their painful parting but don't even find out he has a brother till years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's Sydney, playedwith a modest voice and a genuine warmth that marks Wayne Alan Wilcox as another talent that shouldMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Mourdock On Abortion: Pregnancy From Rape Is 'Something God Intended' Was The Whole Donald Trump Announcement A Gigantic, Pointless Bust?

(The splash of color at the finale was appreciated intellectually but didn't have quite the pow it should have emotionally.) Similarly, the wig and hair design by Paul Huntley ages McClure subtly throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set design by BeowulfBoritt (great name!) and video projection design by Jon Driscoll work nicely at certain key moments,such as the reenactments of filming those classic shorts (a set piece that is over too soon) and Chaplin'sfirst experience watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's a curious, circus-like theme that keeps reappearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus virtually all of the songs (by Christopher Curtis, who teamed with Thomas Meehan on the book) are interchangeable and forgettable.That leaves little for director and choreographer Warren Carlyle to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big numbers appear and have literally no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why does act one end with a bunch of Tramp impersonators? To remind us that Chaplin was world famous? We know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To tell us even in a crowd of Tramps he's still alone? Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of this is really hinted at in the number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just a spectacle with the Tramps dancing around the stage and bits of business tossed out and then it's over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act Two should have more of a drive to it since it actually features some conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper is so annoyed that Chaplin won't give her an interview that she decides to drag him down,dogging the entertainer with accusations of communism (he makes her job easier by repeatedlyaddressing communist rallies) and hedonism (all those young brides and lovers) until it finally sticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inthe show, Chaplin is driven out of the US in shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In real life, it's a little more accurate to say he stormed off, annoyed that anyone would question the great artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, exile overseas when you have millions and live like a king is hardly the sort of trying experience most people can identify with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JennColella is good as Hopper and makes the most of her big number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, she is singing a songthat echoes lines that have been used repeatedly throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sells it but we've alreadyheard it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael McCormick is good as producer Mack Sennett and numerous other parts, but they're allgone too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't blame the director for throwing the kitchen sink at this story and filling up the stage whenever possible with all sorts of diving and hoops and pratfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't blame the cast that gave their all,especially McClure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, Chaplin had an exciting life but that alone doesn't mean you've got a compelling reason to tell his story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What about him excites you? What about his life intrigues you? Why his particular story and in what particular way are you going to tell it to make it come to life? In the second act, Chaplin says he refuses to make another movie until he's had a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The people behindChaplin should have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, he's world famous even now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if they had an idea (however misguided) about how to tell his life story in a unique and meaningful way, I have no idea what it was.I don't think they do either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson's Lady Troubles &amp; More Allred Goes To Court Over Mitt Romney Divorce Testimony Former Navy Secretary Sides With Obama On Ships DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Chip Davis Halloween Is a Night Like No Other Tavis Smiley The Top 20 (Cause 10 Ain’t Enough) Reasons (Excuses) Black Folk Will Give if Obama Loses MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 Buy a link here Sponsored Links Franchise Opportunities Want to Start Your Own Business?
