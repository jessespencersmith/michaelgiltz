That's the plot ffi of the new comedy "You Don't Mess With the Zohan," which opens Friday. lt sounds absurd $$ - not even a top secret agent could survive the pressure of coloring, bobbing and styling the sN Nhair of Manhattan's fussiest, most demanding clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Hollywood specializes in fantasy, and a great hair stylist is as much of a hero to the desperately needy as any secret agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some of Hollywood's favorite hair-care specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHAMPOOO9TS) BARBERSHOP(2OO2&gt;THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE (2OOr) Wash, rinse, repeat: Barbers are like bartenders - they seem to know everyone's se- crets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Billy Bob Thornton has some secrets of his own: His wife is sleeping with a business-man and Thornton is none too pleased about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Split ends: Some people should stick to cutting hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thornton's plan to blackmail his wife's lover and open a dry cleaning store gets as messed up as a bad coloring job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didn't he realize this story was in black and white? MichaelGiltz Washi rinse, rcpeat Warren Beatty proved once and for all that there's nothing sexier for a woman than a man who can instinctively give her the perfect new hairstyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spllt ends: Not even Beatty can talk his way out of sleeping with the wife, daughter and mis- tress of a potential backer for his own salon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limp hair and a limp wrist won't cut it any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SWEENEYTOOD:THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET (2OO7)Wash, rinse, repeat: The black communi- ty traditionally has had only a few sanctuaries, among them the church and the barbershop. lce Gube makes a much more convincing barber than preacher; hence this hit comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Split ends: Doesn't Jesse Jackson realize you can say anything in a barbershop? Jokes about Jackson and Rosa Parks are what "Barbershop" is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEGALLY BLONDE (2OO1) Wash, rlnse, repeat: In this Gothic musical, Johnny Depp is a man on a mission - to prove he's the best barber in London and win the business of evil Alan Rickman. split ends: Depp is indeed a full-service bar- ber, providing a shave so close that you might even object - if your throat weren't already cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also has a side job providing the filling for some lovely meat pies.Wash, rlnse, repeat: When Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) needs a safe place to get away from the stress of Harvard Law School, she heads to a beauty salon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Split ends: Waiting there for her is mentor and friend Jennifer Coolidge with a shoulder to cry on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if only someone could help Coolidge make a delivery to the hot UPS man,</p>
