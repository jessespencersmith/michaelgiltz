Posted May 21, 2008 | 07:21 AM (EST) Read More: American Idol , American Idol 2008 , Andrew Lloyd Webber , Clive Davis, David Archuleta , David Cook , Fox , Paula Abdul , Randy Jackson , Reality TV, Ryan Seacrest , Simon Cowell , Entertainment News That's the safest headline I'll ever write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show's producers may have told us it's been a lotcloser than we believed (with only one millionvotes separating the Davids two weeks ago), butthis is what I think: a tie goes to Archuleta.Archuleta needs to stumble or Cook needs to beunbelievable if Cook wants to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOW OPENER -- The "Let's get ready to rumble" guy introduces the two Davids, who come out in full boxing gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This sets a boxing theme for the night, which is amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It certainly wouldn't have worked for Ruben Studdard and Clay Aiken but it works here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, this means they get to nickname Archuleta "Babyface." In talking about past winners, they flashed Daughtry's face even though he didn't even make the finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon gives them one bit of typical advice: "You've got to have a desire to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you've got to hate your opponent." DAVID COOK -- Clive Davis, legendary label head, chooses U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For," which makes Cook visibly pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a great choice -- yearning, rocking but not with the typical Cook formula of building up to a big finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He looks very confident and his voicesounds great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook stays right with the song, not revamping it or trying to mutate it into somethingbut just delivering it straight until the last note when he soars up a bit very effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very, verygood start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy offers a tiny caveat and gets the year wrong (it's 2008, dawg), but praises him.Paula takes us to church, saying, "David Cook has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amen." Simon calls it"phenomenal." DAVID ARCHULETA -- Clive Davis chooses Elton John's "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me," another very good choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archuleta -- who Ryan Seacrest will call "little David" and "Archie," among other nicknames -- begins by sitting on some steps, which means the fans will get to squeal Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

"Oh my gosh," says Archuleta, who seems on theverge of tears and/or nervous exhaustion the entire night (but in a cute, puppy-ish way).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simongives round one to Archuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID COOK -- In a twist, the contestants are allowed to choose among the top songs submitted for the show's season-ending tune. (However, they apparently don't get to choose the actual winner, which will be unveiled Wednesday night.) Cook chooses a pop-ish rocker called "DreamBig," which has the usual inspirational lyrics ("But if you don't dream big, what's the use ofdreaming?") but a pretty solid melodic hook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's certainly the most rockin' original Idol tune (relatively speaking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bar is pretty low, but I'd say it's the best Idol tune and a not-bad single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also shows off a poppier side to Cook and again avoids his standard formula all season, which Iassume he's saving for the final song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID ARCHULETA -- He chooses a far more typical Idol original, "In This Moment," an inspirational ballad with some truly goofy lyrics about looking at your own image in a mirror and wondering how the mirror can reflect perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew Lloyd Webber actually mocks the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's in Archuleta's wheelhouse -- this was always the round that should have been easier for him -- and he gets to end on a big note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, both guys are in great voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy, Paula and Simon all rave, with Simon saying round two goes to Archuleta, just like round one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time, I agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID COOK -- The contestants can choose any song they want as their last number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of picking a greatest hit, Cook boldly decides to do a new tune, Collective Soul's "The World I Know." On the plus side, you won't be compared to your best performance of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you get tocreate a new memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook plays an acoustic guitar and I'm expecting a build-up to a big emofinale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, it's a soft, quiet tune and ends on a gentle note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On its own, this was a goodperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Cook went the entire night without ever delivering the emo rocker rave-up stylethat got him to the finals in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it's over, Cook wells up with emotionand cries for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy praises him; Paula, who has been in full-on blurb mode the entirenight, says "You're standing in your truth;" and Simon compliments Cook by saying he's "one ofthe nicest and most sincere" contestants they've ever had and says it was a good performance ofthe tune but absolutely the wrong song choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon says Cook should have performed "BillieJean" or "Hello" and he's right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless Archuleta implodes, the night is his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID ARCHULETA -- He knows what it takes to win: big notes at the end of the songs and play to your strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So no surprise that Archuleta chooses John Lennon's "Imagine," easily his most praised performance of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, you'll be compared to your peak on theshow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But assuming he doesn't go dreadfully wrong, he'll win it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archuleta again begins in themiddle of the tune -- I'll bet you during his entire career that he NEVER sings the lines "Imagineno religion, it's easy if you try/ No hell below us, above us only sky." He goes for a little more soulthis time out and doesn't match his first shot at it, which was simpler and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it'sgood and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy anoints him the winner, Paula praises him too, and Simon says"Tonight we've witnessed one of the great finales" and awards Archuleta a knock-out, to keep withthe boxing theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As usual, Simon is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a very solid finale, with both performers in great voice and neither one really stumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of all, it was only one hour long, so the show wasn't needlessly padded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go here to watch their performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a tie goes to Archuleta and it wasn't even a tie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surprisingly, after going again and again to the formula of starting off quietly and building to a big rocking finale all season long, Cook had three songs tonight and didn't do it once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why avoid the schtick that got you to the finals? But he shouldn't have any regrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Archuelta would have won anyway with the performances he gave and Cook made a good case for himself as a real performer (a better one, to me, than he'd made since breaking out with "Hello").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So they both win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the new American Idol winner is David Archuleta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you agree?

Iactually got to the point when he was singing when I couldn't even look at him at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My prediction isthat he won't even sell as well as Reuben and his only career will be singing for Disney movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I knowhe has talent, but in my book, he's utterly forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook has a bright future and can only soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of all the contestants this season, he could be a star and really be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish him great success, and I'm just sorry he didn't choose different songs for the finale - that being said, he will have much greater artistic freedom - not as AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of luck, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm also hoping to see good things for Michael Johns, Carly Smithson, and Jason Castro. bakersdozen See Profile I'm a Fan of bakersdozen permalink Archuleta has a very pure and mature voice for someone so young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'll have to work hard to develop some personality to back up the pyrotechnics, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he constantly looks like he's in a state ofterror, which is very unappealing and unnerving to observe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regardless of what one thinks of Idol,getting through the process to this point must be an exercise in sheer endurance, so bravo to both ofthem. kellygrrrl See Profile I'm a Fan of kellygrrrl permalink you're probably right, Arch will win.... but I can't help but feel that in a few years we're going to witness a Britneyesque Breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook will have a great career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think he's going to be a great songwriter and performer. mellene See Profile I'm a Fan of mellene permalink It's too bad that David Cook's songs weren't so good last night as I believe he'd be the better "idol".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, saying that, Archleta's first song by Bernie Taupin was incredibly good but I think the praisefor the other two songs that he sang weren't warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mohaski See Profile I'm a Fan of Mohaski permalink I don't even think Archuleta should have been in the final 4, and last night just re-inforced my personalopinion that while the kid has a technically good voice, he doesn't have a very distinguished or soulfulvoice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, he doesn't have much of a personality when all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the only thing thatmight help him have a career that makes it into the next decade is his dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, what is there tokeep the tween girls who will crown him tonight from following him into adulthood? He's this year's flavor, and a rather vanilla flavor at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 09:10 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:47 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:22 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:24 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:19 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:25 PM on 05/21/2008 Posted 02:12 PM on 05/21/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Finals: David Wins It All! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-finals_b_102805.html [4/5/2009 2:20:43 PM] ElitistWhitePerson See Profile I'm a Fan of ElitistWhitePerson permalink Archie is not worthy of John Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never has been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit when he sang last night.Even so, he is so perfectly ready-made for the Idol mold, that he could win and I will not loose sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ialso will not ever buy a record of his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SharonB See Profile I'm a Fan of SharonB permalink "I threw up in my mouth " I will be so glad when this goes to the cliche grave yard and lies down beside of "groovy" and "twenty three skidoo"! DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink PS Re last week's rant, Michael, my issues with HuffPost have nothing to do with aesthetic of site; I'vealways been a huge fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My problems are purely technical in nature, with extreme difficulty navigatingthe bloated, ad-filled, links-linked site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it's a Mac thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it's my browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's damn frustrating and I never had this problem in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes two or three times longer to access blogs and the text seems to be constantly shifting around as other links pop up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major drag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LRM216 See Profile I'm a Fan of LRM216 permalink Young David is talented, no doubt, I just can't stand his sappy, giggling/crying personality. tdeg See Profile I'm a Fan of tdeg permalink dialidol has Cook crushing Archuleta and quite frankly the EW coverage said it best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many peoplewere going to change their minds on who they were going to vote for based on last night'sperformance? I don't think the fact that Archuleta technically had a better night will make a lick of difference. kristineIA See Profile I'm a Fan of kristineIA permalink I agree, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though I don't think it would have mattered if David Cook had done his thing; eleven- and twelve-year-olds generally text faster than normal human beings, so Archuleta was alwaysgoing to win it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was so hoping that Cook would rock his face off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buffy57 See Profile I'm a Fan of Buffy57 permalink I absolutely agree.Though I had a visceral visual of John Lennon rolling over in his grave, then reaching out to smack the little rat bastard DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink Seriously!! ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What's with Simon's unbridled outrage directed at stoner Jason for having theaudacity to attempt an uber-ersatz version of a Bob Marley tune (he practically accusedJason of sacrilege) but nary a whiff of complaint from Simon or any one else for youngDavid's deliberate mangling of the lyrics to "Imagine." It's one thing to dispose of the whole inconvenient "no religion" verse, which is bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's entirely another to rewrite the line "I hope someday you'll join us" with "TAKE MY HANDand join us." (There was at least one other less egregious rewrite that escapes my memory now.) Personally, I would much rather hear David A. slur his way through forgotten lyrics to "We Can Work It Out" (everyone performer forgets words now and then during performance) Favorite Flag as abusive Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:10 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:25 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:39 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:31 PM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 11:15 AM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:51 AM on 05/21/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:59 AM on 05/21/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Finals: David Wins It All! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-finals_b_102805.html [4/5/2009 2:20:43 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry than listen to a 17-year-old (or his dad) redo them to suit a particular occasion or a religious doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were many similar "mistakes" in the Beatle-themed shows several weeks back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no excuse for botching the lyrics -- either out of laziness or, especially, deliberately -- of suchubiquitous, iconic, and universally heralded material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Watch The Idol Performances Free!
