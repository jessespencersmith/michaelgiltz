                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 0 7 , 2 0 0 5BREAKING: Cheney Was Shopping For AMansion While Disaster Struckby Michael in New York on 9/07/2005 12:33:00 PMApparently, Condi Rice wasn't the only one who decided thatthe worst natural disaster in our country's history was theperfect time to go shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rice, of course, was spotted onFifth Avenue paying reportedly thousands of dollars on a pair ofFerragamo shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheney stayed on vacation while HurricaneKatrina struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He stayed on vacation on Monday and Tuesdayand Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and he was finallyspotted back in Washington on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was such a grossdereliction of duty that even liberal bloggers struggled for areasonable explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely Cheney was deathly ill andsimply incapable of doing what any decent human being woulddo during such a terrible disaster? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maureen Dowd saysCheney was house-hunting:The vice president has at long last lumbered back from aWyoming vacation, and, reportedly, from shopping for a$2.9 million waterfront estate in St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael's, aretreat in the Chesapeake Bay where Rummy has aweekend home, where "Wedding Crashers" was filmed andwhere rich lobbyists hunt.Dick Cheney was SHOPPING FOR A MANSION DURING THE WORSTNATURAL DISASTER IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If thisisn't the first question for any government official who gives astatement to the press until we get some answers, the MSM shouldjust pack up and go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I now apologize for bending backwards toassume Cheney was ill -- perhaps from his weak heart -- and offeringmy heartfelt thoughts for his family while insisting he'd have to stepdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I made the rookie mistake of assuming Cheney had a heart.NOTE: Now what do I say? The Washington Post did a story onCheney house hunting on Chesapeake Bay on Monday, a week afterthe hurricane struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It quoted people saying the deal would closeyesterday or today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How could The Washington Post CONCEIVABLY doa light, fluffy article about Cheney buying a mansion when he wasAWOL during the worst natural disaster in our nation's history? Whyaren't they demanding to speak to Cheney? Why aren't they askingfor a complete itinerary of everything he did last week while thewaters were rising and people were dying? Why aren't they askingCheney about the grotesque contrast of him buying a mansion afterhundreds of thousands of people watched their entire lives washaway and Cheney did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTHING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How could the WashingtonPost run an article like this in this context? It seems there is no reportof Cheney literally shopping for his home last week, but who knows?The Washington Post didn't ask and they used the facts to run a"cute" feature instead of recognizing his insulting refusal to get towork when this country needed him most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Write the Washington Postwith your opinion of them running a story like this two days afterCheney FINALLY was spotted at the White House and let them knowwhat questions you want answered. letters@washpost.com MORE POSTS ABOUT: KATRINA Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Tonight's crew ofRescue Rangers were vcmvo2, grog, dopper0189,shayera, and joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the meantime, dadanationlooked editorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh yeah, a big shout ...3 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsPalin's Next Step Is Still A Mystery - Sarah Palinwill enter uncharted political waters when sheleaves the Alaska stage Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the questionis whether she will go on to become...3 minutes ago FiredoglakeLate Night: MSNBC – Will Any RepublicanDenounce Rush Limbaugh? - I sure do remember atime when the GOP made Barack Obama denounceJeremiah Wright, insisting that if he didn't it wasan explicit endorsement of anything W...48 minutes ago Crooks and LiarsC&amp;L's Late Nite Music Club - Friday Night Ripoffswith Green Day and Chicago - Title: Brain Stew vs.25 or 6 to 4 Artist: Green Day vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chicago Chicago- 25 or 6 to 4 Green Day - Brain Stew This is thethird post in a series called ...48 minutes ago AMERICAblog GayE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Harris Dies - NYT: E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lynn Harris, thebest-selling author of novels that addressedquestions of identity and sexuality among blackmen, has died, his publicist told Th...3 hours agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: BRE...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/breaking-cheney-was-sh... 1 of 57/25/09 12:19 AMA M E R I C A B L O G T V Visit our AMERICAblog TV site.see all 329 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod Southern Poverty LawCenter calls on CNN to A two minute explanationof the warped and cynical The economy is better.But....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge order San Diego toget rid of the seals Massive brawl in SouthKorean parliament Mormons may havesecretly baptizedNext 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: BRE...http://www.americablog.com/2005/09/breaking-cheney-was-sh... 2 of 57/25/09 12:19 AMEzra KleinTab Dump4 hours agoWonk RoomF-22 Killed BySeven-Meme Voltron4 hours agoNYCeveHuge victories: Maloney&amp; Pingree - Health CareHeroes, Clyburnreceives petition - video5 hours agoDaily DoseWill Doctors in theHouse, SenateInfluence Debate?6 hours agoThe TreatmentDoes the GOP ReallyHave an AlternativePlan in the Works?6 hours agoG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
