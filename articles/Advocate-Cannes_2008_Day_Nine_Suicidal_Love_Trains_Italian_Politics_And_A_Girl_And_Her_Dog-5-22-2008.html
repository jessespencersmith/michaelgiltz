                <p>May 22, 2008Cannes Day Nine: Suicidal Love, Trains,Italian Politics and A Girl and Her DogThe Frontier of Dawn -- I'm a little shaky on the Englishlanguage title of this French film, which is properly called "LaFrontiere De L'aube." It's directed by Philippe Garrel and starshis son Louis Garrel in the gloriously disastrous, deeply Frenchstory of a photographer, the doomed starlet he falls in love withand the romance that haunts him -- literally -- for the rest of hislife The starlet is married, but her husband is away and this isFrance so of course she and the aspiring photographer makesweet love -- in glorious black and white; if nothing else the filmdoes look beautiful, in a New Wave sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her husbandreturns; they break up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her husband leaves; she begs him toreturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she drinks and takes drugs and is mad, I tell you,mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would he still love her if she were mad? He doesn'tanswer but she forces the question by going really mad andburning down her apartment and being institutionalized whereelectro-shock therapy is quickly resorted to. (It has made acomeback, but I doubt it's the first step for beautiful youngactresses with substance abuse problems.) She tries to escapewith him and is eventually released...only to commit suicide inthe most glamorous way imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One year later, he is aboutto get serious with another girl when the actress starts hauntinghim, literally popping up in mirrors to the sound of a bong-ingdeath knell that sent the critics over the edge with derisivelaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It only got worse, for the most booed film since"Serbis." This one is even more lamentable since it has suchtalent involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a moment of praise for Louis Garrel, thecurrent It Boy of French cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With his mop of curly hair andcraggy, awkwardly beautiful looks, he is a magnetic movie star.I'm not quite convinced he's an actor yet, because every roleseems a variation on the same verbal, wounded, dangerouslycharming young man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But how else would you cast him at thisyoung stage of his career?Visit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement CategoriesBingham Cup 2008BooksCannes 2008Cannes Film FestivalCelebsCoachellaComic-Con 2007Current AffairsFashionFilmAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-day-nine.html 1 of 57/22/09 4:14 PMO'Horten -- After a Che press conference and rushing home towrite up my manifesto -- I mean my article -- I move on to"O'Horten," a charming trifle by the director of "KitchenStories." I'd missed the first screening and while no oneclaimed greatness for this tale of a train engineer who retiresand is immediately thrown for a loop by the lack of structure inhis life, most everyone said it was welcome light entertainment.They were right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baard Owe is a stone-faced delight as OddHorten, the retiring train engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scene where his fellowworkers give Odd a goodbye party sets the tone nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theystand up, move their arms in a "chugging train" motion, maketrain noises and then all toot their horns in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then theysit around and identify trains by audio recordings of them orguess the number of bridges between such and such a city.(372? I could have sworn it was 371!) Who said train spottersweren't fun? Odd's odd adventures soon include stumbling intoan apartment where a little boy holds Odd hostage for the nightby threatening to wake up his parents, falling asleep in a saunaand having to leave in high heels, and spending time with aneccentric ambassador who insists he can drive around townblindfolded and never hit anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sweet, gentle, with notes ofmelancholy (did I mention it's Norwegian?), this film by BentHamer is straightforward, unassuming entertainment.Il Divo -- One of the most admirable traits of Cannes is loyaltyand patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, that means having to sit through the latestWim Wenders movie, even if he hasn't made a truly good filmin 20 years (obviously, I'm referring to his masterpiece "Wingsof Desire" from 1987).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also means sticking with youngtalent like James Gray and Kelly Reichardt (who will both comethrough some day with great films, I'm sure of it) and Italiandirector Paolo Sorrentino, who has come through right nowwith both guns blazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Between this and Gomorrah, Italy sureseems like a corrupt, violent place -- but as long as the moviesare this entertaining, it can't be all bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I first heard aboutSorrentino when he made "The Consequences of Love," a filmthat was technically beautiful and had a strong centralperformance by Toni Servillo but was basically inertemotionally. "Friend of the Family," a film about a stingymoney lender that also impressed, also played the fest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butneither prepared me for this ballsy, hyper-confident dramaabout Italian politics, a world so complicated the movie actuallybegins with a glossary of terms like "Red Brigade." But then thefun begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like "GoodFellas," Sorrentino is on fire here, usingevery trick in the book -- freeze frame, slow motion, wackycamera angles, graphics -- to introduce a seemingly endlessstream of characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of pop music is also stunning,Film FestivalsFood and DrinkIowa Caucus 2008LesbianMusicOutfest 2008PartiesPoliticsProvincetown Film Festival 2008Queen Mary 2 Historic CrossingReligionScienceSexSportsSydney Mardi Gras 2008Taylor Hanson for The AdvocateTelevisionThe DinahThe HRC Logo ForumThe L WordTheaterTravelRecent PostsMTV Video Music Awards...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheap, Or What?Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles: 30 Years YoungEric McCormack Auctions Off Porsche for ProjectAngel FoodWhat is the Advocate Insider?

"Pulp Fiction," "GoodFellas," "ThreeKings" -- those are all supremely entertaining movies whosedirectors seemed to have an endless supply of "tricks" on thosefilms to deliver their stories in fresh, exciting ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what"Il Divo" feels like to me, crowned with Servillo's brilliantly stillperformance at the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when he's given an explosivefive minute monologue to defend himself (or confess), it'sshatteringly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even people who like it seem to think it'llnever play outside of Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I don't know a damn thing aboutItalian politics and I thought it was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is everything"Che" failed to be: a biopic that used a slice of a controversialfigure's story to bring him to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bursting with memorablecharacters and incident, you get a complete feel for the manand his world and want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I defy most people whosaw "Che" to even describe some of the fighters who stood byChe's side in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I read an 800 page biography and still hadtrouble telling them apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so, here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually the best filmsat Cannes have screened by now and late Thursday and Fridayare saved for the dregs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank goodness in a weak year we gotthe pleasure of a really great movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad so many criticshave already left.Wendy and Lucy -- The night ends with a new movie by KellyReichardt, the auteur behind the indie darling "Old Joy." Iwasn't as excited by "Old Joy" as others, but I certainly thoughtit revealed a talent worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reichardt here deliversanother modest tale -- this one slightly more accessible andvimax on Awards Night: Miniskirts, Musicals, andMamaomar on Amman SegregatesArchivesSeptember 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008April 2008March 2008February 2008January 2008December 2007November 2007September 2008SunMonTueWedThuFriSat 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930 Subscribe to this blog's feedAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-day-nine.html 3 of 57/22/09 4:14 PMthus I imagine slightly less thrilling to her previous supporters.But I'll eagerly look forward to her next film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one starsMichelle Williams as a young loner who is traveling to Alaskawith her dog Lucy and hoping to work in a fishery and basicallyescape her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quiet and withdrawn, Wendy sometimes forgetsto even say thank you or offer up the other niceties that"normal" people depend on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disaster strikes quickly: her carbreaks down, she's caught shop-lifting and taken to jail andLucy has disappeared when Wendy returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dealing with allthese crises when you only have about $500 to your name andno family to speak of (a sister Wendy calls immediately andsuspiciously wonders what Wendy wants) is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothingremarkable here, but it's compelling on a scene to scene basis.And I really do love Williams -- she is truly devoted to actingand consistently appears in independent films by promisingtalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I were a young filmmaker, she'd be the first actor I'dwant to read any script I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it were good, she seemsalmost certain to say yes to appearing in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams showed upfor the debut, her first major public appearance since HeathLedger died. (She also has a role in "Synecdoche, New York,"which debuts on Friday.) She looks lovely in a vintage creamdress and pocket purse and why am I suddenly delivering afashion report when I know nothing about fashion? But I doknow a serious artist when I see one and that describes directorKelly Reichardt and actress Michelle Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope theMartin Scorsese movie she's filming ("Shutter Island," based onthe crime novel by Dennis Lehane of "Mystic River" ) gives hereven more juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll all be better off the more movies she canget made.Posted at 03:48 PM in Cannes 2008 | PermalinkTrackBackTrackBack URL for this entry:http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341ca4b653ef00e55291a4518834Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Cannes Day Nine:Suicidal Love, Trains, Italian Politics and A Girl and Her Dog:CommentsVerify your CommentPreviewing your CommentPosted by: | This is only a preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your comment has not yet been posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post Edit Your comment could not be posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Error type:Advocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-day-nine.html 4 of 57/22/09 4:14 PMYour comment has been posted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Post another commentThe letters and numbers you entered did not match the image.Please try again.As a final step before posting your comment, enter the lettersand numbers you see in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This preventsautomated programs from posting comments.Having trouble reading this image?
