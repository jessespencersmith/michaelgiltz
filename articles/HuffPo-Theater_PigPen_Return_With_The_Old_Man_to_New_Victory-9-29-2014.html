Yes it has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is fullof pirates, sea creatures, mythical cities on the horizon, fabled sailors, simple bravery (which is never thatsimple), lies that help, truth that hurts, balloonists and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's rousing, silly, sweet and bursting withgood songs, ranging from folk ballads to one awesome Tom Waits-like number that feels like an electric jolt tothe evening.12/15/2015Theater: PigPen Return With The Old Man to New Victory Theater | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=6d36e7ad-27dc-4d84-a8cc-c16487bdf6b0&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4I haven't singled out any of the PigPen members, because they truly feel like such an ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh sure, you'llhave your favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as each member dives into a new role, as three or four of them playfully jump togetherand declare they're a ship! and you think, yes of course, a ship! and they move little cut-out characters behind alit-up scrim to illustrate a character walking on a journey, you'll laugh with each and every one of them at somepoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as they raise their voices in song, you'll think this or that fellow has an especially lovely voice butalways, always they sound better, stronger and more special when their voices join in unison.Prior to this production, I'd seen them in funky venues in Brooklyn or Off Broadway settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here they areat the New Victory Theater, a jewel box of a house that is devoted to fare for family audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As anyone who'shad the pleasure to see a show at New Victory, it's a great space and their best shows would appeal to anyone.That's certainly true of this show, which runs through October 13.But just because kids can have fun, don't confuse this with a children's show that adults can enjoy too. (Not thatthere's anything wrong with that.) You might say the same of the Tony-winning show Peter and the Starcatcher,which had a similarly playful tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Old Man and the Old Moon makes perfect sense here, but it would alsofit right in at the high art stages of the Brooklyn Academy of Music or with an open run on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The onlything that doesn't make sense is missing these talented performers in action.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical ***Rodney King *** Hard Times ** 1/2 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead ** I Could Say More * The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner ** Machinal *** Outside Mullingar *** A Man's A Man * 1/2 The Tribute Artist ** 1/2 Transport ** Prince Igor at the Met ** The Bridges Of Madison County ** 1/2 Kung Fu (at Signature) ** Stage Kiss *** Satchmo At The Waldorf *** Antony and Cleopatra at the Public ** All The Way ** 1/2 The Open House (Will Eno at Signature) ** 1/2 Wozzeck (at Met w Deborah Voigt and Thomas Hampson and Simon O'Neill) Hand To God *** Tales From Red Vienna ** Appropriate (at Signature) * Rocky * 1/2 Aladdin *** Mothers And Sons ** Les Miserables *** 1/2 Breathing Time * 1/2 Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna * 1/2 Heathers The Musical * 1/2</p>
