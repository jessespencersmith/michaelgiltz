                <p>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 04, 2019 THEATER: BOO! A Halloween Scare Fest Closes Its Eyes To The Real Terror I CAN'T SEE * out of **** NIGHTMARE NYC Every year, New York City becomes haunted by scary pop-up sites of horror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the big players is Psycho Clan, the team behindNightmare (which ran for 15 years) and other hits like This Is Real, not to mention immersive shows geared towards other holidays like Full Bunny Contact and Santastical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are not your parents'haunted houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I've seen none of them or any of the shows bytheir competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? I'm a scaredy cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jump out from around acorner and yell "Boo!" and I guarantee I'll squeal and leap out of my shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am very, very easy to frighten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it began in first grade at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coleman's Catholic School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I sat in the front row of Sister Patricia'sclass, a very nice, even quiet nun who I shared a birthday with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She liked me, I was a good student and we got along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I was also easily distracted and quite the talker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I wasn't absorbed in somereading, I was chatting with the students around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when otherstudents began talking and the noise in the room reached a fever pitch,Sister Patricia had a go-to tactic of snapping us back into silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She took off her flat-heeled shoe and slammed it on a desk with a hard rap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAM! BAM! BAM! That shut us up quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And she didn't slam it onjust any desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She slammed it on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since I was alwaysthoroughly absorbed in what I was reading or saying, it invariablycaught me completely unawares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kids in the back row would jump a little in their seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Me? I hit the ceiling and my heart raced and it was a few minutes before I could catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon, I developed anervous tic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ok, not really, but I am easy to scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new show I Can't See didn't scare me in the least.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (71) ▼ October (9) THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On Shaky GroundIt's a fine conceit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You experience this show completely in the dark! They blindfold you, slap headphones onto you and you experience an auditory experience while you stumble around following "umbilicals"from one area of the room to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You take an Uber ride, stand ata bar, sit on the floor of a haunted mansion and all the while potentialhorrors are taking place all around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to the almost-full sensory experience are the sort of stunts pulled at fraternity and sorority hazings for generations. "Things" brush against you, coolbreezes blow on you, water drips at you from a leak in ceiling and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the show's best effect, someone throws up on you in that bar in a nicely warm queasy effect that of course is quickly brushed off and leaves no stains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, none of the show is well thought out or hangs together.It begins in a vaguely medical setting, where people in white lab coatsprepare you for your experience by blindfolding you and giving you a"pill" (a very tart SweetTart, I'd say) to help download the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're encouraged to follow simple rules like "Don't die," which is always good advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that doesn't quite gibe with the idea that you're going to be placed in a horror film setting -- in real life, you laugh at the people in the movie who make dumb choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, now, you'll find out what acoward you really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that doesn't work since you're not the maincharacter in the play and you never make a single choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And none of that set-up works easily with the very banal radio play taking place in the auditory portion of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ninety-ninepercent of the experience is preparation, with you and friends meetingup, hanging out at a bar, planning to spend the night in a hauntedhouse and then Ubering over to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of it is scary or particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to scare people, a radio play where you hear the iPhone ding of an incoming text or wait while anothercharacter Venmo's money to a landlord isn't going to cut it.THEATER: "The Glass Menagerie" Sans Tricks Or Trea...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Wrestling With Faith in "Heroes Of The Fo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: A Bright Future In Reach For "Chasing Rai...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: The Not-So "Great Society" THEATER: BOO!

Well, I love you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I Can't See rightly says the scariest thing in the world is your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, this work by Timothy Haskell and Paul Smithyman lacks it almost entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
