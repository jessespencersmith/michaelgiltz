                <p>OnS ~ster of His Domain W hafs wrong with this picture? Nothing, as far as Jeny Stiller's concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's starring in the Broadway comedy of the same name; radio spots written, produced, and perfonned by him and his wife, Anne Meara, continue to appear with pleasing regularity; the kids are in the business (God help them) and doing well (his son directed Reality Bites; his daughter does stand· up); and he may even squeeze in another appearance or two this year on Seinfeld if they call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How­ ever, it would be nice if his character in the play were a little younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For an earlier version of the Donald Margulies comedy, "I read for the part of the son, Alan Rosenberg's character," says Stiller. "I had no idea that I would be right for the grandfather one day." Substantially revised, What's Wrong With This PicfJJre? is ''the story of a family sitting shiva, and this hap­ pens to be my daughter· in-law [Faith Prince).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We find out everyone's feelings about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In my case, I'm a 75-year~ld ex-taxi driver whose license has been revoked, and I was in love with this woman for twenty years while she was married to my son." That's amazing, but not as amazing as what being on a hit show can do for an actor. "I'm really kind of in shock," says Stiller, who plays the father of George on Seinfeld. "People on the street give me all kinds of comments on why I'm too rough on George, why I'm not rougher on George.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A man said to me, 'What are you doing to our generation? You're making us parents look like fools.' People stop their cars in traffic to talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly your stock goes up and you're back on Broadway again." MICHAEL GILT2</p>
