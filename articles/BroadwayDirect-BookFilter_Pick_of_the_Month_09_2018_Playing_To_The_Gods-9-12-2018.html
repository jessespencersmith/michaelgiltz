                <p>Every month, BookFilter selects the best new theater book, exclusively for Broadway Direct readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing to the Gods By Peter Rader$26, Simon &amp; Schuster This dual biography tells the stories of two of the greatest stage actresses in history: Sarah Bernhardt (the Divine One, as good at self-promotion as she was at acting) and Eleanora Duse(a self-effacing artist who pioneered modern acting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s juicy and delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both women camefrom hardscrabble backgrounds, with the French Bernhardt the daughter of a courtesan and theItalian Duse the daughter of itinerant actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernhardt was a genius at marketing andmerchandising — she ran her own theater company and put her face on everything from fans toface cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her scandalous exploits were headline news all over the world and she wasdelighted, for Bernhardt played the press like an impresario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duse preferred not to speak to thepress at all, saw acting as a spiritual act, and disappeared into her roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernhardt was a star, BOOKFILTER’S SEPTEMBER PICK OF THE MONTH MICHAEL GILTZ | SEPTEMBER 12, 2018 SHARE always the same in every play; Duse was an artist, devoted to the roles and the emotions of her characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernhardt was the last of the great posers, the actors who took specific, detailed stances on stage to evoke emotions, all of it worked out in advance, all of it mechanical, and, inher case, always, always winking at the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duse was among the first of the true actorsas we understand acting today, influencing Stanislavski and his Method acting (which sheembodied even before it had a name).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These two women circled each other warily, competingfor lovers and roles, but wisely valuing the roles over lovers every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their competition peakswith an insane showdown in which they both appeared in London across the street from eachother … playing the same role in the same play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just when you’re ready to start casting the next season of TV’s Feud, author Peter Rader digs further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He shows how Bernhardt rose to the challenge of Duse and deepened her craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also gives her credit for brave public stances, such as when the Jewish Bernhardt stood tall duringthe Dreyfus Affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s all to the good for Bernhardt, since she may have won the battle (westill know her name), while Duse so clearly won the war when it came to acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rader isstrongest on the specifics of their lives, a little weaker when he steps outside the facts of thestory at hand (such as erroneously saying Marlon Brando’s appearance in A Streetcar NamedDesire was his Broadway debut; it was I Remember Mama some three years earlier, followed by four more shows before Streetcar ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who loves theater, acting in general, and strong women from history in particular will enjoy Playing to the Gods very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KEEP READING:Bookfilter’s February Pick of the MonthMean Girls on Broadway: “I’d Rather Be Me” Official Lyrics &amp; MeaningSEE ALL NEWS Join Our Newsletter General Info Find Shows Broadway Venues Come From Away Launches Book</p>
