                <p>M O N D A Y , J U L Y 2 5 , 2 0 0 5Is Supreme Court Nominee Roberts LyingAlready?by Michael in New York on 7/25/2005 06:16:00 PMJudge Roberts wants to be a Supreme Court justice, butapparently it's rude of us to expect to learn a little somethingabout him and his judicial philosophy before giving Roberts thatlifetime appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've already commented on how absurd itis that nominees are apparently supposed to pretend they'reincapable of discussing cogently and directly their views onlandmark Supreme Court decisions made 10, 20, 30 or even100 years ago -- that's something every first year law studentmust do, but apparently it's impossible for the best andbrightest minds in the country.Now we're already getting hints that Roberts and the WhiteHouse are trying to stonewall any info that points to Robertsbeing a fringe radical rather than the moderate, mainstreamjudge that most Americans want on the Supreme Court.The first snafu? The Federalist Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone is lying --either the White House or Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he was announced, itwas immediately mentioned by some press outlets that Robertsbelonged to the Federalist Society, a far right group devoted toattacking what it saw as "liberalism" on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It iscertainly a sign of someone who belongs on the fringes ofjudicial philosophy.Here's the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were immediately told Roberts wasn't amember and -- taking the White House at its word -- numerousmedia outlets ran corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Per USA Today:Roberts has acknowledged participating in Federal Societyevents and giving speeches for the organization.But on Monday, presidential press secretary ScottMcClellan said, "He doesn't recall ever paying dues orbeing a member."That's Scotty in another tight bind and saying the info came directlyfrom Roberts.But the Washington Post reported this:The Washington Post reported Monday that it had obtainedfrom a liberal group a 1997-98 Federalist Society leadershipdirectory listing Roberts, then a partner in a privatelaw firm, as being a steering committee member inthe group's Washington chapter.I'm gonna make a crazy guess and imagine that the Washingtonchapter of the Federalist Society is probably their biggest and mostinfluential one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It beggars belief that someone could be on a steeringcommittee of a group but downplay their involvement and act as ifthey'd just gone to a few functions. (Did other non-members serve onthis committee? Do they usually use outsiders who don't even belongto the Federalists on this committee? How often did he attendmeetings? How many meetings do they hold? Are there meetingsmonthly? Semi-annually? How often do most members attendmeetings? We're sure Roberts will ask the Federalist Society torelease any relevant info.) Fees or not, if you serve on a steeringcommittee, you are an ACTIVE member of that group.How does it feel to know that on the very first issue surrounding thisnominee, the White House has either been duped by their guy orknowingly spread disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps, PERHAPS it is technicallytrue that Roberts never paid dues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no one could think they wereforthcoming or honest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless it depends on what your definition of EschatonPretty Much - I think this encapsulates nicely ourmodern media environment.1 hour ago HuffPost PoliticsHuckabee's Huck Pac In Turmoil With StaffTurnover, Mounting Debts - Former Arkansas Gov.Mike Huckabee's political action committee, HuckPac, is undergoing a "restructuring," ExecutiveDirector Sarah Huckabee said Wednesday....1 hour ago Ben SmithGoing small - My story tonight: President BarackObama came alive about 50 minutes intoWednesday night’s news conference – whensomebo2 hours ago FiredoglakeLate Late Night FDL: What Eclipse? - A new videofrom Fatoumata Diawara, and and oldie from Bob.2 hours ago Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Today, srkp23(pulling a double shift), ybruti, taylormattd,ItsJessMe and vcmvo2 combed through hundredsof diaries to find this powerful list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today's...3 hours agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Is Sup...http://www.americablog.com/2005/07/is-supreme-court-nomine... 1 of 57/23/09 3:47 AMA M E R I C A B L O G T V Visit our AMERICAblog TV site.see all 322 videos &gt;I collect with vodpod The Taco Bell dog hasdied In honor of SenatorDeMint For the GOPers, healthcare is politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They just Traditional media has todebunk the birthers One small step...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The right-wing media, thevoices of the GOP, inNext 6AMERICAblog News| A great nation deserves the truth: Is Sup...http://www.americablog.com/2005/07/is-supreme-court-nomine... 2 of 57/23/09 3:47 AMThe TreatmentObama Has a Grown-UpTalk With America(Gulp)3 hours agoEzra KleinTab Dump7 hours agoWonk RoomSen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Byron Dorgan:The ‘Trade’ InCap-And-Trade ‘MakesNo Sense To Me’9 hours agoHealth BeatTruth Squad: WallStreet Journal HealthCare Editorial Wrong onthe Facts . . .10 hours agoDaily DoseProviders Endorse 'Payfor Value' ProposalsG AY P O L I T I C S Visit our new gay politicssection, AMERICAblog Gay.F E E D S Blog RSS AMERICAblog TV RSS Twitter RSSTwitter Feed Get the blog by email: Subscribe me!
