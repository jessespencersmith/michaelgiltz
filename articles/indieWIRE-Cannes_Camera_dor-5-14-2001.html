"La libertad"is a prime eKample Its debtts owed to Satyajit Ray. who knew how to tum the smallest of incidents into gripping drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer-director lisandro Alonso. however, forgot the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He simply shows a day in the life of an Argentine peasant who makes his living chopping wood alone in a forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see the man chop down wood. sell it. buy some supplies, ask the store clerk if there are any girls around (there aren't). try and visit someone who isn', around and then 90 home and cook an armadillo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alonso steadfastly avoids even the slightest of plot lines -no tree threatens to fall on our protagon ist and even the armadillo is caught off-camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Alonso manages to frame his shots with enough intelligence to keep a dedicated viewer from losing complete inl8f'est. (SEARCH) Sear." for: (DISCUSS) 2001 Mafli'C' \0 IbQrucut Youoa Film bvlfl Far more promising -and the frontrunner for the Camera O'Or after the first five days -is"Atanarjuat, The Fast Runner"{Canada), A commanding drama by documentary filmmaker Zacharias Kunuk, this nearly three-hour film tells the fable-like story about when evil comes to an Inuit village, Problems persist when Atanarjuat falls for the pretty girl promised to the mean-spirited Oki, son of the village leader, Atanarjuat gets his way, and the festering resentment of Oki leads to treachery by his two-faced sister and eventually murder, Obviously, one thinks of Robert Flaherty, but Kunuk's involving tale stands on its own -thanks to touches that embrace Inuit myths and the crystal clarity of the images captured by cinematographer Norman Cohn, It earned the emphatic, insistent applause of an audience that was convinced it had finally seen something worthwhile , No enthusiasm could be found for"Chelsea Walls,"Ethan Hawke's directorial debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A jumble of storylines, it skips back and forlh between current denizens of the Chelsea Hotel, with an all-star cast featuring Kris Kristofferson as an alcoholic writer, Miranda Richardson as his currenl name, Vincent D'Onofrio as a shy painter who tries to date Uma Thurman , and Robert Sean Leonard and Steve Zahn as struggling musicians, Shot on DV by Tom Richmond in association with Richard Rutowski, the movie embraces its muddy, rough origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the music that dominates throughout is far more interesting than any of the stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hawke's debt is to the Beatniks and it remains unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His investors are another story: the trades reported the rights to France were sold for S350.OO0, which was more than the entire budge\. "Fah Talai Jone"("Tears of the Black Tiger") was snapped up by Miramax and it's easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This fillip on Thai westerns (who knew?) has a wonderfully kitschy look thanks to a colorful production design by Ake Aimchuen and a tinted print that provides a surreal touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Ihe look of the film is the only consistent draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps Miramax can speed the storyline up with its fabled scissors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For now, wri\er-director Wisit Sasanatieng's film uncomfortably straddles the line between homage and satire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More serious and more effective is the black-humored Bosnian Competition entry"No Man's Land"by director Danis Tanovic. like most of the overtly political films at the festival, this one is heavy-handed in the extreme, but tile main story is compelling enough to overcome its forced style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two soldiers on opposite sides of Ihe '93 Bosnian connict are trapped in No Man's Land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their stand-off seems unending, with only a UN Captain willing 10 intervene (despite orders 10 the contrary).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A third soldier, thought dead, is actually trapped on top of a land . , .. -... .... , mine -~ ne moves, ne oles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I ne InternatiOnal meOla latcnes on to this story, adding to the absurd atmosphere that hopes to mack not simply this particular war, but all wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film definltely has its supporters. "Ca,"however, does not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A mildly sweet debut from Roman Coppola, he is not -as yet -prepared to follow In his slste(s footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coppola's sister, of course, is Sofia, who scored strong critical reviews and a solid art·house hit with her debut feature"The Virgin Suicides."(1t even had a great soundtrack courtesy of Air.) Roman takes the more obvious route of creating an homage to classics like"S 1f2" and"La Dolce Vita"in telling his tale of a"Barbarella"style movie shoot in '60s Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is formidable, including Gerard Depardieu and Jeremy Davies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the comparisons to those masterpieces are not favorable and, Indeed, Roman quietly mocks his own pretensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equally toothless is"Amour D'enfance"("Childhood Loves"), the uninvolving story of Paul, a man who returns to the family farm when his father is dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul also hooks up with some boring old friends he'd left behind long ago and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, his former girlfriend is out of town, but her little sister is looking better and better as the days drag on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Yves Caumon doesn't have much to work with, but he pulls an exceptional performance from Laury! Brossier as Odile, the little sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her scenes -flushing with embarrassment when Paul says he knows she had a crosh on him -are sparked with lile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caumon either has a way with female actresses or simply has a good eye for talent. but his next movie will be worth watching if only for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And certainly so will Brossie(s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The more highly anticipated movies in the Camera d'Or race have yet to screen:"lovely Rita."Jessica Hausne(s intimate look at an awkward high school girl who's ready to explore her burgeoning sexuality from Austria. and Fine line's elaborate comedy"Human Nature"directed by Michel Gondry, and written by Charlie Kaufman. that stars Tim Robbins and Patricia Arquette as scientists who wrestle with how to handle the wild child played by Rhys Ifans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the wild card in all of this is·Shrek,"the DreamWorks animated flick that played to very strong applause at the lumiere and received across-the·board raves from the trades. ("Variety"had only minor quibbles to make about the dull third act.) A distinctive looking. highly commercial effort, it tells of an ogre who must rescue a fairy princess in order to get a little peace and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly, animation has enjoyed a creative flowering in the last two decades and Cannes should reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But instead of"Beauty and the Beast.""Toy Story .. ·Chicken Run."or even"South Park: Bigger, Longer, &amp; Uncut,"they settled ",,·C::h...,.~ "Th,,"G in ... h"." ... ,,, .. f ... r&lt;onn"G , .. hi ... h I&lt;o~' f",,', ,.......t ~ .. ~ ... ~" .... ~ ...... ~ .. u.~~.~ ......................... ~ .. ~ .... ~ ...... ~ .. such lesser·animated movies like'The Fantastic Planet"and Disney's woeful"Peter Pan." While the best animated movies are RaVOfed with witty asides,"Shre k"is nothing but pop-&lt;;ulturat riffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some day. perhaps. the scene where Shrek uses wresUing moves 10 trounce his opponents to the tune of Joan Jelt's"Bad Repulation"will seem like a witty spoof on"A Knight's Tale."ln fact. il's just an example of this movie's dull heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But given the strong crowd response and the stellar reviews. the two directors (Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson) may conceivably find their fairy tale Includes a Camera d'Or fOf the happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; F"E~:E~D~B':AJ~~K~?~~~~~~::::: 'O (le"8&lt;"s to th, i iI visitlhe indieWlRE ~ p;oge.)
