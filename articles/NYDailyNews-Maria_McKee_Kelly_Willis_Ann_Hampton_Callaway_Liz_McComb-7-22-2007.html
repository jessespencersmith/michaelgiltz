                <p>MUSICN FI oz oz foin tune Four performers playing New york in the next week tell of the moment that changed everything By MTcHAEL Grlrz Maria McKee:D Early'Decembe/ The teenage sensation in the '80s band Lone Justice, McKee was build- ing a solo career at Getfen Records when she abruptly brought it all dom with the wildly scattered 1996 release "Life Is Sweet " The album effectively ended her rnajor-label career. "It's a verv dangerous path I've cho- sen," says McKee, who per-forms at Joe's Pub tomorrow and Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's talking from the tiny L.A apart- ment - one her grandmother liyed in - that McKee shares with her husband and musical paftner, Jim Akin, "I've committed commercial suicide over and over again And in some cas- es, critical suicide Some people real- ly want me to do one kind of music that I did really well when I w6 young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not an easy road, but for me, it's true " On "Life Is Sweet," McKee was ba- sicaly telling her fans: Anything can happen, wanna come along? Famous for her country-leaning Americana and a voice with real ache in it, McKee, on her new album, "Late December," tackles the Motown stomp of "No Oth- er Way to Love You" and the husky ter- rain of the title track, not to mention a yelp at the end of "Destine "'You mean my Axl Rose moment?" laughs McKee about her recorded vocal keen McKee seems certain to retum to her first love, the theater, soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has finished the first draft of a play about her relationship with her brother Bry- an Maclean, 18 years her senior, who was in the classic rock group Love be-fore burning out, being born again and then living at home while McKee was growing up and luring her from the- ater to rock 'n' roll (IWo other plays are in various stages as well.) And she's still reveling in the other turning point of her peBonal and pro- fessional life: meeting Akin, who co- writes, produces, photographs and col- laborates with her on eveMhing "I had four days to find a bass play- ef, Actually," McKee laughs, "I knew Jim's wife at the time She really, real- ly wmted to get him to join the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think she wanted to get him out of the house because she had a boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it worked out for everyone!" o (Joe's Pub, JuLy 23 ond 24; 425 Lafdyette St , 2r2-967-7555) tion," says Callaway, whose four-night stand at the Blue Note starts Thursdav to support her new CD, "Blues in lhe Night." They ended up at a scary "dive hotel," she recomts good-naturedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with her Tony-nominated tum in 1999's "Swing!" on Broadway. things changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More change is coming: She's co-writing songs for the upcoming film "State ofAffairs," and her next CD will be her first filled with originals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, the night CaUaway, 48, opens at the Blue Note, her pilot for a PBS series about the art of singing debuts on TV in her hometown of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She says her om art got kick-started when she read Bob Dylan's stream-of- consciousness novel "Taranhria" at age l2 'l guess Bob wrote it quickly," say-s Callaway drily, "but I thought it was fas- cinating, [soJ I ffiote my jomal in the same sMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; See how a kid can be cor- rupted by musicims?
