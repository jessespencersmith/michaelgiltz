                <p>Entertainment Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Follow Theater , Video , Roundabout Theatre , Athol Fugard , Broadway , Entertainment NewsReact Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Road To Mecca" Proves Bigger Is Not Always Better THE ROAD TO MECCA ** 1/2 out of **** ROUNDABOUT THEATRE COMPANY It's so difficult not to lose your shirt when producing theater that one feels churlish wishing a revival of Athol Fugard's drama The Road To Mecca were in a tinier, Off Broadway house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The American Airlines Theatre is hardly sprawling -- it's the fourth smallest house on theGreat White Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet even it feels too large for thisintimate, modest, three person drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fugard's tale is a simple one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miss Helen (the great Rosemary Harris) is an elderly widow who lives onher own in an isolated town in South Africa in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since her husband died 15 years earlier, she's beencreating what we would call folk art, fantastical (or monstrous) cement figures that fill her yard and homeuntil there's not enough room for even a radish to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We take this on faith since unlike the originalNew York production, none of those giant, disturbing sculptures are visible to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Al we see is a warm,expansive home with lots of candles, small hand-crafted works throughout, a glittering ceiling (createdwith ground-up beer bottles) and walls painted with streaks of orange and blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To us it seems warm andinviting; to her fellow Afrikaners at the time, the word they would use would be closer to unhinged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miss Helen receives an unexpected visitor -- the English South African schoolteacher Elsa (a fine Carla Gugino), an English woman of South Africa being considered inherently freer, more modern, less"traditional" than an Afrikaner like Miss Helen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are also, of course, from different generations.(This is not a play that focuses on race and prejudice, though of course every play of Fugard has suchreality woven throughout it.) Miss Helen needs Elsa's support because the local man of the cloth Marius(an excellent Jim Dale) is coming to get her signature on a consent form so Miss Helen can be movedinto an old folk's home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essentially, we spend the first half of the play hearing hints about a mysterious letter from Miss Helen, tragic events of 15 years ago, problems for Elsa and the looming, threatening appearance of Marius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inthe second half, we discover exactly what happened 15 years ago, the contents of that letter, the unhappystate of Elsa's life and a showdown where the three of them sort out their complicated feelings for oneanother.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast GOP Candidate Compares Pregnancy From Rape To What?

(How long have they known each other? Is Elsa like a daughter? A friend? A crutch? And why exactly does Elsa travel so far to visit this woman? And if the friendship of Miss Helen means so much, why does Elsa complain about coming on short notice for what is clearly a crisis?) Harris had a better time as Miss Helen, but I was never quite sure what we were supposed to think of this woman either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was she a talented artist? (The show is based on the life of a real Afrikaner whosehome is now a national monument, so presumably that's the intent.) For all we know, her sculpturemight indeed just be a hobby, albeit an admirable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the intriguing modernist poster for thisproduction is bolder than anything we see from Miss Helen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At times she appears a confused frail oldwoman while at other points she's a vibrant figure who knows exactly who she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Characters can containcontradictions of course, but in this case it seemed the show that was confused, not Miss Helen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Dale was a revelation to me, never having had the chance to see him onstage before, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His Marius is crystal clear every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're told he's a scheming man trying to oust Helen from her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when he arrives we find a reasonable, if mannered fellow who might just have her best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dale slowly reveals layers and layers to deepen our understanding of this man, as opposed to our whipsaw emotions about the two women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each has strong moments and the three of them make it a show worth seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I can't help preferring it was in a smaller space that would allow these three actors (who never overact, mind you) the intimacythe piece calls for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I wish this production had developed a clearer idea of these two women so wecould see Fugard's play more clearly as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale)The Agony And The Ecstasy Of Steve Jobs ** 1/2 All-American ** All's Well That Ends Well/Shakespeare in the Park ** The Atmosphere Of Memory 1/2 * Bonnie &amp; Clyde feature profile of Jeremy Jordan Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 The Cherry Orchard with Dianne Wiest ** Chinglish * 1/2 Close Up Space * Crane Story ** Cymbeline at Barrow Street Theatre *** Dedalus Lounge * 1/2 Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) The Most Awkward Wedding Photobombs PHOTO: Christina Aguilera's 'Your Body' Dress Doesn't Leave Much To The Imagination DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 John Hillcoat Lawless: Reinventing the Gangster Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben Cardin This Is No Way to Win an Election TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2Like 2k Like 753 Like 201 Surprising New Aniston Rumor Kim K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wants Hollywood Star Alanis Morissette Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson's Shocking Tweets About Isaac Jon Voight Blasts Obama Administration, Mainstream Media Shia LaBeouf Dropped Acid For His New Film WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin An Evening With Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin *** Follies *** 1/2 Fragments *** Godspell ** 1/2 Goodbar * 1/2 Hair *** Hand To God *** Hero: The Musical * 1/2 How The World Began * 1/2 Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway *** Irving Berlin's White Christmas *** It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later *** 1/2 King Lear at Public with Sam Waterston ** Krapp's Last Tape with John Hurt *** Lake Water ** Leo *** Love's Labor's Lost at the PublicLab ** 1/2 Lysistrata Jones * Man And Boy * 1/2 The Man Who Came To Dinner ** Maple And Vine ** Master Class w Tyne Daly ** 1/2 Measure For Measure/Shakespeare in the Park *** Milk Like Sugar *** Mission Drift * 1/2 Misterman ** 1/2 The Mountaintop ** 1/2 Newsies ** Pigpen's The Nightmare Story *** 1/2 Once *** 1/2 Olive and The Bitter Herbs ** 1/2 On A Clear Day You Can See Forever * 1/2 One Arm *** Other Desert Cities on Broadway ** 1/2 Private Lives ** Queen Of The Mist ** 1/2 Radio City Christmas Spectacular ** 1/2 Relatively Speaking * 1/2 The Road To Mecca ** 1/2 Samuel &amp; Alasdair: A Personal History Of The Robot War ** 1/2 The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ** 1/2 Seminar ** Septimus &amp; Clarissa *** 1/2 Shlemiel The First ** 1/2 Silence!
