(Plus, Idol will be #1 for six seasons in a row!) But last week Idol beat DWTS and did it again this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, DWTS scored 18.93 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on Tuesday, Idol scored 19.14 million (down about 20% from last season, mind you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DWTS results show scored 13.45 million while Idol 's results show reached 18.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More importantly, ratings magnet Kate was eliminated on DWTS .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Idol has beaten the show two weeks in a row and is heading towards the finale so it should triumph again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And anyonewho thinks reality shows are rigged is crazy: the producers would have LOVED Kate to stay on thatshow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PERFORMANCE SHOW COVERAGE: American Idol gives back and Alicia Keys was the mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She generously showed what a good mentor Adam Lambert was by saying little more than that the singers should try to connect to the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Celebrity Skin | Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 72 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Comments (2,704) WATCH: Demi Moore In A Teeny Bikini Comments (420) Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Comments (582) Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Comments (148) Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Comments (48) Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

[Thanks to reader dunedin for pointing out my error in crediting the song to Lindsey Buckingham.] James had some stinging guitar, which echoed note for note the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perfectly good cover but not special, which is what all the judges said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon pointed out it's notparticularly tied into the theme of giving back (unless of course you're Bill Clinton).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did Lindsey loanCasey his guitar or was it donated for charity? I can't even imagine him watching the show. (Though I am delighted that super cool Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl is goofily devoted to Cowell's UK show The X Factor.) LEE DEWYZE -- Sang Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "The Boxer," which is a wonderful Paul Simon tune that's just on the edge of dated, but in an endearing, earnest, collegiate Sixties sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was no surprise he skipped the line about visiting the whores on Seventh Ave (a shame, since I grew up on Seventh Ave inPompano Beach, Florida and my sisters and I always jokngly cheered at that part).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better than James, but it was a bit draggy (like the song, to be fair), though the judges raved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIM URBAN -- Sang "Better Days" by the Goo Goo Dolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, the wheels come off for cute as a button Tim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Painfully bad vocals but he's ready for the CW pilot season, isn't he? AARON KELLY -- Sang "I Believe I Can Fly" by R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Way too familiar a choice for a song overdone on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet in a complete reversal of Tim, Aaron got back on track and gave a very good performance after weeks of seeming lost -- and the country twang made the song actually sound fresh.Just in time to put him back in contention for the finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIOBHAN MAGNUS -- Sang "When You Believe," a duet between Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston from the animated film The Prince of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It won the Oscar for Best Song, but like the film is thoroughly forgettable even as you're listening to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Siobhan hit a few notes in the way Idol viewers enjoy which might be enough to keep her from the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her post-song chat didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you don't seem to be having fun, people don't have fun watching you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL LYNCHE -- Sang the Nickelback tune "Hero," which I don't know in the least so I have nothing to compare it to. (I'm traveling so I wasn't able to buy it and download it to hear the original.) Kind of anonymous but had some energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRYSTAL BOWERSOX -- Sang "People Get Ready," by the Impressions and covered by just about everyone else since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank the Lord! After weeks of coasting, Crystal used no instrument, sang a cappella to start, looked supremely confident and knocked it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then oh my god overwhelmed by emotion she broke down to show a little humanity! Perfect timing and no one else is even close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No ideawhat Simon said because my recording cut off but I'm sure he raved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bottom three: Casey james, Tim Urban and Siobhan Magnus, with Tim and Siobhan in the bottom two and Tim going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What do you think?

And what would they say about Taylor Swift or Justine Bieber? (And yes, I put the "e" on there on purpose.) Kara probably would have said Christina and Madonna just don't know who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orimagine Bob Dylan on Idol when he was 19. (or now) I think Bob Dylan would have been great in a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was very handsome as a young guy, very quick with a quip, loved the camera and knew how to play to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus he has a deep love of many genres but can't help but be himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taylor Swift of course would not havemade it past Hollywood week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDOL Experts are saying ratings PLUMMET now that TIM URBAN is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check out the story itspretty compelling - LOOK at page too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ITS looks like IDOL makes out more then the charity http://bit .ly/chVsoe Looks like Crystal tears were crocodile too http://bit .ly/dgLZ7h Crystal has been my choice from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is my kind of music.Crystal is also a great songwriter .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Check some of her original music on YouTube - Farmer's Daughter, Mama, Holy Toledo, Hellbent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn't bubblegum music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just hope 19 Entertainm ent doesn't try to fit her into the pop music box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wouldn't that be ironic after all the judges' comments about how she knows herself, is true to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paltrow Dishes on Cruise Kiss Raven Symone's HugeWeight Loss MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER NFL Sex Animals Russia Beauty Lady Gaga Natalie Portman Golf ChileHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »Recency | Popularity Page: 1 2 Next › Last » (2 total) HUFFPOST SUPER USER MaryscottOConnor 01:01 PM on 4/25/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Don Parker 02:23 AM on 4/23/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:37 AM on 4/28/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER markatlarge 09:37 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST COMMUNITY MODERATOR Bluesue 08:26 PM on 4/22/2010Natalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During 'Black Swan' 124 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 806 Comments Animal Torture as Entertainment?

As far as Crystal, I think she is fun to watch and listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is comfortabl e performing , sounds good, and is cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I own all of Raitt's albums, though, so that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree about the nasal quality in her singing and thought she'd lose fans by her dull, very uncool and unquirky choice of such an anonymous, boring song as the (admitting ly Oscar winning) tune from The Prince of Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the closer we get to the end, the moreimportant it is to reach out to the casual viewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan at the very least has to look likeshe's having fun and reveling in her quirkiness .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was one thing you never doubted about Adam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was having a blast.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Don Parker 01:54 AM on 4/23/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST COMMUNITY MODERATOR Bluesue 11:07 AM on 4/23/2010 Permalink | Share it gavottes 02:55 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it Michael Giltz 05:52 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it 470 Fans 52 Fans 9 Fans 4 Fans 6 Fans 92 Fans FollowNo, you're completely sane and you have fine taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan is so unbearably nasal it actually hurts to listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These people lauding her as a great singer simply haven't afreakin' clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you for correcting us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the future, we'll all check with you to find out whowe're allowed to enjoy and who we must find unbearable .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please forgive us, Your Highness, for having our own opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All I agree about Lindsey Buckingham , but "Don't Stop" is a Christine McVie song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yikes! Thanks for the correction .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey let me down with another fluff performanc e after the fantastic Jealous Guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just re-watched Jealous Guy and it is stunningly good and heartfelt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agree with you Michael, Buckingham is an amazing fingerstyl e guitarist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey did do a great cover but it was in no way original or special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think LB has to sign off on the song so in that sense he gave his approval for it to be sung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike many artists who refuse to let Idol sing theirmusic (i.e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Madonna --- who allowed it for Glee -- but there you go).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As much as I appreciate Crystal I feel no connection to her as I have done in the past.Carrie Underwood is just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me she was the biggest star there on Idol Gives Back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't like Underwood, I think she's a result of lots of hype, white voting, and CMA support on the nashville circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If music was just about the people like in the old days, she'd be athird rate CM singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blige singing Stairway was blasphemou s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its not artistry its like urinating on the American flag of rock fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She sang it like it had more than a single note message which it doesnt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The beauty of that song isnt the message, its the unexplaina ble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fantasy of fable rock anthems and she presuppose d to capsulize the lyric and song with a gospel like soul rendition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Led Zepplin and gosbel are about as far apart as fire and ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I almostvomited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It came up in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same way it did when Taylor Swift sang her tritesuperficia l song with Stevie Nicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal cried at seeing her father in the audience and the song meant something to herpersonally and you said you didnt feel a connection ?......... .....what are you a robot.HUFFPOST SUPER USER MaryscottOConnor 01:06 PM on 4/25/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Don Parker 10:26 PM on 4/26/2010 Permalink | Share it dunedin 02:48 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it Michael Giltz 05:48 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it anonimost 01:00 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it Pippen 01:25 PM on 4/22/201021 Fans 80 Fans 22 Fans Follow 4 Fans 92 Fans FollowWe are on the same page on all of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All ...STH is nothing holy, it's just a song... ...and Mary sung it to perfection ... ...truth hurts...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, I feel they should end this farce, give Crystal the trophy,(si c), bring out Bonnie Raitt and do an hour long concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or at least tell us when we can see them in concert this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do not need to see or hear any of the others again. it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan should be really big on broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless her scheduling doesn't work out, I'm sure they're trying to book Bonnie Raitt for thefinale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal is by far and away a huge artist and performer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd pay money to see her concert and buyher music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's a breath of fresh air for music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee is a close second but his stage presence and lack of performanc e will lock him into 2nd place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Either way I'd buy his music and pay to see him on stage.Sioban is a dark horse imo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She CAN be the next "new" talent to hit the industry, like Pink or Alanis did it but with some work she could be the next Cindy Lauper meets Celine Dione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron will be a huge singing star but not for several years and probably on the CMA circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey will be a star but whether or not he's going to "new" to rock will be up to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike has a narrow R&amp;B sound and he'll be good at Gospel but he's not going to win Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim - he knows he's lucky to be there and he's making the best of it with what he has to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish him well and I look for his songs to hit the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm pissed about my favorite being cut, Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd buy tickets to see her live anytime.If Crystal gets booted before the end, I'm done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll never watch Idol again.I'm still pissed they let MJ Blige sing Led Zeps Stairway to Heaven with a soul styling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

HO !! Thanks for the rundown, but I'd be careful about name-calli ng Mary J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's tough! :) ...Mary sung that song and WORKED IT!... ...are you just mad because and RnB singer covered a rock song......give credit where credit is due and deal with it...HO!!! I agree with almost all of your assessment s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including Lilly, who should still be in the running. (I skipped MJ Blige and some others; sorry I missed Annie who I love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joss and Jeff were great.) But I don't think we'll hear Tim on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He only lasted this long because the tweens and teeny boppers love his hair and smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am really blown away from how lame the list of "Inspirati onal songs" were that the kids could choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some that were not on the list:Defying Gravity, In the Arms of the Angels, I Don't Want to Be, To Where You Are as sung by JoshGrobin,Joy ful Joyful, the Pretender' s Hymn to Her, Idina Menzel's I Stand, Dusty Springfiel d's Born That Way. .. the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Can you add more? That's a great point. "Don't Stop?" GooGoo Dolls? An awful tune from The Prince OfEgypt? Not good song selections at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Song selections were horrible and what an opportunit y missed...t here are so many of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They should all study the song and delivery of Annie Lennox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amen.Permalink | Share it Michael Giltz 12:15 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it cherieamour 08:45 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Don Parker 02:03 AM on 4/23/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER skipling 11:45 PM on 4/21/2010 Permalink | Share it Michael Giltz 12:16 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it transparent 01:31 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER skipling 02:00 PM on 4/22/2010225 Fans 43 Fans 225 Fans 80 Fans 16 FansI taped the show and watched Crystal twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She had no tears, or even moisture in her eyes so my take is that the "emotion" was fake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is a great singer but sound the same on every song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WhenI compare her to Siobhan Magnus, the latter's tone and range is superior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why are they so down on Siobhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought the arrangemen t was too shortened however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she sang the full version of the song, it would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You need to get Hi-Def, Crystal was definitely crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe as much for the tune as the fact Ryan Seabiscuit sandbagged her this week and told the world he kept her from walkingoff the show, when apparently she just had a down day where she was missing her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Siobhan was my #1 early on, but she has gone off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her style has become SO mannered with unnatural vibrato, her delivery completely uninspirin g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't think taking a rocker-chi ck and forcing her to sing this kind of drivel is helping at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wasn't the biggest Lambert fan, but at least he knew who he is as an artist, as does Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siobhan doesn't have a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never has a group of songs been less inspiratio nal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why don't they have a "Be You" week where they can sing whatever they want, just like Hollywood week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would give you a lot better reflection of what their records would sound like rather than making them singsgenres they don't like, or sappy theme nights like "Inspirati onal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although watching Big Mike ignore 5 million inspiratio nal R&amp;B tunes, only to perform a goofy song from "Spiderman ", and then defend it by saying it's about heroes, was almost worth the laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have a point about Siobhan running off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is trying to please thejudges, not herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was hoping she would choose that song from the 80's madepopular by Whitney, you know the one with the lyric "children are our future, teachthem well and let them lead the way." Since she has so many young relatives, Ithought that the song would be meaningful to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My favorite song and the one that brought her to my attention was the Chris Isaak son she sang early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though she was fabulous, Simon didn't get that oneeither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big Mike doesn't have the range or tone of a truly great R and B singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like Casey, and he will be a remembered Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the final three will be Siobhan,Crystal and Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All ...yeah, the fake crying was hilarious. ..Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER greymom 11:38 PM on 4/21/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:48 AM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER greymom 10:03 AM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it cherieamour 08:44 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it Richbruin 10:32 PM on 4/21/20104 Fans 30 Fans 4 Fans 336 Fans 4 Fans 0 FansCrystal is by far the best.....b ut could you please take out the damn piercing? It is NOT attractive .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I agree, but what are ya gonna do? The kids love their piercings. wow, interestin g posts. i never thought about the christian angle keeping poor singers around way past their expiration date. that explains why tim urban is still on the show. i do not understand why Sioban is being pan by the judges. she is still the best singer on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey and Lee are are the same musical type, but the judges never criticizes Lee for standing andplaying his guitar like they do Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey is being held back by the format of the show. i get theimpression that he wants to let loss on his guitar, play a long solo, and jump around the stage.Lee butchered the lyrics for "the Boxer" and i did not really cared for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope tim urban goes hometonight, because voice was not in tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a long history on reality shows of people getting a boost fromdifferent passionate fanbases, whether it's Idol or Nashville Star or any show where fansvote. getting a prayer chain going to help out a Christian contestant is fine just like it'snatural for Mexican Americans to support one of their own or Koreans to get excited by oneof theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I get tired of the judges trying to say "Do Something different! ".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are the type of people who would have Stevie Nicks on there and tell her she needs to "Break out of that whole Stevie nicksthing yo, do some Mariah!" Or people who would have Lady Ga Ga on there and tell her tosing....we ll some Mariah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not really a Casey James fan, but if playing the guitar and singing that type of song is what he does it would be stupid of him to get up there and do a song by Justinbieber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This season is beyond boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ha! Funny post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think "do something different" is their catch phrase this year as a substitute for "that wasn't good." Crystal does basically the same thing every week and they love her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just has to be something they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been waiting for one of the singers to snap back at the judges when they sayon one hand: 'omg you ruined a classic, why did you mess with a classic' and thenon the other hand say: 'you didn't make it your own, you didn't add anything new' .WTH? That's probably why I tape the show and fast forward thru EVERYTHING except the singing..e verything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't want to see Ellen with the deer in the headlightsPermalink | Share it Michael Giltz 12:25 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it LCDTV 08:49 PM on 4/21/2010 Permalink | Share it Michael Giltz 12:27 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it CAMBEL 05:49 PM on 4/21/2010 Permalink | Share it Michael Giltz 12:28 PM on 4/22/2010 Permalink | Share it louisianalass 06:46 PM on 4/22/20102 Fans 83 Fans 4 Fanslook, I don't want to hear Whatserfac e say 'you owned it' and don't even get me started on Simon who says, 'I'm not being rude' when he means he doesn't MEAN to be rude, but...he's rude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ryan..plea se...enoug h with the dramatic crap, and the posing in a different place in the audience every 14 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JUst stand upthere and be an emcee, the show isn't about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Idol jumped the proverbial shark for me two seasons ago and I still haven't gotten off it altogether .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm getting there!
