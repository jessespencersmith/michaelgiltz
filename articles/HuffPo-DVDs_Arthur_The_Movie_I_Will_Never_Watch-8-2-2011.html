I'll happily watch a new take on Spiderman and Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan and all sorts of iconic characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But some movies just shouldn't be touched -- not because they're so fragile or precious but because it makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remake Casablanca ? Remake Citizen Kane? Remake Animal House or Ghostbusters ? No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's my toast to the original film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this remake had received sparking reviews, I might have been in a terrible fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since it got mixed to poor reviews, I can heave a sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has modest extras and a great cast and I look forward to seeing Helen Mirren and Jennifer Garner and Greta Gerwig and Luis Guzman in other moviesright away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TORCHWOOD COMPLETE ORIGINAL UK SERIES ($129.98 BluRay or $119.98 regular DVD; BBC/2entertain) -- This spin-off from Doctor Who is more adult, more dangerous and sexier, thanks to a fine cast led by the terrific John Barrowman as the bisexual, alien-fighting Captain Jack Harkness, leaderof a team of secretive operatives who protect earth from interstellar baddies, all from their home base inCardiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just launched in the US as a rather larkier, jazzed up series on the Starz channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This boxedset contains all 31 episodes from the original run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's exciting to see the show get better and better untilthe final 5 episode miniseries "Children Of Earth," a grim, marvelous peak that may very well be the best run of episodes in Torchwood OR Doctor Who.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RANGO ($44.99 combo BluRay pack or $29.99 regular DVD; Paramount) -- Johnny Depp is nothing if not eccentric and this animated Western reflects his sensibility nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a modest hit worldwide by the standards of expensive animated films (just about $250 million worldwide) but ask around and you'llfind an avid core of movie lovers who think this tale of a chameleon taming a town is a keeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thatshould be enough for you to put it in your Netflix wish list or pick up a DVD and make sure you give it awhirl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Kumi Naidoo Don’t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?

(Kudos for getting producer Trevor Horn to do the score.) It came and went at the box office but Topher Grace will surelystep up to grade A material at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he needs a stint on Dexter or some other TV series to open people's eyes to his dramatic range?

Miss Universe Is Fixed By Donald Trump: Choreographer PHOTOS: Johnny Depp Gets Creepy Like 2KHEARTBEATS ($24.98; Sundance Selects) -- A bisexual Jules &amp; Jim with a dash of Wong Kar Wai thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie is interspersed with people talking about their doomed romances in faux documentary style, with an Almodovar-esque beauty (one actress has a wonderfully angular face)especially memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then we meet best friends Francis (Dolan) and Marie (Monia Chokri).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's gay and makes little slashes on his bathroom wall every time a guy turns him down for a relationship (really? 40+ guys wouldn't want him?) and she wears vintage clothing and hangs out with him while they run down everyone in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like a dappled deer, in wanders Nicolas (Niels Schneider), a tall curly-haired Adonis who loves ingenuously flirting with both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film is a tug of war between the two, withNicolas either bemused or unaware of their desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mostly it's an excuse for Dolan to develop his skills asa filmmaker.This is a huge leap forward stylistically with Dolan telling much of the story through visuals.Dolan and Chokri are inherently appealing but the audience should be given more reason to care forthem; they're so busy being sour and dissing each other that we don't get to warm up to them like weshould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also finds the perfect ending -- a nice visual moment -- only to tack on a coda that isthoroughly unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie looks great but seems to have been made on a dime, if that makesany sense, which is another good sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully Dolan -- who is also acting in other films -- will continuemaking movies at a furious pace and keep pushing himself to grow artistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got a great film inhim and perhaps a great career as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MUSIC DVD ROUNDUP PHIL OCHS: THERE BUT FOR FORTUNE ($27.95; First Run) PETER, PAUL AND MARY: 25TH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT ($16.98; Shout) JOHNNY WINTER: LIVE AT ROCKPALAST ($19.96; MVD) BB KING LIVE ($17.97; Image) DIZZY GILLESPIE IN REDONDO ($14.96; MVD) YO GABBA GABBA!
