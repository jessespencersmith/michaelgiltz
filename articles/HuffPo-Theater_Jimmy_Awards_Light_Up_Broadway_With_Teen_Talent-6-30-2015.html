Clearly a tremendous effort has been made to give all the actors bits of business: they stay incharacter even when performing in the ensemble or passing off the baton from one performer to the next, oftengetting little laughs but never, ever upstaging one another or interfering with the overall flow.Marla Louissant was the night's standout and won Best Actress for her performance as Caroline, as well as asolo turn doing "I'm Here" from The Color Purple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges have a lot more to draw upon when making theirchoices than the audience but there was no doubting Louissant's talent as an actress and singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the newBroadway revival of The Color Purple didn't already have its star, Louissant would be ready to make the leaptoday, just as a runner up from two years ago jumped right into the West End revival of Miss Saigon.Anthony Skillman won Best Actor after doing a number from Tarzan and a solo turn from Parade, specificallyFrankie's angry soliloquy "It Don't Make Sense." And Skillman proved Tony ready in his endearing acceptancespeech, giving a happy shout out to the Supreme Court decision for marriage equality and thanking his parentsin the audience in the same breath.Here's Skillman doing a performance of a medley during one of the regional events leading up to the finals.Yet they were far from the only story here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I circled six people as locks for the finals (I got three right) andanother ten as very promising talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So more applause for Kylie Lynn Heyman who gave verve to RenoSweeney of Anything Goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was certain she'd be one of the finalists! Travis Anderson was a long-limbed LordEvelyn Oakleigh, also from Anything Goes (but a different production), creating a full comic performance inabout 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was matched by Zac Gottschall's equally winning Horace Vandergelder from Hello, Dollyand Larry McKay's charming J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pierrepont Finch from How To Succeed.Marnie Quick made the tricky Bacharach/David tune "Wishin' And Hopin'" seem easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She too was a deservedfinalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleksander Papanastasopoules had by far the best name of the night and was a very good Javert,matched by Evatt Salinger's convincing Jean Valjean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kamari A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saxon was the lucky talent who earned ascholarship to attend Carnegie Mellon's pre-College Drama Program. (I wish I'd been able to hear hisperformance from Violet in full.) Noah Barnes was a natural for Joe Hardy from Damn Yankees he's toohandsome and gifted with such a classic, gorgeous Broadway voice (he opened his mouth and filled theMinskoff with ease) that you have to believe this won't be the last time Barnes will be on stage in New York.Finally, my vote for Best Actor based simply on what I saw this night was for finalist Alec Michael Ryan who wasexcellent as Laurence in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and -- like Louissant -- had one of the night's cleveresttransitions and made the most of it, in his case playing off Les Miserables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His solo turn ("Who I'd Be" fromShrek The Musical) jand medley number both felt like complete performances as both actor and singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don'talways say that with the pros being paid to perform on Broadway every night but I'm saying it about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I'dhappily pay to see him perform again.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating</p>
