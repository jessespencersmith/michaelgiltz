Interestingly, Reynoldshas more success with the passionately defensive Hauptmann than the tight-lipped Lindbergh while Larsen enjoys her best moments as the stolid Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindbergh rather than the wife who spends her life protesting her husband's innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Thomas Holmes has great fun as the ringmaster Walter Winchell, setting up the story and informing us of developments (and the general public opinion) in the rat-a-tat manner of a newsman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, the emotional high point was Hannah Elless as reporter Adela St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johns describing AnneLindbergh on the day of her testimony in "Hour Of Gold" (a song named after Lindberg's memoir).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theirduet has the wrenching emotional power you want and expect, anchoring a story that often has razzle dazzle but not always the undercurrent of genuine heart that such a story needs to make us care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the many songs of cynicism begin to blend a bit, with one piece after another mocking the media frenzy that erupted around the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other times, the much-needed heart is attempted but not reached, such as Melissa van der Schyff's passionate delivery of "Dirty Dishes," a song by a servant badgered by the police and the media which stretches a modest image to the breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The set and costume design by Martin Lopez is top-notch, with stacks of newspapers cleverly used in numerous ways throughout, always reminding us that however painful the story, at least it sells papers.Ditto the lighting by Zach Blane and the graphic design by Ben Spriggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, the choreography byWarren Adams and the sterling direction by Jeremy Dobrich take a large cast and a complicated tale anddeliver it with pizazz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The performance I saw was unfortunately plagued with audio problems throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now that I know it's been in development for a decade, I'm not certain they're ready to somehow tighten and focus the story even more, uncovering the beating heart that lies at its center without losing the caustic take on the media that drives it along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly, the umpteenth scene of corruption in "Lawsuit Daddy" felt like overkill, as fun as it was for the actors to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the title is a bother throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've no idea what rights are at issue, but surely a better title than Baby Case could be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also proves a weak chorus in the title song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many other songs, however, are strong, and the sense that something needs to be focused more tightly is a common complaint of Kander and Ebb shows... the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And like most Kander and Ebb shows, I'd love the chance to see Baby Case -- whatever it's called -- again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an intelligent, sometimes truly exciting piece of theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it falls short in some ways, that's because it attempts so very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FOREVERMAN * 1/2 out of **** THE PEARL ON 42 ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of Frank Wildhorn should rush to catch Foreverman , a new musical very much in the vein of Jekyll and Hyde and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brett M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boles wrote the book, music and lyrics and while his tale is rooted in the romantic potboilers of Robert Louis Stevenson and the like, at least he came up with an original story: two young men, one wealthy and one poor, become fast friends, discover an elixir that can offer eternal youth and then bitterly part ways over the love of a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their struggles to achieve happiness and truelove will take hundreds of years to reach its climax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreverman is handsomely mounted with a serviceable scenic design by John McDermott, so-so projections by Mark Costello and excellent costumes by Anne Liberman and Barry Doss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those clothes do the heavy lifting when it comes to setting the period and the high adventure mood of a costumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is strong-voiced and does their best while director Stephen Nachamie ably keeps this ambitious work focused and moving along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, Boles is akin to Wildhorn in spirit and deed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His book takes forever to get going and continually must stop and explain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plot twists are downright silly -- a kiss immediately reawakensone character's suppressed memories of a past life? Sure, you'd go with it in some context but not here.The cuts back and forth between centuries in the first act feel random and unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And most damning of all, the songs are filled with tepid lyrics that all the passion in the world can't ignite. "You're a sun and I'm a shooting star" is perhaps a fine distinction between a woman cursed to die young and a man who will live forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the shooting star image is repeated again and again, 'til you're sick ofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pedestrian rhymes abound. "She's a mystery and a danger/ Now she's here to stay" or "Fiona/ The world bursts into blossom at the sound of her name" or "I know this isn't what we planned/The way we thought our lives would go/ What stranger's footprints in the sand/ Have caused an elemental chainreaction" or "It's madly taunting and strangely haunting" and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the book, the lyrics spend agreat deal of time simply spelling out what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the fourth or fifth explanation that they've discovered an elixir that grants eternal life etc. etc. your attention begins to flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, the suspense and drama of those hundreds of years is rather mild. [SPOILER} Our two heros simply avoid each other for that entire time, meet up again unexpectedly and then rather confusingly make amends in a finale that left me a tad confused as to exactly what noble adventure they're embarkingon together.
