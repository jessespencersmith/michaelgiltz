                <p>Talmt Richard Foreman Once, director-playwright Richard Foreman's career followed a pret­ ty conventional path-at one point, he even had a play titled Hany in Love optioned for Broadway. "I had been sort of a normal play­ wright up until 1967," he says. "But when my option fell through, I was sit­ ting at home and I said, 'This is silly. " I walk into a theater tonight, what do I want to see onstage?' And in as much time as this has taken me to tell you, I had this image of a certain kind of tension between performers and a certain kind of minimal language and I started doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basically, I've been mining that moment ever since." For more than twenty years, Fore­ man has specialized in non narrative works that strive to capture what he calls "the nuances of the unfathomable." Today Foreman focuses on more intimate pieces, the latest of which-I've Got the Shak~pens January 5. "I'm always trying to evoke what is evanescent," he says. "In this play, the lead character says, 'I have something to teach, but I don't know what it is.' And I think that's everybody's position in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We may have one idea of what we're achieving, but the world ends up choosing to make use of us in ways we can't imagine." Despite numer­ ous awards (including an NEA award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theaterl, Foreman is most proud that his writing­ as opposed to his directing-is slowly garnering more attention. "When I began, people said, 'Well, he's a pretty creative director, but his writing is Dadaistic nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anybody could do that,' " Foreman says. "And I've always maintained that I'm basically a writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I only started directing plays because when I started writing the strange kind of pieces I'm writing now, no one would direct them."
