Wilson wasn't ready to be the star...not even in her own autobiography!Discovering the strength to do that is one of the many undercurrents that make My First Hundred Years In ShowBusiness more than just a witty and revealing look behind the scenes of a life in the theater.In a wide-ranging interview covering her entire career, here's Wilson talking about her friendship with BeaArthur, working on the legendary revival of Cabaret (she loved everything about it except her role) and having across-dressing boyfriend back when cross-dressing boyfriends weren't so common.Here's Wilson on her late brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vivid early sections of My First Hundred Years In Show Business captureher deliciously dysfunctional childhood in New Orleans, with an alcoholic mother, a sister who would later send12/16/2015BookFilter: Tony Winner Mary Louise Wilson On Embracing Success And Self-Esteem (Finally!) | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=43ffcaea-3a0d-48b9-bb80-ea510403f530&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/2Wilson clippings about actresses who had committed suicide or been institutionalized (acting was rather anembarrassing pursuit, wasn't it?) and a brother Wilson later realized was gay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her brother embraced thedesperate snobbery of Wilson's mother and yearned for the respectability that would never come: on his deathbed, he was still trying to get onto the social register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With her book released just as the Supreme Court rules infavor of equal marriage rights for gays, Wilson wishes he'd lived to see this day.Finally, here is Wilson on having the support of feared theater critic John Simon and the satisfaction of writingher own, final review.See the full interview on the front page of BookFilter.Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head toBookFilter if you want to find more great picks in every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover smart picks by our crackerjackstaff, not crowd-sourced reviews saying -- yet again -- hey, you should read "The Girl On A Train!"
