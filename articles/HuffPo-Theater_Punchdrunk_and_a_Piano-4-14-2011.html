While Sleep No More may be unusual and hard to classify, it is also most assuredly theater of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You enter the space, don a mask that's very Eyes Wide Shut , are enjoined not to speak a word and then spend several hours wandering through four or five floors of an abandoned warehouse, each floor filledwith rooms that are bursting with specific and fascinating detail -- from a detective's office to a sweetsshop to a graveyard and a banquet hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everywhere you go you'll spot people trailing this or that actor.Once you latch onto Macbeth or Lady Macbeth, friends suggested you follow them for a while until youfeel the scenes repeating or just want to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's what I did, following Lady Macbeth for about 45minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At several points she stood inches from my face, peering into my eyes with a distracted, hauntedlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeing hordes of masked people dog her every step, literally haunting her as she ran down a hallway must provide a thrilling energy to the cast and made this show intriguing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond a few whispered lines about "blood" and "damned spots," you don't hear much dialogue from her or anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I started trailing Macbeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I felt the storylines crossing again (the basic plot seems to repeat two or three times), I began to stalk one of the secondary actors, a handsome fellow who danced amarvelous solo piece before being put into a sleep by one of the witches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then I purposely stepped awayfrom the "action" and just wandered into this and that room, opening drawers and peering into ledgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Istumbled upon one actor stitching up a teddy bear and at another moment a woman grabbed one of theaudience members and pulled him into her bedroom, shutting the rest of us out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just when I felt I'd seeneverything, an entirely new level of rooms and scenes opened up in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One nursery tucked away into a corner (my guest never even saw it) was so haunting and beautifully done (headless and limbless dolls sprayed up from an empty battered crib) that I wouldn't have been surprised to see an identicalinstallation at the Whitney Biennial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's that good and this sort of attention to detail continuesthroughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm making it sound like some sort of hipster interactive theater, but that's far from the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time and again, I was blown away by some stunning scene: a banquet dinner with the cast moving in slow motionand set to overwhelming music and hypnotic lighting was thrilling, as was a dance scene and what mighthave been a rave or the witches' prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The choreography, the sound design (which includes musicfrom films by Alfred Hitchcock among other sources), the sets, the lighting are all wonderfully realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ican't even single out individual castmembers since I rarely knew who was playing whom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certainly afamiliarity with Macbeth helps but it may not even be essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not handicapped friendly and if you're not spry, this may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A LOT of stair-climbing is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you have any sense of adventure, this is theater you don't want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EVANS HAILE: SALON SOIREE *** ETC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ETC.Evans Haile is a theatrical impresario and performer who has performed all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's perhaps best known for being the Artistic Director of the Cape Playhouse , America's oldest professional summer theater; his acclaimed recordings of 50 Million Frenchmen, Magdalena and Babes In Arms, among others; and the late, lamented series of NPR specials he hosted called Toast Of The Town that centered onBroadway and the theater world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His current one-man show is typical of Haile, combining personal memories with casually informative anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
