"Get In Line" is an amusing opener about everyone trying to bring him down or explain to Sexsmith what he's doing wrong in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heaven? Peace and love? He'll "Believe It When I See It." "Middle OfLove" is probably the key radio track -- the song that seems like the winner that can finally get himplayed on the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the title tune is his forceful statement of purpose -- he's not driven by the need forcommercial success, but it sure would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sexsmith isn't depressed by having more clippings thanalbum sales and he doesn't feel beaten yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If anything, he's coming into his own. "I'm a late bloomer/ I'ma slow learner/ And I've heard the penny drop/ I'm a small player/ With a tall order/ To come out ontop." As I've said, this is pop music for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people write songs about passionate first love, wild-eyed romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sexsmith delivers the even more romantic sound of someone who appreciates more and morewhat they have every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some pop songs are for wooing on a first date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sexsmith's tunes will break yourlover's heart with their beauty on your anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On "Miracles," he sings, "It's a miracle/ Here in thishand I hold/ Here in this band of gold/ How even the silence/ Seems to say more than enough." A songabout a happy marriage? Now that's romantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His list of great albums is long and growing, from the notable breakthrough Ron Sexsmith -- touted loudly and widely by Elvis Costello -- to peaks like Whereabouts and Retriever to the one-off collaboration with drummer Don Kerr, Destination Unknown .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been obsessed at times with tunes like Striking Distance Of Obama Popeater: Brad and Angelina's Strict Nanny Requirements Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?
