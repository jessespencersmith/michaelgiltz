(Her birthday, by the way, is on November22, just four days before Schulz.) King won a remarkable 39 Grand Slam titles, including 12 singles titles and has been an ardent supporterof women's rights both in sports and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's touching to read that while she was traveling the globe King found comfort in discovering Peanuts in the local newspapers and a special thrill when Sparky -- as Schulz was known to his friends and loved ones -- mentioned her by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She writes: From time to time, Sparky included me in Peanuts .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A particular favorite of mine had Peppermint Patty telling Marcie, "Has anyone ever told you that when you're mad, you look just like Billie Jean King?"Trust me: my friends had a heyday with that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sparky referenced me several times in Peanuts and it was his way of letting me know that we needed to talk or just catch up with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He rarely phoned me, but when he wanted to check in, he 1 of 5 Billie Jean King Repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Is a Big Deal Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our TimeDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS johnston in playgirl kim zolciak pregnant miley cyrus lap dance video sarah palin michelle obama shania twain Against Sarah Palin Amanda Knox Court Makes Crucial Ruling More Celebrity News at People.com Like 250 Like 155 Ask Steven Tyler a Question!

One of those events where us oldsters would have to describe to the youngsters what happened and then stare at our feet aswe try to explain why some people believed it was important that women athletes have theirprofession al accomplish ments smacked down and why some of us cheered so loudly when King quieted "The Mouth."
