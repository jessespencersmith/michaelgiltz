Read More: American Idol , Lil Rounds , Paula Abdul , Pop Music , Reality TV, Simon Cowell , Von Smith , Entertainment News UPDATE: So America voted three more of the Top 36 contestants into the final 12: Lil Rounds, Scott MacIntyre and Jorge Nunez, giving me aperfect sweep in predictions this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hit 7 ofthe 9 people who made it into the Top 12. (Here'sMichael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly's initial reaction .) Lil and Jorge did their thing but Scott's reprise of "Mandolin Wind" was even worse thanTuesdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really don't think he'll last long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iliked the way they handled the announcements.They got clear winner Lil Rounds out of the wayquickly and neatly (not to mention without pairing her off with someone who would then know for certain they were doomed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then batchesof people got dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pairing Nathaniel and Kristen was perfect and you could see his face fellwhen Ryan didn't begin the announcement by suggesting one of them would go through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andfacing off Ju'Not and Jorge was great since that had genuine suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naming the Wild Card team was suspenseful as well, with each person being named seeming to sprint out of that upstairs holding room towards the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was thrilled to see Von Smith benamed first since I think that was a show of support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And surely the only thing unanimous aboutputting Tatiana through was that the producers would be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The eight in order of beingnamed were: Von Smith, Jasmine Murray, Ricky Braddy, Megan Corkrey, Tatiana Del Toro, MattGiraud, Jesse Langseth and Anoop Desai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their performances should sway the judges a tad, butsight unseen I'd expect Anoop and Jesse to get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something about Jesse being a last minutesubstitution bodes well for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the third pick really should swivel on how they do, but I'mrooting for Von Smith to have another strong performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, we already have six guys inthe final 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no way they'll choose three girls from the Wild Card but it's equally unlikelythe producers will let them have eight guys and four women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That gives Jasmine and Megan aserious leg up (please, not Tatiana unless she suddenly mellows and sings well, of course).Nonetheless, I'll stick with my two guys and one gal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

ORIGINAL POST: The third round of the top 36 performed on Tuesday and to me the men clearly outshone the women, who were generally dreadful or (even worse) forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember, you only need one man and one woman and one wild card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ratings were strong of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Marc Berman of Mediaweek (who bizarrely thinks Nathaniel Marshall will be brought back for the Wild card), Idol scored a 13.8 rating, which means roughly 25 million people were watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the AP summary and an early response from Entertainment Weekly's Michael Slezak, who thought eight out of 12 had a shot at strong voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here is his full recap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Ken Levine weighs in with his scathing rundown of the contestants. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Von Smith -- The night got off to a great start with Von Smith, who really impressed me with his restrained but fresh performance of Marvin Gaye's "You're All I Need To Get By," one of aseries of classic duets Gaye recorded with Tammi Terrell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Von Smith is a theater boy overshadoweda tad by the more Rent -ish Adam Lambert, not to mention Smith's own over-singing in Hollywood Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite being given the deadly first slot (when the number of people who haven't tuned inyet ranks in the millions, making it harder to garner votes), he did a great job despite the MiamiVice -styled jacket and t-shirt look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He got better and better and really won me over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon compared him to Clay Aiken and Von fumbled a tad in responding but finally said the right thingabout Clay being hugely successful and that it was a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duh! And next time, Vonseriously needs to cover Rick Astley because that's who he really looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he'd performedtowards the end, Von would have a MUCH better shot of getting through. (Check out the ratingsbreakdown at Mediaweek which I linked to above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ratings went from 12.2 at 8 p.m. to 13.5 at8:30 p.m. to 14.8 from 9 to 10 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a huge gap in audience and the fewer people that watchyou perform, the fewer that are likely to vote.) I felt so bad for him, he's the first person I've votedfor this season. (I usually don't bother until the final 12.) All four judges were strongly enthusiasticabout his vocals but that seemed forgotten by the end of the show. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taylor Vaifanua -- Singing "If I Ain't Got You" by Alicia Keys, Taylor seemed to lose track of the tempo and never found it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was a little better on the chorus but had a really bad last note to end on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara began the first in a series of encomiums to the singers, saying ofTaylor, "You've had a voice from the moment we met you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got talent." But she wonderedwhat Taylor was really like. "What's it like to go shopping with Taylor?" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Paulahaving done her homework and relating current performances to Hollywood Week (which were taped months ago, remember), Kara has stepped in to provide loopy comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Taylor was almost in tears from the moment she ended the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She knew. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Wagner-Trugman -- The somewhat dorky college student tackled Elton John's "I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues," one of his gems from a resurgence in the 80s (though talking about a resurgence for an artist who has delivered consistently for four decades is silly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexstarted off great, but soon devolved into an almost ludicrous attempt to sound soulful a la joeCocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was actually doing it for a bar or two when he wasn't trying and then suddenly itseemed as if he were possessed by the soul of John Belushi as one of the Blues Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When hesang "Rolling like thunder under the covers" I giggled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That can't be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad because withrestraint and practice he could be solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon nailed it as usual by saying he was like "a littlehamster trying to be a tiger." 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arianna Afsar -- The 17 year old sang ABBA's "The Winner Takes It All" in a train wreck of a misguided performance right down to the very rough last note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A shot of her parents looking miserable said it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To her credit, despite having to hear friendly but harsh critiques, Ariannaremained composed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's appropriate to sing ABBA since they made their breakthrough on the songcontest Eurovision with the unstoppable "Waterloo." This tune, their last Top 10 hit in a whirlwind9 years of chart dominance, also includes the Idol-appropriate line "The judge will decide." Theydid. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ju'not Joyner -- Sang the Illinois band Plain White T's memorable "Hey There Delilah" in a slowed-down somewhat soulful version that I thought was ok but which the judges and my friend "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oscar de la Renta Slams Michelle Obama's BuckinghamOutfit As Major Designers Feel Ignored While Michelle Obamahas made lesser...

Kristen sang Tracey Chapman's "Give Me OneReason," an easy mid-tempo tune that is the biggest hit of that engaging artist's career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It peaked at#3 for FIVE weeks in 1996, so there must have been some crazy logjam at #1 and #2 that summer.And since the hateful "Macarena" was #1 for fourteen weeks, we know which song to blame forkeeping her from going higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristen insisted "my strength is my voice," a curiously obviousclaim for someone in a singing competition to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She left me completely cold, even as Iappreciated her vaguely Dusty Springfield attempt to go for some southern soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just didn't buy itat all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the women judges liked her (Kara said, "You are a great singer!") and the men didn't. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nathaniel Marshall -- He good-naturedly admits being "tagged" with the label of drama queen, when it would have been much more fun to have him embrace actually BEING a dramaqueen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sang Meat Loaf's hilariously contradictory song "I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won'tDo That)." It was by far the biggest pop hit of Meat Loaf's career, staying at #1 for five weeks. (Hisbig album Bat Out Of Hell exploded because of relentless touring and AM rock radio stations morethan hit singles.) Nathaniel's performance was unfortunately bad for good (that's a Jim Steinmanreference btw).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His look was very Flashdance , with spikey hair and a blue headband Simon described as very Olivia Newton John -- not winning any points for cleverness since everyone athome already shouted that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More importantly, his vocals were dreadful; just thin and weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedid however have the best post-performance banter with the judges, though I think we're far fromSanjaya territory here. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Felicia Barton -- A last minute substitute, Felicia sang Alicia Key's "No One," an uninspired song choice that she delivered fairly adroitly until she fell apart on the chorus and began oversinging until she really lost it on one of her big notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara put it far too politely by saying, "You had a few problems with some of those notes." She looked great, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At this point, I'm thinking Von Smith looks like the star of the evening, but the back end of the show is loaded with people who make an impression. 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott MacIntyre -- Scott's the visually impaired guy the judges insist they LOVE when he sits down and sings at the piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally, he's left me unimpressed most of the time but tons of airtime and a heartwarming story make him perfect Idol material for the Top 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott sings Bruce Hornsby's "Mandolin Wind," the nice tune following his breakout hit "The Way It Is." I thought hewas very so-so, running out of breath at times and flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never relaxed the entire time he wassinging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy was a tad mixed but Kara declared "You move mountains" and Simon gave him ahuge endorsement by insisting Scott should sail through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't hear it yet. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kendall Beard -- This pretty gal tackled Martina McBride's "This One's For The Girls," the last of six songs to scrape into the Top 40 (a good claim to fame for a country gal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kendall did indeed look good (the first thing Paula praised) but she was rough, bad on the chorus andultimately rather piercing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a terrible song choice because it exposed the weakness of hervoice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges were polite but mixed. 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jorge Nunez -- The Puerto Rican tackled a more familiar Elton John chestnut, "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" (#2 for two weeks back in 1973, with a couple of Beach Boys and Toni Tennille on backup vocals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it was pure Idol -- he sang the song very closely to the original (which most viewers prefer -- they like you to sing the songs they love the way they're used tohearing them) and had a handful of big notes to wow 'em with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he closed the deal with asweet chat with the judges (Kara said, "You were born to sing!"), tearing up over their praise andthen breaking into Spanish towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiences will eat it up and obviously he should getthe Latino vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't see this one coming at all. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lil Rounds -- And the show closed on a strong note with Mary J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blige -- I mean Lil Rounds PERFORMING Blige right down to the flattish moments that seem so "real" from Blige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rounds was very professional and smooth, though she does need to avoid Blige for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara sunk to alow by saying "Let me tell you, girl" in an "urban" tone and even doing the head-bobbing thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Cars Afghanistan Video Financial Crisis Barack Obama David Axelrod WarrenBuffett ClimateChange Foreign Policy MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

Drama for the sake of drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funny though because I like her voice; it's throaty and sexy but everything else about her is such a turnoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If she can find who she is and stick to bluesy adult types ofsongs and not try and do everything all at once, she might surprise everyone and come up a winner. piquet See Profile I'm a Fan of piquet permalink "Scott is there simply as a sympathy vote"...totally agree DCDan See Profile I'm a Fan of DCDan permalink Hey Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As always, loved the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I also found Kara's faux "downness" with the "sista" unseemly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't stand that nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patronizing and phony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a lot of *un*-phony, slightly veiled racism on the show which seemingly goes unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a recurring pattern throughout the seasons of telling contestants what they should and should not do, not-so-subtly based on race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like when Randy J tells Jasmine T "I didn't expect youto do that" (meaning, a *white* pop hit). "You should stick to doing things like Rhianna." Why? Because she's black? Ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happens the other way too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To white contestants, who do surprisingly well with R&amp;B joints, i.e., Paula's infamous "You're a funky little white boy!" comment to Elliott Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because he doesn't look, sing or move like Pat Boone? White performers are, generally speaking, inherently unsoulful? Prejudice is prejudice, even if it's framed in a positive light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Side note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not to seem like a hater but, as a journalist, I know you appreciate accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't mean to call you out but "Don't Let the Sun Go Down ..." was recorded and released in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps "1973"was just a typo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look forward to next week's post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, more than I look forward to the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itamar See Profile I'm a Fan of Itamar permalink Lil Rounds is one of the best dianecarol See Profile I'm a Fan of dianecarol permalink All of the 36 singers have been just fair so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't get excited yet over this year's crop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe whenI hear them a few more times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, I just hate Kara, and when she spoke in what you describedas an 'urban' tone, I cringed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She adds nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want crazy Paula back!
