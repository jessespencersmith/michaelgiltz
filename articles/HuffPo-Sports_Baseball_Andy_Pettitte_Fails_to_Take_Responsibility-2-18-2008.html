Andy again tries to justify his actions as not that bad and notreally cheating because he was only trying to recover from an injury, "Anyone that has followed mycareer knows that I have battled elbow problems the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, like I said before, I nevertook this to get an edge on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I did this to try to get off the DL and to do my job." Remarkably, even in the context of religion and his faith, Andy continues to see his breaking of federal law and besmirching baseball as morally ok. "I felt like it was the right thing to do in my heart," insists Andy. "As far as my faith, I felt good about it." Huh? Andy says -- rightly -- that kids shouldn't do what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if what he did was morally fine andhe did it for the right reasons, is that only becauseunder a technicality it's against federal law andagainst the morals clause of baseball? Andy cheated,pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But asked point blank, he says again, "Do I think I'm a cheater? No, I don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was it stupid? Yeah." He also said, "If people thinkI'm lying, then they should call me a cheater." Maybe the words to describe Andy are "in denial." Here's why.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using HGH to recover from an injury gives you an edge over other teams -- It gives your team an edge over other teams who have pitchers that are injured but refuse to cheat and break the law inorder to recover more quickly. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using HGH to recover from an injury gives you an edge over your own teammates -- Pitchers are working together to win games but they're also in competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Andy is injured, that givesanother pitcher a chance to start a major league game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It might even mean the chance for a minorleaguer to come up to the majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that means another minor leaguer might get a chance to Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

Using steroids is cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using HGH is cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheating for years is worse? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Andy cheated twice over a several year period out of "desperation" as he put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How he could be desperate, break the law and yet still believe he wasn't cheating is hard to swallow. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy says he should have had a prescription -- According to the New York Times , HGH is NEVER prescribed to professional athletes to recover form injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rare instances in which it is legal to prescribe HGH (and it is the rare drug that specifically can NOT be used for anything other than what it is specifically approved for) include dwarfism, and wasting disease associated with AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy is deeply confused about HGH if he thinks he could go to a doctor and get a prescription of it to fix a balky elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love for Andy to find some religious counselor, some ethicist, some moral leader who would tell us that breaking federal law, illegally obtaining a drug to recover from injuries faster than yourteammates or your opponenets and getting a shot late at night from a shady fitness trainer ISN'Tcheating and is in fact a-ok by them and in their opinion, by God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe one reason he can stay indenial is because he's under no threat of being suspended for even a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's one more blackmark on the failed, disastrous legacy of Bud Selig and baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy, you cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please, please wake up to that simple fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Email Print More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

I think it's a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nommo See Profile I'm a Fan of Nommo permalink It is old news, and baseball was allowed to let this happen because the owners weremaking tons of money, god was in his heaven and all was right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nowif the Congress was as on top of Iran-Contra, the outing of a covert agent and thosekinds of matters, then their pursuit of cheating ballplayers might have a greaterlegitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of steroids and HGH went on for years even though a casual observer had to know that something was going on when you see previously skinny men all of a sudden bursting uniform seams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Players performing at a level that was not justifiedby anything they had done earlier in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So who had their heads buried in the sand all this time? And if they find a way to punish all these players, do the owners, team physicians, and all those charged withmaintaining the integrity of the game get off scott-free? Remember the bottle labeled"andro" in McGuire's locker? Sport, particularly baseball has always celebrated its cheaters, from Ty Cobb's spikes to Gaylord Perry's spitballs and all the others, so it seems like days late anddollars short on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite frankly, I suggest that stolen elections are a slightly more important matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All SteveSmith See Profile I'm a Fan of SteveSmith permalink Athletes cheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the nature of being a great athlete, to find a competitive edge that others won't pursue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a fan, I expect the players on teams I root for to do whatever is necessary to get that edge,including, if necessary, "cheat" to get off the disabled list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since the usage of HGH (unlike roids) isa malum prohibitum violation of the rules, much like a college athlete taking money under the table, I'mnot bothered by what Petitte did, even though I'm not an Astros or Yankees fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink No Steve, you are completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, some athletes are like Ty Cobb and despitemassive talent they will still clobber and pummel and take advantage of every opportunity whether legal or not to gain an edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People don't breathlessly repeat stories of how they were at the Super Bowl and watched their favorite quarterback steal a signal or sneak over the line or somehow break the rules to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't say, hey remember when we were at the Daytona 500 and our favorite racer smashed the machine of his opponent into pieces when the referees weren't looking? Gosh, that was great. it is in the nature of a great athlete to play a game beautifullyand with extraordinary skill, whether you'rePele or Babe Ruth or Roger federer or Michael Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What stories do you have of MichaelJordoan cheating? None.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if he did, he would be less admired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your cynical "everyonecheats" attitude isn't borne out by any evidence, happily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Athletes who cheat are disgraced,not celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coaches who put winning first are controversial, not beloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quaoar See Profile I'm a Fan of Quaoar permalink "I'd love for Andy to find some religious counselor, some ethicist, some moral leader who would tell usthat breaking federal law, illegally obtaining a drug to recover from injuries faster than your teammatesor your opponenets and getting a shot late at night from a shady fitness trainer ISN'T cheating and is infact a-ok by them and in their opinion, by God." If he doesn't realize what he's done is wrong already, he never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No counselor or religious leader is likely to make him see reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andy Pettitte BaseballBrian McNameeCheatingHghNew York YankeesRoger ClemensSteroids Style : Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Style : Verena von Pfetten 7 Lessons To Be Learned From Carla Bruni Style : Verena von Pfetten Brow-O-Wow: Bushy Eyebrows Make AComeback (PHOTOS, POLL) Related Tags Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:31 PM on 02/19/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:27 AM on 02/20/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:55 PM on 02/18/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:36 PM on 02/19/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:59 PM on 02/18/2008Michael Giltz: Andy Pettitte Fails to Take Responsibility http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/andy-pettitte-fails-to-ta_b_87242.html[4/5/2009 7:48:47 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry Nommo See Profile I'm a Fan of Nommo permalink The day he sees reason, his career is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is the whole point, reason has never really been a part of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I remember when he left the Yanks because hethought that he had not been acknowledged by Steinbrenner after a great performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was George acting out of character?
