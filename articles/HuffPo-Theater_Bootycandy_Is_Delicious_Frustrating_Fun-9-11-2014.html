"Dreamin' in Church" isan obvious but amusing sketch about what might happen if the preacher addressed rumors about the sexualproclivities of the boys in the choir with righteous indignation and some high heels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lance Coadie Williams -- theshow's secret weapon as he portrays so many varied roles with such razor precision -- elevates the stereotypeof a sermonizing man of the cloth with his gleeful attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Williams is also wonderful as Sutter's low-key stepdad,drag queen pal and aging grandmother.While "Dreamin' In Church" and another hilarious one with four women talking on the phone are funny on theirown, the less germane set pieces ultimately prove detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A skit about a roundtable of black playwrightshas one modest joke (a clueless moderator) and the meta realization that some of the (lesser) sketches aresupposedly written by the four playwrights depicted, including a goes-nowhere sketch about a guy talking awould-be mugger into leaving him alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Least amusing of all is an "un-commitment" ceremony between twowomen that drags on and on and should obviously have been cut, despite the fact that the talented women ofthe show Benja Kay Thomas and Dukes as the couple Genitalia and Intifada give their all and do in fact squeezesome laughs out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The jokey names alone show how unworthy this piece is of O'Hara's talented mind.12/15/2015Theater: Bootycandy Is Delicious, Frustrating Fun | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=8bdf705c-aa74-431a-8fe8-14c67a753c49&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4Similarly, the meta device of the playwright's roundtable and even worse the tired conceit of stopping the showwhile the actors confront the "playwright" over his choices feel uninteresting.On the other hand, O'Hara has great taste in collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is truly excellent from top to bottom, thoughBrannon's subtle work may get unfairly overshadowed by the scene-stealing hilarity offered up to the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ClintRamos devised and excellent turntable set and great costumes that manage to be funny without being jokey.Other tech elements are superior as well, especially the hair and makeup of Dave Bova that works with theactors so well I almost expected more than five actors to come out and take a bow at the end.Those bows are well deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's simply that the core of Bootycandy is so fresh and vital, so delicious that wecan't be bothered with anything less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither should O'Hara.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical ***Rodney King *** Hard Times ** 1/2 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead ** I Could Say More * The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner ** Machinal *** Outside Mullingar *** A Man's A Man * 1/2 The Tribute Artist ** 1/2 Transport ** Prince Igor at the Met ** The Bridges Of Madison County ** 1/2 Kung Fu (at Signature) ** Stage Kiss *** Satchmo At The Waldorf *** Antony and Cleopatra at the Public ** All The Way ** 1/2 The Open House (Will Eno at Signature) ** 1/2 Wozzeck (at Met w Deborah Voigt and Thomas Hampson and Simon O'Neill) Hand To God *** Tales From Red Vienna ** Appropriate (at Signature) * Rocky * 1/2 Aladdin *** Mothers And Sons ** Les Miserables *** 1/2 Breathing Time * 1/2 Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna * 1/2 Heathers The Musical * 1/2 Red Velvet, at St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ann's Warehouse *** Broadway By The Year 1940-1964 *** 1/2 A Second Chance ** Guys And Dolls *** 1/2 If/Then * 1/2 The Threepenny Opera * 1/2</p>
