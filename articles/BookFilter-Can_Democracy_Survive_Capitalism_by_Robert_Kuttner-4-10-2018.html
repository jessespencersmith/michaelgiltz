Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? by Robert Kuttner Price: $27.95 (Hardcover) Published: April 10, 2018 Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast) From the Publisher: In the past few decades, the wages of most workershave stagnated, even as productivity increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Social supports have been cut, while corporations have achieved record profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Downward mobility has produced political backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is going on? Can Democracy SurviveGlobal Capitalism? argues that neither trade nor immigration nortechnological change is responsible for the harm to workers’ prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Robert Kuttner, global capitalism is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By limiting workers’ rights, liberating bankers, allowing corporations to evadetaxation, and preventing nations from assuring economic security, rawcapitalism strikes at the very foundation of a healthy democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theresurgence of predatory capitalism was not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the Great Depression, the U.S. government harnessed capitalism to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under Roosevelt’s New Deal, labor unions were legalized, and capitalregulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well into the 1950s and ’60s, the Western world combined athriving economy with a secure and growing middle class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning in the1970s, as deregulated capitalism regained the upper hand, elites began to dominate politics once again; policy reversals followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The inequality and instability that ensued would eventually, in 2016, cause disillusionedvoters to support far-right faux populism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is today’s poisonous alliance ofreckless finance and ultranationalism inevitable? Or can we find the political will to make capitalism serve democracy, and not the other way around? Charting a plan for bold action based on political precedent, CanDemocracy Survive Global Capitalism? is essential reading for anyoneeager to reverse the decline of democracy in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.Share This Book About The Author Robert Kuttner Robert Kuttner, cofounder and coeditor of The American Prospect, is a former columnist for Business Week, the WashingtonPost, and the Boston Globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He holds the Idaand Meyer Kirstein Chair at BrandeisUniversity, and lives in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $27.95 (Hardcover) Published: April 10, 2018 Publisher: W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Norton &amp; Company Pages: 384 ISBN 10: 0393609936 ISBN 13: 9780393609936What We Say The latest book from the co-founder of The American Prospect is enraging, enlightening and encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's also a little messy and wildly ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuttner begins with an unnecessary x-ray of President Trump's election, with the usual flurry ofpolls and breakdown of voters; then it provides a history of the post-WW II era and how and why the US economy flourishedlike never before or since; jumps to a wide-ranging look at how global capitalism and corporate elites have undermined democracy and the rule of law all over the globe (aided and abetted by centrists and demagogues alike) and winds up with a quick prescription for what ails us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other than the opening chapter on the election, it's all essential and gripping, if densewith information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuttner argues that global capitalism is the enemy of democracy -- it has outstripped the ability ofnations to regulate their own economies and deliver on the social compact of providing for their citizens and planning theirfuture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When workers suffer because of this, they blame politicians and the government and the Other (immigrants, Muslims, anyone not like them), not multinational corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are the rigs ruled against workers? Oh yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for forty years after World War II, the rules in the US favored society as a whole and Kuttner shows why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rare convergence ofpolicies made it happen: very strict regulation of finance as the servant of the economy (rather than the master), strongunions that counter-balanced the power of the elites and the activist role of the government in overseeing and encouragingboth economic policy and the social benefits (Social Security, the GI Bill and the like) that grow from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those were CHOICES and those choices can be made again, Kuttner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those choices have been dismantled since the 1970s by Republicans and centrist Democrats alike, from Jimmy Carter (who cut the capital gains tax more than Reagan) to BarackObama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuttner passionately shares the history and dismal current state of affairs to show what was done in the past andwhat can most definitely be done again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The right choices will benefit society, the broad economy (as opposed to the personal wealth of the 1%) and democracy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe it won't send you off to read up on economist Michal Kalecki the way it did me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet this book is challenging, rewarding and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problems democracy face don't seem soinsurmountable when you know they've been solved before. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Democracies govern nations, while global capitalism runs the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Kuttner provides a clear-eyed, intellectually riveting account of how the inevitable tensions between the two have fueled neofascistnationalism here and abroad, and why the response must be a new progressive populism rooted in democracy and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Timely and compelling. - Robert B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reich, chancellor’s professor of public policy, University of California at Berkeley Robert Kuttner combines economic acumen, a gift for narrative, and genuine passion in his persuasive new book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his telling, the issue isn’t whether national economies should be open to foreign trade or finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’swhether the rules of the global economy are set up to benefit?ordinary citizens or merely economic elites. -Jacob S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hacker, Yale University and coauthor of Winner-Take-All Politics Kuttner brilliantly brings together two strands of thought: explaining both the economics and politics of globalcapitalism and how our society has abandoned core principles of fairness and equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rise of inequalityhelped pave the way for Donald Trump—a figure out of step with basic American values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuttner reminds us ofthe urgency with which we need to get back to a more just society. - Joseph E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stiglitz, Columbia University, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and best-selling author of The Price of Inequality Standing on the shoulders of Karl Polanyi, Bob Kuttner revives the lost art of political economy in this absorbing and important analysis of wild markets, assaults on labor, and profound changes to institutional rules. - Ira Katznelson, Columbia University and author of the Bancroft Prize–winning Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time Democracy is no longer writing the rules for capitalism; instead it is the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With his deep insight and wide learning, Kuttner is among our best guides for understanding how we reached this point and what’s at stake if we stay on our current path. - Heather McGhee, president of Demos Conventional wisdom has it that our income disparities and dysfunctional politics are the consequence of inexorable and uncontrollable developments in technology, market competition, and globalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Robert Kuttner argues in this superb book, they are instead the result of our own policy choices. - Dani Rodrik, Harvard University and author of Straight Talk on Trade and The Globalization Paradox What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
