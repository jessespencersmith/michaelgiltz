                <p>Newer Post Older PostSUNDAY, MARCH 25, 2018 The 43rd Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS FOR 2017 The 43st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2017 The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the best films of the year since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officially known as the New York Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs -- it is more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics and more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies released in New York City in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note that caveat: though IRA members are now dispersed across the country, its roots are in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a film to be eligible it must pass one test and one test only -- a commercial release of at least one week in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Streaming may upend that rule in some way soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this explains -- for example -- why the unjustly overlooked 2016 film The Founder copped two IRA awards voted on in March of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it came out in LA in 2016 for Oscar consideration, but it wasn't released commercially in NYC until 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Michael Keaton drama about the early days of the McDonald's restaurant chain came and went from theaters over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can catch it online or on DVD or on demand any time you want, just like virtually everything else on our list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So no excuses! The IRA goes to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best Picture: BPM Best Director: Robin Campillo for BPM Best Actor: Michael Keaton for The Founder Best Actress: Daniela Vega for A Fantastic Woman (Una Mujer Fantástica) Best Supporting Actor: Willem Dafoe for The Florida Pr oject Best Supporting Actress: Lesley Manville for Phantom Thr ead Best Nonfiction Film: Dawson City: Frozen Time Best Screenplay: Robert Siegel for The Founder Best Cinematography: Alexis Zabe for The Florida Pr oject Best Production Design: Stephonik Youth for The Florida Project Best Score/Use Of Music: Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never for Good Time Best Editing: Robin Campillo, Stéphanie Léger and Anita Roth for BPM Best Costumes: Pascaline Chavanne for Frantz Sominex Award (The Movie That Put Us To Sleep): The Post Dramamine Award (The Movie That Made Us Sick): mother! Mechanical Actress: Emma Watson for Beauty and the Beast and The Circle Mechanical Actor: James Franco for The Disaster Artist, et. al This year featured an unprecedented infusion of new blood: John and David and Julia and Jim, to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four new members in one year is the most in decades and perhaps the most ever in IRA history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would they fit in or simply be offended by sophomoric insults, crude comments unworthy of progressive sensibilities and faux Algonquin Circle stabs at wit? Would an eight+ hour evening at the IRAs seem more like 80 hours of hell, never to be repeated? Despite the delicious bundt cake courtesy of Andy? With John proffering up obscure titles some had never heard of (a classic IRA bona fide and no mean feat when members attend film festivals and haunt art houses) and David, Julia and Jim chalking up their own scathing comments, strategic balloting and caustic votes by the end of the night, the answer was clearly yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eight different films received at least one IRA award, including: BPM Dawson City: Frozen Time A Fantastic Woman The Florida Project The Founder Frantz Good Time Phantom Thread But that only tells half the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, Call Me By Your Name was a contender in seven different categories, coming within an agonizing one vote of tying the ultimate winner in Best Actor and coming in second three different times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So check out all the films that received nominations and you'll see a terrific cross-section of the best films of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We argue and campaign and grumble over winners we disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the point of the IRAs is to recommend films to each other worth checking out...and then impose an arbitrary deadline to create a false sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, you have to screen that Albanian documentary because the IRAs are mere days away! So here are the winners and nominees in every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost all are available on DVD, streaming services or on demand with minimal fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's never been easier to see the best films of the year and we hope you dive deep into our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover some gems and of course watch some that you passionately disagree with, but that's half the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the IRA goes to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PICTURE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BPM -- 42 pts. (out of a possible 65 pts.) 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Florida Project -- 29 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Call Me By Your Name -- 21 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Founder -- 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Land Of Mine -- 13 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: This year thirteen ballots were submitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With a top score for each film of 5 pts, the maximum any one film could achieve in any category was 65 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs are voted on from Best Costumes up to Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So this award comes towards the end of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, you can justify any winner ( BPM crushed the competition in the editing category -- it was obvious this would win!) and explain away any loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Florida Project scored impressive early wins (it really was eye- popping on a small budget, hence wins for Cinematography and Production Design) and Call Me By Your Name was a lurking presence all night ready to play spoiler right up to the final votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with 13 people voting, BPM appeared on the vast majority of ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Passionately embraced by many, admired by virtually everyone, this was a very popular winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DIRECTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Campillo for BPM -- 45 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Baker for The Florida Project -- 25 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luca Guadagnino for Call Me By Your Name -- 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Lowery for A Ghost Story -- 13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Lee Hancock for The Founder -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: While the IRA voters are not officially signatories to the International Code Of Auteurs, they do tend to link picture and director pretty strongly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That happened again this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Florida Project and Call Me By Your Name and perhaps The Founder were clearly contenders...until the Best Director Vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BPM almost doubled the points of runner-up Sean Baker (whose film Tangerine won Best Picture just two years ago) with an impressive 45 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That appeared especially impressive because one year earlier we had a only eight voters submitting ballots which meant point totals were correspondingly smaller than this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence the call for new voters and the hefty jump in ballots to thirteen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any case, nearly doubling the points of the runner-up is a huge statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Campillo made a great film, of course, but he was also admired for his screenwriting contributions to films by director Laurent Cantet like The Class, Time Out and Heading South, not to mention Campillo's previous films Eastern Boys and an early directorial effort Les Revenants that inspired both French and US TV series called The Returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a lot of goodwill to build upon with a breakout feature that also won the Cesar for Best Film but was wrongly ignored by the Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With this decisive win, it seemed likely that BPM would take the top prize handily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Keaton for The Founder -- 38 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Timothée Chalamet for Call Me By Your Name -- 37 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nahuel Pérez Biscayart for BPM -- 33 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Pattinson for Good Time --14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Josh O'Connor for God's Own Country -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: All year IRA voter Aaron had been touting The Founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film was given an Oscar qualifying run in LA in 2016 but was roundly ignored by critics, despite the director John Lee Hancock having a serious commercial record, Keaton coming off hot Oscar winners Birdman and Spotlight (both Best Picture winners) AND the film itself being about the birth of the fast food chain McDonald's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With critics ignoring it, the film was dumped in January of 2017 and disappeared as fast as a Happy Meal tossed at a hungry tyke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OK, so it was an ultimately jaundiced view of capitalism where you slowly realize the hero of the film may not be a "bad guy" strictly speaking but that capitalism isn't concerned with good guys or bad guys or quality but just winners and losers and everyone likes a winner and the winner is the guy that makes the most money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So maybe it was never gonna be a triumph at the multiplex. ("Mom, where's Ronald McDonald? Where's the Hamburglar?") But tub-thumping by one member kept prodding others to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slowly they did and each time the verdict was the same: that's a really good film and Keaton's performance is about the best he's ever done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a nail-biter with fans of Call Me By Your Name touting the hot young talent Timothée Chalamet and the fact that everyone loved BPM and its lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Keaton prevailed with one of the closest votes of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniela Vega for A Fantastic Woman (Una Mujer Fantástica) -- 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danielle Macdonald for Patti Cake$-- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cynthia Nixon for A Quiet Passion -- 17 pts. 4. (tie) Sally Hawkins for Maudie and The Shape Of Water -- 16 pts. (tie) Paula Beer for Frantz -- 16 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Ok, so this time the IRAs and Oscar are almost in accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Academy Awards named Una Mujer Fantástica the Best Foreign Film and the IRAs crowned the fantasic Daniela Vega as Best Actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be interesting to see if Chilean cinema can find other projects for Vega that don't depend on her back story to power the project. (She also appeared on stage in a work about transgender people that ultimately ran for years.) Vega edged past Danielle Macdonald and her rapping abilities in Patti Cake$, as well as the best performance by a potential future Governor of New York courtesy of Cynthia Nixon. (She was about the only element of that film anyone liked.) And right behind them was Paula Beer in the respected French film Frantz by director Francois Ozon, a prolific talent who is actually making good movies again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Sally Hawkins was at the center of a tug-of-war over The Shape Of Water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the veteran IRA members really liked this film, prompting the worried question by others, "In the end, do we all become like Academy voters?" No insisted others, who thought Hawkins was terrific in the little-seen film Maudie (co-starring IRA favorite Ethan Hawke) but couldn't stand The Shape Of Water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only the churlish would say any problems with the film were her fault but the IRAs do not lack for the churlish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the snide youngsters should remember that just last year both IRA and the Oscars named Moonlight the best film of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Willem Dafoe for The Florida Project -- 35 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Stuhlbarg for Call Me By Your Name -- 31 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barry Keoghan for The Killing Of A Sacred Deer -- 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caleb Landry Jones for American Made and The Florida Project and Get Out and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri -- 12 pts. 5. (tie) Rob Morgan for Mudbound -- 11 pts. (tie) Arnaud Valois for BPM -- 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Two winners at the IRAs were nominated in the same category at the Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Oscar got it wrong both times, failing to honor either Willem Dafoe in The Florida Project (and otherwise ignoring that film entirely) or Lesley Manville in Phantom Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it's just an honor to be nominated! At this stage of the evening, The Florida Project had scored nominations and won three (or four, depending on how you count) of those seven, making it an early favorite to dominate the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, BPM had been nominated in four categories and won Best Editing so it and The Founder and scrappy, always-the-bridesmaid Call Me By Your Name all demonstrated enough strength to make clear the night was far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bria Vinaite for The Florida Project -- 26 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RESCINDED 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lesley Manville for Phantom Thread -- 24 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laurie Metcalfe for Lady Bird -- 22 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holly Hunter for The Big Sick -- 21 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allison Janney for I, Tonya -- 18 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VOTE TO RESCIND -- By a majority vote, the top vote getter is replaced by the runner-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lesley Manville for Phantom Thread is the official winner of Best Supporting Actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More drama ensues than was ever seen on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The IRAs have the RESCIND option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After every winner is announced, an automatic vote to rescind is held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a majority of members present vote to rescind, that award is rescinded and the runner-up is crowned the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a vote to rescind THAT winner is held and so on until the vote to rescind fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, Bria Vinaite garnered the most points for her widely admired work as the desperate, train wreck of a mother in The Florida Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Close behind was Lesley Manville in the generally disliked PTA film Phantom Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was already clear that The Florida Project was a huge favorite and coming up was a potential win for Willem Dafoe in Best Supporting Actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The feeling of a sweep -- those years where one film gobbles up awards in almost every category it can -- was strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe that explains the weird success of the vote to rescind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most liked The Florida Project and most who did certainly thought Vinaite was great in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps a combination of those debating if she was a lead or supporting performer as well as those who liked Manville AND those who hate to see one film dominate every award is the reason seven people voted to rescind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manville was now the official winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To the chagrin of some, the vote to rescind HER and crown Laurie Metcalf for her excellent work on Lady Bird fell short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hoping for two successful Rescind votes in a row is a fool's errand and that gambit failed here, not for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST NONFICTION FILM 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dawson City: Frozen Time -- 30 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Portrait Photography -- 17 pts. 3. (tie) In Transit -- 10 pts. (tie) Jane -- 10 pts. (tie) Risk -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The Best Nonfiction Film is a recent add to the IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The explosion in documentary, experimental and other non-narrative films made it seem essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, nonfiction films had snagged the top prize before, including the landmark documentary Eyes On The Prize (which had a theatrical run before airing on PBS) and Bill Morrison's Decasia .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here is Morrison again, doing his usual magic with found footage of crumbling movie stock while telling the story of the gold rush town Dawson City, its many links to Hollywood and the discovery of a cache of silent film reels decades after the town's heyday had come and gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still the category was added in the hope it would encourage more viewing of documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of yet -- given the many ballots that didn't even include five nominees -- it seems to have merely put those films in a ghetto of their own, a la the Best Animated Film at the Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would Dawson City: Frozen Time have made our Top Five films if it hadn't already been honored in its own category? We'll never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCREENPLAY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Siegel for The Founder -- 31 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Campillo and Philippe Mangeot for BPM -- 20 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Ivory for Call Me By Your Name -- 19 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Baker (ampersand) Chris Bergoch for The Florida Project --15 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emily V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gordon (ampersand) Kumail Nanjiani for The Big Sick -- 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The John Lee Hancock film had two key assets: the lead performance by Michael Keaton and the subtle screenplay by Robert Siegel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In retrospect, the awards were parsed out very wisely, honoring different films for their strengths rather than letting the best movie of the year simply sweep aside all comers, which is always kind of boring, no matter how great any particular film might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Founder's win here is a great example of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexis Zabe for The Florida Project -- 31 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sayombhu Mukdeeprom for Call Me By Your Name -- 22 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Darius Khondji for The Lost City Of Z -- 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeanne Lapoirie for BPM -- 13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mikhail Krichman for Loveless -- 12 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: We live in a golden age for cinematography so this category is often hotly contested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so, this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Call Me By Your Name had cinematography that benefited greatly from both real estate porn and the visceral appeal of Chalamet and Hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lost City Of Z had the visual sweep of a Hollywood epic despite an indie budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BPM was thrilling in its blurring of work and protest and life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Loveless gave the bleakness of modern Russia an almost tactile feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a lot of impressive films, the marvelous work of The Florida Project (look ma, no phone!) was the clear favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only real question was how much credit went to the cinematographer of record Alexis Zabe and how much goes to director Sean Baker, who is seen operating the camera in almost every still image one sees from the movie's set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephonik Youth for The Florida Project -- 29 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Corenblith for The Founder -- 28 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel Deshors for Call Me By Your Name -- 18 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Austerberry for The Shape Of Water -- 12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harley Jessup for Coco -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Again, The Florida Project came out on top, though the spot-on work of The Founder came damn close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story of McDonald's was period without being kitsch, while The Florida Project gave the run- down sections of Orlando the colorful magic of a world seen through a kid's eyes...without ignoring the poverty of their situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The animated film Coco was a modestly controversial choice but hey -- those films don't design themselves just because they're animated! BEST SCORE/USE OF MUSIC 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never for Good Time - - 17 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jonny Greenwood for Phantom Thread -- 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Philippe Rombi for Frantz -- 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Binnick and Jeremy Gasper for Patti Cake$ -- 11 pts. 5. (tie) Daniel Hart for A Ghost Story --8 pts. (tie) Alexandre Desplat for The Shape Of Water --8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The category of Best Score was recently renamed Best Score/Use Of Music to accommodate the endless ways in which films make use of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got original scores like Phantom Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got original scores that employ a ticking clock in a rather modern fashion but then pull out a key piece of classical music at the film's high point, as in Dunkirk and its use of Elgar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got Call Me By Your Name, which uses an original score, period songs played prominently (like "Love My Way" by the Psychedelic Furs) alongside original new songs by Sufjan Stevens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got Frantz which has an original score and classical pieces performed by the characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got Patti Cake$ which has a score, some original raps and some contemporary hip hop songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got full-on musicals like The Greatest Showman and Coco .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you've got Baby Driver, which made clever use of setting action scenes to the beat of classic tunes both offbeat and familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of those films don't fall into a neat category of Best Score versus Best Use Of Pre-Existing Music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence the IRA decision to say, "Consider the many ways a film uses music and make your choice accordingly." Hey if it's 1968 and you think Kubrick's use of pre-existing pieces in 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best use of music, make your case. (You'd be right.) If you think Ennio Morricone's original score for Once Upon A Time In The West is better, fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you prefer Yellow Submarine 's perfect capturing of the Beatles and their vibe by showcasing classic tunes (and a few so-so originals), tell everyone else they're crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Short of creating two or three (or four?) music categories and finding out most can't name five worthy nominees for each, what are you gonna do? The winner this year? Good Time, which triumphed thanks to a terrific electronic score by the artist Oneohtrix Point Never, including an original song featuring Iggy Pop that was so spot-on I actually assumed it was a pre-existing Iggy classic I simply didn't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST EDITING 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Campillo, Stéphanie Léger and Anita Roth for BPM -- 37 pts. 2. (tie) Sean Baker for The Florida Project -- 17 pts. (tie) Tatiana S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riegel for I, Tonya -- 17 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronald Bronstein and Benny Safdie for Good Time -- 14 pts. 5. (tie) David Lowery for A Ghost Story -- 10 pts. (tie) Andrew Weisblum for mother! -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Documentaries often score highly in the editing category because they typically include a wealth of footage and the movie is "discovered" in the editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so this year, which may reflect a weak year for documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With BPM winning by a vote total more than double The Florida Project (and Call Me By Your Name and The Founder nowhere in sight), this was the early category that tea leaf readers could examine and see exactly where we'd end up come Best Picture and Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST COSTUME 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pascaline Chavanne for Frantz -- 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Bridges for Phantom Thread -- 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniel Orlandi for The Founder -- 19 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fernando Rodriguez for The Florida Project -- 15 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Holly Waddington for Lady Macbeth -- 14 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: While the work on the Oscar-winning Phantom Thread was exquisite, the category is Best Costume, not Best Couture Collection, which may be why the subtler but still lovely work in Frantz narrowly won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Post -- 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Darkest Hour -- 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Florida Project -- 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Professor Marston and the Wonder Women -- 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wonderstruck -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick) . mother! -- 14 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Detroit -- 12 pts. 3.

Mudbound Patti Cake$ Phantom Thr ead A Quiet Passion Risk The Shape Of W ater Three Billboar ds Outside Ebbing, Missouri WHO OR WHAT ARE THE IRAS? A HISTORY The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the best films of the year since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officially known as the New York Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs -- it is more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies released in New York City in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story lost in the mist of time.) The IRAs has been profiled in The New Yorker so it is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of it .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best- selling and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics, screenwriters, budding playwrights, plain old film buffs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are passionate film lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many have careers involving the arts but it's not always easy to stay in the swim of things and keep on top of the flood of new releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) on some streaming service or DVD if you miss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life, before jobs and family made claims on their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you want to stay on top of great cinema every year or explore its history, there's no better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the year than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they've been doing it for decades so, hey, it's tradition!
