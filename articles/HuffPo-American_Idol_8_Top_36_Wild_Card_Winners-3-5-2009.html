Read More: American Idol , Kara DioGuardi , Paula Abdul, Pop Music , Randy Jackson , Reality TV , Simon Cowell , Entertainment News OK, so the wild card round was tonight and four more people got through: Jasmine, Megan, Mattand Anoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yep, it's a Top 13! Jesse -- Singing "Tell Me Something Good" with a little too much makeup but otherwise looking cute, Jesse was working too hard to be a soulmama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you've got it, it comes effortlesslyand you NEVER look like you're trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randywas mixed but the other three were stronger, with Simon saying she was indulgent but still glad he put her through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least she learned to shut hermouth when the judges were talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matt -- Sang the Jackson Five while dressed like Justin Timberlake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the judges thought he was a thousand times better though Simon did not like his look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought he was better too but wasn't that enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan -- Sang the unlikely KT Tunstall gem "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree," an odd choice for someone who claims to be a country gal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katharine McPhee was a revelation when she did it but I felt Megan was reaching for the bluesiness and flat in places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paula gave the half-hearted "I enjoyedwatching you," Kara gave her a huge plug to go through while Simon and Randy liked her despitethe vocal weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? Von -- Von kept the hair towering high while singing "Sorry Seems To The Hardest Word" at a key that was even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just the key he chose was dreadful and probably ruined his chances because it caused him to sing in a strange falsetto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did get better in the lower register but not enough.Simon put the kibosh right away and the other judges agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Serious Paula showed up here: "I'vebeen studying the way you perform...." Kara really has allowed her to become unexpectedly sober.Simon even referenced Paula as the house expert by saying he asked Paula what Von originallyperformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bye Von, come back next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jasmine -- Singing "Reflection" by Christina Aguilera and looking lovely but not too dressed up, Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Stephen Colbert Rips Apart Glenn Beck: Building His Career On 9/11 (VIDEO) Stephen Colbert rippedapart Fox News host (andNew York...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin Disinvited,Newt Gingrich In For Major GOP Dinner WASHINGTON -- Alaska Gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Palin is out, and former House Speaker Newt...

Did the judges make the right choice? Personally, none of them blew me away at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the live, immediate decisions by the judges made it a fun hour of TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tatiana kneeling down in front of the judges while Paula told her she was going to go places and even be an actress (duh!) almost made dealing with the girl worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Anoop's stunned double take when he knew he was gone only to find out there'd be a Top 13 was priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Watch Idol Performances Get Clips From The Idol Results Show w/the Free Videos Toolbar people like...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Touching the Queenwasn't the only...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; April Fools 2009!
