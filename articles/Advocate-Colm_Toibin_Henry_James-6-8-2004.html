'r 3 Hot reads Regarding Henry I rish novelist Colm T 6ibin talks about writing The Master, his riveting journey into the mind of America's great gay writer Henry James By Michael Giltz Perhaps it was fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acclaimed Irish au­ thor Colm T6ibin was slyly dubbed "the Henry James of Enniscor­ thy" back in 1999 by The [London 1 In­ dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he has boldly tackled the life of that legendary 19th-century novelist in The Master (Scribner, $25). concealed his own attraction to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For T6ibin, who fIrst wrote about James in a piece collect­ ed in his book of essays and ar­ ticles Love in a Dark Time (Simon &amp; Schuster, $24), The Master was a chance to reclaim the life of a writer who removed almost all traces of his sexuality from his fiction. "I couldn't see how you could do it as a novelist," ad­ mits T6ibin. "It just seemed an astonishing level of artistry, the levels of self-effacement involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He does give it away in places-he's so in­ terested in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if secrets are told, they will be so destructive and so explo­ sive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In my own case, I ex­ ploded, I suppose." T6ibfn is already recog­ nized as an author of the first rank in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His third novel, The Story of the Night, was picked by the Publishing Triangle as one of the 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And his most recent, The Blackwater Lightship, was short­ listed for the Booker Prize and turned Like Michael Cunning- into a lovely TV film, star- ham's The Hours, which ring Dianne Wiest and An- captured the inner life of gela Lansbury, that aired Virginia Woolf, T6ibin's earlier this year on CBS. book brilliantly delves Now advance reviews into the mind of James, for The Master make clear the razor-sharp observer this fifth novel by the 49- of the treachery beneath year-old writer should be the elegance of the Gild- his breakthrough work in ed Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In such novels as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pub- The Golden Bowl, The lishers Weekly calls it "riv- Portrait of a Lady, and eting" and says, "The sub- The Wings of the Dove, tlety and empathy with James portrayed a world Closeted master Henry James which T6ibin inhabits in which naivete and openness lead to I James's psyche and captures the fleeting ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And James was himself a creature emotional nuances of his world are be- of that secretive world: All his life he yond praise." THE ADVOCATE 1541 JUNE 8, 2004 @ @ It was three novels into his career that T6ibfn tackled gay issues himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, an editor and friend urged T6ibfn to deal with gay life after writing two novels-The South and The Heather Blazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'd made his name and admirably tackled Ireland's history but seemed to avoid the heart of who he was. "Coming out" in his fiction felt to T6ibfn like coming out of a box. "I must say, it was greeted with im­ mense relief by everyone I knew, be­ cause people were so glad: 'He's finally fucking written about it,'" laughs T6ibfn, who lives in Dublin and spends his sum­ mers in the Pyrenees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he says, "I'm probably going to write my next two books where it won't be a subject." Being gay is the unspoken subtext of James's entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; T6ibin shows him subtly attracted to a manservant, listen­ ing to gossip about Oscar Wilde's trial, spending a tension-filled night lying naked in bed next to future Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and yearning quietly for a gorgeous young sculptor. "I'm obviously interested in the gay past and what can be done with it," says T6ibin. "There's very little that we know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point I suddenly realized this is a really great story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a very dra­ matic business being Henry James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And once I saw it as a story you could tell, I thought I could actually do this." Indeed, James is compelled by his mother to feign illness to avoid fighting in the Civil War, suffers the painful deaths and suicides of both family mem­ bers and mends, and deals with the in­ dignities of colossal failure on the Lon­ don stage. (T6ibfn himself, ironically, is writing a play for the Abbey Theatre­ something he'd never considered be­ fore.) But James's professional failure at drama can't compare to the personal failure of an empty emotional-and physical-life. "I'd love to have given him one big shag in the book, one major shag," says T6ibfn, who is single. "But it couldn't be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One long night of licking and sucking and fucking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not a hope of it, I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasn't true to the spirit of him." • Giltz is a regular contributor to several periodicals, including the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE ADVOCATE I &amp;Ii</p>
