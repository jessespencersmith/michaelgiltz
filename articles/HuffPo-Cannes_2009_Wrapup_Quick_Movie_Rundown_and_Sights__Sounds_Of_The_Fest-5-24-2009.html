What a great subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bring it on, I can talk about it for hours." FUNNIEST MOMENT ON THE BEACHThree young women gasp with delight and literally stop in their tracks when they spot a giant billboard promoting Peter Jackson's upcoming movie The Lovely Bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First girl, excitedly: " The Lovely Bones! Oh my God!" Second girl, informatively: "That was a book." Third girl, dimly: "I read part of it but I never finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They turned it into a movie?" BEST POSTERS FOR UPCOMING MOVIES ROUNDUP #1 Hitler Goes Kaput! Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are UndeadHigh Kick Girl! is from the producers of Shaolin Girl (I spot a trend) and features a Buffy-like young Asian woman in a school girl skirt delivering a powerful kick sky high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tagline: "She is more than just a cute high school girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is a master of Karate!" MOST HUMANIZING MOMENTLars Von Trier spent half his press conference responding to indignant questions about his new film Anti-Christ. (Saying you were outraged by a Lars Von Trier film is like saying you went to a John Waters film and found it in poor taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What the hell did you expect?) He (sort of) joked that he was the best film director in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was said wryly, but he later made clear that this is the sort of self-confidence and ego you need in order to make a movie and he was sure that otherdirectors felt the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Willem Dafoe later referred to Von Trier as "a great director,"Von Trier interrupted him and said, "the greatest" to much laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amid all the hullabaloo, people often forgot that Von Trier discussed having a nervous breakdown and believing for a while that he'd never make a movie again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And almost no one mentioned that during the entire pressconference, you could see his hands trembling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He may be a provocateur, but he's also human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE FRENCH APPROACH TO BUSINESSI love grabbing a freshly baked croissant on my way to the first screening of the day, which usually takes place at the ungodly hour of 8:30 am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For various reasons, that wasn't happening this year soI went looking for a croissant AFTER the first or second screening of the day, anywhere from 11 am They Played Presidents: Who Was Believable?

I need to make more croissants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll make more money!" But the French say,"Voila! My work is done and I can spend more time sitting and chatting with friends." I was frustrated about not getting that croissant but couldn't help appreciating their approach to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, my last two favorite bakeries in Cannes have since gone out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRAZIEST PRESS CONFERENCE MOMENTAt the press conference for Ang Lee's Taking Woodstock, a Brazilian journalist gave a soccer jersey of the great player Ronaldo to Emile Hirsch for no apparent reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He didn't ask Hirsch a question, Hirsch doesn't play soccer in the movie and it wasn't clear if the journalist was doing this himself or for Ronaldo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then he talked about Ang Lee's many movies with homosexual themes and asked, "Would you ever realize another kind of Hulk with Brokeback elements, something like this guy?" and then held up a Hulk action figure he had painted all pink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once everyone stopped laughing, Lee actually gave an interesting answer. "Inside everybody is very complicated," said Lee. "We're all kinds of Hulks with many different elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm fascinated by some great stories and they happen to revolve around homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just fascinates me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't go inside and examinewhat exactly is -- I just portray them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope people will respond in a very complex way to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This movie [ Taking Woodstock ] will have that too [the lead character is gay].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's not an essential core problem or issue as in Brokeback Mountain. " Then he laughs and adds, "If you examine Hulk , I'm sure there's some homo problem there too." BEST POSTERS FOR UPCOMING MOVIES ROUNDUP #2Gladiators Versus Werewolves Just Peck, with the tagline: "In suburbia, no one can hear you scream" Gangster Exchange, which pictures two tough guys walking down an alley with one of them splattered in blood and carrying...a toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tagline: "Guns, thugs, and toilets made of drugs."That explains that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lesbian Vampire Killers, which asks, reasonably enough, "What more could you possibly want?" THE HOLLYWOOD/BOLLYWOOD CROSSOVER CONTINUESThe Italian Job is getting remade for the Indian market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which means there has been a British version, the original Italian Job; an American remake starring Mark Wahlberg and now a Hindi version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, as of yet, still no Italian version of The Italian Job.Another Hindi film announced at Cannes is Kambakkht Ishq, a big budget Bollywood musical featuring big US stars in the story of an Indian stuntman who takes Hollywood by storm but still can't leap, dive or dodge his way into a woman's heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the US actors set to appear are Denise Richards, Brandon Routh (I guess that next Superman movie has been delayed) and...waitfor it, Sylvester Stallone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they get him to sing and dance, I'm in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BOOKS I READ TO PREPARE FOR CANNES OR WHILE STANDING IN LINE FOR A MOVIE We Wish To Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories From Rwanda by Philip Gourevitch **** Push [aka Precious] by Sapphire ** 1/2 Mussolini by Denis Mack Smith *** (out of four) Taking Woodstock by Eliot Tiber ** (but fun) Keats by Andrew Motion *** 1/2 The Complete Poems Of John Keats *** Lindsay Lohan Video Michael Jackson Cars Transparency iPhone Religion Iraq Sarah Palin MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author On the ball: with his new play All That I Will EverBe, a post-Six Feet UnderAlan Ball proves there'slife afterdeath.(THEATER): Anarticle from: The ...

You're going to go in that direction? You're not coming with me?" He stared at her blankly, not giving away his intentions in the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She feinted again and then finally, angrily started walking away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sighed,put on his earplugs and then started walking in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was going his way and two blocks later he suddenly stopped, turned around completely and stared back the way he came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hadn't she turned around to follow him? I couldn't resist stopping to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nope, she hadn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hesitated, sighed and then -- defeated -- started to walk back after her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I'd had a movie camera with me, it would have made a perfect short film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST UNEXPECTED SOURCE OF SUSPENSEThe dictionary that takes center stage in the gripping 15+ minute scene that ends the brilliant Police, Adjective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MOVIE MOMENT I CAN'T SHAKE It happened during the very first screening, which was the world premiere of the latest Pixar film Up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, an old man is living on his own after his beloved wife died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were each other's world and had no children, so he has literally no one, just a small home slowly being surrounded by skyscrapers and some personal belongings, like the mailbox in their front yard they decorated together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a construction worker accidentally knocks the mailbox over, the old man -- impotent with age, hard of hearing, and grumpy by nature -- loses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worker apologizes andtries to fix it, but the old man is furious that the guy is even touching something so important tohim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They get in an unintentional tug of war and the old man momentarily lashes out, hitting the worker with his walking cane and drawing blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People rush to help the worker and the old man is frightened and scared; he knows he's messed up and something as simple as a small accident likethis can leave him powerless and in the hands of the authorities who will undoubtedly decide he needs to be placed in a nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a quiet, powerful scene that takes place early in the film and it captures with heartbreaking precision the vulnerability and fear that can overtake you whenyou're old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After years of success and control, you become like a little child again and strangersinsist on telling you what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Few movies have ever captured the minefield that is old age as adroitly as Up , which is one more reason why the first film of the fest will surely be one of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MY SHORT FILM, A SURE-FIRE WINNER AT NEXT YEAR'S CANNESHere's the short film I shot at Cannes that's certain to be a winner at next year's festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wrote, directed, edited and star in it, a la Orson Welles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a little more action-packed than most moviesthat play here, but it's certainly in the same vein as the other films at Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since I can't sneakyou into screenings of the films in Competition, this is as close as you can get at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enjoy, thanks for reading and au revoir!Michael Giltz: Cannes 2009 Wrapup: Quick Movie Rundown and Sights &amp; Sounds Of The Fest http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/cannes-2009-wrapup-quick_b_207222.html [7/21/2009 5:46:48 PM] Emma Watson Is Going to College At...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony Bids $50 Million For Michael Jackson...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Jessica Parker And Matthew Broderick's Night...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom Cruise And Kids Join Beckham Family...Related News On Huffington Post: 'The White Ribbon' Wins Palme d'Or At 2009 CannesCANNES, France â€” Austrian director Michael Haneke's somber drama "The White Ribbon" claimed the top prize Sunday at the Cannes Film Festival, where Quentin Tarantino...

(Oh: Even earlier inmy career I worked for the organization that processed accreditation for Americans who wanted toattend the Festival -- press, producers, sales people, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So once upon a time, I was the guy whodecided how important each person was and, ultimately, what tickets they received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I didn't knowmuch of anything, at the time.) Many years it rains all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when it doesn't, the mistral blowsthe pollen down the hills and gives people migraine headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In summary, it's an odd experience.Not what one expects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Hi, if you click on my name at the top of the piece, it takes you to every post I've done forHuffington, in reverse chronological order (the most recent at the top).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each day at the fest Ifiled reviews, so you can go Cannes 2009 Day One and Day Two and so on and read all myindividual reviews as they ran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting. discourse jockey I'm a Fan of discourse jockey permalink "Up" on #2 ??

I haven't seen the film myself, but sometimes the best films of the year are animated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the author's vivid description, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's versatile and complicated format to do consistently and well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most countries in the world beyond America see animation as an ADULT format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe you grew up expecting all animated films to have singing bunny rabbits and bad plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sorry, things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best of the best animation films are amazing works of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't open yourself to that, you're doing a disservice to yourself. discourse jockey I'm a Fan of discourse jockey permalink Nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's precisely why most Americananimation in general and "Up" in particular is in my book of atrocious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not a snob here at all, just someone who firmly believes that there can --at times-- be such a thing as right and wrong even when it comes to personal taste.Liking "Up" is ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Touting it as an "important" film, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Well, you can't always agree with any critic, (not even yourself, since I've sometimes wildly reappraised a film I loved/hated on first view).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hopefully they can write entertainingly about movies even whenyou DON'T agree with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely the other films I covered andliked weren't all dreck? And I'm far from the only one to praise Up, it was easily one of the best reviewed films there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hollywood reporter said, "Winsome,touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, the gorgeously rendered, high-flyingadventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it."Variety says, ""Up" is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's notall about sensory bombardment and volume" and also says, "a captivating odd-coupleadventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Could easily have beencloying, but instead proves disarming in its deep reserves of narrative imagination andsurprise, as well as its poignant thematic balance of dreams deferred and dreams fulfilled."Go to any other outlet and you'll find much the same. discourse jockey I'm a Fan of discourse jockey permalink The article was very much ok otherwise, that's why that one bit stands outlike a sore tooth for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Haslowex I'm a Fan of Haslowex permalink Had you only finished your film with "Fin." ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only I were more technically proficient!
