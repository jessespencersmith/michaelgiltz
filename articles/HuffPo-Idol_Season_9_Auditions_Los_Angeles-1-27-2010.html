(We also see a brief montage of other successful candidates at the end.) Just barely morethan one good audition every 15 minutes made this show drag on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since about 22 people got throughto Hollywood, why did so few of them make the cut for air time? Two guest judges included an uninteresting Avril Lavigne and a very tart Katy Perry, who had the sharpest riposte to Kara who went on and on about the inspiring backstory of a young man: "This is not aLifetime movie!" No, but sometimes the Idol producers want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a rundown of the five people who got winning tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JIM RANGER (12 minutes in) -- Sang "Drive," an original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quick shot of Ryan shows him warning friends of Jim that it's awfully hard to impress the judges when singing an original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surprisingly, not only is Jim good, so is his song (though the judges didn't really comment on it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good raspy Southern rockvoice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annoyingly, Avril and Kara decided this father of three maybe couldn't handle committing to a rock career AND a family AND his church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uh, isn't that the same issue every person longing for a career MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | LeAnn Rimes | Levi Johnston | Movies | Creative Minds 2011 | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 6 Don't Miss Tonight's Rare Full Moon Eclipse Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Passes Senate Procedural Vote WATCH LIVE: Rare Lunar Eclipse On Winter Solstice Timothy Karr Obama FCC Caves on Net Neutrality -- Tuesday...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our Time PHOTOS: 10 Things We've Accidentally Learned From Crime Dramas Sarah Palin Jabs Michelle Obama's Anti-Obesity Campaign Like 40K Like 40K Like 7K Like 8K Like 11K Like 1K Like 5K Survivor 21: Infants vs Senior Citizens: Fetuses...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jud 'Fabio' Birza Wins 'Survivor: Nicaragua' Shania Twain Engaged To Frederic Thiebaud 'The Fighter' Star Amy Adams Talks Weight...in music faces? Whether they're a roadie or the lead singer? Do Kara and Avril only hire single people not in serious relationships for tours they're involved in? In any case, Jim had a strong audition and fills a useful niche that could carry him far if he gets by Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARY POWERS (23 minutes in) -- Sang "Love Is A Battlefield" by Pat Benatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon nailed her for looking derivative rocker-chick-ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And to me her vocals were too much of a copycat of Benatar, down to the vocal quavers. (She also had some dorky hand gestures; I hope they're just dumb and not mimicking the music video.) Powers was also a bit nervous and for all that she wasn't bad, just not distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANDREW GARCIA (39 minutes in) -- Sang "Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also a dad (though no on- air complaint from Kara about his dereliction of duty) with parents who were gang members but moved away to give their kids a better chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a heart-tugging backstory (which can turn me off) Andrew sailed effortlessly through his vocals with a sweet, controlled tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love it when people don't getall Mariah on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite strong and the best of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TASHA LAYTON (46 minutes in) -- Sang "Baby Baby Baby" by Joss Stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well-dressed woman who is a personal assistant by day and minister by night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good performance, quickie audition with no sentimental backstory but at least we got to hear her sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHRIS GOLIGHTLY -- Sang "Stand By Me" by Ben E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This young man -- who went through literally dozens of foster homes -- was the source of Katy Perry's tart "This is not a Lifetime movie" comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He keeps his eyes closed throughout most of his audition, which makes me worry about Chris'sstage presence and nerves down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was a sweet. straightforward vocal and he's appealing.Simon and Katy gave him a yes but with a small "y," but I agree more with Kara and Randy that he'spretty intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, he's already got a great last name for a pop star! So another city with only five full auditions and lots and lots of filler and clueless folk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, FOX should post the complete auditions of all 22 golden ticket winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what did you think of the five who got through?

Andrew Garcia killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought he was great, though he isn't a hunk, so his days are numbered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danny Gokey? He's got a new video on the Idol website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looks do matter of course, but Ruben Studdard won and he's no pin-up either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought Katy Perry was fantastic last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Honest, funny, no BS...and she looked amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wasgreat to hear her call out Kara one more than one occasion. her comments were right on and Iwould love to see her come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avril was annoying as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too immature, giggly, and not reallya good judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please do not have her back....ev er! I personally thought Avril was adorable in her devil hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just wanted to give her a big hug.TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Vince Vaughn's New Bundle of Joy Paris Hilton's BikerBlunder Scarlett and Ryan's DinnerDate MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Most Popular NBA Video Poverty Health 30 Rock Immigration Death &amp; Dying IslamHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESRecency | Popularity DCDan 02:00 PM on 1/28/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER ScottR 06:39 PM on 1/27/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:58 AM on 1/28/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER BobbyV123 03:04 PM on 1/27/2010 Permalink | Share it badjuggler 10:29 AM on 1/27/2010 Permalink | Share itTracy Morgan Undergoes Kidney Transplant 129 Comments Bristol Breaks Silence On Levi's New Girlfriend 172 Comments ENGAGED 234 Comments PHOTO: Kardashian Christmas Card Revealed 2,288 Comments PHOTOS: Paris Hilton Dons Leather Bodysuit 128 Comments Guess Who Got A Tattoo Of Her Daughter 752 CommentsComments are closed for this entry View All 59 Fans She did look cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just didn't find any of her comments interestin g or helpful, especially compared to Katy Perry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But maybe Im just a frustrated Idol judge/pop star.MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright Â© 2010 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:11 PM on 1/27/2010 Permalink | Share it</p>
