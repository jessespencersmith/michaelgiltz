"Rebels" -- or as I like to call them, traitors -- launched this attack which led to the Civil War, an attempt to permanently destroy the UnitedStates of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the most painful and raw andfascinating period in American history and the stream ofbooks and articles and works of art about the Civil warcontinues unabated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Abraham Lincoln alonehas been the subject of so many books it could fill agood-sized library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I once saw a movie or play or read abook in which a character was described without hyperbole as having read every single book on the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is literally impossible to do today andgrows more impossible with each passing year. (It's impossible to read 20,000 volumes; it's even more impossible to read 40,000.) But that shouldn't stop you from trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are some of the new books, albums and reissues of classic TV works on the War of Southern Aggression.

Northern troops loyal to the country and the rule of law? Ortraitors who had potentially seized a massive cache of weapons at Harper's Ferry? To make mattersworse, Lincoln wasn't even sure any Northern states would respond to his call for soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And DC itselfwas filled with traitors at all levels of government who sympathized with the South and spied for them or quit their jobs outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book by two brothers goes day by day, capturing the drama at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soldiers bivouacked inside the half-built Capitol building, the unfinished dome leaving them open to thenight skies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lincoln going amongst the few soldiers in town late at night, shaking their hands and offeringwords of comfort and praise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riots in Baltimore when Northern troops passed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clara Barton --who would found the Red Cross -- practicing her excellent marksmanship and being mocked and spatupon by fellow employees in the Patent Office who lined the halls to abuse her because she was a womanand intelligent and anti-slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those are some of the vivid moments captured here, along withnighttime raids, hijacked trains and countless missed opportunities by the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an entertainingglimpse of a key early moment in the struggle for this nation's soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One negative comment: it won'tdiminish the pleasure for casual readers, but it must be a sad reflection of tightened budgets in publishing when even a book from a notable press like Oxford can be littered with missing or repeated words and phrases and other examples of copyediting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe one advantage to ebooks would be theability to send out a cleaner version at no cost even after a book has been purchased? NOTE: Oxford University Press contacted me to say the errors in this book were the result of a miscommunication between editors and the printers; changes that were intended to be made got lost inthe shuffle on this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All changes will be corrected in later editions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were glad these errorswere not taken as a reflection on the authors and the work at hand and insist it was a one-off error andnot reflective of OUP's quality control in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shelterpop: Unplugging Appliances: Do I REALLY Have to Do This?

Both are ideal forCivil War buffs and folkies looking for unfamiliar tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A GLORIOUS ARMY: ROBERT E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEE'S TRIUMPH 1862-1863 By Jeffry D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wert ($30; Simon &amp; Schuster) -- Ironically, the book from the academic press OUP is perfect for a general audience while thebook from a more general press (Simon &amp; Schuster) is really for hardcore Civil War buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wert focuses on the year in which Lee first took command of the traitorous Confederate Army bent on splittingasunder the United States forever, leading it to one victory after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wert's prose is accessible andclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But these battle-by-battle accounts, along with his carefully judged opinions backed up by quotingfrom diaries and letters at the time or memoirs written later and other sources, will delight mostly thosewho savor every twist and turn of battle or debating the what-if of Glendale (where a mortal blow mighthave been struck against the Union Army).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wert's judgments are sober and convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also paints a picture from the start of a military campaign that was ultimately doomed by forces beyond the control of Lee or any General. (The North's advantages in factories and men, to name two.) It might appeal to onemore audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone who insists on calling this event The War Between The States might very wellenjoy a book that records one triumph after another and ends with Lee's victory at Chancellorsville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Most Popular Japan Earthquake Libya NBA Afghanistan Fast Food Gas &amp; Oil NASA Hockey MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Readers Need to Know About eBooks Like 186 mayhemstudios RT @sbeasla : What happens when you tickle a little penguin? http://j.mp/dEZjCM via @huffingtonpost twsuccess Antoine Dodson Arrested For Marijuana Possession http://huff.to/edLaIo Greg Mortenson Hospitalized: 'Three Cups Of Tea'...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sandra Bullock Furious Over Ex Jesse James's...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malcolm X: A Life Of Reinvention --...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Narrative Magazine's Friday Feature: Seven Deadly Sins...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE CIVIL WAR: COMMEMORATIVE EDITION ($99.99; PBS) -- It's only fitting that the most wrenching event in US history should inspire one of the most important works in television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Civil War by Ken Burns is simply a landmark, an epic of documentary filmmaking that has inspired virtually every work that has come in its wake and -- let's not forget -- exceptionally entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You were surely reminded of that if you watched even a minute when it was rebroadcast last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just seeing a moment can suck you right back in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's educational and informative and rigorous in its scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's also funny, tense, exciting, tear-inducing and inspiring, both as art and for making clear what a noble cause the war truly was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may have been tragic and painful on personal levels, but it was also our nation's defining hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And nothing captures that better than this film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and alsoavailable for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs, books and music to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Books...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buy a link here Sponsored Links Mom Is 55, Looks 30...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her clever $5 wrinkle therapy angers Botox Doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Find Out How!
