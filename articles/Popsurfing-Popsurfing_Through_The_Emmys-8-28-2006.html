                <p>M O N D AY, A U G U S T 2 8 , 2 0 0 6Popsurfing Through The EmmysWell, the show was a fitfully entertaining mess, even if the awards arethe most frustating, puzzling and downright stupid around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conan dida fine job hosting and his Billy Crystal-like opener (where he poppedinto a bunch of different shows) was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His song-and-dancenumber about how much trouble NBC is in was even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thebiggest mistake was forcing presenters to make chit-chat or (evenworse) jokes before announcing the nominees and winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't theyknow you could cut half an hour out of the show and save us all a lot ofmisery by skipping all that? Sure, Stephen Colbert's bit with JonStewart was funny, but that's one out of about 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, when thewinners are announced, the producers are so afraid of dead airtimewhile the people walk to the mike that they try to fill in with randomclips of shows that are invariably confusing and cut off in the middle.Also, who decided what categories should get brief clips and whichcategories would just be named? Some idiot decided SupportingActress in a Miniseries or Movie should feature a clip, which meant wesaw about half of Ellen Burstyn's entire performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presenters werenotably dull, with most of them mumbling out the name of the winner.I don't need high drama, but a slight pause and a note of congratulationin their voice would surely be a lot more appropriate than"andthewinneriselizaebththefirst."The best speech was from the "My Name Is Earl" scribe who namedpeople he DIDN'T want to thank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, the producers seemedrudely focused on cutting off acceptance speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, the director of"Elizabeth I' sounded so comatose he was probably glad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But most ofthe stars, deserved their moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And like the Oscars, they failedcompletely to give you an idea of the performances and shows thatwere being honored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most award presentations didn't feature any clipsand the ones they did show were too short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How about cutting comedyroutines and actually celebrating the shows you're supposed to behonoring?The tribute to Dick Clark was nice, especially since they let him talk.Did we have to hear the three-minute version of "AmericanBandstand's" theme song, however? And the Aaron Spelling tributewas heartfelt if rambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It actually was fun to see the reunion of theNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Popsurﬁng Through The Emmyshttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/08/popsurﬁng-through-e... 1 of 37/28/09 7:48 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SMichael in New YorkBiboyAaron POPSURFING.COM: Popsurﬁng Through The Emmyshttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/08/popsurﬁng-through-e... 2 of 37/28/09 7:48 PMPOPSURFING.COM: Popsurﬁng Through The Emmyshttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/08/popsurﬁng-through-e... 3 of 37/28/09 7:48 PM</p>
