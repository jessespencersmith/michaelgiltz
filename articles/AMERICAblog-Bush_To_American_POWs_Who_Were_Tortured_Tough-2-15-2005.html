                <p>T U E S D A Y , F E B R U A R Y 1 5 , 2 0 0 5Bush To American POWs Who Were Tortured:Toughby Michael in New York on 2/15/2005 11:43:00 AMThis story abounds with so many ironies, I couldn't add themup with a calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the 1991 Gulf War, some Americansoldiers -- pilots whose planes were downed -- were beatenand abused by Iraqis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took place, of course, mainly in AbuGhraib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Congress passed a law in 1996 saying any country thatsponsors terrorism loses its sovereign immunity and can besued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The quaint Geneva Convetion states that no country whosigns on must ever absolve a country of any liability fortorturing POWs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The soldiers banded together, sued SaddamHussein's murderous regime and were awarded nearly $1billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hurrah!But according to the LA Times, Bush is now standing in the wayof those 17 victims of torture to keep them from collecting,saying that the Iraqis are now the good guys and need themoney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, they're already well experienced on doingend-runs around the Geneva Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But really, trying tostop American soldiers who fought bravely for their country andsuffered torture under Saddam Hussein from beingcompensated? Here's the money quote from Bushspokesperson Scott McClellan."No amount of money can truly compensate these brave menand women for the suffering that they went through at thehands of this very brutal regime and at the hands of SaddamHussein," White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan toldreporters when asked about the case in November 2003,according to the LA Times.And now that's exactly what Bush insists they receive:absolutely no money.Maybe they're being prudent and thinking about the future?After all, how much money would the US lose if all thoseinnnocent people we tortured could sue us?
