                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , J U N E 0 8 , 2 0 0 5Downing Street Memo: US Media Starts To AskAbout Smoking Gunby Michael in New York on 6/08/2005 11:19:00 AMThe Bush/Blair conference finally saw the president askedabout the Downing Street Memo.It was the most attention paid by the media in the USA sofar to the "Downing Street memo," first reported on May 1by The Sunday Times of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The memo is said by someof the president's sharpest critics, such as Democratic Rep.John Conyers of Michigan, to be strong evidence that Bushdecided to go to war and then looked for evidence tosupport his decision, wrote USA Today.The defense both offered up was strange to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short,both Bush and Blair said the memo by top British officials saying Bushhad long planned to go to war and was going to find the evidence toback that up no matter what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because it was writtenbefore they went to the UN one last time.Huh? So the memo saying Bush planned to invade Iraq long inadvance of going through the motions of asking the UN to interveneand offering up tainted, flimsy evidence as if it were incontrovertiblewas wrong because it was written before the farcical UN visit? Well,when else can you write down plans to do something in advance?After the fact? Presumably, if the memo had been written after theUN visit, Bush would say it was wrong because it didn't acknowledgeall the (insincere) steps he'd already taken.USA Today has a good breakdown of the memo and why various newsorganizations have taken so long to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The good news? Thestory was kept alive by the blogs and your emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And can anyonefrom the UK weigh in on this argument that "fixed around" (as in theevidence was fixed around Bush's desire to invade Iraq) does nothave the same illicit connotations across the pond as it does here?Maybe someone could email this query to William Safire, thelanguage maven at the NYT at safireonlanguage@nytimes.comRobin Niblett of the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies, a Washington think tank, says it would be easy forAmericans to misunderstand the reference to intelligencebeing "fixed around" Iraq policy. " 'Fixed around' in BritishEnglish means 'bolted on' rather than altered to fit thepolicy," he says to USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add New CommentYou are commenting as a Guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may select one to log into: Daily KosOpen Thread and Diary Rescue - *Today, srkp23(pulling a double shift), ybruti, taylormattd,ItsJessMe and vcmvo2 combed through hundredsof diaries to find this powerful list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today's...4 minutes ago EschatonOvernight - Folk On.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newish.21 minutes ago HuffPost PoliticsMichael Likosky: Ed Rendell: Hardest Working Manin Infrastructure - At this year's National GovernorsAssociation (NGA) meeting, Governor Ed Rendell'stenure as Chair fittingly came to a close with aplenary session on infras...23 minutes ago Crooks and LiarsOpen Thread - Open Thread below...50 minutes ago FiredoglakeLate Night: Livin’ the Dolce Vita with TheLovernator - Who's got time to govern?
