That paints European Muslims as outsiderswhen, for better or worse, they're part of these communities -- ifpoorly assimilated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was born in Bermuda of an American father andCanadian mother, raised in Florida and didn't get US citizenship till Iwas older and wanted to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes me more of an"immigrant" than the London bombers, most of whom were born andraised in the UK.Still, what do you do if a people want to live in your society but don'tembrace the values that society stands for?
