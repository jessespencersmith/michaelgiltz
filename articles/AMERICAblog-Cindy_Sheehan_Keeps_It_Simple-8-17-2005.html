                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , A U G U S T 1 7 , 2 0 0 5Cindy Sheehan Keeps It Simpleby Michael in New York on 8/17/2005 10:22:00 AMCindy Sheehan wisely tries to slow down the increasing hype tokeep the focus where it belongs: on a grieving mother who justwants to talk to the President and get some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shesupports the 900+ vigils taking place around the country, butwants her protest to remain simple and direct."I appreciate all their help, but their help is going to have todiminish and go to the sidelines, so it's going to have to getback to a mom sitting in a chair waiting for George Bush,"she said in an interview Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of those who suggest thather personal tragedy has become a political rallying point,she says, "I kind of see their point that this was agrass-roots thing that grew into a monster....""The media focused more on me and not the message," shesays. "I'm not the only one that wants answers."Part of her reason for saying this? Sheehan is a human being, agrieving mother, and the relentless nasty attacks from the far rightare naturally taking their toll.She admits she also has a more selfish motive for wantingto move out of the spotlight. "Maybe if they focus on themessage, the right-wingers will leave the messenger alonea little bit," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AmoLatino.comAds by Google Add New CommentYou are commenting as a Guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may select one to log into: Logged in as Logout from DISQUSLogged in asusing Facebook Connect (Logout)Type your comment here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daily KosSpecter, Sestak to Visit Netroots Nation - I amthrilled to announce that on Friday, August 14,Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arlen Specter and Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Sestak will bejoining us at Netroots Nation 2009 for aPennsylva...1 minute agoPolitical WireMcCain Lawyers Investigated Obama Citizenship -As we asked earlier this week, if questions overPresident Obama's citizenship were valid, wouldn'tthey have come out during the presidentialcampaign?
