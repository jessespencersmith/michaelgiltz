She pursues the story foryears, chasing down leads, hitting dead ends, winning unlikely allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bitby bit, the unspeakable truths behind a conspiracy that shocked a community into silence begin to surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beneath a Ruthless Sun tells a powerful, page-turning story rooted in the fears that rippled through the South as integration began to take hold, sparking a surge of virulentracism that savaged the vulnerable, debased the powerful, and roils ourown times still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We SayShare This Book About The Author Gilbert King Gilbert King was awarded the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in Nonfiction for The Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the GrovelandBoys, and the Dawn of a New America , which was also a New York Times bestseller and a finalist for the Dayton Literary Peace Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A featured contributor to Smithsonian magazine and The Marshall Project, King alsowrites about justice for The New York Timesand The Washington Post .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: April 24, 2018 Publisher: Riverhead Books Pages: 432 ISBN 10: 0399183388 ISBN 13: 9780399183386Pulitzer Prize winning writer Gilbert King delivers another remarkable true crime story about racial injustice, social inequality, the treatment of the mentally ill and about a dozen other burning, important issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He won the Pulitzer for another true crime book that centered on an early case involving future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.Remarkably, this book is set in the same small Florida town and involves the same infamous sheriff, Willis McCall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact,this town was the scene of not one, not two, but three major cases that made it to the Supreme Court and proved hugelyinfluential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This story begins in December of 1957 when a powerful man is away from home dallying with his mistress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his absence, the man's wife is allegedly raped by a husky black man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needless to say, the KKK-leading sheriff soon has every black man from 8 to 80 rounded up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only question left is who will deliver "justice" first -- the police or a lynch mob.But days later a mentally challenged young white boy who has never hurt a fly is taken into custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This confusedinnocent is labeled the rapist but declared insane and bundled off to a mental asylum, seemingly for the remainder of his days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is never tried or convicted of anything other than being delusional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His delusion? Insisting he had nothing to do with the rape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boy's poor parents do what they can for him and they are abetted by a crusading journalist named MabelNorris Reese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She simply won't rest, despite threats, burning crosses and her weekly newspaper being driven out of business.It's a jaw-dropping story complete with secret confessions, backroom deals, murder, corruption and some twists sounexpected one might be ashamed to include them in a daytime soap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But can I recommend this book? At times, it was so depressing in its catalog of injustice that I had to put it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At other times it was so infuriating, I threw it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And this is no fairy tale with a neat and happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Gilbert King presumably had to wait for some of the principalpeople to die before he could unroll this amazing story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides being a gripping tale of a deeply corrupt small town inwhich a poor white boy may never get justice, "Beneath A Ruthless Sun" hits on numerous topics: the KKK, prisoners used as enslaved labor, the frightening history of lobotomies, the degrading treatment of the mentally ill, the poor not getting a decent defense (it's during the 15 or so year arc of this tragedy that the Supreme Court rules everyone has a right to anattorney) and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King might have ended on some of the genuine good news to be found here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crimes areunearthed, the truth comes out and justice of a sort is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he follows this story to the end and its sobering fall-outleaves you dissatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the tireless journalist Mabel Norris Reese, you feel the prickly sense that more work needs to be done. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “A spellbinding true story of racism, privilege, and official corruption...By turns sobering, frightening, and thrilling, this meticulous account of the power and tenacity of officially sanctioned racism recalls a dark era that America is still struggling to leave behind.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred) “Compelling, insightful and important, Gilbert King exposes the corruption of racial bigotry and animus that shadows a community, a state and a nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fascinating examination of an injustice story all too familiar and still largely ignored, an engaging and essential read.” —Bryan Stevenson, author of Just Mercy "In the tradition of Harper Lee, Gilbert King tells the story of a small southern town corrupted by racism, aperverse genteel honor, and utter disdain for poor “crackers.” Three women stand out in this gripping tale of a falsely accused man: an unrelenting reporter, a mother, and a victim doubly victimized as a pawn of others’ ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In deftly unraveling a tragic mixture of lies, violence, and hatred, King powerfully reminds us how the unpalatable beliefs of 1957 haunt us still." —Nancy Isenberg, author of White Trash “Gilbert King’s stunning chronicle of race, sex and power in fatal combination yields so many truly tragic turns that it’s almost uncanny when goodness endures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With breakneck drama and cold clarity, Beneath a Ruthless Sun captures the sultry particulars of a uniquely charged place and time as well as a universal truth about how difficult it is for humans in the aggregate to do the right thing.” —Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama—the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution Praise for Devil in the Grove : "Must read, cannot put down history." –The New York Times "A taut, intensely readable narrative." –Boston Globe "A powerful and well-told drama of Southern injustice." –The Chicago Tribune What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
