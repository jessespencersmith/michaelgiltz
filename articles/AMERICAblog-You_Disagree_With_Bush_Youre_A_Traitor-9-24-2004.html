                <p>F R I D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 2 4 , 2 0 0 4You Disagree With Bush? Congratulations!You're A Traitor!by Michael in New York on 9/24/2004 02:53:00 AMThe Washington Post does a good rundown of the despicableRepublican smears calling John Kerry a traitor and providing aid andcomfort to the enemy because he dares to question Bush's strategyin Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't need to be told that in America it is every citizen'sright and indeed duty to ask hard questions of our leaders when theytake us to war.But the Democrats need to kick back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are John McCain, Orrin Hatchand Richard Lugar traitors or providing aid and comfort to theenemy? They too have asked hard questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ask Bush if they'retraitors for disagreeing or just suggesting that things aren't goingswimmingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he says no, ask why he doesn't apologize to Kerry andall Americans who disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he tries to say there's a difference, askwhat besides party affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ask Bush if the American citizens whomarched in New York City during the Republican convention aretraitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ask Bush if Canada is a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ask Bush who ISN'T a traitorother than his lackeys.By the way, the otherwise decent article ends with a ridiculous coda."Whatever the merits, the charges that terrorists prefer Democratshave been echoed by independent commentators and journalists.CNN analyst Bill Schneider, asked about Hastert's remarks, agreedthat al Qaeda "would very much like to defeat President Bush."Really? Independent folk all agree that the terrorists would like to seea Democrat elected to the White House? And exactly how was thatpoll conducted? You think the average American is hard to reach dueto caller id -- well, imagine trying to catch Bin Laden on his cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andwhat an absurd statement -- as if there's some consensus amongindependent observers that the terrorists would prefer Kerry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's arather outrageous comment to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've seen numerousindependent folk who've suggested that Bin Laden would prefer tosee Bush reelected -- Bush is Public Enemy Number One in theIslamic world and therefore a great recruiting tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another Presidentwouldn't engender the same hatred, would have a fresh start with ourtraditional allies and might actually be willing to make adjustments toa failed strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why is the Washington Post stating as fact that BinLaden wants Kerry elected?
