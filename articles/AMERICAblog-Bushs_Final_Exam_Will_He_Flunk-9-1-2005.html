                <p>T H U R S D A Y , S E P T E M B E R 0 1 , 2 0 0 5Bush's Final Exam: Will He Flunk?by Michael in New York on 9/01/2005 08:40:00 PMThe New York Times makes clear this is Bush's biggest testsince 9-11, one that in many ways is more complicated. (Nocountries to invade, at least as far as we know.) One veryannoying passage:It is reminiscent of how Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush has argued that progressis being made in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as the administration has learnedin Iraq, the imagery of violent chaos, repeated over andover, can undercut even the most frequently cited statistics.And so Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's biggest risk may be an inability to controlcircumstances that are beyond his ability to shape fromWashington.This is wrong on about eight different levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It implies Bush'sprogress in Iraq is undercut by "the imagery of violent chaos." No,Bush's refusal to FACE FACTS in Iraq is undercut by the daily news ofworsening conditions, increasing deaths, a stronger insurgency andno FACTS to back up Bush's claim that things were peachy.Bush's risk in dealing with Hurrican Katrina is NOT "an inability tocontrol circumstances that are beyond his ability to shape...." No oneis holding Bush accountable for the storm striking land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush isaccountable for what he CAN control -- his indifference and politics-as-usual attitude even AFTER the storm had struck; Bush's refusal tocut his vacation short until the last moment -- and spendingANOTHER night in Crawford rather than going straight to DC while thewaters were rising and people were dying; the slashing of fundsdevoted to shoring up the levees; the reduced level of National Guardavailable; the possible lack of amphibious vehicles because they'vebeen sent to Iraq; the sluggish response; the incompetent lack ofcoordination that MUST come from the federal government and onand on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The facts about all these issues will become clear as soon asthe MSM starts demanding the relevant details.All of these factors are under Bush's control and he can and should beheld accountable for how he performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listing blocks of ice and a fewgenerators on their way won't make people ignore the facts staringthem in the face.This is Bush's final exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, he gets an "F."
