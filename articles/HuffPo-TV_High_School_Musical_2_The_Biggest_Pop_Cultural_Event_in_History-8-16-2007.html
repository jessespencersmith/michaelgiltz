Really? He's an appealing, talented kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's hard to think of anything LESS rockand roll than the Disney Channel TV movie High School Musical and its sequel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the exactopposite of rock and roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People Still Love Pop Music - As much as the industry bemoans slowing music sales, the disappearance of record chains across the country, and the lack of a hot new musical force (like the Seattle scene) to get folks excited, the simple truth is that people still spend billions of dollars ayear on pop music like HSM , the best-selling album of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV is the New Radio - Radio stations are so bland and monomaniacal about playing the same formatted batch of tunes whether you're in Miami, Florida or Minneapolis, Minnesota, that theysimply don't matter any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank God for TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder the music supervisor on Grey's Anatomy got their own record label -- they've done a better job of spotting and promoting talent like Snow Patrol and The Fray than most A&amp;R folk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kids Expect a Multicultural World - Our hero is super-white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His best bud is black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His girlfriend is a sexy mix of Filipino, Chinese, Irish and Native American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the "bad" girl's brother seems to be a coded gay character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But kids don't blink twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They expect their movies and TV to look just like their world, where interracial dating and out teenagers are a banal fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Atomization of our Culture - HSM took so long to gain traction in the Traditional Media because everyone is in a different room in the house, with mom watching Lifetime and dad watching Ice Road Truckers on the History Channel and neither of them having a clue that little Suzie is obsessed with HSM .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With literally something for everyone, can anything bring us together the way, say, I Love Lucy did in the 50s and The Cosby Show did in the 80s? Some Events Can Still Bring Us Together - Don't worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something for everyone doesn't mean everyone can't gather around the water-cooler every once in a while and talk about the sameevent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Idol may score lower ratings than The Cosby Show but it still pulls in a massive audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rowling had people of all ages lined up at midnight to buy a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And HSM2 made enough noise that it won't be just tweens sitting in front of the TV to see HSM2 this weekend: their parents will be there too to check out what all the fuss is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, did I miss any trends encapsulated by High School Musical ?
