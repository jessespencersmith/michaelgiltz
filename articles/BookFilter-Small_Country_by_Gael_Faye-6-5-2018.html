(I just downloaded an EP.) Yet with his sharp eye and gift for detail, I doubt it. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Unforgettable… Gaël Faye’s talent is breathtaking; no country that can give the world a writer like him should be ever be called small. ” – Imbolo Mbue, author of Behold the Dreamers “An evocative portrait of what it means to lose one’s freedom and innocence… He is a writer of great promise and grace. ” – Chigozie Obioma, author of The Fishermen “Personal and intimate… Gaël Faye has evoked the darkest pages of contemporary Africa without tipping into pathos. ” – Alain Mabanckou, author of Broken Glass “The death of innocence seen through the eyes of Gabriel, our beguiling 11-year-old narrator, is at the heart of this gorgeous first novel … Faye eloquently speaks to the untenable choices, among love of country, family, or survival, that victims in conflict zones are forced to make ." -- Library Journal “Gaël Faye is a revelation .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Small Country is a luminous and poignant novel about childhood, war, exile and identity … this is literature at its most powerful .” – Le Parisien Magazine “This beautiful coming-of-age novel expresses a harrowing yearning for kindness and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a vision of the world – not political, but poetic – that attempt s a balancing act between both horror and wonder ." – Le Figaro "In the summer months, there are two categories of books: those we take on holiday and leave behind in the sand, and those that make their mark on us for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Small Country by Gaël Faye is firmly part of the latter category" – Le Matin Dimanche “A literary force to be reckoned with .” – Le Point “Subtle and powerful. ” – Elle "Magnificent ” – Le Parisien What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
