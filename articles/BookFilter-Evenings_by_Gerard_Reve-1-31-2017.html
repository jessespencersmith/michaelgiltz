[a] brilliant modern classic." — Tom Chalmers, Publishers Weekly "The novel is dark, funny, unsettling and lingers vividly in the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hats off to Pushkin Press and the outstanding translator, Sam Garrett, for making this odd, orphaned masterpiece available at last to an English- speaking readership." — Times Literary Supplement "The Evenings is packed with the minutiae of life: luckily, the minutiae are fascinating…Reve isn't the kind of novelist to give you a straightforward… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
