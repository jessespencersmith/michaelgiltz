                <p>by Michael Giltz Imagine what it would be like to see a birthday, l\vist's grandmother gave him the movie for the very first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That sense string puppets his bte grandfather used in of revelation--of an entirely new art his act as a bandleader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later that year, ~n a form bursting trip to New with possibility York, Twist's and enchanr- mom wran- ment-will soon be felt by thousands of people: "Puppet virgins" in the words of pup­ peteer Janie Ceiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 1996 International Festival of Puppet Theatre, presented by the Jim Henson Foundation , is not your father's Howdy Doody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seen here previous­ ly in 1992 and 1994, the Festival now encompasses over 140 perfom1ances by 22 troupes at five theatres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, New York artists will be amply represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a glimpse at three of the Big Apple's best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Basil Twist: Behind The Scene \ Vhen B;1sil '1 \\'ist pert&lt;)J"IllS his 0l1e-II1;111 piece, "The An111eidae Sho\\' ,mel Other Pieces," he's curled up behind his set, hid­ den from the audience's vicw, using CVCI'\"­ thing he cm-his h;lnds, his fL:et, his hips­ to manipulat e puppets, change scenery, move around props and bring ,1 stor~' to life. "If! could wiggle my ears, maybe 1 could it put in some more tricks," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How did he get into this position: Seventeen years ago, Twist got a triple dose of the magic of puppetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For his tenth " The Araneidae Show" photo by.Bobby Miller gled a visit to the headquar­ ters of Muppet mas­ ter Jim Henson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the big event, that same trip, was when his fam­ ily went to see the great French puppeteer Philippe Genty perfonn, albeit to a near empty theatre. "It was very French, very existential," he recalls. "In one piece, he came out with a clown puppet, the typical sad French clown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the puppet looked up ;md saw he was a puppet and was so dis­ o'aught he decided he would break the strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ami he reached up and pulled and broke orf all his strings and collapsed in a hC;IP Oil the 110m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd only scen the .\lupIJets basicall!', so it was nothing like I'd seen before." C:oll1pletek fascill;lted, Twist went back the nnt night 'Inti his fate was sealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, he's studied hard-in Paris and Atbnt;l-and \\'orked anywhere he could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since 1l10ving here four years ago, he's plied his magic on the streets, in nightclubs, Off­ Broadway and with othe: puppeteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, for the 50-rninute- long "The Araneidae (pronounced R-N-A-day) ENCORE f&amp; .1 ~ants to be: Out of the spotlight. "When I was a child I was really shy, and I know that I took up puppetry because I could hide and still impress people," he says, laughing. "And it's still that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't see me at all until I come out for a bow at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I like that kind o(pup­ petry-I like the illusion and the magic when people don't know how you did it." Mabou Mines: Back To Barrie Although inspired Mabou Mines to tackle thp much-loved, much -in te rpreted tale of Peter Pan, their "Peter and Wendy" is designed, much like James Barrie's classic book, to speak to par­ ents, even more so than their offspring . leV/hen we first started thinking of doing it in 1989, our set designer, Julie Archer had just had a baby and m)' son was five," says adapter/producer Lisa Lorwin. "Being a parent, you get to be in your own childhood again, and then you have to lose it all uver again when your child grows up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why the story had a great deal of intensit\, at that moment." To capture that lyric intensity, "Peter ,lI1d \ \'end~ '" combines traditional Japanese hunraku puppetr\I (in which three people operate each char'lcter and a separate per­ son acts as narrator) with shadow puppetry, children's action figures and a score by Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham. ~ SEPTEMBER performances , notably at Spoleto, those expecting Mary Martin or Robin Williams may be a bit surprised. "It was interesting to watch children with parents, because some­ times the parents would begin to look a lit­ tle nervous when they were suddenly aware it wasn't 'Peter Pan,'" she says. "This is adult theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not about big, sweep­ ing, fast-paced adventure." Janie Geiser: Finder of Evidence "People are really quiet when they see it," says Janie Geiser of her award-win­ ning "Evidence of Floods," a noirish tale of a woman fleeing her abusive hus­ and. "They almost feel like they have to walk quietly," Unlike traditional staged works, "Evidence of Floods" consists of eight different sets scat­ tered around a darkened room-this one at Dance Theater Workshop-with pools of blue lights as the only illuminati on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Audiences file from set to set, where the individual puppeteers perform their scene over and over again, as a taped score plays in the background. "It becomes this kind of Zen thing and something new happens every time," she says, ~With puppets, as well as people, you can't predict every move they make." With its serious subject maner and sub­ tle allusions (the cop chasing the woman whistles that infamou:;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Mitchum tune from "The Night of the HWlter"), "Evidence" is certainly a far cry from "Sesame Street." That makes it doubly wonderful, she says, that the Henson Foundation is presenting it. "A new 'ludiellce fur puppetry is grow­ ing because of this festival," she says. "It's brought visibility to the form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I tell them, 'It's really worked.'" i.- " Punch" photo by Richard Termine .9.p.s.</p>
