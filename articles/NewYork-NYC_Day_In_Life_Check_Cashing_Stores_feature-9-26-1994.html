"You can pick it up at any check-cashing store they desig­ nate," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is there a fee? "No, there's no fee because it's a government check." Does he Jive on the Upper West Side? "You could say I live in this area," he answers politely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One young black woman standing in line says simply, "[ don't like banks." She moves past the support pillar decorated with Lollo ads, declining to give her name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along the wall are notices in English and Spanish about Western Union, along with a chart detail­ ing the fees for cashing checks, and re­ minders that bills for Con Edison and NYNEX can be paid there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woodie Cren­ shaw, who lives in the West Eighties, comes here all the time, preferring to pay her phone and electric bills in cash. "I like to know the bills are paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I pay it and I know it's done." Later, a well-dressed woman with reddish hair who is wearing her sunglasses indoors is arguing/plead­ ing at one of the windows. "This is from the largest Jewish foundation in New York," she says about her check. "Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listen, I'm desperate; I don't even have enough money for wherc I'm going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have no way to get money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The young guy cash.ed one last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation 's ill the phone book." Fin&lt;llly, she gets wh&lt;lt she wants. "Thanks, you're a doll," she says. "Thank you, honey." New York City has 416 licensed check-cashing stores, but some people, like Jesus Abreu, use them only under unusu&lt;ll circumstances. (Abreu has liter­ &lt;Illy jus/ moved here after accepting an internship at McCall's, and he doesn't have a bank account yeLl "I've just moved up from Miami," he explains &lt;It one of the service windows , "and I'm living in New York and I was wondering Photographs: top, James McGoon; bollom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ted Hardin: tup right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Omlici Shure; bullum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yamashita. if you could cash my ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; H' . . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IS VOice trads off as the woman studies his check; a few minutes later, he leaves empty-handed.</p>
