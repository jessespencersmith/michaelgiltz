But even passing tunes are winners: "Sister Suffragette" is awinner and for a primer on how the money you deposit in a bank is put to work, you simply can'tdo better than "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank." ( Go here to see Dick Van Dyke deliver it winningly. ) Very few musicals created directly for the screen can match this gem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So which Julie Andrews movie is your favorite? Mary Poppins? The Sound Of Music? I'd take Victor/Victoria myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DOCUMENTARY OF THE YEAR -- Full disclosure: I actually know the director of Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(That's the worst thing aboutpeople you know who write books or plays or record albums or make movies or star in a show --you have to talk to them about it and God help you if you have to struggle to say something nice.It's a nightmare.) The film was not a career overview but focused on the sensational scandal thatturned Polanski into an exile unable to return to America: he was accused of unlawful sexualintercourse with a young girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought I knew the story: somehow, I'd received the impressionthat it was statutory rape but that the minor was "willing" (though legally, one can't be).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moviespoke to most everyone involved who was still alive and painted a far bleaker picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Polanski, tome, came across far less sympathetically even though the film treated him fairly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was apredatory fellow who invariably seduced young women and girls throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The girl hadlong since forgiven him and moved on but never pretends in this, her first interview since thecrime, that it was all fun and games. (You can't help condemning her mother as much as Polanski.)But the scandal wasn't just Polanski's actions but the absurd behavior of the presiding judge,which turned a crime for which Polanski should have long since paid his dues into a decades-longtravesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, Zenovich details a fascinating bit of Hollywood history so thoroughly and digs upenough new information that the film made headlines, reopened the case (which has a new courtdate as both the California courts and Polanski jockey on the terms) and both lays out the factsagainst the director AND the court system that failed the young girl miserably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's gripping, funnyand a model of fairness that doesn't confuse that standard with some sort of artificial balance.Bizarrely, some reviewers thought Zenovich was attempting to downplay Polanski's actions butdetailing the insane behavior of the legal system doesn't change the facts of what he did one iota.And no one has told that story better than she does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So imagine my reaction to seeing the film: Iwent from relief over the fact that it didn't suck (thank God I'd be able to say something nice) to agrowing realization that it was REALLY good to a wonderful tinge of jealousy over how good itreally was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, the Oscars continued their bizarre pattern of ignoring top-flightdocumentaries (a track record that has improved slightly in the last few years) and ignored thisfilm along with the animated Waltz With Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That just puts it in the company of other great documentaries, right where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BLACK HISTORY MONTH -- With Barack Obama as President, the idea of focusing on African American issues just for one month a year seems more absurd than ever. (Obama's presidency doesn't mean we'll talk and think and deal with race less, it means we'll deal with it MORE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or so one hopes.) But if it serves as a spur for studios to release films that might otherwise not appear, well fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've always been a tad dismissive of Sidney Poitier, who always seemed more of a symbol than a man in his films (especially something like Guess Who's Coming To Dinner? ) What did I care about the burden he shouldered of representing a race on film? He bored me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the truth is that I haven't seen a lot of his best work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sidney Poitier Collection ($39.98; Warner Bros.) begins to rectify that, with four movies (three of which are good to great).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get Something Of Value, a curio I'd never heard of about Kenya co-starring Rock Hudson of all people; A Patch Of Blue which deals with race and blindness but is most memorable for Shelley Winters in one of her patented hateful character studies (was anyone more willing to be really dislikedonscreen?); the actually forgettable A Warm December (an early Poitier directorial effort) and best of all Martin Ritt's film debut Edge of the City with Poitier befriending John Cassavetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out: the fascinating documentary Listen Up: The Lives Of Quincy Jones ($24.98; Warner Bros.) whichjust scratches the surface of his brilliant career in popular music; A Hero Aint' Nothin' But ASandwich ($14.98; Koch), the Afterschool Special-ish feature about drugs starring Cicely Tyson; Tupac Assassination Part I and Part II ($14.98; Mill Creek) which delves into the death of TupacShakur and offers new interviews, audio of Shakur himself and more; A Good Day To Be Black &amp;Sexy ($26.98; Magnolia), an Altman-esque look at the lives of several couples in LA; and best of all Black Is...Black Ain't ($19.95; Docurama), the final probing look at black culture before director Marlon Riggs died of AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WAS NATALIE WOOD A STAR? -- Of course, but did she WANT to be a star? A handful of great films -- Rebel Without A Cause, West Side Story and Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice -- ensure she'll always be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two good films are included in the boxed set The Natalie Wood Collection ($59.98; Warner Bros.), namely Splendor In The Grass and Gypsy .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They fit nicely alongside four other middling films like Inside Daisy Clover and Cash McCall , which are fine but not great and in which Wood is fine and not great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her final movie Brainstorm ($19.98; Warner Style On CBS' "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

"I Love The 80's" works perfectly, despite bad punctuation (it should be '80s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as the '70s (see?) had a distinctive vibe, a number of hit films from the ''80s had a glossy, poppy glow about them that somehow makes linking everything from the umpteenth comedy from Cheech &amp; Chong to the goofy Flashdance perfectly reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Beals is so talented and beautiful that she somehow overcome the absurd hit Flashdance ($14.98; Paramount) though why we didn't howl it out of the theaters I'll never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheech &amp; Chong's Still Smokin' ($14.98; Paramount) was a weezy gasp for the duo but Top Secret! ($14.98; Paramount) proved Airplane! was no fluke and made Val Kilmer a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Naked Gun ($14.98; Paramount) rescued a great TV series with a decent movie spin-off and while I loved the '80s, I must admit I've never seen Eddie Murphy's Coming To America ($14.98; Paramount), so now I've got no excuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fairly disparate bunch of flicks, but they all belong together somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so with the Martini Movies series fromSony.These five movies from the '50s, '70s and '80s are from different decades and genres andpriced a tad too high and NONE of them belong in a series called Martini Movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mostintriguing of the bunch is 5ive ($19.94; Sony), a post-nuclear holocaust sci-fi film of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's Vibes, with Jeff Goldblum and Cyndi Lauper as psychics looking for buried treasure; ElliottGould torn between the Establishment and campus radicals in Getting Straight, the modest spy spoof Our Man In Havana with Alec Guinness and Gumshoe , an even more modest detective satire with Albert Finney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of them are $19.94 each from Sony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The covers are murky andunattractive and the tag of Martini Movies makes absolutely no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why not call them Oddballsand Eccentrics? Or why not ignore some forced theme and just release them even more cheaply ata budget price? WAS IT THE HOCKEY MASK? -- I can't quite figure out why the Friday The 13th franchise has proven so enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason isn't a particularly interesting villain and the original Friday The 13th Uncut ($16.99 regular and $29.99 on BluRay; Paramount) doesn't offer anything that would indicate hit potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halloween was genuinely scary and had a great score; Nightmare on Elm Street had humor, Saw had a vicious nasty tone and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Friday The 13th? Those fascinated can watch His Name Was Jason ($19.97; Anchor Bay), a two DVD set exploring every facet of the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the first three films are back out in new editions ($16.99 each; Paramount) with trulysensational-looking covers that boast a very cool 3-D effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what was it about Friday The 13ththat made the movies endure? It might be something as simple as the title: everyone knows Fridaythe 13th means bad luck so they immediately understood what the first film would be and itprovided perfect marketing for the sequels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes it's just as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BARBRA TAKES CHARGE -- Streisand had a triumphant film directorial debut with the unlikely Yentl ($29.99; MGM), the modest Isaac Bashevis Singer short story turned into a musical starring Streisand as a girl who dresses as a boy so she can go to yeshiva and study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A perfectionist,it's no surprise to see Streisand has delivered a new cut about three minutes longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But happily shealso includes the original theatrical version, as well as an audio commentary and a second discloaded with extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being in charge suits her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out: The over-stuffed star-studded vehicle TheYellow Rolls-Royce ($19.97; Warner Bros.); the woebegone Peter O'Toole-starring Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chips ($19.97; Warner Bros.), a story which most definitely did NOT cry out for a musical version; Nick Nolte and Debra Winger in Cannery Row ($19.97; Warner Bros.); Vivian Leigh in the role audiences demanded after seeing her as Scarlet O'Hara: a prostitute in Waterloo Bridge ($19.97; Warner Bros.) and Julie Christie just luminous in the Thomas Hardy tale Far From The Madding Crowd ($19.97; Warner Bros.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OBAMA ON DVD IN RECORD TIME -- CBS is rush-delivering a four hour DVD covering the rise of Barack Obama pegged to his appearance on 60 Minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama: All Access ($19.99; Paramount) (which makes him sound like a rock concert) includes not just all the interviews he's given 60 Minutes over the last few years but also key public moments like Obama's announcement Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Cars War Wire Video Financial Crisis Barack Obama MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

No, it just wasn't quite interesting enough, strange to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great title, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Invaders Second Season ($36.98; Paramount) -- the second and final season of this 60s curio, a combination of The X-Files and The Fugitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Closing The Ring ($19.98; Genius) -- Sir Richard Attenborough is a nice man and played a great Santa but simply isn't a very nimble director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Shirley MacLaine, Christopher Plummer , Brenda Fricker and others do what they can with this stodgy, old-fashioned romance set during and afterWorld War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FINALLY, A BLU-RAY ROUND-UP BluRay titles keep pouring out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One fact is clear: movie studios are NOT lowering the price of BluRay fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this economy, they better make BluRay the same price of even CHEAPERthan their regular DVD releases if they want to get people excited about buying a new DVD playerand discovering the jump in quality BluRay provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if they don't act soon, BluRay will simplyfade away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one NEEDS BluRay discs because regular DVDs are great (unlike the awful VHStapes they replaced).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, if you have an HD-ready plasma or LCD TV and a sound system,you certainly should buy a BluRay player because it will make your library of regular DVDs lookbetter and you can always rent BluRay titles or just buy the ones that are actually a bargain or toogood to pass up (like The Godfather. ) For all the titles below, you can just assume they look substantially better than their regular DVD counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm just trying to keep you up-to-date onwhat's being released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being There ($28.99; Warner Bros.) -- a pitch-perfect swan song for Peter Sellers (yes, I'mMichael Giltz: DVDs -- Practically Perfect Mary Poppins http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----practically-perfe_b_164793.html [4/5/2009 12:27:41 PM] Michelle Obama's Clothing Has Sean Hannity All Out OfSorts Richard Poplawski, Gunman'Lying In Wait,' Kills 3Pittsburgh Police Officers Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rachel Ehrenfeld: DoesIran Harbor Osama binLaden?
