Sadly, the man who made his living with his fists was brutally at- tacked after coming out of a gay bar in the early 1990s in what police termed a hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He spent a month in the hospital and still suffers from short-term memo- ry loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filmmaker Klores better understood the culture that shaped the champ after visiting the Virgin Islands and experi- encing its bigotry toward even its most famous son. "Wherever you go there is stuff named after him," says Klores. "Grif- fith Park, Griffith Stadium, Griffith G;.'rn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when I started speaking to people, I was stunned. 'Oh, yeah, the faggot?' That's what they say. 'Oh, he was a fag."' I= â‚¬ =The new documentary Bing of Fire tells the story of a boxer who beat a man t0 death over one word:"faggot" By Michael Giltz n March of 1962 reigning boxing champ Emile Griffrth was set for a rematch with Benny "the Kid" Paret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the weigh-in, Paret taunted Griffith with one word, voicing what was an open secret in the boxing world: " Maricon," said Parel, in front of all the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new documentary Ri,ng of Fi,re: The Emile GrnfJi,th Story (airing on USA Network April 20) details whathappened next: During the actual match, millions watching TV at home saw Griffith literally pummel Paret to death. (He was taken to the hospital and died 10 days later.) Codirected by Dan Klores and Ron Berger, the film shows the world Grif- fith came from and details the reper- cussions in the sport (which didn't re- turn to television for about a decade) and in the lives of Griffith's and THE A0V0CATE | 60 | lpnrL 26,2005</p>
