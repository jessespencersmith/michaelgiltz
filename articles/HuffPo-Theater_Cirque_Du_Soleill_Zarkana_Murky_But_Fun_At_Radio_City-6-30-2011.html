Othertimes, it seems like Cirque has come to town and you'veseen it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that's what the circus is like too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Ringling Bros. comes to town, you'd don't expect someradical new experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You expect clowns and trapeze artists and animal acts and cotton candy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, they usually give each edition a special name and hype some particular act, but it's the circus and you know what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true for Cirque, especially after so many years of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their latest spectacle is Zarkana , designed specifically for the grand space of Radio City Music Hall .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go into it expecting some fresh new experience and you'll be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go expecting to see some world-class acts with Cirque'susual Euro-pop trappings and you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; September 15, 2011 EDITION: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like 43 Posted: 6/30/11 03:38 PM ET SHARE THIS STORY Submit this story Get Arts Alerts Sign Up PHOTO GALLERIESCONNECT FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT TECH MEDIA LIFE &amp; STYLE CULTURE COMEDY HEALTHY LIVING WOMEN LOCAL MORE Like 9KArchitecture Design Film BlackBerry 101 More Log inThis particular show -- Zarkana -- really is a load of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ringleader Zark stands around singing generic pop songs about his lost girlfriend (and his lost magical powers) and by the end of the show they reunite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually, Cirque's songs are performed in a nonsense language; this time they chose to useEnglish lyrics, unfortunately, so you have to hear all sorts of blather in between the acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fortunately, those acts come tumbling one after the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cirque makes good use of Radio City for some grand visuals (like snakes crawling up the side of the proscenium; a spider's web and performers seemingto dangle in the air way, way in the distance until you realize it's video projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved how they usedthe video screens to get the thousands of people focused on intimate acts like the wonderful sand artist that opened act two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act one began modestly with a juggler who actually had quite a few bobbles; this was in fact a nice reminder that these stunts don't come automatically and unintentionally created anedge of suspense for the more daring feats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since even a juggler can mess up, how much more dangerousis it when two men are jumping and whirling in the air both inside and outside metal cages that spinover and under each other high above the stage? Even more suspense of an unintended sort was created when a man who we later discovered was an expert in hand balancing came out on stage, felt the moment wasn't right for whatever reason, and simply walked off again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The platform he abandoned stayed in the middle of the set for a few minutes while the music continued and other performers stood around expectantly until the show finally moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Myguest said, "I'm totally confused" and laughed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was another rare moment of quirkiness and the humanelement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far more often, acrobats whirled across the stage without missing a beat; men tossed flag-sticks high in the air and across the stage to fellow performers, all of it in beautiful synchronicity; and artists formedhuman pyramids or swung each other through the air high above the stage and it all came off perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tone might be a smidgen darker than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the clowns are always on hand ready to dispel any air of gloom after a six-limbed baby in an aquarium rolls across the stage or snakes and spiders havedominated the action for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, you've seen it all before, at least when it comes to thespecialty acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're still daring and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cirque can't reinvent the wheel any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sometimesas with Zarkana they shouldn't try so hard to make it appear as if they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Theater Season 2011-2012 (on a four star scale) Broadway By The Year: 1997 ** 1/2 out of **** One Arm *** Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark * 1/2 Unnatural Acts *** Zarkana ** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 'Web Cam 101 For Seniors' Turns Oregon Oldsters Into YouTube Celebrities Scarlett Johansson Nude Photos Prompt Investigation SHOCK VIDEO: Debate Audience Says Uninsured Patient Should Be Left To Die Celestrellas: Angola named Miss Universe 2011 - show recap (PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS) AOL TV: Jon Cryer, Ashton Kutcher &amp; Angus T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jones Talk 'Two and a Half Men' Season 9 (VIDEO) Ten Signs Your Marriage is Headed for Divorce Mark Blankenship True Blood Sucker Punch: Season 4, Ep. 12 Engadget: Windows 8 for tablets hands-on preview (video) AOL Jobs: Spelling Errors Send Red Flags To Employers DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5FOLLOW USKnockoffs As Fine ArtNew York Fire Department Collaborates On On the Waterfront Ballets Russes Updated: Aspen Santa Fe Ballet...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like 112K Like 80 Like 64K Like 2K Like 453 Like 2K Like 111 Like 3K Like 1KJames Franco Buys Portrait of Himself From...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phallic Sculpture In Dunedin, New Zealand Causes...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twin Artists Create '3D Drawing Machine' (VIDEO) British Pop Artist Richard Hamilton Dies At...available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Note : Michael Giltz was provided with free tickets to this show with the understanding that he would be writing a review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz Buy a link here Sponsored Links 57 Year Old Mom Looks 27 Huffington Post Readers: Mom Reveals $5 Wrinkle Trick Angering Doctors Daily-Lifestyles.com Get the Visa Black Card Enjoy an Exclusive Rewards Program. 1% Cash Back or Travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apply Now! www.blackcard.com Truth About Scientology You've Heard The Controversy, Now Get The Facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watch Online Videos Scientology.org Penny Stock Jumping 3000% Join our 100% Free Newsletter &amp; get Penny Stock Picks that jump high! www.AwesomePennyStocks.com More in Arts...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kumi Naidoo Donâ€™t Make a Wave: Greenpeace at 40 Candy Spelling iPads and Social Media in the Classroom?
