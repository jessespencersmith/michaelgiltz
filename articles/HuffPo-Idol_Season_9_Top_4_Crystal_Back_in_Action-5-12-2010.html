Lee Dewyze should thank his lucky stars he got to duet with Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It put him in the best light in weeksand gives him a leg up on joining her in the finale in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie Foxx was the guest mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He focused mainly on getting up in the contestant's faces, forcing them to sing right to him as he stood inches away from their face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While he got across just one basic idea, it didseem to loosen them up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foxx also cleverly allowed himself a vote alongside the judges by bringing t- shirts that read "Contestant" and "Artist" and choosing who deserved what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEE DEWYZE -- Sang the Seal tune "Kiss From A Rose" from Batman Forever, the best song from the franchise, which appeared in the worst film of them all, by far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee was fine but not commanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How far can a raspy voice take him? Kara oddly said "Kiss From A Rose" is one of the the hardest songs tosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may not be the easiest but surely it's far from the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL LYNCHE -- Sang Michael Jackson's "Will You Be There" from Free Willy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy chided him for not choosing an r&amp;b song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? It has gospel overtones, but it's definitely r&amp;b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael was a tad better than Lee in a performance that was filled with runs and riffs and other vocalizing acrobatics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Celebrity Skin | Jersey Shore | Ellen Degeneres | Celebrity Body | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP SHARE THIS STORY Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments 6 More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

(I've heard the original artists stumble over it once or twice.) But Lee andCrystal strapped on guitars, faced each other, and did it very very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They blended perfectly, withCrystal coming off light and sweet (as opposed to her usually bluesy mama) and Lee proving much better at connecting one on one than to an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASEY JAMES -- Sang Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robinson" from The Graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seemed like a desperate choice and practically begged the judges to waste time joshing with Kara -- which they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actual performance was pretty good, with Casey on mandolin, though his vibrato is still as wide as Texas.He just doesn't look confident whenever he's not performing and often doesn't look confident even whenhe is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus the song and the arrangement are way out of his Stevie Ray Vaughan wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why stray at this stage? He should have rocked out, especially since his other tune was a ballad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bad choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRYSTAL BOWERSOX -- Sang "I'm Alright" from Caddyshack .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tune was more defiant in her hands and certainly bluesier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Ellen said, she actually made the song better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her on guitar with just the percussionist (and the backup singers upstairs) kept the focus visually on her, which was smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A light pop song suddenly sounded personal and meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not out of the ballpark but quite strong and far better than the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL LYNCHE AND CASEY JAMES -- Sang "Have You Ever Loved A Woman" from Don Juan DeMarco, a Bryan Adams tune I have a particular weakness for. (Hey, it's a great melody.) They're fighting for third place and I'd say it was basically a draw, with Michael evincing a tad more personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges went over the top with their praise, though it certainly was better than their solo slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, it did give Ellen the line of the night when she responded to the musical question "Have you ever loved a woman?" with a friendly "yep." Yes, it's a new world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael and Casey will be in the bottom two with Casey going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So who do you think is going home? And do you agree Crystal is flying to the finish?
