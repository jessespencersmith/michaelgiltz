                <p>Saturday, September 7, 2019 ﬂNON-FICTION We’re Gonna Need a Bigger Boat In ‘The Outlaw Ocean,’ a Reporter Tracks Down Malfeasance on the High Seas  August 28, 2019 Michael Giltz Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ian Urbina rightly made waves (sue me) with a series of investigative pieces about the “outlaw ocean.” Writing for the New York Times in 2015, Urbina brought to attention lawlessness on the high seas that made “Deadwood” sound like a family-friendly vacation spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urbina has shaped those wide-ranging articles into his latest book, appropriately named The Outlaw Ocean .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leonardo DiCaprio has already optioned it as a potential film project.And no wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stories collected here range all over the globe and include misery, piracy, murder, enslavement and the constant threat of death–a reality for anyone on a boat on the high seas, whether or notsomeone else is trying to ram into your ship or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urbina begins in the Antarctic, where the Sea Shepherd organization is tracking down ships named by Interpol as the worst violators of fishing laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We quickly learn that “laws” of any sort in international waters are both half-assed (at best) and–for a thousand different reasons–virtually never enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn’t stop SeaShepherd from attempting a citizen’s arrest of one notorious bad actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urbina is just getting going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He then heads to Palau, a tiny country with just one patrol boat guarding an area the size of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Palau is attempting to protect both its tourism industry and its rights by going after thenumerous poachers that invade its waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And on he goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urbina takes a side trip to check out the quixotic country of Sealand, also known as an abandoned anti-aircraft platform “seized” by an eccentric Brit named Paddy Roy Bates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At first, it was the home of a pirate radio station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Bates declared Sealand an independent country, one that issues passports and stillexists to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That’s it for fun and games, with Urbina taking off again to examine the virtual enslavement of men enticed into working on a fishing vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no, slavery is not too harsh a term for people literally trapped on vessels forIan Urbina. ← Lost In Translation Where’s The Wrestling? →years at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rogue ship that provides abortions to women in international waters, mercenaries who help others “reclaim” ships when people dispute their ownership, corrupt ports, hired guns that provide Blackwater- style protection for container ships under constant threat of piracy– the tales are truly endless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like a good storyteller, Urbina circles back to Antarctica at the end, givingthese disparate stories an overriding arc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, he watches Sea Shepherdplay a dangerous game of tag with Japanese harpoon ships hunting downminke whales. (They claim to be doing scientific surveys.) Urbina’s writing is informed, engaging and self-deprecating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often risking his life, he’s painfully aware he’s choosing to place himself in thesepositions while many of the people he is reporting on have no say in thematter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each chapter is involving in its own right, much as I rememberthem being when these stories first appeared over a series of months in theNew York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet The Outlaw Ocean simply doesn’t work as a book read in one fell swoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, I started to break up the chapters with other reading when Irealized a concentrated burst of attention was doing it no favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The simple truth is that many of these stories end up describing people in one boat trying to chase down people inanother boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read months apart, the stories stand on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read all at once, they become repetitious,despite Urbina changing the focus again and again to cover an impressively wide range of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s an important topic, Urbina covers it well and you’ll rightly feel guilty for eating any seafood you didn’t catch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for real drama and a satisfying work of art, we may have to wait for DiCaprio’s film.
