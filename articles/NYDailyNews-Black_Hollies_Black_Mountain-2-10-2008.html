                <p>New bands look back to the psychedelic era BY MICHAEL GII';ITZ' rooves are groovy'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the vibe of the bands that are mining the soul of the psychedelic era for inspiratioh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jersey City denizeirs the Black Hollies are cel- ebrating their upcoming second CD, "Casting Shadows," with three shows in three days in the New York area, starting with Magnetic Field in Brooklyn on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll hear sitars and fuzzy-bass on truly psy- chedelic numbers like "Paislev Pattern Ground." Thev joiri groups like Midlake, the boral, Sharon Jones a.td th" Dap Kings and counfless others who revel in the classic sounds of classic rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vancouver collective Black Mountain - with their ac- claimed second album, "In the Rrture" - stomp through the '70s at the Bowery Ballroom on Feb.22, complete with a l7-minute epic called."Bright Lights." And the Welsh band Super Firrry Animals, which plays the Bowery Ballroom Feb. 25 in support of the new CD "Hey Venus!," are sure to offer their usual trippy lighG and-slide show to complement their tunes. 'A lot of newer bands feel like they have to make a point by sounding different," says Matt Camirind, the bassist in Back Mountain (and, in the current vogue for multitasking, the bassist in Blood Meridian as well). "I malte music that I like listening to and yeah, we like a lot of older music - country, blues and classic rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Music is like a rock'n' roll fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You grew up worship- ing music and the people who made it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to feel the way it feels to make that music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're not trying to break ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're just tryingto have fun." Name-checking bands from 40 years ago makes sense for a group like the Black Hollies, since that's the music they've always listened to and loved. "I ltold my mom responsible," says Black Hollies lead singerJustinAngelo Morey. "She always had great soul records and the Beafles and the Yardbirds." Morey also soaked up classic tunes via the radio. "As a child growing up in Jersey City, you had to like rap," says the 3l-year-old. "But I'd listen to the Rhythm Revue [radio show] every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. onJazz.89.It became routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd be in bed, hanging out, having brealdast, looking through books and having it on in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then latel I'd be in a car and go to thrift stores, like the Salvafion Army on Martin Luther King in Jersey City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'd find really amazing '60s gear be- cause nobody was picking it up and Edwin Starr records for a dollar."Black Mountain has picked up increasing press at- tention in the U.K. and "In the Future" will clearly dom- inate Camirind's life for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like so many groups, it's a shifting collective, with everyone seemingly involved intwo orthree otherbands. "It's perfect because I can tourwith these guys until we're thoroughly sick of each other and then I can switch to Blood Meridian," jokes Camirind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Camirind (who is a health-care worker when not touring), Morey has a day job, at the Al Richards Homemade Chocolates company.But he doesn't do ev- eryttring old school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Black Hollies will have a song featured in the new Dell computer TV ads, following quickly on an bnline Nike campaign with Lance Arm- strong and another song being highlighted on the Denis Leary drama "Rescue Me." True to forrn, however, Morey doesn't have a DVR and never saw it. "Unfortunately, I was working the night it came on and missed it," says Morey. "I have a black-and-white Tvwitfi the rabbit ears and a dial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't even have an iPod." o The Black Hollies play Magnetic Field in Brooklyn on Friday. 97 Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn: (718) 834-0069.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black Mountain is at Bowery Ballroom, Feb.22.6 Delancey st., (212) s33-2111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Super Furry Animals are at Bowery Ballroom, Feb. 25.u J J o q U o ^ z U -o</p>
