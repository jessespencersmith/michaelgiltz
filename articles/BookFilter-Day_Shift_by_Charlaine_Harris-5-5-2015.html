Many classic works of fiction were serialized in magazines,Charles Dickens being the best example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And naturally some epic works need to be told over multiple volumes buttell essentially one long story: think Proust's masterpiece "In Search Of Lost Time," or Tolkien's "The Lord Of TheRings." And fiction has always featured on-going series, especially in mystery and sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now I think TV is provinga bigger influence on fiction and what writers set out to do in one of their worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Used to be, a mystery might launcha detective with a satisfying, self-contained puzzler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it worked, the hero would return and the world would deepenwith each new mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Charlaine Harris and others are doing something slightly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her new series is setin "Midnight, Texas," an isolated town with denizens who all are hiding secrets, like the vampire, the hotline psychicwho really is a psychic and the witch that has more potential than she realizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some fans complained the first bookwas a little slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now having read "Day Shift," the second book in the series, I realize that first book wasn't anovel: it was a pilot, just like on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It introduced the characters, told a story and set up some puzzles we realizedwouldn't be explained until later in the season...I mean series! Book Two is more contained, but it too feels like thelatest episode of a TV series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't mean Harris is looking at the success of "True Blood," which to me never quitecaptured the loopy humor of her Sookie Stackhouse tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I simply mean that she realizes fans are with her for thelong haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't need one long tale and they don't need neat, self-contained tales that provide a modest bit ofbackground or insight into our hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're willing to take the long view while Harris does something that's not quitea series of adventures and not quite one long story and not quite self-contained mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the Latin market didn'talready give this a particular soap opera spin and that idea of one complete story told over many episodes, youmight call it a telenovela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of the first book will be satisfied as we enjoy seeing the townsfolk of Midnightreluctantly come together to fight a common foe and keep their much-needed privacy from the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's low-key,character-driven and quieter than Harris' most famous work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm intrigued and hope it gets renewed for at leastfour or five seasons. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for Midnight Crossroad“Excellent…No matter how unlikely or fantastic an element she might introduce into her pages, it’s always down-home and believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She’s the Mark Twain of things that live under your bed.”—Houston Press“An excellent follow-up to True Detective…If you aren’t quite ready to let go of the eerie South yet, pick up your copyof Midnight Crossroad.”—The Novelettes“A little magic, a little mystery, and a lot of imagination make for a story that is both fun and edgy.”—Kirkus ReviewsWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
