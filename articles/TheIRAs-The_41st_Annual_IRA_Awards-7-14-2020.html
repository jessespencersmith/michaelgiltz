                <p>Newer Post Older PostSUNDAY, MARCH 13, 2016 The 41st Annual IRA Film Awards -- "Tangerine," "The Tribe" Triumph The 41st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2015 The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the best films of the year since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officially known as the New York Independent Film Critics Awards but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs, it is more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes, the IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies released in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story lost in the mist of time.) The IRAs has been profiled in The New Yorker so it is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of it .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best- selling and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics, screenwriters, budding playwrights, plain old film buffs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year the IRAs have added Best Nonfiction Film to its list of awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are passionate film lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many have careers involving the arts but it's not always easy to stay in the swim of things and keep on top of the flood of new releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) on some streaming service or DVD if you miss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life, before jobs and family made claims on their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you want to stay on top of great cinema every year or explore its history, there's no better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the year than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they've been doing it for decades so, hey, it's tradition! And the IRA goes to....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PICTURE 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tangerine -- 22 pts. (out of a possible 45 pts.) 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mommy -- 13 pts. 3. (tie) Mad Max: Fury Road -- 12 pts. (tie) The Tribe 12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clouds Of Sils Maria 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: When there's a tie, the number of films tied fill up a corresponding number of slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, two films tied for #3, so that fills up both #3 and #4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus the next film listed is ranked at #5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year nine ballots were submitted with a top score for each film of 5 pts, so the maximum any one film could achieve was 45 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs are voted on from Best Costumes up to Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So this award comes towards the end of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The victory of Tangerine is no surprise, really: it won or tied for six of the Top 12 awards. (There are also "negative" awards.) Clearly it's support was deep and strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, when The Tribe won the penultimate prize of Best Director by a substantial margin, it was reasonable to expect it would win Best Picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRA members are no vehement auteurists, but they certainly recognize directors as usually the driving force of most films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Much of the time, Best Picture and Best Director go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That gets muddier when the race is tight, as you can see in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What makes this year rather unusual is that Tangerine enjoyed a substantial victory for Best Picture and The Tribe enjoyed a substantial victory for Best Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It just proves that IRA voting is informed and smart but ultimately driven by passion and admiration, not by any hidebound rules or academic theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result? Five films enjoyed five of the top six awards for the night: The Diary Of A Teenage Girl, The End Of The Tour, Mommy, Tangerine and The Tribe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST DIRECTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miroslav Slaboshpytski for The Tribe -- 24 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Baker for Tangerine -- 16 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xavier Dolan for Mommy -- 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Miller for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todd Haynes for Carol -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Coming out of nowhere, The Tribe wins Best Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, while it wasn't a threat to win in earlier categories, The Tribe did garner mentions in three earlier rounds of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, the film's best shot at an acting award probably came in supporting actress, one of the most crowded awards in memory, with a wealth of good performances to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The male characters in the film are unnamed and tend to blur together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a criticism of the film -- that's how it was crafted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that does make it harder to single people out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this Ukrainian film is one of the boldest movies in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's set in a school for the deaf and the entire film is performed in Ukrainian Sign Language, with no dialogue, no subtitles and no voice- over or even any explanatory text providing context for the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet, anyone can follow the complex storyline and shifting loyalties of the characters with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's remarkably absorbing and feels genuinely fresh and new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't happen every day and this award is a statement from the IRAs that we'll be hearing from this director again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Segel for The End Of The Tour -- 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Dano for Love And Mercy -- 17 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Antoine-Olivier Pilon for Mommy -- 16 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben Mendelsohn for Mississippi Grind -- 13 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Géza Röhrig for Son Of Saul -- 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Jason Segel's turn as David Foster Wallace inspired passionate support from voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Jesse Eisenberg's turn as the reporter in that film received "Mechanical Actor" points in the final negative awards of the night, which helps explain why The End Of The Tour could win Best Actor and Best Screenplay but not really be a player in many other categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto Paul Dano and John Cusack for Love And Mercy. (By the way, I'm aware it's an ampersand in the official title of Love And Mercy, but blogger has a glitch and won't display an ampersand properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someone call Google! Ironically, the song itself IS styled "Love And Mercy," so there.) BEST ACTRESS 1. (tie) Anne Dorval for Mommy -- 23 pts. (tie) Kitana Kiki Rodriguez for Tangerine -- 23 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronit Elkabetz for Gett: The Trial Of Viviane Amsalem -- 14 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rooney Mara for Carol -- 12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bel Powley for The Diary Of A Teenage Girl -- 11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Here's the big victory for Mommy , a film by previous IRA winner Xavier Dolan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can see his new movie was a player in numerous categories throughout the night, from the first award voted on (Best Costumes) right up to the top award (Best Picture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, despite our passionate appreciation for Dolan and his work, most voters weren't able to catch Tom At The Farm, a 2013 film of his that finally had a blink-and-you-miss-it commercial run in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least IRA members have long memories: Mommy came out in January of 2015 but that didn't stop us from honoring it at our ceremony 14 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alexander Skarsgård for The Diary Of A Teenage Girl -- 18 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Keaton for Spotlight -- 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karren Karagulian for Tangerine -- 9 pts. 4. (tie) Steve Carell for The Big Short --7 pts. (tie) Emory Cohen for Brooklyn -- 7 pts. (tie) Michael Fassbender for Slow West -- 7 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: This was the only win for The Diary Of A Teenage Girl, one of the best films of the year (at least according to me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was admired by those who saw it but not enough voters did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And here you can see that getting Oscar attention is no barrier to IRA attention, with Spotlight, The Big Short and Brooklyn all getting some support for various elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Mya Taylor for Tangerine by acclamation. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mya Taylor for Tangerine -- 26 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suzanne Clément for Mommy -- 13 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Jason Leigh for The Hateful Eight -- 9 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elizabeth Banks for Love And Mercy -- 6 pts. 5. (tie) Jane Fonda for Youth -- 5 pts. (tie) Greta Gerwig for Mistress America -- 5 pts. (tie) Marcia Gay Harden for Grandma -- 5 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: If a majority of the voters participating in the IRAs each year (some members vote in absentia via ballot) all nominate the same person or film in a category, that nominee is the winner by acclamation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They garnered a majority of support on the first ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We then go through our ballots to see the other honorees, but the winner is foreordained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with every category, once a winner is announced, there is a vote on whether to rescind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps a core group liked one performance -- enough to score the most points -- but a majority hated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or perhaps a majority want to see the runner-up win instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In cases of a first round winner by acclamation, since a majority of the people already picked it, a vote to rescind has never prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST NONFICTION FILM 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Jackson Heights -- 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amy -- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listen To Me, Marlon -- 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison Of Belief -- 11 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Call Me Lucky -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Recent years have seen a flurry of new categories and renaming of old ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year, the IRAs have included the category of "Best Nonfiction Film." Documentaries and other nonfiction works have triumphed at the IRAs in years past, notably the PBS civil rights masterpiece Eyes On The Prize and the art film Decasia (which married decaying scraps of old movies to a new score by Michael Gordon to haunting effect).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, those are the ONLY two nonfiction films to triumph and these movies have rarely even made a dent in the Top Five Best Picture race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After much debate and worry that creating this category meant a nonfiction film would never garner the top prize again, it has been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, this will encourage more watching of nonfiction films by members and increase its chances of being honored in all eligible areas, like editing and director and score and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCREENPLAY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Donald Margulies for The End Of The Tour -- 23 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for The Big Short -- 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ronit Elkabetz and Shlomi Elkabetz for Gett: The Trial Of Viviane Amsalem -- 13 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck for Mississippi Grind --11 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xavier Dolan for Mommy -- 9 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Baker and Radium Cheung for Tangerine -- 28 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emmanuel Lubezki for The Revenant -- 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valentyn Vasyanovych for The Tribe -- 9 pts. 4. (tie) Mátyás Erdély for Son Of Saul -- 8 pts. (tie) Edward Lachman for Carol -- 8 pts. (tie) Robert Richardson for The Hateful Eight -- 8 pts. (tie) André Turpin for Mommy -- 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: In a year filled with impressive cinematography, one could hardly go wrong in naming a well-shot movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four films tied for fourth place and all of them deserved to be singled out, along with others that didn't make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology is such that everything from the "shot on an iPhone" Tangerine" to the "spare no expense" cutting edge work on The Revenant can look great, serve the story and make a film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the IRA voters are not ones to embrace empty craft: all the films listed had their adherents, though arguably The Hateful Eight is the exception that proved the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one touted it as one of the best films of the year, but it was still appreciated for both some of the acting and the old fashioned virtues of shooting on film, not to mention the almost perverse stunt of choosing an extreme aspect ratio and yet setting most of the film inside a one room lodge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN 1. (tie) Judy Becker for Carol -- 18 pts. (tie) Colin Gibson for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Digby for Ex Machina -- 15 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keith P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cunningham for Love And Mercy -- 11 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vlad Odudenko for The Tribe -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Here it was clear that Mad Max: Fury Road had a lot of admirers, much as it swept the technical categories at the Academy Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And just like the Oscars, the technical awards are the only ones that Mad Max: Fury Road would win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since we display our ballots, you can see how close Mad Max: Fury Road did, garnering a Top Five placement in Best Picture and Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When some mocked voting for Mad Max: Fury Road by dismissing it as an Oscar winner, others asked what was so wrong with that? Must the IRAs invariably avoid movies that win Oscars? Naturally, if the IRAs merely repeated the same movies that garnered attention from the New York and LA critics, the Golden Globes and the Oscars, or even the Spirit Awards and other bodies, it wouldn't have much reason for being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, the IRAs have a strong independent and international bias that means there is often very little overlap in the major awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's even little overlap in the more indie-leaning awards, perhaps due to the idiosyncratic nature of IRA voters, their willingness to search out truly obscure movies (usually all the movies appearing on Best Of The Year list have been vetted by at least some IRA voters) or who knows, a wealth of good movies in a world where more than 1000 films are released in New York City each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCORE/MUSIC 1. (tie) Junkie XL for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 14 pts. (tie) Atticus Ross and Brian Wilson for Love And Mercy - - 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rich Vreeland for It Follows -- 13 pts. 4. (tie) Carter Burwell for Carol -- 11 pts. (tie) Jóhann Jóhannsson for Sicario --11 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: It's not official yet, but there's a desire to official rename Best Music or Best Score to the more appropriate category of "Best Use Of Music." Did Brian Wilson write a score for the movie Love And Mercy? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But his music from Pet Sounds is ingeniously used in the film to illuminate the creative process, complete with Paul Dano recording new vocals and showing songs in various stages of completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Platoon made a brilliant use of pre-existing music, as did 2001: A Space Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love And Mercy does something different and bolder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet none of it is as easy as you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just slapping some Beethoven on your images isn't going to win you an IRA or make your movie good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather than worry about what's new and what's pre-existing and which percentage of which to credit a film for, we have simply been appreciating the movies that make the best use of music, whatever their source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST EDITING 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sean Baker for Tangerine -- 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Margaret Sixel for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 18 pts. 3. (tie) Chris King for Amy -- 12 pts. (tie) Valentyn Vasyanovych for The Tribe -- 12 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stevan Riley for Listen To Me Marlon -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Documentaries often score highly in the editing category because they typically include a wealth of footage and the movie is "discovered" in the editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year Tangerine triumphed, arguably because its non-professional cast and loose nature meant this too was a feature film more than most that found its shape in the editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST COSTUME 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shih-Ching Tsou for Tangerine -- 29 pts. 2. (tie) Sandy Powell for Carol and Cinderella -- 20 pts. (tie) Jenny Beavan for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 20 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emma Potter for The End Of The Tour -- 11 pts. 5. (tie) Xavier Dolan for Mommy -- 10 pts. (tie) Danny Glicker for Love And Mercy -- 10 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Sure, as some noted Tsou was essentially raiding the wardrobes of the actors in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's the one who chose which outfits to wear so it's still valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether you craft a costume from scratch, alter a pre-existing one or piece together vintage clothes, you're making artistic choices every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Assassin -- 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hateful Eight -- 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Magic Mike XXL -- 9 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black Mass -- 7 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jurassic World -- 6 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Arguably the funniest story of the night revolved around a screening of The Assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That led to a brief torrent of similar tales about watching a movie with the talent present -- if you know the director/star/producers are there and the movie is bad, it can be excruciating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't know they're there, it can be embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick) 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chi-Raq -- 15 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stonewall -- 13 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Martian -- 12 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Danish Girl -- 10 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wher e To Invade Next -- 8 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: No one is harder on liberals than liberals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So four of the ﬁve ﬁlms mentioned here are "progressive" by any standard yet that won't protect them from brickbats for the worse failing of making bad art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MECHANICAL ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eddie Redmayne for The Danish Girl -- 25 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carrie Fisher for Star W ars: The For ce Awakens -- 13 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angelina Jolie Pitt for By The Sea -- 8 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meryl Streep for Ricki And The Flash and Suffragette - - 6 pts. 5. (tie) Laura Dern for 99 Homes -- 5 pts. (tie) Lily Tomlin for Grandma -- 5 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: The Mechanical awards are for actors relying on familiar tricks we've seen them personally use time and again or those tackling a role in a cliched manner .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a moment for poisonous comments, getting revenge on movies and talent we once admired that have let us down or never fooled us in the ﬁrst place but keep making moves we have to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year , the IRAs honored the transgender women of Tangerine but perhaps undermined that timely nod by cheekily naming Eddie Redmayne Mechanical Actress for his performance in The Danish Girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmayne is of course authentically male (as they say) and portrays a character who begins as outwardly male but comes to realize and claim her authentic self as Lily , becoming one of the ﬁrst people in the world to under go sur gery as part of her transition to claiming her identity as a woman. (Whew , had to be careful there!) Some strongly objected (I mean you, Andy), feeling this was disrespectful to women and transgender actors and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While somewhat of a joke, this award also drove home the belief that in fact Redmayne's performance and the "tragic" ﬁlm The Danish Girl was in fact inauthentic and thus this belief was driven home by giving him the award in the "wrong" category .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that Tangerine triumphed in numerous categories, including honors for its two main talents, will hopefully balance out any outrage over this choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MECHANICAL ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Cusack for Chi-Raq and Love And Mercy -- 19 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matt Damon for The Martian -- 10 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jef f Daniels for The Martian -- 7 pts. 4. (tie) Jesse Eisenber g for The End Of The T our -- 5 pts. (tie) Tom Hardy for The Revenant -- 5 pts. (tie) Chris Hemsworth for Blackhat and In The Heart Of The Sea -- 5 pts. (tie) R yan Reynolds for Woman In Gold -- 5 pts. (tie) Tom Sturridge for Far Fr om The Madding Cr owd -- 5 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: So you can spot a groundswell of dislike for The Martian in the negative awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike The Revenant, the Ridley Scott ﬁlm had no champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly , a few really liked John Cusack in the generally admired Beach Boys movie Love And Mer cy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a strong contingent -- indeed most of the voters -- felt he was the central ﬂaw in that movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone, however , agreed his turn in Spike Lee's Chi-Raq was surreally strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately , since a majority of voters included both performances in their vote, the minority who would have preferred just to single out his work in Chi-Raq had to either ignore Cusack entirely or give points to an award that would reﬂect the will of the voters and mention both movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PAST IRA WINNERS THE COMPLETE IRA MOVIE AWARD WINNERS 1975
