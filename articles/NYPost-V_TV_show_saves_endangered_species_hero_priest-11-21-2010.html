That makes Father Jack Landry practically one of kind in prime time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novelty is not lost on Joel Gretsch, the actor who plays Father Landry. "I grew up in a small town in Minnesota," says Gretsch, "and there was a seminary -- the biggest one in the country -- about six miles from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd go to leadership camp there every summer. "I was around a lot of priests who werevery influential in my life in an extraordinary way." "V" is a remake of the popular, 1983 miniseries about a fleet of alien space ships that appear one day over the major cities of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Visitors," as the aliens call themselves, promisetheir intent is peaceful and that they only want to help humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a few humans learn early on that the Visitors are not what they claim to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the opening moment of the new series -- which switched from NBC to ABC in the intervening 27 years -- people are shown flocking to their houses of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In times of fear andconfusion, naturally people turn to faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's where the novelty of the Father Jack character -- who was not in the original -- comes in, because the priest is one of the few who realize the Vistorsare up to no good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More Print Sponsored Links Get Renting Advice Entertainment Best western Embrace the madness Just kidding...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Home TVMovies Music Fashion Theater Food Travel Pets Events Comics &amp; Games Columnists Blogs Horoscope Lifestyle NYC Local Business OpinionNews Vacay-Rod Alex Rodriguez and Cameron Diaz have their very own hot- stove...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gossip Celeb Photos PopWrapPage Six Family feud Uber-conservative Stephen Baldwin is bracing for a Baldwin...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teams High Schools Scores Sports Feeling 'Melo MEMPHIS — With each day, the Nets confidence seems to grow that...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS VIDEOS BLOGS 30 ° Today's Paper Login Register Classifieds Archives Subscribe More in Photos Click on Each Photo Video More in Videos VIEWED COMMENTEDMost Popular 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family feud 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spidey's tangled web 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hubby would take back 'vow' 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rabbi indicted on murder charges in killing of ex-cop 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; End for Andy? "Father Jack can't be, 'Okay, let's just hold hands and pray,' " says Gretsch. "He knows, 'I have to do something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ihave to do stuff, and people are going to possibly get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're in a war, and when you go to war there are going tobe casualties.' " The priest cannot go public with his knowledge about the aliens, so he joinsa group of insurgents -- including a long- sought-after terrorist and an alien defector -- to wage guerilla war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gretsch -- who was raised Catholic and is married with two children to William Shatner's daughter -- is ready for a flesh-and-blood man of the cloth who fights the aliens, agonizes over "collateral damage" and, yes, finds his faith tested by a growing bond with beautiful FBI agent Erica Evans(Elizabeth Mitchell).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 46-year-old actor is glad the show didn't take the obvious route where "the collar comes flying off," as he put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His priestly "naivete and trying to look at the good of people" are weaknesses the stunning alien leader, Anna, will try to exploit this season, Gretsch says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't be surprised to see the attraction between Father Jack and Evans become even more noticeable when the 10 episode-run of Season 2 begins in January. (Season 1 of the series just came out on DVD.) "Throughout this second season, you're going to see that struggle in many ways," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Sign Up to see what your friends like. 5 More PrintNYPOST Comments (0) You must be logged in to leave comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Login ι RegisterCurrency from Amex: Earn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sign Up Online Now! getcurrency.com Business On Main Articles, Tools &amp; Resources for Small Business, Connected by Sprint! www.BusinessOnMain.com How to Fall Asleep?
