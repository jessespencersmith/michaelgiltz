                <p>Theater: "Great God Pan" Makes Some Sweet Music THE GREAT GOD PAN ** 1/2 out of **** PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZON Amy Herzog's play has opened to strong reviews and an immediate extension and no wonder: she's a distinctive talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just seem to be a step behind others in where I thinkher work has developed. 4000 Miles was a less ambitious play that didn't quite add up, but which was given an excellent production at Lincoln Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Playwrights Horizonhas given her more ambitious new play a flawed but sympathetic staging that reflects theweaknesses in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our hero is Jamie (Jeremy Strong) who is meeting with a childhood acquaintance named Frank (Keith Nobbs) -- "friend" seems too strong a word for two men who haven't seeneach other since they were seven years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's not too strong a word for Frank whohas reached out to Jamie and clearly has some momentous news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frank is taking legalaction against his father for molestation and thinks perhaps that Jamie was molested byFrank's father as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie is polite but firm: he doesn't have any story totell, any repressed memory to dredge up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Jamie is too restrained, too tamped downand we soon realize he's been more disturbed by Frank's revelation than he let on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie has a beautiful girlfriend Paige (Sarah Goldberg), a former dancer who now provides counseling and is working towards an advanced degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've been together for years and yet never married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige's good news that she's pregnant freaks him out and he doesn't know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needless to say, she's upset and angry while Jamie keeps asking for more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He hasn't even told her about Frank's implication that Jamie was molested himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Could he forget such a thing? And why, wonders Paige, isn't he closer tohis parents? Why is he so closed off to everyone? April 30, 2014 This is the print preview: Back to normal view Â» Posted: 12/20/2012 2:43 pmThe Great God Pan isn't really about whether Jamie was molested (it seems certain he was) but more about how that might have a ripple effect throughout his life and the lives of those around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's about memory and what we hold onto and what we forget.Moment to moment it has some compelling scenes and the acting is solid throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butthere are too many loose ends, too many dramatic cul de sacs in a short play like this;they don't feel like a messy reflection of life but rather the result of a first draft of asharper, better work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The scenic design by Mark Wendland is striking on first view: it echoes the play's repeated references to a childhood memory about jamie and Frank going down to a small creek to play, led by their favorite babysitter Polly (Joyce Van Patten), who would recite theElizabeth Barrett Browning poem "A Musical Instrument" to them time and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the set is dominated by a leafy, green expanse that's beautiful but a bit dense and smothering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A giant wall of sorts dominates the middle of the stage with slabs of set sliding in and out to become a park bench, a couch at home and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The greenery becomes a bit monotonous despite the work of lighting designer Japhy Weideman and sound designer Darron I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; West to create different moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldberg is not terribly sympathetic as Jamie's girlfriend, reacting with one of those annoying "that explains everything" riffs to his confession that Frank suggested Jamie might have been molested too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if it does explain everything, no one wants to hear they've been "figured out." Goldberg is better in her scenes counseling an anorexic teenager (Erin Wilhelmi, excellent in a small turn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, those scenes are some of themost interesting in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's unclear whether we're supposed to understand thatPaige is doing a poor job of counseling (you're not supposed to break down in front ofyour clients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More to the point, what do these scenes have to do with the play? Perhapswe're meant to see the anorexia as a symptom of some deeper issue (maybe sexual fearsor -- though it's not hinted at -- molestation) the same way Jamie's alleged emotionalwalls are now seen as a symptom of his possible childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other than a banalconnection like that, I'm not sure why this subplot was included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for Jamie's "distance" from his parents, we have to take Paige's word on it; I'm not sure what Herzog intended here either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seems to get along well with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure theywish he'd visit more but so does every parent in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie meets with both hismom and dad at different times and their interactions are not awkward or cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His momCathy (the always rock solid Becky Ann Baker who looks exactly the same as she did 13years ago on TV's Freaks &amp; Geeks but prettier and thinner) has a weird reaction to Jamie's first tentative revelation that Frank was molested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her reaction -- in which she lashes outat Megan's Law over registering sex offenders -- is later explained by her feeling defensiveover possibly endangering Jamie. (He spent a week or so at Frank's house when hisparents were having marital issues.) She might have reacted in a dozen different ways toexpress her defensiveness, but this one was confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another anecdote that leads us down the wrong path appears when Jamie visits that now- aged babysitter Polly in a nursing home and they talk about the time she fell into the riverand was covered in mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Jamie, it's a painful memory -- at the time he covered hiseyes as Frank cried and Polly came out of the creek looking a mess; Jamie couldn't bear tolook at her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How does it relate to the story at hand? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie is constantly wrestling with memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is he suppressing the time Frank's dad molested him at the age of five or did it never happen? Maybe Frank's dad only fantasizedabout doing so and now it's a memory he believes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Always bad with details and the like,jamie fixates on one clear memory: the scratchy sofa in Polly's home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Polly insistsshe didn't have a scratchy sofa, naturally we think that perhaps Jamie is finallyremembering a scratchy sofa at Frank's house, a sofa where perhaps Frank's dad did some horrible thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no, later Jamie's mom says she remembers that scratchy sofa too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Friedman as Jamie's dad is given a clearer scene with his son and scores well,explaining to Jamie about their marital troubles way back when and why Jamie's momacted so weirdly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's honest, straightforward and clear, something most scenes do not offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even that poem by Elizabeth Barrett Browning seems poorly used despite being quoted at key moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem is that they never quote the most germane passage, the one that takes the great god Pan to task for hacking down a reed to make a flute for hismusical pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pan enjoys himself but the true gods know the price of despoiling thereed is too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's indicative of Herzog's talent: she creates vivid characters andintriguing premises but as of yet is circling around the real issue without quite getting tothe heart of the matter, without sucking out the pith of her characters and playing themwith the mastery she evinces in fits and starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Carolyn Cantor directs the castsmoothly but she or the dramaturg (if any) should work harder to ask questions andchallenge and force Herzog to become the better playwright her talent deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE THEATER SEASON 2012-2013 (on a four star scale) As You Like it (Shakespeare in the Park withLily Rabe) **** Chimichangas And Zoloft * Closer Than Ever *** Cock ** 1/2 Harvey with Jim Parsons * My Children!
