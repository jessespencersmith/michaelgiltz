                <p>... en New York Post, Thursday, July 13, 2006 nypost.com " -.. - 'Boondocks' new season on hold By MICHAEL GILTZ 'BOONDOCKS," Cartoon Network's witty, controÂ­ versial series, won't reÂ­ turn this year as expected, says show creator Aaron McGruder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second season of the aniÂ­ mated series, based on the "Boondocks" comic strip, was given a late 2006/winter 2007 date to return to Cartoon NetÂ­ work's late-night block, Adult Swim: after its hugely successÂ­ ful first season (it was the highest-rated series premiere in Cartoon Network history).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Network execs, in fact, bumped the number of "BoonÂ­ docks" episodes up from 15 to 20 -which seems to have conÂ­ tributed to the delay. "Our production schedule is really, really long," says McGruder, who's publicizing , the first-season DVD (Sony; $49.95). "We're halfway through the writing and just getting under way with the animation." McGruder now says fans should look for the series to reÂ­ turn in March. "Boondocks," which gives "Chappelle's Show" a run for its money in smartly tackling issues of race and politics, deÂ­ picts Huey, a IO-year-old revoÂ­ lutionary with a keen sense of leftist politics and history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He struggles to find purpose living in a white suburb with his cranky granddad and wanÂ­ nabe gangsta little brother, Riley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Boondocks" delays have spurred talk that Sony might be bringing in a new showrunÂ­ ner to replace McGruder , ruÂ­ mors dismissed by a spokesÂ­ person. (Cartoon Network execs were traveling to the TV CritÂ­ ics tour in L.A. and were unÂ­ available for comment.) But unlike Dave Chappelle , who famously walked away from his Comedy Central sc- o ries after snaring a $55 million deal, this clearly isn't a case of McGruder losing interest or feeling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's more about an artist wanting to do the best work he can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One episode from last seaÂ­ son, for instance, featured an anime-style fight between Huey and Riley. "That was fun," says McGruder, 32. "It's also been our biggest challenge. "We're creating a new sysÂ­ tem on-the-fly to get an auÂ­ thentic anime style but still have it be written with an American comedic sensibility, "It's really hard," he says. "We're working more and more with artists overseas, We now have a Japanese anime studio named Madhous e to help us out. "I was happy with a lot of season one, but I thought a lot of it could look better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're really passionat e artists, 'The people working with me on the show are phenomeÂ· nal, phenomenal artists and they really care about getting it right."</p>
