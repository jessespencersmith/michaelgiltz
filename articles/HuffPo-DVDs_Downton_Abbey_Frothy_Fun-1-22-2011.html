Ginsberg never looked like this in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, even Neal Cassady -- the siren of the Beats -- never looked as good as James Franco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actor holds the screenvery nicely in 127 Hours (when that movie isn't desperate to jazz up the story of a man trapped in a dangerous spot).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, Howl is worried about presenting a poem at the heart of its film so we hear Franco reciting it in a Ginsbergian manner, we see grainy black and white footage of Ginsberg reading itto an audience for the first time, we watch animated imaginings of the action of the poem and weexamine it legally as the poem is dissected in a trial where the good lawyer is played by Jon Hamm and the bad lawyer who thinks it is vulgar is embodied by a hapless David Strathairn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it sounds like a lot is going on, it shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film is inert dramatically, with the cardboard villains of the trial (a mousyMary Louise Parker and a smarmy Jeff Daniels) never leaving any doubt what the judge will decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest is just smoke and mirrors as they dole out sections of the poem piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The film should have been a documentary -- and made 20 or 30 years ago, ideally, so they could capture more people whenthey were alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fictional film, no matter how inventive and jazz-like it may be, hasn't done the job.DVD extras are more compelling, including interviews done with Ginsberg friends, a 1995 performance by Ginsberg doing "Howl" at the Knitting Factory, Franco reading it himself and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oddly, they don't include the one extra I expected: a fully animated version of "Howl" that would piece together all thesections that were glimpsed in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So many people loved the animation that it's a shame they didn't finish the job. 1 of 5 Harry Shearer The President’s Panacea for Business Regs: The Cost-Benefit Ratio Sec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kathleen Sebelius Health Care Repeal Will Raise Costs for FamiliesDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS ashton kutcher jennifer aniston rehab kourtney kardashian natalie portman pregnant nicki minaj More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Michelle Bombshell To Kat Von D: He WILL Cheat On You Comments (712) New Scam Spreads Like Wildfire On Facebook Comments (407) Suspect in 1987 Infant Kidnapping Surrenders READ MORE John Travolta's BabyBenjamin: Youngest Copilot Ever?

I failed?) and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very few TV series can end at the right time and on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This one did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The West Homelessness Education Israel NBA Predict the News MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST HEARTBREAKER ($24.98; IFC) -- The premise of this French romantic comedy is so high concept and commercial I imagine the Hollywood remake was being shot even before this version hit theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Romain Duris is a romancer-for-hire, paid lavish sums by families and friends to woo away adaughter/sister/friend before she commits to a loser that everyone can see is a disaster in the making.Duris of course wins her heart and then walks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the tagline works: "He's broken every heart except his own...until now." What? You mean he's going to actually fall for one of the gorgeous women he's asked to seduce? I don't believe it! Yes, the film is Hollywood down to its core, including predictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is one very amusing scene where Duris practices dance moves copied from Dirty Dancing (the favorite film of the girl he's assigned to win).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollywood should keep that scene and work hard on improving the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA ($24.98 BluRay; Warner Bros.) LOST IN TRANSLATION ($26.98; Universal) -- I remember seeing director Sergio Leone's gangster epic with my friend Lisa back in high school... and being thoroughly confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was quite a while before I discovered that the American distributor had slashed about an hour and a half from the film and turned it into a nonsensical mess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll still rank his westerns higher, but in its restored version of 229 minutes,this is a mature, compelling work featuring Robert De Niro, Elizabeth McGovern (currently in Downton Abbey ), Joe Pesci and a manic James Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A must-see for anyone who loves gangster films and period epics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lost In Translation was overpraised but it's a good film with two very nice performances and for that director Sofia Coppola deserves full credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This BluRay is nothing special, but then the movie wasn'tvisually flashy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And no, even with improved sound you still can't hear what he's saying at the end.BIG LOVE SEASON FOUR ($59.99; HBO)JUSTIFIED FIRST SEASON ($39.95; Sony) LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE VINTAGE 1987 ($34.98; BBC) ENEMY AT THE DOOR SEASON 2 ($59.99; Acorn) -- The HBO polygamy drama Big Love seems to be fading out, rather than building to the big finale that a show with such critical acclaim deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps like me you've just been waiting for the DVDs to catch up with the series that will surely be at the top of Bill Paxton's resume for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justified has a lot going for it, namely the zing of Elmore Leonard's original creation and the sturdy presence of Timothy Olyphant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He continues to growas an actor (and a star, which isn't exactly or always the same thing) and this series seemed to improve a bit as the season went on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A good fix for those who need a modern western.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you ever need a fix of senior citizen sitcoms and Golden Girls just doesn't do it for you anymore, there's always the UK show Last Of The Summer Wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the longest running sitcom in world history and focuses on retired old men who shuffle around and get into jams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harmless, sweet, but I feel like they'll be releasing DVDs ofthe various seasons (this one is from 1987) for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, a boxed set of the entire run to date might just crush someone to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I was so gutted over the unexpected cancellation ofIsland At War (whose creator died), that I've been relieved and guilty over discovering Enemy at the Door, an earlier UK series with the same setting: British subjects living in the Nazi-occupied Channel Islands during WW II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good fun, but I do feel like I'm cheating a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PUNK: ATTITUDE ($19.93; Shout) -- Another sterling reissue from Shout, this 2005 Don Letts film about the punk movement covers the obvious bases (the Ramones, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, etc.) with seriousness and thoroughness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, it could be twice as long but this is well-done, with a standout interview from Henry Rollins anchoring the history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This two disc set has loads of extras, including in-depth looks at the US versus the UK, women in punk, fanzines and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essential for fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANIMAL KINGDOM ($34.95 BluRay or $28.95 regular DVD; Sony) -- A brutal, critically acclaimed Aussie gangster pic where the cops are just as dirty as the criminals, Animal Kingdom is essential viewing for Oscar buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because Jacki Weaver is a likely contender for best supporting actress forher lacerating portrayal of a mother that makes Medea seem like a Sunday school teacher. (If Melissa Leoand Amy Adams split the vote for The Fighter, she might just triumph this time around.)ELSEWHERE ($29.98; Icarus) -- This is definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Nikolaus Geyrhalter took an HD camera and headed...everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He spent one month per location and went to 12 places on five continents, capturing ways of life that can take your breathaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He spends 20 minutes of film time on each place, so the rhythm is established early in this fourhour movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a bit much to see all at once, especially since each individual segment is rarely eye- opening or insightful in any particular way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the overall effect is notable: all of this is going on in our world, right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People in the rainforest wearing next to nothing, Finnish men keeping an eye on theirreindeer and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From the desert to ice floes to the jungle, ultimately you're just struck by the diversityof human existence and a bit of envy that the filmmakers got to experience it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some images are beautiful but by and large it's workmanlike and rightly so: here we are, it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pretty amazing, isn't it? DOCTOR WHO: MEGLOS / DOCTOR WHO: THE DOMINATORS ($24.98 each; BBC) -- 47 years, countless episodes and still they dole out Doctor Who from the past like it's a scarce commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Igrew up with Tom Baker's Doctor but even I can't say much for "Meglos," a so-so storyline towards the end of his run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't really know Patrick Troughton's run from 1966-1969, but "The Dominators" is abit livelier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both complete storylines come with some very respectable extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet someday -- surely,someday -- they'll do it right and come out with complete boxed sets for each Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, it has beenVideos Web Images YouTube Downton Abbey ITV1 promo YouTube Hugh Bonneville 'Downton Abbey' Interview Hulu NBC TODAY Show: McGovern Is High On ‘Downton Abbey’ 85 71 27TOP INFLUENCERS ON THIS TOPIC Matthew Perry &amp; Matt LeBlanc's Onscreen Love...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MTV's 'Skins' Airs Teen Lesbian Love Scene...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elton John, 'Glee' Star Matthew Morrison Duet Thoughts on The King's Speech, and Other...20 or 30 or 40 years; they've had enough time to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, start that theme song up and I'm sucked right back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He typically does not guarantee coverage and invariably receives far more screeners and DVDs than he can cover each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Michael Giltz freelances as a writer of DVD copy (the text that appears on the back ofDVDs) for some titles released by IFC and other subsidiaries of MPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It helps pay the rent, but does notobligate him in any way to speak positively or negatively of their titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KNME 10pm-9.1: Downton Abbey - Part 2 | MASTERPIECE http://bit.ly/iaUbZl 19 hours ago from HootSuite ebertchicago Complete UK version of "Downton Abbey." 3 DVDs, 368 minutes, $17, half price. http://amzn.to/ewDik5 20 hours ago from SocialOomph stevegarfield Gt it ; ) RT @whirred @stevegarfield Maybe you'd settle for Downton Comments 1 Pending Comments 0View FAQ 371 Fans Downton Abbey is absolutely the best thing on PBS since the new Sherlock!
