Ask them about Bobby Kennedy and the ache in their voice will be palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read this new biography and you'll understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While unquestionably approving of the manBobby Kennedy ultimately became, Robert Tye's work deepens and complicates this fascinating figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When tragedy strikes (as it often does for the Kennedys and the country in this era), Tye does tend to feel that Bobby felt it more deeply than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also depicts Bobby as almost single-handedly inventing modern political campaigns when surely precedentand the innovations of others come into play as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other than that, he's notably hard-headed and eager not to let BobbyShare This Book About The Author Larry Tye MoreLarry Tye has been an award-winning journalist at The Boston Globe and a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He now runs aBoston-based training program for medical journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Satchel, as well as Superman, The…and Rising from the Rails, and co-author, with Kitty Dukakis, of Shock .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He lives in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $32.00 (Hardcover) Published: July 05, 2016 Publisher: Random House Pages: 608 ISBN 10: 0812993349 ISBN 13: 9780812993349off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It charts his childhood as the almost ignored Kennedy, lost among the large brood and overshadowed by his brothers Joe and Jack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tye comes into his own amidst politics, with Kennedy as a diligent investigator for the anti- communist crusade of Senator Joe McCarthy and then just as eagerly against the corrupt unions personified by Hoffa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He makes mistakes, he changes, he grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When confronted by black activists with passionate denunciations, Bobby isdefensive and argues back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a day or two later, he amends his worldview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When future activists take him to task (he'sthe first public figure they get a chance to lambaste), Bobby learns to listen and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, Tye showshim developing into the liberal icon of his book's subtitle and our imagination: turning from hawk to dove via the Cuban Missile Crisis, becoming "radicalized" when dealing with segregation down south and migrant farm workers out west or seeing little children with swollen bellies of the sort you'd expect once upon a time in Africa but not America in the 1960s.Tye's new facts include a better and more believable depiction of the famous phone calls made in sympathy of Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MartinLuther King Jr. by Jack and Bobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better still is his argument that it was the black vote that sealed their victory, not theshady dealings that bought votes here and there (as it undoubtedly did).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book gains momentum as Bobby gains passion, learning and growing every step of the way, until you're so excited about what he might do...and then disaster strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't read any other biographies of Bobby Kennedy (or really the Kennedys in general) so I can't speak to whatnew insights if any that Tye offers here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for someone barely alive when Bobby died, he makes that loss as depressing asever, one of the great "what-ifs" in US history. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “Larry Tye has done his homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has read the books and articles, interviewed hundreds of family members, friends, colleagues and acquaintances, and made use of newly released materials in the KennedyLibrary and elsewhere to produce a nuanced, balanced, affectionate and mostly favorable portrait. . . . [Tye]presents us . . . with a kind of bildungsroman of a young, privileged man who is forced to learn on the job andmakes mistakes. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We are in Larry Tye’s debt for bringing back to life the young presidential candidate who .. . for a brief moment, almost half a century ago, instilled hope for the future in angry, fearful Americans.” — David Nasaw, The New York Times Book Review “Sweeping . . . [Tye] captures RFK’s rise and fall with straightforward prose bolstered by impressive research.Along with hundreds of interviews with Kennedy intimates, including his widow, Ethel, Tye sifted throughunpublished memoirs, unreleased government files, and boxes of Kennedy papers that had been locked away forsome forty years.” —USA Today “Bobby Kennedy, who was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign, is remembered for his antiwarstance… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
