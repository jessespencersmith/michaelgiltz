Not a human in sight? The sets built to 3/4 size so thisworld of monkeys would be as convincing as possible? The most expensive kids show in history, up tothat time? No, it's not an acid trip, it's Lancelot Link , that very show dimly remembered by kids in the HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity babies Green Living Republican Party Diet Chile Paul Ryan Autism NFL Custody and Child Support MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Madonna's Message For Americans: 'Don't Get Fat And Lazy' WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin ricky_martin RetweetMake Room for (the New) Daddy http://t.co/Q6eIDokm via @huffingtonpost feliciaday RetweetThink on it: Cambridge scientists say all mammals, birds, many others including octopi, havehuman-like consciousness. http://t.co/aF6W2ZQhearly 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's by no means good, but by God it's unusual and we're finally getting the entire 17 episodes in nice, cleaned up fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the final psychedelic touch, the show also featured musical numbers with our spy chimps rocking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, The Monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The primetime series Rags To Riches centers on businessman Joseph Bologna who needs to burnish up his public image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, he adopts five orphangirls and they turn his world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unexpectedly, there are also musical numbers, which happily were classics from the 1960s and earlier, rather than original tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That probably held up the DVD release (music rights are the reason we still can't watch The Wonder Years ) so it's nice to see the entire series available on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not a particularly good show from 1987, but I'm a firm believer everythingshould be available in some form so it's a welcome release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now where's Cop Rock ? TRUE BLOOD SEASON FOUR 9$79.98 BluRay; HBO) CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM SEASON EIGHT ($39.98; HBO) ENTOURAGE EIGHTH SEASON ($39.98; HBO) TOO BIG TO FAIL ($19.97; HBO) -- I hate to say it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've resisted it because money is tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I think HBO has become an essential purchase again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Entourage is walking into the sunset (bye, you lovable Hollywood playas and wannabes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here is just a new batch of HBO shows: the red hot True Blood, Curb Your Enthusiasm (which some fans are now scandalously claiming is even better than Seinfeld ), and TV movies like the Wall Street scandal Too Big To Fail, with HBO's usual stellar cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throw in Game Of Thrones, Veep, Girls, Real Time With Bill Maher and now The Newsroom and darnit if HBO has become a must-have again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASABLANCA THE COMPLETE SERIES ($39.95; Olive) -- Even as a 17 year old kid, I was scandalized when NBC launched a TV drama prequel to Casablanca , one of the greatest films of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at least they attempted this doomed-to-fail enterprise with a top-notch production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They recreatedthe sets of the film beautifully (the show received two Emmy nominations and won for Cinematography)and delivered a strong cast including Scatman Crothers, Ray Liotta, Hector Elizondo and David Soul asRick. (Since the show was a prequel, no one had to be cast to play Ingrid Bergman, who at the time of thefilm was perhaps the most beautiful woman in the world).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ran for five episodes, with NBC very tentatively beginning the run in April of 1983, about the oddest time to launch a new series one can think of back in those days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a curiosity now and would make an excellent bonus feature on a deluxe boxed set celebrating the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On its own, it's strictly for completists, though if you pretend it's not actually Casablanca but just a TV series, it was quite ambitious and had some promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such a bad idea -- and not the first time it had been acted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was an earlier TV series in 1955 that ran for ten episodes,and several musical adaptations have been tackled over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no one really wants to hear Rickbreak into song, do they?FALLING SKIES FIRST SEASON ($49.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) DOCTOR WHO RESURRECTION OF THE DALEKS ($34.98; BBC?Warner Bros.) THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES SEASON FIVE ($19.98; BBC/Warner Bros.) -- Steven Spielberg's Falling Skies is a heartfelt family drama with an alien invasion as the backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is both the show's strength and failing, though Noah Wylie anchors the series nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopefully, the action will pick up a bit in season two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having just watched the classic British drama All Creatures Great AndSmall, I especially looked forward to seeing costar Peter Davison (who played a ladies' man of an animal veterinarian) as the good Doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BBC loads up these multi-episode collections telling one long storywith excellent bonus features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is still absurdly over-priced at just 90 minutes (though they docontain the slightly longer, rawer four part version which -- oh, if you're a Who fan you probably know and if you're not you don't care).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good silly fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Jane has always been the most popular companion for the Doctor and she finally got her own series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctor Who has always been family fare but the recent reboot tilts slightly more adult and mature whereas this spin-off is definitely geared to kiddies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, the star Elizabeth Sladden died suddenly during the filming of this season and the show has ceasedproduction, so this is the final goodbye for Sarah Jane.DAMAGES COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON ($45.99; Sony) WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ($59.99; Acorn) -- Glenn Close continues to tear it up in the legal drama Damages .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you're only as good as your client or opponent and Close has a juicy one with John Goodman as the corrupt CEO of a security firm doing business in Afghanistan. (It's clearly inspired by the controversial firm Blackwater, which has now redubbed itself the hilarious inaptAcademi.) Goodman always tears into good dramatic roles when given the chance and doesn't disappointhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A similar tale of power and corruption can be enjoyed in the 1977 miniseries Washington: BehindClosed Doors, based on John Ehrlichman's post-Watergate novel The Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He knew something about paranoid presidents and this nearly 10-hour miniseries has a lot of fun, thanks to a stellar cast thatincludes Jason Robards, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Robert Vaughn, Stefanie Powers and Andy Griffith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's down and dirty rather than lavish like Shogun or The Holocaust but it's still fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WHITE COLLAR COMPLETE THIRD SEASON ($39.98; Fox) FRANKLIN &amp; BASH FIRST SEASON ($45.99; Sony) BURN NOTICE SEASON FIVE ($49.98; Fox)) TOP GEAR COMPLETE SEASON 18 ($24.98; BBC) -- I love boundary pushing, provocative television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sometimes you just want to zone out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't mean you want something stupid and with the right charismatic cast and clever than average scripts, junk food television that you can dip intoanytime without worrying about complicated story lines can be just the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; White Collar is a sterling example, thanks to devilishly handsome leading man Matt Bomer (almost the perfect name) as a con man-turned-FBI consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bomer should be answering calls from Hollywood when they want a new leading man but for the moment he's having great fun here. "We're totally lawyers" is a great tagline that perfectly captures the appeal of Franklin &amp; Bash, a buddy show about two dudes who practice law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stars Breckin Meyer and Mark-Paul Gosselaar have excellent chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in Malcolm McDowell into the mix and you've got yourself a breezy bit of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto Burn Notice , which had so much long-anticipated action (our hero returned to the CIA -- briefly -- faced down the person who burned him and so on) thatit almost felt like a series finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're back for a sixth season, however, so catch up if you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlikethe other shows, this one does have a serious overarching plot but you can still enjoy it week to week.Finally, Top Gear always gets compared to the radio show Car Talk because they both entertain even if you don't give a hoot about cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set contains the entire 18th season (including the India special anda look at China's automotive industry) plus an episode from the U.S. spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Car Talk fading into permanent reruns, this is the last refuge for gearheads.FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENT Guns N' Roses Slash Once Caught David...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson: 'Unfair' Hurricane Isaac Avoid...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Williams As Dwight D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eisenhower In...
