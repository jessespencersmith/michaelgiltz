That was cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In general, the typically smooth Seacrest was goofy and distracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CRYSTAL BOWERSOX --Sang "Saved" with backup singers and a glittery electric guitar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elvis did some of the greatest southern gospel ever -- but this is more of a fun roof-raiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kara called the lyricscontroversial for their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not quite sure why they would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great and appropriate use of backup singers (with an assist from the camerawork).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine and strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANDREW GARCIA -- Sang "Hound Dog." Adam was straightforward about Andrew's rehearsal: "that was boring." Yep, and so was his pre-song interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Started strolling back to the stage before the music was even over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe better than the rehearsal but not that good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIM URBAN -- Sang "Can't Help Falling In Love." More precise advice from Adam about singing in a higher register at the finale, which he sort of used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, it was as good as Tim can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smart song choice, smart arrangement, full Tiger Beat mode. (With Ryan dancing in the background, I believe.) Good God, could he make the Top 4? LEE DEWYZE -- Sang "A Little Less Conversation." Adam tried to break through Lee's poker face and get him to show some expression while performing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could almost see Lee thinking when he began to sing, "Oh yeah, smile." He was so focused on the crowd, he even got away from the mike for amoment...and then climaxed with his back to the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weak ending but a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And his best moment was the jokey thumbs up and smile at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AARON KELLY -- Sang "Blue Suede Shoes." Aaron was right: the song was totally wrong for him, but not because of the lyric about drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's just not a swaggerer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And where were his blue suede shoes?

"You just showed us, girl," said Kara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine, but competent doesn't cut it at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CASEY JAMES -- Sang "Lawdy Miss Clawdy." Yet more specific, good advice from Adam about the arrangement and letting it build more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casey seemed to take the advice but couldn't shake the song out of just being a groove number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the entire Elvis catalog to choose from, he couldn't choose a more propulsive number? Bad bad song choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only four good performances and none of them were great: Crystal, Tim, Lee and Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there's a bottom four, I'd say it should be Andrew Garcia, Aaron Kelly, Siobhan Magnus, and Katie Stevens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thetwo going home? Andrew and Katie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What do you think?

Brian gets hordes of publicity, hordes of internet searches, and he gets to promote hisshow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hmmmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Ryan isn't mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he's looking out for his old co-host? Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wasn't that a year ago for Dunkelman when he pitched that project? If Ryan was being nice by throwing a little publicity his way, he should have made the comment in Jan of2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unless it's come to fruition? I'm just surprised to hear Dunkleman say he chose toleave the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd always assumed they just let him go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baby Paltrow Dishes on Cruise Kiss Raven Symone's HugeWeight Loss MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Sex Animals Russia Beauty Lady Gaga Natalie Portman Golf Chile ModelsHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES »Recency | Popularity HUFFPOST SUPER USER mlrlmsw 07:31 PM on 4/15/2010 Permalink | Share it BillAnthony 11:26 PM on 4/14/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER libwingoflibwing 10:20 PM on 4/14/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:29 AM on 4/15/2010 Permalink | Share itNatalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During 'Black Swan' 124 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 806 Comments Animal Torture as Entertainment?

By this time next year Adam will be he 4th judge on Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did you know you can bet on-line as to who will win "American Idol?".... ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I got my money on Casey..... .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not too sure now after last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judges said last night that Crystal reminded them of Bonnie Raitt.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXACTLY!!! !......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how many million of albums has Bonnie sold?..... .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many stadiums has she sold out?...... .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal will make the Top Three at best! THIS JUST IN.......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brian Dunkleman has found one more reason NOT to give up drinking! I'm sure Adam Lambert wouldn't give up on his career yet by being an Idol judge (which is how it would be seen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And being a good mentor isn't the same as being a good judge --but since he was great at one, he might well be good at the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Uh, Bonnie Raitt isn't a big artist? She's won nine Grammys, sold at least 20 million albums around the world (that's 17 million for certain in the US and Canada so probably a LOTmore than that) is in the rock and roll hall of fame and has guested on 100+ albums as well as 30 hit singles in various formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comparing Crystal to her is both obvious and a huge compliment .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raitt's three decades of success is a great accomplish ment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael, You dare disagree with the man who predicted that Andrew and Katey would go home last night? I think Lambert would take the gig as Judge if offered to him.......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exposure alone would be hard to refuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, Bonnie Raitt is talented and has sold a lot of records to guys like you and me who watch PBS and read Kerouac because we think that's what intelectua ls do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But do teenage girls have her poster on their walls? Has she sold 20 millionrecords on just one record alone? You have to distinguis h between being and "artist" and being a "performer ." For my money Harry Chapin is THE greatest recording artist of the last fifty years..... .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But is he a Sinatra? Is he a Michael Jackson? An Elvis? A Taylor Hicks? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING A GREAT PERFORMER! In fact seeing a great performer is often more fun than seeing some sour looking female guitarist with no makeup who sings about her uterus and eating danish withher friends.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST HUFFPOST SUPER USER libwingoflibwing 12:57 PM on 4/16/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 05:36 PM on 4/14/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:26 AM on 4/15/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 04:17 PM on 4/15/2010 51 Fans 6 Fans 43 Fans 151 FansThere are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All I'm ready to say adios to the two prettyboys , Aaron and Tim...Hast a!

Just mean spirited for no particular reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, I'm like catcancook , Ryan has seemed off his meds for weeks now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't quite believe this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim and Katie seemed also rans early on, but now they seem to be getting better every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They both shined, incredibly enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, I thought Siobhanwould be a finalist but she has become so mannered along the way in her vocal style, it's as if sheis pod-Siobha n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big Mike sings "In The Ghetto'...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seriously? And does a rather maudlin job at that, while the judges gush to rationaliz e their having saved him (after being pilloried online for it all week).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the great Elvis R&amp;B tunes and he has to sing about the ghetto? And Casey, if ever there was a week he should've knocked it out of the park, he popped out behind home plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a wasted opportunit y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crystal is still the best, but it's starting to look like she's gonna win by default, because Siobhan andCasey, who should have given her a run for the money, have run out of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goodbye Michael andAndrew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan seemed drunk or stoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No doubt about it, he was on something and acted bazaar and disrespect ful more than on one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adam was fabulous as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was really engaged and was bopping along to the contestant s as they sand their chosen selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His advice was dead on but too bad he wasn't there to help themchoose songs that fit them better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He apparently did that for the season 8 contestant s and was responsibl e for a lot of creative suggestion s that worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER RhiannonRings 03:59 PM on 4/14/2010 Permalink | Share it anonimost 01:58 PM on 4/14/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:45 PM on 4/14/2010 Permalink | Share it catcancook 12:06 PM on 4/14/201059 FansI have only seen a couple of shows this season but I do like Siobhan's raw talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She could use some vocal coaching as well as polishing up on wardrobe,p resentatio n,etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the girl has a powerful voice which is original-- yet very untrained and she doesn't seem to know how to use her gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hadn't heard that about Adam Lambert last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interestin g -- and spotlights a generous, nice personalit y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:18 AM on 4/15/2010 Permalink | Share it</p>
