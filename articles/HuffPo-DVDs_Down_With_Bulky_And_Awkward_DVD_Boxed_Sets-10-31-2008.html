(Though we'd rather have a lower price.) But they shouldALWAYS include packaging for the DVDs that can be removed and easily stored alongside the fan'sother DVDs that they own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, that cool apehead just becomes a giant nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's arundown of current and upcoming boxed sets with an emphasis on their packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's face it,unless you're already a huge fan of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. or Knight Rider, nothing I say is going to convince you to shell out tons of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So these reviews (in alphabetical order) are forthe fans who wonder what the set is like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

BATMAN: THE COMPLETE ANIMATED SERIES ($107.92; Warner Bros.) -- A lavish, beautifully designed package that contains all 109 episodes of the excellent 90s animated series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of all the live action and animated versions of Batman (and I'm including the Christian Bale films)this is the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're not reading the original series or Frank Miller's The Dark Knight, this is what you should watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It comes in a bright, classy plastic cover and the boxed set slides out,revealing subtle detail on the black cover and inside lid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a large format booklet and onlysome flimsy cardboard dividers to spoil the nice inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But unless you are an incredible geek,where the heck are you gonna put it? It's too big for any bookcase or DVD shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But happily, theentire 17 DVDs are contained in two slim volumes that can slide right alongside your currentcollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due November 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DALLAS COWBOYS 10 GREATEST GAMES ($49.98; Warner Bros./NFL) -- Sports fans should be delirious about living in an era when so many classic sporting events are being released on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some quibble about the games chosen for this set, but 10 complete games, solid extrasand all in a slim volume that fits easily on your shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No stupid football helmet packaging to makeit bulky and useless, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE DONNA REED SHOW SEASON ONE ($39.95; Arts Alliance America) -- Another standard-sized set, this contains all 37 episodes of the solid sitcom that forever immortalized Reed as doing her house work while dressed to the nines and sporting a pearl necklace.

It's not a great show, but it is a decent one that's been burned into our collective memory via reruns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Very modest extras, but frankly I don't care and I think most fans just want easy access to the complete, original episodes as they aired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This set delivers that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE 4400: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($99.98; Paramount) -- Another well-packaged, standard-sized set containing 15 DVDs with all four seasons of this precursor to Heroes , including a few extras including hints at what direction they might have gone in if the show hadn't been cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, some people bought the single season sets as they came out, but since that'sinevitable with a new series (as opposed to classic TV), there's no reason to complain when all ofthem are collected in one neat set and some new extras are thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really, fans of Heroesshould check this out even though I still think it would have been better as a season-longtelenovela instead of an ongoing show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GREGORY PECK FILM COLLECTION ($59.98; Universal) -- Two classic Gregory Peck films ( To Kill A Mockingbird and Cape Fear ) along with four more movies new to DVD, all of them very solid ( Arabesque, Captain Newman M.D., Mirage and The World In His Arms ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sets built around an actor or director are increasingly popular, but too often they bundle all the movies together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, each film gets its own trim DVD case (and EVERY studio should convert tothe slim DVD cases -- there is no point in the bulkier ones at all).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't know about you, but if I'mlooking for the movie Captain Newman M.D., I'm gonna start with the "c's" not with the "p's" and this set lets me do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due November 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE INCREDIBLE HULK: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($149.98; Universal) -- Another giant, coffee-table sized cardboard box with a nifty, bulging plastic logo for the "Hulk" in The Incredible Hulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No muss or fuss inside, just slim DVD sets (!) containing all five seasons that can be easily placed on any shelf and then you just toss the cardboard box container it came in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do admit my childhood fancy for this show and Bill Bixby isn't quite as strong today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's good but the show got way too cartoonish by the time it ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, I'd rather watch this than either of the movies any day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KNIGHT RIDER: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ($139.98; Universal) -- Am I dissing studios for coming up with clever packaging? Yes I am, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of wasting money on elaborate packages that become annoying dust collectors or make fans have to keep these DVDs faraway from all their other ones, studios should just be a little practical and think about how peopleactually use these sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Knight Rider has a sleek black box with a lid that flips open and a nifty red light display that plays theme music and flashes lights when you press a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, it mademe smile, but not as much as the slim DVD cases containing all four seasons that could beimmediately placed on my bookcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bonus features include the 2000 TV movie sequel and otherstuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE LITTLE RASCALS: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ($89.98; Genius) -- This long- awaited set should be called "The Complete Hal Roach Talkie Collection" since it contains all 80 of the talkie shorts featuring The Little Rascals, released from 1929-1938 and repackaged and shownin reruns ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get a very nice looking but compact set that fits onto any DVD shelf orbookcase (proof that sets don't need to be bulky to be impressive) and some ok extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, theshorts don't even match some of the laser disc collections I had years ago when it comes to pictureand sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Casual fans and people with kids to entertain will be happy but those lookingfor a real restoration or even the entire 200+ shorts in the series will have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.: THE COMPLETE SERIES ($199.92; Warner Bros.) -- An identical reissue of the complete series boxed set that came out about a year ago with one key difference: the nifty suitcase it came in has been upgraded from flimsy cardboard that tore abouttwo minutes after I got it to much sturdier packaging that looks like it will last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, unlessyou plan to keep this set in the attic or closet with your other luggage, the really important fact isthat each season inside is contained in a classic-sized DVD case, this time with full info on the sideso it can be stored on your shelf and you won't wonder what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tongue-in-cheek spy show ispretty fascinating for a case study in a series that let success go to its head and then righted itself abit just as the party ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great fun and lots of extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ($69.99; Shout) is available in a standard sized boxed set that fits trimly on your shelf (hurrah!) or a limited edition that is exceptionally chubby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's sort of a super-sized tin box, fatter than a lunch box but able to fit Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Cars War Wire Video Financial Crisis Barack Obama MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

They're the ONLY people who care about the lame TV reunion movies and shouldn't be forcedto buy the complete collection to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here's the bitter truth that might make them feelvindicated: the packaging on the boxed set is so ludicrously cheap and shoddy, they wouldn't wantit anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a bulky, coffee table-sized box that won't fit anywhere except in your closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The"decorative" element inside is a colored strip that recreates the animated opening sequence of theseries: it's a thin cardboard strip glued to the top of the inside and was peeling away the moment Iopened the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The episode guide is a glorified pamphlet thrown on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worst of all, the fourseasons are not contained in standard DVD boxes the way the individual seasons were sold.(Normally, studios just plop those babies into the collection or at most repackage them intoslimmer cases.) In this case, the DVDs are contained in two flimsy, cardboard packages that areshaped sort of like boots (I guess).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DVDs flop around inside, are really hard to pull outindividually and keep in order and the whole thing is ready to get torn or fall apart at any moment.This sort of bulky, shoddy packaging that no sane person would ever want to deal with is exactlythe sort of travesty people should reject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it comes to DVD boxed sets, bigger is rarely betterand cheap packaging won't last, but the memories of annoyed customers will linger on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will you buy any of these boxed sets or are there any lavish boxed sets you love or hate?
