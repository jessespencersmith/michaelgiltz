Well, the cast has something to prove and sometimes the audiences says"critics, who needs 'em; we like it!" (If an audience member sees a bad show before it opens, then they love being a critic and get to tell their friends, "Stay away!") The least enjoyable possibility when seeing a show afterit opens is that it gets bad reviews and everyone just politely soldiers on as best they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pros on stage muster what enthusiasm they can ("Should I pause for another beat here? Maybe that'll get a laugh.") and the audience does its best to be encouraging and not look at their watches too often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly, the latter is the case for Relatively Speaking, three one acts with a cast of 15 and direction by John Turturro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wouldn't single out any of them for the mess here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That rests squarely with writers Ethan Coen, Elaine May, and Woody Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TALKING CURE * out of **** Coen's play is split into two parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It opens in a fenced off area at a mental hospital, with a doctor (Jason Kravitz) trying to engage a new patient (Danny Hoch) in therapy.

(It's hard to get inspired by poor material, but this particular set design by the great Santo Loquasto is a puzzle.) We soon realize it's the parents of the patient; they're bickering and fighting on the night when he's going to be born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the doctor and patient as solemn witnesses, theparents kvetch with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're expected to gain some insight into him, I suppose, but since we barely know the patient or even really what he's done, there's no mystery to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parents (Allen Lewis Rickman and Katherine Borowitz) are given slightly peppier, funnier dialogue, but only slightly.This too just peters to a close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coen's play barely even constitutes a rough draft for a one act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GEORGE IS DEAD ** out of **** Elaine May's one act has the benefit of featuring the night's most fully realized performance, thanks to Marlo Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She totters on stage as Doreen, a self-absorbed rich woman who shows up on the doorstep of the daughter of her childhood nanny, a nanny she hasn't spoken to for decades. (How the shallow and indifferent Doreen would know where to find the married daughter of a nanny she hasn'tspoken to in 30 or 40 years is the sort of question one isn't meant to ask.) "George is dead!" announcesDoreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her husband has died on a ski slope in Aspen and Doreen is at her wit's end, which clearly doesn't take much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overwhelmed Carla (Lisa Emery) soon finds herself playing nanny as well by scraping salt off of Doreen's crackers, finding her a nightie, giving her a couch to sleep on, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'snothing terribly new, but Thomas has fun with this privileged, silly woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In bursts Carla's husband (they'd been fighting) and they have it out again as the play turns a tad more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fewer and fewer laughs appear as the husband leaves and next morning the nanny, the belovedaged nanny, arrives to dress Doreen for the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This piece is the only one to really even attempt a kicker, a closing line meant to nail the humor on the head as the curtain falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't work (the anger is misplaced, really, so the joke doesn't land and after so much seriousness it kind of seems serious, too).But at least she tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONEYMOON MOTEL ** out of **** It's a pretty generous two stars out of four, but at least Woody Allen's playlet has some rat-a-tat humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like the tired routine Allen tosses in about the terrible food back in the old country, the jokes are pretty awful, but there sure are a lot of 'em.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this light comedy, Steve Guttenberg is head over heels in love with his much-younger bride (Ari Graynor) as they giggle their way into a tacky motel room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Guttenberg's best pal shows up, the MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Girl Accidentally Hangs Herself At Haunted House IT'S OVER: Kim Kardashian Files For Divorce Googlers Carve 1,000 Pound Pumpkins For Doodle Slutty Halloween - why Can't Women Just Wear Normal Fancy Dress?
