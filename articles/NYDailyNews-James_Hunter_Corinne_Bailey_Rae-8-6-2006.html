                <p>to 8 N r.O 'iii ? :J c( ~ '0 c: :J Vl MUSIC 'A merican Idol" winner Taylor HiCks has been shouting about the "soul patrol" ever since he first popped up on television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in the ne,q few weeks, a range of acts will bring some bona fide R&amp;B and soul music to Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legendary singer Candi Staton presents her quietly powerful singing at the Bow­ ery Ballroom (6 Delancey St., 212-533-2111) this Wednesday, Aug. 9, hot on the heels of her acclaimed comeback album, "His Hands." -Boz Scaggs will head a terrific double bill at Town Hall (123 W. 43rd St., 212-840-2824) on Aug. 15 with British soul singer James Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scaggs is still glowing.from the acclaim for his jazz standards CD, "But Beautiful," and he's in great voice and sure to include older hits, in­ cludingthe many classics ("Geor­ gia," "Lido Shuffle," "What Can I Say") from his 1976 masterpiece, "Silk Degrees." Hunter is a journeyman ",-nUl soul singer in the style of Sam Cooke who has suddenly bro­ ken through with his third CD, "People Gouna Talk." It's the first that's been successful enough for Hunter to hopefully stop working his day jobs for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; B o. z Scaggs isjust startin~to dig deep­ .er.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 62-year-&lt;lld singer has had . every type of success ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a kid, he took his guitar and sang for his supper I've tried to use some of the things I've taken on in doing that music in everything I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Learning to Sing all over again, am I." That album of standards, "But Beau­ tiful" ($18.98, Gray Cat records), was a revelation, with Scaggs lightly swinging classics like "What's New" and "Sophisti­ cated Lady." It's success has him singing better than ever, as heard on the double­ CD set "Greatest Hits Live" ($18.98, Gray Cat) and the first U.S. release of the .' Japanese import "Fade Into Light." What they all have in common are classic songs -whether the standards of Duke Elliryg­ ton or Scaggs' own hits from his four de-­ cades in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Corinne Bailey Rae tops it all off with a triumphant return to the city at Webster Hall (125 E. 11th St., 212-353-1600) on Aug. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The young Rae's delightful first album is one of the year's big success stories, debuting at No.1 in the U.K. and enjoying word of moutl~ in the States that's kept it hovering in the Top 20. on the streets of London and Bombay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dressed to the nines, he went to San fran­ cisco during the 'Summer of Love (people thought he was a narc) and sang on the first two albums of the Steve Miller Band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a sol6 artist, his mellow soul broke through on the multiplatinum 1976 smash "Silk Degrees." But only now does the acclaimed vocalist feel he's really master­ ing his craft "Believe it or not,l do feel like I'mjust starting to get the hang of singing," says Scaggs. "After doing the album of stan­ dards, I felt like I was just starting all over. "If the so-ngs have any merit at all, they, can be revisited," says Scaggs, who proll)is-' es another album of standards soon.'" Md· personally, I like revisiting those songs;"; _;,s;ms. ------------------------------ ------------------------ --------. • 11 her riling things up there as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If going shopping.'" Don't try and lell Candi Staton what she can sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Alabama­ born soul singer, who performs at the Bowery Ballroom on Wednes­ day, has been pushing boundaries her entire career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She began In the world of gospel by perfonmlng with ..

But her alcotlolism found Staton hitting rock bottom, and she turned to the chureh In the '80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staton's been recording gospel music for the past 20 Yea rs and a new two-CD set, 'The Ultimate Gospel Collection' - (Shanachie), out Aug. 22, shows Ray Charles brought gospel sound Like Tina Turner's comeback al- to the secular world, Staton brought bum "Private Dancer: Staton's funk music back to the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And- new album is crafted to reflect her now she's delivered her first album life, including everything from a cov- of soul music in more than 20 years er of Merle Haggard's "You Don't with the critically acclaimed "His Have Far to Go" to the heartbreak- Hands" (Astralwerks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not everyone ing title tune "His Hands," where the will approve. hanDS switch from those of a lover '1 have to do what I have to do, • to those of an abusive husband and says Staton, 66. whose New York ultimately those of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was writ- concert will be her first here In more -ten by British performer Will Oldham, than 20 years_ aka Bonnie Prince BIlly, spec meally 'When people say, 'I don't sing for Staton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are some cheatin' secular music: I say rig!lt away, 'Do songs trom the old days she won'l you sing "Happy 8irthday'?

"I was having breakfast in his hotel with Morrison," says the 43-year-old Hunter about the days just after he started touring with the singer. "He mentioned he was going to a tailor'S to be kitted out with a tuxedo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Immediately, I piped up and said, 'Hey, how about getting us them as well?' He turned to his manager and said, 'What do you think about th l'!pO we all trooped off, and Morrison got us all II fot like penguins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five of us and Morrison II·glggllng in this tailor's shop because it was a c~rlence for all-of us." i{a \I1e classic soul singers he admires, Hunt­ "iliues to dress nattily for his gigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His third People Gonna Talk" (Rounder), is the first stribuled in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listen to his smooth n cuts like "Mollena" and" All Through Cr- d you'd swear you were listening to some cd gem from the early Sixties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surely no s songs this classic, this good, anymore? ave a girlfriend now; she hasn't upset me ghs Hunter.

"Since last November, every· thing has gone so steadily," says the 27-year-old Rae, chatting in an upper West Side hotel room af· ter a day of press (and shopping at the Barneys New York Co-Op). "It's been weird and good -but quite spooky, like it's this path you're just walking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's been really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As opposed to playing in a pub, carrying your amp down the stairs, getting the gui­ tars on the bus, getting record com­ panies to watch the band and they don't like this person or want that to change." Hardly a surprise, since the CD is so engaging, ranging from the acoustic soul of "Like a Star" to more jazzy terrain, only to trump it all with a Stevie Wonder-like finale, "Season's Change. " Now Rae hopes to fioat to the top of the U.S. charts as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's performing at Webster Hall on Aug. 23, her latest return visit to Manhat­ tan where an earl ier gig had her delivering a wicked cover of Led Zeppelin just to keep fans on their toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A full-page feature in Billboard described the biggest fear oftle'r record company: that Rae may be becoming too successful too fast; they want her popularity to grow more gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No'-such-Iuck. ., ~----- -- - - - - --- - ---- ----------------- ----- - - ------ - -_ .. ----- - - - - - ------ - -- - -- - - - - - ----- - ---- - -----:.:.......--..:.~..,.--'""~ --'I' ...
