Huh, Ithought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quick check of IMDB.com showed what happened: the reporter probably just glanced at the number of credits under "director" in Spielberg's entry and considered their work done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact,under "director" IMDB includes episodes of old TV shows, video games, home movies he made as akid (Spielberg is a wunderkind but he certainly didn't direct his first feature film at 13), upcomingprojects that may or may not happen and even uncredited work on the opening segments of a 1984TV miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a lot more accurate to say Spielberg has directed more than 25 movies,depending on how you count a segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie and TV films released theatrically overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in any case, you can shout out, "You're wrong!" and feel justified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even inentertainment news, there are such things as facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA Today made a similar mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In covering the vampire novels of Stephenie Meyers, they compared the 8 million copies of her books sold to the "28 million" copies of Harry Potter books in print in the US by JK Rowling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? That was the print edition and now online they've quietly changed it to "140 million copies" of Harry Potter books in print in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, unlike a movie review or a debate over whether Barack Obama is presumptuous by taking an overseas trip that John McCain previously blasted him for NOT taking, there's no question about the facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

An opinion is an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I for one prefer the British miniseries to both the new feature film AND thenovel it's based on. (I enjoy Evelyn Waugh but much prefer his nasty satires like Scoop and Decline and Fall and the racist but funny Black Mischief to the more staid Brideshead Revisited .) All you can do is read a review you disagree with and hope to find some whopper of an error or an opinion so out of whack it undermines what they are claiming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This review came close with oneoffhand reference to the fact that Brideshead Revisited was only a moderate success in the UK when it first aired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really? The DVD extras vaguely refer to the miniseries being a "smash" hit inthe UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But then they also refer to the theme song hitting the Top 10 of the pop charts when it onlyreached #48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quick call to the British Film Institute found no firm evidence either way though alook at some of the weekly TV charts when the miniseries first aired seem to indicate the Timesmight be right about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then comes an opinion so clearly wrong, I felt another "gotcha" coming on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writes the New York Times : "It is worth considering that "Brideshead Revisited" appeared during -- to borrow a phrase of Waugh's -- the "dead years" of television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-form narrative had yet to wield its powerfulinfluence on the medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1982 American viewers had a choice between the sensuousexploration of love, fidelity and money that "Brideshead" provided and "The Facts of Life" (or"One Day at a Time" or "T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hooker")." Frankly, this is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might argue the jiggle years of the mid 70s were a low point forbroadcast TV, thanks to hits like Charlie's Angels and Three's Company .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in fact, the end of the 70s and the early 80s were unquestionably a high point of quality television only matched bytoday. (And we need 100+ channels to equal what they accomplished with three -- and PBS.) On TV in the late 70s and early 80s was Hill Street Blues , arguably the most influential and important TV show of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was far from alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could also watch St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elsewhere, Fame, Little House on The Prairie (quite a good show in the early years), The Paper Chase, RockfordFiles, Lou Grant (dated but acclaimed at the time), Rumpole of the Bailey and the groundbreaking Cagney &amp; Lacey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sitcoms! The sitcoms of that era leave the current poor crop in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; M*A*S*H had seen better days, but it was still M*A*S*H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's Barney Miller, Taxi, Cheers, Buffalo Bill, Newhart, Soap, Fawlty Towers, and the equally brief but equally brilliantPolice Squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why compare Brideshead Revisited to a sitcom like The Facts of Life ? Perhaps because the late 70s and early 80s was a highpoint for the miniseries the likes of which we may never see again -- yet another reason why arguing that Brideshead only looked decent because everything around it was dreck is foolish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other miniseries from the late 70s and early 80s include Alec Guinness's remarkably subtle work in Tinker Tailor Solder Spy and Smiley's People, plus Shogun, Holocaust, The Duchess of Duke St (from the people behind the landmark Upstairs Downstairs of the early 70s), Masada, Nicholas Nickleby, Reilly Ace of Spies and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throw in TV movies and you're looking at The Day After, Special Bulletin, The Bunker, A Woman Called Golda, Something About Amelia, Bill (w Mickey Rooney), Gideon's Trumpet w Henry Fonda, Guyana Tragedy w Powers Boothe, Friendly Fire and Playing For Time w Vanessa Redgrave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now does that really sound like an era best exemplified by The Facts of Life, One Day at a Time and TJ Hooker? In fact, you have to willfully ignore the best and the brightest of the era, the most acclaimed shows and many top hits in order to pretend that 1982 was a bleak time for television.Besides, I love my twee, languid, oh so pretty miniseries Brideshead Revisited almost as much as I love Hill Street Blues, Cheers, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and the other brilliant TV of the late 70s and early 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...

Even the sillystuff back then had better talent than what they put out there now with all of the reality shows populatedby clueless (but self-promoting) wannabes and C List "celebrities".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hung in there with TV through the 90s but I have given it up for the most part now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still prefer British programming (excellent mystery/crime series, hilarious and truly edgy comedies and sophisticated drama) and tend to purchase series from Amazon UK on DVD or watch things online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps I am missing something on American TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am certainly completely ignorant of what is on currently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, much as I enjoyed the TV shows of my youth, I don't feel like I am missing out muchlately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And, to the poster above...thanks for reminding me of Anthony Andrews!

(And of course the first fewPrime Suspects are the best crime movies of all.) As for Anthony Andrews, he's beenpopping up on some of those UK shows like Miss Marple, Rosemary &amp;Thyme and the like. lwaxanatroi See Profile I'm a Fan of lwaxanatroi permalink See, the Times is coming from that oh so superior "I don't really watch television" mentality instead ofthe "i love television; there's so much good writing on it" mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I teach creative fiction writing and I tell my students there's an advanced level writing class on their TVs every night of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course I believe you can also learn from bad writing, but the truth is that TV scriptwriters have to produce stories that are strong enough to keep viewers from channel surfing and they have to do it within strict time limit-- except, of course, for Brideshead, which went on for at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still remember dissolving in tears at a closing shot of Sebastian played by Anthony Andrews, then the handsomestman in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a shot of Sebastian numb-drunk and staring into space and you realized thatall his bright promise was fading and would never come to anything because of his alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So howanyone put this monument of a story into a two-hour movie I have yet to fathom, but please pleasedon't listen to the TV hating Times and go rent the thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Thanks for the props for television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn't agree with you more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I too get the feeling the TVcritics for the NYT don't really watch or enjoy a lot of tv, even though there's an abundance ofsolid TV worth watching, if only for a time. (3 seasons of Gilmore Girls, 2 of BattlestarGalactica, 4 of West Wing and so on).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only shows knew when to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUt that's antotherstory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anthony Andrews was indeed the prettiest man on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QueenCeleste See Profile I'm a Fan of QueenCeleste permalink The brilliant Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and its hilarious spinoff starring Martin Mull, Fernwood2Night, come to mind, as well as the drama Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PBS's Masterpiece Theatre had one extraordinaryseries after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I plan to see Brideshead Revisited this weekend, reviews be damned! Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink My friend just saw the Brideshead remake and enjoyed so hopefully you will too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the miniseries Brideshead was shown in the UK in 1981 and in the US in 1982, I limited myself toshows that aired from 1979 to 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I didn't include Mary Hartman or the 1977 spin-offFernwood2Nite (or Mary Tyler Moore, the greatest sitcom of all time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wonder if Family wouldhold up well (I haven't watched season one on DVD yet).I loved it at the time but think it willprobably be very earnest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you can never go wrong with Masterpiece Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eric8869 See Profile I'm a Fan of Eric8869 permalink I totally agree with the inappropriateness of the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 70's had some of the best televisionever - all those Normal Lear TV series about social issues no one would address in a sitcom today.Can you imagine a major sitcom about a racist being the number one comedy series now?
