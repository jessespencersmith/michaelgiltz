An avid reader of fantasy literature, Novik is also a history buff with a particularinterest in the Napoleonic era and afondness for the work of Patrick O‚ÄôBrian and Jane Austen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She lives in New York City with her family and six computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: July 10, 2018 Publisher: Del Rey Pages: 480 ISBN 10: 0399180982 ISBN 13: 9780399180989Personalize / Add More Choices What We Say She's done it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naomi Novik launched her career with the delightful conceit of combining the Napoleonic era with dragons...talking, thinking, querulous dragons who sometimes wonder why they don't have the same rights as humans, or atleast the same respect that dragons enjoy in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the sort of musing that might make any human riding on their backs a little...nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Temeraire series began as a paperback-only release but garnered excellent reviews and a growing legion of fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten books were planned but, just after the eighth, Novik delivered a stand-alone fantasy novel called"Uprooted." Digging deep into Polish folklore, it was remarkable and took Novik to an entirely new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Temeraireseries ended (rather abruptly, to me) with the ninth and final volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a very good and sometimes great series, butNovik was stretching her own wings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here comes "Spinning Silver." Nominally inspired by the tale of Rumplestiltskin, it too is a stand-alone novel every bit as good as "Uprooted" and sure to be just as successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our heroine is Miryem, the Jewish daughter of a moneylender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her father isn't a very good moneylender; he's rather embarrassed to ask people to payup and takes any excuse with good cheer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So naturally people put him off as long as possible or simply never pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theyoung girl loves him and doesn't mind so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when her mother becomes ill and their genteel poverty threatens to kill the mom and leave them homeless, she becomes rather determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miryem finds the fortitude to confront the people who owe them money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her persistence and perhaps their mild feelings of shame result in her becoming a very good moneylenderindeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly, the family isn't just surviving; they are flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miryem unthinkingly boasts that she can spin silver intogold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's when the real problems begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like "Uprooted," this book is bursting with characters that are bitingly alive-- real, complicated, confounding and delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even when they surprise, you think well of course that's what they would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a while, the book alternates between Miryem and a servant named Wanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You assume this is the pattern of the book, when suddenly another character takes over the narrative for a chapter: the daughter of a nobleman who looks set tobe married off in desultory fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then another and another voice is added: the little brother of Wanda, theunexpected husband of that soon-to-be-wed daughter and more, each of them captivating and distinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novik does not create some imaginary fantasy world with an elaborate set of rules, Toklein style. (Though she does give a fire demon a very Tolkein-esque name.) No, Novik sets her story in the folk tale world of our youth, but one that is far more realisticand rich than any you'll find in Grimm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with "Uprooted," you won't discover a battle between good and evil but a battlebetween people and mythic characters, all of whom have their motivations and fears and desires, making the idea of "heroes" and "villains" seem positively childish by the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winter battles with spring, two worlds existing side by side try to swallow each other up and it's all gripping and funny and so, so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one stage almost smack in the middle of thenarrative, Novik brings together two storylines in a way I hadn't expected and it made me smile with delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That wasn'tthe first or the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any book with a terrific opening, a mic drop closing and not a faltering moment in between is tobe cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But beyond that, Novik is enriching the world of fantasy and folk tales with a depth of emotional complexity, empathy and humanity not seen since the heyday of Ursula K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Le Guin, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's spinning silver into gold, indeed. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúA book as cool and mysterious as a winter‚Äôs night, with two marvelous heroines at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spinning Silver pits the cold of endless winter against the fires of duty, love, and sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn‚Äôt put it down.‚Äù ‚ÄîKatherine Arden, New York Times bestselling author of The Bear and the Nightingale ‚ÄúNaomi Novik knows how to weave words into magic, and Spinning Silver enchants the reader from the first page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This magnificent tale of three courageous young women who find the power to change their fates will catch you in its spell and linger long after the last chapter is read.‚Äù ‚ÄîChristina Henry, nationally bestselling author of The Mermaid What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
