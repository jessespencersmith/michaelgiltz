What if Deep Throat went on camera and made his case to the world? That's the exciting promiseof the new movie Citizenfour by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Laura Poitras.Poitras of course was approached by whistleblower Edward Snowden (along with journalist Glenn Greenwald)about sharing a cache of classified documents that revealed wholesale spying on the American people and itsallies, uncovered direct lies made by government officials to Congress and ended Snowden's life as he knew itforever.Poitras and Greenwald collaborated and made the most of the unprecedented leak, delivering revelation afterrevelation that ultimately led to a Pulitzer Prize for The Guardian and The Washington Post, as well asinvestigations both by Congress and other governments around the world.At the same time, Poitras was filming their initial meetings with Snowden in Hong Kong, not to mention thenewsrooms as Greenwald and other journalists tensely filed their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was hilarious to see them get readyto deliver the embarrassing revelation that the US government had eavesdropped in on the private cell phone ofGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're waiting for a possible comment by Merkel via some spokespersonbefore printing the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Snowden asks by text, why not just call her directly?The result of this behind-the-scenes documentary is a compelling story that serves both as a primer on thescandal and a profile of Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the very least, it might inspire an entire new generation of young people totake up investigative journalism just like Watergate and the movie All The President's Men did nearly 40 yearsago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's usually no money in it, people will denounce you as a traitor and you'll be wary of entering orleaving the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But gosh does it look like fun.Here's the trailer for the film.The heart of the film are the hotel room scenes with Snowden in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is truly fascinating to observehim up close after he'd made his fateful decision but before the world -- or even his longtime girlfriend -- knewabout it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's funny but unnerving to see Snowden's knowledgable paranoia over how easily they can be trackeddown electronically. (He unplugs the room phone because it's a VOIP phone, he drapes a sheet over his headwhen on a laptop so no glimpse of their surroundings can be captured by the built-in camera and they all get alittle freaked out when a fire alarm goes off inexplicably.)For the first time, we get to see and hear from Snowden in depth, calmly and thoughtfully explaining why he didwhat he did and how he hopes to keep the story from becoming about him rather than the massive violation ofthe Constitution and lack of oversight in the intelligence community he was helping expose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's smart, calm,wry, self-possessed and elucidates issues with clarity.12/16/2015New York Film Festival 2014 #5: Edward Snowden Documentary Citizenfour Debuts | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=91c67188-8592-4173-a109-3a199b2e4f11&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/4The discussion he and Greenwald have about if and when Snowden would reveal his identity (Are they doingthe government's job for it? Will it be more powerful if he steps forward rather than waiting to be exposed?) iscompelling and a perfect example of the competing interests they were juggling all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the stories beginto hit the papers and the intensity mounts, watching Snowden transform from an unknown guy in his 20s whofelt these actions needed to be exposed into a hunted man whose face is suddenly beamed all over the worldbrings home how his privacy is gone forever.Poitras and her editors deliver all this and more in a taut 114 minutes, including the increasing surveillance ofthe journalists, the sort of thing that they've dealt with long before they met Snowden. (Poitras is invariablypulled aside and harassed at length every time she enters or leaves the country.)The film begins tellingly with a depiction of how an anonymous Snowden first reached out to Poitras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leadsto regular albeit encrypted online communication and finally that face to face meeting in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then slowlyand remarkably, their communication is cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Snowden becomes a man without a country, forced to leaveHong Kong and ultimately stranded in Russia, not exactly the first place a person who values personal freedomwould choose to reside. (The Obama administration made certain countries like Venezuela and Iceland wouldnot provide him a haven safe from extradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE TO SELF: make sure you're already in the country youwant to spend the rest of your life in before unmasking your identity in a leaks scandal.)Direct meetings with Snowden and his allies became phone calls and then they are back once again toencrypted texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point while underground, Snowden said it was too risky to film himself via camera asPoitras had asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was even afraid to speak out loud for fear it would attract the authorities and endangerhis hosts.That loss of a visual record leaves a hole in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a vivid reminder of the loss of privacy all citizensface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As computer security expert Jacob Appelbaum notes during a forum covered in the movie, when peoplesay that privacy is dead, what they mean by privacy is liberty and freedom; this shouldn't be an acceptable stateof affairs, he insists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end, Snowden is seen from outside his home in Russia, joined by his girlfriend butkept distant and cut off from the world in so many ways.Contacts with Greenwald and Poitras are surely a lifeline and the movie ends with a great kicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenwaldand Snowden discuss a new whistleblower who has come forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenwald avoids stating certain crucialdetails out loud or on camera (surely Snowden's home is bugged, for one thing) and he scribbles this and thattelling bit of info on paper for Snowden to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They discuss safety measures and some of the data this newleaker is sharing, including a revelation that Germany's denials about its level of involvement in the US dronesprogram are lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another bombshell: the US government has more than 1.2 million American citizens onvarious levels of a watch list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Snowden helpfully puts that number into immediate context: that's more than thepopulation of some entire countries.Later, Snowden's eyes widen as Greenwald flashes more words he's been scribbling down on that piece ofpaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then of course, Greenwald rips it up and presumably Snowden burns them to ashes later.The idea that more will follow in Snowden's wake -- people who have knowledge of illegal and unconstitutionalactions by the government stepping forward in a sober and responsible manner -- is surely sustaining toSnowden. (Those who tried to raise similar issues before Snowden through proper channels were repeatedlymuffled and gagged and vilified, discredited before they could take their case public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence the action he took.)But the final emotion the film leaves you with is not elation but unease and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music of Nine InchNails underscores numerous passages and the journalists involved surely hope you'll wonder: while you'rewatching this film, who's watching you?Here's the TED talk Glenn Greenwald delivered on privacy at the TEDGlobal 2014 conference Tuesday,October 7.</p>
