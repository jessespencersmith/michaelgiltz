Nope, and that's where the poignancy lies -- Hair is obsessed with the war and the draft and worries itself sick over the fate of the charmingly innocent Claude (an impressive Jonathan Groff), a goofball who pretends to be from Manchester, England but knows he's about to be dragged into the army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, people don't take to the streets to protest the war because there is no draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are also no flag-covered caskets or dead bodies -- they're kept out of sight by a shameful and smart Bush administration, which makes the tableau at the end of this show all the more shocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wars produce young dead people? You wouldn't know it from watching the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the theatrical questions remain: is Hair a good musical and should it transfer to Broadway? The first act is fairly brisk and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Songs like "Sodomy" and "Black Boys" (from act two) have lost their shock value but they're still amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each tune gives a new hippie a chance to shineand the cast makes the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the center of it all are Claude and Berger (played by a very fitWill Swenson).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berger is -- how to put this? -- kind of a dick, treating most everyone around him Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

His breakthrough in Spring Awakening was clearly only the beginning for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Swenson has charisma to burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If only the finale were braver: if Swenson and the other hippies actually had to DEAL with the fact that Claude was joining the military instead of just ignore it, the show would gain even more dramatic weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sidestepping that emotional moment (will the hippies condemn Claude or embrace him?) was perhaps too risky for an era when people confused the soldiers with the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But for all those caveats, Hair has two big numbers that sweep away all objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The opener, "Aquarius," is given a magestic reading by Patina Ranea Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She strides across the grass and the hippies clamber over the walls and come up through the ground like children following the PiedPiper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the finale is the irresistible "Let The Sun Shine In." You see a dead soldier lying on aflag and the Tribe sings its plaintive, simple request and you think, "Why not? That's not asking somuch, is it?" And they slip offstage into the darkness and you can hear their voices softly comingup from beneath the seats and it's quiet and dark and sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then they come back out, burst intothe song again and invite the audience to jump onstage and dance with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If any show earns theright for a crowd-pleasing gesture like this one, it's surely Hair in Central Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Broadway, I think you'd feel like a tourist gawking at a reenactment from the past, like those colonial villages.But here, under the stars, with a bunch of sexy, talented actors, Hair can win over the most cynical, if only for a song or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What other critics are saying:Ben Brantley of The New York Times said, ""Hair" registers as an eloquent requiem not only for the idealism of one generation but also for the evanescence of youth itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's still the "tribal love- rock" celebration it was always advertised as being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in suggesting the dawning age of Aquarius is already destined for nightfall, this production establishes the show as more than a vivacious period piece. "Hair," it seems, has deeper roots than anyone remembered." Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News gives it 3 1/2 stars out of 5 and said the show certainly has aged and lost its power to shock but "Good tunes are timeless, however, and despite afew duds, "Hair" is filled with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until the end of August, it's the coolest place in the city to letdown your hair." Frank Scheck of the New York Post gives it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and said,"The rousing revival that opened last night at the Delacorte - 40 years after it first played the Public Theater - feels as fresh now as it did then, thanks to the sheer energy of its sexy young ensemble." David Rooney of Variety said the director "embraces the organic, free-flowing feel and spontaneous atmosphere of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Making extensive use of the aisles to connect actors andaudience, she creates something akin to a happening in the park that honors the spirit of themusical and the liberating time in which it was conceived while subtly identifying its ongoingrelevance." But he worries about heading to Broadway: "A transfer of this production remains adistinct possibility, but welcome as that prospect is, it's hard to imagine the same thrill beneath aproscenium as the one being generated under the night sky in Central Park." Brian Scott Lpton of Theatermania.com said, "But tackling this often tricky, often joyous, and occasionally heartbreaking piece of theater four decades after its Off-Broadway debut comes complete with an obstacle course of directorial challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fortunately, Diane Paulus overcomes "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...
