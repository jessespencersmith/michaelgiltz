(I immediately started wondering what song would be good for Crystal.) Even better, they're going to makethe playlists of songs that the contestants choose from available on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This gives the fans a lot moreto think about. iTunes lists 50 songs that the Top 12 can choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assuming these are the only songs they get to select from, we have a much better insight into the options they're given and how smart they are in their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then the Top 12 was slowly announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige Miles and Katelyn Epperly faced off, with a resigned Katelyn going home and Paige heaving a huge sigh of relief (as I predicted).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Todrick Hall and Lee Dewyzefaced off, with Todrick still sporting the fingerless gloves that probably spelled his doom. (Todrick alsogave a strong goodbye performance; he just needs a stylist.) Alex Lambert and Andrew Garcia faced off and Alex was devastated by being sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was genuinely heartbroken, frustrated that he didn't have the confidence to show his talent to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was followed by a dueling pianos rendition of Billy Joel's "Tell Her About It" (one of my favorite songs of his) by last season's Scott McIntyre and Matt Giraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After it was over, I wondered which one would be going home. (My pick would have been Scott.)Finally Katie and Lilly faced off and Lilly was sent home, to the astonishment of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So now we know the Top 12 and the playlist of 50 Rolling Stones songs they get to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's your chance to help your favorites on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Which song would you recommend they sing (and how, if you think they need to give it a new arrangement).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ROLLING STONE PLAYLIST Angie As Tears Go By Beast of Burden Black Limousine Brown Sugar Can't You Hear Me Knocking Country Honk Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker) Emotional Rescue Fool to Cry Get Off My Cloud Gimme Shelter Happy Hang Fire Heart of Stone Honky Tonk Women Hot Stuff It's All Over Now It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It) Jumpin' Jack Flash Lady Jane The Last Time Let It Bleed Live With Me Love In Vain Midnight Rambler Miss You Mother's Little Helper 19th Nervous Breakdown No Expectations Paint It, Black Play With Fire Ruby Tuesday Salt of the Earth (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Shattered She Was Hot She's a Rainbow She's So Cold Shine a Light 1 of 5 Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Tester Tester Pushes to Reform Senate Rules With Greater Transparency, Efficiency Steve Ballmer My Keynote Address at the 2011 International Consumer Electronics ShowDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 9 jennifer connelly baby bump jersey shore natalie portman pregnant raven symone weight loss rebecca budig More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Dropped From New York Radio Station, TV Ratings Fall Like 6K Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drew Pinsky: How Lindsay Lohan Can Stay Sober READ MORE Camille Grammer: Kelsey Made Me Do Real Housewives READ MORE Rihanna to Launch Her First Fragrance READ MORE John Legend Parties WithPauly D, 'Precious' John Edwards Proposes to Mistress Already?

I'd hate for him to get his hands on Crystal and wreck her like he did Bo Bice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Absolutely .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let it Bleed would be great for Crystal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if she got away with singing "You can come all over me" it would be the funniest thing since Andrew Garcia's "I'm a genie in a bottle/You gotta rub me the right way." Ah ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew? Heads up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one watching wants to rub you the right way, the wrong way, or any way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bet no one sings Let It Blleed Or Start Me Up for those very reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You make a dead man come?

Crystal Bowersox, Michael Lynch, Siobhan Magnus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are the songs I would like to see them do:Crystal -- Tumbling Dice Michael -- Emotional RescueSiobhan -- Can't You Hear Me Knocking I bet though Siobhan will opt for Gimme Shelter (read: Mary Clayton, "It's just a shot away ...") so she can cater to the judges' infantile request for another "moment" like she had with the big screamin the Aretha Franklin song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wish they would shut up and just let the girl sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're gonna ruin itfor all of us by trying to groom her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think she's the most dynamic and interestin g singer in the competitio n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spelling correction : MERRY Clayton sang on "Gimme Shelter." No biggie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They got it wrong on the original album notes, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didi could do an indi version of "Wild Horses" like the Indigo Girls did once at a concert I attended.There's also another female artist that has done it recently (not Susan Boyle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll be interested to see what Crystal does - she is suited to this genre - hope she changes it up aFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Permalink | Share it DCDan 02:35 PM on 3/14/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:44 AM on 3/17/2010 Permalink | Share it DCDan 11:12 PM on 3/13/2010 Permalink | Share it DCDan 02:30 PM on 3/14/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:45 AM on 3/17/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER mlrlmsw 10:45 PM on 3/13/2010 8 Fans 317 Fans 66 Fans 59 Fans 114 Fans 59 Fansbit. "satisfact ion" for Lee "Wild horses " for Michael "Angie" for Casey (keep to the original version)I like Andrew but can't figure out what Stones song he would sound good doing, Same goes for thewomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I see the rumors about Ellen having the lighting changed and softened was true, she looked less ghostly, but still really added nothing to the show for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOVED it when Simon said that Kara'scomment about the song having to relate to the singers life was "Rubbish".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder all of Kara'ssongs are about breaking up with a boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a weird liminted provincial view she has ofmusic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd be embarrasse d if I were one of the judges or producers of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bobby Sherman's performanc e of Hallelujah was so horrid and shallow I thought he'd be mugged instead of hugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then again, I do Not find Ellen "adorable" as a judge of music or singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I find her way more annoying than Paula ever was- and she was useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This past show was a wakeup call- tit's all a big joke- anyone can lose, anyone can win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whose records are you gonna buy- if any? Simon's leaving, so this is my last season watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's moreaggravatin g now than entertaini ng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then again- the only thing watching on TV on New Years Eve is Kathy Griffin- certainly no music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truthfully , I'd rather watch Guy Lombardo than the Black Eyes Peas or Carrie Underwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he's Way before my time! Bobby Sherman! That was funny and spot-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've been seeing outrage all over the place (such as Entertainm ent Weekly) and I have to ask...why? I really appreciate people who can sing well or have a unique sound and I just did notget the whole Alex Lambert thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had an ok voice but especially the other night, I just didn't buyit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He didn't connect to what he was singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm surprised more people haven't picked up on the complete double standards the judges have for the men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katie and Aaron are both young singers with older voices and presences.Aaron gets commended for singing songs that are arguable too old for him and does not get thetalking down that Katie received every week about "singing her age" and "appearing young".Permalink | Share it Binea 03:39 PM on 3/13/2010 Permalink | Share it CAMBEL 10:33 AM on 3/13/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER auramac 11:38 PM on 3/12/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:46 AM on 3/17/2010 Permalink | Share it courtb 06:21 PM on 3/12/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:48 AM on 3/17/201043 Fans 2 Fans 8 Fans 2 FansI think Aaron got grief for that too, such as when he sang "I'm Already There." With his country vibe, I think it's just that Aaron sort of knows better what works for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They'redefinitely struggling with Katie, but I don't think it's because she's a girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Alex and Lilly deserved Top 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both had a chance to go further into the program than eitherAndrew or Katie - neither of whom will win American Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex has a unique voice - a soulful voice,if you will, for such a young guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's hope a record producer will recognize that and develop thiskid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He needs guidance and seasoning - and I hope he doesn't give up any aspiration s for becoming a profession al singer and recording artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To better understand "American Idol" and how it works I ask the following question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOBBY SHERMAN or JIM CROCE? WHICH ONE WOULD ADVANCE FURTHER ON "AMERICAN IDOL?" (Now of course I'm assuming you're old enough to remember who Bobby Sherman and Jim Croce were and so I'll skip describing who these men were and what they were as performers ) So who would win?...... ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously it would be Bobby Sherman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I know, I know, Jim Croce had more talent, was a better artist, and Dawg never sounded pitchy inhis life! But the Jim Croce's of the world are not what "American Idol" is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never has been and never will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Idol is about the Bobby Sherman's of the world, and I'm not writing this to be cynical or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We may not admit it, but we all have a place in our collective hearts and souls for a Bobby Sherman and the type of entertainm ent that he represents .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's why the Lilly Scott's of the world never quite make it and why someone like Paige Miles andher wholesome good-looks and image just might beat out someone like Crystal Bowersox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IS IT FAIR? Well, it is only entertainm ent so one shouldn't really take it all seriously in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or in other words; Easy come, easy go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sad ,but true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon should consider doing a show that would find and expose talent like Jim Croce or Roger Hodgson,Dy lan and so on...not just assembly line music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They could do the American Idol type interviews and auditions, but the contestant s must all audition with a song they themselves wrote.Ther e should be no age limit, just anyone over 16 and unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each week they would have to come on with a new song they have written,wh ich at that point could have some help from good and establishe d song writers and musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a show I could watch without having to make the excuse " My kids make me watch itwith them" :)Permalink | Share it Charity 06:12 PM on 3/12/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 04:35 PM on 3/12/2010 Permalink | Share it Binea 11:48 AM on 3/13/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 12:29 PM on 3/13/201059 Fans 59 Fans 0 Fans 59 Fans 3 FansAnd if you had a show which catered to the Jim Croce's and the Bob Dylan's of the world I guarantee you it would be a snooze-fes t........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those prison shows on MSNBC would get higher ratings than watching some guy sing a song he wroteabout his time in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All You might try Nashville Star if you like country music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is no age limit andthey perform at least one original song, which is often the week that cements awinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I definitely agree that a lot of artists wouldn't do well on Idol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, for those that do,Idol is a great platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I haven't seen Bobby Sherman talk too much so no idea how hedoes on camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim Croce I have even less impression of as a personalit y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bob Dylan for example was a handsome devil, very quick-witt ed and has a wide appreciati on for all sorts of genres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Idol were on in the Sixties, he would have done great, gritted his teethduring the obligatory album deal and then gone off on his own to fame and fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is definitely a travesty since the voters didn't vote that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The producers chose this, they areallowed to ignore the voters as they make sure to disclaimer in the credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theres far too much atstake, its a number one show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The advertisin g revenue comes first and the producers needed a Top 12 that would target as many advertisin g demographi cs as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tim, There is little to no chance the show rigs the results and ignores the votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mainreason? There's no point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drama of who the viewers do and don't pick is far moreexciting than any choices they could make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the producers were picking, Adam Lambertwould have won last year, the chubby Ruben Studdard would never have won Season Twoover dorky but lovable Clay Aiken and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disclaimer refers to their reasonableability to eliminate computeriz ed voting or any voting via phone and text they decide violates reasonable understand ing of what should be allowed That's to more accurately reflect the voting of fans, not to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hundred computers with software shouldn't beable to decide the winner; that's all they want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think if next week we hear Andrew does another acoustic rendition of something (probably a songoriginally sung by a girl) American will know they've made a grave mistake, lets hope he surprisesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OMG what a travesty!! ! Alex Lambert really had the most unique voice with real potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Lilly who came as a surprise to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't believe it but I think it wasn't a surprise to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He had some of the lowest online fan base which goes to show why people who lets be honest don't stillbelong there like Tim Urban and sadly also Andrew Garcia who have a ridiculous ly huge fan base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same with Lily who just didn't have much of an online presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:49 AM on 3/17/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 04:52 AM on 3/17/2010 Permalink | Share it timverhaegen 01:18 PM on 3/12/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 02:06 PM on 3/12/2010 Permalink | Share it Namanh Hoang 01:03 AM on 3/12/2010Goes to show people should have been more active in spreading the world online to support their favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one to blame but yourselves .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies done by Baduku show that Baduku and Twitter fan base have been the most accurate when it comes to defining the top 12. http://www .baduku.co m/american idol9 FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Permalink | Share it</p>
