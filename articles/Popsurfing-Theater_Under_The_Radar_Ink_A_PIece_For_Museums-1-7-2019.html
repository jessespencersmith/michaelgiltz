A sort of Ted Talk for tapestries and the like? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, how many people are out there who can hold a stage, speak authoritatively andentertainingly about art and art history, weave in personal anecdotes, compose beautiful music, play multiple instruments and dance with insouciance? Heck, I'm not even sure James can dance with insouciance, so it takes two here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Ink , the combination of their talents has created an engaging piece that surely will be welcome atmuseums around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their show is broken into five parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jerome Ellis kicks things off with the story of a sabbatical he took away from his friend and collaborative partner James Harrison Monaco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inspired by a book, Jerome decidesto make his own ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before you know it, we're off into the history of ink and calligraphy and illuminated manuscripts, scored by music one or both of them perform throughout and backed by projections ofvarious art pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it is a story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jerome has a stutter and explains how early on in their friendship he asked James to introduce Jerome to others, saving him the hurdle of repeating his own name. "James gave me my nameback hundreds of times over the last ten years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like that,they set a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A close but playful examination of a signature of Suleiman the Magnificent flows into some hypnotic music which leads to more personal comments (such as how the two bonded by spending endless days at the Met soaking in their favorite works together) backMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (7) ► February (1) ▼ January (6)to music (maybe with Jerome soloing on the flute or sax) and back to art history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it an art lecture? A performance piece? A musical concert? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photo copyright by Marcus Middleton Jerome's stutter adds an element of drama to the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the audience realizes he is not "performing" but simply working to communicate with them, they are immediately on his side, rooting forhis thoughtful comments and compelling voice to come as easily as hewants, while patiently making mental room when it doesn't. (Anyonewho has seen the British performance artist and comic Daniel Kitson will recognize this phenomenon.) James becomes a helpful counterpoint, contrasting their styles of storytelling and giving bothJerome and the audience a breather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This only adds to the sense ofwarmth between them and the people hearing their story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is good since Ink would otherwise lack tension and be merely a lecture with modest anecdotes woven in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No natural suspense arises from the stories shared or information presented, however compellingthey might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, their comments are illustrated throughout with images of art. (Media Designer Shawn Duan is the third key element of theshow, which was directed by Rachel Tavkin and Annie Tippe.) FromPart II onward, each piece of art projected on the screen was spoken about directly or obviously related somehow to the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not so inPart I, where Jerome set up his story and their friendship while seemingly random objects were displayed behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Undoubtedlythey have significance, but that remained obscure at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A similar disconnect seemed to reoccur with the last few images of the show, though that was so minor it just be my fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The visuals andBookFilter Reading List THEATER: "Choir Boy" -- It's The Same Old Song THEATER: "Ink" -- The Art of Calligraphy, Performa...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: UNCLE VANYA; VANYA -- MY UNCLE; UNCLE IVA...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movies, Books, Theater, Concerts, CDs I've See...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: It's Alive!

I've no idea butone thing is clear: James wasn't being "dismissed." But the way thattransition was voiced added a discordant note; it should be handleddifferently in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just as clearly, this piece will indeed have a future at any museum James &amp; Jerome want to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only pity is that those future audience members won't be able to follow the show by immediatelyheading upstairs at the Met to check out most of the key piecesmentioned in person with a new appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the creator of BookFilter, a book lover’s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a website that lets you browse for books online the way you do in a physical bookstore, provides comprehensive info on new releases every week in every category and offers passionate personal recommendations every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He’s also the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day with top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POSTED BY MICHAEL GILTZ AT 1:26 PM NO COMMENTS: Post a Comment Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)</p>
