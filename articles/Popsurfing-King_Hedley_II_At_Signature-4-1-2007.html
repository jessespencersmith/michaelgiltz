                <p>S U N D AY, A P R I L 0 1 , 2 0 0 7"King Hedley II" At SignatureSometimes critics get cheated by having to see a show early in its run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alot of shows get much better AFTER they've been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw acritics' performance of Sondheim's "Passion" that was remarkable butweighted heavily towards the role played by Donna Murphy. (One ofthe four main characters had just replaced another actor.) I saw theshow again right before it closed and the change was amazing -- a showI had loved before was much, much better with the entire cast fullyintegrated into the story, without any sense of one person dominatingthe tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murphy was still brilliant, but the show was much better withthe others matching her blow for blow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And so to "King Hedley II." It'sthe third August Wilson play revived by Signature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw "Two TrainsRunning" and "Seven Guitars" and both productions were very, verygood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong ensembles all around and of course Wilson's plays aregreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only Wilson I'd seen before this season at Signature was"Jitney" off Broadway, so I was eager to jump into his ten-play cycle."King Hedley II" was a mess on Broadway from all I've heard, withBrian Stokes Mitchell (wonderful in "Kiss Me Kate") simply wrong forthe role of King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This revival got nice reviews, with everyone feeling theplay was rambling but frequently magnetic and the ensemble verygood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That doesn't go nearly far enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's not the critics' fault.I'm sure these actors are getting better performance after performance.Wilson's work is rich and demanding and the more they do it, the morethey cohere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the critics came back and reviewed the show I sawtonight, I'm sure they would RAVE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King is brimming with rage andrighteous (but it is rarely a righteous rage), his best friend Mister is afamiliar character without being a type and the genial hustler Elmore(the terrific Stephen McKinley Henderson) is endearingly cleverenough to know he might just have a few moments of happiness left inhim but old and wise enough to know the odds are still long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peopletalk and talk and talk in Wilson's plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when a cast like this isdoing the talking, it couldn't be more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signature hasn'tannounced its next season yet, but they're on a roll -- I pray they keeptackling Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Give us "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" and "Fences" and"The Piano Lesson." And I'm debating whether to go back to "KingHedley II" again before it closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was that good.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 12:46 AM Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "King Hedley II" At Signaturehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/04/king-hedley-ii-at-signat... 1 of 37/25/09 12:44 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SBiboyMichael in New YorkAaron POPSURFING.COM: "King Hedley II" At Signaturehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/04/king-hedley-ii-at-signat... 2 of 37/25/09 12:44 PMPOPSURFING.COM: "King Hedley II" At Signaturehttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/04/king-hedley-ii-at-signat... 3 of 37/25/09 12:44 PM</p>
