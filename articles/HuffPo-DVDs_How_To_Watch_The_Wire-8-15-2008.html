Ifyou're a fan of intelligent, hard-hitting dramaswith complex storylines and compellingcharacters, you simply must take the time towatch The Wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Murder She Wrote is as complex a TV drama as you like to deal with.Maybe you found Friday Night Lights a bit too raw and 7th Heaven is more your speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you've been absorbed by The Sopranos or Hill Street Blues or NYPD Blue or The Shield or Deadwood , you need to watch The Wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It truly is one of the best TV dramas of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you knew that -- you've seen the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are a few pointers for diving into this and really anydrama available on DVD. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wait til the current season is over -- The Wire has shut down for good, so you have the great pleasure of sitting down to watch Season One, knowing exactly how many seasons the show will run and that they're all waiting for you as soon as you're ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is like glancing ahead to see how many pages a novel is before you begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reading a 210 page novel is very different from reading an 874 page tome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wire includes 60 episodes made over 5 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I understand playing catch-up, diving into a series like Battlestar Galactica mid-run so you can see what the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's always good to have every extant episode available at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Someshows annoyingly wait till right before the new season begins before releasing the previous season on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the UK, they smartly put a season out on DVD as soon as it's over. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep your finger on the subtitle button -- if you avoided The Wire during its initial run or on HBO's On Demand service, you get one very helpful bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When watching an episode on DVD, you can call up the English subtitles displaying the dialogue when one of the characters mumblestheir line or uses slang you can't parse out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On almost every episode, there's usually at least oneline that remains a puzzle no matter how many times you rewind (I'm not up on Baltimore streetslang) and that button sure comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The thug Snoop is an especially indelible character, Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Like this story?

Upstairs Downstairs? The West Wing? Star Trek: The Next Generation? The X-Files? Tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: South Park Complete Eleventh Season ($49.99; Paramount) -- It's a day for superlatives, but believe me when I say that South Park is not simply the best animated show on TV (sorry, Simpsons ), but it's the best sitcom on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Office? 30 Rock? Flight of the Conchords? Entourage? Not even close to the incredibly high standards maintained in the 14 episodes contained here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throw in the wicked social commentary, endearing (yes, ENDEARING) characters like Butters and the most hilariously closeted character in TV history (I mean you, Cartman) and aseries that began as sort of a goof, with really only the shock value of tykes cursing in the earlyyears has gotten better and better and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Start watching in season seven or eight and beamazed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or start right here, with episodes about the "n" word, gay reperative therapy, the three-part adventure to Imaginationland, the homeless, giant bowel movements (hey, I didn't say theygot wildly sophisticated), a Guitar Hero parody and a not-so-heartwarming Easter special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If youwant an Emmys scandal, I say it's the fact that South Park has never been nominated for Best Comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brand Upon The Brain! ($39.95; Criterion) -- Guy Maddin is truly one of the most singular talents working in film today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's obsessed with silent movie techniques but no retro-fanatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact his films are ground-breakingly modern and inventive that don't so much push against genreconventions as expand them with polymorphous pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This silent, black and white sci-finightmare set in a lighthouse during his childhood (see?) is a wonderful companion piece toMaddin's current theatrical mood piece My Winnipeg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is like absolutely no one else and howmany filmmakers can you say that about? Also out is a two-movie collection of Larisa Shepitko --Eclipse Series 11 containing Wings and The Ascent ($29.95; Eclipse), a celebration of a Russian director I'm perfectly clueless about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But how can you resist a 1966 movie about a female fighterpilot reliving her glory days during WW II but now a headmistress at a school? Documentaries -- Among the flood of movies and documentaries about surfing, Bra Boys ($29.99; Berkela) stands out with its story of the Abberton brothers, four lads tangled up in murder and heroin and violence and poverty who only feel free on the waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Narrated by RussellCrowe and sure to be a fictional film any day now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Muhammad Ali: Made In Miami ($19.99; PBS), a fine 60 minute documentary that finds a new angle on Ali by focusing on Miami where he foughtSonny Liston, met the Beatles, befriended Malcolm X and refused to fight in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jane "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

(And if they covered the Grateful Dead or even Phish I could die happy.) Superheroes: The Filmation Adventures ($24.98; Warner Bros.) is an 18 episode collection featuring The Flash, Aquaman, The Atom, Hawkman, Teen Titans, the Justice League of America and others in various combinations fighting evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These sort of pairings are a lot easier to swallow in animation than they would be in a live action movie, which is why the live action Justice League movie is such a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tom and Jerry Tales Volume Five ($14.98; Warner Bros.) is 12 episodes of Tom trying and inevitably failing to outwit Jerry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV Roundup -- The American Mall ($24.99; Paramount) is MTV's so-so attempt to catch up with the Disney Channel when it comes to music-oriented programming...and how weird does that sound? The literate Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard is seen in 9 TV mysteries in the PD James Essential Collection ($149.98; Koch).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dave's World Season One ($44.99; Paramount) is the sort of routine, amiable but forgettable sitcom that TV relies on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caroline In The City Season One ($44.99; Paramount) on the other hand was a would-be sophisticated comedy starring the capableLea Thompson and theatrical star Malcolm Gets that bounced around for four years with modestsuccess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Glittering Prizes ($39.98; BBC) is the UK miniseries about Cambridge students that helped make Tom Conti a star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Lawrence 1st Amendment Stand-Up Season Two ($29.97;Anchor Bay) offers 12 episodes from the Starz channel comedy showcase featuring Rodman,Donnell Rawlings and Sheryl Underwood among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Racing Game ($39.99; Acorn( is a six episode miniseries based on the Dick Francis mystery set in the horsing world and isn't it a mysterythat there's never been a really good movie based on one of his many bestsellers? The AntonChekhov Collection ($59.98; BBC) contains nine Chekhov plays performed on the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Chekhov is so hard to get right (really, he's almost always better to read than see performed), thatdespite casts that include everyone from the great Gambon to Eileen Atkins, there are many moremisses than hits here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excellent extras include three radio plays and Ewan McGregor reading aclutch of Chekhov short stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Movies Roundup -- The Art of War II: Betrayal ($24.96; Sony) isn't the best Wesley Snipes vehicle but he could use the money and you know you always wanted to simply not pay your taxes too so help him out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Killing Of John Lennon ($19.95; IFC) is the other John Lennon movie,this one starring Jonas Ball as the disturbed Mark David Chapman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people should not readThe Catcher In The Rye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Outlaw and His Wife ($29.95; Kino) is the 1918 silent classic by Swedish master Victor Sjostrom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's paired with a documentary on him and there's also anotherDVD with two more of his movies ( A Man There Was and Ingeborg Holm ) but this is the place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Belly 2: Millionaire Boyz Club ($26.98; Lionsgate) is a weak sequel starring The Game to the gangsta flick Belly that glorified pimping and dealing but was at least energetically directed by Hype Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a testament to how crushed with movies the multiplexes are that so many filmscan fall through the cracks -- even an "indie" film like Smart People ($29.99; Miramax), which can boast of Sarah Jessica Parker, Dennis Quaid, Ellen Page of Juno and Thomas Haden Church can simply disappear as if it were never released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God help the indie film that doesn't have big name stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Legend of the Shadowless Sword ($19.98; New Line) is Korea's not-as-successful answer to the masterpiece Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but it does have two strikingly lovelyfemale leads and a nifty underwater fight scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And kudos to New Line for making a digital copyof the film available to purchasers who might want to watch the film on another device; everystudio should do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marianne Faithfull continues her singular career by playing a frumpyhousewife turned sex worker (and not just any sex worker but "the best right hand in London") inIrina Palm ($27.99; Strand).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apparently, hand jobs can be empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joy House ($24.98; Koch) is a 1964 bit of crime fluff starring Alain Delon and a young Jane Fonda, both looking absurdlypretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who's prettier? It just depends on your taste; my bisexual friends call it a draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm quiteunfamiliar with Polish director Lech Majewski but Kino has released a batch of his major works,including the autoiographical opera of sorts The Roe's Room, the even more surreal Glass Lips and the perhaps marginally more mainstream romance The Garden Of Earthly Delights ($29.95 each title; Kino), which is where I'm going to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, even the packaging for grindhouse classicHollywood Chainsaw Hookers: 20th Anniversary Edition ($14.98; Retromedia) makes me laugh Cars Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Bank Of America War Wire Video Financial Crisis MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...
