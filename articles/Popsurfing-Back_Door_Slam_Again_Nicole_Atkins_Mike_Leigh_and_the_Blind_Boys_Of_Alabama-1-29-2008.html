                <p>T U E S D AY, J A N U A RY 2 9 , 2 0 0 8Back Door Slam (Again), Nicole Atkins, MikeLeigh and the Blind Boys Of AlabamaA quick update on my outings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saw Back Door Slam again at theMecury Lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lads were smashing, as always ("Thank you verymuch indeed!") with a few new tunes mixed in, including a cover of theRobert Cray song that gave them their name. (I still prefer my take ontheir name - the Back Door Slam is the sound of kids running out toplay in the summertime.) And word of mouth is tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firsttime I saw them, there were maybe 15 to 20 people, the next time 30+,the next time even more and this show was crowded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not quite soldout, but close, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, touring still works!Then saw Nicole Atkins at the Bowery Ballroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Have to admit, when Ifirst heard about the show, I assumed she was opening up for someone.Nicole herself said it was "the weirdes" day of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strong crowdand she joked that she didn't even recognize everyone. (That's whenyou know you're getting somewhere, when the audience isn't just filledup with family and friends.) She has a great voice and is a realperformer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few of the songs are weak, but she barrels through themand had some great covers: the Doors' "Crystal Ship" and a raucoussing-along with the opening acts finale on Fleetwood Mac's "TheChain." Every indication she'll just get better.Then on Saturday I saw Mike Leigh's new play "2000 Years." Notterribly involving and it certainly didn't help that New York actors weretrying to nail London accents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without that specifity of location (itmight as well have been East Orange, New Jersey), the play losessomething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still I doubt an all British cast would have lifted it up toomuch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seemed to be about a middle aged couple whose son becomesinterested in praying and his Jewish roots much to the chagrin andmocking humor of his parents and sister and grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there'salso the mother's sister who is mysteriously out of touch for 11 years (orseven!) who naturally reapears in Act Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A very good melt downscene of family squabbling gave a little late momentum and I sort ofliked the ending, which I didn't see as terribly optimistic as some did.Glad to have seen it and the grandfather (Merwin Goldsmith) wasoutstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glad I saw it but not one of Leigh's stronger efforts.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Back Door Slam (Again), Nicole Atkins,...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2008/01/back-door-slam-again-n... 1 of 37/25/09 2:30 AMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (15)▼ July (2)Swimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (6)► 2008 (87)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SMichael in New YorkBiboyAaron POPSURFING.COM: Back Door Slam (Again), Nicole Atkins,...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2008/01/back-door-slam-again-n... 2 of 37/25/09 2:30 AMPOPSURFING.COM: Back Door Slam (Again), Nicole Atkins,...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2008/01/back-door-slam-again-n... 3 of 37/25/09 2:30 AM</p>
