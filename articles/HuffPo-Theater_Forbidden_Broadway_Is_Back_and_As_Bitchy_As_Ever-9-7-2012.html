I should have seen that!" (No, Ihaven't seen the revival either , though I imagine Forbidden Broadway had fun with that beloved musical playing at the Snapple Theatre.) Happily, after hearing about it for all these years, Forbidden Broadway: Alive &amp; Kicking is exactly what I expected: it takes wicked shots at some shows, highlights the foibles of actors who can't sing, bemoans the commercialization of Broadway, offers up amusing impersonations of famed stars but darn it, no matter how hard they try to be mean-spirited, their love of theater and the frustrating, egotistical, talented, wonderful people who put it on shines through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The ratio of hits to misses is strong and the overall creativity solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It never became off the charts funny (except for a few moments) but it was never dull either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't need to have seen the shows to enjoy the parodies; indeed, as I'm certain many critics have said before, going to see Forbidden Broadway is probably a lot more fun than most of the new shows that come and go each season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alessandrini wrote everything and directed alongside Phillip George.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Caldwell (the talent behind the promising musical Gotta Getta Girl ) is back behind the piano as musical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes by Philip Heckman and wigs by Bobbie Cliffton Zlotnik are inventive on a dime (and maybethe cast is all alone backstage, but if someone is helping them quick change from one outfit to the next, they are probably the hardest working person there).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All four cast members are game and genial, but it must be said that the women outshine the men throughout and Jenny Lee Stern shines brightest (though Natalie Charle Ellis came on strong in the second act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most Broadway performers can probably enjoy the gentle and not-so-gentle ribbing of ForbiddenBroadway but I doubt the vocally challenged Elena Roger of Evita will be stopping by anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stern is hilarious here, though the target is such a slam dunk (Roger literally couldn't sing her role and seemed to disappear even when onstage for minutes at a time) that Alessandrini couldn't have missed with this one if he tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder it's the first dart tossed; knowing that the tune "Buenos Aires" repeats over and over that Evita has "star quality" (the very thing Roger lacks) makes this almost tooeasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what puts it over is Stern's hilarious enunciation of every lyric, though Marcus Stevens sets the tone for the guys by being an amiable but soft-focused Ricky Martin, goofy a la most improv but notquite dead-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He does better teasing Matthew Broderick for barely being able to dance in a musical (back surgery didn't help) and here Marcus does a terrific vocal zinger on Broderick's speaking voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spoof on Annie called Granny doesn't really land (okay, so it's a 35 year old musical; so what?), but like every other number here, it's put over with energy and is soon over: more than 20 shows (and a TV show) get spoofed here in under two hours (including an intermission) so in the tradition of the BorschtBelt, if you don't like a joke, just wait a minute and another one will be along soon to take its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mocking of the serious Once (my favorite musical of last year) was fun, with star Steve Kazee's singing another example of finding an actor's quirk and exploiting it for amusement; it's a highlight of Scott Richard Foster's night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was followed by Ellis and her broad vocal range used to marvelous effect in "Feed The 'Burbs," a naughty spin on Mary Poppins and the tourist trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellis was even better in another highlight, the full-on hilarious sketch surrounding Porgy &amp; Bess (I mean, The Gershwin's Porgy &amp; Bess ), with Ellis spot-on doing Audra McDonald both vocally and as an actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were lulls too: the finale involved The Book Of Mormon but I don't think Alessandrini cracked that code yet; the South Park guys clearly mock themselves along with everyone else and the idea that they disdain Broadway and its traditions doesn't fly (especially since one of the songs the show spoofs -- "I Believe" -- is itself a loving send-up of "I Have Confidence" from The Sound Of Music ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But no matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The evening is fun and breezy and the temptation to return in six months or a year and see what they're teasing next is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Especially if Jenny Lee Stern is still in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She does an hilarious Patti LuPone (alongside Stevens as Mandy Patinkin), nails The Jersey Boys, Bernadette Peters and pretty much everyone else in her path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saturday Night Live should jump on her talents right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
