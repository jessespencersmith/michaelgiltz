It may stumble just a tad at the finale, but that doesn't prevent me from recognizing these are some greatand vivid characters I won't soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It starts simply, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our heroine is Eva, a practical young girl of the1930s (practically the only practical one in her family, as it turns out).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her mom takes Eva to first the child's fatherwhen his wife dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? Turns out Eva's mom is the other woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before you know it, the little girl has beendumped on her dad's doorstep, introduced to the half-sister she never knew she had and watching her mom's cartake off for parts unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather blithe about the whole event, Eva's dad is trumped by her determined sister Iris.The two of them scrimp and save money (the hard part is not earning money but keeping it away from their larcenousfather) and then abscond to Hollywood, where Iris is set (not unreasonably) on becoming a movie star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sapphicromance and vicious gossip columnists shatter that dream and the family reunites as servants to the nouveau richeon the east coast, with their dad transforming from a philandering teacher into a surprisingly effective butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And on itgoes with dizzying speed, from World War II and sultry jazz singers to doomed romances and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A side storyabout Americans of German descent being repatriated to Germany doesn't quite hold the attention -- though it has apurpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is at times a wickedly amusing and always page-turning tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iris and Eva and their unflappablefather are three indelible characters. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Lucky Us is a remarkable accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One waits a long time for a novel of this scope and dimension, repletewith surgically drawn characters, a mix of comedy and tragedy that borders on the miraculous, and sentences thatshould be in a sentence museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amy Bloom is a treasure.”—Michael Cunningham“These two things about Amy Bloom’s surprise-filled Lucky Us are indisputable: It opens with a terrific hook andcloses with an image of exquisite resolution. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She writes sharp, sparsely beautiful scenes that excitingly defyexpectation, and part of the pleasure of reading her is simply keeping up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won’t know where Lucky Us isheaded until, suddenly, it’s there. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book’s opening lines, destined to be quoted in many a classroom for theirperfection, are: ‘My father’s wife died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My mother said we should drive down to his place and see what might be in itfor us.’ . . . [It’s] a short, vibrant book about all kinds of people creating all kinds of serial, improvisatory lives.Changes occur because characters fall in and out of love, trouble and, yes, luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even when the bad luck isdevastating, they dust themselves off and inventively…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....12/1/2015BookFilter | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=fbb1c4d5-fd9a-4bb6-be5a-9ea5b3b4ffdb&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;4/4Published:July 29, 2014Publisher:Random HousePages:256ISBN 10:1400067243ISBN 13:9781400067244</p>
