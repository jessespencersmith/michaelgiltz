(Both also excelled on the stage, which Fonda was especially devoted to his entire career.) Exceptionally private men, loners even, they were also the best of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This amiable new biography tells the story of their lives through the prism of that friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hank and Jim were a classic odd couple: Stewart sort of fell into acting and Fonda knew it was his calling from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart had onewife his entire life; Fonda was married five times (though they both were crazy about Margaret Sullavan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart wasdeeply religious; Fonda was agnostic, at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stewart was a rock-ribbed Republican; Fonda was liberal (though not as liberal as his daughter Jane).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only serious fight they ever had was over the Communist witch hunt in Hollywood; the result was that they simply never discussed politics again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they had a lot more in common: they crossed paths incollege, roomed together in New York City when they were struggling actors, roomed again in Hollywood when they weremovie stars, built model airplanes, crafted elaborate practical jokes on friends and just plain enjoyed each other's company-- the less talking the better, as far as these two remote, honorable men were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Author Scott Eyman spoke to everyone he could and did his homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's doubtful anyone who has read other biographies of them will learn much here but Eyman tells the story with compassion, albeit without blinders. (Neither man is very cuddly, whatever their screenpersonas.) No great insight into their films is offered, though the back and forth between their careers adds a little zip tofamiliar stories about screen successes like "Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roberts" and "Winchester '73," as well as projects that got away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An early version of Larry McMurtry's "Lonesome Dove" was a screenplay and set to star Fonda, Stewart and John Wayne till the latter pulled out -- and those two alone weren't enough to get the film made! Stewart was angling to film "On Golden Pond" untilJane Fonda won the battle for movie rights. (She in turn ignored Peter Fonda's request to be director.) Yes, film buffs likeme can't help savoring even well-worn stories like these along with a few new tidbits. "Hank and Jim" quietly makes thecase that their friendship showed these two giant talents at their best, even when at times the burden of fame and old age didn't. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “We love Hank Fonda and Jimmy Stewart already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were beloved actors in a beloved age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So putting them either side of an ampersand seems natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what Scott Eyman does is to say, well, pay attention – these were two difficult, lonely, inarticulate guys who could seem alarming and chilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they were friends and Eyman has told their story like a movie, with humor, pathos and enchantment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not two biopics hitchedtogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a love story for guys who never mentioned or even noticed love.” - David Thomson, author of The Biographical Dictionary of Film and Warner Bros: The Story of an American Movie Studio "Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart were two of the most brilliant stars of Hollywood’s golden age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were also the best of friends, despite marked differences in their approach to life, love, family and politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott Eyman,one of our finest film historians, presents an intimate, powerful and bittersweet account of these gifted,complex and troubled men and the world they knew and dominated." - Glenn Frankel, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author of High Noon: The Hollywood Blacklist and the Making of an American Classic “Scott Eyman has a gift for exploring subjects we think we know, then deepening and enriching that knowledge through diligent research and his gift of observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This book is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henry Fonda and James Stewarthave never been captured so well, nor has their extraordinary fifty-year friendship.” - Leonard Maltin “In his engrossing new book, biographer and film historian Eyman vividly portrays the lives and work of twoHollywood legends. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While their long-standing friendship is notable, in tracing their personal lives andaccomplishments, Eyman's narrative is even more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He provides a fascinating overview of the industry and the ebbs and flows of his subjects' careers in film, on stage, and eventually TV . . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An entertaining, richly documented biography that will be appreciated by film and theater scholars as well as fans of these memorableactors.” - Kirkus Reviews "With the same grace, intimacy, nuance, and thoughtfulness with which he brought John Wayne alive on thepage, Scott Eyman conjures the greatness and humanity of two Hollywood giants and the magic spell of theirfriendship." - Patrick McGilligan, author of Young Orson: The Years of Luck and Genius on the Path to Citizen Kane "I had no idea Fonda and Stewart even knew each other, and now I learn two of America's greatest actors were also the greatest of friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's gratifying when a gifted writer finds a worthy subject, and Scott Eyman has with Hank and Jim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You have to think both men would have loved the book—although Fonda probably wouldn't have admitted it." - Daniel de Visé, author of Andy &amp; Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show "If you've ever wondered how the Greatest Generation got so great, it was due in part to the respect political opposites like Stewart and Fonda had for one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, you could say it's a love story in the tradition of Howard Hawks, intimate, knowing, and compulsively readable." - James Curtis, author of Spencer Tracy: A Biography What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
