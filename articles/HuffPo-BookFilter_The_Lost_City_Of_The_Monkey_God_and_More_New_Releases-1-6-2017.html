Looking back over the one hundred books I finished in 2016, I realized only two books earned a perfect four stars out of four from me. (I'm a tough grader; be glad I'm not your teacher.) One was Evicted by Matthew Desmond, a terrific work of narrative nonfiction about how housing and poverty are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You saw it on a lot of best of the year lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other was a reissue of a classic-but-forgotten mystery -- Black Wings Has My Angel by Elliot Chaze, the tale of a sucker who gets hooked up with a dangerous gal when planning the perfect crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What could possibly go wrong? What were your favorite reads of the year and why? Email us at newsletter@bookfilter.com and we'll share some of your choices in a future column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because the next best thing to reading a great book is sharing it with others. *************** SELECTION DAY by Aravind Adiga In this new novel by the Booker Prize-winning author, the character of Mohan Kumar is obsessed with the desire for upward mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So he has forsaken a rural peasant life and taken his two sons, Radha and Manju, talented cricket players, to a slum on the outskirts of Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There he dreams of turning them into champions of the game and overcoming the humiliation of his life as a chutney salesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the most psychotic version of the stage mother, or soccer mom, or little league dad that I have ever come across, Mohan is....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Fiction? Discover More Here! Love Sports? Discover More Here! *************** MRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHERLOCK HOLMES by Brad Ricca Ever heard of Grace Humiston? In the early 1900s, she was one of the most famous women in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Humiston was the first female District Attorney in the US, a crusader against horrific working conditions down South and a defender of immigrants and the poor in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in 1917, Humiston made headlines around the world when she cracked a cold case involving a missing young woman, bringing the killer to justice and showing the NYPD to be incompetent or corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The press dubbed her "Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherlock Holmes" and this new memoir tells the story of that infamous....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Biography? Discover More Here! Love Mystery? Discover More Here! Love History? Discover More Here! ***************HOW TO HYGGE by Signe Johansen OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First things first: it's hygge as in hoo-guh. "Hoo" as in "June" and "guh" as in, um, "guh." Anyway, hygge is a trendy term in the US but a way of life in Danish society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's like the idea of cocooning, but without any high tech binge-watching of TV in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Think home-made candles, good friends, delicious treats and a toasty fire, preferably made with logs you chopped down yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, hygge is a very do-it-yourself, hand-crafted approach to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's shared experiences over personal possession, friends not "contacts"....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Home &amp; Garden &amp; Crafts? Discover More Here! Love Self-Help? Discover More Here! *************** THE MISTRESS by Danielle Steel Danielle Steel has gone all James Patterson on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, she's not suddenly loaning her name to books mostly written by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she has dramatically sped up her output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of one or two books a year, she's creating a book practically every other month! Fans don't seem to mind and they're sure to embrace this timely tale of a desperately poor (but beautiful!) young Russian woman named Natasha who becomes the plaything of a powerful oligarch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She relishes the security of his money and power, remaining perfectly loyal and mostly content...until a handsome young artist named Theo Luca comes into her life....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Romance?

J.R.R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892 and if nothing else he was responsible for my favorite Christmas gift ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One summer in the 1970s, a neighborhood mom pushed me to read "The Hobbit." I came back two days later for her copy of "The Fellowship Of Ring" and two days after that for "The Two Towers" and two days after THAT for "The Return Of The King." I was never much of a re-reader and so it didn't occur to me to even ask for my own copies as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, my mom casually picked up a boxed set of all four paperbacks (for a grand total of maybe $8 at the time?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Christmas morning my parents were thrilled to present a much-needed ten speed bike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was about as necessary as socks...and just as exciting to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But "The Lord Of The Rings?!?!" I hadn't expected that yet it was exactly what I wanted and I couldn't wait to dive in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When my dad realized I'd already read the books, his jaw dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why the heck would I want a copy of a book I'd already read? I felt bad but it really was the best present I ever got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I devoured them again that Christmas and every Christmas for the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tolkien's grandson Simon has a novel set during WWI due out January 24 and Tolkien's tale of "Beren &amp; Lúthien" comes out in a new edition this May...just in time for my birthday. (Yes, mom, that's a hint.) *************** WHAT DOESN'T KILL US by Scott Carney So do you want to keep that New Year's resolution about getting into shape? Or do you want to laugh at such a puny goal and become an extreme sports enthusiast with Iron Tribe and other boot camp style programs? In this new work combining the latest science and a personal desire to push himself to the limit, author Scott Carney explores the newest science on what the human body can endure, profiles gurus like Wim Hof and takes his own plunge into extreme fitness, culminating in an attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro wearing only running shorts and sneakers....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Sports? Discover More Here! Love Health &amp; Fitness? Discover More Here! *************** LOVE AND FIRST SIGHT by Josh Sundquist YouTube star Josh Sundquist has a huge online following thanks to being a Paralympic ski racer, surviving cancer, writing a best-selling memoir, touring the country as a motivational speaker and now becoming a debut novelist. "Love And First Sight" is the story of a blind high school student who discovers that suddenly being able to see at first creates a lot more problems than it solves, starting with a girlfriend that doesn't look anything like he's been told....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Young Adult?
