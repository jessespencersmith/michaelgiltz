The witty, sparkling, screwball comedy-worthy banter from theshow's glory years was merely a front to keep loneliness at bay? Whatwere Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn? Manic depressives?Lorelai was desperately lonely and had a freakish dependence on herdaughter? I don't know what show Heffernan was watching, but itwasn't "Gilmore Girls." I didn't see a woman who was desperatelylonely because she didn't have a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw a smart, intelligent, funnywoman who had raised a terrific kid as a single mom and excelled inbusiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She was open to the possibility of romance but she wasn'tsitting around waiting for a knight in shining armor.And who says she was lonely? Both Lorelai and Rory were part of awarm, vibrant community -- surrounded by friends and coworkers andindeed an entire town that loved and respected them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lorelai hadissues with her mother and the show (initially, at least) slowly drewthem back together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And her relationship with her daughter wasn'tco-dependant; it was delightful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you described a man who wassupremely witty and fun and sexy, who raised a kid on his own (and agreat kid, at that) and was running a successful business and poised tolaunch a business of his own, he would be described in one word: acatch.Typically, the NYT probably got it wrong -- the way they did withNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: "Gilmore Girls" On The Brink...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/gilmore-girls-on-brink.html 1 of 37/28/09 3:04 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SAaronBiboyMichael in New York POPSURFING.COM: "Gilmore Girls" On The Brink...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/gilmore-girls-on-brink.html 2 of 37/28/09 3:04 PMPOPSURFING.COM: "Gilmore Girls" On The Brink...http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2006/11/gilmore-girls-on-brink.html 3 of 37/28/09 3:04 PM</p>
