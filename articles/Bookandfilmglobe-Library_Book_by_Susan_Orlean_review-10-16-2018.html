                <p>Saturday, February 16, 2019  NON-FICTION Check Out ‘The Library Book’ Susan Orlean’s Long-Overdue Celebration Of The Public Library  October 16, 2018 Michael Giltz Author Susan Orlean has enjoyed extraordinary critical and popular success with books like The Orchid Thief and Rin Tin Tin , her biography of Hollywood’s four-legged star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heck, Meryl Streep even played her in a movie ! And yet, she was done with writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orlean simply didn’t have interest in devoting years and years of her life just to produce one more book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she went to the library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving to Los Angeles andtaking her son for his first visit to their new branchbrought on a Proustian rush of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Orlean wasoverwhelmed by images from her own childhood whenshe and her mom shared visits to the library as a belovedritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The L.A. library was new to her but it immediatelyfelt like home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That prompted Orlean to take a private guided tour (theNot actually Susan Orleanprivileges of fame) and that led to her becoming more and more excited by this almost invisible institution we take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, legendary documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman has been focusing on institutions in America like hospitals and schools and zoos for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even he only got around to the library in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Orlean’s guide mentioned the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fire, what fire? THE fire, he responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On April 29, 1986 the Los Angeles Central Library went up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It damaged or destroyed more than one million books and provedthe worst library fire in US history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was ruled as arson but no one was ever found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reason Orlean–and perhaps most people outside Los Angeles–have never heard of the fire? Well, it happened the same week asthe Chernobyl nuclear meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The end of a library vs. the end of the world? Well, the media focused on theend of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Orlean has focused on the fire…and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Library Book does about two dozen things, all of them well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It covers the fire and its aftermath in fascinating detail, including the gay would-be actor who claimed to be the arsonist but proved such an inveterate liar he would drive friends and enemies alike to drink.It tells the history of the L.A. library system, including sketches of early head librarians from redoubtablewomen like Telsa Kesslo (who dared to go outdoors without a hat; scandalous!) to the colorful, unqualified butgenerally significant Charles Lummis, who made national news by walking from Ohio to L.A. in 1885.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The list goes on: How libraries work, the purpose of libraries, their changing role from a warehouse of books to a community center and source of information and services, the history of women as librarians, the latest onarson investigations, the life of that actor Harry Peak, all of it juggled masterfully in an unfolding narrative thatnever flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s the sort of book for which you’ll gladly pay an overdue fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon &amp; Schuster(October 16, 2018) Tags: Frederick Wiseman , libraries , Library Book , Rin Tin Tin , Susan Orlean , The Orchid Thief← The Return Of ‘Harvey Birdman’ Lives Of Loud Desperation → A Nation of Greater Fools?  November 3, 1999 Bob Mould FuckingRules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And So Does His Memoir.  June 25, 2011 A Charming, Frequently Hilarious Memoir  January 16, 2013 Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for many outlets, such as New York Post,New York Daily News, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Huffington Post, PremiereMagazine, Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's co-host of the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox. You May Also Like Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required fields are marked *Comment Name * Email * WebsiteSubscribe to our mailing list Social Twitter Facebook Recent Posts The Eyes Don’t Have It The Kids are Not All Right Nasty, Brutish, and Short ‘Isn’t It Romantic?’ 31 Days of Oscar–Week Three Recent Comments Delores Sundbye on The New York Times Sends an Assassin to Kill Leonard Cohen Sharyn on Apocalypse Zhao Self-publishing News: Indies at the Movies | Alliance of Independent Authors: Self-Publishing Advice Center on Apocalypse ZhaoCasey on Apocalypse Zhao hng23 on The New York Times Sends an Assassin to Kill Leonard CohenArchives February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018May 2017 February 2016 May 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014March 2014 December 2013 September 2013 April 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012July 2012 November 2011 September 2011 June 2011 May 2011 March 2011 May 2001March 2001 October 2000 August 2000 July 2000 June 2000 February 2000 January 2000 December 1999 November 1999October 1999 September 1999 August 1999 July 1999 June 1999 May 1999 April 1999March 1999 February 1999 September 1998 June 1998 May 1998 April 1998 February 1998October 1997 September 1997 August 1997 June 1997 May 1997 April 1997 March 1997February 1997January 1997 November 1996 September 1996 August 1996 June 1996 May 1996 April 1996 February 1996 January 1996October 1995 August 1995 February 1995 January 1995Copyright © 2019, Book and Film GlobeAbout Us | Terms &amp; Conditions | Privacy Policy | Advertise with us | CONTACT INFO EDITOR – Neal Pollack – neal@bookandfilmglobe.com GENERAL MANAGER/ADVERTISING – Kevin Sanders – ksanders@seaofreedsllc.com – 201-724-0340 VISIT OUR SUITE OF SITES</p>
