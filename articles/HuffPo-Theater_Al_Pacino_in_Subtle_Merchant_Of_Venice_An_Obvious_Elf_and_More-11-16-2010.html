(Dead center inside the fenced off area is a stock ticker.) Back and forth, guards keep opening the fence to let in decent men MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 BIG NEWS: Rihanna | Mila Kunis | Movies | Gwyneth Paltrow | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Democratic Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot, Federal Judge Killed At Public Event Suspected Arizona Shooter Identified: Disturbing YouTube Videos, MySpace Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her Should The Leader Of The Free World Dress Like THIS?

Not a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The marvelous set is just one element in the most thoughtful, balanced production of The Merchant Of Venice I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an ugly play and this show doesn't shy away from that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Invariably, it hinges on the performer playing Shylock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How Jewish will he be? How assimilated? Will the show be afraid of hisrevenge or revel in it? If the show is too timid, Shylock doesn't register and the show has no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More often, the actor playing Shylock chews up everything in sight and when he leaves the stage it petersout to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Al Pacino is unabashedly Jewish; no fitting in for this man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he also keeps the performance reined in and at the service of the play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You never doubt the ugliness of the anti-Semitism that embitters Shylock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you never doubt that he wants his pound of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in this production by Daniel Sullivan, the play does not tilt towards Shylock or these prejudicial issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It seems, above all, to be about the untrustworthiness of men, especially lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Bassanio (a solid David Harbour) pleads unfairly with his friend Antonio (the easily pliable Byron Jennings) to front his deeply in debt friend even more money so Bassanio can woo Portia, the youngerman gently massages Antonio's neck, knowing Antonio's love for him and playing on it easily, thoughalmost without thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's not trying to rook Antonio; Bassanio just wants what he wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Jessica (Heather Lind) runs off with the callow and comely youth Lorenzo (Seth Numrich in his fine Broadway debut), it doesn't take long for reality to set in about her romantic lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just hours after they've eloped he seems petulant, yanking his hand away from hers when she tries to hold it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when Bassiano and Gratiano (a lively Jesse L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin) break their vows to their lovers Portia (Lily Rabe) and Nerissa (Marsha Stephanie Blake) so soon, so easily, you can feel their disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ascene often performed playfully where the women reveal their disguises and tease their men for giving away the rings they promised to hold dear is here bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Night is setting at the end of the show on both the day's events and their illusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pacino is marvelous, especially given the temptations that Shylock offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In ways subtle and direct, we see he and the other Jewish men of Venice treated like dogs again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Antonio, of course, is the worst of all -- not just because he tries to cheat Shylock out of the profitable business of getting restitution from men who have defaulted on their loans, but because Antonio also leads everyone inrailing constantly against the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shylock is stunned when his daughter elopes (with a chest of money to boot), but Pacino doesn't stumble about in rage and despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just seems... adrift, lost, a shell of a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shylock latches onto revenge as the only way to give his life purpose again and Pacino comes back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wants his pound of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Antonio gets the upper hand and demands Shylock convert to Christianity, we realize the stakes:Shylock threatens a life but Antonio threatens a soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Shylock is baptized, it's done in a pool ofwater in the middle of the stage and the baptizer thrusts his head under with ferocity, practically 1 of 5 Alan Grayson Gabby Giffords: A Few Words Dylan Ratigan A Destructive CrossroadsDON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS HOT TRENDS TOP VIDEO PICKS Queen's Royal Wedding Rift 1 of 9 jwoww naked miley cyrus lap dance video natalie portman natalie portman pregnant rihanna PHOTOS: Guess Whose Sister More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.com Like 79 David &amp; Victoria Beckham Expecting Baby No. 4 READ MORE Report: No Second Seasonfor Sarah Palin's Alaska READ MORE Congresswoman GabrielleGiffords In 'Very Critical Condition' After Shooting READ MORE 'Glee' to Feature Gaga's 'Born This Way' Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens: Back On?

Elizabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post gave it 3 out of 4 stars and said, "You come to see Al Pacino, but you stay for Lily Rabe." Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News gave it 4 out of 5 stars and said, "The cause for cheers is director Daniel Sullivan's stirring version of "The Merchant of Venice," co-commanded by Al Pacino, a supernova you already know, as the moneylender Shylock, and Lily Rabe, a rising star you should, as the heiress Portia." John Simon of Bloomberg gave it 3 out of 4 stars and said, "Courageously, director Daniel Sullivan avoids making the revenge-thirsty moneylender more assimilated and sympathetic, or the duplicitous Christians less anti-Semitic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Essentially, we have here a comedic Jew, as the playwright no doubt intended him, in apart that today comes close to the tragic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ELF * out of **** At the Al Hirschfeld TheatreElf was a sweet little movie featuring one of Will Ferrell's best performances and our first realization that Zooey Deschanel could sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the story, Buddy is a little boy raised at the North Pole by the elves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even though he's twice the size of everyone else, Buddy is a little dim and doesn't clue in that he's...different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, when he's all grown up (physically if not emotionally) Santa spills the beans and Buddy is off toNew York City to find his dad, a high-powered businessman who might just need to learn the truemeaning of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ferrell had a naughty little glee in the role, but never varied from the innocence that made Buddy a charmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like a little kid, he wore you down with his enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not the worst idea for a musical, though it did smack of opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a ready-made property that can tour during the holidays and rake it in when families are looking for an outing they can all enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why be so cynical? Maybe Thomas Meehan ( Hairspray, The Producers, Annie ) and Bob Martin ( The Drowsy Chaperone ) aren't just guns for hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin weren't chosen just because they did The Wedding Singer on Broadway and hey, that was a movie turned into a musical as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Christmas cheer (before Thanksgiving, no less!) is hard to come by and the show very quickly confirms your most Scrooge-like fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; George Wendt of Cheers is Santa Claus and he's soon forced to make jokes about Santa having an iPad, Charlie Sheen, betting on football and other passing references that barely deserve a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kourtney K.'s Stunning Bikini Bod Jane Krakowski RevealsBaby Bump MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Airlines Video Germany House Of Representatives Extreme Weather Mila Kunis CES 2011 Health Care New York TimesHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â»One And Done: 'Sarah Palin's Alaska' NOT Renewed: Report 1,329 Comments PHOTO: Rihanna, Nicki Minaj Tweet About Hooking Up 26 Comments Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 1,068 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 109 Comments Joan Rivers Retiring From Red Carpet, Gets Reality Show 12 Comments Ashton Kutcher: Training, Paranoid About Real Life 'End Of Days' 904 CommentsSebastian Arcelus and Amy Spanger are both cast to type and coached into giving simulacrums of Ferrell and Deschanel when they play Buddy and Jovie, which doesn't do them or the show any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The costumes and sets are ugly and cheap, though to be charitable Gregg Barnes and David Rockwell were probably given pennies and ordered to keep it basic for easy loading and unloading as the show tourstown to town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the songs by Sklar and Beguelin have no such excuse, since a good song is just as easyto sing as a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or rather, easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the second act, genuine grumpiness had set in. "Nobody Cares About Santa" (a lament by department store Santas) and "Never Fall In Love" (Jovie's big number) aren't exactly good but have a certain peppiness otherwise lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sole example of cleverness is the modest trick of having the chorus open the show on their knees so that Buddy is towering over them up at the North Pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end, whenSanta is finally taking off in his sleigh - thanks to everyone embracing the true spirit of Christmas -- it's hardly a surprise to see the contraption lift a few feet off the ground in a rote, mechanical way and just stay there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this show, even the fake magic can let you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others have said: Charles Isherwood of the New York Times said, "The latest seasonal stocking stuffer and pocket picker in the mold of "White Christmas" and "Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas": tinseled in synthetic sentiment, performed with a cheer that borders on mania, and instantly forgettable." Elizabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post gave it 2 1/2 stars out of 4 and said, "Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin's score, while efficient, lacks the juice they brought to the underrated "The Wedding Singer." Casey Nicholaw's direction and choreography are similarly restrained, and only rarely summon theinspired mayhem the show needs." Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News gave it 2 1/2 out of 5 stars and said, "Meant to be the season's big happy hummable holiday event, the show never gets there; it feels unfinished and unready for New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director-choreographer Casey Nicholaw's resolutely middling production didn't have a regional tryout, but it could be a touring company that shuffled into town." Jeremy Gerard of Bloomberg gave it 1 1/2 out of 4 stars and said, "Parents hoping to avoid trendy seasonal cynicism may be tempted to lay out $137 apiece for orchestra seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Be warned: Your children over 8 years old will never forgive you." MISTAKES WERE MADE ** 1/2 out of **** At the Barrow Street TheatreOscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon is quickly becoming a talent you don't want to miss in any venue. (If you haven't seen the terrific indie drama Shotgun Stories , by all means check it out.) In what amounts to an acting class on display, Shannon shines again in a too-familiar look at a theatricalproducer (or agent or manager, it doesn't really matter) trying to stay afloat, get a big play off the groundand land a big movie star to anchor it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The script by Craig Wright has fun for a while, even as it trods cliched territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shannon is Felix Artifex, a two-bit talent who somehow has his hands on a play about the French Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Felix may be incapable of remembering that the main character is Robespierre,not Pierre, but he knows that a movie star in a big part will get this sucker made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But like any such impresario under inspection, Felix has to have multiple plates spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got aplaywright in the heartland who doesn't want to make changes, a movie star who hates to be put on hold,an ex-wife, a convoy in Afghanistan (or Iraq or somewhere in the Middle East; in any case it really stretches credulity) that he's gambled on to raise funds, and a fish in a tank Felix keeps overfeeding.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST His secretary is in the next room (a fine Mierka Girten who doesn't try and inject too much "character" into her part and plays it well) and of course there's the fish (manipulated by a puppeteer), but it's essentially a one-man show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shannon certainly holds our attention, sinking invisibly into the role butmilking every laugh he can out of Felix's desperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mildly diverting and a good showcase for Shannon,the play goes drastically off the rails towards the end, with plot twists both absurd and too heavy-handed for this slim drama to bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The revelations are completely unearned but the applause for Shannon is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others have said: Charles Isherwood of the New York Times said, "Despite Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shannon's excellent performance, as meticulously naturalistic in detail as it is vivid in its churning anger and anxiety, "Mistakes Were Made" is only fitfully entertaining and ultimately something of a grind." Frank Scheck of the New York Post gave it 3 stars out of 4 and said, " The play doesn't exactly break any new ground in its satirical look at small-time showbiz, but it's a terrific vehicle for Shannon, who rarely gets to show off his comedic chops." Brian Scott Lipton of Theatermania said, "It must be noted, though, that the work will resonate far more strongly with anyone who works in theater than most of the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, trimming about 15 minutes wouldn't hurt, as the play's sketch-like set-up occasionally becomes apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it would be a mistake to miss Mistakes Were Made and the extraordinary performance at its center." DEVIL BOYS FROM BEYOND ** out of **** At New World Stages Even a game cast can't rescue wafer-thin camp about aliens invading a small Florida town in the summer of 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in fast-talking journalists a la His Girl Friday and you know pretty much everything to expect from this comedy by Buddy Thomas and Kenneth Elliott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the context of the Fringe Festival (where it began) this was surely a pleasant lark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Off Broadway, not even the inestimable talents of Everett Quinton as a slurry, sex-happy housewife can justify this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Pecorino is Mattie Van Buren, a Rosalind Russell type who poses dramatically and italicizes her every speech whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Cormican is also good as the square-jawed, heavydrinking lover she needs to get the scoop of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aliens, yes ALIENS have landed in Florida,displaced the tired old men of the town and apparently replaced them with super-hot stand-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The modest pleasures on tap here come from the cast doing their best, not the script which isn't even original enough to steal in a shamelessly pleasing manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two stars in the rating are for Jeff Riberdyand Jacques Mitchell, who provide the requisite eye candy in a show like this by playing the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Riberdy in particular must be doing sit-ups and push-ups backstage to get himself so ripped for his scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A pale imitation of camp won't suffice but a hearty order of beefcake can take the edge of yourhunger for genuine laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What others are saying:Dan Bacalzo of Theatermania said, "Quinton knows how to wobble a syllable for maximum comic effect,Comments 6 Pending Comments 0View FAQ 67 Fans Mila Kunis On Kissing Justin Timberlake, Natalie...

B'way audiences are starved for those big, yummy show tunes, but they don't get them in contempora ry musicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What so many of these third-rate Sondheim imitators don't seem to get is that even in his most innovative shows, Sondheim made sure there were moments ofpure, beautiful melody, rousing production numbers, and comedy songs that were actuallyfunny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't be too hard on old Steve just because his disciples have failed to fully understand what makes his shows great, or aren't talented enough to write music that is both genuinely melodic and appropriat e to the dramatic situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've seen Pacino on stage twice many, many years ago and the memories are still vivid! First was Brecht's "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pacino as a 1930's gangster featuring the castof "Dog Day Afternoon" in a tiny 500 seat theater in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can still see Pacino's tongue darting inand out and side to side like a psychotic reptile.The second was Richard III on a stark stage at Harvard.I've never been in the same room with anyone as powerfully enthrallin g as Pacino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he is on stage near you run to the theater and get your tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You're lucky to have seen him in such intimate settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even in a big Broadway house,he's commanding .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I saw him in "Pavlo Hummel" and in his B'way "Richard III," and I know what you mean: It'smore than just being a good actor; there's some crazy kind of charisma going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I oncesaw Richard Burton in a play, and he had that same aura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The actress in the Merchant clip is awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looks like an acting school performanc e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH Permalink | Share it 3fingerbrown 12:10 PM on 11/19/2010 Permalink | Share it NHBill 12:30 PM on 11/17/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 11:49 PM on 11/18/2010 Permalink | Share it 3fingerbrown 11:33 AM on 11/19/2010 Permalink | Share it youvebeenflagged 11:58 AM on 11/17/2010 Permalink | Share it LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright Â© 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.</p>
