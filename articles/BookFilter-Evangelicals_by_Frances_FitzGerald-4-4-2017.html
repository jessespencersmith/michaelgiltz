"Evangelical" is a tag for people of many different religious and political beliefs, even if the Moral Majority and its ilk grabbed the megaphone and claimed to speak for all evangelicals andindeed all Christians for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tension has always existed between those evangelicals who focus on socialjustice (improving life for people in the here and now) and those who focus on saving souls (the here-after).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even there, it'snot an easy liberal/conservative split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evangelicals once pushed mightily for social causes like Prohibition, though later the same conservative element disputed any need to fight climate change or poverty as worldly concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One can also learn of altruism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When evangelicals were a persecuted minority, they strongly supported a separation between church and state;when they were ascendant and influencing policy in the 1980s and 1990s, far right evangelicals thought the idea of mergingchurch and state just fine and dandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This work is peppered with vivid profiles of forgotten figures as well as battles overlong-forgotten areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FitzGerald details major thinkers in the movement all along, not to mention the business acumen and political savvy of everyone from Ralph Reed to Rick Warren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ends with the new visibility of progressive evangelicals, offering a more nuanced picture of the people of faith that fall under this umbrella term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is particularlystrong on analyzing recent events and putting them into historical context, showing how the Tea Party is essentially theconservative Christian wing of evangelicals branded under a new name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is entertaining and eye-opening, fair and yet willing to quietly make her case with a battery of facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evangelicals on the right may not like some of FitzGerald's conclusions but they can't dispute the balance and scope of this history. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say “[A] capacious history of Evangelical American Protestantism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This rich narrative ranges across the various Evangelical denominations while illuminating the doctrines—especially personal conversion as spiritual rebirth,and adherence to the Bible as ultimate truth—that unite them. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A complex and fascinating epic.” - Booklist, starred review “Without a doubt the best book on the history and present status of American evangelicals. . . . ambitious, engaging, and nuanced.” - Harvey G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cox, Jr., Hollis Professor of Divinity Emeritus, Harvard Divinity School “This is the book I’ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now we have in one volume the richly textured, often puzzling, andalways engaging story of American evangelicalism from colonial days to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To understandevangelicalism’s impact on our country, this is must reading.” - Robert Wuthnow, Professor of Sociology and Director of Princeton Universityâs Center for the Study of Religion “FitzGerald has crafted nothing less than a spiritual history of the nation whose truest believers have for four centuries constituted themselves a moral majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an American story, objectively told and… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
