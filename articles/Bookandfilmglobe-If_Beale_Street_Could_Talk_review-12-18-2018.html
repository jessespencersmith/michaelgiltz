                <p>Saturday, February 16, 2019  FILM ‘Beale Street’: One Of The Best Films of 1959 Guess Who’s Not Coming To Dinner?  December 18, 2018 Michael Giltz Everyone deserves to see films about themselves, films starring beautiful people that tell their stories with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such movies play an important role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We all want to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet this noble, self-consciousand pious movie feels about 60 years too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this were 1959, Stanley Kramer were the director and the saintly Sidney Poitier was the star, If Beale Street Could Talk would be applauded as a landmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today? It will still be applauded, but probably with polite indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, it couldn’t be made in 1959 since director Barry Jenkins based this new film on the fine 1974 novel by James Baldwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, we witness a story of pure devotion between childhood sweethearts. (It’s a pity Jenkinsdidn’t tackle the far more vital, complicated and brilliant Baldwin novel, Go Tell It On The Mountain.) In Beale Street, Tish (KiKi Layne ) is a 19-year-old girl and the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She is definitely a girl and not yet a woman, as innocent and naïve as a young black woman from modest means can be in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fonny (Stephan James ) is her man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie begins with a storybook glow as they declare their love.I’ll get you a nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I promise.That moment takes place in a New York City positively alight with their wholesome and beautiful nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They glide through streets in tasteful clothes, dine in restaurants where Fonny chats casually in another language with his waiter friend Pedrocito (Diego Luna) and discover a loft space that a genial landlord (Dave Franco) willactually rent to a young black couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a moment they can see the American Dream coming true right beforetheir eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK (2/5 stars) Directed by: Barry Jenkins Written by: Barry Jenkins, based on the novel by James Baldwin Starring: KiKi Layne, Stephan James, Regina King, Brian Tyree Henry Running time: 117 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That dream derails when a Puerto Rican woman wrongly accuses Fonny of rape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A racist cop is to blame for the set-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You immediately know he’s racist because the film adores beauty and this sneering cop has pock-markedskin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fonny goes to jail, Tish goes to work, her family rallies to hire a lawyer and the baby is born in one of thesimplest (and cleanest) deliveries in recent cinema history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jenkins has followed up his welcome, Oscar-winning triumph in Moonlight with this dream project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It includes many of the same features: a production design that would make Douglas Sirk proud and a visual strategy where actors speaking to one another directly address the camera and thus speak directly to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it’s all a little…polite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lovers are so wholesome it’s a surprise to realize they’ve made a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the scene where they finally consummate their lifelong romance is helplessly timid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Layne and James aregorgeous people, so when James takes off his shirt one might feel a rush of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Except they’re so shyyou’re worried they won’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He looks down bashfully, she demurely removes her own shirt andthey’re so decorous, so tentative, so Adam-and-Eve innocent about it all that you keep waiting for the scene tofade to black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s a sanctifying strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But we don’t need saints any more; we don’t need Sidney Poitier to be the perfectNegro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That Sunday-best demeanor drains the story ofvitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The novel has two set pieces I anticipated: a meeting of the lovers’ two families when Tish announces she’spregnant and a dark monologue by Fonny’s best friend(Brian Tyree Henry) about the dehumanizing horrors of← No One’s Offended by ‘South Park’ Anymore Penny Marshall, 1943-2018 → Martin Landau Indicts Hollywood for Crimes and Misdemeanors  February 16, 2016 Robert Redford Premieres The Company You Keep  April 2, 2013prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first should be hilarious, but Jenkins makes it too stolid to really take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second works a little better, but while Henry does his best, it’s far too discreet to really convey the menace of the book at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a desire to inject some cold reality, Jenkins breaks up the action with historical photos of infamous discrimination against people of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s like a splash of cold water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it seems to come from a different universe than the rose-colored, dignified, quietly righteous and admittedly rather dull world of Beale Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tags: Barry Jenkins, Brian Tyree Henry , Diego Luna , If Beale Street Could Talk , James Baldwin , KiKi Layne , Sidney Poitier , Stephan James Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment,politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
