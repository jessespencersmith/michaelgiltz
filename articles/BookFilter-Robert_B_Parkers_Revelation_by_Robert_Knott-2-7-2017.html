Square-jawed, handsome, and built like a muscled thoroughbred stallion, Driggs manages to intimidate everyone inside the prison walls, including the upstart young warden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a haunting twist of fate, Driggs and a pack of cold-blooded convicts are suddenly on the loose‚Äîand it‚Äôs up to any and all territorial lawmen, including Cole and Hitch, to capture the fugitives and rescue the woman kidnapped during their‚Ä¶ Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What We Say I love a good Western.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So one of the many reasons I mourned the death of author Robert B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker was the very selfish one that he was just gaining steam writing a series of terrific Westerns about US Marshals Cole and Hitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terse, funny andviolent, the series was settling into an admirable groove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Parker writing one a year during the last three years of his life, it's literally the last roundup for this talented author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you haven't read them, by all means do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they've been continued by Robert Knott to modestly diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the fifth he's penned, so Knott has now outstrippedParker, though undoubtedly Knott would say he stands on the shoulder of what Parker began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One recent title ("TheShare This Book About The Author Robert Knott MoreRobert B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenserdetective series, the novels featuring PoliceChief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed VirgilCole‚ÄìEverett Hitch westerns, as well as theSunny Randall novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Happily, we're back to down and gritty here, with the two lawmen tracking some escaped convicts, uneasily aware that one of the bastards might be holed up in their hometown while they're away chasing the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't help loving these two men -- Cole with his iron-rod sense of right and wrong, Hitch's more expansive view of humanity, Cole's confusion over his lover's mercurial ways, their banter about grammar (Cole does love tolearn new words) and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They remain a treat, even if the story itself doesn't quite satisfy at the somewhat rote violentfinale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, I'll almost certainly feel drawn to hear from them again when a new book comes out -- which is precisely howand why a series like this continues long after the original author and inspiration is gone. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúKnott nails the terse, wise-guy dialogue‚Ä¶.Just damngood reading and painfully suspenseful.‚Äù -- Booklist Praise for Robert B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parker‚Äôs Blackjack ‚ÄúKnott . . . adds a new wrinkle here with a damn fine mystery running parallel to the western story. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fine reading for western fans.‚Äù ‚Äî Booklist ‚ÄúThis is the most satisfying of Knott‚Äôs Cole-Hitch tales, with a shocking double-twist ending.‚Äù ‚Äî The Sacramento Bee ‚ÄúWesterns need atmosphere as much as story, and Knott has a knack for six-gun verisimilitude, sketching theland and summer heat, the horses and the shopkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Knott‚Äôs especially good with the prototypical Old Westmarshal, Virgil Cole, ‚Äòperfectly present in the here and now,‚Äô every inch stoic lawman. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His tale gallops alongwithout confusing readers new to the series. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
