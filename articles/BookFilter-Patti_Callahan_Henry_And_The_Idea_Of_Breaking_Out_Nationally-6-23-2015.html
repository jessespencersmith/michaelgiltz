Since then, Henryhas fought through chemo, defeated the cancer and never skipped a beat in her fluorishing career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And now,two years to the day from that scary news, she's publishing her eleventh novel, perhaps the one that will breakHenry out to a wider audience.Like many of her books, The Idea Of Love has a strong concept ready made for Hollywood (Henry has juststarted to work with an agent geared towards that world.) In the novel, a once-hot screenwriter of romanticcomedies and dramas (think a male Nora Ephron) has endured two flops in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His marriage has alsodissolved and his teenage daughter isn't speaking to him.Desperate, he heads to small towns on the east coast, pretends to be an historian and charms local women intotelling their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of them -- he's sure -- will tell a story of true love that will break his heart and provide thekernel for a terrific new movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He succeeds -- never realizing the sweepingly romantic tale he hears is no moretrue than his own false identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Needless to say, the screenwriter and the pretty fibber fall hard for each other.While Henry isn't a "regional" writer, her work is very popular in the southeast but little known elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If shecan break out and bring the sales she enjoys there to the rest of the country, Henry's triumph of the past twoyears will be even sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rare for these days, her publisher is sending Henry out on a full-fledged book tour.Before the official launch, I caught up with Henry at her home in Birmingham, Alabama.To see the full interview, head to BookFilter.Here's Henry talking about her battle with cancer, the support of her family and friends and fans...and how thatcrisis was capped by Henry having a very serious hiking accident.Here's Henry talking about how Nora Ephron inspired both this book and her work as a writer.Here's Henry talking about being a preacher's kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her family moved down to South Florida and then movedagain and again for four years, from seventh grade to tenth grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Henry burrowed into books to escape herfeelings of loneliness and found not just a place to hide but a source of strength.To see the full interview with Patti Callahan Henry, head to BookFilter.NOTE: Patti Callahan Henry is a friend of the family for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually, I eagerly tell family andfriends I can't review or write about their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conflict of interest! (Believe me, it's the easiest thing to do when12/16/2015BookFilter: Patti Callahan Henry And The Idea Of Breaking Out Nationally | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=f8ac63f0-4a6a-4407-88df-3ba5f0aa7318&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/2someone urges on you their unpublished manuscript or band CD.) However, when I met Henry she had alreadysuccessfully published seven or eight novels with a major house and hit the bestseller lists, so her success andmedia attention had already established Henry as a writer worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, she offered to makeBloody Marys for the interview.Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Head toBookFilter if you want to find more great picks in every category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover smart picks by our crackerjackstaff, not crowd-sourced reviews saying -- yet again -- hey, you should read "The Girl On A Train!"
