RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES ($39.99 BluRay Combo or $29.98; FOX) -- I did NOT spend the entire movie thinking, "What great special effects! Man, the apes mix in with the humans soconvincingly!" Nope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead I was caught up in the character of Caesar (Andy Serkis), the result ofhuman experiment who is raised with love but realizes he and his people are in fact in chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subtle,funny, scary -- Serkis is marvelous and well deserves a nomination for the Academy Award.

The supporting actor category will probably come down to Christopher Plummer versus Albert Brooks but I'm rooting for Serkis to make the short list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That will be a huge victory in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie has silly moments (mainly includingJames Franco's gal pal Freida Pinto, the least observant girlfriend and scientist in history).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it'sprobably the best popcorn movie of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOKYO DRIFTER ($29.95 DVD or $39.95 BluRay; Criterion) BRANDED TO KILL ($29.95 DVD or $39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- Don't get me wrong: any good movie is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But let's be honest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes Important Films can be awfully...important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisone-two punch from Japanese director Seijun Suzuki is important and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tokyo Drifter is a nutty,colorful, super-cool mash-up of Sergio Leone set pieces and James Bond cool features gunman Tetsutrying to go straight and maintain the code of honor, all while his suffering songbird of a girlfriend singsthe song "Tokyo Drifter" almost as much as he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gorgeous and absurd sets, striking cinematography,beautiful actors and a plot that makes almost no sense turn this gangster tale into a surreal, hilarioustreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Branded To Kill is in black and white but somehow ups the ante visually while telling the story ofan assassin (the iconic joe Shishido) who loves, loves, loves steamed rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These two movies were sodeliberately nonsensical the director was fired by his studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you like Quentin Tarantino, dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Most Awkward Wedding Photobombs Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) PHOTO: Christina Aguilera's 'Your Body' Dress Doesn't Leave Much To The Imagination DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 John Hillcoat Lawless: Reinventing the Gangster Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ben Cardin This Is No Way to Win an Election TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2Like 715 Like 2k Like 195 Surprising New Aniston Rumor Kim K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wants Hollywood Star Alanis Morissette Samuel L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jackson's Shocking Tweets About Isaac Jon Voight Blasts Obama Administration, Mainstream Media Shia LaBeouf Dropped Acid For His New Film WATCH: Raging Grannies Have Some Words For Todd Akin THE HELP ($39.99 BluRay and $29.99 DVD; Touchstone/Dreamworks) THE HANGOVER PART II ($35.99 BluRay and $28.98 DVD; Warner Bros.)

Unlike fans of, say, Family Guy vs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simpsons (people who hate each other so much they can sort of respect their differences), fans of Futurama and Simpsons both love Matt Groening and probably love entire seasons of each other's shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they can argue endlessly over which is better and when and really hate each other because they're practically family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In comparing vintgeSimpsons to versus new 'Rama, I'd give this round to...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simpsons .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Portlandia is a sketch comedy show set in Portland, Oregon and it's as daft as that sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to join a cult, watch this show.SpongeBob remains eternally amusing and defiantly upbeat; I much prefer to get this series by season than those endless repackaging of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underbelly is new to me, but it's an acclaimed Aussie drama invariably referred to as their Sopranos .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it received genuine praise and was a strong commercial hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show sprang from the most famous crime waves in Aussie history and was so topical trials were still going on for the criminals depicted -- TV had to be blacked out in some parts of the country to avoid influencing jurors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Chad Michael Murray is lone gone but OTH still won't die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the zombie of TV soaps!
