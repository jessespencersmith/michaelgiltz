                <p>Entertainment Featuring fresh takes and real-time analysis from HuffPost's signature lineup of contributors Michael Giltz Freelance writerGET UPDATES FROM MICHAEL GILTZ Follow Theatre , Video , Neil Labute , Paul Rudnick , Edward Hibbert , Off-Broadway , Entertainment NewsReact Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Bullet" Shoots Blanks; "Summer Shorts" Fall Short SUMMER SHORTS SERIES B ** out of **** BULLET FOR ADOLF * out of **** SUMMER SHORTS SERIES B ** out of **** 59 E 59Theatrical shorts are a very forgiving format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you're seeing three or four brief plays in an evening, you're often quite friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You don't dread a short play that doesn't immediately grab you -- hey, maybe it will get better and even if it doesn't, in 25minutes you'll be watching something else! Perhaps that explains why I didn't mind this slight evening ofplaylets from artists of considerable talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Rudnick provides a monologue for the very talented Peter Bartlett called "Cabin Pressure." Bartlett plays a flight attendant giving a speech when he receives the Medal of Freedom from the President forfoiling a terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We soon learn the really annoying passenger wasn't the terrorist but a hedge fundmanager who kept being pushy and demanding and rude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We also learn our hero's partner is an out ofwork cake decorator who goes to AA and waves his hand whenever the flight attendant digresses, whichis about once or twice a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh, there are amusing lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rudnick is incapable of delivering a piecewithout some amusing lines and Bartlett squeezes every bit of humor out of it with impeccable timing.Thanking this and that person and "whomever is managing Lindsay Lohan" may be sort of amusing, but Rudnick can do this sort of thing in his sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And compared to his far superior work in the recent Standing On Ceremony collection of one-acts about gay marriage, this falls short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, there are worse ways of spending an evening than enjoying Bartlett nail his lines. "Love and Real Estate" is a curious musical by two talents new to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sam Davis (music) is a top arranger and conductor with some intriguing composing work under his belt (like the upcomingBunnicula .) Sean Hartley (book and lyrics) has delivered some acclaimed work I didn't get a chance to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This tale -- very vaguely linked to "The Three Little Pigs" -- is about three sisters who move to NewYork City and are preyed upon by a charming wolf who desires not their flesh but their fabulousapartments. (Any New Yorker can relate.) It's a rather static affair that heads exactly where you think itwill, with a capable cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're all overshadowed by Edward Hibbert who plays the narrator anddelivers the one distinctive number, a novelty piece called "Love and Real Estate" with his usual aplomb.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Mitt Romney To Flood Victim: 'Go Home And Call 211' Paul Ryan Admits Marathon Lie Former 'SNL' Star Makes Shocking Comments About Rape And Gay Friends What's Up With Those Circular Marks On Curiosity?

(Again, turn it up! What thehell!) Then come a barrage of clips containing pop cultural moments and highlights of that era, rangingfrom MTV to AIDS to Ronald Reagan and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At first it seemed desperate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Were they that worriedwe'd forget what year the play was set? But as the show progressed, the well-chosen barrage of clipsproved the most entertaining segment so I actually looked forward to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The storylines hardly bear repeating since they're so confusing and convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They seem like entirely separate tales; when the characters start bumping into each other, it's almost a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You've got a couple of guys working on a construction site for a dour German.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of them is fired and this dude, who insists he be called the "Dago-Czech" and dubs himself a brother to boot, declares he will get revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actor LeeOsorio plays him with red meat verve; if Harrelson told the rest to turn it up to 11, Osorio decided 22 would be twice as good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, why not? Then you've got one of the construction guys with a mild history of embezzlement named Frankie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He goes on a job interview and rather oddly starts to hit on the beautiful woman he's hoping to work for,raving about the sunset, barely bothering to describe his credentials before asking her on a date and soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to describe how awkwardly unconvincing all this is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You think for a while they're trying for acertain tone or heightened reality or maybe Harrelson has some grander purpose, but in fact it's justweirdly off on every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throw in an 18 year old girl, a guy who may or may not be closeted and thatGerman's antique Luger which was used to attempt an assassination of the Fuhrer and you've gotyourself a play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least, the gun goes missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first act ends with a frantic dinner party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Racial taunts are tossed out and dialogue is traded but none of it makes any sense -- none of it ever does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At one point a character laments the Germans doing him wrong and asks if it's all some sort of Teutonic plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To which the 18 year old girl responds apropos of nothing that he better stop treating her like a little kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? You'll be saying that a lot if you go seeBullet For Adolf .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the utter lack of logic here, the actors soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The women come off better than the men, withMarsha Stephanie Blake delivering some humor as the no-nonsense Shareeta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The talented ShamikaCotton (such a hateful mother in The Wire! ) has an appealing presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Shannon Garland almost makes some sense out of that 18 year old kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The men have less success, with Tyler Jacob Rollinson asFrankie and Nick Wyman as Jurgen the German coming off best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Imaginary Media delivered thevideo montages that are peppered throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't think I wanted to see a string of old sodacommercials, but darned if seeing Telly Savalas plug a pop didn't make me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Woody Harrelson chatting about the play on The View.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peggy Drexler Why It’s Important To Let Your Child Make Mistakes Gary Hart Welcome to the American Republic, Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eastwood TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 8 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESWhat Is Gene Simmons Doing With His Lips Colin Ferguson Shows Up At LA Premiere Spencer Matthews TalksAbout The Bachelor Winner Khloe PETA: Rihanna And Lady Gaga Are 'Freaks' Legendary Songwriter Dies At 91 Celebs React To Eastwood's Wild SPeech When Can You See The Final 'Hobbit' Film? aol RetweetIn honor of Labor Day, here are some of TV's hardest workers http://t.co/XTjvtfGy via @HuffPostTV aol RetweetStaying in this Labor Day Weekend?
