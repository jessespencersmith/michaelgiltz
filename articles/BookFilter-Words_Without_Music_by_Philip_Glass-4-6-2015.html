"If you go toNew York City to study music, you'll end up like your uncle Henry,"Glass's mother warned her incautious and curious nineteen-year-old son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the early summer of 1956, and Ida Glass wasconcerned that her precocious Philip, already a graduate of theUniversity of Chicago, would end up an itinerant musician, playingin vaudeville houses and dance halls all over the country, just likehis cigar-smoking,‚Ä¶Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This Book Go to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site whereyou can get this book.BookFilter12/1/2015BookFilter | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=6bbfea31-a018-4d51-b2d4-e8be9d693508&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/3 Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayAs a lifelong fan of Philip Glass, this memoir is tailor made for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glass might have focused on one key event in hislife -- such as the original mounting of "Einstein On The Beach" or an eye-opening journey to the east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He might havedelivered his thoughts on classical music and the best way for a would-be composer to prepare himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glass couldhave focused on his childhood, before the music starts in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, he does a little bit of everything, offeringup anecdotes from his youth (like smashing unsold LPs so they could be returned as damaged goods); telling howduring his first audition for Julliard as a flutist, Glass was stopped and told, "You don't really want to play the flute, doyou;" the teachers who molded him through fear (Nadia Boulanger) and love (Ravi Shankar); being broke after thesold-out success of "Einstein" and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mixed in here and there are Glass's still scrappy defenses of his music.Sure to be enjoyed by admirers, it's probably too discursive to win Glass some new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want a good musicalintroduction to his work, I always send people to the film "Koyaanisqatsi" or the album "Glassworks." If you're alreadya fan, be certain you'll enjoy Glass in whatever mode he holds forth here. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say‚ÄúPhilip Glass's place in musical history is secure.‚Äù - The New Yorker‚ÄúAmerica's most significant symphonist.‚Äù - Los Angeles Times‚ÄúAn icon of the avant-garde.‚Äù - Fader‚ÄúThe most prolific and popular of all contemporary composers.‚Äù - New York Times‚ÄúAn engaging memoir of an adventuresome, iconoclastic career‚Ä¶Writing with warmth and candor, Glass portrayshimself as driven, self-confident and tenaciously determined to invent his own, radically new musical language.‚Äù -Kirkus Reviews‚ÄúPhilip Glass has written a fascinating account of his life with recollections of family, teachers, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From hischildhood in Baltimore to his studies with Ravi Shankar and Nadia Boulanger and the collaborations with RobertWilson, Allen Ginsburg, Godfrey Reggio, and Martin Scorsese, among others, Glass offers insights to his music andpersonal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Words Without Music will be a pleasure to read, not only for musicians (although they will particularlyenjoy it) but for anyone interested in the world of art.‚Äù - Paul Simon ‚ÄúNo matter your opinion of Glass‚Äô music, you will like Glass the man‚Ä¶.Aspiring musicians‚Ä¶MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....12/1/2015BookFilter | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=6bbfea31-a018-4d51-b2d4-e8be9d693508&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;3/3</p>
