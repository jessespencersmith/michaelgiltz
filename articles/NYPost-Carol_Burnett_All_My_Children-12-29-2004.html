"I wanted to do it but I couldn't get to New York, so they flew out here," says Bur­ nett, who has played the campy Southern gal Verla Grubbs sev­ eral times over the years. "I was really flattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They flew Bi­ anca [actress Eden Riegel] and the gal who plays Simone [Terri Ivens] out here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They flew out Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We did it Tuesday, and they flew back Tuesday after­ noon which was really sweet." Grubbs - a very loud, fashion­ challenged character -pops up again next Wednesday in a Pine Valley cameo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bianca is in a coma: T.R. (Tarnh Young) is being betrayed by his father, Adam (David Canary); and Erica (Susan Lucci) is bat­ tling over the paternity right to Baby Bess/Miranda (the name depends on who you believe the father to be).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is more, the show's cre­ ator and mother-figure, Agnes Nixon, will also make an appear­ ance on the show -her first ever. "Verla runs into Bianca in the hospital hallway," explains Bur­ nett, who is just finishing up work on her TV version of the musical "Once Upon a Mat­ tress," the show that launched her career. "Of course, Bianca is holding the baby and I'm just thrilled they're together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's very cute because 1 say, 'Oh, I've been fol­ lowing your story with the sto­ len baby, the blood, the this and that and the lying blonde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm so happy you're back together: She exits and 1 just look up to hp~'Vpn -:=tnri C":l17 '~rlTT'loh("'\rl-.:r,," there, can't they be happy for just five minutes? Is that too much to ask?' " Apparently so, since even the babies on set aren't happy for more than five minutes. "They're twins and they're boys," says Burnett. "They can't go on being girls for long unless there's a whole new storyline and they go to their mother and say, 'You know, 1 want a sex change: "The baby that they use more often just lights up in front of the camera and really listens when people are talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfor­ tunately, 1 made them both cry. "I think it was the way I was dressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She wears the big wig and the loud voice and both of the little guys started fussing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We did get one take where [one] was quiet but when we wanted to do a close-up, we had to use a doll because I just scared them both and came on too strong," she laughs. ''I'm scaring babies ro ...... 1I ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; P"</p>
