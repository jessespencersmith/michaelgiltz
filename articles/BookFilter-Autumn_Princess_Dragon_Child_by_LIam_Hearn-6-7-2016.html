In Autumn Princess, Dragon Child , the old order has come unsettled and the weave of destiny has become unpredictable as it is pulled tighter, sharper, faster, by the instincts for vengeance and redemption, loyalty and survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The battle for the Lotus Throne has begun in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this medieval Japan of Lian Hearn√¢s peerless imagination√¢so‚Ä¶ Rate This Book Add To Wishlist |Rate/Review Add To Bookshelf Get This Book Personalize / Add More ChoicesGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site where you can get this book.Share This Book About The Author Lian Hearn Release Info List Price: $14.00 (Paperback) Published: June 07, 2016 Publisher: FSG Originals Pages: 288 ISBN 10: 0374536325 ISBN 13: 9780374536329What We Say The best-selling author of the "Tales Of The Otori" adventures has another four-part winner in "The Tale Of Shikanoko." Call it a Japanese "Game Of Thrones" and you'll get a vague idea of the fun on tap here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While George R.R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin's cycle drawsupon the epic fantasy of Tolkein, writer Lian Hearn harkens back to the classical models of Japanese works like "The Tale OfThe Soga Brothers." Martin is looser, rawer and more sprawling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearn is more formal and rooted in the ethos of honor familiar to fans of filmmaker Akira Kurosawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here's the really good news for "GoT" fans: Hearn has written a 1000+ page epic, it's been split into four parts and they come out one after another, with Volume 1 arriving now, Volume 2 inJune, Volume 3 in August and Volume 4 in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So no waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Believe me, I've read the first two and once you startyou'll think that's not soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first two books -- "Emperor Of The Eight Islands" and "Autumn Princess, Dragon Child" -- we begin with a lord who (Lear-like) creates turmoil by demanding his eldest take the wife of the second-born son, sending the latter off to a rival clan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's determined the family will survive the coming civil war one way or another.Needless to say, it proves disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The characters come tumbling out, especially our hero Shikanoko, who tumbles fromone home to another, first targeted by a jealous uncle, then coming under the sway of a mountain sorcerer, later learningthe wily ways of a thief and finally becoming the servant of yet another master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taking center stage at one point or another are royalty, commoners, men of magic and women of cunning, monkeys, demons, and the true Emperor who must go into hiding when a usurper takes the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's tremendous fun, with Hearn taking the point of view of a particularcharacter for each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To her credit, the people who seem like villains (and sometimes truly are), become complex,full-bodied people we can have empathy for even when they do terrible things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's magic here, but just as GoT ismostly a realistic spin on the War of the Roses, this story has the feel of a classical fable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and am very frustrated the series of works that movie drew upon have never been translated into English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, even most of the classic tales Hearn references are available only in dry academic versions if at all. (Justas we await a truly thrilling English language translation of the Chinese Monkey King stories.) With meticulous attention todetail for the period, along with a bone-deep appreciation for Japanese culture, Hearn's homage to those masterpieces is as close as we're going to get for the moment and tremendously entertaining in its own right. "The Tale Of Shikanoko" has romance, intrigue, fantasy, passion, betrayal, sacrifice and the suspense of truly having no idea what will happen next, whowill survive and who will triumph...not to mention wondering whether triumph will mean the characters we root for mustbecome characters we don't recognize anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now where the heck are Volumes 3 and 4? -- Michael Giltz What Others Say √¢In Autumn Princess, Dragon Child , Lian Hearn's mythic Japan fully unfurls, expansive and engrossing, rendered in crystal-clear prose that reads like the translation of a book from outside of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This kind of story, written with this kind of craft, has become rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are fugitive royals and evil monks; there is forest magic and highpolitics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The swords all have names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There√¢s a name for this genre, even if you don√¢t see the label stuck toshelves much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The word for The Tale of Shikanoko is: adventure!√¢ √¢Robin Sloan, author of Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Penumbra√¢s 24-Hour Bookstore√¢Lian Hearn has written a one-of-a-kind epic series brimming with spirits, demons, and warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is asdeeply imagined and immersive as it is addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One doesn√¢t know whether to give in to the desire to turn thepages as quickly as possible or to linger and savor Hearn√¢s crystalline prose and striking emotional observations.Hearn√¢s characters grab you by the hand on page 1 and whisper, √¢Follow me.√¢ It√¢s a pleasure to obey.√¢ √¢KellyLuce, author of Three Scenarios in Which Hana Sasaki Grows a Tail Praise for The Tale of Shikanoko √¢[Emperor of the‚Ä¶ More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
