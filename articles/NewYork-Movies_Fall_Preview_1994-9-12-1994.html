"Woody Allen gives you complete and utter freedom," says Cusack. "He doesn't really care what you say, as long as it's in character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you come in, he's got the shot mapped out, but it's sort of like a ski run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you want to take some other moguls, you can do it."

Few movies are more anticipated than Interview With the Vampire, with Tom Cruise as the charmingly evil vampire Lestat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Neil Jordan was ready for a Gothic thriller: "When this book came up, 1 thought, This is perfect," he says. "I wanted, I needed, to go in the direction of the grotesque." (November 18.) Following in the footsteps of Katharine Hepbum, Winona Ryder plays the spunky Jo in Little Women, director Gillian Armstrong 's third attempt to go Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armstrong finally may have the right project and the right cast: Susan Sarandon , Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Gabriel Byme, and Eric Stoltz. (December 25.) Hepbum also makes her presence felt in Love Affair, the Warren Beatty-Annette Bening romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Hepbum acts in TV movies every so often, she was initially quite reluctant to tackle another feature-film role. "I really had to pull her," Beatty says. "It was one of the most enjoyable experiences that 1 ever had in the movies-getting her to do it and working with her." (October 14.) Beatty hardly knows how to make a movie without being nominated for awards, and Jodie Foster is the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nell has Oscar writ large all over it, from its origins on the stage (Mark Handley's Idioglossia) to its top-drawer adaptation (William Nicholson wrote the screenplay; Michael Apted . directed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foster has the title role of a backwood s woman completely shut off from the Photograph s by Linda R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CheniMiramax(2). world until her mother dies.

(Decem ber 21.) Every movie Robert Redford has directed received at least one Oscar nomination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there's no . reason to expect less from his fourth, Quiz Show, a thoughtful look at the 1959 TV scandal that took away what little was left of America's innocence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It features Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow, and John Turturro , who gives a memorable performance as Herbert Stempel, the contestant who helped blow the whistle. "Herb didn't really feel like he was cheating," explains Turturro. "[In real life], Herb is a conniving executive and Michael Douglas the poor schlep who fends off her advances , only to watch Moore brazenly accuse him of harassing her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't ask Dennis Miller-a weasely office buddy of Douglas's­ how he approached his role. "I don't know anything, quite frankly, about acting," he admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, what's the movie like? Steamy? Tension-filled? "I kind of tried to stay away from reading the whole script," he says. "I didn't want to muddy my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So 1 know as much about it as you do." (December 16.) Wesley Snipes plunges into the world of skydiving in the Not'a Ephroll's 'Lifesavers,' -with Steve Martill. thriller Drop Zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the first chance for Snipes to carry a big­ budget action flick since Passenger 57 helped raise his asking price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Badham IIIIIII directs, and Gary '1111111 Busey looks to raise his i profile, II la Tommy ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MiI.1 Lee Jones in Under '9'l Siege.

"They try to fob him off as a genius," says director Fred Schepisi. 'The scientists have him around a bit to discuss this thing he's supposed to have discovered: cold fusion." ot that again, surely. "Actually, someone at Princeton came up with something while we were there filming," he laughs. ''I'm hoping he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will make the movie very spot-on." (December 9.) The romantic comedy Junior reunites director Ivan Reitman with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito, and gives him a chance to work with Emma Thompson .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, Thompson is a scientist who develops an interest . in Schwarzenegger , while he develops an interest in having a baby. "We could really camp it up and go for cheap laughs, but it's not like that," says Reitman. "It's not silly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's under control, and it evolves in a beautiful way." ( ovember 23.) ora Ephron's latest, Lifesavers , takes place in a Venice, Californja, suicide­ prevention center on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Word from the set is that Juliette Lewis gives one of her funniest, most appealing performances .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Martin is merely effortlessly good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Photographs: top left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fran~ois Duhamel/Geffen Pictures; top right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve GranitzlRetna; center right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stills/Retna: bottom right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Felber/Universa l: bottom left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Vaughanffri Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEPTEMBER 12, 1994/NEW YORK 65 V) Q) &gt; o E (December 16.)

NEW VORl&lt; FILM FESTIVAL Kenneth Branagh brings to life Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expect a nerve­ rattling performance from Robert De iro as the monster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expect the beautiful Helena Bonham Carter to be frightened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And expect a buffed Branagh to deliver as many or more Gothic chills and swooning romance than Francis Ford Coppola's wigged-out , blood-soaked 1992 take on Bram Stoker's Dracula. (November 4.) Ralph Fiennes, Christopher McDonald, John Tllrtllrro ill 'Qlliz Show.'

"['m Geena Davis's fiance, a war correspondent known as Baghdad Bob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whether there's any resemblance to the Scud Stud, I leave you to guess." (December 16.) The plot of Star Trek: Generations seems sensibly action-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rip in time brings together Captains Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard (Patrick Stewart); they unite, in tum, against a madman (Malcolm McDowell) who threatens the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director David Carson pooh­ poohs any suggestion that other cast members might be unhappy with its focus. "[ think the cast is very wisely thinking, Well, if we make this into a wonderful movie, then there will be a lot more movies which will hopefully focus on the other characters." (November) 8.) In The War, Jon Avnet's follow-up to Fried Green Tomatoes , there's more than one battle going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A father (Kevin Costner, in a supporting role) tries to adjust after returning from the war in Vietnam, while a group of kids-including Elijah Wood-fight over a treehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avnet described one boy with an especially creative approach to acting. "We would sit there and wonder, How is he going to find another way to hide his face from the camera? It was amazing." Did the kid ever loosen up?

"He's so beautiful as a man and then he's so beautiful as a woman, and you think, I can't compete." (September 28.) SMALL BUT GOO D I Like It Like That, ABOUT the travails of a young black-and­ Latino couple, is a terrific debut for Darnell Martin. (October 14.) British director Ken Loach delivers another wrenching drama, and Crissy Rock gives an amazing performance in the fact-based Ladybird, Ladybird. (December 9.) With Red, Krzysztof Kieslowski concludes his trilogy based on the colors of the French flag, ending on a marvelous and inspired grace note. ( ovember 25.) Frank Darabont delivers a promising feature-film debut with The Shawshank Redemption , the Stephen King story of a convicted murderer (Tim Robbins) and his friendship with a prison lifer IrelleJacob in 'Red." There's equally intriguing fare during the run of the festival, September 23 to October 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hal Hartley's latest, Amateur, has Isabelle Huppert as a former nun who writes for a porn magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already pegged as a crowd-pleasing favorite is Strawberry and Chocolate, a comedy set in Havana that details the romance between David, an uptight college student, and Diego, an older, openly gay, and far more cosmopolitan man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Italian Dianne IViest and Johll Cllsack in Wood; Allen's 'Bllllets Over Broadway.' director Nanni Moretti, voted Best Director at Cannes, shows Caro Diario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILD CARDS TOMMY LEE JONES HAS A perfect, meaty role as Cobb, the bigoted but supremely talented baseball star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sports auteur Ron Shelton wrote and directed.

At one point, to help him focus, Broderick used a vivid memory from his childhood. "I was painting with a lot of intensity," says Broderick, "painting a big piece of paper on an easel, and spilling so much paint that it was running all over my shirt, my shorts, and running down my leg, and it gave me some kind of clue."

"We showed the U.N. successfully waging a war, rescuing hostages, and feeding hungry children," he says. "I guess it was so contrary to their public image that they worried people would get confused ." (December 23.) DUELING SAN T A S WHY REDO Miracle on 34th Street? Producer John Hughes has argued that the original had a terrific Santa in Edmund Gwenn but was noticeably lacking elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's countered early criticism with the dead-on casting of Richard Attenborough as Saint Nick. (November.)
