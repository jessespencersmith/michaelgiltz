I don't care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gunsmoke began airing in 1955 -- these episodes are more than 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it ran for 20 years so they've got 600+ episodes to sell! Do you reallyexpect people to buy roughly 40 boxed sets at $36 each? More than $700 to own one show? What's worse, they released the entire 39 episodes of season one for the same basic price as HALF of what season two will cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How does this make sense? It doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jake and the Fatman and Cannon were journeyman shows at best -- do they really need to be doled out in this way ($36.98 each; Paramount) for half of their first seasons? If 22 episodes of USA Network's modest hit seriesThe Big Easy ($49.98; MPI) can be made available in one set, so can the Fatman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm delighted the puppy dog cute Kyle Chandler (who came into his own on Friday Night Lights ) can be seen in Early Edition First Season ($49.99; Paramount).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now where's his earlier series Homefront? New shows are no better sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HBO has always charged a premium for its shows -- $60 for13 episodes of The Sopranos worked out to quite a premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then they bundled all the seasons together in a boxed set costing more than $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And coming in November, you can buy the entire series with soundtracks and extras for about $400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the right direction to go in, but since everyone who loved the show has been buying it all along, frankly the 86 episodes should have been even cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other big TV mistakes: releasing The Cosby Show -- one of the most popular sitcoms of all time -- with truncated episodes pulled from the syndication version rather than the original full-length episodes. (Other shows have done this as well.) Releasing some seasons of a show but not the rest -- where in God's name are seasons 5-7 of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, the greatest sitcom of all time? Yes, cable shows have fewer episodes so maybe it's no surprise The Closer Third Season ($39.98; Warner Bros.) and Monk Season Six ($59.98; Universal) and Eureka Season 2 ($39.98; Universal) and Psych Second Season ($59.98; Universal) are complete sets. (And no, there's no good reason for Monk and Psych to cost so much more than Eureka except that they're more popular.) But Tyler Perry's House of Payne Volume Two ($29.98; Lions Gate) has 20 episodes, as much as any network sitcom and they're not holding back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither is Walker Texas Ranger Fifth Season ($49.99; Paramount), the Chuck Norris hit that kickboxes its way into fans' home complete andready to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The History Channel's Dogfights Complete Second Season ($49.95; A&amp;E) has 17 episodes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What can you do about it? Don't buy 'em.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any show released in fragments is a show you should avoid like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter how big a fan you are, don't let them double dip, as they'd say inSeinfeld .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shows that are 20, 30, or 40 years old don't deserve more of your money than a new series and as a viewer and buyer, you don't deserve any less than full seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't buy them and DO support full and complete TV shows sold season by season, believe me, they'll stop making 'em.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Some of the DVD sets mentioned are not out yet but will be released in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week:Glitterbox: Derek Jarman X 4 ($74.99; Zeitgeist) -- A wonderful presentation of four major works by the boldly experimental director, including Caravaggio (an unconventional biopic) and Blue ( which is literally a blue screen with voices and sounds ruminating on the color).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Far from comprehensive (since it doesn't include major works like Edward II, The Last Of England or his music videos), this is a perfect introduction to a director whose stock will soar in years to come and made touching by a tribute film created by his friends after Jarman's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure to be one of thebest releases of the year.

Papaya, Love Goddess of the Cannibals ($29.95; Severin) A sexploitation flick starring Roger Vadim discovery Sirpa Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I happily quote the liner notes: "Severin Films is shamelessly proud topresent...fully restored -- including the complete Disco Cannibal Blood Orgy sequence -- from anItalian vault print seized from the private collection of a jailed magistrate!" I doubt the film is asentertaining as those notes, but you never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xanadu Magical Music Edition ($19.98; Universal) -- a notorious flop -- and deservedly so -- starring Olivia Newton John and (god forgive him) Gene Kelly in his last movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strictly for loversof the truly awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging Right Now Ads by Google Cars Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Bank Of America War Wire Video Financial Crisis MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When they put it out in one box for 40-50 buck, that would be when we will buy it, and not before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I don't even care about S4 at this point, I am so po'd about about the whole 1 year break - 10 eps, then another year break thing. 3fingerbrown See Profile I'm a Fan of 3fingerbrown permalink Hey Michael: Have you ever done a buyer-beware post about my number-one DVD pet peeve: Replacing the pop songs on the soundtrack with generic Muzak because the production company willnot or cannot acquire the rights to the original music? It really burned me, after I spent a bundle on some "Odd Couple" seasons, to discover that scenes involving popular music have been altered or cut entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deadly for a show that relied heavily on pop culture references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What a rip-off! I've heard that the DVD sets of "WKRP" are mere shadows of the original broadcast episodes, which derived so much of its flavor from the actual '70s hits the fictionalstation was playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anyone willing to buy "Jake and the Fatman" in any form deserves to be hoodwinked. robiform See Profile I'm a Fan of robiform permalink That's been a pet peeve of mine, too! Getting rights to original music is what caused the very long wait for "Miami Vice" (the series, not the movie!) on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And if music rights can't beobtained, well you get the experience I had when watching the DVD of the first story arc ofthat memorable series "Wiseguy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last episode was extremely memorable for many Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:20 PM on 06/30/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:17 PM on 06/27/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:14 PM on 06/27/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:56 AM on 06/27/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: TV Show Boxed Set Rip-Offs http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-tv-show-set-rip-offs_b_109215.html [4/5/2009 2:08:29 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry reasons, one of them being the use of songs like "Nights in White Satin" by the Moody Blues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the producers couldn't get the rights to "Nights in White Satin" and that blew the whole episode out of the water for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caveat emptor, indeed! jbelkin See Profile I'm a Fan of jbelkin permalink I'm not disagreeing with you but I think it's for the following reasons: a) They know Netflix &amp; Blockbuster cannot "wait" and will buy it anyway no matter the price - and while they won't actually make twice what they would've made by selling a single set, they can make maybe30-40% more so ... why not.b) hardcore fans will pay anyway to be first on the block ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, months later - "average" fans will buy it when it hits below $30-$40 for a season set.But as you point out, not only is it dumb to issue a truncated edited version, the shows where the original music gets stripped out is POINTLESS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to believe with 5 major studios who own most of the properties cannot work out deals with the music labels (many they own!) and instead try to foist shows on us with new music LIKE WE WOULDN'T NOTICE. booksnmore4you See Profile I'm a Fan of booksnmore4you permalink And in other news: Analysts say TV show downloading with bittorrent reaches recent new high. bored2tears See Profile I'm a Fan of bored2tears permalink I'm already there with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I own Seasons One and Two of "Dynasty," but refuse to buy the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because CBS/Paramount (is anyone else detecting a trend here?) is releasing 12 episodes as "Season Three, Volume One." The number of outraged pre-reviews of the set on Amazon.com indicate that the fan revolt is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The majority have refused to buy anything but a full-season set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this is how CBS intends to handle future releases of other series, I am more than happy to continue profiting from my short position in the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Ads by Google Classic TV/Movies on DVD Bowery Boys, Amos 'N Andy+More Everything ships Free-Buy On Sale! www.TheOldTimeTheater.com Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:24 PM on 06/27/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:16 AM on 06/27/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:28 PM on 06/26/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:58 PM on 06/26/2008Michael Giltz: DVDs: TV Show Boxed Set Rip-Offs http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-tv-show-set-rip-offs_b_109215.html [4/5/2009 2:08:29 PM]</p>
