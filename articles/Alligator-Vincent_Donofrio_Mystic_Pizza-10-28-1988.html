                <p>By MICHAEL GILTZ In Mystic Pizza, a new romantic comedy currently playing at the Oaks Four West Theater, much is made of "Mystic Pizza," a popular local delicacy with mysterious ingredients in the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equally mysterious is Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio, the actor who plays Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has appeared in three features in roles that are wildly disparate, both in temperament and physical looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Full Metal Jacket, D'Onofrio had the plum part of Private Leonard "Gomer" Pyle, the lumbering, overweight recruit who is turned into a killing machine all too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Adventures in Babysitting, he did a small turn as a mechanic who resembles Thor, the god of thunder in Norse mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two films were released around the same time and Vincent Phillip D' Onofrio fells UII Taylor why he reads 'Applause' cover-fo-cover. the change in his appearance garnered D'Onofrio a lengthy Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the character of Bill, lie faces his most probable role yet: a young, A rican male who feels uncomfortable about having s with his girlfriend, Jojo, because she won't commi to their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; D'Onofrio told in a teleph ne interview about preparing for his role as a fishellman in Mystic, Conn. "Before we started shooting,' he said, "I was hang­ ing out with a lot of the fish'!! en, trying to get to know what they were reall like: the way they treated their wives, the way ey looked at their girlfriends. '1 was very fortunate to hav Lili (Taylor) play my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We just wanted it tf be realistic because we knew that the comedic lines would work for themselves ." Th1'!ir relationship is just one of many stories in Mystic Pizza, an amiable, understated comedy that Mysterious sauces and mysterious men spice up the cinema wittitheir flavor centers on three young women who work together in a pizza parlor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of them, Katherine (Annabeth Gish), is a somewhat frumpy, young woman strug­ gling to find the money to afford the tuition at Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jokingly called St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katherine because she always does the right thing, Kat finds herself falling in love with the good looking, older man whose daughter she is babysitting while his wife is in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her sister Daisy Qulia Roberts), is a vibrantly at­ tractive, free-willed person who has little going for her other than the force of her personality .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She be­ comes emotionally entangled -against her better judgement -with Charlie, a rich preppie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third woman is Jojo (Lili Taylor) who begins the movie by panicking on her wedding day and fainting at the altar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She spends the rest of the movie wavering between her love for Bill and her fear of making the wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; D'Onofrio enjoyed the challenge of his even­ tempered, somewhat moralistic character. "Bill was different, sort of a role reversal for a guy to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was also a vehicle for me to show people that I wasn't a psychopath." That, of course, is a reference to his most visible performance, the critically acclaimed portrayal of an over-th~ge recruit in Full Metal Jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though the part has given his career a major boost, it was also extremely demanding. '1 was with Stanley Kubrick for 13 months," he notes, sounding tired at the mere mention of it. "Just carrying that weight around and the intensity of the role -the extremes that the character goes through -weighed very heavily on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was something that I'm glad I did ... something I'd never do again." Something he would consider doing again is return­ ing to the role of Bill in a sequel to Mystic Pizza - if the script was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such an event is a distinct possibility, since the movie is turning into a quiet success story at ~he box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because it is a small film with an unknown cast, distributor Samuel Goldwyn decided to give it an unusual limited release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rather than pushing for a big opening weekend - an unlikely possibility at best -they have opened the movie on a relatively small 386 screens and sup­ ported it with a strong ad campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus, Mystic Pizza has become one of those rare features given the opportunity to find its audience, and the gamble has paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reviews have bef&gt;n favorable and attendance has been growing every week, indicating a positive audience response and good word-of-mouth .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If all goes as planned, film­ ing will begin next year on a sequel that picks up the storyline five years down the road. "It's always nice to say 'Let's do a sequel,'" said D'Onofrio. "But it depends on who directs it and it depends on what it's about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My first thought is that it is a very good idea." And what does D'Onofrio see five years down the road for Bill and Jojo? '1 see a lot of children," he jokes. "I see havoc." Mystic Pizza was a vehicle for D' Onofrio to prove he wasn't a psychopath. , '</p>
