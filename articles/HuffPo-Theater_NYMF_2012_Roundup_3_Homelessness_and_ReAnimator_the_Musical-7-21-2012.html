This is the third in a series of roundups covering shows appearing in the New York Musical Theatre Festival , or NYMF .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every year I attend as many shows as I can and invariably see one or two that will rank among thebest of the year, as well as discovering some new talented performers and behind the scenes artists I'll want to keep an eye on in future productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to the NYMF website for more info on inexpensive tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RE-ANIMATOR THE MUSICAL *** out of **** REQUIEM FOR A LOST GIRL ** 1/2 out of **** RE-ANIMATOR THE MUSICAL *** out of **** THE PEARL ON 42ND ST.Here is a ready for Off Broadway crowd-pleaser complete with a pre-sold title, a strong cast and a "splash zone" in the first four rows where audience members can happily don ponchos so the copious amounts ofblood and other fluids that are sprayed from the stage can be enjoyed to maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Re-Animator was a key horror film in the comic wave that included Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 and other gleefully goofy fare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Stuart Gordon has returned to his earliest success with pleasure, tweaking the book he co-wrote and helming this musical to pitch it at a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie's most infamous moment (involving a re-animated head and a sex act) is still present but more suggestive thanoutrageous and the rest of the violence is actually kind of sweet since it's done with old-fashioned theater tricks and all for laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daring parents can take older kids without fear, as long as they're not embarrassed by a lights-out sex scene (lots of silly moaning) and buckets of blood spilled purely for theheck of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dan (Chris L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McKenna) is a dutiful med student in love with the daughter of the dean (George Wendt of Cheers ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a caring physician in the making until his new roommate turns out to be the obsessed Herbert West (a pitch perfect Graham Skipper).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Herbert isn't accusing their teacher Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hill (Jesse Merlin) of plagiarism, he's down in the basement trying to bring dead flesh back to life...and succeeding! The tone is mock serious from the very beginning, with a functional if not overly imaginative set by LauraMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Chipotle Busted For Cheating Customers Out Of Pennies Republican Attendees Thrown Out After Racist Attack On CNN Worker RPatz Agrees To Meet KStew But Is Selling Their Home MAP: Hurricane Isaac's Path Aims For Gulf Coast PHOTO: The Queen Rolls In A Range Rover Wearing A Hoodie Deaf Boy Asked To Make Controversial Change (VIDEO) GOP Approves Abortion Ban Isaac Balloons Into A Hurricane, New Orleans Threatened Limbaugh's Wild Isaac Conspiracy DON'T MISS HUFFPOST BLOGGERS 1 of 5 Bill Moyers WATCH: Both Parties Give Invisible Americans the SilentFOLLOW USAround Town Restaurants Real Estate NY Impact Best of New York NYPD Scandals Parties MTA WTC August 29, 2012 Edition: U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA STYLE FOOD TECH ARTS GAY VOICES LIVE ALL SECTIONS Bill Moyers Dean Baker John Hillcoat Bobby BowdenHOT ON THE BLOG HuffPost Social Reading Like 102 Posted: 07/21/2012 3:39 am SHARE THIS STORY Submit this storyLike 1k Like 12k Like 78 Recommend 281 Like 1k Like 4k Recommend 9k Recommend 693 Like 7kRepublican Convention Celebrity babies Green Living Chile Log in Create AccountFine Hawkes serving as a home, hospital, lab, morgue and so on with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one really cares since the main focus is to spray blood, pass around a squishy brain among the audience, camp it up bybeing deadly serious and generally have a messy, silly time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The songs by Mark Nutter are all functional as well, just like the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They move the plot along, never wholly transcending their silly roots but never slowing things down either (no mean feat in a swift story like this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly by the end there is less than meets the eye here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look no further than Joss Wheedon's(not him again!) Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Horrible's Sing-Along Blog for a silly premise that can find genuine emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's not a whit of genuine emotion here, but since they're really not trying for any you hardly miss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you go looking to see Re-Animator The Musical and hope for lots of blood and gore, you'll be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main reason is Gordon's light touch and an excellent cast that elevates the material and turns what is essentially a forgettable romp into a pleasing if forgettable romp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You won't remember much of anything an hour after it's over, but the cast makes the evening quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wendt is game in his smaller role and Merlin is very good indeed as the nefarious Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skipper brings a geeky sexiness to West that could have been exploited further but he's focused and mad, mad, mad I tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The secret weapons here are the two romantic leads, Dan and Megan ( Rachel Avery ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They shoulder the sort of bland roles that usually fail to make an impression since the bad guys get to have all the fun and chew up the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But McKenna and Avery actually create genuine and compelling characters of a sort in the midst of this goofiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of being boring time-killers until the next baddie can rant andrave, they actually fill the stage with two interesting people that held your interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the guys next tothem were usually the undead, the semi-dead and the stark, raving mad, that's saying something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond the songs, Nutter's score is appropriately spooky and the lighting and (messy) special effects are all enjoyable low tech and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You know what to expect when going to see something called Re-Animator The Musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How often can you see Rocky Horror anyway? As long as you don't expect any more, you'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And wear an old shirt if you plan on sitting in the Splash Zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REQUIEM FOR A LOST GIRL ** 1/2 out of **** THE THEATER AT ST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLEMENT'SIf good intentions created great theater, Requiem would be a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, this "Chamber Musical About Homelessness" has more going for it than good intentions, namely an interesting hybrid of a score and some excellent directorial touches by Doug McKeag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is essentially a memorial service to the memory of a girl lost to the streets, a girl that the show's author of book and lyrics Onalea Gilbertson knew growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gilbertson created Blanche: The Bittersweet Life Of A Wild Prairie Dame, one of my favorite shows of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That too was a "found" piece in a way, since Gilbertson based it on interviews with her grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So this show -- which features a chorus ofpeople who've dealt with homelessness and contains original poetry and raps by them alongside the moreconventional songs Gilbertson has composed -- feels very much in the same vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given her track record, I ventured to see it, despite the vague, afterschool special vibe a description of the show might rouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I really should know better since my late aunt Peggy Ann Walpole founded Street Haven, a series of halfway houses and transitional homes in Canada for women coming off the streets or out of prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was her life's work and I know well the many lives she touched and how varied and rich their stories were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She began her work in 1965 in Toronto, while this show has its roots in Calgary and Canada's largest homeless shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast includes people from there as well as cast members from Covenant House, Henry Street Settlement, and Fountain House here in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The details change over the years but in their broad outlines, the stories are depressingly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a glimpseTreatment Dean Baker Poverty: The New Growth Industry in America TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 9 MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGESIsabella and Jayden Top NYC Baby Names Yun Zi's 3rd Birthday Party PATH Command Center Tour 40 YEARS TO LIFE BREAKING: Gunman Shoots 5 Outside Empire State Building The 'Dumbest Drug Law' In The Country?
