(Just don't kill me, please.) -- Michael Giltz What Others Say Praise for Jason Shiga and the Demon series: "I truly think Demon is one of the best comics that has come out in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's surprising, unique,and insanely well crafted." âBrian Michael Bendis, author of the Ultimate Spider-Man series "Jason Shiga has done something remarkable with Demon: created a surpassing morally repugnant protagonist I still root for because of his prodigious intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm ashamed of myself for liking him!" âAdam Savage of MythBusters "Itâs bizarre, sick, funny, and more than a little depraved, all of which is part of its charm." â Nerdist I respect Jason so much for following his audacious, wild, insane muse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demon is raw, explosive fun.â âChesterBrown, author of Paying For It "Crazy + Genius = Shiga!" âScott McCloud, author of The Sculptor "Murder and suicide have never looked so adorable." â Booklist - What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
