Ok, but first Gould is gonna school you on how all of American music is inextricably tied up with race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'll give a sharp,knowing rundown of the minstrel shows that swept the nation, why record labels embraced hillbilly music (ie. country) but turned its nose up at "race" records (yep, prejudice), the rise of radio stations and why a focus on r&amp;b only happened when TV stole the attention of most households and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In lesser hands, this might have felt like the inevitable padding out ofa life short on details (Redding was rarely interviewed, kept no journal and died at the age of 26).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gould beginsShare This Book About The Author Jonathan Gould JONATHAN GOULD is a former professional musician and the author of CAN’T BUY ME LOVE: The Beatles, Britain &amp; America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He divides his time between a home in Brooklynand a house near Hudson, NY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $28.00 (Hardcover) Published: May 16, 2017 Publisher: Crown Archetype Pages: 480 ISBN 10: 0307453944 ISBN 13: 9780307453945with Redding's ancestors and then his childhood, eventually moving on to chart his career and the rise of indie r&amp;b record labels (obviously including Stax) in engaging detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The book begins with Redding's monumental performance at Monterey, flashes back to the beginning and ends with his creative leap forward with the song "(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay," a record so terrific it might well have hit #1 on the charts even if he hadn't died tragically in a plane crash months earlier.One can't help wondering what this artist just coming into his own might have accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gould does justice to whathe did achieve and paints a vivid, passionate picture of how one can't appreciate Redding or the rise of soul music withoutlearning more about the never-ending struggle over race in America. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say One of Men's Journal's "Best Books of May 2017" “An excellent and definitive biography… A master storyteller, Gould tackles Redding’s life by planting his flag firmly at the crossroads of individual genius and social andcultural context… [His] fabulous portrait…provides Redding with the “Respect” he richly deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlyrecommended.” —Library Journal (starred review) "A music biography with the depth to do its subject justice.Otis Redding (1941-1967) ranks high in the pantheon of 1960s musical luminaries, so it's fitting that [OtisRedding] ranks equally high among such work focusing on popular musical artists....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better late than never, the soul master receives his considerable due in this superbly researched and written biography." —Kirkus Reviews (starred review) "Gould vividly brings to life the man Stax Records boss Jim Steward called 'a walking inspiration'....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From his supreme triumphs to his one last heart-breaking phone-call to Zelma, devotees and soul scholars alike could not wish for a more thorough and sensitive portrait." —Kris Needs, Mojo “Nuanced and well-researched…. [Otis Redding] belongs in the hands of anyone who cares about soul music in the sixties.” —Booklist What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
