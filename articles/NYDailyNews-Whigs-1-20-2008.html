"['ve alwa."-s been a nerd about late- night TV perfonnances," says lhe 25-year- old Gispeft, rvhose band will also be per- forming at the Music Hall of Wllliamsburg in Brooklyn on feb. 1. "I actually have a giant VHS collection of different people playing on late-night telelision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C;rowing up, if anybody was conring on that I liked, I would tape it and s atcl r it ovtsr ar rd over Jgai n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So il's prel - ty cool that I get to go on now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm pretty pumped up abcut it." The lvhigs (a name chosen because it sounds vague and interesting. not be- cause they hirve anv paflicular aftiniry* for the l9th-century politlcal group that was a precursor to the Republican Party) are promoting their second album - and ma-jor label debut - "NIission Control," out Tuesday on ATO Records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were tabbed by Rolling Stone magzine as "the best unsigned band in America" irr 2006. and their album is already getting massive praise and com- parisons to everyone from the Replace- ments to the Strokes and Pavement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Athens, Ga.-based band isn't takinâ‚¬l Lettennan lightl]', and Gispen will draw on everything he's learned bv watching other acls lackle lhat chilly studio. "Just as important as any ofthe good ltips] would be, 'Don't do this,"' he says about the lessons he's learned by watch- ing. "Stuft you can't articulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'd just u'atch someone's backing band and the drummer is playing a cefiain way and youwas in a lot of bands and "sucked." while Dorio stayed at home, plalang along with CDs and was generally acknowledged for his skills by being dubbed "freak dummer guy." They headed to Athens for college, when Gispert was waylaid by a series of major illnesses, including shingles and mono. "l was in tbe hospital for 35 days," says Gispert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Dorio kept visiting during Gispefi's re- covery over the next six months; they bonded. and smn after the Whigs were fomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a story per-fect for the Internet age, they and original bassist Hank Sullivant bouglrt recording equipnent on eBa),. recorded an album over a summer at Sullivant's frat house, then re-sold the equipment on eBav forjust about theThe WhiBs signed with AIO lthe only one that didn't immediately have a doz- en ideas about what to change about the band and their music).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The anist- friendly indie launched by Dave Matthews also feafures Ben Kweller and lvly Morning Jacket, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gispetl knows that Vru- Tube may have brought his obsessive taping days to an end. btrt he still watches late- light TY and his band can no*' be a part of his collection. "l feel like we're fofiunate." says Gispert. "A lot of people who end up on those shows had a song they rer:ord- ed jn the studio and got on the radio or Nl.f\,: Bul the way we'\'e grown as a band is as a live band playing in bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So giving a I)enDrmance on Iatc-nigl)t televrsiun is just doing s'hat ) ou do every night." a</p>
