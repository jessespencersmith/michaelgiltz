                <p>WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2019 THEATER: "Einstein's Dreams" Too Elusive For Reality EINSTEIN'S DREAMS * 1/2 out of **** PROSPECT THEATER COMPANY AT 59E59 Alan Lightman's charming novel Einstein's Dreams was a best-selling sensation in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lightman's day job is a physicist and his first and best work of fiction playfully combines both disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In it, heimagines Einstein is working on his Theory of Relativity and dreams about the various ways one can think about time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What if time really did stand still? What if time proceeded in circles? Or skipped andstuttered or reversed itself unexpectedly? Each dream of time iscaptured in a fragmentary passage lasting just a few pages at most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'snot really a novel or even a collection of short stories, but more like a variation on a theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lightman lets you feel you grasp certain abstract scientific ideas, all while entertaining you thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But there's no plot to speak of, noover-arching thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's just fanciful fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the packaging of the book added to its appeal: Einstein's Dream was about 5 inches wide by 7 inches tall, almost a square, friendly little book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It fit into your hands comfortably and made this Italo Calvino-like work quite approachable.Instead of thinking, a book about physics and running away, you sawit and smiled and picked it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I read it, I enjoyed it and not for a single moment did I think, this should be adapted for the stage! It's one of those works that wouldseem to resist a transformation into film or theater or TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, Ifelt the same about Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Turn that daunting, philosophical novel into a film? Absurd! Turn the classic Powell-Pressburger movie A Matter Of Life and Death into a stage play? Ridiculous! Well, as a film, Unbearable became another masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a play, A Matter Of Life and Death was a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hey, they tried!
