I presumed it would be about people like myself, who fight for gay rights but also hap­ pen to he conservative on for­ eign policy and economic issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, what I read was a story on gay conservatives who are in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The criticisms leveled against them ~ that they must compro­ mise their principles, they must lie about their private life to pro­ tect their career, etc.-apply just as strongly to gay liberals who work in Washington and don't feel ready to be honest about their sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might have written about the men and women who or­ ganize the national gay con­small group of people and attack them for not being open about their sexual orientation -never remembering that most gay people from every imaginable economic, social, and political background are also in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the gay community ex­ pects society at large to become more tolerant of diversity, we must learn to be a lot more will­ ing to accept it from our own.
