For years, their paperback reissues of obscure, forgotten or never-appreciated gems have had a magnetic pull on book lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They use a recurring design on their covers so you canspot them a mile away and I've almost literally never been disappointed by their picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Criterion is for films on BluRay, NYRB is for books -- if they put it out, you'll want to read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now they're doing the same with kids books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So without even glancing at the author or any other details, I simply grabbed a copy of "The Doorman's Repose" simply because it was fromNew York Review Children's Collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like others in their series, I was immediately delighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's an unknown treatShare This Book About The Author Chris Raschka MoreChris Raschka has written and/or illustrated more than sixty books for children, including Yo! Yes? Charlie Parker Played Be Bop ; Mysterious Thelonious ; Sluggy Slug ; Five for a Little One ; A Poke in the I ; and The Hello, Goodbye Window .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has received ‚Ä¶ Release Info List Price: $17.95 (Hardcover) Published: May 16, 2017 Publisher: NYR Children's Collection Pages: 176 ISBN 10: 1681371006 ISBN 13: 9781681371009(unknown to me, at least) about the people living in a New York City building and the doorman who works there. (He's a very good doorman despite being the rare doorman who has no interest in sports and can't chat knowledgeably about batting orders and the like.) What a pleasure -- you get stories about the building eccentric, kids, old people, the family of mice who swap homes with country mice every summer, the inevitable nosy neighbor who finds pleasure in bossing othersaround, the city law that requires every large apartment building to have at least one opera singer in resident, a finickyboiler and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each tale was a treat, an innocent reminder of...wait, what? The internet? How could some kid's bookfrom the 1950s or 1970s or 1920s or whenever this first came out reference the internet? Dear God, this book is by Chris Raschka and it's brand new! Can one pay a higher compliment to a book of this sort than to say you believed without a shadow of a doubt it was a long-lost classic that had simply escaped your attention? So consider this a future classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eachtale gently builds on the one before (that nuisance of a tenant is given her modest due in a later tale) and it culminates ina final story that delivers the work's entire philosophy of life (we're all connected to one another, whether we like it ornot) in one final aria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, they might have included a map showing Garden Avenue in Manhattan or at least better directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I keep looking for 777 Garden Avenue on the Upper East Side but can't quite seem to find it. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say ‚ÄúRaschka‚Äôs genius lies in capturing the essence of situations that are deeply felt by children.‚Äù ‚Äî School Library Journal What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
