(The following week, two people will be sent packing and the save is onlygood until the show reaches the Top 5.) Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson confirmed one of them was worth saving but apparently it was the under the weather Paige and not Lacey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show began with former Idol winner David Cook performing a solid version of "Jumping Jack Flash," talking up an album in the works and his upcoming trip to Africa for Idol Gives Back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later performances included Orianthi doing her new single "According To You" (then delivering a thoroughly unremarkable anecdote about auditioning for Michael Jackson) and Ke$ha's Gaga-like "Blah Blah Blah." Do you agree it was Lacey's time to go or should the judges have used their save?

Thx. okay for lacey to go - though liked her closing save-me performanc e urban has been putting on that what me? shock face for too long. lots of bloggers on other sites seem to swoon for him. he has weakest voice i hope paige has a break out moment. she does have a power voicemichael lynche annoys me - something insincere about him i can't put my finger on.aaron was great with angie but my gut favorite is lee dewyze.michael - did you already clarify if it is the top 10 that goes on tour rather than the top 12? I'm not Michael, but historical ly it is only the top 10 that goes on tour, next weeks show sill be about who gets to go on the tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They do the same build up so they can start selling the tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I agree with your take on Lynche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Something phony there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I admittedly , liked the Urban version of Under my Thumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never liked the song before, but I enjoyedthe fact that he tried something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I think that shocked look is genuine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After theripping to shreds he got by the judges, I think he expected to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the overpagenty Amber Tamblyn look a like is the one with the worst voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She has hit her peakas a singer and has nowhere to go but down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yikes! Wrong again about the tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I absolutely believe Urban's stunned reaction tonot being cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If it's fake, he's a much better actor than singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And since thejudges have given him loads of criticism (except for Hallelujah ), he had every reason to believe he could be cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks guys for the tour correction .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't really watch the show, but I heard Lacey's "Ruby Tuesday" on a morning news show, and Ithink she proves that what the endless auditionin g process Idol uses is looking for is decidedly NOT talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, she deserved to be sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige is overrated, whether she has laryngitis or not, so it's not surprising she's in the Bottom 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her rendition of Chaplin's "Smile" (when she was healthy) was cringe-wor thy, and it's hard to tell if that odd vibrato in her voice is the result of nerves or bad technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Urban's rendition of Under My Thumb" wasn't nearly as bad as everyone made out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Castro went far doing that exact kind of thing, and Sting has made a career of it. yet it's spooky he mayparlay the teen idol thing past where he should go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paltrow Dishes on Cruise Kiss Raven Symone's HugeWeight Loss Jessica Szohr's Sobe StripDown MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW HOT ON FACEBOOK HOT ON TWITTER Celebrity Body Celebrity Skin Ellen Degeneres 112th Congress College Football Gulf Oil Spill Mad Men NBA EnergyHUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â»Permalink | Share it anonimost 02:01 PM on 3/18/2010 Permalink | Share it Burnsey 06:02 PM on 3/18/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:04 PM on 3/23/2010 Permalink | Share it DaveinNorthridge 01:44 PM on 3/18/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:32 PM on 3/18/2010Camille Grammer's Porn Past Comes Back To Haunt Her 745 Comments Natalie Portman: I Was 'Barely Eating' During 'Black Swan' 34 Comments PHOTOS: Olivia Wilde Dons See-Through Bikini 45 Comments Most Anticipated Indie Albums of 2011 (SLIDESHOW) 9 Comments Beastie Boys Rapper Beats Cancer 52 Comments Which Stars Will Play The Lead Roles In 'The Three Stooges' Remake? 81 Comments59 Fans 43 Fans 1 Fans 2 Fans 59 FansLacey should have gone, should have gone before Lilly as far as that goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wonder why she was overpraise d for doing "The Story" initially when what makes that song amazing was Brandi Carlisle's ability to be fragile at first, then break into full-throa ted rocker in the same high key, something Lacey avoided altogether .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was like listening to someone cover "Stairway To Heaven" while doing the soft ballad at thebeginning, and then totally omitting the rocking second part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But at least now they're letting themchoose their one-for-th e-road song, rather than forcing them to sing the song that got them booted off, which seemed like cruel and unusual punishment .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard sometimes for the band to have multiple versions ready to perform for every contestant .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since the band had already worked up an arrangemen t for The Story, I agree that they let the contestant choose, rather than forcing them to sing the song that put them in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, I'm glad they perform while the judges talk rather than after gettingbooted (a change I suggested in seasons past) because it let's them sing to stay, ratherthan warble during the pain of knowing they're gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BTW, Michael is spot on regarding Ke$ha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's hard to believe the producers of AI are so hard up for filler material that they turn over their platform to that wannabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her performance was so ridiculous , it was a wonder that half the contestant s didn't depart in the middle of it, having suddenly decided they no longer wanted to be in show business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forget waterboard ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just play Ke$ha and Heidi Montag songs back to back and the CIA will get all the confession s they can handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Knew she was a no-talent when she was trashing Britney Spears earlier this month, instantly making Britney sympatheti c for the first time in ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, did she really have to remove all doubt in front of millions and millions? This is the first time I have heard Keisha sing I thought at first it was the judges idea to have her and then after she finished they would judger her and send herhome and keep all the kids and say that is not what we ever want to see any ofyou do! What was interestin g about last night's show was how Crystal Bowersox was given the opportunit y to explain herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously the Judges are doing everything in their power to try to position her as the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But again..... ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She acts like a frumpy old woman who keeps an 8x10 glossy of Tyrone Power on her bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paige Miles is a great singer despite the fact that the Judges have decided she will not go far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerning Michael Lynche:... ....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Am I the only one who thinks it's inappropia te for a large-size d man to dance and act like he's a skinny, teenage kid?FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:45 PM on 3/18/2010 Permalink | Share it filmex 12:48 PM on 3/18/2010 Permalink | Share it zacmap 12:51 AM on 3/21/2010 Permalink | Share it JohnKevari 11:39 AM on 3/18/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 12:47 PM on 3/18/2010 2 Fans 30 Fans Follow 59 Fans 164 Fans 164 FansTyrone Power? Funny, but I don't get a granny vibe from a chick with dreadlocks singing the Stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And you're wrong about the judges and Paige: they said that they would usethe save on one of the bottom two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since they didn't use it for Lacey, clearly they wouldhave used it to save Paige this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It may just have been her illness and they won'tnecessaril y use it for her down the road, but at least they agreed with you that last night was too soon for her to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's be honest, five years from now when someone brings up the name of CrystalBowersox it will be followed by the qustion; "She owns how many cats?" There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All Actually I'm glad that Crystal got to say something because EVERY season Simon et alpick a frontrunne r and ram them down our throats and at times that can backfire (remember the Daughtry fiasco?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What Simon said the other night about Crystal's performanc e, then went on to say that she can't feel she has this in her pocket was just wrong, so I'm gladthat Ryan let her say something about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wow, did I just say something nice about Ryan? Will wonders never cease.Anyway, I actually like Crystal but I think that Siobhan is the better singer/per former for the girls and I hope she does well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She won't need to win to have a career, but it would be nice to see her go far in this competitio n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I actually like Mike's voice, though not a fan of the dance moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has talent and willlikely go much further than most of the guys, along with Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron will get the tween/teenvote, as will Tim Urban, though he isn't as good as Alex Lambert who didn't even make thetop 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought David Cook gave a very good performanc e, but I wasn't crazy about Orianthi's vocals, though her guitar playing was stellar and she can really shred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I could have done without Keisha altogether and I hope that future results shows don't repeat this week's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking forward to next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any idea what the genre/form at will be?

Maybe so, but not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The was crude, grating, amateurish and I don't think evenSHE believes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, OHHHZZZZZ. .. the dramazzz this week of Simon and Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Could it possibly get more contrived? Maybe I'm just getting to old to watch this show any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to be a fly on the wall in a producer's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just sayin' I agree with your comments about the pro performers .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook was good but the other two were dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan and Simon's face-off is just a joke of course and not a very good one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The average age of the viewers of Idol is creeping up into the 30s....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well my last comment didn't make it through moderation .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let me try this.....I am on the west coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AI has not yet aired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you must spoil, could you please be a little considerat e and keep it out of the headline? Or wait an hour, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I sympathize , but I've learned to avoid cruising the internet when I haven't yet viewed the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That way Michael gets to finish his work before bedtime and we won't get a spoiler,so everyone's happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AmandaRuth , I'm sorry to have spoiled the show for you by posting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunat ely, I'm not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you go onto any news website, they will have the results in a headline or a ticker of breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Huffington , they often also post the AP story on the results with photos of who was sent packing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Generic headlines (like "Idol ResultsAnnounced" ) just don't cut it with editors and readers, I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If I delayed posting the results, people who wanted to know would just go to other websites, defeating the purposeof providing coverage on HuffPo in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, if I delayed an hour, someonewould ask for it to be delayed two hours till they got home from work. (I used to have thisproblem with "24," when the show was so hot the plot twists would be discussed the nextmorning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I can wait and watch two weeks at once without fear of stumbling on aspoiler.) As with the Olympics and the Oscars and sports all live events, I'm afraid you just have to avoid going online to news sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same thing happens to me: some weeks, when I'm late watching the results on DVR, I forget and go online to check my email andspot the FOX press release in my inbox with the name of who got cut in the header.Arghh!
