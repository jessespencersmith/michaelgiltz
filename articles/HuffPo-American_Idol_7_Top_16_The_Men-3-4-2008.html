He flattened out the melody, seemed tomess up some of the lyrics and his thin higher register -- where Menard seems to live -- all butdisappeared on what should have been a triumphant "high" but really petered out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DavidHernandez, I noted again, was a dedicated dancer, always moving along to everyone's performance.Paula said Luke's upper register is fantastic, which is insane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon dropped the hammer, called ita bit "girly" and said Menard "can't win." He's going home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta -- Oh it's so boring when there's a presumptive winner but things can changedramatically when you hit the Top 12. (We've got three months of performances to go, so no one is really a lock.) Then David sits down at the piano and delivers the last and biggest hit from Phil Collins, "Another Day In Paradise." (It was #1 for 4 weeks and the last #1 on the Top 100 for Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also had a massive adult contemporary hit with the Oscar-winning "You'll Be In My Heart" fromthe animated flick Tarzan , but that's a different chart.) Is there anything he can't do? Well, maybe, but I'd look for a little Spanglish at some point since he mentioned singing a song in Spanish in theintro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And why in God's name did Ryan mention the fact that David had to pee? is he trying to naildown the scatalogical vote for the kid, too? Fine if not overwhelming performance but his so-so iswell above average and the versatility on the piano was winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, he's against homelessness!Simon said Archuleta would "probably be in the final two." Danny Noriega -- I thought Danny was dancing like a stripper, which is ironic since I found out Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

(Not a record, folks.) Danny's video intro was especially campy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He talked about being tripped up at the movies. "I fell in front of one of my crushes and I turned as red as a cute little tomato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then I ran." (You know what caught my ear? When he said "one" of his crushes.) He sang "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell and I just know he wished he could do the medley version that segues into the Supremes classic "Where Did OUr Love Go?" He sang in a lower register and personally I thought his vocals were just about as strong as he's ever been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the whole presentation -- the shaking of the hips, the dramatic arm movements -- were super campy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus the purple hair streaks and his "whatever" retort to Simon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, he'll never win the whole competition because he's not one of the Top 4 or 5 singers.But even though I think he alienated a lot of viewers this week, he still gets the second mostsqueals from girls after David Archuleta (Danny's their BFF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It doesn't matter if a lot of peopledon't vote for you as long as some people do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remember Sanjaya? And those teenage girls are demons on the speed dial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hey, he's certainly entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hernandez -- I've liked David more and more every week and he didn't top last week's "Papa Was A Rolling Stone," but it was another solid, very Idol -friendly bit of vocal gymnastics, marred only slightly not by weak vocals (they were confident and great) but by a weird little thing he did with his eyes while singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought Celine Dion's "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" was avery good choice for him because nothing secures votes like big notes, though Simon is right thatsoul is his wheelhouse, not ballads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what the heck was it doing on a list of Eighties songs?Celine Dion had a hit with it in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it was a UK hit for Pandora's Box in 1989: they went allthe way to #51 with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, it was a very minor hit in the UK that even people there wouldn't associate with the Eighties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David was choosing from a list of songs provided by theproducers that had anywhere from 50-200 items on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So again, what was it doing on a list fromthe Eighties? As for David being a male stripper in gay bars and doing lap dances for thecustomers, as long as there's no scandalous video or really racy photos he should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's notillegal so the Idol producers have no issue with it. (The website Frenchie appeared on insinuated the girls appearing on it were underage which is why they dumped her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still feel she got robbedbut appearing on a website promoting desire for underage girls is far different than working at aclub adults attend.) I voted extra for him this week in case there was a teeny backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since hedoesn't "act" gay, it probably won't matter since most people will forget, gay viewers will give himtheir support and teenage girls will love it -- this makes David Hernandez "safe" for them becausethey can lust after him without worrying about his wanting to reciprocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Johns -- I've been very negative about Michael Johns (and Luke Menard) since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And nothing tonight changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought he was just terrible on the Simple Minds hit "Don't You (Forget About Me)." Rough beginning, very rough on the key change, screaming the notes towards the end and I just wince when he lifts up the mike stand in a rock star move -- everything he does seems like a pose to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He too seemed to screw up the lyrics, though none of the judges said anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I expected them to finally blast him, but instead they all said nice things and gave him their endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Randy seemed to confuse this Scottish band Simple Minds with the Aussie group INXS -- "The Aussie boy goes home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I seem to be alone on my dislike for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe I hate him because he's pretty? He doesn't need my support if he's got all three judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook -- I haven't really been sold on David Cook yet, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Till tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did a rocked- up version of the ultimate wimp song, Lionel Richie's "Hello" and it worked triumphantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was indeed a great arrangement and I wrote in my notes that it could be a single before the judges allsaid the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His vocals were very good too, despite a little thinness on the last few wordsbefore ending solidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It really could be a hit and probably will be soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best of his by far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Myonly long-term problem is that the camera doesn't love him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He always seems to have a cocky, self-satisfied air about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He just looks pleased with himself and there's really nothing he can doabout it since it's presumably just the way he comes across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon then mentioned he bumped into Lionel Richie at a Whole Foods store, with Simon buying carrots and Richie buying cereal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan then said he didn't want to know what happened afterSimon's shopping expedition, which I took to be a veiled reference to carrots as a sex device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wasthat one of Idol's raciest moments or am I a pervert? What else could Ryan have been joking about?

So he dumps the guitar, tackles the EXTREMELY vocally challenging Leonard Cohen standard "Hallelujah" and just nails it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A simple guitar accompaniment was perfect and even better was Castro's approach to the tune: it's got a huge melodramatic vibe because of Jeff Buckley's brilliant cover (not to mention Rufus Wainwright's similarly grand treatment) but Castro kept it very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He totally lost it right before the end and smiled awkwardly but pulled it together for the final note and was really, really good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he has hidden depths I didn't suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon -- who has seemed wonderfully clueless about pop music lately -- actually knows and loves the Jeff Buckley version and points out rightly that Castro is getting better and better and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chikezie -- He changes the gender on a tune covered by Sister Sledge and (more famously) by Whitney Houston, "All The Man That I Need." Very smooth, very smooth, but almost dangerously forgettable, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't ask me why I say that because I thought he did a good job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He still hasn't had a huge moment but he's been quietly consistent and he too can get much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he makes it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta, David Hernandez, David Cook and Jason Castro are locks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges were nice to almost everyone except...Luke Menard, who is a lock to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who will go home with him? It's between Danny Noriega, Michael Johns and Chikezie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm very torn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought Michael Johns gave the worst performance, I thought Danny went too over the top on the non-singing portion of his appearance and I thought Chikezie disappeared in front of my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd loveto say Michael Johns and something tells me it's Danny but given my personal rule of choosing theworst performance and the most forgettable, I'm going to go with Luke Menard and um, uh, oh toheck with the judges, Luke Menard and Michael Johns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who did you like, who should be sent home and will Middle America be turned off by David Hernandez working as a stripper in gay bars?

David Cook really shocked me last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved his version of "Hello" and I too, will buy it on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope he didn't peak this week though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta is a excellent singer, but something about him bothers me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He seems contrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am sure he will go far, but I would like to see someone else win it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chikezie is cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He won't make it all the way, but I am enjoying him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope America sends Luke and David Hernandez home tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Rest assured, Danny Noriega is too witty a la Carson from Queer Eye For The Straight Guy not to have a future at least on TV if not in music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others agree with you about DavidHernandez, which bums me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Am I blinded by his career as an adult entertainer? mch755 See Profile I'm a Fan of mch755 permalink Pretty much agree with your assessments of the guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My favorites were:1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cook- I was raised on 80's music and danced to this song in junior high, and I almost didn'trecognize it at first! It was a great version of a really dopey song and I'm buying it on Itunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My favoriteby far of the night. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Hernandez- pretty good version of the song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wasn't super impressed but overall did a goodjob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Personally I don't care about his past as a stripper, big whoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He needed to make some moneyand he's a good looking guy, why not use what ya got? I also agree that people will forget about it and concentrate on the singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My Semi Favorite: 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Archuleta- I was surprisingly underwhelmed with little David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was ok but I wasn't wowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Forthe first time, I won't buy this on Itunes like I've done with his other 2 songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus I'm getting tired of thepuppy dog act, I mean, come on the dude's 17, not 12! He said the right things though with thehomelessness comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My Least Favorites: American Idol Celine DionDavid ArchuletaDavid HernandezFoxGayPaula AbdulPop MusicRandy JacksonReality TVSimon Cowell Stripper Style : Bonnie Fuller Michelle Obama's Lost Her Mind! 3 Reasons She's Suddenly A Fashion Disaster Style : Verena von Pfetten 7 Lessons To Be Learned From Carla Bruni Style : Verena von Pfetten Brow-O-Wow: Bushy Eyebrows Make AComeback (PHOTOS, POLL) Related Tags Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:14 AM on 03/05/2008 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:02 PM on 03/05/2008Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 16: The Men http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_89919.html [4/5/2009 7:32:50 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Comments are closed for this entry 1.Luke Menard- Poor guy, going first does no favors for a singer on this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You could tell AI said to themselves lets just put him first since he's out on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His version of a Wham song I used todance to in 7th grade was pretty sad, no pop or pizazz to it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was actually depressing, and thatsnot Wham!2.Chikizie- I actually like this guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a good singer with personality but tonight wasn't that great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iactually forgot the song he was singing after he finished, so not too memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hope he doesn't getkicked off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink When it comes to being eliminated, forgettable is more dangerous than terrible, so I'm worriedabout Chikezie going home too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's my safety pick after Luke Menard and Michael Johns. jalowe1957 See Profile I'm a Fan of jalowe1957 permalink American Idol: False Diety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And speaking of false idols, didn't the First Commandment say "You Should Have No Other Gods Before Me?"
