His big break as a producer cameon the Steve Miller Band’s debut album, Children of the Future,and he went on to engineer or produce iconic albums for the bestin the business: Abbey Road with the Beatles, Led Zeppelin’s andthe Eagles’ debuts, Who’s Next by the Who, and many others.Even more impressive, Johns was perhaps the only person on agiven day in the studio who was entirely sober, and so he is one ofthe most reliable and clear-eyed insiders to tell these stories today.In this entertaining and observant memoir, Johns takes us on atour of his world during the heady years of the sixties, withbeguiling stories that will delight music fans the world over: heremembers helping to get the Steve Miller Band released from…Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This Book Go to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site whereyou can get this book.BookFilter12/1/2015BookFilter | Evernote Web https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=0fa06898-664a-4b1b-84c9-9d092d1abbc6&amp;ses=4&amp;sh=2&amp;sds=5&amp;2/3 Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayHardcore fans of music and the bands that producer/engineer Glyn Johns worked with will enjoy rifling through thisbook and his stories of working with the Rolling Stones, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, of course the Beatles and manyothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johns is a charming, self-deprecating character who is strongest in the brief passages about his childhood.Once he gets into the music, his anecdotes do begin to run together indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he introduces Chris Blackwellof Island, Johns is sure to skim over Blackwell's career, tell how they meet, describe Blackwell as a kind man andthen run down their interactions over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the book is roughly chronological, this jumping back and forthhappens a lot and is entirely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johns is happy to weigh in on the people he didn't like -- this or thatproducer or manager or label head might be called a "little shit" and he amusingly dispatches Clive Davis by sayingno one had a higher opinion of Davis than Davis himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as for the artists, the modestly entertaining andinsightful anecdotes are surrounded by an awful lot of not terribly exciting ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You do get a glimpse of thepersonalities of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when Johns quits a Paul McCartney solo albumsession in a huff, we're left to wonder why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he's present during the sessions for "Let It Be" and GeorgeHarrison quits the band, Johns is too polite to go into details, though since the entire world knows that's when Georgequit and then was wooed back, he guesses it's okay to say that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, essentially polite and thus we are lefton the outside looking in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As for what a producer and an engineer actually does, precious little of that is described inanything but the most general terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johns does get technical very briefly when describing how he accidentallycame up with his innovative method of recording drums but that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The give and take of creativity isessentially absent here, either because he found it hard to turn into a story or felt it was too personal for the acts.Joan Armatrading was a talent he didn't appreciate at first glance, Jerry Garcia shook his hand and was so kind andso on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all blurs together unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johns is a major talent as a producer and states he came upwith the naked approach to Let It Be AND the idea that they should record a concert on the roof of Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He wasalso there when Led Zeppelin was born and Eric Clapton got his shit together and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a colorful life.Unfortunately, his talent doesn't really extend to the book-length memoir so the stories about being turned back atGermany for calling the border guard a kraut or almost missing out on the Eagles get lost amid a lot of dross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andthose looking for insight into the creative work he does and how he does it will be left wanting as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he seemslike an awfully nice guy and would surely be a blast to share drinks with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe then he'd break out the really juicystuff. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Glyn Johns was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was there at some of the most important recording sessions in Rock and Roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Readinghis book, you are standing beside him as he sets up the studio in readiness for the arrival of groups like LedZeppelin, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me it is a fantastic romp through the pages of Rock and Rollhistory.”—Sir Paul McCartney “Glyn Johns has been a very important person in my recording life (and also his brother Andy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glyn was the firstrecording engineer who helped me to understand recording and through that he was very supportive in introducingme to a lot of sessions with important people such as Ben Sidren, Leon Russell, Ronnie Lane, Pete Townshend andHowling Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This together, of course, with many of the great recordings he did with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is one of the best.”—Charlie Watts</p>
