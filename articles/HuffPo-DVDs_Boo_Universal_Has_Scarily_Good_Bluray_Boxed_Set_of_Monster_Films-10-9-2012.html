(And how easily Rains might have been stuck in horror like Vincent Price -- he's in this plus The Wolf Man and The Phantom Of The Opera ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lon Chaney Jr. is no leading man but once he's in makeup, The Wolf Man gains a certain emotional edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phantom is an overstuffed prestige pic when horror works best without delusions of grandeur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Creature From The Black Lagoon is a bit of silliness but so influential (what a wave of '50s horror flicks came in its wake) that it deserves its place in history and this collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They even include the 3-Dversion here for the first time in ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A slim, compact box (hurrah!) though I always prefer spindles tothe cardboard sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most importantly of all, you're seeing these films in top notch picture and sound,probably better than most people saw them even during their debut runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe Warner Bros. shouldhave let Universal remake Dark Shadows .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They weren't averse to jokey movies (like Abbott &amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein ) but there was always a modicum of understanding for the conventions of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's indifferent spoof of the cult TV series, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is Burton bored?He certainly seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CINDERELLA DIAMOND EDITION ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- Cinderella has always resided in the top tier of Disney films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I appreciate the beauty of the drawings but thebackgrounds are exceptionally static throughout to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not an artistic choice to create acertain look and they surely didn't turn necessity to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That keeps me from ranking thisslight tale higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They do a good job of beefing up the animal characters to flesh out the story (such asthe mice Gus and Jacques) but it's still pushing it to get to 75 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Having said all that, it's firmly inthe second tier of solid Disney films and is beautifully presented here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A terrific bonus is the short filmTangled Ever After , which not surprisingly stars the horse from Tangled, one of the great animal characters in Disney history and it's all achieved without him speaking a word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trump Announcement A Gigantic, Pointless Bust?

(Make it soon; don't drag these things out.) But my favorite is the adorkableMax Greenfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm still astonished that the bizarre mumbly drawl he created for his character inVeronica Mars was not his real speaking voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now if they'd just tone down the over the top nuttiness and keep it grounded in reality, the show would be funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they're lucky, New Girl will have some seasons as good as the best years of How I Met Your Mother , another solid comedy with a great cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They keep me tuning in every once in a while, even though I've long ago stopped caring about who thereal mother is or frankly the convoluted love lives of our leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're heartbroken that DowntonAbbey stole the thunder from the reboot of Upstairs Downstairs and you really want a fix but have already watched the original a gazillion times, well you might try Thomas &amp; Sarah .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a tepid spin-off from the original series and isn't a patch on that classic, but Pauline Collins remains a hoot, even in these lesser circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANNIE ($14.99 BluRay; Sony) -- Annie just began playing previews on Broadway and I'm excited to see it since I've never seen the show in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've only seen the pretty good 1999 TV movie starring Victor Garber and this stiff 1982 feature film edition starring Albert Finney and Carol Burnett (the best thing init).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, it's been put out on DVD in its original widescreen aspect ratio, instead of thehorribly cropped edition they released on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while it's not remastered, the Blu-ray does lookbetter than that earlier version (not a high bar, believe me, but it does look decent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So fans of the movie(especially those who want to enjoy Burnett's excellent work) have an inexpensive option now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GERHARD RICHTER PAINTING ($29.95 DVD; Kino Lorber) -- This film doesn't promise to reveal or explain Richter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not Richter Bares His Soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So you shouldn't be surprised by the alternatelyfrustrating and intriguing glimpse into his work methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I've never heard the artist talk before so I washappily surprised by his amusing comments and attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You are at a certain remove from the action,but then if you were in his studio and felt constrained about yelling out a hundred questions, this isexactly the experience you would have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's certainly compelling for those fascinated by modern art ingeneral or Richter in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The uninitiated might feel they were watching paint dry and in a sensethey'd be right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in the proper context, it turns out that can be rather absorbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extras, especiallya chat with Richter and an art historian that lasts 23 minutes, are solid.THE NIGHT RIDERS ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films) RED RIVER RANGE ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films) OVERLAND STAGE RAIDERS ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films) THREE TEXAS STEERS ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films) -- I guess there's always more to learn about Hollywood history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until these Blu-rays came out, I'd never heard of The Three Mesquiteers , a Western spin on The Three Musketeers (but minus D'Artagnan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's not surprising until you hear they made 51 of them from 1936 to 1943 and that eight of them starred John Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are four of Wayne's movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Naturally, I'd prefer they put out all eight of Wayne's flicks in one cheap set, but Olive is a small companyrescuing films from the vaults so that's just not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, these all look pretty terrific.The Night Riders is atypical because it's set not in 1939 (when it was released) but in the 1800s with the assassination of President Garfield as a plot twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hilariously, they do good in this film while donning thecostumes also worn by the KKK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No allusion is intended and there's certainly no racial subtext to the filmbut it's rather amusingly off-putting to see them help ranch hands and farmers while wearing such a vilesymbol of hatred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other three are more standard fare, with Overland featuring silent film icon Louise Brooks in her last screen appearance.They're all under an hour and only John Wayne completists or B-Western nuts need apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I'm thrilled: Since 1939 is always touted as the best year in film history, I'll watch anything made from that year and this gives me three more flicks to add to my list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE WAR OF THE ROSES SIGNATURE SERIES WALL STREET SIGNATURE SERIESTHE BROTHERS MCMULLEN SIGNATURE SERIESSHE'S THE ONE SIGNATURE SERIESTHE FRENCH CONNECTION SIGNATURE SERIES ($24.99 each BluRay; FOX) -- Five films in the Signature Series, which guarantees that the director has overseen the remastering of the film and itspresentation on Blu-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Douglas shines in Wall Street of course but his even better work in The War Of The Roses has gone unappreciated, much like the film itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a black comedy about divorce that is Danny DeVito's crowning achievement as a director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edward Burns is represented with his twobest films: his breakthrough The Brothers McMullen and his romantic drama with Jennifer Aniston, an actress who should have made the transition to film easily but somehow didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, there's WilliamFriedkin's best film by a country mile, the gritty action film The French Connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh for the days when a regular Joe like Gene Hackman could be a movie star! ***** Most titles listed here will be available in multiple formats and in multiple combinations, includingDVD, Blu-ray, digital download, video on demand, streaming and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
