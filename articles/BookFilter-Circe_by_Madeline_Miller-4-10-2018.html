This time she inhabits the character of Circe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Homer told it, Circe was a near immortal banished to an island,just one of many dangers faced down by the wily Odysseus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Circe turned his men into swine but Odysseus was forewarnedby the god Hermes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wayward warrior pressures the hag into restoring his men and then w(h)iles away a year on herisland before moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some other ancient tales say Circe even bore the warrior a son (or sons) who would later accidentally kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While it's true the adventures of Odysseus were peripatetic in the extreme, why exactly did he tally for a year on her island? And how did Circe end up banished to this spit of land in the first place? As with "The Song OfAchilles," Miller brings Circe fully to life, from an anxious childhood to the endless heartbreak, disappointment andfrustrated ambition that is surely the lot of demigods who live for thousands of years. "Circe" is gripping from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite portraying characters who have been indelibly brought to life so many times before, Miller's take on everyone from Helios to Hermes to Daedalus and Circe herself threatens to overwhelm our previous imaginings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Circe's resistance to beingpigeonholed or dismissed by her father, her embrace of "feminine" pursuits looked down on by others (like weaving andwitchcraft) and so much more make this a rich tale on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Above all, it's a thoroughly satisfying story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only thegods know what epic or ancient myth Miller might set her considerable skills to next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever it is, the story will surely be worth the wait. -- Michael Giltz What Others Say NPR's Weekend Edition "Books To Look Forward To In 2018" Esquire's "The 27 Most Anticipated Books of 2018" Boston Globe's "25 books we can't wait to read in 2018" The Millions "The Most Anticipated: The Great 2018 Book Preview" Cosmopolitan's "33 Books to Get Excited About in 2018" - "Miller follows her impressive debut ( The Song of Achilles ) with a spirited novel about Circe's evolution from insignificant nymph to formidable witch best known for turning Odysseus's sailors into swine....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weaving together Homer's tale with other sources, Miller crafts a classic story of female empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She paints anuncompromising portrait of a superheroine who learns to wield divine power while coming to understand what itmeans to be mortal."Ã¢ Publishers Weekly, Starred Review - "In her stirring follow-up to the Orange Prize-winning The Song of Achilles (2011), Miller beautifully voices the experiences of the legendary sorceress Circe...This immersive blend of literary fiction and mythological fantasydemonstrates that the Greek myths are still very relevant today."Ã¢ Booklist - "A retelling of ancient Greek lore gives exhilarating voice to a witch...
