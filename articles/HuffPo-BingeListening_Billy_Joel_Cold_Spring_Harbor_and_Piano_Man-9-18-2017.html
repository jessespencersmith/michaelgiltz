                <p>ÔÑºHuffPost ÔÑº ÔÑºÔÑºÔÑºÔÑºEDITION US Michael Giltz , Contributor BookFilter creator BingeListening Billy Joel: "Cold Spring Harbor" and "Piano Man" 09/18/2017 03:56 pm ET | Updated Sep 26, 2017 Do you love Billy Joel? Hate him? Is he overrated or under-appreciated? And no matter where you stand on this hugely popular artist, when was the last time you sat down and listened to his albums, rather than grabbing a greatest hits set or saying ‚ÄúAlexa, play Billy Joel‚Äù and letting an algorithm do your work for you? That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre BingeListening to Billy Joel : to use the latest technology of streaming so we can refocus on the classic format of the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We‚Äôll see how Billy Joel holds up after all these years and work our way from his disastrous debut Cold Spring Harbor to his graceful bow with River Of Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what better week to begin? This marks the anniversary of when Billy Joel was in the studio recording the song that would be his first taste of pop success and a signature tune he‚Äôs sung ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, Joel was in Los Angeles in 1973 recording the song ‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù on Sept 17-20 and put the final touches on it Sept 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So how does he sound today? Let‚Äôs find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add your comments at the bottom and tell us what you think? COLD SPRING HARBOR * 1/2 out of **** for recording but maybe ** out of **** for the songs Side One ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Got A Way‚Äù‚ÄúYou Can Make Me Free‚Äù BingeListening Billy Joel: "Cold Spring Harbor" and "Piano Man"ÔÑº‚ÄúEverybody Loves You Now‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy Judy Why‚ÄùSide Two‚ÄúTurn Around‚Äù‚ÄúYou Look So Good To Me‚Äù‚ÄúTomorrow Is Today‚Äù‚ÄúNocturne‚Äù‚ÄúGot To Begin Again‚ÄùBilly Joel‚Äôs debut album was a fiasco, funded on a dime and locking Joel into an onerous contract it would take him ages and all sorts of skullduggery to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the real tragedy is the recording itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due to technical incompetence and ultimately indifference, his vocals were mastered at a higher, speeded-up level that makes Joel sound like a chirpy little pre-teen, more Alvin and the Chipmunks than rock and roll. (When the problem was spotted, no one wanted to fork over the money to fix it.) Even friends gathered with Joel to celebrate his first album burst out laughing when they heard the trills of his embarrassing sounding voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel himself smashed the album to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs hard to imagine how devastating that would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it‚Äôs possible having the album sink without a trace was a blessing in disguise, a dry run for an artist who would blossom on his second turn at bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It came out in 1971 and everyone involved ‚Äî everyone but Joel, obviously ‚Äî decided he would be a soft rock troubadour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They ignored songs he‚Äôd already written, more propulsive tunes like ‚ÄúTravelin‚Äô Prayer,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Billy The Kid‚Äù and ‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù for Pete‚Äôs sake! In their place? Softer, gentler, sometimes wimpier tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel wanted to be Ray Charles or Jerry Lee Lewis (and everyone wanted to be Elvis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the masterminds of this debut wanted someone in the mold of a poor man‚Äôs James Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If things had gone a little differently and Joel had some initial success, he might have been forever handcuffed by that first impression on fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Various attempts have been made over the years to improve or fix this album, including a 1983 remix that fiddled with the pitch and overdubbed musicians, as well as later CD and LP reissues of varying quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel to my knowledge has not been involved in any of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the vocals on Cold Spring Harbor are an insurmountable obstacle to actually enjoying this album (why oh why didn‚Äôt Joel record the entire album again in concert way back then?), there‚Äôs another problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time and again, the songwriting is vague and collegiate, the mark of someone who isn‚Äôt really writing about what they‚Äôve lived but rather what they‚Äôve read about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The word play is basic ‚Äî ‚ÄúTomorrow is today,‚Äù for example, which almost sounds meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or the not-so-puzzling realization that ‚ÄúI never asked for much before, not before/ Things have changed, I need more/ Tell me why, Judy why.‚Äù And if there‚Äôs a young man in a song you can bet an old man will be coming up right behind. (Though that happens, unfortunately, on the next album.) I‚Äôm certain Joel would be more than happy to take back the opening lines of Side One closer ‚ÄúFalling Of The Rain,‚Äù which are ‚ÄúOnce upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams....‚Äù For all those youthful flaws, one thing saves Cold Spring Harbor and gives hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Song after song may have lyrics that slip by unnoticed but the melodies lodge in your brain. ‚ÄúEverybody Loves You Now‚Äù is a nasty little stinger about a guy who mocks a girl (after she rejects him, of course) and it actually rocks out. ‚ÄúYou Can Make Me Free‚Äù is way too long at more than six minutes but it too has energy to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bridge on the gospel-ish ‚ÄúTomorrow Is Today‚Äù was always a favorite moment, if only because his voice dips way down so for just a brief few seconds we hear a voice that actually sort of sounds like Billy Joel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it too, has a rolling melody we latch onto, as does the lyrically feeble ‚ÄúFalling of the Rain.‚Äù The closer ‚ÄúGot To Begin Again‚Äù has a lovely tune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel is always good at ending his albums and this one sounds worthy of Barry Manilow at his catchiest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Got A Way,‚Äù the opening track to the album which has a graceful melody for the ages (it‚Äôs one of only two Joel tunes we can call a standard) and that intriguing coda of a word. ‚ÄúI know that I can‚Äôt live without her...anyway.‚Äù That ‚Äúanyway‚Äù adds a note of uncertainty and diffidence or perhaps just resignation to the fact that it doesn‚Äôt matter if he can‚Äôt explain what he loves about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He‚Äôs caught but good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel hated the strings on the album and other touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But actually the strings on this song are restrained and quite effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here at least you get a glimpse of what‚Äôs to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cold Spring Harbor has a clutch of pretty good melodies and one song that‚Äôs a sure fire hit. (It took a live album and a new recording a decade later to make it a hit, but so what?) You wouldn‚Äôt quite bet the house on Joel based on these ten tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he got lucky with ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Got A Way‚Äù and maybe the lyrics would never get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it‚Äôs not every day you hear a standard from an unknown artist so you‚Äôd be a fool to bet against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOTE: Ok, now I‚Äôm not even sure what I listened to all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I bought this album on cassette, shook my head at the squeaky vocals and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I never bought it on CD (why would I?) and so the news of the album‚Äôs mishap and later official and unofficial ‚Äúfixes‚Äù passed me by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When I dug into Spotify, the music sounded as I remembered it all those years ago so I assumed it was the original mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nope apparently it‚Äôs the 1983 butchering by the producer that‚Äôs included there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So apparently I‚Äôve been listening to that versionfor all these years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel disavows pretty much all of them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it sure would be nice to give a listen to a version that was based on the original master tapes and done with Joel‚Äôs approval, rather than the bootlegs out there that fiddle with the playback speed of virgin vinyl copies to approximate Joel‚Äôs real voice at the top or ‚Äî worse ‚Äî the slapping on of overdubs by the producer who messed things up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PIANO MAN *** 1/2 out of **** Side One ‚ÄúTravelin‚Äô Prayer‚Äù‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Crime‚Äù‚ÄúYou‚Äôre My Home‚Äù‚ÄúThe Ballad Of Billy The Kid‚ÄùSide Two‚ÄúWorse Comes To Worst‚Äù‚ÄúStop In Nevada‚Äù‚ÄúIf I Only Had The Words (To Tell You)‚Äù‚ÄúSomewhere Along The Line‚Äù‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚ÄùWhat the heck happened? Few acts make a leap in songwriting the way Billy Joel did from his debut album to Piano Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He transformed from a fairly anonymous lyricist offering up generic ideas of love to a sharp observer of real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Suddenly Joel was drawing upon his own experience and the experience of those around him, progressing from moon-spoon-June rhymes that could be about anyone to songs filled with telling details and arresting imagery. ‚ÄúI need you in my house cause you‚Äôre my home‚Äù is a subtler play on words (and more meaningful ) than anything on Cold Spring Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Crime‚Äù he is done with fanciful pure love and stating bluntly, ‚ÄúWell, now you tell me you love somebody/ And you‚Äôll love ‚Äòem forever/ You may love ‚Äòem forever/ but you won‚Äôt like ‚Äòem all of the time.‚Äù My god, he even mentions masturbating in ‚ÄúCaptain Jack!‚Äù This is far away from the moonlit glades and true romance of yore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This leap in ability is capped by the lyrics of ‚ÄúPiano Man,‚Äù a song that folks who aren‚Äôt ardent fans of Billy Joel apparently feel they‚Äôve heard more than enough, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs filled with good lines, like the old man ‚Äúmaking love to his tonic and gin‚Äù or the bartender who starts to bemoan life ‚Äúas a smile ran away from his face.‚Äù Oh, you know the lines even if you don‚Äôt want to, don‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs observant, pungent, lived-in and understandably gave Joel his first Top 40 hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The album begins with ‚ÄúTravelin‚Äô Prayer, ‚Äú a terrific road song powered by a banjo of all things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The country influence is partly due to the session musicians playing on the album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But if you‚Äôre confused as to why Joel is singing ‚ÄúThe Ballad Of Billy The Kid‚Äù (not to mention Steely Dan also drawing upon imagery of the Old West and even Elton John going country and imagining himself fixing up a barn!), keep in mind that acts of the 1970s grew up surrounded by Westerns on TV and at the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean literally surrounded, with sometimes most of the Top 10 shows in the late 1950s and early 1960s being in that genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Western was part of the landscape, even for a kid born in the Bronx. ‚ÄúTravelin‚Äô Prayer‚Äù kicks things off very well; gone is the balladeer of the first, mostly unheard album and here is Billy Joel pounding out a tune on the piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs so good that Dolly Parton covered it on her excellent bluegrass album The Grass Is Blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when one of the best songwriters of all time covers your tune, you‚Äôre doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs followed by ‚ÄúPiano Man.‚Äù Everyone can identify with longing for something more, which may explain the song‚Äôs enduring appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this isn‚Äôt a dive bar and the cast of characters aren‚Äôt lovable losers a la Tom Waits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They‚Äôre not the lowlifes just this side of the law you‚Äôll find in Bruce Springsteen or the literary archetypes peopled in Bob Dylan‚Äôs world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They‚Äôre folks stopping for a drink on the way home to their families or businessmen looking for a little company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Joel sings, ‚ÄúYes they‚Äôre sharing a drink they call loneliness/ But it‚Äôs better than drinking alone.‚Äù But that businessman has a job, as does the guy who sells real estate and pretty much everyone else. (Of course, a ‚Äúreal estate novelist‚Äù turns out to be a guy who works in real estate but dreams of writing the Great American Novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always imagined it was a guy who made up fanciful descriptions of his dodgy properties, like swamp land in Florida or maybe a ‚Äúcozy‚Äù one bedroom which means it has just enough room for you to stretch out your arms and touch the walls.) They‚Äôre not barflies, just people getting by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think this is key to recognizing Joel‚Äôs unique territory for his songs: suburbia, regular folk who work 9 to 5 and pay the mortgage and raise their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It ain‚Äôt romantic or larger than life; they‚Äôre not born to run though they might jog every once in a while, god help ‚Äòem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People love to imagine overpowering romance or grand escapes and a lot of pop songs offer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel just offers them a glimpse of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Artists will always celebrate the gritty excitement of the big city or the wholesome appeal of the small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sure, plenty of folk from Merle Haggard on down will speak up for the common man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But suburbia? The folks who live in Queens and the Bronx or in suburbs all over the country? If it‚Äôs mentioned at all, suburbia is a symbol of conformity and boredom ‚Äî a straitjacket you should struggle against. ‚ÄúPiano Man‚Äù is the first glimmer that regular people with everyday lives would be his turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sure, the song borders on a little self-pitying or self-aggrandizing. (‚ÄùMan, what are you doing here?‚Äù) But most of the characters are right where they belong and Joel backs up his boast with a tune and chorus that had everyone singing along by the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may be tired of ‚ÄúPiano Man,‚Äù but it‚Äôs a great song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The album has plenty more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Listen to Piano Man with fresh ears and what‚Äôs interesting is how little he repeats himself stylistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Country, rock, soft rock, singer-songwriter, a little soul ‚Äî it‚Äôs all here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The female backup singers on ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Crime‚Äù and other tracks add a very welcome color to the sound, one he didn‚Äôt use much in the years to come. ‚ÄúWorse Comes To Worst‚Äù also benefits from the slinky arrangement of vocals and instruments as well as its intriguing drawn-from-real-life line ‚ÄúI know a woman in New Mexico.‚Äù It‚Äôs the perfect detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Cold Spring Harbor, we knew what every line meant but it wasn‚Äôt very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here, we can only guess who that woman is (lover? friend?), but it‚Äôs a lot more fun to wonder about and we buy the idea ‚Äî this guy has options of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ballad ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Got A Way‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a fluke either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel was eager to rock out and show what he could do, but that didn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôd throw away a good slow number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first album became soggy by the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But surrounded by rockers and upbeat tunes, the quiet songs sound all the better here. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre My Home‚Äù is a lovely one inspired by Joel‚Äôs trek across country to hide out in LA until he could get out of his first record deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs also inspired by the fact that he couldn‚Äôt afford a gift for his girlfriend, so a song would have to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And ‚ÄúIf I Only Had The Words (To Tell You)‚Äù manages the nice trick of declaring his love by sheepishly pretending he‚Äôd never find the right lines to express what he feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can hear the bigger budget Columbia offered thanks to the Copland-esque orchestral scoring on ‚ÄúThe Ballad Of Billy The Kid.‚Äù It‚Äôs a satisfying if atypical song for him, a portrait of the famous outlaw undercutting his fame by pointing out that Billy the Kid died alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then Joel undercuts the grand sweep of the song entirely by cheekily referencing his own life, swapping out the six-guns of an outlaw for a six-pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The un-lived, I-read-it-in-a-book nature of the first album‚Äôs lyrics only pop up here and there, mainly the fleeting (and forced) reference to Coleridge in the otherwise straightforward ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre More Home‚Äù and the unconvincing scene-setting of ‚ÄúSomewhere Along The Line,‚Äù where he sings ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a rainy night in Paris/ And I‚Äôm sitting by the Seine.‚Äù Most of it is much better than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I especially like ‚ÄúStop In Nevada,‚Äù a song about a woman escaping an unhappy marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That stop in Nevada is for a divorce of course, but beyond that who knows what the future holds? As the song says, ‚ÄúAnd she doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs comin‚Äô/ But she sure knows what she‚Äôs leavin‚Äô behind.‚Äù And think about the people in his songs. (I won‚Äôt call them characters because they‚Äôre not larger than life the way characters in songs can become.) In ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt No Crime,‚Äù our hero is a guy who drank too much and fell asleep on the floor. ‚ÄúAnd then your lady comes and finds you a sleepin‚Äô / Starts into weeping ‚Äòbout the hours you been keeping/ And you better get your ass out the door.‚Äù They‚Äôve fought before and they‚Äôll fight again, you‚Äôre certain. ‚ÄúWorse Comes To Worst‚Äù is about a guy with few obligations and fewer worries, though even he knows he better have a backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The raucous album closer is ‚ÄúCaptain Jack,‚Äù not a song I‚Äôve ever been a fan of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now back in the days of cassettes and eight tracks and eventually compact discs (never vinyl, my loss) I was not one for skipping tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My sister Libet might demand I fast forward through a song if it was too slow ‚Äî and that meant anything less than fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she was the driver and so fast forward I would...yet it seemed rude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even today, I would no more skip over a track on an album than I‚Äôd skip a chapter in a novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She probably had me skip ‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù a fair amount of times (‚ÄùPut on Glass Houses! ‚Äù) and if honest I‚Äôd admit I didn‚Äôt mind so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a long time I thought the phrase ‚ÄúCaptain Jack‚Äù meant masturbation (which he mentions in the song) rather than heroin and that amused/scandalized my Catholic boy self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the comedown of the would be hipsters (‚ÄùBut still your finger‚Äôs gonna pick your nose‚Äù) felt a little crude, a little obvious to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the music sounded too grandiose for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn‚Äôt have said why but now that I listen to it again and think about who Billy Joel is singing about (and to whom he‚Äôs singing), it‚Äôs clearer to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This isn‚Äôt a song about outcasts and punks; it‚Äôs about the suburban wannabes who do a little sightseeing on the wild side and then catch the last train home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So why all the angst? Springsteen would have been right at ease among the losers and dreamers and punks of Greenwich Village observed in this track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Billy Joel‚Äôs bridge and tunnel characters gawk at the spectacle, get a little reflected rebellious glory...and then head right back home again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, they‚Äôre doing some hard drugs (the heroin referenced in the title), but you get the sense it‚Äôs just a taste of someone else‚Äôs life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the vicarious fun of taking a peek at the nuttiness on display will end soon for most and be replaced by marriage and work and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other artists celebrate the lure of the open highway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Joel knows that isn‚Äôt real life for most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He writes, ‚ÄúSo you decide to take a holiday/ You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet/ Ah, but there‚Äôs no place to go anyway/ And what for....‚Äù In other words, run away? Are you nuts? They‚Äôve got rent to pay and a girlfriend and they might get a promotion in a couple of months (or years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs not a thrilling life for the folks who stop by the bar on their way home in ‚ÄúPiano Man.‚Äù But it‚Äôs life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They‚Äôre not trapped in suburbia; they choose it because there‚Äôs more room for the kids and maybe a dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Escape? To what? Anywhere you go, the rent is going to be due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It‚Äôs not a glamorous world filled with spectacle and daring and big dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it‚Äôs their life, the life most people lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel celebrates it like few others, without condescension or irony and I think that‚Äôs why his fanbase is so passionate and enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The album Piano Man wasn‚Äôt a big seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would take five albums, a lot of touring and some good luck before he finally broke through for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this album gave him a clutch of songs that provided the backbone for his concerts for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone intrigued by the even lower-charting Streetlife Serenade or the blink and you missed it Turnstiles , anyone who heard good things and saw him in concert eventually bought Piano Man and was happily surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Without that remarkable leap in songwriting and a much more muscular sound, Joel might have faded into obscurity before he even began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It almost happened anyway but Piano Man was a life preserver, the source of six or seven very good songs and one or two great ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel marked out his territory ‚Äî middle class people, working folk without the halo of nobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were getting by and that was enough and Billy Joel sang about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So tell us what you think?
