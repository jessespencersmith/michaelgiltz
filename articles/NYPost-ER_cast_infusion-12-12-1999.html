                <p>TVSundav .,'------------------------------ By MICHAEL GllTZ l1e fifth season of "ER" was the first weak one in the show's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departure of George Clooney was the big news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that wouldn't have seemed so worrying if the people left behind weren't saddled with episodes more suited to a daytime soap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noah Wyle's Carter ogling Lucy Knight's underwear and Anthony Edward's Mark Greene facing stalker Mare Winningham were just two ill-advised plot twists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since this season meant the end of the road for Julianna Margulies and Gloria Reubens, "ER" seemed headed for a sad, slow decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But like other truly great shows -"All in the Family," "M*A*S*H," "Law &amp; Order" -"ER" has manÂ­ aged to reinvent itself with a batch CHARACTER: Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cle'o Finch AGE:S3 of new characters and returning favorites. "ER" has always been about the doctors more than the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if we think we know how they're always going to behave, the show dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These new characters change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're slowly being fleshed out, but just their addition to the ER makes every incoming case a batÂ­ tleground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Old favorites want to maintain their turf; newcomers want to show they've got what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike a soap, these additions to the cast aren't villains or heroesÂ­ just new people with new ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They add a little danger, a little sex appeal and a lot of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here are four scene-stealers who make "ER" worth watching again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOMETOWN: Evansville, , TV movie: set for February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indiana, where Michele was a .
