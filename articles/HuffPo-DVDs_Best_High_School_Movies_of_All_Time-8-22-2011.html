episodes of God and Politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Originally broadcast in the 1980s, it's a welcome reminder that religion and politics have been mixing since our nation's founding and that listening can still provide some insight asto what is truly motivating someone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Substantial bonuses include a 2006 Moyers documentary aboutevangelicals embracing Bible-based environmentalism, and related segments from his much-missed TV series Now with Bill Moyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An unexpected look at faith comes from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who delivers one of the sexiest and yet respectful looks at Christianity in Leon Morin, Priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean-Paul Belmondo is the seriously attractive priest in a small town in Nazi-occupied France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His confessional is bursting at the seams with local women who want some quality time, none more so than Emmanuelle Riva, a widow who doesn't even really believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Thorn Birds this isn't, but the movie clearly savors the sexual tension as the widow is slowly drawn into embracing her faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presented withthe usual care by Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BIG LEBOWSKI LIMITED EDITION ($29.98 on BluRay; Focus Features) -- The Coen Brothers' much-loved cult comedy comes to BluRay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has been packaged and repackaged so many timesthat the handful of new extras are nice but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you already own the movie, they're no reasonto fork out more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the other hand, the movie has never looked great on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BluRay isdefinitely an improvement if not definitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This surely is the role that Jeff Bridges should have won hisfirst Oscar for (if not earlier).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of course, the Academy Awards look down on comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bridges wouldhave been a much better winner than Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bridges wasn't even nominated that year, with the Oscars dominated by the usual brooding performances, in this case TomHanks for Saving Private Ryan, Ian McKellen for Gods and Monsters, Nick Nolte in Affliction and Edward Norton in American History X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Celebrity Film TV Video Weird Animals Astronomy Food Fashion Scott Brown Buy a link here Sponsored Links Hyatt Summerfield Suites® All Suites Hotel with a Full Kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Free Breakfast &amp; Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Book Now Hyatt.com/SummerfieldSuites What is Scientology Think For Yourself and Find Out for Yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientology.org Online Masters Degrees AA, BA, BS, MA, MS, PhD Programs www.DegreePath.com MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Miss Universe Is Fixed By Donald Trump: Choreographer PHOTOS: Johnny Depp Gets Creepy Like 2K sarah_ross RetweetDear Twitter Friends pls check this out: Have We Overlooked the Most Effective Way to Prevent Terrorism &amp; War?

Precious few I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps only 60 Minutes in the US still does substantial profiles of artists and other pieces that will standthe test of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And even those are usually only 20 minutes long at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what a treat it is to dive intothis collection from Omnibus, the cultural program that aired mostly on CBS in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High brow? Itdidn't even have commercials most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hosted by Alistair Cooke (and a training ground for DonHewitt of 60 Minutes), this show encompassed everything from excerpts from operas and musicals toadaptations of short stories and documentaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This all too short set contains two DVDs and more than6 hours of programming, including everything from profiles and chats with Frank Lloyd Wright andWilliam Faulkner to pieces with Pearl Buck, James Thurber and Leonard Bernstein to looks at the NewYork Times, Grand Central and "Doctor Seuss Explores The Museum That Ought To Be." Great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Satyajit Ray's The Music Room is not merely a time capsule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a moving drama about an aristocrat desperately trying to keep up appearances and a vanishing way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The heart of his world is the music room and like with Omnibus , fans can savor glimpses of some of the top musicians of India when this movie was made in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Copious extras include a feature length documentary about Ray, video from aroundtable interview including Ray, a chat with his biographer and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DARK DAYS ($34.99; Oscilloscope) -- Omnibus would have been proud to devote an entire episode to this 84 minute documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Marc Singer reveals the bizarre, unexpected society of homelesspeople who have carved out a life for themselves inside abandoned train tunnels deep beneath New YorkCity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shot in black and white by the homeless people themselves along with Singer (who spent six yearsworking on the film), it's a true original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Extras include Singer returning to the tunnels 10 years later tosee what has happened to the residents of this parallel world.HIGH AND LOW ($39.95 on BluRay; Criterion) -- This corker of a thriller is one of director Akira Kurosawa's best non-samurai movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toshiro Mifune is the wealthy businessman who just wants to make high quality shoes for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When his child is kidnapped, everything in his world is threatened --he'll either lose control of his company and throw his family into eternal debt or lose his child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based onan Ed McBain novel, half the film focuses on Mifune and half on the seedy underworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlightsinclude a stunning train sequence, many fascinating glimpses of the Japanese police force and a tone ofrighteous anger about kidnapping that even reportedly convinced Japan to strengthen its too-lenient lawsfor abducting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BluRay looks smashing and duplicates all the fine extras from the DVD,including a substantial documentary about the making of this film and a rare video chat with Mifune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY ($29.95; Lorber) -- True, it's not like reality TV was invented with The Real World -- it's been around since TV began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And navel-gazing books and films have been around sincepen was put to paper and film loaded in a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, this oddball 1967 mockumentary by Jim McBridefeels awfully prescient as it shows David collapsing in on himself as his girlfriend gets bored with himand he's soon reduced to peeking at neighbors and staring at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dead-on satire, this DVD releasealso contains three bonus shorts by McBride, who went on to make the fun drama The Big Easy, but also made a horrific remake of Breathless and a TV biopic of Meat Loaf and must have said to himself, "Whatthe heck happened here?"
