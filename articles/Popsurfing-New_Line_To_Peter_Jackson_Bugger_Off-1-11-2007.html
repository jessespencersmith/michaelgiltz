                <p>T H U R S D AY, J A N U A RY 1 1 , 2 0 0 7New Line To Peter Jackson: Bugger OffI assumed the massive amounts of money to be made would smooththings over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But New Line's Bob Shaye feels personally insulted byPeter Jackson's lawsuit and says Jackson will NEVER make "TheHobbit" or any movie at New Line as long as Shaye is around. (LOTRfans immediately begin buying voodoo dolls and trying to get steal alock of hair from Shaye.) Shaye told the SciFi Channel per the BBC:"He's got a quarter of a billion dollars paid to him so far,justifiably, according to contract, completely right."And this guy... turns around without wanting to have adiscussion with us and sues us and refused to discuss it unlesswe just give in to his plan."I don't want to work with that guy any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why would I? Sothe answer is he will never make any movie with New LineCinema again while I'm still working at the company."Ironically, it's the fact the Jackson and everyone has made so muchmoney that makes me assume he must feel really cheated to botherwith a lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And naturally, since every film studio since thebeginning of time has cooked the books and tried to hold back profits,my sympathies were with Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this is terrible news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nextquestion is whether Ian McKellen and the others would sign onWITHOUT Jackson aboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's nothing yet on McKellen's website.UPDATE: Here is Jackson's measured, professional response, perHollywood Reporter:In response, Jackson issued a statement Tuesday that did notattack Shaye but aimed at clarifying his issue with New Line.Jackson said the lawsuit stems from the studio's refusal toaccount for financial anomalies that surfaced from a partialaudit of "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" andthat is has denied his repeated requests to audit "The TwoTowers" and "The Return of the King.""Fundamentally, our legal action is about holding New Line toits contractual obligations and promises," Jackson said. "It isregrettable that Bob has chosen to make it personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I havealways had the highest respect and affection for Bob and othersenior management at New Line and continue to do so."Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: New Line To Peter Jackson: Bugger Offhttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-line-to-peter-jacks... 1 of 37/28/09 12:40 AMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SAaronBiboyMichael in New York POPSURFING.COM: New Line To Peter Jackson: Bugger Offhttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-line-to-peter-jacks... 2 of 37/28/09 12:40 AMPOPSURFING.COM: New Line To Peter Jackson: Bugger Offhttp://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-line-to-peter-jacks... 3 of 37/28/09 12:40 AM</p>
