Hoofer Savion Glover brings his unique tap style to Hadem's legendary Apollo Theater next Sunday.BY MICHAEL GIIJTZ N $ e is arguably the dancer most responsible N $ for keeping the tap tradition alive, yet ffi Savion Glover never saw some of the leg- N $ endaryhooferswho graced the stage of the N N Apollo Theater. "I didn't have the chance," says Glove4 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's probably because he was too busy making dance history himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Newark native debuted on Broadway at the age of 10 in "The Tap Dance Kid," became one of the youngest performers ever nominated for a Tony - at l5 - in "Black and Blue," and starred in the landmark, Tony-winning "Bring in'da Noise, Bring in'da Funk" in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, Gloverbrings his unique, urban- ized style of tap to the Apollo in Harlem with "Bare Soundz," an improvisational performance featur- ing him, two other dancers and gospel singer lori Ann Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part of the Apollo Family Series (with tickets priced at $12), it's Glover's latest effort to share his life-long passion for tap with a younger generation. "It's been l0 years since'Noise/Funk,'and I think the dance has remained visible," says Glover. "We've obviously done something to make peoplestop saying that this is a dyrng art form, orthat 'You've brung back tap dancing.' I don't hear those types of things anymore." Though Glover appeared on "Sesame Street" throughout the early 1990s and wrote a biogra- phy in 2000 titled "Savion! My Life in Tap" that was geared toward young people, probably his biggest impact on kids came when he choreographed and "danced" the role of Mumble in the 2006 animated hit "HappyFeet." "It was cool," says Glover of the movie, about a tap-dancing penguin who saves his colony through his unique talent. "I didn't know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But after I got used to it, it was just tunny." His next goal is to open a dance school at the Newark Community School of the Arts, which he attended as a child. "I'm continuing the educational process of get- ting people to accept dance as music," he says. "I'm going to be taking my production company there, and also my tap school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We won't otferballet or jazz or hip hop, or anything like that. "We will deal with just the art form known to me as hoofing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's going to be my planet over there," adds Glover. "It's going to be, like, Savion World." &lt;)</p>
