                <p>PlalleJ, TraillJ and' Allto1llobileJ has arrived on schedule for these deregulated times, This John Hughes comedy about a businessman with tr,wel difficulties is being released today across the nation by P"r,,­ mount Pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They held a screening and press confe­ rence earlier this month in Hollyw(xxl to promote the movie nnd-quite fittingly- I missed my flight from Gaines­ ville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But life hadn't finished imi­ tating art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a phalanx of television cameras lined the press room, reporters from across the country sat with tape recorders in hand, waiting for eve MaTtin, John Gndy and Hughes to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As they soon f(iund out; Gn­ dy's flight had been delayed because of b-Jd weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studio executives found their carefully --"~"--'estrated media event bam­ boozled by the very same problem Hughes had ,mined so well in his film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After several hours of delay, the decidedly friendly question­ ing began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The affair t(xlk place in a sound stage on tbe Para­ mount Studios lot, and anyone who fears more time and crea­ tivity is spent promoting a movie than actually lIIdkillg it would not have had their fears allayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage had been con­ verted into a mock airport ter­ ~inal complete with unifor~ed dows overlooking a runway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only thing "missing" was the luggage, and they probably arranged to have that sent to Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though his first major triumphs were sCripts for sueh "adult" movies as NlllionJ LJlIIpmm's VdCdtiml and Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; M(}lII, the label-hungry press has tagged-him a "teen" director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it's true thllt P/t4JleS is the first time Hughes has w(~ pid:l a cast com­ posed'(,f adults, and he isn'r above poking fun at how he is perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked why he chose Martin and' Candy, Hughes said, "They were forced on me by the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were looking for Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson." No one forcedJohn Candy to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He clearly looked thrilled just to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In films like S'IIIIII/('/" I?ell/,d and Art1,i?(r,mc/ DlIllgemll.r, he appeared to be trapped in the "Jolly John Candy" character that first made him famous on SCTVand in Sp/dxh.lt was difficult to tell whether he was incapable of more or just never given the opportunity. ~NEs?TRAINS ONn 1IIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHllllllIUIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIUIIIIHIHIII Now it's crystal clear, for Plane .• is his ,chance to playa Real Character and Candy makes the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin and Hughes praise his ptrformance, with Martin calling it "his best work ever." But Candy remains modest, citing the script as the important ingredient ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now it's crystal dear, for Plune.1" is his \ chance to plilY. a Real Character and Candy makes the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin and Hughes praise his ~rformance, with Martin calling it "his best work ever." But Candy remains modest, citing the script as the important ingredient ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, not everything has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a Japanese r~porter began a question directed to -Candy by saying, "The Japanese are a small people and we are great admirers of men of large size," he adopted a God-I'm­ macho pose and said in a deep, burly voice, "Why thank you," ahd the entire-room of reporters burst into laughter. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paramount hopes tbe laughter will conti­ nue this Thanksgiving and Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If'S the most successful studio in Hollywo&lt;xl, blessed witWmajor st'ars like Tom Cruise and a magic touch: Its current blockbuster is Futul.AttructiD1l , a thriller abOut infidelity that came out of left field to dominate the box office for the last twO months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tnis is not something a studio with Baed), Hil!'r Cop /I and The U11IrJ1(chu/;/eJ under its belt needed, but that's what hap­ pens when you're on a roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paramount would like to keep on rolling into the new year with two major releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first is Rafl', a concert film starring Eddie Murphy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Filmed d!lring his expletive­ and audience-filled comedy tour, Rdll' is certain to draw a huge adult audience . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PldneJ was seen as the wholesome, family-oriented round in their double­ barrelled cinematic shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the fin­ ished pnxluct delivered by Hughes certainly fits the bill: It's a sweet, sentimental tale . with nary a trace of nudity or violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, it came. wrapped in an "R" rating, courresy of the Motion Picture Ass{xiation of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This undeserved ruling hinges on a crucial scene in which Martin's characrer urrers "the 'f' word." "But only 19 times," he says with mock indignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the scene, Neal Page has finally cracked under the frustrating problems he's borne so silenrly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The normally unflappable businessman begins lashing our hke a 'loose cable, berating an innocent car rental agent in an arrempt co get transporration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unquestionably one of the funniest ~oments in the movie, and it is also quite unoffensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hughes notes that he had "no intentions of being controversial." Martin concurs, stressing that it was not gratuitous and very much "the culminations of this character's frustrations," Paramount IS probably frustrated at hav­ ing their nice little movie slapped with an "R" rating and it's hard to imagine a better candidate for "~G-13" than PI.J1lf!.f.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, this controversy probably will be seen as only a minor annoyance a few weeks from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the formidable marketing of the studio, the comoined draw of Steve' Martin and John Hughes and the film's very real audience appeal, Pla1Zf!.f should enjoY'a healthy success. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Appropriately, Hughes is now prepping the release of Shf!·.f Hat'i1lg A. 8db)', a' comedy about a young couple with a child on the way, which stars Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern. ' It's appropriate because the movie was originally scheduled to appear on screens ,in the spring of '87,but was delayed time anp again amid the inevit­ able rumors of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hughes insists that they aren't true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He says he is "thrilled" that Paramount was willing to let him wait until next _year, because the two-week lag between the end of filming on Bab)' and the starting of PI" Ilf!.r didn't give him' enough time to properly deal with the final editing and scoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has promised them a delivery date and they have tentatively set a release for early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Paramount should know better. than anyone not to expect Rd))' to arrive on time.</p>
