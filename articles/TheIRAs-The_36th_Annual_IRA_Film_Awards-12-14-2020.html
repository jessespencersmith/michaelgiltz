                <p>Newer Post Older PostMONDAY, MARCH 28, 2011 The IRAs 2011 -- "A Prophet," "I Am Love" and "Carlos" Top Winner s! THE 36TH ANNUAL IRA FILM AWARDS The IRA Film Awards are the most prestigious, mysterious and exclusive movie awards in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long after the frenzy of "awards season" has passed, the members of the IRAs meet to soberly discuss, debate, argue, bicker, fight, and mock each other as they decide what truly are the best films, performances and technical achievements of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They also shine a light on some of the worst achievements in cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The IRAs were founded in the 1970s with one very simple thought: we've got better taste than those other award shows; let's do our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And thus the IRAs were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its ranks have contained future Oscar winners, acclaimed and best-selling authors of both fiction and nonfiction (especially movie history), power players in the studio system, influential members of the media, hardcore cineastes and the team behind Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards, the most acclaimed (really, the ONLY acclaimed) awards book in history and the template for all the ones that followed in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Usually composed of 10-20 members, the IRAs spend their year watching and debating the movies that really matter, the ones they hope will last and then share their judgment with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "kids" -- younger members who joined in the 90s and the noughts - - have brought a new-found appreciation for animation and genres like sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The veterans remain loyal to stalwarts like Alain Resnais and the late, lamented Blake Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After decades, it's only natural the IRAs mellow as an institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members have been born since the IRAs began; others have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many see each other only once a year on awards night when the winners are selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The debate has softened from rancorous and bitter to witty and pointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eventually, someone's opinion on film becomes so familiar to you that instead of anger you feel amusement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was certainly the case this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; References to everything from Toy Story 3 to Wild Grass to Inception and A Prophet brought scorn from some, but it was a scorn more focused on scoring points with a witty rejoinder than the acrimonious debates that once ended friendships over the work of Blake Edwards or Brian DePalma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A love of movies always comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's put it this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the door prizes was a Criterion Collection DVD of Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Circle Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To win the prize, three people were vying to be the first to name one of the best films of the 1990s as cited on an IRA member's list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One person immediately won by shouting out "L.A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Confidential! " But another competitor was clearly still thinking hard about his answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When told he'd already lost, he said distractedly, "Well, I was going to start by telling you MY favorite film from the 1990s, which is Krzysztof Kieslowski's Red...." Even when a prize is at stake, voicing your opinion on the movies that matter always comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four films dominated every single award, so you'll find it easy to check out the taste of the IRAs this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But after the winners, we'll show the entire winning ballots so you can see the range of films that were favored by at least some factions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll discover 29 movies well worth your time, for one reason or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to some of us. (Others may vehemently disagree.) After that, you'll find a list of all the award winners in IRA history from 1975 to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So without further ado, this year's top winners are... 2010 IRA Film Award Winners Best Picture: A Prophet/Un Prophete Best Director: Jacques Audiard - A Prophet/Un Prophete Best Actor: Edgar Ramirez - Carlos Best Actress: Tilda Swinton - I Am Love Best Supporting Actor: Niels Arestrup - A Prophet/Un Prophete Best Supporting Actress: Dale Dickey - Winter's Bone Best Screenplay: Thomas Bidegain and Jacques Audiard - A Prophet/Un Prophete Best Cinematography: Yorick Le Saux - I Am Love Best Production Design: Francesca Balestra Di Mottola - I Am Love Best Music: John Adams - I Am Love Best Costumes: Antonella Cannarozzi - I Am Love Sominex: Cairo Time Dramamine: Black Swan Mechanical Actor: Vincent Cassel for Black Swan Mechanical Actress: Natalie Portman for Black Swan The Governor Scott Walker Award For Achievement In Political Thuggery: Waiting For "Superman" FILMS CITED BY THE IRAS FOR 2010 IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER Alice In Wonderland (1 mention) Anton Chekhov's The Duel (1 mention) Carlos (8 mentions) Dogtooth (1 mention) Eccentricities Of A Blonde-haired Girl (4 mentions) Everyone Else (2 mentions) The Fighter (1 mention) The Ghost Writer (5 mentions) Hadewijch (1 mention) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (2 mentions) Howl (1 mention) I Am Love (6 mention) I Love You, Philip Morris (1 mention) The Kids Are All Right (1 mention) The King's Speech (3 mentions) Night Catches Us (1 mention) Nora's Will (1 mention) 127 Hours (1 mention) Please Give (2 mentions) A Prophet/Un Prophete (7 mentions) Secret Sunshine (2 mentions) Shutter Island (1 mention) The Social Network (3 mentions) The Strange Case Of Angelica (4 mentions) The Town (1 mention) Toy Story 3 (1 mention) Vincere (6 mentions) White Material (5 mentions) Winter's Bone (5 mentions) FILMS CITED BY THE IRAS FOR 2010 IN ORDER OF MENTIONS Carlos (8 mentions) A Prophet/Un Prophete (7 mentions) I Am Love (6 mention) Vincere (6 mentions) The Ghost Writer (5 mentions) White Material (5 mentions) Winter's Bone (5 mentions) Eccentricities Of A Blonde-haired Girl (4 mentions) The Strange Case Of Angelica (4 mentions) The King's Speech (3 mentions) The Social Network (3 mentions) Everyone Else (2 mentions) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (2 mentions) Please Give (2 mentions) Secret Sunshine (2 mentions) Alice In Wonderland (1 mention) Anton Chekhov's The Duel (1 mention) Dogtooth (1 mention) The Fighter (1 mention) Hadewijch (1 mention) Howl (1 mention) I Love You, Philip Morris (1 mention) The Kids Are All Right (1 mention) Night Catches Us (1 mention) Nora's Will (1 mention) 127 Hours (1 mention) Shutter Island (1 mention) The Town (1 mention) Toy Story 3 (1 mention) THE COMPLETE BALLOTS IN ORDER OF VOTING BEST COSTUMES 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

She received six out of 10 possible votes for first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When this occurs, a vote is taken whether to accept it as the top winner by acclamation or reject it completely from the ballot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I Am Love was declared the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Balloting continued just to clarify other films that were appreciated this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When someone is honored for their work on multiple films, all films are cited in alphabetical order unless a consensus emerges to eliminate one or more particular films from the honor roll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Dante Ferretti - Shutter Island 18 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marco Dentici - Vincere 14 pts. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Albrecht Konrad - The Ghost Writer (tie) Francois-Renaud Labarthe - Carlos (tie) Mark White - Please Give (tie) Winter's Bone (tie) 11 pts. each Here you have a three-way tie for fourth place, with Konrad honored for his work on Roman Polanksi's The Ghost Writer, Labarthe for his work on Carlos and Mark White for his work on two films, Please Give and Winter's Bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yorick Le Saux - I Am Love 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yves Cape - White Material Hadewijch 15 pts. for his work on both films 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yorick Le Saux and Denis Lenoir - Carlos 14 pts. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daniele Cipri - Vincere (tie) Sabine Lancelin - Eccentricities Of A Blonde-haired Girl The Strange Case Of Angelica (tie) 12 pts. each This was a contentious award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carlos was originally a miniseries but shown at the Cannes Film Festival and theaters around the world as one lengthy five hour film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yorick Le Saux worked on the miniseries along with Denis Lenoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Le Saux also worked on I Am Love, one of the most ravishing films of the year on a technical level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some felt that Le Saux should have received the top award for his work on both films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since he shared credit on Carlos , that had to be treated separately from his work on I Am Love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SCREENPLAY 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas Bidegain and Jacques Audiard - A Prophet/Un Prophete 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olivier Assayas and Dan Franck and Daniel Leconte - Carlos (tie) Debra Granik &amp;

Dale Dickey - Winter's Bone 20 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maria Paiato - I Am Love 15 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aggeliki Papoulia - Dogtooth (tie) Nora Van Waldstatten - Carlos (tie) 13 pts. each 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helena Bonham Carter - Alice In Wonderland Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 The King's Speech (tie) Ann Guilbert - Please Give (tie) Olivia Williams - The Ghost Writer (tie) 9 pts. each Here again we have some ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two actresses tied at #3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there's a three-way tie at #5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helena Bonham Carter appeared in three films this year, but no consensus emerged on which films she deserved notice for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One loved her work in Alice but derided The King's Speech .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another loved The King's Speech but didn't see Alice .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A third obstinately said her work in HP7P1 was her best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus, her appearance on the honor roll includes all three films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Niels Arestrup - A Prophet/Un Prophete 27 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pierce Brosnan - The Ghost Writer 21 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Black Swan was easily the most disliked notable film of 2010, winning three of four of the negative awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But special notice was taken of Waiting For "Superman" by the IRA crowd, which leans strongly left in its politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because they saw the film as a screed against teachers' unions (the film paints unions as virtually the reason public schools are failing; teachers' unions are the major, indeed the only villain), IRA members found it strange the movie was embraced by liberal Hollywood and felt it needed to be singled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They awarded the film a rare, special citation, as follows: THE GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER AWARD FOR ACHIEVEMENT IN POLITICAL THUGGERY JURY CITATION GOES TO WAITING FOR "SUPERMAN." MECHANICAL ACTRESS 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natalie Portman - Black Swan 39 pts. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patricia Clarkson - Cairo Time 14 pts. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angelina Jolie - Salt and The Tourist
