We meant 16!” AMC executives are probably kicking themselves for their caution in green-lighting just six episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Season 2 will have 13 — but no word yet on how soon they’ll be able to start filming. 2 How big can it get? Despite all the nice things critics have written, “MadMen” and “Breaking Bad” score CW-likeaudiences — just under 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So, AMC may have just found its “Sopranos” — a critical and commercial triumph.Because the audiences for “Mad Men”and “The Sopranos” tripled and evenquadrupled over three or four seasons, AMC should have its heart set on growing “The Walking Dead” into a cableblockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten million viewers aweek? At least. 3 How much violence can people stomach? “The Walking Dead” didn’t pull any punches in the first two episodes.Along with smearing zombie innards all over our hero and draping intestines around his neck, they showed lawmanRick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) gunningdown a little girl zombie in the very firstscene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creator Frank Darabont (“The Shawshank Redemption”) said at New More Print Sponsored Links Mom’s Dirty Secret EXPOSED Mom Reveals For The First Time How She Makes $87/Hr - Get Details Now!News13JobsReport.com Penny Stock Jumping 2000% Sign up to the #1 voted penny stock newsletter forfree today!www.AwesomePennyStocks.com $54/Hr Job: Work at Home Entertainment Best western Embrace the madness Just kidding...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Home TVMovies Music Fashion Theater Food Travel Pets Events Comics &amp; Games Columnists Blogs Horoscope Lifestyle NYC Local Business OpinionNews Vacay-Rod Alex Rodriguez and Cameron Diaz have their very own hot- stove...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gossip Celeb Photos PopWrapPage Six Family feud Uber-conservative Stephen Baldwin is bracing for a Baldwin...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teams High Schools Scores Sports Feeling 'Melo MEMPHIS — With each day, the Nets confidence seems to grow that...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHOTOS VIDEOS BLOGS 30 ° Today's Paper Login Register Classifieds Archives Subscribe More in Photos Click on Each Photo Video More in Videos VIEWED COMMENTEDMost Popular 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Family feud 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spidey's tangled web 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hubby would take back 'vow' 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cordial exes 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; End for Andy? York City ComicCon he couldn’t believe what Broadcast Standards andPractices was letting them get awaywith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He mimed smoking pot, as if maybe the censors were stoned and joked, “We’re going to make ‘Breaking Bad’ look like p-----s.” 4 Who will be the breakout star? Naturally, Lincoln is the center of the tale as Grimes, a small- town cop who tries to maintain decency in an out-of-control world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jon Bernthal plays his best friend and fellow cop, Shane (who is sleeping with Grimes’ wife) and Sarah Wayne Callies (the doctor on “Prison Break”) is Lori, the woman caught between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But fans of the comic booklove Glenn, so Stephen Yeun should have a blast playing the young pizza delivery guy (and sometime thief) who kind-of welcomed the zombie apocalypse because at least it solved his problem of massive credit-card debt. 5 Why does the show look different? Smart fans may be wondering how the show achieves its distinctive, washed-out but realistic look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Darabont revealed they shoot much, if not all, of the series on Super 16. 6 Who will play The Governor? Perhaps the juiciest role in upcoming seasons is The Governor, the self-styled ruler of a secure, four-block area and a half-mad lunatic who feeds the parts of humans who displease him to the undead and keeps his zombified daughter locked up in chains.Think Ian McShane in “Deadwood” . . . but crueler. 7 Can you stumble, drool, moan and show a fondness for human flesh? In contests for fans every week, AMC is offering walk-on parts as the undead, among other promotional efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They’re going to need a lot more zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Sign Up to see what your friends like. 4 More PrintNYPOST Comments (1) Vladimir Andreevich Makogonov 11/11/2010 10:26 AM DEAR INTERNET: THE WALKING DEAD IS SUCH INTERESTING SHOW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I HAD DOUBTS BEFOREHANDS - MR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANK DARAMONT SEEM MORE FAUX-PROFOUND POP PRINCE THAN REAL ARTIST TO ME BUT HE MAKE DEEP QUALITY STORY...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALSO ZOMBIES?
