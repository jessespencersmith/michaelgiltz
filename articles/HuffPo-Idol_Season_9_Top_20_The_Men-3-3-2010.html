He started off rough, then when the song got slower, he was worse, and it all felt a bit interminable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it wasn't as bad as last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Better, but not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Will being cute keep him safe for another few weeks? CASEY JAMES -- Sang Gavin DeGraw's lone Top 10 hit, "I Don't Want To Be," which has been performed a gazillion times on Idol .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James apparently doesn't have a TV but once he realized how often it's been done, he should have picked something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His guitar playing was fun but it's not good when the vocals seem like an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the chorus, which sort of meanders down, he really struggled and faded out at the end of lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the show loves him; he got a flashy low-camera intro and lots ofactive cutting to jazz it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 BIG NEWS: Celebrity Body | Playboy | Movies | Britney Spears | Energy Debates | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More Dead Birds, Fish Found Across The World WATCH: Demi Moore In A Teeny Bikini Dead Birds Fall From Sky AGAIN, 300 Miles From Earlier Mysterious Incident Lindsay Garvey iPhone Alarm Glitch: How It Cost Me My Job Intestinal Parasites May Be Causing Your Energy Slump Rudeness Is A Neurotoxin WATCH: Ashton &amp; Natalie Get Naked, Have Sex In New Movie Elizabeth Edwards' Will Revealed BECK IN TROUBLE?

I love that Lambert invented his own language and he almost certainly won the sympathy vote with his stories of nervousness and throwing up before sporting events, much less Idol . (Don't knock the sympathy vote; anything to stay alive!) Yes, he was very improved but since he had so far to come that's not saying much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lambert did sound pretty forceful at the moments where he dug in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he was still very nervous and shaking and what an awfullast note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still a long ways to go and the judges overreacted with their praise. (Lose the mullet.) TODRICK HALL -- Sang Tina Turner's career-defining, sole #1 hit "What's Love Got To Do With It." Last week he did Kelly Clarkson, so I thought, cool, he's gonna keep taking songs made famous by women until he gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he took a song that's already pretty slow (though in a deceptive way; Turner keeps it jaunty) and made it even slower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When he started to move it got a little better but thenhe had a horrible finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how can the judges say Tina Turner's song isn't relevant? It's a classic! Notgood but not disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JERMAINE SELLERS -- Sang Marvin Gaye's brilliant #2 hit "What's Going On." I thought Simon was going to nail him when he started to describe the song as a great...pop song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Almost, but not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the problem: Sellers sang one of the greatest protest songs of all time as if it were a love song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe he thought he was singing "Let's Get It On?" Seriously, did he even pay the slightest attention to the lyrics?"There's far too many of you dying....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; War is not the answer..." and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But watch him perform andyou'd swear he was romancing you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sellers was smiling and even winking at one point, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When a singer is that completely divorced from the lyrics, nothing good can happen artistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If he wanted to bring passionate gospel fervor, this could have been the perfect time to take it to church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, he tookit to the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANDREW GARCIA -- Sang James Morrison's debut single "You Give Me Something." (Morrison's sure getting performed a lot for a guy who's never had a Top 40 hit in the US.) He was weak, especially on the chorus and kept moving his arms robotically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was so-so, not awful but sometimes that's worse since memorably bad is at least memorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AARON KELLY -- Sang the first #1 hit of The Temptations, "My Girl." I knew Aaron was going to break out or flame out when he did the whole, head-shaking thing. (You know, that back and forth sort of Egyptian-ish thing.) Now here's where it gets confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of times I criticize singers for riffing all over the place and singing their asses off a la Mariah Carey when they've barely even sung the melody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But you can do anything you want if it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And for me, Kelly's runs and pretty convincing growl on"my girl" and his massive amount of vibrato all worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was really quite good, although like almost everyone he ended weakly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even if he'd been terrible, I would take issue with the judges, who all insisted the song was too old-fashioned, not contemporary, not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? It's a pop classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It'snot like he was doing some Tin Pan Alley number or John Park's disastrous take on Billie Holiday's "GodBless The Child." It's a timeless pop classic and people can sing it from now until doomsday as long as they do it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kelly did it pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan asking him if he liked Justin Bieber made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's no good answer to that one, Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saying no annoys the girls who like him and Bieber as well; saying yesmakes him look uncool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIM URBAN -- Sang Matt Nathanson's hit "Come On Get Higher," which sold a million copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leagues better than last week, though he set the bar so low that's not saying much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In fact, he wasn't bad and I agree with Simon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kind of hit a groove in the middle, though again he hit a very very rough last note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ellen's comment that he should act -- despite having no stage presence -- made no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's nicewhen a cute actor can also sing, sort of, but it's even better when they can really sing. (And the cast ofGlee can really sing.) And if you have no stage presence as a singer you'll probably have no stage presence as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LEE DEWYZE -- Sang Hinder's #3 hit "Lips Of An Angel." It's easy to see the producers are rooting for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He got wildly dramatic lighting, with the theater darkened during his first moments for the total rock star effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the audience started squealing during the first few lines (talent show Nashville Starloves it when that happens!) and I thought he looked very confident, hitching up his pants when he wanted to and smiling when girls screamed but digging into the lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the lyrics got mumbled when he was getting "passionate," but overall I thought he was quite effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too bad for him Karastepped over Simon's big line that Lee may be the one to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too many ready for home to pick two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'll just say that Lee Dewze and Casey James and Michael Lynche and Aaron Kelly are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who did you like this week?

Yep, the judges can often be contradict ory, which gets confusing for the artists who don't know themselves and what they want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I always say criticism boils down to this: it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rest is up to the singers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jermaine Sellers and John Park need to go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No argument here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What I always listen for is one word: elevation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did the singer elevate the music through their choices? And by elevate I mean did the singer make the music primary and not themselves .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think three did last night: Michael Lynch had the greatest performanc e of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly masterful artistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No need for words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just watch/list en to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, Ellen got it exactly right when she said that Alex Lambert was something unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The quality of his voice is something one can only be born with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the fact that despite his nerves, hedelivers almost a flawless vocal performanc e is a testament to the natural facility of his one of a kind voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the nervousnes s and inexperien ce is surely a plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have a one in a million voice and know how to use it, sit in a chair and sing for all I care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Believe it or not, Tim Urban was the only other one that stood out for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think the judges (minus Simon) need to listen to his performanc e back on video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was strong and on pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a great song for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was simple and it really worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He connected and elevated the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think Aaron Kelly had the potential to do something special last night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadly his voice sounded really tired and that just completely distracted me .. and him .. from connecting , elevating the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His battle with his voice became primary, not the music Alex does indeed have a cool voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks for commenting .Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:41 PM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it SteveS 10:11 AM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER RhiannonRings 12:46 PM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:41 PM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST SUPER USER Patrick Yaeger 09:43 AM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it HUFFPOST BLOGGER Michael Giltz 01:43 PM on 3/03/2010 Permalink | Share it FRONT PAGE POLITICS BUSINESS MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT COMEDY SPORTS STYLE WORLD GREEN FOOD TRAVEL TECH LIVING HEALTH DIVORCE ARTS BOOKS RELIGION IMPACT EDUCATION COLLEGE NY LA CHICAGO DENVER BLOGS Advertise | Log In | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Careers | FAQ | Contact Us User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type Copyright © 2011 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | "The Huffington Post" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All rights reserved.</p>
