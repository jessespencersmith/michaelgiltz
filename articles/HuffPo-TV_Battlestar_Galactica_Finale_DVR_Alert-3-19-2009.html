As so often happens, this is not reflected yet on my cable TV schedule and probably isn't on yours either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you don't want to miss the last 11 minutes of the series finale, you must go to your TV and either extend the episode an extra 15 minutes (or half hour) or just tape the next showairing on SyFy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a special twist because I'm taping the episode repeat at 11 p.m. (I also tape Friday Night Lights and Bill Moyers in Primetime and they conflict with the original broadcast.) Now with the original airing running through 11:11, does that mean the rerun will begin a few minutes later or11:30 or what? To be safe, I'm taping the channel from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reset your DVR now oryou'll have to watch it online or buy it on iTunes or just burn with frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what do you expect in the finale? I thought the miniseries was good, the first season great and the second season even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They stumbled a bit in the third season but are barreling towards afinale with great momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast is outstanding and I for one can't understand why TriciaHelfer hasn't been snapped up by a Scorsese or some other great director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She can do anything. (She does appear on Burn Notice in a recurring role.) What do you expect to happen? Will Starbuck (Katee Sackhof, another fun actress) and Apollo(Jamie Bamber, sigh) get it on for good?

(By the way, the theory of her being the firstcylon/human hybrid since she's Daniel's daughter is great, and her being an "angel" almost puts hercloser to that Galactica 1980 episode where we see the original Starbuck protect an "angel" andbecome the "father" of a hybrid.) More questions: Did they ever explain what happened to the "Boxey" character they introduced in the miniseries or was that Ron's way of messing with us? The cylons lived thousands of years, right? How did they make it to earth? Were they cylons before Caprica created them? Did the Caprica version just retreat during the war and find this thousands of years old "cylon" colony? The time line is pretty fuzzy for me here...can anyone help? MoreLiberalWithAge See Profile I'm a Fan of MoreLiberalWithAge permalink The 5 "original" Cylons are thousands of years old because they traveled from their "Earth" to the Colonies in a sub-light speed ship, and time slowed for them (Einstein's Theory ofRelativity).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus they were able to survive the journey back to the Colonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ancestors ofthe 5 were Cylons that were created on Cobol(sp?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those Cylons were originally entirelyrobotic but evolved into clone cyborgs who eventually became able to procreate, and in theprocess lost resurrection technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus, Ellen, Saul, Tory, Sam, and Galen were all bornfrom mothers and aged like humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the 5 of them worked together to recreateresurrection, which is how they survived their own nuclear holocaust (which resulted from aconflict between the humanoid Cylons and the robotic ones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They then traveled back to thecolonies to try to stop a similar conflict between humans and robotic Cylons, but found they were too late, as they arrived during the first Cylon war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They went to the Colony's cylons and created the 7 new humanoid cylons (and gave them resurrection technology), in the hopesthat if they had human form, they would be more sympathetic to the "real" humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But theywere wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hope this helps...this is what I understood from a bit of explication by Sam Anders shortly before he went into surgery. theblueAmerican See Profile I'm a Fan of theblueAmerican permalink It was a great finale to a frakin' great series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have unanswered questions about some things but then Madonna Video Celebrity Skin David Letterman Newspapers Health Rod Blagojevich Real Estate G-20 Summit MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â» Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

BSG was the work of Ronal Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's his vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; End of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The show was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I will miss it just like I do a great book when I finish reading it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parting is such sweet sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm glad they made it to earth, our earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I still don't get the opera house motif, I don't know, maybe thewhole show was just one big operetic story line being played out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edward Jame Olmos was great asAdama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks Ron Moore, thanks for the great mind blowing entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's see now, B5, Firefly (alas too short but we do have the movie) and BSG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's some great science fiction television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heros, Lost and even Smallville will just have to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now where are the Westerns (I know Deadwooddoes count)? Can't anyone write a good Western for television? GravitonX See Profile I'm a Fan of GravitonX permalink My biggest disappointment with an otherwise good show was it's amazing lack of Blacks in anything buttertiary roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it's science fiction, but for a show that set itself to be a thoughtful canvass ofconventional issues, it was sorely lacking in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, many white fans will see nothing wrong,perhaps, because they can often exist for extended periods of time without any meaningful interactionwith anyone outside their race, but for other minorities, the overwhelming abscence was salient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even in the season finale, when the show attempted to make a boldface connection of science fiction and science fact, the whitewashed narrative couldn't even bring itself to present Blacks in any significant role, even in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ChironexFleckeri See Profile I'm a Fan of ChironexFleckeri permalink Unfortunately, as a "white guy," I will have to agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I knew it was going to come up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a little leery of the "replacements" overall from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved the fact that they completelychanged the personalities...Gaius(my favorite and the one I most personally identify with),Starbuck, both Adamas, Boomer, Tigh, nearly the entire cast, but I was always a littleuncomfortable that african-americans were not cast in significant roles, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hollywoodsometimes takes a few steps foreword and backward at the same time, but I hope you liked the show as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure there will be great sci-fi in the future featuring african- americans cast in leading roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Art is always evolving. dkuz09 See Profile I'm a Fan of dkuz09 permalink I'll have to disagree on that front with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although it is true that blacks definitely only played minor roles in the series, that is not to say that the canvass was totally wiped clean of anyminorities at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I mean, how could you even state that when you have Edward James Olmosplaying the lead character, Admiral Adama (and he did so with so much intelligence andbrevity, I might add.) You also had the hindu actress (can't remember her name at the moment, so please forgive me) playing Tory, one of the final five cylons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Dualla, who committed suicide earlier in the second half of the season had a pertinent story line to play too, and I believe she is a black actress of South African descent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And there was also Gaeta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its very easy to condemn broadcast television for its lack of ethnicity, but cable television does seem to have its finger on the pulse of America, and BSG certainly did with its talentedcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Would I have liked to see more 'black' actors play a part in the series? Of course, whynot? But I'm not going to say that just because it didn't have 'black' minorities that it lacked inthat regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You had some of the best parts in the series given to minorties and for that Ithink is a step in the right direction in my book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GravitonX See Profile I'm a Fan of GravitonX permalink The idea that minorities are "interchangeable" therefore a representation of "some"minority should satisfy "all" minorities is fairly condescending, and I'm sure you didnot mean it as such, but in effect that's the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You claim that BSG had it's fingeron the pulse of America, yet in the same general breath you admit Blacks onlyplayed a minor role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do not wish to belabor the contradiction but the dissonance isapparent and the rationalization is fairly tortured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would seem nearly unimaginable that in America they could find no AfricanAmerican, yes, Black, to fill anything but a minor role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As I said, in the season finale, when they find Earth and land in Africa, they could find no Blacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They alsoembarked on tangential explanation of the origins of humanity (remember the"bones of a little girl - presumably Hera - found in Tanzania" headlined in the end ofthe seaon finale) essentially reinventing an Africa without Africans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:58 PM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 02:45 PM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:29 PM on 03/28/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 05:52 PM on 03/21/2009Michael Giltz: Battlestar Galactica Finale DVR Alert! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/embattlestar-galacticaem_b_176983.html [4/2/2009 9:17:28 PM] show gets good marks otherwise, but missed or deliberately sidestepped the opportunity to be one of the truly great progressive social commentaries using science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But, perhaps, in it's lack, it did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are More Comments on this Thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Click Here To See them All mgray34 See Profile I'm a Fan of mgray34 permalink Kudos to the producers of BSG!! The series finale did not disappoint!! All the loose ends and hanging questions were all answered and came together nicely! A much better series ender than SG1 orAtlantis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was nice how Starbuck's death and return, Baltar's visions of six and vis versa, and thevision at the cathedral that was experienced by Roslyn, Athena, Balter and Six throughout the seriescame together at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This show was one of the best sci-fi shows ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's darker sub plots added a sense of realism on how it would really be if a small remnant of the human race were fleeing and fighting for their lives against an enemy that had overwhelming force and motivation to destroy them. icastico See Profile I'm a Fan of icastico permalink I generally agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I thought the battle at the colony was a bit silly and the deus ex machina was a bit heavy relied upon to explain the mysteries, but over all I liked the way they wrapped things up. argyle See Profile I'm a Fan of argyle permalink I wonder which science fiction classic they will turn into a soap opera next? dkuz09 See Profile I'm a Fan of dkuz09 permalink If it means worldwide critical acclaim and a seat at the UN for the stories it creates that relate to real-wide issues in metaphorical way, then sign me up whatever it is! ramblingjohnny See Profile I'm a Fan of ramblingjohnny permalink They left some very juicy question unanswered off course I might have missed something...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We stillhave that direct to dvd movie "BSG:The plan" coming up and the Caprica pilot but what we sci-fi fan going to watch on tv in September? No new star trek, no more BSG, Terminator airing in the death slot should not last past season two. dkuz09 See Profile I'm a Fan of dkuz09 permalink What a great two hours and eleven minutes of television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To answer your questions, Kara Thrace is a (SPOILER), Gaius Baltar is not a (SPOILER) and President Roslin (SPOILER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you, Ron D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore for ending BSG on the highest note out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Truly amazed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chrisallalone See Profile I'm a Fan of Chrisallalone permalink I'm ticked about the extra 11 minutes, since I heard that it was to include previews of other shows, not because BG itself runs long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I don't need more ads for new programming on "SyFy" (ticked about thattoo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I have to hope I set the darn DVR right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I promised to wait and share it with my husband,who won't be home, and missing the final 11 minutes will send us both absolutely over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The notion that everyone's a Cylon is appealing, but I'm not sure I buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Didn't Baltar eventually make a working Cylon detector that could distinguish between Cylon and human? Implies there's somethingto distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ah, well, it's not long until we find everything out. sammywammy See Profile I'm a Fan of sammywammy permalink I agree - I think they'll - we'll - all be Cylons in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I hadn't thought about the idea of the Cylonsmaking the humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:52 PM on 03/22/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:49 PM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 01:26 PM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:22 AM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:44 AM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 06:33 AM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 12:36 AM on 03/21/2009 Reply Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 08:01 PM on 03/20/2009Michael Giltz: Battlestar Galactica Finale DVR Alert! http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/embattlestar-galacticaem_b_176983.html [4/2/2009 9:17:28 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright Â© 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type I hope they don't screw this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've got a lot to cover in the last episode and I fear some of my own burning questions might go unanswered (please explain how the Centurions evolved to "discover" theirgod, please explain the apparent real-life Earth connection provided by "All Along the Watchtower,"please don't spend another minute on who loves who or what and why...).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surreal2me See Profile I'm a Fan of Surreal2me permalink thanks for the heads up!
