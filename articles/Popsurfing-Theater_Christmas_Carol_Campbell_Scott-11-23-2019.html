                <p>More Create Blog Sign In SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2019 THEATER: Another "Christmas Carol," God Bless 'em A CHRISTMAS CAROL ** out of **** LYCEUM THEATRE Who wants to be a Scrooge when reviewing A Christmas Carol in any form? Not me, hence the generous two stars and a shout outs to some of the pluses in this holiday production imported (much like ourmodern conception of Christmas) from Merrie Olde England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's awarm, inviting stage on display, with lots of lamps casting a cheerful glow, the cast appropriately garbed (by and large) and some Christmas snow (that's not a spoiler; you know there's going to be snow) that'squick melting and fun rather than boring confetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Campbell Scott is a fine Scrooge that can hold his head high next to his dad's solid work in the same story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He harrumphs and galumphs andmelts just as quickly as that snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it's a real performance, not apanto bit of fun winking at the audience and not too hard-edgedeither.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Scott has a twinkle when dismissing his nephew early on that hints at an even fuller characterization he might tackle someday in a better version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But here's the main thought I had upon leaving A Christmas Carol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story is endlessly malleable of course and has been done in everysetting from TV sitcoms to lavish feature films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the vast majority of them remain pretty darn faithful to the details of the novella by Charles Dickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From versions starring Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Magoo to Alistair Sims toPatrick Stewart, they know the bones of a good story when they see itand leave well enough alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So the many, many diversions and additions by Jack Thorne this time out are all the more notable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A storythat's larded with well-earned sentiment doesn't need more. of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–¼ 2019 (90) â–¼ November (10) THEATER: Another "Christmastale positively full of lessons -- as full as a child's stocking by the fire on Christmas morning -- does not need those lessons repeated again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A show with warmth to spare does not need bonus hugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What it does need is a black box space or a theater in the round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This Carol was conceived in the round and Broadway desperately needs more spaces that can accommodate immersive productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They can't all be squeezed into Circle In The Square, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lincoln Center would be the other ideal space for this, but shows like Hadestowndeserve an ideal setting, not a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if you go, sit close andon the side to glimpse the in-the-round pleasure of being amidst thefun that director Matthew Warchus charmed up in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In general, the vibe is the winner here and you can overlook the sillychanges and enjoy yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carolers and musicians begin playing longbefore the show begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cast-members and others like Tim (one of the gift givers wandering the aisles in good cheer ,not the lad in the show) cheerfully hand out clementines and cookies before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bells arerung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entire space of the theater is used, an echo of the Londonstaging but a poor substitute when Scrooge's nephew must shout his lines from the upper level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And at the very, very end they play a lovely carol on the handbells that is sweet and simple and just right for theevening's end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scott is quite good and that counts for a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as much as I want to applaud the generally fine production design and costumes (both by Rob Howell), the lighting (Hugh Vanstone) and sound design (SimonBaker), they also make some odd choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stage is littered withpiles of old, discarded lamps, giant piles of junk that menacinglycapture the ugly spirit of the miserly Scrooge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assumed these would rise up and out of the way or be transformed into something nice or do...something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But those inert piles remained throughout most of theshow, serving no purpose and ultimately proving a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And didthe Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Future have to be garbed inbathrobes quite so garish and awful?
