"In the gromup world of film, there's a huge range of movies that are made, from little niche filrns to big blockbust- ers," Beckman says "But for some reason, for kids there is just that one basic kind of film that gets made over md ovef," Not at I{YICFE wNch witl be showins films at four venues this year: IFC Cen- - ter, Symphony Space, DcATheater and Can- tor FiIm Center "The short film progrm is great," says Beckman, who helped reach out to a celebrityjury that in- cludes actors Susan Sa- randon and Matthew Modine and director Gus Van Sant "We had 2,500 sub- missions this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll see a film from Norway, from Cmada, hom Spain, from Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You'll see animation and live- action and experimental bits You've got your ballots so you get to share your i thoughts, and at a lot of the screenings !weeks 'Noctuma' is a beautiful, gorgeous animated filrn that's a co-production from Spain md France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has elements of 'Al- ice in Wonderland,' ild it all takes place ai nighttime, when kids are sleeping " Whether it's mature subject matter dealt with in a simple, direct way or the simple fact of choosing a foreign-lan- guage film, Beckman says whenever he wonders if a film may be too sad or diffi- cult for kids to appreciate, those are in- variably the ones they like the most r "Vvhenwestarted, people said, 'Kids will never read subtitles,"' he says "That's utter [nonsense.] So we're trying to redefine what people thirk about when they think about f,lns forkids And the festival has grown very fast and htr become the biggest festival of its kind in the country and perhaps the world " Now the challenge is to expand the reach of NYICFE, and the organizers have got several ways of making that happen. "One of them is an online festival, which is going to be launched Feb. 29 atOpposite pagc:'Noctulna,'fJom Spain/France, has its U.S dgbut at this yea/s flm fest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aboye:'32A'b about a l3-year-old catholic schoolgid's llfe In 1979 Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The French animated fcatule "Max &amp; Co.' tells the tale of a fox and a cat who discover a corporation that brâ‚¬eds mutant Insects and then sells special f,y swatters. www.Skids.tv and that is going to be a place where kids and families and adults can watch cool short fllms," says Beck- man, who is mffiied md has watched his three kids grow up with his festival. (As with the actual fest, all filns online are rated md detailed, so parents cm choose appropriate tifles for all ages ) "We toured the festival last yem for the fust time and visited eight differ- ent cities," Beckman says.
