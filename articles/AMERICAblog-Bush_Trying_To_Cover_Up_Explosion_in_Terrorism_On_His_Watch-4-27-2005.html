                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , A P R I L 2 7 , 2 0 0 5Bush Trying To Cover Up Explosion InTerrorism On His Watchby Michael in New York on 4/27/2005 11:50:00 AMLast year, Bush's State Department lied to the American peopleby underreporting the number of terrorist incidents in anattempt to pretend Bush had done a better job fighting the badguys than the numbers indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had to resubmit a newreport with adjusted numbers and admit its "naughtiness."This year, Condi Rice just decided not to report any terroristincident numbers at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Too late, the Washington Post reports:The number of serious international terrorist incidents morethan tripled last year, according to U.S. government figures,a sharp upswing in deadly attacks that the StateDepartment has decided not to make public in its annualreport on terrorism due to Congress this week.In Iraq, terrorist incidents increased "dramatically" from 22 to 198,which puts the lie to Bush's claim that things have stabilized since thehandover to an interim government last summer."Last year was bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This year is worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They aredeliberately trying to withhold data because it showsthat as far as the war on terrorism internationally,we're losing," said Larry C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson, a former seniorState Department counterterrorism official, who firstrevealed the decision not to publish the data.After a week of complaints from Congress, top aidesfrom the State Department and the NCTC weredispatched to the Hill on Monday for a private briefing.There they acknowledged for the first time theincrease in terrorist incidents, calling it a "dramaticuptick," according to participants and a letter toSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice from Rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HenryA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Waxman (D-Calif.).And before you think we're getting all partisan:Both Republican and Democratic aides at the meetingcriticized what a GOP attendee called the "absurd"explanation offered by the State Department's actingcounterterrorism chief, Karen Aguilar, that the statistics arenot relevant to the required report on trends in globalterrorism. "It's absurd to issue a report without statistics,"said the aide, who is not authorized to speak publicly on thematter. "This is a self-inflicted wound by the StateDepartment."
