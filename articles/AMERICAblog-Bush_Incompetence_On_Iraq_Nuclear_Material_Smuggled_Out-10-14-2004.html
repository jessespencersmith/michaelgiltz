                <p>T H U R S D A Y , O C T O B E R 1 4 , 2 0 0 4Bush Incompetence On Iraq -- NuclearMaterial Smuggled Outby Michael in New York on 10/14/2004 04:07:00 PMOkay, I held off on commenting about the disappearance ofequipment and materials that could be used for making nuclearmaterials -- stuff that went missing AFTER we invaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bushieswere so vague at first I thought maybe, maybe they'd arranged toquietly spirit the stuff out of the country with Allawi's permission, butneither of them wanted to call attention to the fact since this mightmake him seem weak.So much for giving them the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We invaded Iraqbecause Bush said Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.Saddam didn't, but he DID have equipment and material that isessential for making those weapons -- material the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency had a close eye on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now CNN reports it hasn'tjust gone missing, but went missing over months if not a year andinvolved the use of heavy machinery to get it out of there! How's thatfor incompetence?Some choice nuggets:"The mysterious removal of Iraq's mothballed nuclear facilitiescontinued long after the U.S.-led invasion and was carried out bypeople with access to heavy machinery and demolition equipment,diplomats said on Thursday."The United Nations nuclear watchdog told the Security Council thisweek that equipment and materials that could be used to makeatomic weapons had been vanishing from Iraq without eitherBaghdad or Washington noticing."Great Britain's defense? It happened during the chaos after theinvasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excuse me? Shouldn't securing equipment and material formaking nuclear weapons be a TOP priority in an invasion? Isn't thisone more example of the danger of ignoring your military chiefs anddoing things on the cheap without enough troops? Stuff happens,says Rummy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yep, especially when you're incompetent."Several diplomats close to the IAEA said the disappearance of thenuclear items was not the result of haphazard looting," reports CNN."They said the removal of the dual-use equipment -- which before thewar was tagged and closely monitored by the IAEA to ensure it wasnot being used in a weapons program -- was planned and executedby people who knew what they were doing.""We're talking about dozens of sites being dismantled," a diplomatsaid on condition of anonymity. "Large numbers of buildings takendown, warehouses were emptied and removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would requireheavy machinery, demolition equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is not something thatyou'd do overnight.""This is a MAJOR security issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yellow cake from Iraq has now turnedup in Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First Bush didn't guard the weapons depots andthose stashes of armaments are being used against our troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nowhe failed to secure the very material and equipment that can be usedto build the WMDs we were all so worried about in the first place.Kerry should pound on this for the next three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We are less safetoday because of Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Daily KosObama and Holder, Release the Torture Memos -We've two competing stories for why AG EricHolder has requested another delay in the court-imposed deadline for releasing three key Bush OLCtorture mem...42 seconds agoFiredoglakeConyers Explains Failure to Impeach - The HouseCommittee on the Judiciary Majority Staff haswritten a Final Report to Chairman John Conyers,Jr. last month (March 2009), REINING IN THEIMPERI...37 minutes agoHuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...42 minutes agoEschatonBig Shitpile - Still growing...54 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show AllA M E R I C A B L O G T V Teach English in ChinaHave 1 years experience?
