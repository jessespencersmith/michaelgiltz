                <p>~VIS Presley left the building almost 30 years ago, but his music and concert per­ formances remain -and two new DVD sets focus­ &lt;ing on his historic TV ap­ pearances may prove he's more popular than ever. , ) "~lvis '68 Comeback Special- Deluxe Edi­ tion" is a threecdisc set ($49.98; BMG) featuring the entire ferocious, 'leather-jacketed NBC special that spectacularly put Elvis back on top after years of fending off the British invasion, serv­ ing in the Army and churning out awful albums (and even worse movies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It includes seven hours of material, including the original special, and com- o plete uncut footage from the entire four concerts that Elvis performed to 'cdrm the core of what - many consider the most important TV event of his career. , l"Elvis -Aloha From Hawaii Deluxe Edition" ($29;98; BMG) is a two" pis~ set documenting Presley's groundbreaking­ i(~grandiose concert that was broadcast by satellite all around the world and $den:l?Ymore than 1.5 bil­ H6il people. f [ -The DVD set includes the entire concert, the en­ tire rehearsal concert from the night before and un­ edltediootage of Elvis moving through the crowd ~~~~hting blessings and fmill people lIke a new messiah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BMG's Ernst Jorgensen served as a consultant on the projects -no sur- "On the '68 special, you can see Elvis is trying everything he can to please us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Therets an urgency and almost despair in it." prise, since he's one of the key people responsible for the elaborate boxed sets that have reclaimed Elvis's musical importance and the author of fanatically detailed accounts of Pres­ ley's recording sessions and day-by-day doings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jorgensen has been wait­ ing years for this treasure trove, but he's used to waiting -he had to wait until 1969 to see the spe­ cial in the first place. "In the small country of Denmark, it arrived 12 months after you'd seen it," says Jorgensen. "So I'd had the album for a year before I actually saw the show. and I freaked out completely." Despite all the advance hoopla, the " '68 Comeback Special" more than lived up to the hype. "It was nothing like I could have ever imagined because we'd never seen him in concert," Jorgensen says. "We only knew him from the movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the NBC special, you -can see Elvis is trying ev­ erything he can to please us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's an urgency and almost despair in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when you see 'Aloha From Hawaii,' here's somebody sitting on top of the world in total con- trol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's two very different emo­ tional experi-- ences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elvis needed us in '68." These two DVD sets are Holy Grails for Presley fans, but don't think that means Elvis re­ leases are coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the works by the Presley estate is an elabo­ rate multi­ part docu­ mentary - a la "The Be::l,tles An-, thology" -that plans to cover his entire career and to include never-before­ seen footage that Jorgen­ sen has been compiling from collectors and fanat­ ics all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But don't hold your breath: it won't be out any sooner than 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two new DVDs feature Elvis Presley's TV specials from his later years-both part of his comeback.</p>
