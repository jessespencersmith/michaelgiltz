                <p>May 19, 2007How To Tell You've Settled In At CannesCANNES -- May 19, late morningWhen the endless accordion music wafting up from the restaurantoutside your window changes from amusing to annoying to finallydisappearing into the background like white noise -- you've settled inat Cannes.When you start to cut lines just as aggressively as the Frenchjournalists -- you've settled in at Cannes.When you see on a monitor that Jake Gyllenhaal is walking up thered carpet about 50 feet away from you (looking quite dashing) andyou don't even walk over to glance at him -- you've settled in atCannes.And when you almost knock your brand new Apple laptop onto thefloor and grab at it desperately while blurting out, "ooh-la-la!"without even a hint of irony -- why, then you've settled in at Cannes.-- Michael GiltzPosted at 09:15 AM in Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film, FilmFestivals | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)Michael Moore: "Sicko"Visit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement CategoriesBingham Cup 2008BooksCannes 2008Cannes Film FestivalCelebsCoachellaComic-Con 2007Current AffairsFashionFilmFilm FestivalsFood and DrinkAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 1 of 107/22/09 4:43 PMPhoto: GettyCANNES -- May 19 morningThe mostly hotly anticipated film of the festival finally debuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sickowas a must-see for virtually everyone, not because they expected acinematic breakthrough but simply because Moore's movies are fun,entertaining and invariably spark heated debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there's one filmeveryone will ask you about when you return from Cannes, it'sMichael Moore's Sicko.And so the mad rush for the Lumiere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Normally, just arriving 15minutes early would give you plenty of breathing room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not this time.The Lumiere was "complet" -- completely full well before the filmbegan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The people who got in had the double pleasure of being thefirst to see the film and passing by the hundreds of journalists,market goers and others begging and pleading for entrance on theoutside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't sleep in, people!The film was typically entertaining, with some very moving footage ofreal Americans who got screwed by insurance companies, hospitalsand the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A mother losing her baby girl because the ER refused toadmit them in an emergency, a woman who worked at a Catholichospital for years only to have the board refuse life-saving treatmentfor her now deceased husband, and a woman with cancer who Mooreinforms us is now dead -- all due to the refusal to provide treatmentthey clearly needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its muckraking in the best tradition of activistjournalism.A funny contrast is made between the US health care system and thehealth care in Canada, the UK, France and even Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the veryfirst question at the wildly overcrowded press conference (it attractedeasily three times as many people as any other one so far) came froma Canadian who complained that Moore made their system seem togood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He immediately detailed some problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore's reply wassuccinct and perfect: would you trade your health care card inCanada for a US one? No, the man said immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, of coursenot, said Moore.Hopefully, he'll include a 30 second bit of voice-over before the USrelease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He should make clear that the health care systems in othercountries have flaws and that Canada shouldn't feel too proud: it'snot that hard to do better than the US. (In a ranking by the WorldHealth Organization, the US was 37th with Canada only a littlehigher.) Even in France, ranked by WHO as the best health caresystem in the world, people have genuine complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore agreesthat the health care in those countries isn't paradise and could beimproved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're just a lot better than the US.His simple point is that the richest country has one of the pooresthealth care systems in the industrialized world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And that's wrong. --Michael GiltzPosted at 08:47 AM in Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film, FilmIowa Caucus 2008LesbianMusicOutfest 2008PartiesPoliticsProvincetown Film Festival 2008Queen Mary 2 Historic CrossingReligionScienceSexSportsSydney Mardi Gras 2008Taylor Hanson for The AdvocateTelevisionThe DinahThe HRC Logo ForumThe L WordTheaterTravelRecent PostsMTV Video Music Awards...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cheap, Or What?Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles: 30 Years YoungEric McCormack Auctions Off Porsche for ProjectAngel FoodWhat is the Advocate Insider?

If theboat goes for a sail, you'll be trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if you're completelybored, have everything you need (photos, quotes, etc.) anddesperately need to be somewhere else, unless you're swimming youcan't go anywhere until the party givers decide the show is over andthat can mean HOURS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So be careful and make sure you find outexactly what they've planned. -- Michael GiltzPosted at 08:15 AM in Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film, FilmFestivals, Music | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)The Coen Brothers Triumphant New FilmCANNES -- May 18, eveningI spent the afternoon doing interviews and writing stories, includingthe Advocate.com exclusive about the director of Water Lilies comingout in print for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hence my lack of posting for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At10 p.m., the usually uncrowded late night screening was jammed fullbecause everyone who couldn't get into No Country For Old Men wasdying for their next-to-last chance to see the new Coen Brothers film.I'd just read the Cormac McCarthy novel it is based on and the bookis so funny and gripping (and bleak) I couldn't wait to see the movie.On first glance, I was a tad disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For me, the movie was goodand certainly a return to form compared to The Ladykillers andIntolerable Cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I am very alone in this opinion of "good, notgreat." Virtually everyone I spoke to was raving about the film andAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 5 of 107/22/09 4:43 PMVariety raved, saying it is "a bloody classic" and "one of their verybest." When it comes out in the US, I look forward to seeing it againand watching the movie they made rather than looking for the movieI expected.I was also alone when it comes to the Russian film The Banishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iwas mesmerized; everyone else was sleeping and the reviews havebeen brutal across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mind you, the reviews of Variety andthe Hollywood Reporter frankly matter much more than theaudiences who applaud or boo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rave from Variety means an obscurefilm few people liked is suddenly a "festival favorite." But in the caseof the Coen brothers, the audience and the critics and the majorreviewers are all in sync. -- Michael GiltzPosted at 08:08 AM in Books, Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film,Film Festivals | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)Tom Kalin Follows Up "Swoon"...15 Years LaterCANNES -- May 18 afternoonDirector Tom Kalin debuted his new film Savage Grace -- starringJulianne Moore -- in the Directors Fortight at Cannes today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greetedwith warm applause, the film opens in the US this November.Tomorrow, I'll take part in round table discussions with Kalin andstar Moore and tell you what I hear about this juicy period piece withsex, drugs, incest, murder and some lovely Givenchy outfits. --Michael GiltzPosted at 07:52 AM in Books, Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film,Film Festivals | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)May 18, 2007A Breath Of Sunshine Photo: GettyCANNES -- May 18, late morningAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 6 of 107/22/09 4:43 PMI've got an interview with the first-time director of Water Lilies (avery accomplished debut) at 11:45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I have to rush over to checkon my party and interview requests at the Majestic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's one of themassive (and massively expensive) hotels on the Croisette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Locals andtourists line up outside the entrance, their cameras at the ready tosnap any movie stars that might be staying there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It does bruise theego a bit to see people peering at you as you approach the guard withyour badge, raise their camera and then lower it again dismissivelyonce they get a good look at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inside, I find I'm still on hold forThe Golden Compass and St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trinian's parties but have a slot at theRupert Everett/Colin Firth round table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So I rush back to myapartment for a quick bite because having seen Les ChansonsD'Amour, I definitely want to check out the press conference thatstarts at 11.Disaster strikes when a filling pops out while I'm brushing my teethand I wonder with fear what a French dentist could possibly be likewhen even the French people who are supposed to be nice to you arenaturally unconcerned with your welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Images from MarathonMan pop into my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No bleeding and no soreness so whatever thehell is going on, I ignore it.At the press conference, everyone is already inside and questions arebeing asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stars can be seen on a monitor, as can the roomwhich is far from full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not a single journalist is waiting to go in, butwhen I flash my pathetic yellow badge, one of the seventeen or soguards tells me to wait behind the velvet rope. (This is why I never goto clubs with a doorman.) I stand there politely for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hestands there talking to the other guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one checks to see if orwhen I can be let in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, I gesture to him and say "S'il vous plait?"He looks at me, quite annoyed, and gestures at me with his palmsout, i.e. hold your horses you silly little journalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After anotherminute of chatting to keep me in my place, he heads over to a guardby the door, asks a a question and then reluctantly lets me in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ishower him with "Mercis" and then scuttle inside.The table of talent is on a platform just to my left, with an auditoriumof about 100 seats in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So as not to raise attention, I juststand by the first row against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My reward? I am in the directsight line of Gregorie LePrince-Ringuet, who plays the gay collegestudent Erwann and is rightly described by the director as "a breathof sunshine." We know the character is truly gay because the firstbook you spot in his bedroom is Edmund White's The BeautifulRoom Is Empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have to listen to the questions and answers viaheadphones that provide instant translation into English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I gatherGregorie is not gay himself, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talking about thethreesome, the director Honore says, "All these characters have nosexual concerns about a threesome or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they are peoplefor whom feelings are more important than sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We were very carefulabout the rather naughty side and we wanted to make sure we coulddesexualize those scenes." Questions about sexuality and languageAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 7 of 107/22/09 4:43 PMraise a knowing laugh when one of the actresses (Clotilde Hesme,who plays Alice) points out, "When you're talking about language andsexuality and tongues you've got to be careful." Apparently, in Frenchthe word for tongue is the same as the word for language, whichprobably explains how they invented French kissing.And Gregorie has this to say about what he liked about his role: "He'sa character who is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He doesn't have all the problems ofthe others because he is still a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He can fall in love withoutdoubting his sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's a virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a bit anxiousplaying a homosexual [this after friendly comments that he and thelead got along vey well in the sex scenes].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it went off very well.When he was caressing me all over, the director told me it shouldn'tbe like two heterosexuals playing homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We played a couple,which has no gender."Au revoir, Gregorie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd love to come up with a question -- anyquestion -- to ask you, but I have to make my next interview. --Michael GiltzPosted at 07:46 AM in Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film, FilmFestivals | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)Love Songs Photo: GettyCANNES -- May 18 early morningWe're rushing out the door for the first screening of the day (at 8:30am) and the first screening in the grand Lumiere theater, holy groundat Cannes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movie is Les Chansons D'Amour by ChristopheHonore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to see every film that's in Competition (22 in all) butthis one had a movie still that led me to believe there might be somequeer content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Voila! It's a musical that makes use of pop songswritten by Alex Beaupain, who's worked with the director before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TheAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 8 of 107/22/09 4:43 PMcharacters simply break into song, without any dramatic switch instyle or tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not ironic and anything but kitschy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They singbecause they have to.The story follows Ismael (Louis Garrel) who has somehow foundhimself in a threesome with his girlfriend Julie (Ludivine Sagnier)and Alice, who is really devoted to "non-sex" but happily kisses Julie.Neither seems gay, but since it's a post-gay world where labels arepasse,who cares? Tragedy strikes and Ismael is alone, distraught andsomehow becomes the object of affection for Erwann (the charmingGregoire Leprince-Ringuet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I assumed that this gay dalliance wouldbe a momentary diversion to drown Ismael's sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Erwann isawfully persistent and innocently believes that he can fall in love witha straight man ten years older than him and it could somehow work.The movie wants to believe this too and ends with a line perfect foranyone who finds themselves another's obsession: "Love me less, butlove me for a long time."A small stream of walkouts (typical for almost any film), but a strongapparently French contingent applauded loudy and I heard no boos.(Boos are very, very common here; more on that later.) Not a whollysuccessful film, but interesting and refreshing in its attitudes. --Michael GiltzPosted at 07:08 AM in Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film, FilmFestivals, Music, Sex | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)May 17, 2007Sneak Peek At FridayCANNES -- May 17 late nightWhat's up tomorrow? (Or more accurately, what's up in 5 hours?First, at 8:30 am is a French film called Les Chansons D'amour.Obviously, I want to see any film with queer content, but I also wantto avoid reading plot summaries so I can enjoy the films with as littleadvance knowledge of what they're about as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just the posterfor Water Lilies (the fine debut feature I saw today) led me to believethere would be some Sapphic content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm less certain aboutChansons, but one still of two guys sort of singing to each other (it's amusical of sorts, I think) indicated there might be a gay subplot.Maybe.After that I head off to interview the young director of Water Lilies.Then I need to check back in with the publicists to see how myrequests for access to the AmFAR auction, the junket and party forThe Golden Compass and other events are progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 2:15 I'vegot a press screening (an off-site preview as opposed to its officialCannes debut) for Savage Grace, the Tom Kalin film starring JulianneMoore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And my big goal for the evening is to camp out with my lowlyyellow badge and make certain I gain entry to one of two screeningsof Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country For Old Men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just finished theCormac McCarthy book, which was very good but even bleaker thanAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 9 of 107/22/09 4:43 PMThe Road.Depending on how that goes, I'll either be checking out one othermovie or heading to a soiree for Jessica Simpson to trawl for partyquotes. -- Michael GiltzPosted at 09:07 PM in Books, Cannes Film Festival, Celebs, Film,Film Festivals | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)Where's The Party?My new gay roomie clearly knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The straight guys haven't evengone out for a late night beer: one is snoring and the other is in hisboxers talking to his girlfriend on iChat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But my new gay roomie isalready exploring gay clubs in town, away from the festival andliterally on the other side of the train tracks. (I'd say 99% of festgoershave never been beyond those tracks.) He hit some club in townbased at a home where 13 euros gets you a vodka and coke and entryto a backyard where a bunch of French boys drink and dance tilldawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was bored and I was too, not to mention annoyed when Icouldn't quite catch the name of the club or where it was locatedwithout asking again, which would seem lame since I just agreed itsounded awful. -- Michael GiltzPosted at 08:57 PM in Cannes Film Festival, Film, Film Festivals,Parties | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)Privacy Policy | User Agreement | Community Guidelines | LegalNoticeAdvocate.com ¬© 2008 Regent Entertainment Media Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All RightsReserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/cannes_Ô¨Ålm_festival/page/5/ 10 of 107/22/09 4:43 PM</p>
