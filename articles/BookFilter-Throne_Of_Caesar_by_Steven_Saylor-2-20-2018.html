Certainly Gordianus himself hopes to retire from ferreting out crime and deceit in the age of Caesar, Marc Antony and Cicero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's an old man after all and long- time fans of the tales will enjoy what feels like a career capper of a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saylor spends half his time reminiscing about old jobs and how far Gordianus and his family have risen in society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other half of the time is spent reminiscing with oldfriends and touching base with clients past, present (and perhaps future).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When those clients include the orator Cicero (theman who prodded Gordianus into his first case) and the wife of Caesar and Cinna (the greatest poet of his age) at least those moments are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For all the nostalgic sense of winding things up with a graceful goodbye, this is a fine entry point for newcomers not ready to start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why? Because the murder at the heart of this story -- theassassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides Of March -- is so familiar to modern readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That should make this a pretty dullmystery since most schoolchildren know Brutus of "Et tu" fame will be involved, along with a host of politicians. (Thosebackstabbers.) But Saylor pulls a nifty fast one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While we've been waiting for the assassination of Caesar, Saylor has been setting up another murder right in front of our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also takes on Shakespeare by offering his own Antony eulogy, not to mention describing not one but TWO epic poems that are masterpieces we would read today...if they hadn't been lost intime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, for all the cleverness, this feels like a gentle goodbye, with the aching and elderly Gordianus happy to retire tohis garden for a good nap and perhaps a spot of writing.... -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "A rip-roaring detective adventure for fans of Steven Saylor's Roman intrepid hero Gordianus, who finds himself embedded in the inner circle of Julius Caesar himself, as destiny ticks." -- Adrienne Mayor, author of The Poison King and Amazons "Steven Saylor's remarkable writing in The Throne of Caesar is so rich in realistic detail that ancient Rome literally unfolds before your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If anyone wants to understand Rome at the end of the Republic, there's nobetter fictional narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Mary Renault's magic with words, historical fiction tinged by legend or myth intertwined with known facts and archaeological verity just could not be more elegantly written than here with Saylor's astonishing grasp of Roman life." -- Patrick Hunt, Ph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; D., Stanford University, author of Hannibal "Engrossing" -- The Wall Street Journal on The Triumph of Caesar "Superb" -- The Globe and Mail (Toronto) on The Judgment of Caesar "Compelling" -- USA Today on Wrath of the Furies "Exquisite" -- The Philadelphia Enquirer on A Mist of Prophecies "Saylor can be a compelling (and sometimes very funny) storyteller, with a striking talent for historical reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half a century before imperial rule, Gordianus' Rome is a crumbling democracy; ideology is adirty word; politicians struggle for naked power, not principles; hands are everywhere in the till; political debate is reduced to flashy spectacles and sound bites; only the forms of the democratic constitution still totter on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For all its complex oddities, Saylor is asking us to feel very much at home in Gordianus' Rome." --n Mary Beard, author of SPQR , in the Times Literary Supplement - What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ¬©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
