Nope, the52 warnings about Al Qaeda represented HALF of allintelligence reports from April to Sept. 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words,EVERY OTHER REPORT was a warning that Al Qaeda was aboutto attack.Think this isn't a bombshell right up there with Condi's admittalof Bush knowing "Bin Laden Determined To Attack US"? Thenwhy this:"The Bush administration has blocked the public release of thefull, classified version of the report for more than five months,officials said, much to the frustration of former commissionmembers who say it provides a critical understanding of thefailures of the civil aviation system," according to the NYT.Link this with reasonable steps like making sure that thenames of people flying into this country are checked againstknown terrorist lists and it becomes clear: 9/11 could havebeen prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the way, it's more than four years after9-11 and they STILL don't have a combined watch list that iscross-checked against passengers on airlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top Al Qaedaleaders known to us could STILL fly into the US under theirown names and not be caught.The next 9/11 could be prevented, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But will it?
