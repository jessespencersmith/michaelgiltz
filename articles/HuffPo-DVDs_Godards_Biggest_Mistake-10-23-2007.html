But the TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles seemed like an awful idea to everyone in 1993 and that didn't turn out so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, Lucas ensured the show would be a bit plodding thanks to his desire to make it "educational." And the early episodes with a 10 year old Indy being dragged around the world by his parents and tutor were rather dutiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But great casting can solve a lot of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Sean Patrick Flanery popped in as the teenage Indy, the show took off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flanery had the plucky spirit and gee-whiz enthusiasm just perfect for a young Indy; the adventures became more organic and high-spirited once his parents were mostly out of the picture; and the lectures about history and art and so on faded into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indy still bumped into every famous person on the planet - from Thomas Edison to Tolstoy - but it didn't seem so tiresome with Flanery around to get into real scrapes. (It's a shame he didn't get tomake the leap to the movies as young Indy, since Lucas planned to make a trilogy around RiverPhoenix and Flanery would have been a perfect fit.) But The Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones Volume One ($129.99; Paramount) isn't the TV show, as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It contains 7 "movies" cobbled together from 2 episodes each and eliminates the framing device of old Indy reminiscing about his younger days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People shouldn't complain too much, sincethe show was extremely expensive and hardly a big hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it would have been nice to get the oldIndy scenes included on the extras or at least the pilot in its oringal form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead we get dozens and dozens of mini-documentaries on the historical figures and eras Indy was involved in, ranging from Norman Rockwell to the suffragette movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typically, they'reabout 20 to 30 minutes long and quite good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what to say? Those who prefer to see a favorite TVshow the way it actually aired will be stuck in limbo for years if not forever, just like the fans ofStar Wars who lamented Lucas's ban on the original theatrical edition for so many years. (There will never be enough demand to prompt the release of the show in its original form.) Those whomight expect loads of extras about the making of this ambitious, globe-trotting show get nothing.Those who prefer the far more popular teen Indy Flanery must pay to get just two Flanery moviestacked onto the five movies of young Indy, rather than sets devoted to each actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But any families looking for wholesome entertainment that is - gulp - good for you might trick their kids into watching these tales and the fine history lessons that come with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone with sense will tell you that the current theatrical hit The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford has to be seen on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the riveting performance of Casey Affleck as Ford, it's one of the most beautifully shot films of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But thanks to flat panelTVs and home theater sound systems, watching even the most visually stunning films at home isn'tcheating yourself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So go ahead and buy Days of Heaven ($39.95; Criterion), the TerenceMalick film that clearly inspired Jesse James and remains one of the most beautiful films of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your home theater system deserves it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was the finale of The Sopranos a mistake? Watch the final episodes all over again on The Sopranos Season Six, Part 2 ($99.99; HBO) and you'll be better prepared to judge whether that abrupt cut to black was brilliant or a brilliant cop-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No one can argue that James Gandolfini made no mistake when he oversaw the wrenching documentary Alive Day Memories: Home FromIraq ($24.98; HBO), the film that does our wounded veterans the respect of seeing them and acknowledging them face to face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: Disney's animated flick Meet The Robinsons ($29.99; Disney); The L Word Complete Fourth Season ($55.98; Showtime), because lesbians and the people who love them deserve a guilty pleasure just as much as everyone else; the fascinating I Was Nineteen ($24.95; First Run), which depicts a Soviet soldier of German descent returning home as a victor; Heart embraces the trend of artists performing classic albums in their entirety with Dreamboat AnnieLive ($19.98; Shout), an April concert that finds Ann and Nancy Wilson in great voice and doing some terrific encores, though a commentary track or full documentary about the actual making of "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huff TV Arianna Appears on ABC's "This Week" Roundtable With George Stephanopoulos (VIDEO) Arianna was a guest this morning on...

I did when young relatives came for a visit....ohmigawd..sheer drivel) OR he might do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I loved the Young Indiana Jones show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Was bummed when it was cancelled and to be honest I wasn't too thrilled in how elderly Indiana was portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I felt he should have had a much more dignified life than what was shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I can't speak to the films by Goddard having only seen them years ago and feeling like I just was not as intelligent a filmwatcher as I thought I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I just saw Battleship Potemkin and in taking it in the context of when it was filmed it was indeed a great movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I see it more as a historical film now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT about the history it portrayed but rather the historythat is the film itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I HATED THE ENDING OF THE SOPRANOS! I didn't want to see him gunned down in front of his family but I wanted to see him taken down along with his entire mob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Violent moralless non humans.Fascinating to watch but not to want to emulate, admire or want as neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My fantasy ending was, since we never saw Drea's actual death, that she had survived the shooting and after years rehab in a private hospital she somehow ends up in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then she begins her search forrevenge by taking out Tony's gang one by one with noone having any idea of who it is doing the killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally Tony himself gets shot down by her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz See Profile I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz permalink Drea killing Tony? I think you've got a future writing fan fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's a fun twist I doubt they ever would have filmed but would be fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And of course you're absolutely right aboutnot pre-judging the Star Wars live action TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I think the standard lately is that theless involved Lucas is the more likely it will be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trailers for the three Star warsprequels were stunning. (Not his regular editors, I believe.) The Clone Wars animated series -- very hands off by Lucas -- was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if he sets the TV show in motion but lets others take charge, I'd be hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since believe he will in fact be deeply involved, I'm less hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But of course I'll be watching the first episode and hoping just like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apples See Profile I'm a Fan of Apples permalink There are some other interesting DVD releases for this week that weren't mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a huge fan of 'Veronica Mars' and even though the 3 seasons never garnered the kind of ratings that it deserved, the fact that everything is now available on DVD should give a chance for newbies todiscover just how much fun this well written series was, and what a delight Kristen Bell is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plus, if younever saw the original shows when they were broadcast in Hi-Def, the DVDs will finally give you a chance to judge how well the wide-screen series was shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Series 3 was perhaps the weakest and less all-round cohesive series, but it is still better than the average TV box set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it was released thisweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How about the greatest film ever made? This week '2001:A Space Odyssey' is released in all formats, regular, Blue Ray and HD with a ton of new extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm told that the film in Hi-Def is stunning and ifthere is any DVD out there that would get me running for either a Blue-Ray or HD player at Christmas itis this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, other Kubrick movies get the re-release and Hi Def treatment with new extras, but thejewel in the crown has to be 'Odyssey.' Finally, I think Michael has the Jean-Luc Godard assessment correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I enjoyed 'Breathless' but have trouble mustering up any enthusiasm to actually sit through most anything else by the famed director,with the exception of maybe 'Tout Va Bien.'
