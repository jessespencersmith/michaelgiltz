"John kept encouraging me with this record to just put my voice front and center, to just go for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stop hedging my bets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That was liberating; a little scary at some points but it was really fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inever thought that I was...I mean, I thought that I could be a good interpreter in some ways, but I knew a lot of singers that had better technique than me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was always kind of setting myself up for failure in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, I always put my stock in being a songwriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an honorableprofession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here we are 35 years later and to go, 'OK, I'm just a singeron this,' it took some courage on my part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, it wasn't that heavy a deal; it was just fun." It's hard to imagine Rosanne Cash shy or tentative about anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She's made a Grammy-winning career out of boldness, from her commercial smash hits like Seven Year Ache and King's Record Shop to the Blood On The Tracks -worthy examination of a relationship on Interiors .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cash has also branched out in numerous creative ways, from a book of short stories -- Bodies Of Water -- topieces for the New York Times on songwriting to a very funny essay in The Nation about how she'dmake a better Republican candidate for VP than Sarah Palin. (Cash is also at work on her memoirs, which she plans to finish next year.) But there was always the weight of that bloodline: the granite monument to Americana that was her dad, the direct link to folk via her mom and the Carter family, not to mention the constantpressure of the public eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cash wasn't always happy about sharing her family with the world, but she was always honest about it and people respected that, were even drawn to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Cash wasn't just ready to record these songs artistically, she was also ready to share one more private piece ofher life. "Even beyond that," agrees Cash, "to not be afraid of the legacy any more and to accept what my parents left me, because my mother loved this music just as much too, so her love is also there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iprobably carried a chip on my shoulder a little longer than necessary: I don't want to draw comparisons to my dad; I don't want to trade on his name; I want to do this on my own; I want to separate myself. "Well, 35 years is a long time to do that," she laughs. "It's kind of not gracious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it's my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I accept this and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love these songs like DNA." Her love of these tunes is obvious on the album, as well as the maturity of an artist and woman who has lived a complicated, full life and learned a few things on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her version of "TakeThese Chains From My Heart," for example, instead of being pleading or heartbroken, is almost understanding in a way. "Well, that would be the sensibility of a woman my age, rather than a 25 year old," says Cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obviously, her approach now is very different than it would have been when she first learned themas an 18 year old, sitting on a tour bus and getting her dad to sing these songs to her one by one. "Very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How could it not be? I've now brought a whole life to these songs, which is the greatest part to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think if I'd tried to do these when I was 25 or even 30, I would have just tried to sing them without having lived any of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I've lived a big life and I could bring a lot of it to these songs."

"That was really emotional for me," says Cash. "I thought about Helen Carter, who taught me how to play the guitar and how important the Carter women were for me, how much I learned from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helen taught me I could really own these songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I couldn't just admire them from afar; I could step inside them." But that lament for lost love, in which a woman asks to be buried under a certain tree and hopes the man that left her might see the grave and think of her sometime, wasn't that a bit...submissive for Cash to identify with? "There is a way to sing it without being a victim," explains Cash. "Also, I was really aware I was doing a period piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's something you can't forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This song is from the Twenties." So Cash has opened up to her family history and to her own talents as a singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just don't ask to see the entire list: she's holding onto that for a little while longer. "Number one, I want to do Volume Two," says Cash, about her plans to do a follow-up album. "And number two, I want to eventually do the right thing with the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not just going to post it on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I think it has to be archived properly." --30-- Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews at Popsurfing and enjoy the weekly pop culture podcast he co-hosts at Showbiz Sandbox .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews.Note: go to my Popsurfing podcast to hear my entire interview with Rosanne Cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But be aware -- due to my technical incompetence, there are two gaps of about 20 seconds in the recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, none of them involve Cash's comments so you'll hear every word she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HuffPost Stories Surging On Digg READ MORE Afghanistan Barack Obama Health Care Photo Galleries Video Iraq Housing Crisis GuantÃ¡namo Bay Small Business MORE BIG NEWS PAGES Â»More Celebrity News at People.com HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES This Blogger's Books from digg it20 diggs Keith Olbermann To Deliver Hour- Long "Special Comment" On Health Care digg it167 diggs CNN Fact Checks SNL Sketch Detailing Obama's Failures (VIDEO) digg it88 diggs Fox News's Shepard Smith Goes After Sen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John Barrasso On Public Option digg it16 diggs Dana Ullman: Epidemic Of Fever Phobia: The Facts On Why Fever Is Your Friend Comments 0 Pending Comments 0 View Comments: Newest First Expand All Ads by Google Forget Cash For Clunkers More Trade-In Value On Your Car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Get 0.9% APR At MotorWerks!
