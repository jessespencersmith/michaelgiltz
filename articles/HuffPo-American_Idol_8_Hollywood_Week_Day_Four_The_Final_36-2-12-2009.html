If you're wondering why she got through last night and then was eliminated today,don't forget this was all taped months ago, including her getting in and Felicia Barton getting theboot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To avoid ruining the drama, they just kept the news that Pacitti had been booted until afterthe episode aired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the judges were still wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ratings were strong, up a tick from the night before and down a modest 7% from a year ago, according to MediaWeek's Marc Berman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means an audience of about 25 million people and bigger than the other four networks combined from 8-9 p.m. and a little less from 9-10 p.m.Berman also insists that putting forward Tatiana Del Toro and Nick Mitchell that Idol has nothingto do with talent and everything to do with oddball personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I have a good friend who alsoinsists the show is not about singing -- it's about stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I strongly disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First, there's a big difference between how the show is edited to entertain audiences (especially before the Top 12) and the selections made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, people like Tatiana and Nickseemed to get through because the producers wanted them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still ,we heard Simon objectingstrenuously about Nick and possibly about Tatiana as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nothing really matters until the Top 12.And once we hit the Top 12 it's clear that the judges ARE focused on talent, despite some oddringers that slip through like Sanjaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is why the top 12 has consistently produced successful Be the First to Submit This Story to Digg Get Breaking News Alerts Share Print Comments never spam Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

At least it was based on more singing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We had three Sing Offs during the two hour show and it certainly made for good TV, thanks to the fact that each guy could hear the other one perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least they had the good taste not to face offGokey and Rogers, which would have been silly since everyone knew Gokey was going through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CODY SHELDON VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALEX WAGNER-TRUGMANThe first Sing Off was the best, thanks to the fact that the two guys liked each other and Alex seemed genuinely upset about seeming to get through at the expense of his friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cody didn't really sing the lyrics so much as just perform words and phrases -- an ok voice but if you can't tell a story, it doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex to me was much better with "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" even though he started in too high a key (and immediately walked away and whispered the same opinion after I'd already written it down).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were very metrosexual while comforting each other, which was nice to see and Alex appealed as a person for his reaction to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's got to change that last name, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How about just Alex Wagner or Alex T? JENN KORBEE VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KRISTEN MCNAMARANeither one was very good in my book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jenn sang a Dixie Chicks tune and Kristen was a tad better singing "I Will Always Love You." Paula seemed to call Kristen insane, which is pretty damningcoming from kooky Paula but the women seemed to prefer Kristen and the men the prettier Jenn.When the women suggested why not just have all models singing, Simon seemed to think that wasa perfectly good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kristen remains clueless -- in the midst of a sing off when it's clearly one orthe other, she sat next to Jenn but remained completely oblivious to the girl and the awkwardnessof the situation and stayed focused on herself and how she hoped she would get through.Nonetheless, she got through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I feel worse and worse for Nancy every episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANKIE JORDAN VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JESSE LANGSETH Simon at his bluntest best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He comforts the loser Frankie by telling her, "You wouldn't have won anyway" and when that brings out moans from the other judges, he tops it by telling Jesse -- thegirl who just made the final 36 -- "You won't win either." Hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JACKIE MIDKIFF VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NATHANIEL MARSHALL Jackie sang "When A Man Loves A Woman" but we found out that Nathaniel's mom has been (or is) in prison and of course he cries at the drop of a hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Putting all that aside, Nathaniel was a tadbetter and gets through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Simon could have given the same speech to both of them that he gaveto the last group: Jackie wouldn't have won and Nathaniel won't win either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICHAEL SARVER VS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MATT BREITZKEThe two tough guys, a wildcatter on an oil rig and a welder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why was Sarver in this spot? He got stronger and stronger throughout Hollywood Week so what were they wondering about? It justseemed an easy way to flip the drama and put them both through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The music cues were also fun last night: Anoop got a funky soul track, Gokey and Rogers got Mazzy Star as Gokey said goodbye to his best friend and wittiest of all, Nick Mitchell (who got throughbecause he promised to keep goofing around as his alter ego) broke down to the tune of "Tears of AClown." So what did you think of the Sing Off? Cheap stunt or was it at least nice to see them refocus on singing? How about the Top 36?
