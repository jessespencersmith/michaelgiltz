Nirvana:Unplugged In New York ($19.98; Geffen) is just as historic as you remembered and presented perfectly with the entire concert (including two extra songs) plus the broadcast version and evenrehearsal footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Led Zeppelin: The Song Remains The Same ($20.97; Warner Bros.) sounds sonically overwhelming (as it should) and has fun extras like a press conference about the band'smoney getting nicked from their hotel in New York -- the Drake -- and a Cameron Crowe radio piece on the movie that sounds more like an ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Best of all, you can avoid the fantasy scenes and home life bits and skip to the concert segments, though really nothing captures the 70s quite like seeing Robert Plant playing "Lord of the Rings" in a Welsh forest by dressing up in ancient garb, carrying around a sword, picking wild mushrooms and staring up thoughtfully at the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colma: The Musical ($27.98; Lionsgate) has a nice DIY feel and it's good to see low-budget indies tackle musicals but it would be nice if the pleasant cast could sing better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mika: Live In Cartoon Motion ($14.98; Universal Republic) is a live concert from the UK dance-pop singer who could give Freddie Mercury lessons in flamboyance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007 ($29.99; Rhino) documents his latest guitar jam featuring virtually every name guitarist you can think of and climaxes with his Blind Faith buddy Steve Winwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, Film Noir: Five Classics From The Studio Vaults ($49.95; Kino) collects some corkers, especially an early Powell-Pressburger wartime suspenser called Contraband (1942) and a terrifically good, hard-boiled post-war British noir about gangsters with the can't-be-improved title They Made Me A Fugitive (1947). (Don't worry; they'll pay for it.) Also out this week: Nosferatu: The Ultimate DVD Edition ($29.95; Kino), beautifully restored with loads of extras; Live Free or Die Hard ($29.99; Fox), the Bruce Willis franchise taken to a satisfying if ludicrous conclusion; Hudson Hawk Special Edition ($19.94; Sony), a woebegone Willis flop at the time that has a genuine cult following among folk who think it's the Buckaroo Banzai of its day (and if you don't know that movie you best stay away); In Between Days ($29.95; Kino), a quiet gem about a South Korean girl living in a northern American city and giving first lovean uncertain whirl with a high school buddy and sometime thief; Hearts Of Darkness: AFilmmaker's Apocalypse ($24.99; Paramount), the acclaimed documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now; Star Trek Season One ($194.99; Paramount) which combines both the DVD and HD-DVD formats in one deluxe set though surely anyone with HD-DVD doesn't want regular DVDand anyone with regular DVD won't want to spend so much more to get a version they can't watchyet; Monsieur Hire ($29.95; Kino), a gem of an erotic mystery muted in tone but not in emotional impact; Mission: Impossible The Third Season ($49.99; Paramount), which is so fun it reminds you how far off the mark the movies have really been; The Universe: The Complete First Season($44.95; A&amp;E), the solid science series on the History Channel -- I can't wait to see how it turnsout; and the 2008 Video Playmate Calendar ($19.99; Image) and I can't wait to see how that turns out either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So tell me, what's your favorite Hitchcock film? Is there one you just don't get? Me, I love Rear Window and - scandalously - am not a huge fan of Vertigo (though it does have one of the all-time great scores).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What about you?

Cotten's time on the A-list was relativelybrief, but the body of work he compiled while he was hot is quite impressive. unemployedprogressive See Profile I'm a Fan of unemployedprogressive permalink For me it is a toss up betweem Rear Window &amp; North by Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I admire Psycho and The Birds fortheir unrelenting creepyness, but that just isn't as entertaining as the others. mtreder See Profile I'm a Fan of mtreder permalink Of the British period, my favorite is The 39 Steps, with The Lady Vanishes as a close second.Ultimately, though, nothing beats Vertigo as both stunning drama and masterful film-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Iagree that it's hard to narrow the list with Hitchcock; I mean, what about Psycho? Or Strangers on aTrain? Or Notorious? Or...? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LanceJetson See Profile I'm a Fan of LanceJetson permalink OK I give....when I was a child there was *The Birds*, and of course *Psycho* that scared me to death.But as I grew older and knew more about the composition of film and the director's role I wasintroduced to Hitchcock's earlier works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Films like *Rebecca* and later *Strangers on a Train*introduced me to the tricks of the trade that Hitchcock invented, the viewpoints, the atmospherics, theattention to clue-yielding objects, not to mention his themes of identity and memory: "Who are we,really?" In that vein I'd have to say *Spellbound* remains my favorite and could be used as a "textbook"example of masterly directorial technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SamanthaJaneSalem See Profile I'm a Fan of SamanthaJaneSalem permalink I want to say "Vertigo" is my favorite because it zooms in on an obsession with so much intensity--through color, shape, movement, music-- that it epitomizes Hitchcock's genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But heck I love Cary Grant running away from the plane in the cornfield. "North By Northwest" changes directions so many times, it seems to be a movie about one thing and then it shifts to another thing, and then again to something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.N.-- train-- Mt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rushmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I-- scandalously-- don't care as much for "Psycho" with it's pseudo-psychological writing at the end, after the characters take turns going back to the motel, as well as the absence of Hitch's usual glamor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BettyG See Profile I'm a Fan of BettyG permalink I agree about Rear Window, I watch it every time it's on TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm also not in love with Vertigo -- JamesStewart's obsession gets a bit hard to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I love "To Catch a Theif" too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's fun, and I guess I like Grace Kelly best as the heroine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be logged in to reply to this comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Log in or Led Zeppelin Movies Musicals Nirvana Russia TV Shows Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 10:53 AM on 11/21/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 07:45 AM on 11/21/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:36 PM on 11/20/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:10 PM on 11/20/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:06 PM on 11/20/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 04:03 PM on 11/20/2007 Favorite Flag as abusive Posted 03:56 PM on 11/20/2007Michael Giltz: DVDs: Hitchcock's Best Movie http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-hitchcocks-best-mo_b_73546.html [4/5/2009 8:26:48 PM] HOME POLITICS MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIVING GREEN STYLE WORLD CHICAGO COMEDY FUNDRACE ARCHIVE Advertise | Login | Make HuffPost your Home Page | RSS | Jobs | FAQ: Comments &amp; Moderation | FAQ: Huffpost Accounts | Contact Us Copyright © 2009 HuffingtonPost.com, Inc. | Archive | User Agreement | Privacy | Comment Policy | About Us | Powered by Movable Type</p>
