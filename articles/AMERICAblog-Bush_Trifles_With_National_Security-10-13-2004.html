                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , O C T O B E R 1 3 , 2 0 0 4Bush Trifles With National Securityby Michael in New York on 10/13/2004 01:53:00 AMHere are some of Bush's LATEST failures on national security.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funds to defend our nation are still being treated as a money potto win votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times reports desperately needed moneyis still streaming out to rural states that have virtually no need for it.Alaska is so rich in funds and has so little need for it (is Al Quaedagoing to send suicide bombers into the tundra?) that the governorsuggested they use their money to buy a jet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, mostcontainers coming into this country remain unchecked, our bordersare porous, etc.Doling out money wisely where security demands it? Not as importantas greasing the palms of friendly governors and certainly not asimportant as Bush's reelection.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's snide attitude has cost us respect with our allies and hishatred for the UN, the Geneva Convention and decency towards thevanquished (Abu Ghraib) has made the world see us as hyprocrites.The New York Times details Bush's failings at building relations withthe rest of the free world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's former foreign minister says sadlythat Bush became aloof, brusque and abrasive."It is a characterization of Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush's foreign policy style often heardaround the world: bullying, unreceptive, brazen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result, critics ofthis administration contend, has been a disastrous loss ofinternational support, damage to American credibility, the sullying ofAmerica's image and a devastating war that has already taken morethan 1,000 American lives."Rice's defensive defense? We're buddies with Russia and Czar Putin,who has used terror to dominate minorities under his domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'rebuddies with China, which tortures and kills dissidents and nutty cultpeople who want to meditate a la Falun Gong because they seeanything they can't control as a danger (that's when they're notwiping out the Tibetans).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And we're buddies with Pakistan, which ofcourse is the world's preeminent seller of nuclear-building materialand know-how to terrorists and terrorist states.Mending fences with long-term allies and getting them to invest (inevery way) in the success of our mission in Iraq? Not as important asBush's reelection.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush avoids dealing with Iran because it might look "soft." Yep,major progress could be made with Iran, but Bush would rather waittill after the election to make the deal that's out there (one laden withincentives a la the Clinton deal with North Korea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major nuclearthreat? Not as important as Bush's reelection.This ties in with Bush's refusal to let the troops do their job andregain control of cities in Iraq controlled by insurgents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The militaryshould have acted months ago to let things stabilize before theJanuary elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides, every day you let the insurgents stay incontrol of huge chunks of Iraq is another day where allies getdisheartened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Bush was afraid death tolls and bloody fightingwould look bad before the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A stable, free Iraq with validelections in which much of the country is quiet and the Sunnisactually participate? Not as important as Bush's reelection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MORE POSTS ABOUT: TORTURE Daily KosObama and Holder, Release the Torture Memos -We've two competing stories for why AG EricHolder has requested another delay in the court-imposed deadline for releasing three key Bush OLCtorture mem...6 minutes agoFiredoglakeConyers Explains Failure to Impeach - The HouseCommittee on the Judiciary Majority Staff haswritten a Final Report to Chairman John Conyers,Jr. last month (March 2009), REINING IN THEIMPERI...43 minutes agoHuffPost PoliticsAllison Kilkenny: Obama, Nukes, and the World -While Obama's pursuit of nuclear disarmamentwould be noble, double standards, favoritism, andfear-mongering are cancerous elements that robthe U.S. of res...48 minutes agoEschatonBig Shitpile - Still growing...59 minutes agoCrooks and LiarsNCAA Basketball Open Thread - Satire from TheOnion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yeah, yer brackets are in the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Openthread for the NCAA Championship game, a regularopen thread appears at 8:30 Pacific Ti...1 hour agoJ O H N ' S P H OT O S Show All Did Jesus Christ Exist?
