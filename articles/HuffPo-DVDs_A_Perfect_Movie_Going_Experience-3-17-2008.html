(Dancing spoons? Bah!) And once in a while, you see the right movie at the right timewith the right audience (and maybe even the right weather) and the experience is just...perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It happened to me when I stumbled into Woody Allen's The Purple Rose Of Cairo in a near-empty movie theater and didn't know the first thing about the plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It happened again when I saw Jane Campion's The Piano at an early screening before all the hype with a friend who was just as enthralled as I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And it happened again with Ang Lee's The Ice Storm($39.95; Criterion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was already a big fan of Lee,who was in the midst of a near-perfect run of films, starting with the crowd-pleasing comedy The Wedding Banquet, the mature and far more accomplished Eat Drink Man Woman, the marvelous Sense &amp; Sensibility and then this pitch perfect Seventies drama with a young Tobey Maguire on the verge of stardom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Don't ask me how I missed one of the eary screenings or its premiere at the New York Film Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So here it was, a cold and rainy night in New York City, probably in October orNovember of 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd just seen an awful movie at a screening I did make and should have skipped.Nothing puts you in a bad mood faster than a movie that makes you feel you've wasted your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iwas stalking up Broadway towards my home when I spotted The Ice Storm playing at Lincoln Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I checked the time and it was just about to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Popular Stories on HuffPost Fashion Face-Off!

I vaguely remembered him from This Boy's Life but I would never forget him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Everyone sat in silence as the credits rolled and then we bundled up and stepped outside into the rain, each of us alone, wet, tired...and happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also out this week: Jerry Seinfeld's modestly successful hybrid of an animated flick, Bee Movie ($29.98; DreamWorks); Battlestar: Galactica Season Three ($59.98; Universal) and yes, watching key episodes again does remind you this was a near disastrous collapse creatively but loads ofextras and the talented cast make you hopeful they can pull it together for the fourth and finalseason starting April 4; the Oscar-winning Coen brothers triumph No Country For Old Men($29.99; Miramax), which is not all that but is still a respectable Best Picture winner; South Park:Imaginationland ($19.99; Paramount) an extended version of the three part cliffhanger that's very, very funny and makes you wonder yet again why they haven't made another feature film;Atonement ($29.98; Universal), the nicely made period drama that finally - finally! - has turned the charming James McAvoy into a leading man; Tongues Untied ($29.99; Frameline), the groundbreaking documentary about the dual blasts of prejudice that black gay men must endure;Will Smith may not have done himself any favors with his stiff portrayal of a black gay con artist inSix Degrees of Separation but he later became the biggest movie star in the world and holds the screen handily in I Am Legend ($34.99; Warner Bros.) until it slowly deflates at the end; Pucca: Ninjas Love Noodles ($14.99; Shout), one of several Pucca compilations containing 13 episodes that combine The Powerpuff Girls with a romance manga in a truly offbeat, cross-cultural jumble; director Tony Kaye's hard to watch and harder to forget abortion rights epic Lake Of Fire ($27.98; ThinkFilm); Amy Adams' breakthrough Enchanted ($29.99; Disney), a gentle spoof of animated musicals; 101 Dalmatians ($29.99; Disney), the solid, second-tier animated flick with a fun villain and one enduring song; the absorbing "missing mother" UK miniseries Five Days ($29.98; HBO); Al Pacino acting up a storm in his Seventies salad day vehicles Bobby Deerfield ($19.94; Columbia/Warner Bros.) and the legal potboiler ...And Justice For All ($19.94; Columbia) ("No,YOU'RE out of order!"); Javier Bardem's well-intentioned but stillborn adaptation of Love In TheTime Of Cholera ($27.98; New Line); Click Clack Moo Cows That Type ($14.95; Scholastic/New Video), the latest in gently illustrated classic stories (eight in all on this disc) narrated with verve byRandy Travis, Helen Hunt, Tim Curry and others; Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation($26.98; Fox), the not-a-moment-too-soon 2008 straight to DVD sequel to the Tom Hankscomedy released 24 years ago; and for horror buffs who can't wait till Halloween and Saw XVIII(or whatever), there's the creepy collection 8 Films To Die For After Dark Horrorfest ($159.84;LionsGate), available as a boxed set or as individual titles like Crazy Eights ($19.98; LionsGate), which combines the nostalgia of a Big Chill -like reunion with...murder! So do you have a perfect movie-going experience, some combination of the people you were with, the setting (maybe a drive-in?), your mood and the movie that created an ideal moment?
