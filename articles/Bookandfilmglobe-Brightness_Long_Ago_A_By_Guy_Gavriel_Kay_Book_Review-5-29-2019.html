                <p>Tuesday, June 18, 2019  FICTION ‘A Brightness Long Ago’ Guy Gavriel Kay’s Novels are Historical Fiction About a World Almost Like Our Own  May 29, 2019 Michael Giltz I waited years before finding the right moment to dive into the work of Canadian author Guy Gavriel Kay .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2016, I finally read his stand-alone historical (?) novel Children Of Earth And Sky , which takes place in a time akin to the 1400s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was terrific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now I’ve just finished A Brightness Long Ago .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrific again! It’s sure to be one of my favorite books of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The books don’t quite read like Alexandre Dumas, but that’s the easiest comparison I can make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kay’s novels boast the pleasures of a strong plot, duels, battles, romance, poison-kissed assassins, and young heroes naively rubbing shoulders with the mighty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Add a layer of thoughtfulness and a casual reflection on the vagariesof life, and you’ve got Kay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brightness is a little more focused than the sprawling cast of characters in Children Of Earth And Sky .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here Kay tells the story mostly through the actions of Danio Cerra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Born into the merchant class, Danio’s smarts and luck gain him access to one of the most famous schools of the age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His training there leads to his placement in the court of a brutal ruler nicknamed The Beast, known for raping and killing young women and men on a whim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when business is good, the country stable and the Beastotherwise reasonable, the aristocracy looks the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One night, so does Danio when he realizes the Beast’s latest “victim” is not some trembling farm girl but likely an assassin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danio looks the other way instead of raising an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He then impulsively helps the woman escape into the night when she finishes her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kay doesn’t paint Danio’s action in some dashing, noble light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Danio knowsfull well his choice means the death of The Beast, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also means his friend at court, the mandirectly responsible for security, will die as well, which is bad but unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On further consideration, itmight also mean the death of a very young heir apparent, since small children coming into power rarely growinto manhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moment comes, Danio acts, and the repercussions spread throughout the rest of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before we know it, Danio finds himself a pawn of sorts, caught in the middle of a fierce battle between two mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One ishandsome and dashing and the other squat and disfigured, but both are excellent leaders of men, relativelydecent…and determined to see the other man die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Toss in that female assassin (who is of course beautiful, noble-born and daring to boot), a healer named Jelena determined to make her own way in the world, and about a dozen other vivid characters both major and minor,and you’ve got yourself a doozy of a story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Different Worlds I referred to Kay as writing an historical (?) novel since peopleusually describe him as a writer of fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His breakthrough workwas a trilogy known as The Fionavar Tapestry, in the classicfantasy mode (The series has since expanded to four books).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ever since, however, Kay has delivered novels that draw inspiration from our world’s past without being beholden to it.Typically, here he calls Venice Seressa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The city of Constantinoplebecomes Sarantium, besieged (from a Western perspective) by theAsharites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even the two mercenaries locked in mortal hatred have a basis in Italian history, namely Federico Montefeltro and SigismondoMalatesta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kay describes himself as using “history as a scaffold forinvention.” So history buffs will note many parallels betweenKay’s novel and the real world, but can never rest assured theyknow exactly how things will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why bother; why not just write a work of historical fiction? Kay’s approach pays dividends by allowing me to experience the shockof an event in history more fully than I ever imagined it before.The simple act of renaming places and times left me blissfullyGuy Gavriel Kayunaware of what to expect, something unlikely to occur if I were reading, say, a novel faithfully based on the War Of The Roses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even better, he creates characters so rich and diverting that the death of even a minor one will knock you for a loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And sincethey’re all “made up,” no one can complain the author changed thefate of some real world nobleman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kay is also wonderful atshowing a character come into his or her own, like the High Patriarch (Pope) suddenly taking his faith seriously,or the foppish aristocrat starting to care about his place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More broadly, Kay acknowledges the randomness of life, how a brief moment or impulse can branch you off forever into an unexpected and perhaps unwelcome direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That perspective makes this grand adventure quitemoving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kay never lets you forget the real cost of everything that happens, from war to love to decidingwhether to catch up with the large party on the road ahead of you or take a side path and go around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thechoice matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s quite a feat to be rousing, amusing and thoughtful all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kay manages this so often because he’s not trapped in a world of the past where we already know how it all turns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His novels feel “real” because of hisartistry and not because they got the dates and clothing and geography right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps it doesn’t matter whatnames you give to a city or time, whether inspired by the Tang Dynasty (his novel Under Heaven), Wessex/England during the Viking Invasions (his novel The Last Light Of The Sun) or even Fionavar (Kay’s← San Francisco on Shaky Ground Shows That Made the Hit Parade → High In the Air (An Everest Novel)  February 13, 2013 A Good Book by a GoodGuy  January 6, 2015own “first of all worlds,” depicted in The Fionavar Tapestry).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe, after all, every novel is a work of fantasy.(Berkley, May 14, 2019) Tags: A Brightness Long Ago , Children Of Earth and Sky , Guy Gavriel Kay Michael Giltz Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in New York City covering all areas of entertainment, politics, sports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has written extensively for the New York Post, New York DailyNews, New York Magazine, The Advocate, Out, Huffington Post, Premiere Magazine,Entertainment Weekly, BookFilter, USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He co-hosts the long-running podcast Showbiz Sandbox . You May Also LikeThe Apex of My Audiobook Addiction  December 4, 2013 Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * WebsiteSubscribe to our mailing list Social Twitter Facebook Recent Posts Tales of the Kinda Shitty Drug Dorks of Germany A Porpoise-Driven Life The French New Wave at 60Men In Blech Recent Comments Ken Kurson on Tales of the Kinda Shitty Morgan Thomas on Is Molly Ringwald a Good Translator?
