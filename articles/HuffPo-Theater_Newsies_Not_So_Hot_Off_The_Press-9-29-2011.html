Jack is tempted to abandon his pals and follow the dream of a better life out West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he rallies the lads, Katherine writes the front page story and soon the entire city knows about the horrible working conditions for kids all over the city and the newsies that have taken on the powerful Pulitzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's as squeaky clean and wholesome as you'd expect from a show drawn from a Disney film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boys are living rough on the streets, but their clothes are so neat and the lads so fresh-faced (despite a smudgehere and there) they look ready for church on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The talk is of unionizing, but impressionable youth in the audience are more likely to be drawn to musical theatre than fighting for workplace rights. (On the other hand, take kids to this and Billy Elliot and Les Miserables and they might just get radicalized after all.) Jeremy Jordan is our hero Jack. (He's also due to star on Broadway soon in the musical Bonnie &amp; Clyde .) He and Lindsey handle their paper-thin roles with ease, not a simple task when the story is filled in with such broad strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan has a solid voice that gets stronger the more he emotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsey on the other hand has a tendency to a harsh or strident tone when belting it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they're both personable and the biggest reason the show goes by painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anker - the actress with a heart of gold -- makes the most outof her comic number "Don't Come A-Knockin'," though costume designer Jess Goldstein is at fault for hewing too closely to Disney's sexless vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Medda's stage costume should be sexy and fun, not frumpy and saggy, especially when the actress playing her is a knockout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, this production is impressively full scale and ready for Broadway on a technical level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the show itself still needs a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It feels both thin and over-stuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One big reason are the songs: itfeels like there are more reprises than actual numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The four from the movie are fine but unfortunately they are not matched or outshone by any of the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, we end up with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe I missed a passing reference, but why does Jack romanticize Santa Fe? Did he read about it? See it in a movie? Meet a guy who was headed there? It's his dream so it would be nice to know where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And what's his relationship with Medda? She's clearly a mother figure, but we have no idea in what way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did she hide him from the copsor give him food when he was hungry? None of the other newsies move beyond a type -- the toughs, the cripple, the kids from good homes (they've got TWO parents) suddenly having to support their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How about a song where the kids sell newspapers and deliver the headlines of the day? Or another wheresome of them take center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Joseph Pulitzer is going to be the villain of the piece, he should do something truly villainous or at least become more complicated and interesting than the paper tiger he remains here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Show Jack's growth as athinker and Davey's growth as a fighter more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Davey -- played nicely by Ben Fankhauser -- is the kid from a stable home and the intellectual of the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The songs need more work, along with the choreography by Christopher Gattelli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Act Two has a rousing opener with "King Of New York." But it'shard to tell if the eager cast of performers is simply not razor tight or whether Gattelli is going for a loose, unprecise vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In any case, something is off because too often the performers seem ever so slightly out of sync.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2 Fox News Viewers Know Less Than People Who Watch No News: Study Charlie Angus What if They Declared an Emergency and No One Came?
