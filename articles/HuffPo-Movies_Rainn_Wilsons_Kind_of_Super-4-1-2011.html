'The Greatest Movie Ever Sold': Morgan Spurlock...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsay Lohan Quickly Released From Jail After...Comic bookstore geek Ellen Page becomes his VERY enthusiastic sidekick, and the tone veers wildly as Wilson goes from meek to freak, beating up thugs but also mauling a guy for cutting in line at the cinema.(Actually, the guy was meeting a friend, I think, so it doesn't even count as really cutting in the firstplace.) The movie is a little unsure of itself tonally because it doesn't quite know what it thinks of its protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it is weirdly amusing and has cult favorite written all over it for a certain demographic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More negatively, Wilson (quite funny on The Office ) just isn't up to the dramatic demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A scene where he curses God for making him such an unattractive loser should be piercing but just isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm sure thisproject was in the works long before Kick-Ass came to life and they must hate being compared unfavorably to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sometimes even superheroes can't catch a break. ***** Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox, a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's available free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow Michael Giltz on Twitter: www.twitter.com/michaelgiltz More in Entertainment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sponsored Links SHOCKING: 46" LCD TVs for $54.09 Today ONLY: Unique site sells 46" LCD TVs for up to 98% off retail price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SmartStyleLiving.com Mom Is 55, Looks 30...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Her clever $5 wrinkle therapy angers Botox Doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Find Out How!
