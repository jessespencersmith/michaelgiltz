                <p>MONDAY, OCTOBER 07, 2019 THEATER: The Not-So "Great Society" THE GREAT SOCIETY ** out of **** VIVIAN BEAUMONT THEATER AT LINCOLN CENTER Just as the odds were always stacked against politician Lyndon Baines Johnson, they're stacked against the new Broadway play The GreatSociety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a sequel or, if you prefer, a companion piece to the Tony- winning drama All The Way .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, Robert Schenkkan's All The Way lasered in on one of LBJ's greatest achievements: the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.That was a crowning achievement of Johnson's life and indeed in many ways the life of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And a drama about its passage allowed that political animal to charm, cajole, arm-twist, maneuver,manipulate and scheme scheme scheme...but in the service, for once,of the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine Richard III, but with our best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then have this complicated man played in scenery-chewing Technicolor by actor Bryan Cranston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All The Way had plenty of flaws, delivering history and major characters in a breathless, un-nuanced rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But LBJ was a hell of a lot of fun to watch as he towered over and dominated everyone around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder All The Way scored Tonys for both Best Actor and Best Play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now here comes The Great Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the fun and the victories are over.Here LBJ is smaller in every way. (And not just because the excellent actor Brian Cox is a few inches shorter than Cranston -- they're bothshorter than the lumbering LBJ, after all.) The President is beleaguered on all sides, pushed this way and that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy outflank him on the left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dixiecratsand the Republicans snipe at him from the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead of controllingevents, he is overwhelmed by them.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE ▼ 2019 (71) ▼ October (9) THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On Shaky GroundAnd every step he takes, this tragic figure sinks deeper and deeper into the muck and mire of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Great Society covers a lot of history and features 50 or so speaking parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But what will youremember? The simple, devastating tally of the wounded and dead US soldiers in that war, numbers that mount higher and higher and higher all night long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plays don't have to be about triumphs to be good, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But anexuberant main character can paper over a lot of flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not this time.A pallid, helpless LBJ squawks and complains and bickers and fights.But he doesn't hold your attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with All The Way, other characters dominate the action for lengthy stretches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happily, LBJwasn't the only hero of that drama, not with MLK inspiring andcampaigning and demanding equal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet here MLK (a fine Grantham Coleman) is just as beset as LBJ, with Stokely Carmichael drawing the spotlight with his own more fiery rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bobby Kennedy might have been a fine foil for Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buttheir almost animalistic hatred of each other is only glancingly coveredhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bryce Pinkham is a compelling presence, but that's all he can be.The actor spends much of the play simply sitting and watching, until history cruelly sidelines Bobby forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many good actors tackle multiple roles to little or no effect, with even Richard Thomas barely registering as Vice President Hubert Humphrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You sense the play sort of suggesting how LBJ twists Humphrey around his finger, sometimes slapping the man down andother times pretending they're a team and how LBJ really needs him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As with so much else here, that idea is telegraphed and described, butnever comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor does the play, which pinballs from one major event to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's all glancingly done, with each moment in history having almost theTHEATER: "The Glass Menagerie" Sans Tricks Or Trea...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: Wrestling With Faith in "Heroes Of The Fo...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: A Bright Future In Reach For "Chasing Rai...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: The Not-So "Great Society" THEATER: BOO!
