(And one more person Simon should keep in mind when staffing The X Factor .) The only missing element to make his guest stint perfect? A sexy male contestant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Simon and Randy get to fawn over any women they find appealing, it would have been fun to see Neil sparked by one of the guys who came in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe Jonas was the other guest judge and he proved that hordes of screaming fans have taught him theuseful skill of maintaining a polite persona during insanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Otherwise, he barely was seen making a comment, much less a memorable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Probably just too polite to make good TV, I imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, after the ghastly dearth of talent in Los Angeles, it was a relief to come to Dallas and discover 31 people worthy of going to Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To no one's surprise, some of them had tear-jerking backstories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LLOYD THOMAS -- Sang "Overjoyed," perhaps the last great pop tune written by Stevie Wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We saw Lloyd with his family and working the docks as a manual laborer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And though his performance was fine, Neil Patrick Harris was succinct in saying he wished Lloyd showed as much personality in hissinging as he did before and after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, a winning personality can't hurt down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KIMBERLY CARVER -- Sang an original, one of a shocking number of people who chose to do this very unwise option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People, you may have written a very good song (not likely, but possible), but surely there's a pop classic out there that might just be slightly better and therefore a smarter bet when auditioning? This ain't Nashville Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, Kimberly had a nice jazzy sort of voice, though a bitcabaret as Simon might have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Randy Neil and Kara sent her through with Simon dismissing her MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOSTBIG NEWS: Ellen Degeneres | LeAnn Rimes | Levi Johnston | Movies | Smarter Ideas | More...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOG IN | SIGN UP Get Entertainment Alerts Email Comments Don't Miss Tonight's Rare Full Moon Eclipse Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Passes Senate Procedural Vote WATCH LIVE: Rare Lunar Eclipse On Winter Solstice Timothy Karr Obama FCC Caves on Net Neutrality -- Tuesday...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Al Franken The Most Important Free Speech Issue of Our Time PHOTOS: 10 Things We've Accidentally Learned From Crime Dramas Sarah Palin Jabs Michelle Obama's Anti-Obesity Campaign Like 40K Like 40K Like 7K Like 9K Like 11K Like 1K Like 5K as too one-note in her style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though of course that hasn't stopped country gal Carrie Underwood, rocker Chris Daughtry et al from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ERICA RHODES -- Sang "Free Your Mind" by En Vogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the former kiddie star on Barney &amp; Friends who showed up in a leather outfit and with a whip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; God knows the kooks who think a Let's Make A Deal costume will help their chances don't need any encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fortunately, her sweet personality made it less of a stunt than it might have been and she can actually sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In this case, I'd say the singing overcame the gimmick of her outfit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A light pop voice (just like her idol Janet Jackson), cute and with lots of charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVE PITTMAN -- Sang "Bring It On Home To Me" by Sam Cooke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dave has Tourette's, which means he sometimes has facial tics (like eyes blinking and head movements and throat clearing) but says that all disappears when he sings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was solid and his looks grew on me while he chatted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the camera cutaway once or twice when his twitching became notable as he talked and the judges discussed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Got through but it's possible that on live TV Tourette's could prove a stumbling block in making people comfortable with him -- or humanize him and make people root for him more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Done with empathy, but not a sympathy vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TODRICK HALL -- Another original song? Oy! And yet, this one had Idol -specific lines that were relatively clever and cute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Appeared on Broadway (credited as Todrick D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hall) in the role of Bobby in The Color Purple during Fantasia's acclaimed run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has a limited but appealing and distinctive voice with loads of confidence and experience in front of live audiences that could serve him well if he makes itthat far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAEGAN WRIGHT -- Sang "To Make You Feel My Love," which was written by Bob Dylan and covered by a gazillion people and is the last charting single (to date, I won't give up hope) by Billy Joel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maegan's backstory is that...her parents divorced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really? Is that even worth mentioning in this day and age? Still, she seems to have custody of her little brother, though I didn't catch that if it were spelled out.To me, she seemed rather tentative and colorless on the low notes but finally gained a little steam (as shegot louder) towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judges all liked her more than me, but even listening again I didn't quite hear it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHRISTIAN SPEAR -- Sang "All I Could Do Was Cry," the breakthrough hit by Etta James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spear fought off leukemia at eight years old, which explains why the judges called someone they just met very brave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good for her, of course, but I really didn't think much of her performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was very hard tofollow the words she was singing (a sure sign of someone who isn't paying attention to the lyrics but just following the melody), stopped for a moment in the middle of lines and was generally loud but not especially good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the plus side, she didn't oversing, especially for a 16 year old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I would have said, keeppracticing and sing whenever and wherever you can and come back in two years, but the judges sailedher through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So what did you think of NPH and Joe Jonas as judges? And what about the people who got through?
