                <p>Scott Glenn was in an out-of-the-way part of Nicaragua, cut off from the outside world, working as hard as he had in y·ears. .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And yet he felt spoiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glenn was teamed . with director Ken Loach on the political drama "Carla's Song," and he reveled in Loach's unorthodox approach to filmmak­ ing, which combines imprmisation with a thorough exploration of every character. "The experience of working with Ken was so unique and powerful," says Glenn. "I said to someone there, 'I can't go into another movie right after this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'd get firedl I'd spend the whole time say'ing, \ Vhy can't you sh()('lt the \I'hoil: thint: in sequence: \'Vhy Cln't we do major sCenes that ,lren't going to appear in the final film juSt to know where our ch;lr;lCters ;lre: \ \ 1w can't . . we impro\;ise" "So this person said, "\ Veil, \lhn do you W,lnt to do:' And I sOlid, 'The'ltre.""
