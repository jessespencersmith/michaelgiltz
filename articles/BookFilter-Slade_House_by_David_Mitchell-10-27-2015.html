(And which may explain why most typical horror fare does not maketheir victims so believable: it's not as fun to watch real people die.) But he stumbles on the inevitable twist, both to theperspective of the villains and the vampire-hunters (for lack of a better word) that track them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I was a little confusedby the "rules" of this world (specifically how victims could linger and help others fight back).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I didn't want those rulesspelled out but I wanted to believe the author knew them and abided by them, but I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the ending is just notsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he's too good a writer not to give this ghost story some genuine creeps and real pathos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first fewsections in particular are full engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he maintains your allegiance by wondering what Mitchell will do next. --Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Devilishly fun.”—The Washington Post “Entertainingly eerie . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Slade House boils down to [David] Mitchell’s take on the classic ghost story, complete withhis version of a haunted house. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The last thing we expected from Mitchell is simplicity, but here it is, burnished toa hellish bronze.”—Chicago Tribune “A ripping yarn . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Shirley Jackson’s Hill House or the Overlook Hotel from Stephen King’s The Shining, [SladeHouse] is a thin sliver of hell designed to entrap the unwary. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the Mitchellverse grows ever more expansive andconnected, this short but powerful novel hints at still more marvels to come.”—San Francisco Chronicle“Like Stephen King in a fever . . . manically ingenious.”—The Guardian (U.K.) “Slade House, the tricky new confection by David Mitchell, is a haunted house story that savors of Dickens, Stephen</p>
