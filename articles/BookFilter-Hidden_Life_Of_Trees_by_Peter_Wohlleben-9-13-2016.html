And that mischievous description of trees in the subtitle -- what they "feel," how they "communicate?" It's not so fanciful, but apparently grounded in the latest scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trees do in fact communicate with themselves and others (via scent and electrical impulses and sound and intermediaries).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They tend to their young.Share This Book About The Author Peter Wohlleben, Tim Flannery Peter Wohlleben spent over twenty years working for the forestry commission in Germany before leaving to put his ideas ofecology into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He now runs anenvironmentally-friendly woodland inGermany, where he is working for the return of primeval forests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is the author of numerous books about trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Release Info List Price: $24.95 (Hardcover) Published: September 13, 2016 Publisher: Greystone Books Pages: 288 ISBN 10: 1771642483 ISBN 13: 9781771642484They share resources with other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their roots are mind-blowingly extensive and along with fungi it amounts to an underground "internet" that has been dubbed the wood wide web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists are just now tracing how nutrients pass back and forth among competitive trees in a dance of mutuality, to give just one tiny example from the afterword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter clearly and directly spells out what is going on during storms and in "plantation" forests and trees growing in urban environments, urging you to open your eyes the next time you enter a real forest and look for things like forked trunks and young beechesbiding their time in the shadow of larger species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His insights are never loaded with scientific jargon and hisanthropomorphism is playful and inviting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This ramble is so plotless one should become impatient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Except every little chapter is simply bursting with fascinating detail, like the way rain water pours down the trunks of some trees and is shunted aside by the conifers of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Or what to look for in the bark of trees and why branches rarely grow close to theground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trees, like ents, work on a very different time scale than us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But "slow" does not mean trees are objects, likerocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are more like animals than the easy categorization of "plants"and "animals" would have one believe, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bythe end, you'll be inclined to agree a lot more than you did at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frankly, I was relieved to be holding an e- reader -- having a print edition of this work (made out of the pulp of dead trees!) would seem almost...rude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm no naturist but this book is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My one complaint is that it features just a few simple drawings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I wanted hundreds of them or preferably photographs illuminating what Peter is telling us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already a big bestseller in Europe, I've no doubt this couldcapture the imagination in the US as well and a fully illustrated edition might follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And I hope someone puts it in the hands of the team behind the documentary film "Blue Planet" and its like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As crazy as it sounds, a documentary film about trees should be just as exciting as all those nature movies where hunter stalks prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's eye-opening, sweet-natured(literally) and filled with information that makes you want to pause and say to the person next to you, "Hey, did you knowtrees can...?" -- Michael Giltz What Others Say "The matter-of-fact Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wohlleben has delighted readers and talk-show audiences alike with the news — long known to biologists — that trees in the forest are social beings." —Sally McGrane, The New York Times "If you read this book, I believe that forests will become magical places for you, too ." —Tim Flannery "Peter Wohlleben is a generous and knowledgeable guide into this fascinating and complex secret world hidden in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hidden Life of Trees is a powerful reminder to slow down and tune into the language of nature. " —Rachel Sussman, author of The Oldest Living Things in the World "Charming, provocative, fascinating .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the tradition of Jean-Henri Fabre and other great naturalist story- tellers, Wohlleben relates imaginative, enthralling tales of ecology."—David George Haskell, author of The Forest Unseen , Pulitzer finalist "Wohlleben’s book is at once romantic and scientific , beautifully articulating his personal relationship with the trees he has dedicated his life to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His view of the forest calls on us all to reevaluate our relationships with the plant world." —Daniel Chamovitz,… More What You Say Filter by No Reviews Found ..... about us |faq|advertise |privacy policy |newsletter |contact us ©2018, BookBuddha LLc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Rights Reserved.</p>
