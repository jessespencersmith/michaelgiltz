(In the film, that character of Max Schumacher is played by William Holden; here it's Tony Goldwyn.)Beale doesn't change or grow -- he has a breakdown and that's aboutit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, the same is true in this play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beale has a breakdown early on...and that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this time around he dominates theaction; in fact, whenever we interrupt his mania for a peek intoSchumacher's disintegrating marriage it's kind of a jolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh yeah, that's happening too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Beale's rants grow increasingly predictable in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playwright Hall jazzes up Beale's show a la the film with anelaborate new presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's given a late night talk show sort ofintro (rather than the sober air appropriate to a newsman) and an announcer and crew member urging applause give an elaborate spiel asking us to repeat Beale's catchphrase and then applaud loudly.That's fine once; it's even ok twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But when they do it again andagain and again it goes beyond making some sort of point and justfeels lazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They've made Beale the star of the show but they realize he has nothing to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If they're driving home the emptiness of the spectacle, well we got it the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cranston does what he can with the part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A skilled TV actor (as well asa Tony winning veteran of the stage), the part is in some ways perfectfor him (if only it were better).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He plays to the camera beautifully and if you feel drawn to watch him on one of the many video screens adorning the stage, well that makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After all, the TV iswhere Beale comes alive and that's rightly where Cranston pitches hisperformance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fans of the film may be aghast at how tepid the heart of the movie comes across here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldwyn and Tatiana Maslany of Orphan Blackcan do nothing with their doomed romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the corporate politicson display barely make an impression as the cameras whirl backThe Movies, Books, Theater, Concerts, CDs I Saw In...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TV and Film Must Watch List THEATER: "Network" Has A Star, But No Show THEATER: "The Prisoner" Can't Get Free THEATER: Ruben and Clay's Holiday TV Special (Minu...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOVIES: "Amazing" ArethaTHEATER: Time For Stoppard To Stop?; A "Prom" To F... â–º November (4) â–º October (6) â–º September (1) â–º May (5) â–º April (6) â–º March (4) â–º February (1) â–º 2017 (6) â–º 2016 (2) â–º 2015 (14) â–º 2014 (2) â–º 2013 (5) â–º 2012 (18) â–º 2011 (15) â–º 2010 (10) â–º 2009 (43) â–º 2008 (86) â–º 2007 (781) â–º 2006 (2412) â–º 2005 (5)around to another spiel from Howard Beale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are sideshow to the prophet and he is sideshow to the real star of the show and the real tragedy: the directorial vision of van Hove and his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For years now, van Hove and a crack team of production talent have dominated theater and opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here it's Jan Versweyveld (scenic and lighting design), Tal Yarden (video design), An D'huys (costumedesign) and Eric Sleichim (music and sound).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No matter what Van Hove tackles, it's sure to have a bold vision, a striking conceit that dominates his take on a classic of stage or screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You may not alwaysagree with his take on a piece (my personal favorite is his View FromThe Bridge as boxing match) but by God you had to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here they have come a cropper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As one might expect, this productionof Network includes lots of tv cameras, lots of video screens and a stage that usually includes an announcer's desk front and center with astudio booth on stage right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What one doesn't expect is that stage rightis dominated by...a bar facing the wall? With a few scattered tables and audience members who eat a meal while watching the show? And a couch from Schumacher's home? Now, the handful of audiencemembers sitting on stage -- almost as if by accident -- aren't a studioaudience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That would have made sense, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor are they people ina bar or restaurant who might be coached into becoming glued to TVsplaying in the bar when Beale goes on a rant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No, they're just sitting on stage, watching the show and eating dinner brought out by wait staff during set changes while we watch them and wonder what theheck they're doing up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bar is used in maybe one and a half scenes, including a very early one where Cranston and Goldwyn sidle up to the bar for a heart toheart and stand in a far, far corner with their backs to the audience(though of course we can watch them on camera).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other than a sex scene that took place either in the bar or somewhere else (I wasn't quite sure), I can't for the life of me imagine why they had the baronstage in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Making matters worse, the studio booth is sonarrow and cluttered (and so poorly covered by the cameras), thatvirtually nothing that happens in it is dramatically interesting or even visible, except for one brief line by Maslany late in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's literally a jumbled mess that's ignored 90% of the time and a deeplyawkward set when van Hove does try and stage some action there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In short, one third of the stage is taken up by a jumbled studio booth that's hard to see into, the other side of the stage is taken up by an unnecessary bar and theater goers are seated in the midst of this, chowing down on food and drinking wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that's not enough,multiple scenes are staged out of sight entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You can (almost)always see the actors on a video screen but you also waste a lot of time peering around the set, wondering where in fact the actors who are talking to one another might actually be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One scene is actually set infront of the theater for no good reason, though it was nice to see NewYorkers know enough to not look at a camera and just keep walking,even if Tony Goldwyn and Tatiana Maslany are making out in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's so...ugly, such a godawful mess, so unsatisfying and cluttered and so very, very different in every way from what van Hove and his team have done so many times before that it's hard to believe this wasstaged in London, they saw it...and then kept it intact for New York.What were they thinking? I haven't a clue but undoubtedly they werethinking of something and Cranston's magnetic if wasted turn as Beale let them think they were onto it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a final head-scratcher, the show ends, the cast takes its bow, the lights come up...and as the audience gathers its things, the video monitors begin to show news footage of Gerald Ford being sworn in as President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huh? Maybe it's a testament to thepower of TV or maybe the audience was just intrigued enough by thesheer randomness of this, but most everyone stayed put.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ford wasfollowed by Jimmy Carter being sworn in and he was followed by Ronald Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Well, it's clear where this is headed and you get no points for predicting like I did how the audience would react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GeorgeBush Sr. got some polite applause (since he'd just died) while BillClinton received notably modest clapping himself. (His stock has fallenhard in recent years.) George W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bush was mostly ignored, BarackObama of course received thunderous applause and Donald Trump even louder boos. (Except for one yahoo in the orchestra who applauded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tourists!) It was admittedly a fascinating bit of tracking the popularity of recent US Presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But surely if they wanted to make some point connected with the show we just saw, they should have shown footage of Geraldo Rivera and Jerry Springer and Glenn Beck breaking downin tears on air a la Howard Beale and Rush Limbaugh and Lou Dobbsand Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sure, theycould have ended with Trump though that seems too obvious to bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presidential swearing-in footage? It's just one more missing piece of the puzzle that is this messy, confused, mixed message of ashow from one of the most noteworthy talents in theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like Beale,van Hove might fall on his face sometimes, but he's never boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2018 Homelife/The Zoo Story (at Signature) *** out of **** Escape To Margaritaville ** Broadway By The Year: 1947 and 1966 *** Lobby Hero *** Frozen ** Rocktopia * Angels in America ** 1/2 Mean Girls ** 1/2 The Sting ** Mlima's Tale ** 1/2Children Of A Lesser God ** 1/2 Sancho: An Act Of Remembrance ** 1/2 The Metromaniacs *** Summer: The Donna Summer Musical * The Seafarer ** Henry V (Public Mobile Unit w Zenzi Williams) * 1/2 Saint Joan ** Travesties *** 1/2 Summer and Smoke ** 1/2 My Fair Lady ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1956 and 1975 ** 1/2 Bernhard/Hamlet * 1/2 On Beckett *** What The Constitution Means To Me ** The Winning Side * Oklahoma ** Mother Of The Maid * Love's Labour's Lost ** 1/2 The Lifespan of a Fact ** India Pale Ale * Thunderbodies *** The Ferryman *** 1/2 Eve's Song * King Kong * American Son * 1/2 The Resistible Rise Of Arturo Ui *** Mike Birbiglia's The New One *** The Hard Problem ** The Prom ** Ruben and Clay's First Annual Christmas Show ** The Prisoner ** Network * 1/2 Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Giltz is the creator of BookFilter, a book loverâ€™s best friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itâ€™s a website that lets you browse for books online the way you do in a physical bookstore, provides comprehensive info on new releases every week in every category and offers passionate personal recommendations every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heâ€™s also the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day with top journalists and opinion makers as guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itâ€™s available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visit Michael Giltz at his website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POSTED BY MICHAEL GILTZ AT 7:35 PM NO COMMENTS: Post a Comment Subscribe to: Post Comments (Atom)Newer Post Older Post Home</p>
