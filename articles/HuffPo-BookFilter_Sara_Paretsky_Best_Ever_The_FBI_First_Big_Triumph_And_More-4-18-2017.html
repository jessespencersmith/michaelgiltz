Welcome to our latest Top Picks Of The Week ! Our laptop was in the laptop hospital for two weeks but it's all better now. (An apple a day keeps the Apple doctor away?) Thanks to those emailing to make sure all was well and wondering where the heck the newsletter might be!

Still, she's been name- checked by Stieg Larsson in his Lisbeth Salander series and praised by the late, great PD James along with many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now comes her 19th entry in the V.I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warshawski series and the enthusiastic blurbs from her compatriots are pretty breath-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee Child calls it her best yet, Harlan Coben says if you've never read her now is the time to jump in and Karin Slaughter calls this particular novel astonishing and Paretsky one of the all-time greats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is it possible....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Mystery, Crime &amp; Thrillers? We've Curated 16 of The Best New Books Out Now! ***************THE PHENOMENON by Rick Ankiel and Tim Brown Has any other sport inspired more great fiction and nonfiction than baseball? Unless there's some massive body of great cricketing novels out there, we doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So it's telling that sportscaster Bob Costas praises this real-life tale of a young baseball pitcher who crashes and burns and then rises from the ashes as a major league batter for eleven seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He tells his story with veteran sportswriter Tim Brown, revealing a life of private demons, professional jinxes and personal triumphs that will appeal even to readers who don't have a passionate opinion on the DH....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Sports? We've Chosen 6 Books To Compete For Your Attention! Love Biography? We've Found 20 Lives Worth Experiencing In New Books Just Out Now! ***************SPOILS by Brian Van Reet It took about 15 years after the Fall Of Saigon in 1975 for some of the classic works about that tragic war to come to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The nonfiction masterpiece A Bright Shining Lie came out in 1988 and Tim O'Brien's masterful short story collection The Things They Carried arrived in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Right on schedule, we're finding one acclaimed work after another about Iraq and Afghanistan hitting shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest is this acclaimed novel which tells thestory of both sides in the Iraqi occupation, ranging from a 19 year female gunner taken hostage to a long-time mujahedeen who is a little freaked out by the far more radical mujahedeen showing up now to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Time will tell where this and other works rank in history, but it's proving a fruitful harvest from a bitter conflict....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Fiction?

Step Into Someone Else's Shoes With These 20 Books Out Now! ***************WHEN THE WORLD STOPPED TO LISTEN by Stuart Isakoff In 1958, pianist Van Cliburn electrified the world by going behind the Iron Curtain and triumphing at a piano competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since shady scoring still happens today at international sporting events, you can imagine how unlikely that was at the height of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writer Stuart Isacoff -- the founder of the magazine Piano Today -- tells the story here, covering Van Cliburn's unlikely artistic career and the repercussions of that event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The story he presents is interesting and surely as thorough as we're likely to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isacoff is on firm ground when detailing the state of cultural exchange between the Soviet Union and the West in the 1950s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He is on less firm ground when detailing Cliburn's eccentric private life, surely in great part because the late Cliburn was not terribly forthcoming given the world he grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Cliburn may have been a sentimentalist, but his story needs someone less willing to overlook the sadder, more tragic moments....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love History? Dive Into The Past With Eight More Books Out Now! Love Pop Culture? Catch Our Picks For Ten More Buzzed About Books Out This Week! ***************ALL DAY by Liza Jessie Peterson When you're making a list of the toughest jobs in the world, surely one of the most demanding and rewarding would be walking into a classroom of ninth graders and trying to keep their attention on math and science and history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now imagine doing that with a class room of all boys...on Rikers Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poet and actress Peterson didjust that for one year, capturing both the tragedy of mass incarceration for juveniles, the frustration of being able to reach some of the young men enrolled in a class to get their GEDs and the triumph of watching as a precious few triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has a wide scope but never loses focus on the boys she works with in all their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dangerous Minds it isn't but one can easily imagine Hollywood to come calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Rikers Island is being shut down for good, they'll have an authentic location available right away....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read More.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Love Memoirs?
