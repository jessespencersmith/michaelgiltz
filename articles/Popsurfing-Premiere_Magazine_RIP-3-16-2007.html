                <p>F R I D AY, M A R C H 1 6 , 2 0 0 7Premiere Magazine R.I.P.Premiere Magazine is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a sad day for me, since so much of myNew York career began and still springs from my time at PremiereMagazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many magazines (Spy, 7 Days, Interview) it had itsheyday and influenced many others and then became a shadow of itsformer self.But I can still remember what a revelation Premiere was in 1987 whenit debuted with the Dan Ackroyd remake of "Dragnet" on the cover.Here was a magazine that talked about the movie industry and wassmart and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before Premiere, you could go to dusty academicjournals for dry essays or just get celebrity profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Premiere coveredthe entire movie business, profiling not just stars but agents andwriters and directors and publicity departments and managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It madethe business side of the movies entertaining and it took theentertaining side of the movies as seriously as the Wall Street Journalcovered business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People certainly went on the sets of films beforePremiere, but it made that journey a mainstay and Premiere didn't justvisit the set and take the guided tour -- it COVERED the making of amovie, complete with drama and excitement and battles over budgetsand casting and the fights that are a part of any business, all withoutdevolving into gossip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It took the work seriously, it took the artistsseriously and it wasn't a puff piece magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you behaved like a jerkon the set, Premiere would make that clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today, everyone goes onmovie sets all the time and expects to report faithfully what theyobserve, rather than just provide free publicity for the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Premiere isa big reason why.Premiere also did innovative articles like "Shot By Shot," whichdetailed how the special effects worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Behind-the-scenes talent likecomposers and cinematographers and costume and set designers andeditors and special effects guys -- the giants of the industry in theirfields -- got covered and profiled with as much professionalism andvigor as the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the stars were treated with dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Premierewould talk about their private lives but it was always in the context of ameaty profile and how it informed their work; not in the context ofwondering who they were sleeping with.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; C O MS U R F I N G T H E WAV E S O F P O P U L A R C U LT U R EB Y M I C H A E L G I LT Z &amp; F R I E N D SPOPSURFING.COM: Premiere Magazine R.I.P.http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/03/premiere-magazine-rip... 1 of 37/25/09 10:45 PMFAV O R I T E L I N K SAmericablogFive O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's BlogThe Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPNRadioCine-Blog -- George Robinson's BlogDocuments On Art &amp; Cinema - DarylChin's BlogBrucie G's Wondrous Blog OfAdventure and Mystery -- BruceGreenspan's BlogB L O G A R C H I V E▼ 2009 (17)▼ July (3)1939 -- The Greatest Year ForMoviesSwimming Bans Those Hi-TechSuits!Best Movies Of The Year -- TheMaster List► June (3)► May (1)► March (2)► February (1)► January (7)► 2008 (86)► 2007 (781)► 2006 (2412)► 2005 (5)C O N T R I B U TO R SAaronMichael in New YorkBiboy POPSURFING.COM: Premiere Magazine R.I.P.http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/03/premiere-magazine-rip... 2 of 37/25/09 10:45 PMPOPSURFING.COM: Premiere Magazine R.I.P.http://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2007/03/premiere-magazine-rip... 3 of 37/25/09 10:45 PM</p>
