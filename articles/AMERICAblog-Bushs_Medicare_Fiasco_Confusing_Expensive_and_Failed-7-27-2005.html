                <p>W E D N E S D A Y , J U L Y 2 7 , 2 0 0 5Bush's Medicare Fiasco: Confusing, Expensiveand Failedby Michael in New York on 7/27/2005 06:09:00 PMThat prescription drug program of Bush's is turning into a realfiasco -- and making Hillary Clinton's plan seem simple incomparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's USA Today's rundown of Bush's pitch toseniors:Before the morning was out, [senior citizen Myrtle]Anderson heard that some drug discount cards will stay ineffect, while others will expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That seniors who want thedrug benefit will have to choose from an array of insuranceplans that do not yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That each plan is likely to coverdifferent drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That co-payments will start at 25%, rise to100% and then drop to 5% as seniors' prescription billsmount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That those with low incomes and few assets can getextra help if they fill out a four-page, 16-questionapplication.Well, now that's cleared up, isn't it? If Myrtle can't understand it,most seniors won't be able to either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The problem is that Bush mustget the seniors who don't really need this program to sign up so theycan underwrite the seniors who DO need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even the seniors whodo need it can't figure the darn thing out.But Vicki DeRuggiero of the US Social Security Administration has aplan.After her presentation here, DeRuggiero and ahalf-dozen state and federal officials workedone-on-one with seniors to help determine theireligibility and potential benefits. "I've just found that thepersonal touch works," she said.Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As long as Bush can send a personal adviser to work directlywith each and every one of the tens of millions of seniors who areeligible, I'm sure we'll be able to clear this mess up.And here's an annoying postscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; USA Today wrote this:If the costs keep rising — the original $400 billionestimate for 2004-13 already has been adjusted toabout $720 billion for 2006-15 — the program will greatlyincrease the federal budget deficit.Uh, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does the MSM have the memory of an ADD child? Bush LIEDto Congress about the cost of the program in order to get it passed.He stopped the real numbers from being released because it barelymade the cut and if Congress had known the real cost (which iscertain to rise dramatically), it never would have passed in the firstplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a lie and created a scandal when it was uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thisshould have been reported factually as "Bush misled Congress whenoriginally getting the program passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He told Congress and theAmerican people it was estimated to cost $400 billion over the firstdecade when the real cost was dramatically higher -- $720 billion.Even that figure is now clearly much lower than the real cost."
