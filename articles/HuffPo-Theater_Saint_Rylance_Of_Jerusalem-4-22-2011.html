Comedy, drama, tragedy -- he handles itall with aplomb, often in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jez Butterworth's new drama Jerusalem gives Rylance a number of hilarious, gripping monologues and he makes the most of them, beguiling and charming and dazzlingus with Falstaffian ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You wouldn't want to missRylance in anything and certainly not in a solid new playthat has been praised to high heaven in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Italmost singlehandedly turned the Royal Court Theatreinto the hottest place in town (Pultizer Prize winner Clybourne Park, anyone?) and it's easy to see why, especially with Rylance at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rylance plays -- or rather embodies, brings to life, joyously animates -- Johnny "Rooster" Byron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hiscaravan is stranded in a public wood slowly encroached by new housing developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rooster is the sortof washed-up adult who always attracts teenagers and layabouts, kids looking to score some weed andhappy to be caught up in his Pied Piper antics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The mood is set with deadpan efficiency right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A young woman begins singing an angelic version of the unofficial UK national anthem "Jerusalem" only to have it overwhelmed by the raucousenergy of a rave featuring drunken, lascivious partying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

It also happens to be fair day, which is like a county fair in the US but far more important since everyone in town takes part in one way or another it seems, whether it's the local barkeep dressing up for a Morrisdance or Rooster once upon a time entertaining crowds with his Evil Knievel style daredevil stunts.Rooster has sired a little boy and has promised the lad to take him to fair day though by now even a sixyear old child knows not to depend on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rooster is far more likely to be caught up in the drama of hiscurrent favorite Lee (John Gallagher Jr.), a Lost Boy who is leaving for Australia the next day and wantsone final hurrah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mackenzie Crook (of the UK Office ) plays Ginger, the butt of everyone's jokes and Alan David is the Professor, a classics-quoting old fellow who trips on acid while observing the inevitabledecline of Rooster as modern society closes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Rooster is not just a gypsy-like wanderer who embraces life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He's also England personified, the wild animalistic raw England that has been tamed but still burns at the heart of this once world-conqueringEmpire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rooster will spellbind you with a story that begins with the casual comment that he met the guy who built Stonehenge and slowly, deliriously has you listening with open-mouthed pleasure at being taken for a ride while he mentions 80 foot tall giants (who can't always be trusted) and the golden drumthey gave him that he can pound on and call for their aid whenever he's in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Ginger tries yetagain to call Rooster on his whopping lies and wonders where exactly this golden drum he's braggingabout might be, Rooster trumps him by casually saying he's sitting on it, only to have Ginger leap up andeveryone gasp when a rug is removed and there indeed is a drum of impressive size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, it will bepounded on and yes, you'll wonder if maybe Rooster was telling the truth after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jerusalem is a solid work and no, it's not too English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An untrammeled romantic past versus a dull, middle class present is hardly a tension you can't grasp if you don't live in Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It didn't cut too deeply for me, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it seems like Lee has betrayed Rooster by growing up a la Prince Hal, I feltno pain or sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's clear from the start that Rooster is the sort of figure who can amaze you at 15 andseem a bit sad when you're 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watching Rooster be so hapless with his little son takes care of that ratherquickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even more confusing is the "missing" girl who has been hiding out from her step-father, thesame girl who sang "Jerusalem" at the top of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That step-dad may be molesting her, but it's notclear how we're supposed to feel when her fate is resolved after a tug of war between Rooster and thebastard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gallagher, an excellent actor, does well by Lee, though he has yet to find the rhythm of Lee's funniest scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Director Ian Rickson seamlessly melds the new Americans with the remaining UK cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sound design by Ian Dickinson for Autograph combined with the original music by Stephen Warbeck capturesnicely the tension between a dwindling nature and modern life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
