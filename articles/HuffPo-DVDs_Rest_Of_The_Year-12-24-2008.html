That would be The Women ($28.98; New Line), a seemingly foolproof idea -- remake the scathing, hilariously acerbic classic comedy about backbiting gals -- that took years to get going and then was somehow thoroughlybotched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO TURN THE SOUND OFF? Rowan Atkinson takes a lot of care with the sound mix, I'm sure but Mr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bean: The Ultimate Collection ($69.95; A&amp;E) gathers together all of the mostly silent comic's appearances, from the classic original TV series (the only thing casual fans really need) to the movies and even the animated spin-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST BEGINNING TO A CAREER THAT BEGAN IN 1996? Criterion offers it up in Bottle Rocket ($39.95; Criterion) , the charming little movie that set Wes Anderson on the road to the classic Rushmore and fine followups like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Their usual top-notch extras include the original short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooks and Polly Platt have individually and collectively mentored lots of great talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anderson is one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also just out is the impenetrable but confident Lars Von Trier film Europa ($39.95; Criterion), which contains audio commentary, a making-of documentary, interviews with Trier and others and more, as one expects from Criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO CHECK OUT EXTRAS? I'm actually not a big fan of extras, but Deadwood: The Complete Series ($179.97; HBO) has a couple of doozies, from creator David Milch's lacerating stroll through the empty set of the show he killed off too soon to Titus Welliver's hilarious imiations of Milch, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gosh, I miss this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASONS TO GET OVER YOUR FEAR OF DOCUMENTARIES? -- Sure, documentaries are wildly popular compared to 30 or 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But since a giant hit in the docu world is a movie that grosses $10 million, obviously a lot of you still avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That meansyou're missing out on the high school dissection American Teen ($29.99; Paramount) , the classic Cold War look The Atomic Cafe Collector's Edition ($39.95; Docurama), the marvelous political x- ray Frost/Nixon: The Original Watergate Interviews ($24.95; Liberation), the acclaimed World "Washington Unplugged" Arianna was on CBS' "Washington...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alex Leo The "Real Housewives Of New York City" Flowchart Of Hate I'm a little embarrassed tolove this show as much as...

If the titles are available individually, surelyfans already own some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And who is going to say they need these five particular films bythese five directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You might like Scorsese and Spielberg and John Huston -- but do you reallyneed a boxed set of Mean Streets, ET and Under The Volcano? It's just hard to imagine anysituation where any film buff would actually want to buy these five films at once and it seems theony reason it exists is because they owned all five and wanted an excuse to package them together.Five films by one director, sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five musicals or five gangster flicks, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But five random albeitgood movies by five different directors? It's too easy to say they're good guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This boxed set justmakes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST TITLES TO CONFUSE? I can't seem to keep Towelhead ($27.98; Warner Bros.), the indie film where Aaron Eckhart plays another patented creep and Baghead ($28.96; Sony), the bare bones horror spoof straight in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maybe if they were better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO IGNORE PETA? - Anyone seeing Maggie Cheung in leather in the Olivier Assayas witty film satire Irma Vep ($29.99; Zeitgeist)...well, animal cruelty would be the last thing on any person's mind.THE BEST REASON TO REWATCH THE BRITISH VERSION OF 'THE OFFICE?' -- It's true that the American version has proven to be far, far better than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But very few comedies can equal the UK show's originality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And seeing RIcky Gervais try to shoehorn himselfinto Hollywood flicks like Ghosttown ($29.98; Dreamworks) -- the harmless story of a guy who dies briefly and is haunted by Greg Kinnear simply makes you want to remind yourself thegreatness he is capable of when given free rein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO SING "TAKE A CHANCE, TAKE A CHANCE, TAKE A CHANCE?" -- Obviously, that would be the shaky, silly wildly successful ABBA movie Mamma Mia ($34.98; Universal), which continues to be an inexplicable but hard to get angry about success of the equally paper-thin stage musical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But hey, if this is what it takes to get the great MerylStreep a payday, I'm all for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And seeing James Bond (ie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pierce Brosnan) sing and dance is hardto beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST AND WORST REASONS TO GO OFF THE GRID? -- The best reason is the paranoid techno-thriller Eagle Eye ($34.98; Dreamworks), which can't offer up anything scarier than a computer that thinks it's human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it was a hit and Shia LaBeouf is the luckiest actor around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worst reason is Lost: Season Four ($59.99; Disney) because if you go off the grid that's where you could end up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some say the show regained its footing last year; I stll find it hard to dive back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK? The slow-burning comedies of the Coen Brothers always improve with time and repeated viewings and Burn After Reading ($29.98; Universal) (with Brad Pitt -- who is having a stellar year -- and George Clooney) is sure to be noexception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a year or two they'll call it a cult comedy and soon after that it'll get upgraded againand join the ranks of The Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING? -- The pioneering shorts of a groundbreaker care collected in The Early Works Of Cheryl Dunye ($24.95; First Run).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; You get six provocative, funny shorts -- or "Dunyementaries" -- that led to her breakout film The WatermelonWoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping this means she can get her next project made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO WORK OUT? -- The scarily over-the-top surgeons of Nip/Tuck Season Five Part One ($59.98; Warner Bros.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I do NOT want to go in for surgery with these guys working on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They must to be awfully distracted with the madness that circles around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO PUT ON YOUR SPURS? -- Westerns like the classic TV shows Women's Rights Michelle Obama Europe Newspapers Cars War Wire Video Financial Crisis Barack Obama MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » Books by this author A cabin of one's own: New England's MacDowellColony celebrates 100years of artistic utopia.And the gay and lesbianartists who prosperedthere celebrate ...

You can check out everything from 70s drama Swingtown First Season (optimistic title, that) ($40.99; Paramount) to the 70s comedy Happy Days: The Fourth Season (which looked back to the 50s, of course) ($40.99; Paramount), multiple episodes of the public access cult classic Glenn O'Brien's TV Party ($19.95 each; Brink), the smash-em-up cartoon Transformers Energon: The Ultimate Collection ($59.98; Hasbro), the goofily absurd Aqua Teen Hunger Force 6 ($29.98; Turner), and the mellow country comedy of Petticoat Junction First Season ($40.99; Paramount).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO INVEST IN BRENDAN FRASER STOCK? He's made three movies in his mummy franchise, including The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor ($29.98; Universal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And they've all made about $400 million worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever they're paying our square-jawed hero, he's worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No wonder he's the lead in the new G.I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joe movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BEST REASON TO BUY WALL-E? -- I've always disliked Disney's straight-to-DVD moneymakers like The Little Mermaid 2: Return To The Sea ($29.99; Disney).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They're so cynical and half-baked, it dims the pleasure of the original for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And how Jim Henson's name got on thecheapo Goldilocks and the 3 Bears ($18.99; Weinstein) is beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He'll be rolling over in his grave as soon as he stops throwing up. (Ouch! But it really is way beneath Henson's legacy.) Theyboth make the merely competent Jim Carrey flick Dr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seuss' Horton Hears A Who ($29.98; Fox), but as someone said, Horton is one of the more dignified storybook characters so a manic JimCarrey is not smart casting, however entertaining he might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Happy holidays!
