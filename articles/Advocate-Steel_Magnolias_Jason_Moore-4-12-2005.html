                <p>I 1 That Southern grail of comedy,Steel Magnolias, is back+nd on Broadway- wilh Avenue0's acclaimed out director in charge By Michael Giltz he revirzl of Steel Magmo\i,as at New York's Lyceum Theater promises a welcome contrast to current Broadway dramas like Tweh.te Angry Men. "We're the perfect antidote," quips out director Jason Moore. "We're Sia Happy Wam,en." The play, a 1987 off-Broadway hit now making its Broadway debut, was penned in just 10 days by Louisianaplay- wright Robert Harling after his sister Susan died of complications from dia- betes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It focuses on a group of women who gather in a beauty parlor, the one safe place where they can gripe about- and support each other through-mar- riages, illness, and death. "I'm from Arkansas, and knowing these people and my mom being a single mother, it's what I come from," says Moore, 34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also relates personally to the sense of loss that motivated Harling to write about his sister. "I had abrother who died in a car accident in a very shocking way," says Moore, "so the con-cept of loss is always something I think a lot about." Moore suffered a second loss when his mother died unexpectedly on the first day of rehearsals for Auenue Q, which he directed both off and on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now he likes to remember that the film adaptation of Magnolias was one of his mother's favorites. "In terms of examining loss, [Sfeel Magno- liasl is a really entertaining and hearten- ing way of Iookhg at it," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cast comprises Frances Stern- hagen, Christine Ebersole, Rebecca Gay- heart, Lily Rabe, Marsha Mason, and Delta Burke as beauty-shop owner Truvy (played by Dolly Parton in the movie). "IVe never done much theater," Burke confesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she's clearly hav- ing a wonderful time working with Moore and Harling. "Gay men under- stand me better," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harling has shown his understanding of women in Hollywood hits like The First Wiues CIub and Soandi,sh (whichhe's turning into a musical); he's now working on a big-screen version of Dal- lns and a project for Reese Witherspoon called Sporfs Wid.otn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, says Har- Iing, this revival gives him a chance to spotlight one woman friend in particnlar: "I've known Franny [Sternhagen] for years and years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's always been a dream of mine to write something for FYances, and little did I realize I had!" In the end it's that spirit of friendship that distinguishes Sleel Magno\ias from some of the comedies that came after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AI- though the play is famed for its one-liners ("The only thing that sepaxates us from the animals is our abiliSr to accessorize"), Moore is determined to keep the emo- tions real and not reduce the lives of these women to a wacky sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How's that done, exactly? Moore laughs: "You stay away from garish oranges and pinks and really big hair and shoulder pads."
