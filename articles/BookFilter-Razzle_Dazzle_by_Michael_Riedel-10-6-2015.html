It's aboutbackroom dealings as much as artistry because both are essential for Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of it is fun, like the Tonyshowdown between "Dreamgirls" and "Nine." Keeping it from greatness is a confused, sprawling nature: the jumpingback and forth gets confusing at a few points, certain chapters start to feel like random features plopped in out ofnowhere and a rush to cover literally everything results in a flat-footed rush through some material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's vivid andserious and good enough to make you wish it was great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless, it's substantial and sure to be entertaining andinformative for all but the most ardent theater buffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Let's hope Riedel's next book gets either a tighter focus or takesits time and really sprawls out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If this were an out of town tryout, the critics would say it could become a winner.Opening cold on Broadway, it's one the cognoscenti will enjoy but may not play to tourists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whatever it's commercialfate, Riedel is sure to be back. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“This book is a love letter to Broadway, both a splendid history of this American institution and a wonderful account ofhow art gets made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It made me fall for Broadway’s magic all over again: its history and its myths, its heroes and itsvillains, its up and its downs, its dirt and its dish, its failure and its glory.” - Hugh Jackman“There have only been a handful of books in history that have come close to accurately depicting the energy anddrive that run the business of Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Riedel’s Razzle Dazzle joins that very short list that includesWilliam Goldman’s legendary The Season and Richard Maney’s classic Fanfare—and is every bit the equal of thosebooks that those of us who love Broadway can recite by heart.” - Scott Rudin“Razzle Dazzle is a fantastically fun book, full of high energy, anecdotes, and wit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Riedel lays bare the secrethistory of Broadway in all its grease paint, shady dealings, and shining moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Written with love but also a piercingeye, this is one show no one should miss.”- Amanda Foreman“If you've ever wondered how Times Square got its…</p>
