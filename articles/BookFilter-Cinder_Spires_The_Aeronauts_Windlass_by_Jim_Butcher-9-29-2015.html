They talk and have their own alliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bridget's boon companion is Rowl, who is vastly superior tohumans and has an hilarious perspective on one and all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did I mention the cat-like half-breeds, if I can be so crass indescribing the not-quite respectable warrior-born who are marvelous fighters? Did I mention the frightening silk-weavers, creatures from a nightmare? Did I mention the etherealists, half-batty witches and wizards of a sort who goinsane processing the energy around one and all but can use it to fight and predict and shape the future? Butchersets all of this in motion with energy and verve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The women are thoroughly winning, the men often their equal (albeitusually overwhelmed), the action non-stop and thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's a modest, very modest, false step towards the endwhen Captain Grim keeps interrupting a climactic battle to explain strategy to Gwen just so we can follow what'sgoing on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As if.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That minor quibble aside, this has an assurance and depth of character that marks this novel as oneof the year's best and Butcher's new series as one to be hungrily anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A cat would surely do better, but youcan't expect much more from a human. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beware fellow readers, herein lies adventure that will keep you from food or rest…It is as if JulesVerne, H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rider Haggard, Patrick O’Brien and…well, Jim Butcher all got together and wrote a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steampunk donevery, very right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butcher proves yet again that he is an amazing storyteller.”—#1 New York Times bestselling authorPatricia Briggs “This is Jim Butcher at his best, drawing a fully realized, richly detailed, and downright fun literary world wherefearless aeronauts ride the aether, brilliant wizards struggle with doorknobs, and a thirty-pound feline warrior keeps apet human named Little Mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It’s steampunk meets magic with a dose of sci-fi for seasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buy it and read it.You’ll be glad you did.”—New York Times bestselling author David Weber “So Jim Butcher is writing futuristic dystopian steampunk? You had me at Jim Butcher, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the rest is cooltoo....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Great action scenes, a fascinating world, and characters of a sort I've never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This iseverything I’ve come to expect from Jim Butcher, but in a delightful new flavor.”—#1 New York Times bestsellingauthor Patrick Rothfuss"Butcher…More</p>
