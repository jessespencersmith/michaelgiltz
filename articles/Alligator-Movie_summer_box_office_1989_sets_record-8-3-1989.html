Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - Spielberg's magic touch continues with the third and final installment of the Indiana Jones trilÂ­ ogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has grossed about $170 million in North A merica and will surely repeat that success overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Families came in droves to see the closest thing to a Saturday afternoon serial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While certainly entertaining, Crusade was neiÂ­ ther as breathtakingly ne",: as Raiders nor as scary as The Temple of Doom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lethal Weapon II -The chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover hasJTIad e this sequel one of the few movies to gross more money than the hit that spawned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The original Weapon made about 570 million, but this will pass 5100 million soon -no thanks to the Philadelphia court system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A judge there has ordered jurors for an international money launÂ­ dering trial to avoid the Warner Bros. release because-it deals with the same topic and might prejudice them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Where does such thinking end? Should jurors in a trial involving racism be barred from seeing Do The Right Thing? Is Licence To Kill detrimental to anyone trying to remain impartial in a drug case? Why not simplify the process? Ban from the courtroom anyone who saw and enjoyed The Karate Kid TIl and just assume everyone else is intelligent enough to separate fact from fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Honey, I Shrunk The Kids -Disney returned fo its simple-minded idea of good, clean family fun and made $100 million in the rocess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rick 4, APPtA USE, THURSDAY AUGUST 3 Because of its small budÂ­ get, this hil~rious comedy by Spike lAe shoul. be considered a major success even though it will only gross about 520 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funny, sharp and aggressive , it marks a major step forward for Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the best of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE BOMBS Karate Kid III -Here's a sad story: When Ralph Macchio was offered a starring role in the first Karate Kid, a clause in his contract forced o 1- d it P cd en he ed him to agree to two sequels if Columbia Pictures wished to make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Being an unknown actor, Macchio had to sign on the dotted line or throw away his shot at the big time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep in mind, the originaI J~ 'was a good film that any young actor would have killed to be in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So don't blame him for Kid Ill, which died quickly after a strong opening weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its gross of $30 million is a far cry from the $110 million of Karate Kid II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's hoping ClHumbia paid through the nose to get it made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Trek V: The Final Frontier -It might have passed as a decent episode of the series, but as a major motion picture, fitfully amusing and ends with a worst since the pretentious Star Tr: Picture and will stall at $50 millio is is slow, ud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the : The'Motion Licence To Kill -No Bond m ie will ever lose money -they're a staple in fo ign markets and have a guaranteed base of i erest in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Britain, Licence got off to e strongest start of any Bond flick yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he it will only pull in about $30 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's t,oo bad, because Dalton is doing a good job of toughening up 007's tattered image after the silly, self-mocking tone of View To A Kill, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No more cartoon violence for this anti-hero : when he kills someone in Licence, it's ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pink Cadillac -This Clint Eastwood vehicle died a qUick and painful death at the box office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even Eastwood fans didn't bother t ow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Is this really the same man who starred in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? Great Balls of Fire! -Probably the most significant failure of the summer, Fire was an artistic and commercial bo b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mini-major Orion can ill-afford the bath it took on this movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dennis Quaid remains The-Movie-Star-WhoÂ­ Has-Yet-To-Appear-In-A-Hit.</p>
