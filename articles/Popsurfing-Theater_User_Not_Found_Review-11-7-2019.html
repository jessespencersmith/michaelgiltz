And then it clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry dated Luca(sic) for about nine years and then Luca broke up with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And nowLuca is dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Terry says, first Luca left him and now Luca's left the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry is distraught, as anyone would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clearly Terry hadn't gotten over the break-up yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As if the pain and grief weren't bad enough,Terry discovers a very modern twist to all this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When they were still together, Luca named Terry his digital executor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry now has fullMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK Michael Giltz is a freelance writer based in NYC and can be reached atmgiltz@pipeline.com FAVORITE LINKS Americablog Five O'Clock Lightning baseball blogDeep Pop -- Lori Lakin's Blog The Back Page -- Jason Page on ESPN Radio Cine-Blog -- George Robinson's Blog Documents On Art &amp; Cinema - Daryl Chin's Blog Brucie G's Wondrous Blog Of Adventure and Mystery -- Bruce Greenspan's Blog BLOG ARCHIVE â–¼ 2019 (86) â–¼ November (6) BOOKS: Is Finance The Root Of All Evil?access to all of Luca's social media accounts and must decide what if anything should be preserved and what should be tidily erased from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the five stages of grief, 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Possibilities abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luca blocked Terry from his Facebook account (and presumably Twitter et al), which Terry says he appreciated -- lesspossibility of turning into an online stalker, he confesses cheerily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now Terry can see exactly what Luca has been up to since they separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Did Luca have an online journal? Did he have an account on a gaydating app? Did he have an account on a gay dating app before theybroke up? But none of the voyeuristic possibilities are explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No secrets are revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Terry grieves over his lost love while looking at public Facebook posts and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry also reconnects with Luca's motherMaria who, in one of the show's few subtle touches, mentions in a textshe regrets not asking Terry to speak at the memorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Really, he just mourns and remembers why he loved Luca in the first place and all those digital files help him do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry might just as easily be sortingthrough Luca's closet or cleaning out his desk drawer, clutching abeloved t-shirt or discovering a birthday card Luca tucked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Theresult would be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology adds very little to User Not Found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The piece is a monologue and the information we get via headphones and cell phone(or should I say mobile?) is minimal and mostly unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It begins with some scene-setting music by Norah Jones and background chatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why over headphones? In fact the room is filled with themusic before we put on the headphones so it makes a seamlesstransition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But why transition at all? Most of the time, we're nothearing the inner thoughts of Terry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We're watching him talk out loud and then hearing the audio feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It leaves his performance at anTHEATER: Good Intentions No Substitute For Good Me...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "Richard III," A Schemer Undone By Greed,...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: "Enchanted April" -- The Charming Tale Th...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER: To Delete or Not To Delete, That Is The D...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MOVIES: "American Dharma" Bum Steve Bannon â–º October (21) â–º September (10) â–º August (9) â–º July (7) â–º June (3) â–º May (6) â–º April (10) â–º March (5) â–º February (1) â–º January (8) â–º 2018 (38) â–º 2017 (6) â–º 2016 (2) â–º 2015 (22) â–º 2014 (2) â–º 2013 (5) â–º 2012 (17) â–º 2011 (15) â–º 2010 (10) â–º 2009 (43) â–º 2008 (86) â–º 2007 (781) â–º 2006 (2412) â–º 2005 (5)unnecessary remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further, the texting and other visual information is generally clunky and slow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why does it take Terry so long to text someone to ask whatthe heck they're offering condolences about? And when he does textit's very cumbersome indeed and I can't imagine why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same is true when Terry scrolls through Luca's social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It takes forever and is quite unrevealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry focuses in on one photo of Luca holding a balloon and it was actually more powerful just to listen to him describe it rather than actually look at the darn thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hmm, we can look at a music videofrom one of Luca's favorite artists...or we can watch Terry talk aboutthat annoying pop artist and eventually break down as the song hits him emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And when Terry describes a leopard (or panther? or lion? some cat-like creature, anyway) coming into the cafÃ© andprowling around the other customers it's a lot more interesting toimagine than anything we might see on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, they sweeten themix with the howl of the creature, but Terry already fired ourimagination without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again and again, the bells and whistles of the tech got in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the audience isolated in headphones for much of the show, Iunderstood why they sweetened the mix with some low-key cannedaudience laughter at appropriate moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it was distracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other ideas worked better, like the time Terry was leaving a voice mail message...and kept leaving it on the audio track but in real lifeaddressed us and said his message was even boring himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terrystruggles to remember some moments...and photos of them appearblurry on the screen of the mobiles we're holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fine idea though ithad little dramatic impact for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ditto the many abstract videos meant to convey the emotional turmoil Terry is undergoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little better was the use of that one photo of Luca holding a balloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AsTerry went on about it, the photo became subtly smaller and smalleruntil it seemed to float away into the distance on the phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Again, this was more interesting than impactful but at least it showed them trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The piece was written by Chris Goode and directed by Daphne Attias, who co-founded the company with actor O'Donovan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Terry, he offers an immediate intimacy with the audience, not to mention some wonderful body work as he rolls and crawls and glides around theroom at one key moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But strip away all the toys and themonologue itself is banal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If there were any insights at hand, I was toobusy looking at my cell phone to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worst of all, the show never even starts to grapple with the question it insistently raises: if you could delete your digital legacy when you die(or a loved one's after they're gone), would you? In the show, that'sapparently just a simple yes or no answer and Terry makes a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he barely scratches the surface of how he makes his decision orwhy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Isn't there some curating to be done? If every image of a loved one is stored online on their Facebook or Twitter account, would you want tojust delete them all? How about choosing the best? How about askingthe man's mother if she'd like some or all of those photos to be placedin an online album she can access? Or printing the best in a book you give her? Are there images of your former lover and his new boyfriend? Do you save those? Do you reach out to the lover? If you'rethe only person with control over all these potential memories, isn't itimportant to think about everyone else? And what does it mean to save a static Facebook page? Do you really just want it sitting there? If the person who died only had four Twitter posts ( like Terry does), whythen it's not much of a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since Luca had tens ofthousands of Twitter posts, you've got some thinking to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Are they just boring images of the meal he's eating? Or is there a thread, a celebration of the life he led or the causes he championed or thefriends he had that are reflected by those posts? Then you get to thedating apps (be they Grindr or OKCupid) and a whole other host ofethical questions arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And hey, does the loved one who just died haveonline friends you knew nothing about? How much of our life are we leading online? Is it meaningless or does it have substance and import and matter? As you can see from above, overseeing the social accounts of some who died raises a host of practical and philosophical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In dealing with them, we should learn more about Luca while Terrywould perhaps reveal more about himself, what Luca means to himand how Terry views this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, Terry makes his choice andthat's it, beyond a quick aphorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What does this decision mean tohim? We don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And the bells and whistles of technology can't distract us from realizing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THEATER OF 2019 Frankenstein: Under The Radar Fest at the Public ** 1/2 Minor Character: Under The Radar Festival at the Public *** Ink: Under The Radar Festival at the Public ** 1/2 Choir Boy ** 1/2 White Noise ** 1/2 Kiss Me, Kate *** Ain't No Mo' *** 1/2 Ain't Too Proud ** The Cradle Will Rock * 1/2 Mrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murray's Menagerie *** 1/2 Oklahoma!
