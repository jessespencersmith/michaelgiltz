                <p>h Gay strings Master puppeteer Ronnie Burkett tells how he brought his wild cast of gay characters to life amid a turbulent year of his own By Michael Gillz Canadian artist Ronnie Burkett is trying to an­ swer that age­ old question: Was he born a pup­ peteer, or was it because of the environment he grew up in? "It certainly wasn't the way I was raised," he says, laugh­ ing. "I would be a doctor or a lawyer, some white­ collar guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I opened the World Book Encyclope­ dia when I was 7, it fell open to puppets, and I said, 'That's what I'll do.' It really was that easy." Now 43, Burkett is in New York, chatting be­ fore an evening perfor­ mance of Street oj Blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Playing at the New York Theatre Workshop , it's a featured show in the prestigious Henson In­ ternational Festival of Puppet Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Street oj Blood tells the sweet and some­ times campy story of Esme, an aging Holly­ wood star-turned-vam­ pire; Eden, a gay terror­ ist who blows up bars to rile his community; and Edna, Eden's mom and a self-proclaimed "silly old biddy in a Sears housedress." The New York Times said Burkett's technical skills in bringing to life 14 characters-includ­ ing the Turnip Comers Ladies Orches­ trale, Ute Haagen-Dazs and Jesus-So long, Punch and Judy Burkett believes he's the first to include gay characters in a text-based puppet show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A prime example: Eden Urbane, who's not just gay but also a terrorist THE ADVOCATE I'" I OCTOBER 24, 2000 simply "astonishes. " The show feels so personal that-despite its fantastic elements­ audiences assume it's very autobiographical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Burkett is happy to leave the question of what's real and what isn't to their imagina­ tion, but as he does make clear, "I will say that I've never been beaten bloody by my fa­ ther while ·wearing a wedding dress." You could call Street oj Blood Burkett's "current" show, but he always has so many works scheduled for performance around the world that this seems misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Str'eet oj Blood, for example, is part of a trilogy that includes Tinka's New Dress and Happy (with Happy scheduled to play throughout Canada from November to April and in London next summer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in prepa­ ration are a European performance of the trilogy; a new work tentatively titled The Madonna oj Nutter Gulch; and a one-man show without puppets called The Likes oj Me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of these shows have in common gay characters, something Burkett thinks was new when he first intro­ duced some in 1986, the year he ~ TRUOIE lEE(2) Young Eden (above, right) gets into wedding-dress drag; Mrs, Edna Rural (left), Eden's mother, with her dog, Dolly founded his own company. "To be honest with you, I'd never seen any­ one put a character who was gay in a text-based puppet show," says Bur­ kett. ''I'm not saying it hasn't been done, but I never saw it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chances are, it wasn't done." He pauses, thinking. "It just seemed natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They don't al­ ways have to be happy characters or successful characters because I do know that there's a prettY emotional ly stable big homo [pulling the strings] right above them." His self-confidence is hard-won: Burkett was born and raised in the Canadian province of Alberta, in a town of 25,000 where people who were different paid a price. "I was told I was a fag before I even knew what that was about," says Burkett. "It started early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was a dirty thing people were hostile about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then you figure out what it is and that you actu­ ally are that, and it just becomes harder. [But] puppetry really helped me because I knew I was getting out." Burkett's also getting out of Al­ berta: he's moving from Calgary to Toronto. "A ten-year relationship has just dissolved this year, and a new one has begun, hence the move," explains Burkett. "It's been a hell of a year." • Giltz is a regular contributor to several periodicals, including the New York Post and Entertairunent Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ja:!
