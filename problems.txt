CURRENT PROBLEMS

My PDFs are too large in size, even after I compress them as much as possible. Also, PDFs of very long articles (say, 50 pages or more) are difficult to process. They are too big in size and the image of the article users click on to read becomes so narrow in width you can barely manage to double click on the icon to open it up. 

I am not computer savvy. I need an easy way to update the information on the site. I need an easy way to create PDFs that will work on the site effectively.
