DESCRIPTION

I have a personal website containing an archive of my published articles, personal blog posts, a résumè and other items. The website promotes me as a writer, podcaster, critic, reporter and a resource for anyone looking for an expert to interview on the entertainment business, the arts, politics and LGBTQI+ issues. It should be professional but fun.
