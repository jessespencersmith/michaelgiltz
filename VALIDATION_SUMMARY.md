## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **4,213 PDFs** properly organized in scans directory
- **4,213 Article HTML pages** created and uploaded
- **42 Publication pages** all using article links (0 PDF links)
- **8,463 total article links** across all publication pages
- **Admin panel** correctly configured with new update system
- **Live site** fully functional at https://www.michaelgiltz.com

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Non-Critical)
- **31 PDFs with naming issues** - These still work but have formatting problems:
  - Double .pdf extensions (e.g., `Lists-Music_Various_Artist_Compilations-5-24-2015.pdf.pdf`)
  - Extra spaces in filenames
  - Duplicate dates in filename
- **18 articles need regeneration** - These PDFs with naming issues need their HTML pages recreated

## üîß Maintenance Going Forward

### Adding New Articles
1. Save articles as PDFs following naming convention: `Publication-Title_With_Underscores-MM-DD-YYYY.pdf`
2. Compress PDFs using the documented workflow
3. Upload PDFs to the scans directory
4. Use the admin panel at https://www.michaelgiltz.com/admin/ to process them
5. The system will automatically create combined pages and update all links

### If Links Go Missing Again
The issue was caused by using the old update system. This has been fixed:
- Old `UpdateArticles.py` has been disabled
- Admin panel now uses `process_new_pdfs.py`
- Links will no longer be corrupted during updates

## üìù Documentation Created
- `README.md` - Complete workflow instructions
- `SETUP_MICHAELS_COMPUTER.md` - Installation guide for Michael's Mac
- `upload_status.txt` - Track batch uploads
- `validation_report.txt` - Detailed validation results

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)
1. Fix the 31 PDFs with naming issues (rename them properly)
2. Run `python3 scripts/create_combined_pages.py` to regenerate their HTML pages
3. Upload the fixed articles

The website is fully functional and ready for continued use!
