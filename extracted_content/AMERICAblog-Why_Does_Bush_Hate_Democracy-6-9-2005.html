6/09/2005 01:40:00 PMGeorge Bush has a pattern of coddling corrupt monarchies andmilitary dictatorships like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Then heturns around and punishes democracies that don't do exactlywhat he wants every single time. The latest example:Germany.A number of nations believe the Security Council should beexpanded from 15 to 25, with four new permanent members.Others think there should also be room for two Africancountries, including possibly Egypt. Does Bush object toincluding Egypt, a corrupt dictatorship that has strangled thatnation's growth and encouraged the growth of extremism inthe Middle East? Nope. He saves his firepower for Germany.Germany has banded together with India, Japan and Brasil tojointly push for a seat on the Security Council. They promisenot to even ask for the right to a veto for 15 years. Since Bushalways insists that democracy is the key to a safe and stablefuture, you'd think he would jump at the chance to give thesefour stable democracies more influence and prestige. But no.Germany objected to Bush invading Iraq and its leader evencampaigned on anti-US sentiment. So Bush is blockingGermany's bid and damn the consequences of internationalsecurity. Germany didn't play ball so they must be punished.More proof? Bush is coddling the cruel government ofUzbekistan even as it opens fire on its own citizens. Sixsenators are suggesting to Bush, gee, do we really want to getinto bed with such a sleazy government? It certainly proves thelie that Bush wants to spread democracy. Really? By garneringa long-term deal for a military base in a corrupt country thatabuses human rights on a grand scale?More proof Bush hates democracy? He's stunned that the OAS(the Organization of American States) laughed off Bush'ssuggestion that he "monitor" the growth of democracy in theAmericas. Gee, maybe it has something to do with the fact thatBush supported a military coup in Venezuela because he didn'tget along with the democratically elected leader.Why does Bush hate democracy?
