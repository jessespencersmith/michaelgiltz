A lot of hard choices today. I didn't go to the only
screening of The Road  (based on the Cormac
McCarthy novel) because it's already played atother festivals and I know I can see it when itopens commercially in November. I also missedboth the Francois Ozon and a well-reviewed
French film to see Dorian Gray  (big mistake,
that one.) And everything else slipped awaythanks to podcasting duties until I managed to
slip into a Czech film I knew nothing about at the
end of the day. Audiences still dutifully applaud volunteers after a trailer encourages them to do so(only in Canada!) and the best part of wandering around the neighborhood is the Beatles music
flowing out of all the record stores nearby.
WAKING SLEEPING BEAUTY  *** out of **** -- A fascinating look at the resurgence of Disney
animation in the 80s (after decades of slumber), the many factors that made it happen and how
success can breed resentment as everyone angles for credit. I pinpointed the turnaround beginningwith The Great Mouse Detective  in 1986 and was pleased to see this film agreed as well. But I
never realized the many factors that came together to get to that string of critical and popular hitsthat included Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin  and
The Lion King  that put Disney back on top. Of course, Michael Eisner and Frank Wells rejuvenated
the studio as a whole, thanks to the imprimatur of Roy Disney. They brought in Jeffrey Katzenberg,
who became passionate about animation and wasn't afraid to trash months or years of work if a
project wasn't gelling and start all over again. Roger Rabbit  brought in a wave of European talent.
The Rescuers Down Under  kick-started computers as a tool for animation. Getting kicked off
campus to a new miserable location for the animators meant an open-air cubicle setup thatinadvertently sparked more collaboration and teamwork. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman cameinto the fold as two of the most gifted musical theater composers of their generation -- and two of
the most broadly appealing since Rodgers & Hammerstein. (That should be at the top of any list.)
That list goes on and this film -- which is 86 minutes long and might be even better as a two-parteron PBS or some such venue at twice the length -- covers it all pretty fairly. My friend was
astonished by the bitterness of some at Katzenberg but failure could never equal success for

<p>generating finger-pointing and backbiting. And I'm still waiting to find out why they never greenlit
a sequel to Roger Rabbit,  which always seemed a no-brainer to me.
DORIAN GRAY  no stars out of **** -- I've always been puzzled and intrigued as to how some bad
movies almost instantly feel artificial. I mean, the movie begins and a cop goes to work, for
example, but somewhere in the back of your mind you can't stop thinking, 'That's not a cop; that's
just an actor in a costume!' Not all bad movies are like this (heck, most bad movies aren't like this)
and avoiding it doesn't mean you're a good movie. It's just a certain level of artificiality, a certainsense of inauthenticity that stamps some movies immediately and forever. The second DorianGray  begins, I had that uneasy feeling: those are costumes, not clothes; that's a set, not London
and so on. I knew I was in for a long 107 minutes. Indeed, when young Dorian Gray arrives in
London (played by handsome Ben Barnes, who has unfortunately been in Stardust, The Chronicles
Of Narnia: Prince Caspian  and this) his absurdly innocent demeanor -- rube alert! -- is so extreme
he just stares in puzzlement when a street urchin reaches into his pocket and takes coins without so
much as a "hey!" at the little thief. Any film this false right away is in trouble and this one surely is.
Based on the Oscar Wilde novel (which I remember being nonplussed by as a boy), it follows Gray
the innocent as he becomes corrupted by the pleasure-seeking Colin Firth, yearned after by painter
Ben Chaplin, loved by a no-name actress and soon becomes such a cold hedonist he outdoes hismentor in caddishness. All while remaining forever young thanks to a mysterious portrait he keepslocked in an attic -- handy that. Few things are quite as depressing as deviance when it's dull -- not
only are you bored, but you can't even think about sinning after the movie is over, it seems so
tiresome. The novel is often read as a coded tale of homosexuality but there's nothing modern orinteresting about this take -- Gray may kiss one or two men but it's only because he's running outof possibilities. And director Oliver Parker's depiction of the painting is especially unwise: it
groans, it shakes and we even get numerous shots seen from the painting's own point of view  (a
grainy image that leads one to suspect the painting is concealing a CCTV camera). Oh dear.
I feel bad about trashing Dorian Gray.  I'm sure everyone had the best intentions and the fine cast
(including Firth, Chaplin, Rebecca Hall and Fiona Shaw) surely didn't choose to spend their time
on a bad film. I rarely take cheap shots and hopefully my tone is seen as properly directed at the
film itself and not the people who made it, as such. Which brings up the question of politeness. Ireferred to a review of A Serious Man as "polite" and someone wondered what I meant and whyany reviewer would feel the need to be polite. I use it to capture the tone of a review that
recognizes a movie had noble intentions and was made with care and craft but for whatever reason
falls short. It would be unfair to be dismissive or snide, people evidently took care...it just isn't
good in some fundamental way. Hence, a polite review. My review of Dorian Gray isn't that polite
because the film fell so terribly short, not because the people who made it offended me with theirfailure. Or the experience is so uncomfortable or exhausting you can't help but reflect yourfrustration in some way for fear of being too polite and misleading audiences into thinking a movie
has some merit. What follows is a polite review of The Trotsky.
THE TROTSKY  ** out of **** -- Our hero Leon Bronstein (a good Jay Baruchel) is convinced
he's the reincarnation of Communist icon Leon Trotsky. (This is a comedy and being a high school
revolutionary who is the reincarnation of Trotsky is funny -- Stalin, Lenin, Pol Pot, not so funny.But just the name "Trotsky" holds promise.) No good reason is ever given for this. His father SaulRubinek doesn't pay attention to him but that doesn't quite cut it -- dad seems fine except when he
has to deal with his 17 year-old son organizing a hunger strike at the factory Rubinek owns. And
the many "coincidences" between our Leon and Russia's Leon don't work either -- they're eitherforced into being by Leon (who, for example tracks down a guy with the same name as Lenin and
later gets himself arrested) or just too banal. Does any of this matter? Yes, actually. In Rushmore
(another film about an eccentric high schooler), our hero had all sorts of odd tics about him. Butthey were presented so matter-of-factly or so convincingly that we bought him whole hog. Leon, we
don't. And so the movie never rises above its very high concept, never goes from concept to
character. Leon wants to unionize the kids at his new public school. No particular reason, really, hejust wants to storm the barricades and any barricades will do. Only the mildest of tyrannies sets
this up (a hall monitor who gives detentions for untucked shirts and muddy shoes). That's it. That's
the beginning and the end of the outrages, other than the fact that administrators ignore Leon,which suits him fine since he doesn't really want changes in the system, he wants to lead a
revolution. But agitation without purpose is pointless. Stalking a girl who is nine years older than
he and named Alexandria (just like Trotsky's first wife!) isn't fun either, especially when she ratherunconvincingly humors this nut. Imagine if Leon had started as a revolutionary but learned to careabout actual issues as the film progressed. That would have made a real story. Instead, the most
impassioned speech comes from a fellow student when Leon isn't even around. And the movie has
kept the other kids at such arm's length I didn't even realize the guy was supposed to be gay until

Chairmanthe finale. The movie cares about the other characters as little as Leon. And if he knows them so
little, how can we know him? Or care to even try? Director Jacob Tierney made the well-cast gay
spin on Oliver Twist  (called simply Twist ) and this movie has enough spark (joke intended, Trotsky
fans) to make me keep an eye on Tierney. I just wish I had felt more driven to keep an eye on Leon.Still, I did enjoy the Ayn Rand jibe. Audience note: the film got some of the strongest applause so
far, though Toronto is clearly not a cheer or boo sort of festival a la Cannes, so this may be nothing
more than support for a Canadian movie by the locals.
After The Trotsky,  I decided to mount a revolution...actually, I spent a few hours doing my weekly
podcast for Showbiz Sandbox. That meant my last chance to see a film was down to Shameless , a
Czech film by the director of the pretty good Divided We Fall,  so in I dived.
SHAMELESS  ** 1/2 or maybe *** out of **** -- Unlike last night's shot in the dark, this quiet
little drama had a shaggy charm. Our hero (of sorts) is a shameless fellow. Out of nowhere, he
finds his wife's nose disturbingly large, something he can't fail to mention. Then we realize he's
been shagging the young au pair (why anyone who's ever seen a movie with an au pair would allow
one in their house is a mystery to me -- they are trouble!). The wife kicks him out and he loses hisjob as a weatherman. She falls for a new man, while getting along great with her in-laws, who seem
to like her more than their ne'er do well son. He has the au pair, but falls for a famous singer old
enough to be his mother. It's all quite ramshackle and meandering, happy to take its time getting
somewhere and not too concerned to make that somewhere important or momentous. Enjoyable.
Tomorrow is just a train wreck of competing film screenings. I interview Vera Farmiga at 10:20 for
the excellent Up In The Air. But then what? Michael Moore's Capitalism  or the very well-reviewed
L'Affaire Farewell?  I was leaning towards L'Affaire , but that would make it impossible to see the
Michael Caine vehicle Harry Brown.  But if I see that I can't see Lebanon , which just won the top
prize at Venice. And they both conflict with the fun-looking Bitch Slap,  a Midnight Madness movie
(one of the best curated events at the festival) and involving creative talent that worked on Xena .
Sigh. At least I know nothing will get in the way of the Frederick Wiseman documentary about theParis Opera Ballet at 8 p.m.
NOTE TO SELF: NEVER FILE WHEN YOU'RE EXHAUSTED. I inadvertently confused the title of
two movies: Drew Barrymore's Whip It,  about the world of roller derby and Bitch Slap,  a fun-
looking movie I mentioned above directed by Rich Jacobson, both of which I hope to see. Myapologies for the mistake.
