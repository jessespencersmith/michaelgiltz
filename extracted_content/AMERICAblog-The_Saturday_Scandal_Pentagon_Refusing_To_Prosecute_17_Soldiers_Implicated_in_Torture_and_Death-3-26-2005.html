3/26/2005 12:02:00 PMAh, Saturday! A day for relaxation, gardening, going to Ikeawith your partner...and burying scandals you're embarrassedabout during a slow news cycle.This week's Saturday Scandal?The Pentagon is ignoring the recommendations of investigatorsand refusing to prosecute 17 soldiers involved in the deaths ofthree prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's reason? One caseseemed fine by them, another one they decided didn't haveenough evidence and the third...oh, never mind.Obviously, Bush is very focused on these torture cases. Wantproof? The men in charge of Iraq and Afghanistan at the timegot Medals of Honor. The man who helped craft his "torture iscool as long as they don't die" directive is the new AttorneyGeneral. And now apparently, even killing them is okaybecause even if Army investigators say the cases should beprosecuted they'll be let off scott free.
