 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyMovie Review: Rainn Wilson's Kind
of Super
SUPER  2 1/2 out of 4
In Theaters Now
This comedy was definitely one of the success stories of
the Toronto International Film Festival. A similar tale toKick-Ass  (which I really enjoyed), it shows a schmucky,
average Joe (Rainn Wilson) who turns himself into asuperhero when his wife (Liv Tyler) leaves him for adrug-dealing thug (Kevin Bacon) that uses her as aguinea pig for his heroin. Wilson dons a cape, chooses aweapon (a hefty wrench) and coins a catchphrase that isincreasingly funny as the film goes on: "Shut up, crime!"

Quickly Released
From Jail After...Comic bookstore geek Ellen Page becomes his VERY enthusiastic sidekick, and the tone veers wildly as
Wilson goes from meek to freak, beating up thugs but also mauling a guy for cutting in line at the cinema.(Actually, the guy was meeting a friend, I think, so it doesn't even count as really cutting in the firstplace.)
The movie is a little unsure of itself tonally because it doesn't quite know what it thinks of its protagonist.
But it is weirdly amusing and has cult favorite written all over it for a certain demographic. More
negatively, Wilson (quite funny on The Office ) just isn't up to the dramatic demands. A scene where he
curses God for making him such an unattractive loser should be piercing but just isn't. I'm sure thisproject was in the works long before Kick-Ass  came to life and they must hate being compared
unfavorably to it. But sometimes even superheroes can't catch a break.
