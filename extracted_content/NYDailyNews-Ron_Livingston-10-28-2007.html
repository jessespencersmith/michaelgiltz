            <p>The actor returns to New York
with two new films BYMrcHAELcrr,rz
ex and tlie City" may be
frlming in NewYork, but Ron
Livingston isn't promoting
the retum of his character,
average-guy witer Jack Berg-
er, the guy who briefly won
the heart of Carrie (Sarah
Jcssica Parker) during rhe show's run -
atrd helped to tum the catchptx'ase "He's
just not that into you" into a pop-culture
touchstone (lots of fans still think Car-
rie should have wound up with Berger md
not Chris Noth's Mr, Big )
Nope, Livingston is cal.ling from L A ,
where he's fllmirrg "The Time Traveler's
wife" with Eric Bana and Rachel McAd-
ams (a sort of "Somewhere in Time" for
our time, based on the best-selling nov-
el) And he's promoting two new labors
of love: "Holly," opening Friday, is an un-
blinking look at prostitution and sex traf-
fickrng in Cambodia, and "Music Within,"
just out, is the true story of a real-life ad-
vocate for the physically challenged who
didn't oyercome his own Vietnm-war re-
lated deafness so much as ignore it.
As for Livingston, he can't ignore the
fact that he recently tumed 40
"An actor's career doesn't feel likejust
one cileer to me," says Iivingston, who
wm raised in Iowa by his Lutherm minister
mom and engineer dad
"It feels like about five or six Becase ev-
ery six or seven years, you look in the minor
md you have a completely different prod-
uct All of a sudden, 'Oh, I guess I'm in this
business now. last I remembered, I was in
the dashing yomg mm business ' It always
feels like you're at the begiming of some ca-
reer you don't undeNtand "
Luckily for Livingston, he's been trad-
ing on an everlman appeal his entire ca-
reer to great effect, and tuming the big
4-oh won't change that He's still boyish
enough to play the lead in "Music Within"
at both 20 and in his alOs (thanks to a very
adaptable haircut). And clearly under-
stands something about acting
His first big break came in "Swingers,"
a role in the 1996 film that launched
Vince Vaughn and Jon Faweau
which might have doomed a
lesser talent to a lifetime of
people saying 'You're so
money" to him. Wouldn't
it be depressing if people
always associated you with
one role?
"IJ it was something I liked,
I'll take one over none," laughs
Livingston, who is single md
doesn't mind the off and on nature ofthe
business, because he says he enjoys being
lzy as much as working
Fortunately, he didn't have to find out
what it was like to be associated with just
one movie: 1999's "Oftice Space" is a cult
comedy of such enduring popularity that
Livingston's Buddha-like approach to
getting ahead in business without real-
ly trying can be quoted at length by offrce"
drones all over the country.And before that role could tJT)ecast him
foreve4, he had his stint on "Sex and the
City," not to mention a string of acclaimed
roles in other projects, most notably his
tum as an alcoholic in the Tom Hanks/
Steven Spielberg World War II miniseries
"Band of Brothers," one of the most popu-
lil HBO programs eYer
. Throw in the prematurely canceled sit-
com "Towies" (with MoUy Ringrilald and
then-unknoms Jenna Elfman and Lauren
Graham), his flashy tum as lawyer Alan
Lowe in a multi-episode arc on "The Prac-
tice," an Off Broadway stint in Neil LaB-
ute's "In a Dark Dark House," and two
separate weaselly executives in "The Cool-
er" and "Adaptation," and clearly, Liyings-
ton hasn't had much chance to laze about
He hopes his two new films will actively
get audiences into theaters "Music with-
in' depicts the life of Richud Pimentel.
who was the primary force behind the pas-
sage of the Americans With Disabilities
Act, a civil-rights landmark that opened
the door (md built the ramps) for people
living with physical handicaps
And "Holly" shows the Menclr-
ingly diffidt problem of sex traf-
frcking md child prostitution,
via the story of a washed-up
guy in Cambodia who be-
comes obsessed with trying
to rescue a 14-year-old girl
trapped in abrothel (Itwas
filmed on Iocation in dan-
gerous areas often controlled
by criminals ) Neither fllm
sw pulls its punches, but Livingston
can see a sliver of light at the end of
"HolJy'' despite its lack of heartwamirg
TV-movie-style resolution.
"A guy who was looking for a chance to
redeem himself, redeemed himself," says
Livingston "And a girl who had no choic-
es finally had some choices- We wanted
the audience to feel that the story is not
done yet, and it's time for the audience to
get involved if they want the story to have
a happy ending " tN
