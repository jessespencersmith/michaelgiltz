ANN'S WAREHOUSEIt's a cruel irony that every piece of technology we create to capture the world around us usually kills off someearlier technology, trapping whatever work it contains in an outdated format that becomes all but lost to us. Inturn, that new format is superseded by something else and everything it contains becomes trapped in anoutdated format and essentially lost forever, like a museum no one will ever enter again, dusty and forgotten.Look at music. Wax cylinders and 78s were a miracle that allowed more people to hear and enjoy great artiststhan ever before in history. At the same time, it (and piano rolls and other devices before it) killed off a traditionof communal singing and folk songs that had been handed down for thousands of years. No one knows howmany were lost in time. But at least the great performers of the age were captured and preserved on 78s! Butthe 78 was displaced by the LP and the vast majority of music captured on 78s has been all but forgotten. TheLP was shouldered aside somewhat by the cassette and 8-track with all three of them crushed by the compactdisc. Most of the music captured on LP never made it to CD. And now CDs have been supplanted by the MP3format and digital music in general. And yes, most of the music on compact disc never made the transition.A curious other shift happened. Almost every step of the way, the ability to record music increased. From the 78to the LP to the cassette to digital music, recording got cheaper and easier. So as format displaced format, themountain of actual recorded music increased exponentially as well, with more and more of it slipping through ourfingers at every stage. People used to need a lot of cash and the ability to book a recording studio; now they cancreate world class recordings in their living room and send it out over the internet in a few easy steps. The moremusic we create, the more we lose.It's true in a lot of other areas: most silent movies have been lost forever. Most TV shows never made it ontoVHS or DVD. Now as more and more and more TV shows are created for hundreds of channels in the US (andmultiply that all over the world) how many of them will be preserved and archived for future generations?Literally anyone can publish a book and post it online for the world to see. But who can keep track of it all, muchless read it?To give one small example, according to the new book The Millionaire and the Bard by Andrea Mays,industrialist Henry Folger was a passionate, compulsive collector of all things Shakespeare, especially FirstFolios but far more than that: period instruments, pamphlets, scholarly works, reference books Shakespearemight have used and literally half a million "playbills" for shows of the time. He built a library in DC to house it allfor scholars to dive into. It officially opened in 1932. That was more than 80 years ago and they haven't evenfinished cataloguing everything he collected.So here we have Early Shaker Spirituals. It's a strange, defiant, quixotic, fruitless and all-the-more-admirable-</p>

One show was based on an album of Hawaiian hulas, another somehow linked to LSD. Thisparticular album was released in 1976 on the Rounder Records label and any serious music buff will recognizethat as a smart, independent outfit with great and varied tastes. Release number 0078 from that company, EarlyShaker Spirituals was recorded sporadically over 13 years by the United Society of Shakers, Sabbathday Lake.Onstage, a group of five women in various configurations sit or stand, literally singing along to side one of theoriginal LP as it plays in their ears via wireless headphones. A handsome narrator (Jamie Poskin) bounces upbetween most songs to introduce a tune or two and read some of the brief explanatory notes from the LP linernotes. They sing it, pause, wait for more brief comment if any and then move on to the next. Another manstands on the side by a turntable, lifting and lowering the needle back onto the grooves of the actual LP as closeas possible to where they left off. If the needle returns to the last snatch of the previous song, the women singquietly along with the fade out and then wait for the new song to begin in their ears before starting again. Mostly,we hear just their singing though sometimes the original recording is introduced softly into the mix as well.Towards the end, they are joined by four men who dance along with them. It lasts one hour and is, appropriatelyenough, seemingly simple and straightforward in every way. I'm not sure Shakers would take a bow, but otherthan this forgivable theatrical tradition, it's purely in the spirit of that strangely memorable religious sect.It's amusing to see New Yorkers who might not have been to any house of worship for a long time quietly andrespectfully listening to performances of old Shaker spirituals. But this is not a recreation. It is a reinterpretation;pay attention and you'll see. The costumes by Enver Chakartash with Naomi Raddatz are sober andstraightforward for the women, true. But there's a dash of modernity for the men, especially the modern shirtprint sported by Matthew Brown (like the other men, he was sitting in the audience and surprised me when hejumped up and began taking part). The set by Elizabeth LeCompte & Jim Clayburgh is also modest, but moresuggestive than authentic, with half a wall and half a window and a few pieces of furniture hinting at their worldeasily enough. Kate Valk directs invisibly, with dances drawn from obvious sources like pamphlets on traditionalShaker dances and first-hand accounts, but also from temple marches found in a documentary about Malcolm Xand varied music videos on YouTube (which isn't as un-Shaker like as you'd think; they always embracedtechnology).The layers of remembering are thick and suggestive here. First there is the remembering of the original LP, aheroic attempt to nail down just a handful of the thousands upon thousands of Shaker spirituals that poured outof this community over the years via "gifts" from spiritual presences like The Little Shepherdess and LaughingJack (I think that was his name), musical guides channeled by members. Many of the songs were captured onpaper by the sect in their heyday of the mid-1800s. Dubbed the Era Of Manifestations, it's when the Shakersgrew to some 6000 strong and the songs they created grew even greater in number. Yes, there were probablymore Shaker spirituals than there were Shakers.Frances McDormand has a lovely monologue (taken from the LP, I assume), in which a Shaker womandiscusses her fascination with the songs she heard and becoming determined to learn as many of them aspossible. Even here, the show is subtle, with McDormand beginning her story speaking over the voice of theoriginal Shaker on the abum, a woman we can hear for a while from the original recording, until it fades awayand only McDormand is heard in her place. Later, the wonderful Suzzy Roche delivers a poignant tale of an oldwoman's remembrance about being a child and hearing a 90 year old Shaker woman sing and begging her tosing some more. (I won't spoil this poignant story by revealing any more.)Most of the songs are easily grasped, some with amusing references to liquor and most everyone will know theirgreatest hit, "Simple Gifts" aka "Tis the gift to be simple," a melody seized upon by countless other faiths andpopularized forever by composer Aaron Copland. The evening is not moving in a theatrical sense, but it moves.Personality peeks out, as when LeCompte very subtly moved her feet in time at various moments, a show-offy</p>

It might be welcome:as of 2013, only three Shakers remained at Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in Maine, their last remainingcommunity.So Shakers strove to learn these songs. Rounder Records strove to preserve at least a few dozen of them. Andnow the Wooster Group resurrects that LP, one of thousands upon thousands lying alone and unplayed in atticsand garages around the world. And even in the performance they reclaim the act of sitting and listening to anLP, the communal experience that existed when people would sit around a turntable and read the liner notesand stare at the album art and just listen to an album, as a group. With digital music and headphones holdingsway, the idea of an album as a group experience seems archaic. But here they are, raising and lowering theneedle, listening to a song, singing along, sharing the liner notes and then raising and lowering the needleagain. It was quaint. It was sweet. When can we do it again?AIRLINE HIGHWAY * 1/2 out of **** MANHATTAN THEATRE CLUB AT SAMUEL J. FRIEDMAN THEATREEvery character is aggressively colorful in Lisa D'Amour's new comic drama Airline Highway. Set in NewOrleans, it's like very bad Tennessee Williams, with each new person spouting cold truths, snappy rejoindersand hard-won pearls of wisdom until you long for someone to just show up and not have a backstory or somepain bursting to get out. No such luck.The excuse for all this noise is the funeral of the very much alive Miss Ruby, or should I say the barely aliveMiss Ruby (Judith Roberts). She's the colorful (of course) and beloved matriarch of The Humming Bird Motel, arundown place off Airline Highway and across the street from a soon to be built CostCo. Miss Ruby once ran astrip club (again, of course) and this faded impresario has gathered around her "duckies," the lost and woundedsouls that strip clubs and rundown fleabag motels attract.You've got the hooker with a heart of gold and a taste for hard drugs (Julie White as Tanya); the drag queenwho has seen it all, baby (K. Todd Freeman as Sissy Na Na and I couldn't make that up); a street poet with nota dime to his name (Ken Marks as Francis and boy can I relate!) and prodigal son Bait Boy (Joe Tippett), backfor the afternoon after making good in the fabled suburbs of Atlanta, which might as well be Shangri La it seemsso far away from these down and outers. It's all as cliched and dire as the descriptions of those characterssound.True, Miss Ruby is not exactly dead yet, but in a moment of lucidity Ruby says she wants to have a funeral soeveryone can say nice things about her while she's still around. Bait Boy's return stirs things up. He left behindthe homeless stripper Krista (Caroline Neff), who can't even afford a room at the Humming Bird Motel anymore,which makes her truly lost. She ignores the attentions of the handyman Tim Edward Rhoze, a nice guy who likesher and would provide a stable environment relatively speaking and thus is of no interest to the self-destructiveKrista, who doesn't really think she's worthy of love anyway. Bait Boy was the one, she believes, wrongly andyou know Krista and he will exchange words if not bodiy fluids. He brings along his new wife's 16 year olddaughter Zoe (Carolyn Braver) and she immediately starts interviewing everyone for a class project in as forceda case of exposition as I've seen in a while.This is dire stuff, with that kid Zoe yelled at every five minutes by this and that person and then bizarrely sayingshe wants to move in. (She'd last about five minutes.) The funeral kicks into high gear, revelations are made,Bait Boy is built up and torn down and then Miss Ruby is trotted out to give her benediction. You can see it all amile away, which only makes the predictable twists and turns of D'Amour's work more exhausting. Her Detroitwas a flawed but interesting play that became a Pulitzer finalist. This is a long way down from that.Director Joe Mantello has had a rough season, with the musical The Last Ship bedeviled by a weak book andnow this. He does what he can -- namely an effective act two opener mid-party that mildly brings the show to life</p>

The scenic design by Scott Pask is the show's strongestelement. It's a realistic and effective set, capturing the main strip of rooms, the manager's office, a usefulstairway for variety as characters talk to each other. The set is ably supported by the lighting of JaphyWeideman and especially the music and sound design of Fitz Patton, who subtly places this motel in the contextof a wider world without calling attention to itself. The costumes of David Zinn are a little over the top, but that'sunquestionably what the material called for.Clumsily, a gun is introduced in act one, namely the repeated suggestion that Bait Boy likes his girls underage.However, it never goes off since teenage Zoe convincingly describes him as behaving appropriately with her.Indeed he's (sort of) shacked up with an older woman now and Krista was apparently of age when they datedfor six long years, so why did the play hint darkly about it anyway?Under the circumstances, you simply feel for the actors asked to embody such cliches and applaud those whomanage here and there to carve out a little humanity. Marks is good as the poet, perhaps in part because he'sunburdened with any elaborate revelations. Tippett is appealing as Bait Boy and captures his quick descent intoold habits effectively, though he can't make sense of the bizarre behavior the character indulges in towards theend. Roberts and Freeman are both saddled with nonsense in their monologue and snappy comments,respectively. What could they do except deliver it with gusto? And Julie White surely yearned for a meatydramatic role after years of being so good in so many comedies. She surely deserves much better than this.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2 Parade in Concert at Lincoln Center ** 1/2 Hamilton at the Public *** The World Of Extreme Happiness ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year 1915-1940 ** Verite * 1/2 Fabulous! * The Mystery Of Love & Sex ** An Octoroon at Polonsky Shakespeare Center *** 1/2 Fish In The Dark * The Audience *** Josephine And I *** Posterity * 1/2 The Hunchback Of Notre Dame ** Lonesome Traveler ** On The Twentieth Century *** Radio City Music Hall's New York Spring Spectacular ** 1/2 The Heidi Chronicles * The Tallest Tree In The Forest * 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1941-1965 *** Twelfth Night by Bedlam *** What You Will by Bedlam *** 1/2</p>
