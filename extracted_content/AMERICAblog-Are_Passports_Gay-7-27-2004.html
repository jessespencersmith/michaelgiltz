Are Passports Gay?
by Michael in New York  on 7/27/2004 10:50:00 AM
CNN.com reports that a man who married his partner once
Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage -- they've been togetherfor 23 years! -- was denied a passport under his new last name. This
is just one of the many examples of practical, day-to-day problems
raised when the US government tries to deny the reality of how
people are living. Canada and other countries will recognize gay
marriages, so eventually will the EU and it's just going to be
impossible for the US to treat legally recognized marriages by our
allies or individual states as second-class.
