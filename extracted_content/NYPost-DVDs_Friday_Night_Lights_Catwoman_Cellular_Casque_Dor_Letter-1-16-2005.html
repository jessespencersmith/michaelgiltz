catwoman 
zero stars 
Warner Bros., $27.95 
Michelle Pfeiffer was 
fantastic as Catwoman in 1992's 
"Batman Returns," so naturally 
Hollywood waited more than a 
decade to make this spinoff and 
gave the part to Halle Berry. 
Berry fills out the leather outfit 
nicely, but the adventure built 
around her is mind-numbingly 
banal. Few extras, because 
everyone involved wanted to 
forget this one. 
cellular *'/2 
New Line, $27.95 
Kim Basinger is kidnapped 
and locked in an attic with only 
a semi-destroyed telephone to 
save her life. Unfortunately, in 
"Cellular," her one call is 
answered by Ryan (Chris 
Evans), a knuckleheaded 
doofus who tries to help but 
merely stands by while her 
husband and son get kidnapped 
too. Thanks, dude. Also out: the 
tangled Julianne Moore thriller 
"The Forgotten" (Columbia 
TriStar, $28.95). 
casqueD'Or **"*'/2 Criterion, $39.95 
French director Jacques 
Becker is relatively unheralded 
here and even in France. But 
Criterion seems determined to Friday 
NightUghts ***'/2 Universal, $29.98 
Like the book it's 
based on, this drama 
about west Texas high 
school football 
captures the gutÂ­
wrenching pressure 
that boys are placed 
under when a state 
championship is all 
that matters to a small 
town. Lucas Black is a 
standout as Michael 
Winchell, the 
quarterback so 
intensely afraid of 
losing he never smiles. 
Extras include deleted 
scenes and a look at 
country artist Tim 
McGraw's turn as an 
obnoxious dad. 
undo this oversight by 
releasing his best films, 
including 1960's prison drama 
"Le Trou," 1954's noir gangster 
classic "Touches Pas Au Grisbi" 
and "Casque D'Or" a 1952 
classic on a turn-of-the-century 
doomed romance starring 
Simone Signoret. The usual 
thoughtful extras include silent 
footage from the set and a TV 
tribute. 
The Letter ***'/2 Warner Bros., $19.97 
No major star ever had more 
success playing unlikable 
characters than Bette Davis. In 
"The Letter" (1940), she's a 
slattern accused of murder who 
uses her wiles to avoid prison. 
It's one of a batch of movies 
chosen by fans to be released 
on DVD. Others include the 
rousing adventure "King 
Solomon's Mines" (1950), and 
the weepy "Random Harvest" 
(1942).</p>
