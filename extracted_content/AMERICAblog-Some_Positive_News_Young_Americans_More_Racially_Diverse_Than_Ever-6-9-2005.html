6/09/2005 10:37:00 PMNot all the news on Americablog has to be bleak. This frontpage story in USA Today is espeically fun because it's goodnews to us that the far right -- with its xenophobia and fear of"race-mixing" -- will see as bad news. In short, people under40 are far more racially diverse than people over 40 in the US.White-dominated America will be a thing of the past in aboutanother 40 years when our country will be a patchwork quilt ofpeople from all over the world. And since young people aregrowing up in this brave new world, they'll resist or ignoreentreaties to see blacks and Hispanics and Arabs as people tobe feared. (It's the same trend that means the far right willultimately lose out on pushing for hatred of gays -- youngpeople in America have grown up with gay friends andclassmates and they just don't care.) One especially tellingstatistic is on interracial marriage:Marriages across racial and ethnic lines jumped 65% in the1990s and make up one in 15 marriages in the USA, upfrom one in 23 in 1990, Frey says."Everyone realizes that we're a nation of diversitynow, and they want to celebrate it," says AllisonCohen, president of PeopleTalk, a market researchcompany in Wenham, Mass. "Americans have come tosee diversity in their workplace, in who their friendsare."
