already on disc 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
PARIS Hilton knows 
about instant gratifica­
tion. So it's only fitting 
that she and Nicole Richie 
will barely have had time 
to unpack their bags be­
fore "The Simple Life" 
TV show comes to DVD 
on Jan. 20. 
"It's the fastest release 
ever!" laughed one Fox 
Home Entertainment ex­
ecutive. "It's coming out 
on DVD just days after the 
final episode airs." 
The reasoning is simple: 
Ifl5 million people watch 
the season finale of the hit 
reality series, why wait 
one year or even six 
months to put it out on 
Dvm The show will be in -danger of looking like yes­
terday's news (reality 
shows have a half life of 
about 10 minutes), and 
you'll just have 
to spend money 
reminding peo­
ple about the 
show all over 
again. 
"The Simple 
Life" is the most 
dramatic exam­
ple of a growing 
trend for TV 
shows and mov­
ies. Studios eager 
to take advantage 
of the millions they 
spend promoting 
shows and movies 
-not to mention 
dipping into the 
DVD pot of gold 
right away -are re­
leasing the sets 
faster and faster. 
Season one of" Alias" 
came out just before sea­
son two debuted on ABC, 
and season two of "24" 
came out just before sea­
son three began on Fox. 
This lets hardcore fans 
start collecting and gives 
casual viewers a chance to 
catch up (especially im­
portant on serialized 
shows like "24," which ex­
plains why they are lead­
ing the DVD pack, instead 
of stand-alone stalwarts 
like "Law & Order"). 
This desire for instant 
pleasure has been building 
for awhile. Baseball fans 
get barraged with ads 
urging them to buy the 
World Series commemo­
rative DVD before the 
final out has been scored. 
Some TV miniseries air 
ads for the DVD and 
soundtrack before viewers 
find out how the story 
ends. And PBS was selling 
Ken Burns' epic "Jazz" 
even before the show had 
debuted. Series head to DVD faster to cash in on 
popularity. Some recent releases:
