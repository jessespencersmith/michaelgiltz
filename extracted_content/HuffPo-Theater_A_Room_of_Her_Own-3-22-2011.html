ROOM  *** out of ****
WOMEN'S PROJECT JULIA MILES THEATER
Like director Anne Bogart, I first read Virgina Woolf  as a
teenager. To The Lighthouse  felt so modern and bold
and fresh and yet completely accessible, it was a
revelation. Her stream of consciousness style was soinfluential it hardly seemed strange to me some 60 yearslater, but still I realized how exciting it was. Then Imoved on to her other masterpiece Mrs. Dalloway  and
other works both more and less enthralling on theirown, but always with a love for an artist who had scaledsuch peaks.

<p>Bogart and actress Ellen Lauren share their love of Woolf not through some sentimental one-woman
show that celebrates this iconic figure in the warmth and intelligence she so often displayed. Instead, theydelve into her mind and literally embody the thought processes of an artist. This work by Jocelyn Clarkeadroitly mixes lectures, essays, letters, diary entries and her fiction to capture Woolf's razor-sharp clarityon so many issues.
It begins simply, with Woolf already seated in the auditorium when you enter, highlighted by a spotlight.
Abruptly, she launches into a lecture based on the famous essay "A Room Of One's Own." Wryly amusingbut serious, personable but penetrating, simply delivering Woolf's voice can provide an exceptional
evening of theater (as evidenced by Eileen Atkins' A Room Of One's Own  and Vita and Virginia .) But the
pleasures of this Room  are more intellectual than emotional.
At first, Lauren seems a bit mannered as she crosses the stage, but naturalistic. Slowly, certain tics
appear. When she discusses writing, one hand flies up and points a finger down and then slowly descendsuntil it rests on an open palm. Another arm gets a bit restless and has to be pushed back into place or itflies off on its own, reaching for the sky. As the show progresses, the stylized movements become moreand more predominant. Slowly, you realize that at times Woolf is lowering gently to the ground at
unexpected moments or is pinned against the back wall during an especially revealing discourse and yet
it all proceeds so smoothly you don't question it in the least.
Lauren handles the transitions between conversation/lecture and the choreographed movement, from
public lecture to private memory with ease. It climaxes in a wonderful moment where Woolf's insight intowhat has made her an artist is captured in all its exhilarating thrill by a frenzied explosion into puredance. The tech elements are handled superbly, especially the movement by Barney O'Hanlon and thesoundscape by Darron L. West, all brought together by Bogart and Lauren. Fans of Woolf andadventurous dance/theater shouldn't hesitate to head to this production by Women's Project  and SITI
Company.
