            <p>Books:  Richard  Russo's  Too  Polite
Memoir  About  His  Maddening,Memorable  Mother
ELSEWHERE:  A  MEMOIR  BY  RICHARD
RUSSO  
$25.95; Knopf
Novelist Richard Russo  tackles the memoir
form to tell the story of his difficult mother and
the town -- Gloversville -- that served as alodestone for both of them throughout theirlives. She was always battling to get away fromthat narrow, mean, dead-end little world andthen immediately regretting the rupture andromanticizing her time there. He would bescared to return there in reality but do soconstantly in his fiction, where Gloversvilleserved as the inspiration for his best work.
Russo's dad tells the kid at one point that his
mother is "nuts" and it takes a lifetime forRusso to realize that's not merely a figure ofspeech. Russo spends decades dealing with hereccentricities and her "nerves." He is so used to
his mother's rituals and needs and moods that cripple her before she's off on anothermanic high that he can't imagine her morbid fear of the mentally ill (not to mention thecolor yellow, an obsessive need for routine and so much more) is rooted in the unspokenacknowledgement that she is one of them.
Quite a bit of the story is painfully funny as his mother moves and moves and moves
again, every single apartment and home falling short, then absolutely perfect and then --
after a few weeks of residence -- deemed a total failure and she's off on the hunt for the
perfect domicile. Whether a teenager heading cross country to move to the west coastwith his mom in tow, barreling down a highway they can barely navigate with not nearlyenough money or sense between them or a married father of two children who stillschedules his entire life around his mother's needs, Elsewhere  is pointed and amusing and
frustrating and exhausting.
It's also scrupulously fair. Russo details his mother's reaction to this and that situation
with patient care, seemingly worried even now about showing her in an unflattering light.He understood her thought process, he could anticipate her reaction to most situationsand he wants us to know how it all worked. What is fascinating to him ultimately becomesa little repetitive and dry. Instead of telling her story, Russo explains it, which is theenemy of drama. For example, Russo details her reading habits at one point and why she

<p>liked this sort of book and not that sort of book and it's interesting but not exactly
riveting. You're never bored but you're not exactly enthralled either.
Those who love this genre will find Elsewhere  a polished entry while children with parents
suffering from dementia will certainly discover the final section sadly familiar. Russo
never pities his mother or explains her away and you won't either. But you might wishhe'd turned her into a character and let her loose in all her frustrating, fascinating glory.He's the dutiful son to the end, careful to present her narrative with as much supportingfacts and commentary and analysis and understanding as possible. But what she reallyneeded was her son the author to let those facts come to life without any fear over whatshe'd make of it.
