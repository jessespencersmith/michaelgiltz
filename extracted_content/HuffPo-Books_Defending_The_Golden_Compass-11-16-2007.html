New Line's movie The Golden Compass  starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig opens on
December 7, bringing an acclaimed best-selling fantasy trilogy by author Philip Pullman  to its
widest audience yet. And after years of accolades and unstinting praise, Pullman is finally getting
his wish for controversy: the far right is attacking his work as pernicious, evil, anti-God andbasically the kiddie version of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses.
The attack, such as it is, is being led by William Donohue, the blustering, bigoted head of the far-
right political group Catholic League. This group poses as a defender of the Catholic faith but
devotes itself to partisan political attacks against anyone opposed to a right-wing, Republican
agenda. Donohue insists the books are virulently anti-Catholic, and is organizing attacks on the
film (which he sees as a Trojan horse to encourage kids to read the books - making it the most
expensive book promotion campaign in history), and demands that schools and teachers ban the
books and not teach them to anyone. If you assign these books to your students, Donohue will
insist you are an anti-Catholic bigot and should be denounced, if not driven from your job.
First, let's look at the charge that the books are anti-
Catholic and then question whether Donohue is areasonable spokesperson for the Catholic Church thatshould be given legitimacy by the traditional media.
The Golden Compass  is the first book in a trilogy by
Pullman entitled His Dark Materials. It is easily the most acclaimed fantasy work in many years
and looks set to take its place alongside landmarks like The Lord Of The Rings  and The Chronicles
Of Narnia,  both also written by Oxford scholars like Pullman and both of which he would puckishly
take issue.  In short, it's the story of a young girl named Lyra who lives in an alternate universe
quite similar to ours but filled with witches, an all powerful Magisterium and armored talkingbears. Lyra (and her daemon -- sort of a personified soul) finds herself on a scary adventure in theNorth and ultimately in other worlds that involves missing children, sexuality and the fate of theworld.
Pullman was greatly inspired by Milton's Paradise Lost,  another work that has been alternately

The End Of
 What Are You
 SNL: Madonna And
 Reality Star Jadepraised and condemned over time but is now one of the landmarks in epic poetry. Paradise Lost
features the Devil as its central, sympathetic protagonist, mixes in pagan symbols with religious
icons, and grapples mightily with sexuality. It is also taught in virtually every academic institution
in the Western world and any serious student of theology or literature must grapple with it at one
point. If Donohue objects to His Dark Materials,  he must object to its equally scandalous
inspiration and immediately call for a ban on Milton's Paradise Lost  and insist that anyone who
reads it or teaches it is an anti-Catholic bigot.
But is His Dark Materials  full of hate for Catholicism or Christianity in general? Pullman himself
is most certainly an atheist and no fan organized religion in general.  But his books are most
scathing towards dogmatism and unquestioned authority, not any one faith. There are brave (gay)
angels in later volumes -- which must have thrown Donohue into conniptions if he got that far --not to mention the death of a God-like figure, and a church that is kidnapping and torturingchildren in an obsessive desire to rub out the "sin" of sexuality. It's bold and compelling andultimately very challenging indeed - just like most great literature. As a practicing Catholic, I foundthem enthralling, fascinating and have shared them with friends, neices and nephews and theirparents.
Among the many people of faith who have found the book's serious grappling with issues of
sexuality and belief worthwhile is no less than Rowan Williams, the head of the Anglican Church
and that religion's equivalent to the Pope. If the head of one of the world's major religions canchampion these books, along with countless other people of faith, literary critics, scholars andmere fans of excellent fantasy fiction, then clearly it cannot be denounced out of hand as evil orinappropriate to read and discuss. Parents are always responsible for deciding what books areappropriate for their children at what age. But anyone who would ban or denounce His DarkMaterials  and try to keep it and The Wizard of Oz  and the Harry Potter books and The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn and Catcher In The Rye and Are You There God, IIt's Me Margaret  and
countless other classics from everyone else and insist these books are dangerous or evil is justfoolish and ignorant.
It all comes down to how you practice your faith. If, like Donohue, you want people to unthinkingly
accept whatever they are told, then anything that encourages thought and debate is dangerous. If
you believe that an unexamined faith is meaningless, if you believe that in fact it is your duty to
question your faith and yourself and how to practice that faith in the world today, then no movie,no book, no CD will be anything other than an opportunity to talk, discuss and contemplate what itmeans to be a person of faith.
William Donohue would have none of that. An angry, bullying, bigoted figure,  he resembles
nothing so much as the notorious anti-Semite Father Charles Coughlin.  Donohue has denounced
Hollywood as "controlled by secular Jews" and says "Hollywood likes anal sex." He calls
homosexuality the "gay death style," spews venom and hate at anyone who talks about the horrificchild abuse scandals that continue to rock the Church, blaming it mostly on gays and the mediaand deep-pocketed lawyers and even accuses people of lying about being abused to cash in. Checkout the Today show  clip where he is so angry and nasty and unhinged compared to the calm,
reasoned guests also on the air.
It's remarkable that Donohue is still invited on TV after so many blow-ups on air. But whatever you
think about his politics, Donohue simply doesn't comport himself in a Christian manner. Hebullies, he yells, he mocks, he spews hate - he does everything in fact except behave with Christianhumility and compassion. TV producers who keep booking him because he "makes good TV"should be ashamed of themselves.
If you want to know more about why Donohue hates The Golden Compass  so much, he'll gladly sell
you a copy of his 23 page booklet for only $5 each.  (If it's so dangerous, why not simply post his
pamphlet online for free?) Or you could simply buy the entire "His Dark Materials" trilogy on sale
at Amazon for $13.50. Since the United States is not yet a theocracy, happily the choice is stillyours.

I hadn't heard of the movie before, but the very fact that Bill Donahue doesn't like it makes me want to
see it and read the books as well. Is there a list of movies and books opposed by the Catholic League?It might make for some interesting reading and viewing.

My family have greatly enjoyed Phil Pullman'sseries. A riveting story, really. It's fair topoint out that Pullman is not respectful toreligion, to put it mildly. This is not aChristmas story, by any means. If anything,just the opposite, if that's possible. But,*millions* of readers around the world adorethese books.
There's an interesting analysis in this month's Atlantic:
'Pullman"s books have sold 15 million copies worldwide, although it"s difficult to imagine adolescent
novels any more openly subversive. The series, known collectively as His Dark Materials, centers onLyra Belacqua, a preteen orphan who"s pursued by a murderous institution known as "the Magisterium."Or to use the more familiar name, "the Holy Church." In its quest to eradicate sin, the Church sanctionsexperiments involving the kidnap and torture of hundreds of children"experiments that separate body

http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200712/religious-moviesThe animosity toward 'Magisterium' occurs in
a parallel universe inhabited by Lyra 'Silvertongue' (& her inseparable 'daemon' Pantalaimon), not in ours, where the Church is seemingly more malevolent than our own. Perhaps the American church has trouble with
the likelihood of multiple universes, which is at the heart 
of what Pullman's works are about.
The 3 novels in the series tell a truly amazing story. And 
one can only hope the movie(s) will tell the story as well 
as Phil Pullman conceived it.

Read Pullman's trilogy when I was over forty. Imaginative, provocative, impressive, just the type of
challenge in which young minds can immerse and older ones can revel. Just the type of thing that
would rile Donohue's ilk.
If the screenplay is anywhere near the quality of the books, it (they) will be block busters.
