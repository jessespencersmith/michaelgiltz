            <p>Scott Glenn was in an out-of-the-way part 
of Nicaragua, cut off from the outside 
world, working as hard as he had in y·ears. 
. And yet he felt spoiled. Glenn was teamed 
. with director Ken Loach on the political 
drama "Carla's Song," and he reveled in 
Loach's unorthodox approach to filmmak­
ing, which combines imprmisation with a 
thorough exploration of every character. 
"The experience of working with Ken 
was so unique and powerful," says Glenn. "I 
said to someone there, 'I can't go into 
another movie right after this. I'd get firedl 
I'd spend the whole time say'ing, \ Vhy can't 
you sh()('lt the \I'hoil: thint: in sequence: 
\'Vhy Cln't we do major sCenes that ,lren't 
going to appear in the final film juSt to 
know where our ch;lr;lCters ;lre: \ \ 1w can't . . 
we impro\;ise" 
"So this person said, "\ Veil, \lhn do you 
W,lnt to do:' And I sOlid, 'The'ltre."" 
The gods must h,l\'e been listening. The 
next day, Glenn dro\'e back to ;\ lanagua 
,md discovered;] message \I'aiting, asking if 
he was still interested in doing a piece he 
Photo by Michael Benablb had read some years earlier, Eric 
Overmye;"s "Dark R'lpnlre." 
He was. Vlhile most people know the 
rugged, bconic Glenn from his film work 
("The Right Stuff," "The Silence of the 
Lambs," the current '''Courage Under 
Fire"), he is no stranger to the s~ge . True, 
his last 1 ew York outing was replacing John 
Malkovich in "Burn This;" a less-than-eas y 
task made harder by having a mere nine 
days of preparation. Still, his performance 
earned him the notice of a young director 
named SCOtt Ellis, (See Story, page 22) 
Cut to 1996. Immediately after agreeing 
to helm "D;lrk Rapture," Ellis decided that 
Glenn \I'ould be perfect for the lead-total­
ly unaware of Glenn's previous acquain­
tance \I'ith the shq\l'. 
Noll' at Second Stage, Overmye r's "the­
ater noir" is a fast-moving drama where the 
trick\' P;lft is figurin'g out who is lying a~d 
who is telling the!truth (if anyone). Glenn 
plays a screenwriter-and thief-who may 
or ma)' not have set fire to his own hOllse,

ENCORE aJ "\iVhat I love ;1hout "D;lrk R;1pnlre" is [holt 
everybody lies," S;1\'S director Scott Ellis. 
"These are not nice people," 
COl11int: fr()111 this I'el'\' nicc 1>1;1n, th;n 
statement seems a hir odd ;It first, hur in ,1 
way, "Dark Rapl1lre" is the logical next step 
in Ellis' directorial progression. Ellis made 
his name with the Off-Bro'ldw,l)' Kander 
and Ebb revue "And [he \Norld Goes 
'Round" and the Broadway smash "She 
Loves Me," bright and sunny mllsicals, 
both, The following year, his p,llerre dark­
ened slightly, as he t,lCkled a revival of 
\Villiamlnge's "Picnic," followed last spring 
by Turgenev's "A Montll in tile Couno'v," 
botl1 for Roundabout'. 
Then «lme J.lsr Ell1's revil'al of Stephen 
Sondheim's "Comp,lIllI," also for 
Roundabout. Not only were [here nasty 
characters onst,lge (well, Joanne anyway) 
~I' MAY·IUNE but some Ulltlsu,llk n,1Sf\' criticisl11, .\ l:1king 
m;lrrcrs \I'orse, "Comp;lI1\'" suffercd ;1 I'~I'\'

Perhaps th,lt experience gal'e Ellis this t;lste 
for nastier, edgier material' If so, he isn't 
showing his hand ,lny' more than the 
tightlipped ch'lr;1Cters in "Dark Rapture." 
"Painful''' he repeats, when asked if 
that's hO\l' he feels about the "Company" 
fiasco today', "[\'0. It was an exo',lordinary' 
group of ;lctorS ;lIld 1 walked '1\1';1\' frOI11 tll'lt 
experience witl1 ,1 shol\' I \I',lS proud or. It 
\1',15 tile best cast l\'e e\'er had," 
Ellis 111;1\' not he ,lble to Sol\' th;lt for long-, 
since "Dark R<lprure" is tile first in ;1 SITing 
of high profile projects, including a produc­
tion of"De<ltll of.-\ Salesman," st;lrringJudd 
Hirsch. But next up, he jUl1lps into ,lIl eight­
\I'eek workshop of ,1 nell' 
hander and Ehh musicll 
called "Steel Piers." Set 
during an .-\ti:1nric City 
dance 1113ratllon, it reunites 
him witll '''Round's'' chore­
ographer, SUS,lIl Stroman. 
And wllike "Company'," a 
Broad\l'al' run for "Steel 
Piers" h;1s just one obstacle 
to o\·ercome. 
Is he \I'aiting for some­
one to h,lIld him eight or 
so million clolhlrs to 
finance it: "~o, it's not 
thar." he 5,1\'S hrighth-. "It's
