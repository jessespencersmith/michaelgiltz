Yes, Luckily for 'Cymbeline!'Theater: Burton and Taylor! Astaire and Rogers! Linklater and Rabe?Yes, Luckily for 'Cymbeline!'CYMBELINE *** out of **** SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARKIn October, James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson will start performing in that chestnut The Gin Game. I hope LilyRabe and Hamish Linklater take the time to see those old pros in it, because some day -- if we're lucky -- they'llbe doing The Gin Game as well. True, their artistic union is relatively new compared to fabled performers likeHume Cronyn & Jessica Tandy or the combustible Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor. And Linklater had a pointin one recent article: Lily Rabe has great chemistry with everyone.So let's not turn them into an "event," or a nickname like "Rabelater" or "Hamilily." Let's just enjoy them for whatthey are: two very talented actors. I'd go see Lily Rabe in anything. I'd go see Hamish Linklater in anything. Andif they're together in a show, why that's twice the reason to go see whatever it is.In this case the show is Cymbeline, the latest Shakespeare in the Park offering (not to mention the latest to offerthis duo in leading roles). Shakespeare In The Park remains a treasure for New York City and Linklater andRabe are becoming a terrific annual tradition for that series. A central complaint is the play itself. It's almost ananonymous template for all the other romances: two lovers at cross ends, a foolish wager/moment of doubt onpart of the man (men are such foolish beasts), a little cross-dressing, some comic relief and an all's well thatends well wrap-up explaining who did what to whom and when. It's all here, though without the greatness ofShakespeare at his best.But even so-so Shakespeare can be great fun, especially when performed with élan. From top to bottom, this isa strong, delightful cast having a ball under the summer stars. True, the outdoor setting and short rehearsal cansometimes encourage a loosey-goosey attitude that feels indulgent. But this time the playfulness feels earnedand rooted in character. Kate Burton and Patrick Page are royalty indeed. Toss in Raúl Esparza as a big bandcrooner/bad guy, Jacob Ming-Trent (so good in Father Comes Home From The Wars) in numerous smaller rolesand of course Linklater and Rabe as two lovers and you've got yourself a winning night of theater.On the down side, the set by Riccardo Hernandez is basically just a frame for the action. All for the good, butsome crates piled up on both sides of the stage rather randomly are marked by the names of Shakespeareplays. Not a lot of them, mind you. Just Hamlet (twice) and King Lear. WTF? And two tragedies? It's like theystarted to fiddle with an idea and then stopped. Peppering them with romances or characters from romances ornothing at all would make more sense.Further, director Daniel Sullivan peters out of ideas by the end, an end that to be fair is labored with countlesssummaries of the story we've just seen. Plus the battle scene is ramshackle, with no sense of what is actuallygoing on. After a very strong first half, the second starts to drag, despite the goodwill the cast engenders atevery turn,On the bright side, the doubling of many roles pays dividends. Since the play is no great shakes, it keeps theevening lively when you get to see Burton and Page double their parts while others play three or four roles.</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=38299bd2-5849-4b76-b90e-b3ea3ddf5c94&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&2/3Instead of a cost-saving measure and instead of just filling the stage with lesser talents (which is tiring in alesser play), this encourages a "let's put on a show" atmosphere.Finally, we have Rabe and Linklater. Though little is motivated, they both bring the lovers Imogen andPosthumus to vibrant life. His despair over her imagined betrayal (while absurdly illogical; I mean, they justparted!) is wrenching. Her scene at his supposed gravesite is also fully invested in pain over the loss of theiryoung love. And Linklater's mouth-breathing take on his rival Cloten is enjoyable precisely because he takes thisfigure of fun with due seriousness. When Linklater as Cloten is spitting out his anger at Rabe and showering herwith spittle, the layers of amusement are manifold. When Rabe tells him with deadpan earnestness, "I hate you,"it's witheringly funny. For all the flaws of the play and the lesser flaws of this production, this Cymbeline is onenot to miss. After all, it features Linklater and Rabe, or should I say Linklater & Rabe. They remain a classicpairing.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2 Parade in Concert at Lincoln Center ** 1/2 Hamilton at the Public *** The World Of Extreme Happiness ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year 1915-1940 ** Verite * 1/2 Fabulous! * The Mystery Of Love & Sex ** An Octoroon at Polonsky Shakespeare Center *** 1/2 Fish In The Dark * The Audience *** Josephine And I *** Posterity * 1/2 The Hunchback Of Notre Dame ** Lonesome Traveler ** On The Twentieth Century *** Radio City Music Hall's New York Spring Spectacular ** 1/2 The Heidi Chronicles * The Tallest Tree In The Forest * 1/2 Broadway By The Year: 1941-1965 *** Twelfth Night by Bedlam *** What You Will by Bedlam *** 1/2 Wolf Hall Parts I and II ** 1/2 Skylight *** Nellie McKay at 54 Below *** Ludic Proxy ** 1/2 It Shoulda Been You **  Finding Neverland ** 1/2</p>
