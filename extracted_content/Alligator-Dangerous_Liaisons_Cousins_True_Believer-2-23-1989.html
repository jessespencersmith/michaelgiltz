, This is a Ol~ ~out everything 
except love. ~~1tre lovers, to be 
sure; as well as lust, passion, infi­
delity and betrayal. But love? No. 
There's none to be found. They are a dangerous pair, in­
deed, and their attention is soon 
focused upon revenge. Merteuil 
wants to humiliate a former lover 
who abandoned her by seeing his 
intended bride - a young, con­
vent-educated woman of unques­
tioned virtue -debauched by the 
usually-willing Valmont. struggle to out-do each other in 
outrageous schemes. 
Close and Malkovich give inti­
mate, sharp performances per­
fectly suited to a world where a 
raised eyebrow or a veiled remark 
can be as deadly as any sword 
thrust. They delight in the shal­
low, brittle repartee that is the 
hallmark of the movie . 
. The story is set ill the 1700s and 
concerns Val mont, a rakish aristo­
crat played by John Malkovich 
with vicious charm. His sole occu­
pation in life is the highly visible 
conquest of women. He is a very However, he already is caught 
up· in a pretty puzzle of his own. 
Valmont has set himself the chal­
lenge of seducing Madame de 
Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer). Ma­
dame is renowned for her high 
moral standing and chaste mar­
riage, but Valmont has more in 
mind than simply subverting her 
beliefs and bedding her. But it is the strength of Danger-~~~~~~~~ 
J~sr. man.", 
. :~~V«ltnont IS aided in his esca-
paa~s " by the equally rapacious 
.e.t~qu.ise de Merteuil (Glenn 
.C;:,los.e), a woman w.i~h a consider­
~Ie' reputation of her own and a 
~~.:lover of his. It would be 
IcUIt to determine which of the 
two is more caustic and unforgiv­
ing, but Merteuil seems to have 
the edge. 
"I thought betrayal was your 
favorite word," he notes at one 
poi~~. "No, no,:' ~~¢. re.sf.0 .~d;; ~e .• 
"fiou.~ .ly.: "CTue~ t has .. a~b~~r 
~ ·t.~_~.t.~qn~t.y?Jb .. <~i.I\~? ". ;, .. He wants Madame to maintain 
her religious convictions and so­
cial mores, but sleep with him any­
way. It is a delicate balance of 
submission and regret that Valm­
ont imagines will provide him 
with a unique and satisfying plea­
sure. 
Merteuil is intrigued, and offers 
as an incentive a night with her 
. shQuld he prove successful. Natu­
rally, sexual i,ntrigue and unfore­
seEm complications ensue as they ous Liaisons to move beneath that 
amusing, entertaining surface. It 
shows Valmont and Merteuil in all 
their malice and vanity and then 
slowly makes us feel for them. 
Director Stephen Frears has al­
ways dealt in scathing, topical 
humor, but here he seems tem­
pered a bit by pity. He dares us to 
stare into the small-miI)ded, self­
centered face of Merteuil and not 
catch a glimpse of ourselves . 
* * 1/2 Cousins 
Oaks Four West 
No one would ever accuse direc­
tor Joel Schumacher of repeating 
himself. His diverse and largely 
unsuccessful list of credits include' 
the utterly forgettable Lily Tomlin Vik,1( tlflJ.ftg".16k, IJ./{tl tIft-MIe p,,~ Il«t p,. tit, eu,,,1J. lir 
/J1J.1fJU"1IfIS LluII,,&,. 
vehicle The Incredible Shrinking 
Woman, the "Little Chill" teen­
angst drama St. Elmo's Fire and the 
not very scary or funny vampire 
comedy The Lost Boys. 
Add to that list Cousins, a rela­
tively mature, romantic drama 
adapted from the 1975 French 
film, Cousin, Cousine. It headlines 
Ted Danson as Larry and Isabena 
Rossellini as Maria, but the real 
star of the fi~m is Schumacher's 
direction. He shows a subtlety and 
eye for detail that keeps Cousins 
bursting with life and true to its 
European origins. 
Wedding s are the major catalyst for change and they are as com­
mon as kisses here. At the first 
wedding, Tish (Sean Young) dal­
lies a little too long with Tom 
(William Petersen). Their respec­
tive spouses, Larry and Maria, 
suspect something is amiss and 
arrange a meeting to discuss what 
-if anything -should be done .. 
. What they do is fall in love. The 
charm of the movie lies in how 
they handle it. These are adults, 
and they devote a great deal of 
time and energy to thinking 
through thei! t£5lPns and how it. 
will affect the people they love. 
Maria is concerned about her</p>
<p>daught,r, Larry with his son and 
th~ beth Jake great pains to treat 
their spouses w!th respect. Only 
Tish and t'om act truly i{responsi­
bl~ and, tlotablJ, they are the un-
o ctef'S ina very 
llappy movie. 
Larry and Maria's tete-a-tetes 
are the main focus of the story, but 
$chumacher never lets us forget 
that life is going on all around 
them. He trains his camera on odd 
minor characters and intriguing 
faces in the crowd. The result is a 
refreshingly bUsy atmosphere . 
Some of the comic diversions -
such as two buddi~s who are los­
ers In love and a kvetching Italian 
grandmother -fall flat. But more 
often than not, they spice up a 
familiar story with touches of 
strangeness . 
Uoyd Bridges is very funny as 
Larry's father who enjoys life too 
much to be polite about his needs 
and de6ires, and Keith Coogan is 
hysterical as Mitch, Larry's son 
and a "multi-media artist with an 
em phasis orr video and alien­
ation." 
**** *** ** * o .. Schumacher has jumbled his 
characters together with a great 
deal of .kill .and Cousins is alive 
with people. Maybe the upcoming 
St, Elmo's Fire II won't be so bad 
after an. 
* ... True Believer 
Royal Park 
This is a 'iB" movie in every 
sense of the word. Like all liB'" 
movies, True Believer features a 
convoluted but predictable plot in­
volving corruption at the highest 
level, IIOme tense action, a cynical 
hero and strong acting all around. 
James Woods stars as Eddie 
Dodd, a burnt-out attorney who 
has gone from high-profile liberal 
causes to liberal uses of marijuana 
and slimy clients. As one of the 
drug dealers he defends put it: 
liEd die Dodd. Everyone sh6uld 
own one." 
Naturally, someone has to come 
into Eddie's life and shake him out 
of his lethargy. That someone is 
Roger Baron (Robert Downey, Jr.), 
a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed youngster fresh out of law school 
who is willing to work for peanuts 
because his "life was changed" by 
one of Eddie's early court cases. 
Roger is pampered and well­
dressed, a conspicuous practi­
tioner of conspicuous 
consumption. It's a nice irony of 
Tnu Belin1er that the voice of so­
cial conscience for a pot-smoking 
'60s radical is an '80s yuppie in 
designer clothes. Their righteous 
anger is stoked by an 8-year-old 
murder case in which a Korean 
named Shu Kai Kim was wrongly 
imprisoned. Naturally, Eddie and 
Roger work for free to ·see justice 
done. Yugi Okumoto give$ a 
tough, interesting twist, to the in.­
nocent-man-behind-bars and he is 
just one of many fine supporting 
actors. Robert Downey, Jr. doesn't 
hav~ much to do as the side kick, 
but he does it well. 
The main attraction here is def­
jnitely Woods, who gives one of 
his more appealing and humorous 
performances. But even he can't 
make us a true believer in the 
hokey plot they're trapped in. 
Stop reading this trash and get to a theater. 
Worth the $5-a-pop evenlng price. 
· . . . Worth a matinee price, tops. 
· . Worth renting on videocassette: 
· Worth catching on HBO, maybe.</p>
