From the Publisher: A definitive biography of Otis Redding, the musical
artist who was widely regarded as the quintessential soul singer of the
1960s, timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Redding's iconic
performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival.  Otis Redding remains a
living presence in the canon of American popular music on the strength ofsuch classic hits as "(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay," “I’ve Been Loving
You Too Long (To Stop Now),” "Try a Little Tenderness," and "Respect," a
song that Redding wrote and recorded before Aretha Franklin made itimmortal.   As a singer, songwriter, bandleader, and arranger, Redding was
the chief architect of the distinctly southern, gospel-inflected style ofrhythm & blues associated with Stax Records in Memphis.  Yet, while
Redding’s music has long served as the gold standard of 1960s soul, an
aura of myth…

What We Say
Author Jonathan Gould is not fooling around. You want to read about the brilliant, died-too-soon singer Otis Redding? Ok,
but first Gould is gonna school you on how all of American music is inextricably tied up with race. He'll give a sharp,knowing rundown of the minstrel shows that swept the nation, why record labels embraced hillbilly music (ie. country) but
turned its nose up at "race" records (yep, prejudice), the rise of radio stations and why a focus on r&b only happened when
TV stole the attention of most households and so on. In lesser hands, this might have felt like the inevitable padding out ofa life short on details (Redding was rarely interviewed, kept no journal and died at the age of 26). Not here. Gould beginsShare This Book

<p>with Redding's ancestors and then his childhood, eventually moving on to chart his career and the rise of indie r&b record
labels (obviously including Stax) in engaging detail. The book begins with Redding's monumental performance at Monterey,
flashes back to the beginning and ends with his creative leap forward with the song "(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay," a
record so terrific it might well have hit #1 on the charts even if he hadn't died tragically in a plane crash months earlier.One can't help wondering what this artist just coming into his own might have accomplished. But Gould does justice to whathe did achieve and paints a vivid, passionate picture of how one can't appreciate Redding or the rise of soul music withoutlearning more about the never-ending struggle over race in America. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
One of Men's Journal's "Best Books of May 2017" “An excellent and definitive biography… A master storyteller,
Gould tackles Redding’s life by planting his flag firmly at the crossroads of individual genius and social andcultural context… [His] fabulous portrait…provides Redding with the “Respect” he richly deserves. Highlyrecommended.” —Library Journal (starred review) "A music biography with the depth to do its subject justice.Otis Redding (1941-1967) ranks high in the pantheon of 1960s musical luminaries, so it's fitting that [OtisRedding] ranks equally high among such work focusing on popular musical artists.... Better late than never, the
soul master receives his considerable due in this superbly researched and written biography." —Kirkus Reviews
(starred review) "Gould vividly brings to life the man Stax Records boss Jim Steward called 'a walking
inspiration'.... From his supreme triumphs to his one last heart-breaking phone-call to Zelma, devotees and soul
scholars alike could not wish for a more thorough and sensitive portrait." —Kris Needs, Mojo “Nuanced and well-researched…. [Otis Redding] belongs in the hands of anyone who cares about soul music in the sixties.” —Booklist
