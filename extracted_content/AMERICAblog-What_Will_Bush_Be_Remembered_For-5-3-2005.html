5/03/2005 09:12:00 PMAn angry editorial by Eugene Robinson in the Washington Postechoes my feelings. Bush thinks he's going to be rememberedfor liberating the Middle East when in fact his legacy is adebasing of what America stands for by the callous, widespreaduse of torture.Some prisoners were "rendered" to cooperatingcountries where old-fashioned fingernail-pulling is aroutine investigative technique. Others have simply"disappeared," as if the U.S. government were someLatin American junta whose generals weargold-braided epaulets as big as vultures. Mostprisoners have been given neither adequate militarynor civilian rights. Many don't know why they werearrested or what charges they face.It may be that these are all terrible people who wishto harm the United States -- we have no way ofknowing, because the supposed evidence is secret.But even if they are, this mistreatment is wrong. Ifthe price we pay for complete safety is completeabandonment of our ideals, the price is too high.How can President Bush preach to the world aboutdemocracy, about transparency, about the rule of law,and at the same time disregard national andinternational law at will? What message can VladimirPutin be hearing? Or the dictators in Beijing? Or themullahs in Tehran?The thing is, history tends to be relentless in pursuit of thetruth -- and its judgments tend to be harsh.
