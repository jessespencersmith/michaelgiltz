RESULTS SHOW : Siobhan Magnus, the quirky,
punkish contestant who could shatter glass with her
high notes was sent home tonight. Though she'd never
been in the bottom three, Siobhan found herself thereWednesday with Michael Lynche (who had been in
danger of going home til the judges used their save)
and Casey James (who was in the bottom three fortwo weeks running). She was composed and gracious,hugging her family and then belting out Aretha
Franklin's "Think" at the finale. With industry
supporters like producer Steve Lillywhite and apassionate fanbase, Siobhan will definitely have a
recording deal and a chance to prove her outsider
attitude can translate into art. If singing were an Olympic event -- whoever hits the highest note and
holds it the longest wins -- then Siobhan would be a gold medalist. I've been puzzled by her passionatefans and "Think" exemplified that: it was utterly bland and indistinct, with everyone just waiting till she
wailed at the end. But perhaps writing her own songs and collaborating with others will bring out her
true talent.
The show was packed with filler, from a very forced (and long) plug for Shrek Forever After  to an
extended look at the Ford ad (this one centering on vampires) and final hugs all around. Rascal Flatts
were ok on their own and with Shakira, who performed "Gypsy." Lady Antebellum were good with their
massive hit "Need You Now." And I was most excited to see Sons Of Sylvia,  which sounds like a klezmer
band but is actually the Clark Brothers reincarnated. They won the blink and you missed it summer
reality series The Next Great American Band  and were really good. I kept looking for their album but
they got lost in the shuffle of collapsing record labels. Now they've morphed from a wholesome Christian
country band into moody all-black wearing rockers opening for Carrie Underwood (who came on the
show to introduce them). Their album just came out and I can't wait to hear it but I'm certain they're funlive no matter what.

<p>Next week is Sinatra Week with Harry Connick Jr. serving as mentor. I'll keep looking to see which of the
thousands of songs he recorded is up for grabs and pray no one does "New York, New York."
So here's a question: do you think the Save was wasted on Michael Lynche and should have been used for
Siobhan?
PERFORMANCE REVIEW : On Shania Twain  night, all the contestants shined...except for perennial
front-runner Crystal Bowersox who deservedly got poor reviews from all the judges. I was worried when
country night limited the singers just to Shania Twain songs, even if she is one of the best selling country
artists of all time. It just seemed too narrow and small a songbook -- heck, she's only got four albums and
26 hits on the country charts. But in fact there were enough decent songs to go around.
LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang "You're Still The One," a #1 hit from Come On Over,  the best-selling album of all
time by a female artist.  Shania proved a capable mentor and encouraged Lee to start the song with just
piano and then add in guitar so it would have somewhere to go. He had a so-so beginning and end but
was pretty strong on the chorus, even though his phrasing proves he is singing the melody and not the
words. And every moment when he's not singing, Lee looks lost and anonymous. That's just not a good
sign as far as star power is concerned. Surprisingly, all four judges praise him.
MICHAEL LYNCHE  -- Sang "It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing," a great title for a ballad. Sporting a
horrible jacket with a turned up collar, Michael was colorless throughout the song until he delivered a
lovely falsetto moment at the finale. Sure, he's in the Luther Vandross vein but as Simon pointed out, notin the same league. Wet is indeed the opposite of dry and Simon meant Michael's performance was moremelodramatic than emotionally convincing. I don't quite agree; I didn't think it had much impact at all,though his voice is nice. Forgettable and that could send him home.
CASEY JAMES  -- Sang "Don't," a bonus track on Twain's greatest hits album that came and went. After
a few weeks of being a competent front man for a bar band, Casey concentrated on his singing. Shania
was right that he might lack confidence but at least tonight he showed more personality than he has in a
while. And Kara's necklace is gigantic. Sorry, but I just noticed it.
CRYSTAL BOWERSOX  -- Sang "No One Needs To Know," another #1 hit from Twain when they were
coming fast and furious. For an artist sometimes criticized as barely country at all, it was also a notably
country sounding tune for Twain. And Crystals' arrangement reflected that. (Though it hardly had the
bluegrass sound of Nickel Creek as Randy suggested.) Nothing clicked here. The arrangement sounded
thin and awkward and Crystal was out of sync with the band and the backup singers. Her voice was in a
higher range where it has less personality and she only sounded like herself right towards the end.Should she avoid happy songs? No, but she should avoid being defensive and challenging the judges.
Crystal kept talking back when she should have taken her weak reviews humbly. The problem was not
that the tone was smaller and lighter; that was a welcome change. The problem was that her singingwasn't very good. After finally shedding the aura of above-it-ness, Crystal takes a step back. (Mind you,
she's still the best and going to win.)
AARON KELLY  -- Sang "You've Got A Way," a power ballad Billboard once properly called "wedding
ready." This is Aaron's strong suit of course and he righted the ship once and for all. He built the song
very nicely and had a big finale of the sort Idol  fans love. It won't get any better for him, so if he's in the
bottom three again, we know his days are numbered. Saying he sang the song to his mom was the perfect
capper. Ellen was very funny when she complimented his maturity at 16 and he said he was now 17 and
she said forget it, she's not impressed any more. Simon and Kara both picked up on comments of hersduring the night and Simon complimented her Luther Vandross reference. Ellen is still a bit vague at
times, but she's casually funny (even when the lines are prepared) and finally relaxed into the
cheerleading sort of judge we expected from the beginning.
SIOBHAN MAGNUS  -- Sang "Any Man Of Mine," Twain's first #1 country hit in the US and a template
for Gretchen Wilson and many others. I spent the night just listening to the performances and then
rewinding and playing it again while watching the visuals as well. With just the audio, Siobhan was farand away the worst of the night. She was running out of breath throughout the tune and just sort of
getting through the words. The only purpose of the performance was the finale, where she brought out
her patented yowlp and wowed 'em all. To be honest, it may have been the only good moment of the songbut it was very effective and actually worked perfectly with the tune, as opposed to other times when it
felt like more of a stunt. Since she's never been in the bottom three and gave the people exactly what they
want, I assume she'll be safe again.
My personal bottom three would be Lee, Crystal and Siobhan (with Michael right in there) and Siobhan

for granted. But while I usually just choose the three weakest performances, I doubt it will pan out that
way this week. I'm gonna say Lee Dewyze, Michael Lynche and Aaron Kelly in the bottom three, withMichael Lynche going home. Who did you like or dislike last night? And what did you think of Shania asa mentor?

This is the first season our family ever watched. Siobhan was our favorite from early on, although
we all agreed her performanc es, song choices, etc., had been weak lately. I figured she would make
it to the top 3, together with Aretha Joplin and Lee. Siobhan had raw talent and a unique charm thatwould (will?) probably convert well into pop-stardo m.
Aretha Joplin is far and away the most talented musician/p erformer and ought to win. No one is
really cloe to her. But since it is up to teenage voters, who knows?
Just not that bleating Casey ok? Or Aaron. Come on for kreist's sake...
P. S. Siobhan at this moment is number 3 on Yahoo's Trending Now list. 
And I think she had good answers in today's EW.com interview: http://pop watch.ew.c om/2010/04
/29/siobha n-magnus-e xit-interv iew/
Well, the competitio n is really on now. Siobhan is the first one sent home of those who might have
actually won it. She was a long shot because she grates on many, but still I thought she had achance. I think Lilly, Katelyn, and Lacey all should have lasted longer. Lacey had just started to

32 Fansshow her potential when she was sent home. But none of them was going to win it. 
And I stand by my prediction that, with a good voice coach and a music pro to manage her, Siobhan
could have a very successful career, maybe in the top five of Idol contestant s so far. (I'm not saying
she's in the top five of the best contestant s so far, just that she could be in top five of career
success, thanks to her quirkiness , stage presence, and raw potential. )
Now it comes down to the whims of the voters, not necessaril y the talent or performanc es week to
week.
Siobhan was my favorite, too bad they had such a terrible stylist for her. Sometimes I thought they
were trying to turn her into Debbie Gibson or Tiffany. She was best early on with "Paint it Black"
and "Wicked Game." I look forward to hearing more from her in the future. Now, please let's get ridof that little Aaron twit ASAP.
I was talking with a coworker the other and we both came to the conclusion that we like Siobhan
because she really does have some talent, she just has really bad taste in interpreta tion. If she had
to choose between the more appropriat e for a given song or one that was show-offy, she'd pick the
later every time. Not so sad to see her go. She'll might be a force one day though.
Personally , I thought judges had it all backwards this week. I'm not a fan of Michael but he has
excellent control and it really showed this week. I loved it.Same thing with Crystal, she chose a song that was very simple and she gets blasted for it, even
though it was very well performed. People don't realize the amount of talent you have to have to
make it look as simple as she makes it. Not a fan of the song she sang, but excellent job.
Strong week all around though, but I really believe the judges are trying to influence the voters by
making stuff up. Not like it matters with Aaron now getting 95% of the teenyboppe r votes now that
Tim's peaced.
Incredibly thrilled to see the Screamer hit the road this week. She should have been gone weeks
ago. Just not a fan of the phony scream. Never has worked for her. She thought all along that bydoing an Adam Lambert replay each week that it would set her apart from the crowd and she wouldmove right into the top or second spot. So glad others got as irritated as I did by her. Seems like anice kid, but wow, I would never buy a CD.
I don't know what some people are hearing, but I am really frustrated with Lee. He is off pitch far
too much at this stage of the competitio n. He also has very little performanc e value. The guy doesn't
connect emotionall y with his songs and doesn't have any expression on his face. 
Crystal did have an off week for her, but I supposed that was expected. I don't know what wasgoing on with the backup singer, but it was very distractin g. I agree that she should have smiled
and nodded when the judges were telling her quite nicely that it wasn't their favorite performanc e. 
Mike has the best pure voice of the men. He has excellent vocal technical skills, but this week andlast week for some reason, he hasn't sounded as sharp as he usually does. He managed tocompensate for it with the depth of his emotional commitment to the words of the song. 
I love Siobhan. I make no apologies. I love her quirkiness , how different she sounds, her risky
performanc es, always pushing herself so hard. Her lower register sounds kind of muddy, but thatFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

177 Fanscan easily be corrected with some vocal technical skill. Her range is amazing and her power and
clarity in her head voice is unbelievab le. She is raw talent, a diamond in the rough. We used to
celebrate great voices that were unique, somewhat strange or unusual, now we shrink from them asthough it was the plague.
With fans like you, Siobhan will be fine and perhaps added to the list of Idol contestant s
who had a career afterwards and left the show too soon.
Another one bites the dust. So much for all the season start raves about this being a girls' season.One left. She will probably win, too, but the rest of them fell by the wayside pretty fast. This is stillour least favorite season and the weakest season, jmho. Really not feeling it at all. It's the firstseason I've sat there, jiggling my knee, driving my husband bananas, looking at my watch or theclock constantly and missing stuff because I'm daydreamin g about other stuff I'd rather be doing.
Once Simon's gone, nothing's going to be able to hold me in front of the TV for an entire hour ofthis stuff.
Except, perhaps, The X Factor in the fall of 2011 with Simon in charge? :)
Hehe.. Yeah. Definitely looking forward to that. XF UK is, jmho, a much betterformat and a more interestin g, entertaini ng program. I just hope they keep it pretty
much in tact in the translatio n to the U.S. market.
I won't have to set aside Tuesday and Wednesday nights anymore. I am so done with Idol. The onlycontestant with any originalit y is gone now. Even Crystal is not wowing me. 
Maybe I will go on my Netflix account and upgrade to 3 at a time.
part 1.
I've never liked Lee. But the judges like him and keep pimping him. As they do with Big Mike.
Tonight, however, Simon made his subtle "You're too Gay to be a star" criticism that he used to usewith Clay, but never did with Adam. With Clay it was, "You're too Broadway." With Mike it was,"You're too Wet." Unfortunat ely for Simon, no one knew what he meant by "wet" and he had to be a
bit more blunt and say it meant "Girly." Mike presents as the straight Dad, but his falsetto andsomething else makes a lot of folk think he's in the closet. Being Gay or being suspected of beingGay kept both Clay and Adam from winning. I loved Clay and Adam, however, and I don't really likeMike as a performer. Oh Well.Permalink  | Share it

52 FansI thought Crystal was good, actually. I think she used her back up singer and it worked, rather than
some other people's performanc es this year where the back up singers drowned them out. I also
like that she actually did a country performanc e of a country song, and I thought the vibe with the
Double Bass and the steel guitar was great. I didn't hear her being arrogant, I just heard herexplaining why she went with something smaller after being told she should stick to the big sound.
cont.
part 2.I used to like Siobhan. I'm tired of her. Last night was dreadful. But she won't go soon. 
I love Casey, next to Crystal he's my favorite, but I'm afraid this is his night to go off. ::big
frown:: I think the judges unfair (IMHO) crticism of him the last few weeks has hurt him. I’mnot sure their praise this week will undo that.
I think the other two bottom three should be Mike and Aaron, the only other ones to have
been in the bottom before. I'm hoping it's actually Aaron. I'm sorry, I find him annoying. Hecan sing well, but I have no desire to hear him sing. Maybe he should join "Up WithPeople." Hope I'm wrong about Casey.
Thx for commenting . I didn't think Crystal was arrogant either. I just felt after
months of endless praise, when she finally got some modest "not your best's" thatshe should have just accepted it and say she'd do better next time if given thechance. Just image-wise not the best move but far from disastrous .
Say whaaa? I don't see the slightest indication that Michael Lynch is gay, falsetto or nofalsetto. Anyone who says that either has gayness on the brain to the point of paranoia orought to come out of the closet themselves . Are you repeating or insinuatin g?
Doesn't matter. You were wrong about Casey AND Siobhan, so... so much for that.JMHO.
I'm repeating what others have commented about Mike's singing style. I'm prettysure that is what Simon was insinuatin g. I don't see any reason to doubt Mike's self
identifica tion. But a few people do and Simon seems to be using that as a critique.
What else does "girly" mean? He also attacked Ryan again with his insinuatio ns
tonight.
I'm really glad I was wrong about Casey and Siobhan tonight, by the way.

I think you were pretty much dead on, Michael. But you didn't give Casey enough credit for coming
back strong. Although not the most talented of the bunch, he has all the ingredient s to be a star.
And he sang really well last night. 
Aaron brought it back to his voice last night; he's lost on stage but when he sits and lets the
camera come close while he sings his heart out, he's at his best. 
I wondered as I was listening to Crystal if it was just me or was she not all that good? I thought the
judges were on target, maybe even too kind to her. And like others here, I kept being distracted bythe back up singer. Not that she was bad; she was good, but she took my attention away fromCrystal. 
I still think Siobhan is better than some here give her credit for. And she came back to her strength,
belting it out. She's way more of a performer than the others. But I understand what's been saidabout her and why some don't like her. Tomato ... to mah to. PC ... Mac. I'm a Mac and I like her. 
I'm guessing it's Michael's time again to finish last. But whatever, Shania ought to be a permanent judge mentor, performer. She's not just beautiful,
she's just got it all.
I played back Casey again and he was better than I gave him credit for. Maybe it was mybeing unfamiliar with the song that threw me off. He definitely got lost a bit but I believedearly on it would be him and Crystal till Lee and then Aaron turned my head but I wouldn'tbe at all surprised if my first instinct proved right.
I agree with pretty much everything you said, Don, about Casey and Aaron. I think Casey
could have a very good career if he shows us more of what he showed us with that
performanc e of "Don't". As for Aaron, he did it again - sounded awesomely good in his
session with Shania and then didn't even come close in the actual live performanc e.
Nerves, maybe? Youth and inexperien ce? He seems to lose all confidence .
Disagree with you on Siobhan. She fooled us for quite a few weeks with those belt-outs.
We finally tumbled to the reality a few weeks ago (Beatles Week, I'm thinking) which is that,unless she's blasting away at full volume, she has a pretty average voice when she'ssinging within the normal ranges. She has a lot of range and power on the upper end, butnothing special in the underpinni ngs. Wouldn't buy the album.
Beatles' week was one of my favorite Siobhan performanc es! I've listened to the
studio track of "Across the Universe" over and over again and I adore it.Something in her voice resonates with me, and I always felt she sang with honesty
and sincerity. In fact, she was one of the few AI contestant s who seemed to listen
and understand the words she was singing, imo. You don't have to buy her album,
but I can't wait for the opportunit y to hear more from her... I haven't been this
excited about a new artist in years and years. I'd rather poke sticks in my earsthan listen to [insert names of a dozen popular artists here], but I'm happy theyhave fans who enjoy what they're hearing.
Well. Considerin g our little back and forth last time...Permalink  | Share it

We're in agreement for the most part. I think Aaron simply has to go now. He's totally
outmatched . And, frankly, after Aaron -- Mike should be the next to go. His range is utterly
limited. He'll have a lovely career IN his range, but for Idol? He's done.
So the top 3 should be Lee, Casey and Crystal, and they should go in that order. Tuesday
Casey came back in a HUGE way -- that performanc e was truly game changing for him.
Excellent choices. I'm stunned he was in the bottom two -- but then, when the decision isleft the callers, and they're teeny boppers and evangelica ls? Small wonder Aaron has
lasted as long as he has. It's the weakest element of this show, the hinging on the PUBLIC
to choose the winners of a talent competitio n. Pity.
You KEEP hanging on to Siobhan... Sigh. Raw talent is NOT enough. Put her in an
intensive program, with a vocal coach AND a physical coach (god, her physicalawkwardnes s while moving and singing -- painful to watch) AND an acting teacher to go
along with it (ZERO connnectio n to those songs, just ZILCH in the eyes)... and MAYBE.
But... ugh. I know. I'm harping and the poor girl is gone. I'll let it go.
(To be continued in the next comment -- I went over the word count)
Agreed. On everything you say, until the Siobhan paragraph. And I'm not saying
she's the greatest talent out there. I'm just saying in America as it is today, she'llhave a very successful career. Do I have to list examples of the tons of singerswho have small talent but something that connects with people? And it certainlydoesn't have to be the majority of people. If one percent of America loves you, youhave 30 million fans and you're set for life.
I think a lot of the stars that have performed on the eliminatio n shows aren't any
better than the top five in the competitio n most years. They just have connection s
and production s and whatever. 
As for your order of eliminatio n of the final five, I believe you have it exactly right.
Unless something big changes. I do have doubts about whether Crystal will
actually win it, however. Does she appeal to teeny boppers or evangelica ls? Does
she have any bloc supporting her, other than people who love great singing? Willthat be enough?
Has anyone done any in-depth polling or analysis of who votes each week. I know
there's a lot of discussion of the tweeners, evangelica ls, etc. But I'd be interested
to know more about demographi c breakdowns . Which groups vote once? How
many people vote multiple times? What percentage votes 10, 20, 30+ times forone person? Do some vote 10 times for one, 20 times for another? ETC.

Siobhan was one of the few AI contestant s over 9 seasons who I really identified
with, and I never saw her as anything other than comfortabl e in her own skin and
blessed with a charming personalit y. What you saw as zero connection and
awkwardnes s wasn't what I saw, at all. Your interpreta tion of Siobhan isn't wrong,
but mine isn't wrong either -- we just like and appreciate different things, and Ithink we probably make interpreta tions based on our own life-exper iences. The
only previous contestant on AI who I liked as much as Siobhan was CarlySmithson, who was another really polarizing performer, but also one with adedicated fan base.
Anyone know if iTunes will release sales figures for the AI studio tracks when the
season is over?

43 FansTime to hammer on Aaron until he's euthanised . (Of course, the mercy's for ME...)
: )
I'm really happy about Casey making it at least SOMETHING of a competitio n with "Don't."
That was a happy surprise. Now, if he comes back with yet another rockin' electric same
ole-- game over. It's Lee and Crystal in the final two and Crystal takes it in a rout. But if
Casey doesn't let this bottom two thing get to him, and realises he really hit somethingspecial, keeps stretching -- not NECESSARIL Y with more ballads -- a mistake Aaron
INSISTS on making, one I simply LOATHE seeing and hearing (that type of earnest, faux-since re, in love with himself, probably latent, just wait, any daywe'll hear an Archuleta
announceme nt).
Pffffft. All this sturm und drang -- we all know if Crystal DOESN'T win it will be a travesty ofAdam Lambertian proportion s. Worse, because at least Adam lost to someone who was
halfway decent competitio n. NO ONE else is in her league this season. Casey and Lee are
good -- but nowhere near her league.
And by the way -- I disagree with EVERYONE about her performanc e, and I totally got
what she was saying; she WANTED to change it up, to make it a smaller, quieter
performanc e. She doesn't NEED to blow us out of the water every single time; we all
KNOW she can do that; she wanted to go in another direction. She has the range -- andshe has earned
And speaking of Kris Allen, those car commercial s with him are terrible. He can
barely talk, and it's so nasally. Ouch. He can sing fairly well, but I agree he was nomatch for the multi-tale nted Adam. That guy's a force. Even when he missed notes
or wasn't his best, he was far and away the best all around performer ever on Idol.
Here's my thought about Crystal this week: if she wanted to do a smaller, quieter
performanc e, why have all the musicians around her and why let the backup singer
take away from her singing? Why not just stand out there by herself and sing herquieter song?
So, yes it will be a travesty if Crystal doesn't win it. But as I said above (or
wherever your first comment is), she might not have the voting blocs, like Adamdidn't in the final week. If it's Casey in the finals with her he might win theremaining tweeners and evangelica ls, even though he hasn't played to either of
them. He just doesn't have much of anything to dislike at this stage. But I fear
some won't like Crystal because of piercings or whatever. 
P. S. What are you and I going to have left to disagree on, now that we agree on
the exact order of the final five? Let’s be sure and find something.

I agree that Chrystal felt a bit off last night, but I also still liked it. I thought Lee was great!! I like theway he sounds. Sioban was absolutely horrific and I couldn't believe the praise they all laid on her.Plus, I haven't been much of a Casey fan to this point but last night he was just great. I reallywouldn't mind if Aaron or Sioban or even Big Mike go home. Guess we'll see!
Even when Crystal has a somewhat off week, she's still miles ahead of everyone else.
My taste test is always which song I could stand to listen to again, and even this week, Crystal isHUFFPOST SUPER USER

Chrystal, Michael and Sioban were amazing as usual.They are consistent ly better than the others. I
believe the judges hold them up to a different bar than the others.
I can't even believe just how bored I am with Idol this season. I am more interested in ANY of the
reality show results above Idol, Project RUnway, Top Chef, even RuPauls Drag Race. The show isjust so tepid, the juging is boring, and the one judge who says anything on point, has two problems,he has checked out and he keeps getting cut off for time while Randy and Kara are allowed toramble on and on.
Totally agree. I never thought Kara could make me miss Paula, but it is happening. Randyis nothing more than dawg this and dawg that, and 'it just didn't work for me, dawg". AndEllen is so uninspired all she can muster is "It wasn't your best performanc e". This just in,
Ellen. There's only ONE "best" performanc e by any of them, so if that's the standard, it's
gonna be a long season.
And BTW, as someone who enjoys "Glee" a helluva lot more than "Idol", it would be nice if
"Idol" could get off the air in its prescribed time so you could Tivo "Glee" without missingthe last few minutes every week because "Idol" ran long, usually because Ryan wasblabbing incessantl y about something unimportan t. Only "Idol" can make the latest
technology totally obsolete.
I always DVR Idol plus 1 1/2 hours of running over. That covers Glee and half anhour of Idol overspill AND if someone is singing during the hour cross over, itdoesn't stop at nine and force you to start a new program. It's all one taping anduninterrup ted.
