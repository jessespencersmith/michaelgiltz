THE new season of "Chap­
pelle's Show" -the hot­
test sketch comedy series 
on television and a record-set­
ting bestseller on DVD -has 
been pushed back months from 
Feb. 16 to late April or May. 
Uiness and a "Sopranos"-like 
display of artistic control are to 
blame, officials say. Dave Chap­
pelle is under the weather with 
the flu and borderline walking 
pneumonia, according to Tony 
Fox, the executive vice presi­
dent of corporate communica­
tions at Comedy Central. 
As well, Chappelle is not 
sticking to a predictable time­
table for delivering new epi­
sodes of the show, famous for 
parodying Rick James ("I'm 
Rick James, b--!") and ex­
ploring issues of race and class 
with scathing humor. 
"Dave- and his entire pro­
duction crew for that matter -
got a bit of a late start on writ­
ing season three," says Fox. 
"We're behind on the writing. 
He was recently sick for more 
than a week. There had been a 
built-in hiatus in the produc­
tion schedule for the holidays. 
"We had about 10 days of pro­
duction left, so we pushed that 
through the end of the holiday 
break to give him some time to 
recover and get some writing 
time in. We'll resume produc­
tion in January, so we're not ex­
actly sure what that means in 
terms of launch date." 
The first season debuted in January of 2003 and quickly be­
came the cable channel's hot­
test property alongside" The 
Daily Show With Jon Stew­
art" and "South Park." 
Season two debuted in Janu­
ary of this year and turned into 
a genuine phenomenon. 
It regularly drew more than 3 
million viewers, and the DVD 
set of season one came out a 
month later, quickly becoming 
the top-selling TV show on 
DVD of all time (though "Seio­
feld" is expected to surpass it 
this season). 
Chappelle toyed with ending 
the show on a high note. 
But he eventually re-signed 
With Comedy Central in a prec­
edent-setting deal that paid him 
to continue as star, executive 
producer and writer of the se­
ries and gave him a piece of the 
DVD profits (something even 
movie stars don't typically get). 
The two-year deal for 26 
shows could be worth some $50 
million, depending on sales. 
The DVD set of season two 
has also been delayed to tie-in 
with the TV launch of season 
three. 
"We're still talking to Dave 
and his team, seeing where we 
are in the writing," says Fox .. 
"Bottom line: We're behind. If! 
had to guess, I'd say April or 
May at the earliest. No later 
than May." 
Along with the show, Chap­
pelle has been working on 
other projects,including a 
feature film along the lines of 
1973's "Wattstax," which fea­
tured legendary stand-up by 
Richard Pryor. 
The untitled film -di-rected by Michel Gondry 
of "Eternal Sunshine of 
the Spotless Mind" -
combines Chap­
pelle's sketch com­
edy with a Brooklyn 
"block party" con­
cert filmed in Sep­
tember and featur­
ing musical guests 
like Mos Def (a fre­
quent guest on the 
show), Kanye 
West, Common, 
Erykah Badu and 
a reunited Fugees. 
There is no re­
lease date for the 
film. 
Chappelle's 
$500,000 book 
deal with Disney­
owned Hyperion 
also appears to 
be in flux.</p>
