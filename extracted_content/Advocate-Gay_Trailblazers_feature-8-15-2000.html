"Unfortunately for many 
gay people, there really 
was no one/'says painter 
RossSleckner. "Gay men 
from previous generations 
never thought of it as their 
responsibility to create 
role models of themselves 
to make il easier for 
younger gay people, 
"The historical figures 
who were known to be gay 
weren't much comfort ei· 
Iher. You couldn't glean 
who Ihey were as political 
and social entities through 
theirsexuality ,ltwashlnt· 
ed ai, but you had to read 
between the lines. And 
reading belween Ihe lines 
is discouraging. Thai's the 
social model most gay peo· 
pie had 10 deal with. Hope· 
fully, the generation Ihat is 
eslablished now will feel 
Ihe responsibilily 10 be out 
so lhat younger gay people 
don'l have 10 do Ihat any· 
more,"-M.G.

'The directors lohn Waters 
and Gus Van Sant have been 
really important tome," 
says designer and director 
Todd Oldham, who's work· 
ing on a script he plans 10 
shoot next year. "I saw 
(Waters'sl Female Trouble 
in a movie theater in Dallas, 
and my jaw was on my lap 
the entire time. It inspired 
the first five years of my 
design career, And Van 
Sanl's Mala Nocheis so 
beautiful,sopretty -it'sa 
fairy tale broughl to life, in 
an intriguing way." Oldham 
particularly admires how 
bothdireclors lackle gay 
subject matter without 
being boxed Inbyi!. "The 
gay parts are just includ· 
ed," says Oldham. "The 
movies are never defined
