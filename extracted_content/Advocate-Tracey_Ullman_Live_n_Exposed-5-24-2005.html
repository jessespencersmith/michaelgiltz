efore she W'.l'3 a fabulous comedy 
chameleon, Tracey Ullman was a 
teen dancer toming with a gaggle 
of chorus boys. In her variety

Tile SimpsolI.» ancl HBO's Tracey Takes 
On ... , Ullman has "become" a gay male

dads. This year lJilimlll is teaming with Carol 
Burnett in a new TV version of Once Upon a 
Mu,ltress. And on May 14 H130 presents 
Tracey Ullman: Liur; & Erposecl, a smash­
ing stand-np show timt tells the whole st011' 
oflJlh11an's perfonnin g life. -Michael Gillz 
Live & Exposed makes jI: dear you 
missed periorming to ail audience. 
Goel bless BBO for letting me do this, letting 
me reenact stufffi·Olll when I was G. It made 
1\lE' realize I've always done ba'3ically what I 
did on my mother's \ indowsilL You got a big dose of "gay" back ill 
your dancing days. 
Did I say t.he word "gay" enough in the 
show? Gay, gay, gay' [7'rilling] That was the 
dmlce world. I had so much 11m getting out 
of my house and going to Berlin when I was 
16. 'n1ey were a big family, and they all took 
care of me. It was an astonishin g time. 
Berlin was amazing, decadent, and fun. It 
was an oasis then. \'ow it's honible. 
Any chance you'll tour with Ulis'! lUte 
lena Home: The Lady and Her Music? 
If I did wallt to do a short run onstage, 
there's so much more I could put in, like my 
experiences with Meryl Streep. [Oul (~f

gay channel"? 
There's one in Canada. 
I know, I saw it. Why don't we have that 
here? It's going to happen. You've got the 
Korean channel and the Hindu charmeL TIiere's om.'! gay person you still hold f,\ 
grudge against-the theater director 
who YGU thought p!t1inted to you at an 
mnHtion wiHm you were a teen. He said: 
"Nor 110, no, flO, !lo!" He wanted the 
blond gin next to you. 
I'Ullever forget the hlUniJiation, you honible 
'70s English queen with yom clipboard and 
your bugly stuffed ~illy' I always remem\)('r 
those guys-they used to call each other 
Gladys and Daisy. That was when they did 
gay talk No one does that anymore because 
you don't hav to. 
it seems alrllost evei)' decade YOli give 
us a variety show. We're about due for 
another one, aren't we? 
I guess so. I'm a bit more ready for an An· 
gela Lansbury Mm'del', She Wrote-type 
sedentary sClies. She'd pop in at the begin·
