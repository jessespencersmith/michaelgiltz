 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyNew York Film Festival Embraces
"Carnage"
The 49th New York Film Festival  kicks off with Roman
Polanski's Carnage . It's an ideal Opening Night movie:
the film contains stars for the red carpet (Jodie Foster,
Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly), it'sfun and light but with a patina of seriousness to reassure
the audience that it's "art."
The festival itself is especially civilized. As a critic, you
feel none of the tension and pressure at NYFF  that you
might at other, larger festivals. In a way, it's a film
festival for people who can't go to film festivals. Theycherry pick movies that have appeared at other fests
around the world and offer them to savvy New Yorkers,
the very audience that would seek out these movies at
independent cinemas if and when they got a theatrical run (as many of the films here do). It's a relaxed,
ideal way to end the festival circuit. And for movie buffs, it's a good way to check the pulse of world
cinema.
CARNAGE  ** 1/2 out of ****
Playwright Yazmina Reza specializes in boulevard comedies -- well-constructed plays with small casts and
strong roles that appeal to top actors. Her most successful works are Art  (a clever piece in which three
friends bicker over one of their purchases in modern art) and now Gods Of Carnage, shortened for film
to just Carnage . They're easy to over-praise and just as easy to under-praise. The glimmers of debate
about deep and meaningful topics -- What is art? How do you raise children? How close are we to chaos?
The importance of language -- annoy those who see her works as just slightly above sitcom level. But

<p>dismissing them as empty pfiffle ignores their genuinely solid structures and strong characters that
invariably bring in top actors.
Carnage  is no different. Two couples meet one afternoon to negotiate a "truce" over their sons, one of
whom struck the other with a stick, knocking out teeth. The parents try to be polite, but as they dance
around awkward differences in sensibility and parenting, the afternoon becomes tenser and tenser untiltensions explode.
Jodie Foster is good as the tightly wound mother and writer who bristles at every comment of the
rapacious lawyer Christoph Waltz. He's a lawyer constantly interrupting the conversation to carry on legaladvice with a pharmaceutical company about bad fallout over a drug with disastrous side effects.
Needless to say, the uber liberal Foster is horrified. Reilly is her working man husband (though they
certainly have a very nice apartment) and Winslet is Waltz's put-upon wife with her own successfulcareer that makes Foster and Reilly either green with jealousy or suspicious over privilege.
It's a note for note reproduction of the play, with unnecessary bookends set in a park. Actually seeing the
fight between the boys and then the coda back at the park is a very bad idea that softens the real impact
of the play, which is to let our imagination fill in what might have happened and watch adults descend
into brutality. This is NOT about the boys and their fight so beginning and ending with them (not tomention a lame visual gag) throws the movie off.
Otherwise, Polanski nimbly keeps the action flowing with an active camera that avoids the feeling of a
play captured on film. That apartment (the story essentially takes place over 80 minutes in one location)doesn't feel as claustrophobic as it might. Still, there's a certain lessening of dramatic impact without
actually being trapped in that space with the couples in a live performance. The stage set managed to be
more abstract, allowing Carnage  to revel more completely in the social breakdown when the couples get
out of control. That's lost a bit on film, but it's still easy entertainment with four actors having a balldigging into the lines of Reza that can definitely amuse. You'll forget it an hour after seeing it, but light
entertainment and solid performances are all too rare in the theater or at the movies.
