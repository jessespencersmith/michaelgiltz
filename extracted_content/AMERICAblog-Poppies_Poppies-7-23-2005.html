7/23/2005 03:31:00 PMNo, I'm not quoting "The Wizard of Oz," I'm referring to anintriguing op-ed in the NYT. It suggests that one way to dealwith the heroin trade dominating Afghanistan is to encourageit. The writer points out the worldwide shortage of pain killers,posits the legal and regulated growth of poppies in Afghanistanto meet that need. Since it's virtually the only source of incomefor the entire nation, this plan would be one way to givefarmers a far more compelling choice: the drug lords with theirevil ways or dealing with the government buying poppies at acompetitive price for use as medicine."...even if we paid exactly what the drug lords do, theentire crop would cost only about $600 million - less thanthe $780 million the United States planned to spend oneradication in Afghanistan this year."Besides, eradication efforts have never eliminated a drugcrop. Cocaine continues to be widely available, despite theroughly $3 billion that the United States has spent on cocaeradication in Colombia over the last five years. And that isonly the most recent example."India's thriving generic drug industry suggests that thereis plenty of money to be made in the marketing of genericpain relievers. But even if returns are modest, generatingany profit at all is better than stamping out the major driverof an unstable country's economy. Legal products are alsosafer and easier to regulate than illegal drugs...."But think of it this way: what's an easier sell with farmers,hard cash now or pesticide spraying and potentially emptypromises of economic assistance? Few Afghans begrudgefarmers' efforts to feed their families - but many would turnagainst greedy planters who continued supplying drug lordsdespite adequate alternatives."
