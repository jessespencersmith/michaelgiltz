            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  M A R C H  0 1 ,  2 0 0 73-D Spreading To Concerts And VideosThe NYTimes has a piece on 3-D being used in music videos by thelikes of Gwen Stefani. Fine. But it's odd for them to say that directorJames Cameron was an "unlikely source" for the suggestion thatStefani employ 3-D. In fact, Cameron may be the likeliest source in theworld for such an idea -- he's been touting 3-D for years as the wave ofthe future for movies and a way to make the theater-going experiencespecial. He's been pushing the technology, urging others to get involvedand insisted he was going to wait to make his next film until the 3-Deffects were cool enough. And of course Cameron has been working onthat massively budgeted sci-fi spectacle "Avatar" for a while now. Itwould only be odd if Cameron told someone NOT to use 3-D, thoughpresumably there are quiet domestic dramas he might think wereill-suited to such an approach. But then again, you never know.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
