9/07/2004 06:44:00 PMThe military honcho who imported the abusive, shameful rape,torture and beating-to-death treatment of prisoners fromGuantanamo Bay to Iraq -- Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller -- now admitsthat treating prisoners doesn't just comply with international law, USmilitary law, and the standards of decency that all Americans expect.It actually WORKS BETTER too.Miller should be in disgrace and out of uniform, but at least he canadmit when he's wrong, unlike Bush. By the way, I wouldn'tcharacterize this approach as "gentler." They're simply the minimalstandards for any humane society that has a prisoner under itscontrol.
