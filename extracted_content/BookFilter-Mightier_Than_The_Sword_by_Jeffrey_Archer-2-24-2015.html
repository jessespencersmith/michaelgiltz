Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThe fifth -- but NOT final -- volume in Jeffrey Archer's hugely popular Clifton Chronicles will keep the faithfulturning pages frantically. Someone will turn this into a TV series: one season of 10 or 12 episodes per bookshould do the trick. Badgered by family who were devouring them, I barreled through books one and four inanticipation of this new installment. Book One was shamefully entertaining, a soap of the highest order. BookTwo, perhaps slightly less so? Book Three showed more wear and tear in the increasingly complicated plotting.Then Book Four and now this hit significant lows. Even by the standards of "it's all just silly fun," the plotting hasbecome rather ludicrous, with one jaunt into the heart of the Soviet Union by one of the world's most ardentcritics of that government particularly boneheaded. Oh, I'll keep reading just to see how the damn thing turnsout, but what once seemed to be a possible crowning achievement for Archer now feels slapdash. I imagine hedidn't expect the massive appeal this series would have and his unflagging imagination in fact began to flag ashe wondered how to keep things moving along. A pity. -- Michael GiltzWhat Others Say"One of the top ten storytellers in the world."—Los Angeles Times"Archer is a master entertainer."—Time Magazine"There isn't a better story-teller alive."—Larry King"A storyteller in the class of Alexander Dumas…Unsurpassed skill…making the reader wonder intensely what willhappen next."—The Washington PostWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
