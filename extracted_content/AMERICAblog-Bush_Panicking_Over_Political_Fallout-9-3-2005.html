9/03/2005 08:45:00 PMBush stayed on vacation for days after the hurricane struck --as did vice president Cheney and Condi Rice (who BEGAN hervacation after the worst natural disaster in our nation's historybattered her home state of Alabama). Bush went on politicaljaunts, took more than two days to address the country andgoofed around while the waters were rising and people weredying. When he finally toured the destruction, Bush jokedaround in New Orleans about his younger days of hardpartying. (Can anyone doubt Cindy Sheehan now? I wasn'tsure what to think when she said Bush acted like he was at aparty when he was supposed to be comforting grievingfamilies? I thought, "Really?" But now we've seen Bush do thevery same thing ON NATIONAL TV.)But now, now that his POLITICAL life is in danger, Bush ispanicking.As Mr. Bush spoke, Vice President Dick Cheney and KarlRove, the president's senior political adviser, listened on thesidelines, as did Dan Bartlett, the counselor to the presidentand Mr. Bush's overseer of communications strategy. Theirpresence underscored how seriously the White Houseis reacting to the political crisis it faces.That's right. People have died because of Bush's dereliction of duty,his complete indifference to human suffering. But what does he dowhen disaster strikes? He calls in political hacks under investigationfor endangering national security and image doctors to repair thePOLITICAL damage. Because that's clearly all that Bush cares about.If it isn't, why did Bush stay on vacation for days while people weredying? Why did vice president Cheney stay on vacation for some SIXDAYS after the hurricane battered this country? Why did Sec. of StateCondi Rice LEAVE for vacation while New Orleans was spiraling intodespair and go to a fancy Broadway show (tickets cost $100 for theconnected and powerful people who can score them), play tennis withMonica Seles and buy obscenely expensive shoes on Fifth Avenue?Why did Sec. of Defense Donald Rumsfeld go on a political jaunt withBush to California on Tuesday instead of getting ready to send in thetroops? Kanye West was partly right when he said Bush doesn't careabout black people: Bush doesn't care about anybody but himself.
