8/09/2004 05:51:00 PMEven the head of Iraqi tourism suggests now might not be the besttime to visit beautiful downtown Baghdad."We don't want good people from all over the world to come and becaptured by criminals. I think they must wait," he said (ratherjudiciously).But despite all the arguments over why and when Iraq was invaded,it's great to see local Iraqis beginning to get pissed at the bomberswho are now, of course, attacking Iraqi civilians. God willing, thehead of tourism will actually have a thriving position ten years fromnow, since if Iraq becomes a stable democracy (something we allshould hope and pray and work towards) then every Middle Easternerwill want to visit and then, oh, maybe forget to catch that flight backto Saudi Arabia/Iran/you-name-it.
