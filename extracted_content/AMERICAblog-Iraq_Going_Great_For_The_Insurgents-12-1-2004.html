12/01/2004 11:27:00 AMYesterday, the New York Times ran an article about how poorlythe training of Iraqi forces is going and how weak their conductin battle. This isn't an attack on the Iraqi men themselves --anyone signing up for training as a soldier or cop wheninsurgents are attacking their families and suicide-bombinglines of workers is brave in my book.But a number of depressing points popped up: many of themlie to their families about their jobs and not just for security --some of them are embarrassed. But if Iraqis have to lie aboutdefending their own country from suicide bombers, we aredefinitely losing the battle for hearts and minds.One US soldier said a sign of improvement would be if Iraqisoldiers simply showed up for anything other than payday.But here's the little noted kicker:"Given the weak performance of Iraqi forces, any majorwithdrawal of American troops FOR AT LEAST A DECADEwould invite chaos, a senior Interior Ministry official, whosename could not be used, said in an interview last week."Excuse me, but shouldn't that have been the headline? Bush'soriginal plan to pull out most troops after three months hasnow switched to keeping them there until 2014 -- AT THEEARLIEST. Can you say quagmire?
