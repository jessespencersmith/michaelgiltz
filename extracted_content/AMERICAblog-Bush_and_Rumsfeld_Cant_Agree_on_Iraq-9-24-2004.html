9/24/2004 02:31:00 AMSo Ayad Allawi -- the US-appointed head of Iraq (let's not dignify himyet with the title of Prime Minister, as if he was anything other than aCIA-paid figurehead Bush signed off on) -- anyway, Allawi insists theIraqi elections are gonna happen in January. Allawi concedes they"may not be perfect." Bush blithely dismisses the "persistentviolence" as nothing to worry about.But Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld acknowledges the obviousfact that if the US can't even enter major cities in Iraq without riskinglife and limb, they can hardly oversee an election. His even blithercomment?"'Let's say you tried to have an election, and you could have it inthree-quarters or four-fifths of the country, but some places youcouldn't because the violence was too great,' Mr. Rumsfeld said at ahearing on Capitol Hill, according to the New York Times. 'Well, that'sso be it. Nothing's perfect in life.'"How true.
