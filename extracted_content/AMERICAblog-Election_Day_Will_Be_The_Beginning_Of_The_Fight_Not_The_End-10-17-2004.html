10/17/2004 02:35:00 AMThe LA Times agrees with the NYT and what I've been saying forweeks, Cassandra that I am:This election will not be decided on election day. (I'm assuming myquiet dream of a Kerry landslide comes to naught and things reallyare as close as they seem.)"Mounting concerns about voter registration snafus, election machinedefects and other kinds of problems that might contaminate thepresidential election is spurring dozens of U.S. organizations to planextraordinary efforts to scrutinize the polls on Nov. 2," writes the LATimes."More than 25,000 poll watchers, ranging from lawyers to computerexperts, are expected outside and inside precincts to report problemsand in some cases to intervene if they believe poll workers areviolating voter rights or making technical mistakes."Go to voteprotect.org to check out hundreds of voting irregularitiesthis one group is tracking.And face it, when lawyers are involved, lawsuits will be filed and theprocess will become protracted and ugly. But isn't that better thanletting activist judges choose your President for you?
