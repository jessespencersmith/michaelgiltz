ALL  THE  FACES  OF  THE  MOON  * out of ****
PUBLIC  THEATER
My first experience with monologuist Mike Daisey was The  Agony  and  the  Ecstasy  of
Steve  Jobs,  a show I reviewed and was mixed on  even before factual inaccuracies
bedeviled it. But my first job in New York City was as a fact checker and I seemed more
perturbed than others by that controversy. Was the brouhaha clouding my judgment of hiswork's value?
Here was a chance to start fresh. Daisey is doing 29 new monologues created over 29
nights, nominally tracking the phases of the moon and creating a portrait of Daisey andNew York City at this moment in time. It was clear from the start that these were storiesand no expectations that hold for memoirs and truly autobiographical work (ie. that thestories be essentially accurate and true) would apply. Whew. If that wasn't clear, it was
clear at the end of the first night's monologue when Death rode a horse across the waters
lapping Manhattan.
I saw two performances in person and anyone can listen to all of them online. ( The show
continues through October 3  and podcasts of his monologues are posted the next day for
free on his website  and via iTunes .)
One immediate advantage for this show compared to his last is the venue. Joe's Pub is an
intimate space, a speakeasy/cabaret. Steve  Jobs  was performed in a much larger theatrical
venue at the Public and Daisey felt obliged to fill it up vocally. He has a tendency tomelodrama in his delivery, speaking in a very LOUD  voice at one moment and
whispering  the next. Luckily, the smaller space of Joe's Pub tamped down this tendency.
He still did it, but the gestures were more nuanced.
Normally with an event this ambitious and the opportunity to see only a few nights, I'd
feel cheated. Wouldn't you want to see them all? Obviously the impact should be greater ifyou somehow attended a majority or all of the 29 different nights. But the implicitpromise is that even seeing one evening should be satisfying; it should stand on its own.Having attended two nights and listened to a third online, that's far from the case. Daiseyseems like that guest at a dinner party who has nothing of interest to say but won't stoptalking.
On opening night, I hoped or imagined it was due to this being opening night. As Daisey
rambled on in an unfocused, uninteresting manner, I gave it the benefit of the doubt. He'sclearing his throat, setting the stage for 28 nights to come, I thought. But attending a
second show a few days later, my initial impressions were reinforced mightily: he has no
insights beyond the banal and no stories beyond the vaguely personal that don't hold ourinterest or head anywhere.
On opening night, he described getting out of bed late at night, heading to the docks, lying
down on a pier and trailing his hand in the water. Really, I thought, trying to imagineDaisey lolling on a wooden pier? And would the water even at high tide be high enoughfor a hand lazily draped over the side to touch it? This sort of nit-picking is not whatshould occupy your mind. But Daisey had not set a scene or created a story that wasremotely engaging enough to stop my mind from wandering.
In the second show I saw, Daisey centered his tale on a quest of sorts. A chubby, teen-
aged black girl just 15 years old is magically summoned to a powerful woman's presenceMay 13, 2014

<p>and given a task: she must take a message from the Upper East Side and walk all the way
down to Wall Street to a certain location. She must not speak to anyone or drink or eat
anything or kiss anyone either; if she does, the girl will have failed. On her journey, eventsconspire to foil her: people keep asking her questions, a nice woman offers her cookies,accidents take place and authorities ask if she's witnessed them and so on. But the girlheads on her way with resolution.
In typical fashion, Daisey goes off on an uninteresting tangent about a Brazilian woman
who works downtown and takes a camera with her on lunch breaks. It devolves into a
discussion of work visas and how this makes people indentured servants to the companies
that obtain those visas for them. (Social justice is never far below the surface for Daisey;indeed the black girl is plagued by vivid dreams in which she imagines herself working ina brutal factory on the far side of the world, presumably China.) The woman carries hercamera with her on lunch so she still feels in touch with the artist she might have been.This explains in laborious, unrevealing detail why she has a camera with her and takes apicture of the 15-year-old black girl as the teenager rounds the corner towards where thewoman is seated outdoors. The woman takes a series of pictures and then realizes her lenshas just broken. In looking at the pictures she took, the woman notices that the crack onthe lens begins emanating... precisely from the head of the 15 year old black girl! That is
the ominous, symbolic, hoped-for telling detail on which this particular evening ends.
Except it means precisely nothing to us. I kept referring to the protagonist as the 15-year-
old black girl because that's about all we know of her. It's risible not because Daisey choseto make the heroine of this tale a 15-year-old black girl but because she is nothing but  a
symbol. He never brings her to life and so her description is reductive and flat rather thana first step in describing and personalizing who this person is to him and us. She has aCarrie -like ability to mess with technology we witnessed earlier but this too means
nothing. We don't know the girl or the message she's delivering and even the not-knowingisn't interesting, as it might be. Certainly her journey downtown isn't interesting despiteall the obstacles in her path.
Daisey has a few good moments. His biggest laughs come from banal insights delivered
well, such as the observation that New Yorkers always insist the city used to be betterbefore and have always said so (he acknowledges this is a cliche). Another similar moment
comes when he says New Yorkers love to give directions. It's typical stand-up material but
he delivers it with verve and earns the laughs. Similarly, when the second performance Isaw took place on the day of Apple's announcement of new products, he got a lot ofmileage out of his obsession with that company and their products. It was the richest veinbecause it's so specific to him and such untrodden material. He has it all to himself.
But then he'd veer off and describe their interactions with the NSA (lying to consumers
about the data they shared) as anal rape, a violent burst of venom that felt out of whack(and I really have a thing for online privacy too). He repeated the anal rape idea anothernight discussing consumerism and Amazon's Kindle.
Even when he lands on a vivid image or idea, it goes nowhere. The teenage girl sent on
that quest is given her orders by the Grey Lady. This powerful figure -- I pictured NancyMarchand or a steelier Kitty Carlisle Hart -- is the literal embodiment of the New  YorkTimes.  It's a clever idea -- the New  York  Times  as the Grey Lady, ensconced in her
penthouse on the Upper East Side. Her requests are really commands because she's soused to getting her way and so powerful to punish if she does not. But having alighted onthis idea of the Grey Lady, it goes nowhere. Daisey just rambles on about media and thecollapse of newspapers, how the New  York  Times  has had no real rival for decades.
Perfectly reasonable albeit unremarkable observations -- but he might just as easily haverambled on about something else. Not for a moment do we feel in the guiding hand of astoryteller who knows where they're taking us. The Grey Lady has a cough -- I
immediately think of consumption, the go-to disease in old movies -- and I'm pleased
when she coughs into a delicate scarf and she coughs not blood but black ink. I loved theblack ink but...a "delicate scarf?" Why would a rich and powerful figure like the Grey Ladycough into a scarf? A minute later, Daisey referred to her coughing into a rag. This is even</p>
<p>worse. A scarf rather than a linen handkerchief is confusing. But a rag is utterly out of
place. And why has it changed?
This lack of precision in the words he uses is a constant throughout the show. At another
point, when talking about Apple, he says they want us to believe it's a new era at thecompany. But it's not, says Daisey, because Jobs is dead and everything has changed.Well, if everything has changed surely it IS a new era, not in the positive sense they meantit but still.
Again and again I found myself confounded by his choice of words and their seeming
randomness, by tales that set off on tangents and then faded to a stop. I was never
confident of the monologues, never certain of where we were headed or even where'd we
been since the scenes slipped so easily from my memory. All I was certain about was thatMike Daisey was just as confused and unsure as the rest of us.
