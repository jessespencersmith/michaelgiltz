For many of us, our holiday traditions include
things like caroling, parties, opening one gift onChristmas Eve and other perennials done in acertain way probably because our parents andgrandparents did it that way too. But newtraditions arrive: a CD that's always placed onrepeat and often a TV special or movie we watchyet again. You used to have to wait for your localTV station to rerun It's A Wonderful Life  or A
Charlie Brown Christmas.  Now you can catch it
online or buy your own copy on DVD. Somepeople stick to those genuine holiday-themed
shows while others like to roam far and wide by making unlikely titles like Die Hard and Fanny &
Alexander  part of their unconventional holiday must-dos. This column isn't a rundown of all the
classics: it's a collection of the titles that have been repackaged and reissued or put out for the firsttime in the last few months. So here are some old friends and some new ones that hope to jointhem as part of your holiday tradition.
YOU'LL POKE YOUR EYE OUT  -- Like the Jimmy Stewart gem It's A Wonderful Life, the
sweet comedy A Christmas Story  has drilled its way into our holiday memory thanks to marathon
showings on TV. The fact that it's from the director of Porky's  gives this gentle film a racy edge it
otherwise happily avoids. Actually, this modest 1983 hit was made on a shoestring and it shows.
But the narration is so witty and the cast led by Peter Billingsley so spot-on it doesn't matter. Thebb gun, the visit to Santa at the mall, the scandalous table lamp, the bunny pajamas -- they can'thelp but make you smile. This Ultimate Collector's Edition  ($39.98; Warner Bros.) includes a
widescreen and chopped up pan and scan version (though why anyone would want the inferiorfull-screen version in this day and age is beyond me), lots of extras including author JeanShepherd reading some of his work, a chef's apron, cookie cutters inspired by the movie and it allcomes in a cookie tin. For many of us, an esential.
THE MAN IN BLACK  -- Johnny Cash hosted four holiday TV specials from 1976-1979, and all of
them are collected in The Johnny Cash Christmas Specials  ($49.98; Shout). You get 66 musical
numbers by Cash and his family and friends on four discs. The styles range from downhome

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-holiday-dvd-roundup_b_151528.html [4/5/2009 12:54:26 PM]intimacy the first year to a Los Angeles soundstage the third year complete with then rising comic
Steve Martin doing variations on his biggest routines. Whenever Cash is centerstage with a guitar,
nothing could be better and lots of guest stars keep this lively if somewhat dated in a charming, 70s
variety hour way. Chris Isaak's shiny white suit gives the Man in Black a run for his money and
Chris Isaak Christmas  ($19.99; Koch) is a pure winner. I loved his TV show on Showtime and
Isaak's droll humor and ironic sincerity (is that even possible) make him an ideal host as he rocks
his way through holiday gems with his band and guests like Michael Buble and Stevie Nicks.
OFF THE BEATEN PATH  -- If you've watched those holiday favorites once too often and want
to give 'em a rest, the blandly packaged Classic Holiday DVD Collection Volume 2 ($29.98;
Warner Bros.) is a great bargain with four little known flicks from the 40s and 50s. All Mine To
Give  is about th eldest sibling of six orphans who finds a home for each of his brothers and sisters
during pioneer days. It Happened On 5th Avenue  is about a bum who takes over a rich man's
mansion and invites his friends along. Blossoms in the Dust  is a three hankie affair about Greer
Garson as a woman who founds an orphanage after she loses her own child. And best of the lot isRobert Mitchum in Holiday Affair -- he plays an unemployed clerk who splurges on a train set for a
little boy he hardly knows. The big softie!
CLASSIC TV, SMARTLY PACKAGED  -- Special Christmas episodes are a tradition on TV,
especially for sitcoms. TV Sets: Holiday Treats ($12.98; Paramount) has an ugly cover but don't let
bad wrapping fool you into missing out on this bargain. It collects eight holiday-themed episodes ofhit shows from the 60s to the 90s, ranging from The Andy Griffith Show  (Andy and Barney throw
a Christmas party for a prisoner) to The Honeymooners  (Ralph sells his bowling ball to get Alice a
nice gift) to The Brady Bunch  (mom gets laryngitis. Other shows include I Love Lucy, Taxi, Family
Ties, Wings  and Frasier. Doris Day: Christmas Memories  ($14.98; MPI) contains three holiday
episodes from her sitcom but what really won me over were the extras: commentary from Dayherself (who is LONG overdue for an honorary Oscar), newsreels of Day, and holiday episodes ofher radio show. A Shari Lewis Christmas ($9.98; S'More) also is generous. You get her threeholiday shows (best for old folks looking to get nostalgic and the very young), plus another onefrom her local New York show Hi Mom,  and a theatrical trailer offering a Christmas greeting from
Lewis and Lamb Chop. Finally, if the relatives are getting on your nerves, you can fantasize aboutmurder and escape America with Lovejoy Christmas Specials  (($24.98; BBC Video). It contains
two 90 minute movies set during the holidays -- one in Prague and the other in North Carolina andif spending Christmas with Ian McShane seems odd, you've been watching too much Deadwood.
WOULD-BE TV CLASSICS MAKE THEIR CASE  -- Five new specials hope to get lodged in
your brain and at least two of them might just do it. A Colbert Christmas: The Greatest Gift Of All
($19.99; Paramount) pretended to mock those Bing Crosby specials from the 70s but in fact lovedthem and did its best to recreate their silly charm, thanks to some fine original songs and musical
guests like Elvis Costello, Feist, Willie Nelson and even a singing Jon Stewart. Wonder Pets: Save
The Nutcracker!  ($16.99; Paramount) is a clever way to introduce that classic ballet's music to a
toddler and the three other episodes included ain't holiday themed but will surprise adults who
haven't sampled this silly, musically sophisticated show yet. I love Sesame Street  and Dora The
Explorer is better than GPS in my book, but Elmo's Christmas Countdown  ($14.93; Genius) and
Dora Celebrates Three Kings Day  ($16.99; Paramount) are both DVDs the kids can watch while
I'm in the next room cooking or playing video poker or something. And while I've never been a bigfan of the Shrek  movie franchise, I was very pleasantly surprised by the TV special Shrek The Halls
($19.99; Dreamworks). It's priced too high for a 22 minute TV episode but it cut back on theincessant pop cultural references and created a genuinely delightful holiday gem.
OLD VS. NEW AND BLACK/WHITE VS. COLOR  -- Why anyone would watch the live action
Jim Carrey version of Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas when the animated TV special is
so perfect is beyond me. But if you don't own it and want it, this Limited Edition Collectible GiftSet ($34.98; Universal) contains loads of extras and a snow globe to boot. Similarly, why anyone
would want a colorized version of Holiday Inn  (the Bing Crosby flick that introduced "White
Christmas") is also a head-scratcher but this new edition ($26.98; Universal) has a lovely newblack and white print, a colorized version you can hand off to someone you don't like and a CDwith 12 songs from the soundtrack including "Happy Holidays."
MORE HOLIDAY HOPEFULS  -- Among the other titles with holiday themes that strove for
classic status (but fell short) are  Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage  ($19.98; Lionsgate); Jim
Henson's The Christmas Toy  ($14.98; Lionsgate/Hit) which is minus the Kermit bookend; Rankin

I'm surprised no one has mentioned "A Christmas Carol."
The 1951 British film "Scrooge" starring Alistair Sim is essential viewing in our house at Christmas. He
was definitely the best Scrooge to ever grace the big screen -- a real mean bastard at the beginning,
but barely able to contain his own joyous compassion by the film's end. The rest of the movie holds upvery well -- even the primitive special effects. And hardcore fans of classic British cinema & TV willenjoy seeing some familiar faces in the supporting cast like Michael Hordern and a very young Patrick
MacNee (aka "John Steed" of The Avengers).
"Scrooge" was finally given a proper DVD release a few years ago. The film itself looks great, but the
DVD extras are pretty much worthless. There is a second disc with a colorized version of the film (gag!)and an awkward commentary with the actor who played the 'young" Ebenezer Scrooge which isn'tparticularly informative or entertaining. But the movie is so good, I still consider this disc a "must-own."

We watch the Jim Carrey GRINCH because it fleshes out Dr. Seuss' original intent: a protest of thecommercialization of Christmas. In the cartoon, the Grinch was simply a generic villain who acted like a
jerk simply to be a jerk; in the live-action one, the Whos brought it upon themselves by mocking him for
no reason. And ya gotta love how the Grinch calls them out on their mindless, self-righteous greed
before going Delta-House-at-the-homecoming-parade on them.

Good defense. Ron Howard and Jim carrey should send you at least a Happy Holidays card!
ecunning See Profile  I'm a Fan of ecunning  permalink
Another good one you may not have heard of is "Bernard and the Genie," starring Lenny Henry and
Alan Cumming. British, hysterical, and heartwarming.
Alan plays Bernard, a schlubby little guy whose holiday goes terribly wrong: he gets fired from his job,
his girlfriend leaves him for his best friend, and his apartment is emptied in the process.
Then, he picks up the one thing she left behind--an old lamp--and polishes it...
Enter Lenny Henry, a wild and crazy genie who has a little trouble adjusting to the loss of 3000 years.
But Bernie, Big Macs, ice cream, soul music, and movies help.
Crises ensue, but it all works out wonderfully in the end.You'll LOVE it.

Nope, hadn't heard of that one either, though Alan Cumming has a genie is easy to believe.
I'll look for it. Thx.

A Muppet Family Christmas. My absolute favorite.
If you like the Muppets, this has Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and the Muppets all as one big crazy
family getting together for the holidays. All the original performers, full of that zany Muppet humor, anda cameo by Jim Henson at the end. Best thing they ever did. I think it was Jim's favorite, too.
(The original uncut version from TV is the very best--they had to edit out some of the songs for
VHS/DVD release due to licensing issues.)

A charmer and one I haven't seen in a while. I actually avoid watching the same moviesevery single year so I don't dim the pleasure of It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas Story, Charlie
Brown Pee-wee et al. But Miracle on 34 St has rested for a few years and I need to see it
again.

A wonderful Christmas DVD is the 1963 Judy Garland Christmas show--with Mel Tome, Jack Jones,
and Liza, Lorna, and Joey--the grandmama of all Christmas specials, and a fascinating snapshot of itsfragile star and her era. It's a camp classic, of course, but there's something poignant about thisobviously troubled person playing out a fantasy version of her life.http://www.tvparty.com/xmasjudy.html
And us "A Christmas Carol" fans will get our annual Alastair Sim fix, but a good alternative is the
George C. Scott TV version from the '80s. Nice production values, impeccably cast, smart script, and
Scott is magnificent. It recalls a pre-cable, pre-Internet time when the big-three networks had lots of
money to spend on their prestige shows. Hard to imagine CBS mounting such a lavish productiontoday.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I might watch Scott again just to give Sims a rest, but Sims is absolutely the one to beat whenit comes to A Christmas Carol. (On DVD, mind you. I'd go see Patrick Stewart do his one-man show every year if I could and don't ever miss the chance if you can see him either.) Iactually own that Judy garland episode but have never watched it. I'll give it a whirl this year.Thx.

Capote's "A Christmas Memory" is one of my favorites--a PBS B&W classic with the great GeraldinePage and Capote's narration. I was surprised by how affecting it was.

The German "Die Feuerzangenbowle" from 1944! 
It's a delightful little comedy. Shot during pretty dark times. A tradition for older Germans. 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036818/
And of course the Russian: The Irony of Fate, or "Enjoy Your Bath" 
http://www.russiandvd.com/store/product.asp?sku=30442&aid=7359&lang=eng
This one is especially poignant. The bit where the main heroine walks through the night Leningrad is
worth the price of the DVD alone.

OK, you win for most obscure picks of all. I'll keep an eye out for both of them and hopefullythey'll get released on DVD in US in the years to come.

"Gremlins". You can't deny that one.
When I watched "White Christmas" (starring Bing Crosby), I heckled it like on "Mystery Science Theater

We start every season with A Charlie Brown Christmas. The animated Grinch comes in a close second.The old Rankin/Bass animated ones are OK (though as an adult, I can't miss the counter-culturethemes, especially in the later ones). Little Drummer Boy is a notable exception, and I tend to enjoy itbetter as the years go on. Of course, Year Without A Santa Clause, if only for the show stopping MiserBrothers. And for me, I also watch Spies Like Us. Sounds silly, but I have a beer and watch that inmemory of a very fun time in life when my best friend and I saw it right before the first Christmas break
our first year of college. Though you never know when a new one will come along and add itself to the

list. I saw an old theatrical production called House Without A Christmas Tree, and every so many
years like to watch it. It's a Wonderful Life is nice every so many years. And of course, A Christmas
Story 24 hours on Christmas Eve. Nice post. Thanks for the memories.

The Miser Brothers can't be beat. Did you watch the new sequel that just aired on ABCFamily with them? I've never seen House Without A Christmas Tree -- I'll have to keep awatch out for it.

No, I didn't see the new one. I was taken by the change in their appearance. Andwithout Dick Shaun, I wondered if it would have that same 'zing' that the original did.
As for House without a Christmas tree, it starred the late, great Jason Robards as a
man embittered by the loss of his wife who won't allow his daughter to have a
Christmas tree because of the memories it brings. It was a TV movie, much like a
filmed play. My parents bought me the VCR tape, so I don't know if it is DVD or not. I
think my Dad liked it because his Dad was never overly sentimental when it came toletting his kids celebrate Christmas (one year their ironing board doubled as the
'Christmas Tree'). So good luck finding it, it's quaint, believable, and a hidden little
gem in the army of specials that are out there.

Denis Leary's best movie -- and clearly we know a little bit more about your family life :)Thanks for reading.
