6/18/2005 11:25:00 AMBush has yet to remove all science from high school scienceclassrooms (Hey, they're working on it). But he's doing anEXCELLENT job of removing any annoying scientific facts fromgovernment reports.The latest travesty. The LA Times reports a Bush official cut outessential scientific warnings on what was supposed to be ascientific study of the environmental impact of cattle grazing onpublic lands. No bonus points for guessing whether the revisedstudy favored industry over the environment.The original draft of the environmental analysis warned thatthe new rules would have a "significant adverse impact" onwildlife, but that phrase was removed. The BLM nowconcludes that the grazing regulations are "beneficial toanimals."Eliminated from the final draft was another conclusion thatread: "The Proposed Action will have a slow, long-termadverse impact on wildlife and biological diversity ingeneral."Also removed was language saying how the rules changescould adversely affect endangered species."This is a whitewash, they took all of our science andreversed it 180 degrees," said Erick Campbell, a formerBLM state biologist in Nevada and a 30-year BLM employeewho retired this year. Campbell was the author of sectionsof the report pertaining to impacts on wildlife andthreatened and endangered species. "They rewroteeverything. It's a crime," he said in an interview this week.Hey, this isn't unusual or strange. It's just the way they do business.So why should it be more than a blip in the media? Bush's peopledistorting facts to suit their own purposes? Come on, that's old news.
