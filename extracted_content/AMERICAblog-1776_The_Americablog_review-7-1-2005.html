7/01/2005 05:51:00 PM1776 By David McCullough($32; Simon & Schuster)*** (three stars out of four)What a glorious year! The brave rebellion against England, theDeclaration of Independence, the founding of our country --who couldn't love 1776?Actually, as historian David McCullough reminds us in hisentertaining new book, for those living through 1776, it was adark, dangerous and unhappy year that everyone was glad tosee end. He gives some brisk context and then dives into themonths just before that pivotal year, showing how desperatelyslim were the hopes of the colonists; how a simple olive branchmight have made our destiny more akin to Canada; and how afortunate fog, some well-placed barrels and a timely retreatcan prove just as important for victory as bravery on the field.It's easy to imagine McCullough's soothing narrative voice(which has brought so much artistry to the documentaries ofKen Burns) bringing out the drama in his writing. Take thispassage describing the British rout of Americans in Brooklynduring August of that year:"By ten o'clock [Washington's] army had been hopelesslyoutflanked. The British were within two miles of theBrooklyn lines. Defeated men by the hundreds werestreaming in from the battlefield, many blood-spattered andwounded, all exhausted. Officers were missing. Washingtonwas facing disaster and could do nothing but sit astride hishorse and watch.Like McCullough's blockbuster biographies of John Adams and HarryTruman (not to mention his less well-known but terrific books on thebuilding of the Panama Canal and the Johnstown Flood), he is alwaysadept at bringing men alive. Here he spends special attention onNathanael Greene, a Quaker, and self-taught military strategist HenryKnox, both of whom would serve General Washington so well.But above all he reanimates Washington. McCullough's depiction ofhim reminds me quite a bit of Reagan. Both were proufoundly awareof "acting" a role and knew that the demeanor and perceptions of aleader were just as important as what he actually did. Washingtonmade mistake after mistake in the early going, but he was outwardlyconfident and supremely inspiring...by design.At 294 pages (not counting footnotes), this isn't the sort of mammothenterprise people have come to expect from McCullough. Clearly hewas so enthralled with this moment in history while working on hismarvelous biography of John Adams that McCullough couldn't resist.So perhaps its central flaw is timing. This title comes hard on theheels of David Hackett Fischer's "Washington's Crossing," the PulitzerPrize-winning book that covers the same period in far more detail andinsight. (One small example -- McCullough touches briefly on how thevolunteers from different colonies were often at odds with oneanother; Hackett Fischer breaks them down in fascinating detail,showing what motivated the different groups and how theirbackground and culture even influenced their style of fighting andsuitability to serving in an army.)McCullough's "1776" certainly won't disappoint his fans or fail todelight and inform armchair historians. Judged on its own, it isadmirable. But this same territory has just been conquered far moredefinitively by another.
