has a sure-to-be controversial documentary coming soon.
"I even love playing the red states," says
Mahe4 whose newest HBO standup spe-
cial, "The Decider," airs live from Bos-
ton on Saturday. "San Francisco doesn't
need me. But when I play St. Louis or Salt
Lake City, those people are really happy
that somebody with my views has come to
their town."
Aperennial bachelor (and proud some-
time guest at the Playboy Mansion), Ma-
het 51, born in NewYork and raised in
NewJersey, knows what it's like to be un-
welcome: In 2001, he lost his ABC show
"Politically Incorrect" after echoing point-
ed rqmarks made by one of his conserva-
tive guests about the 9/l I hijackers.'
"There was a time when I was afraid
to go out of the house," says Maher, who
was singled out during White House press
conferences when single-minded patrio-tism uninterested in hearing dissent was
perhaps at its peak. "I thought people
would just slug me. It's quite a feeling to
be America's No. I hated object."
But now Maher enjoys the acclaim of
his one-hour talk-and-panel show Friday
nights at 11 p.m. that draws in top politi-
cians and thinkers. And the country he
says, is much more in sync with him.
"We're stuckwith fPresident Bush] for
the next year and a half," says Maher, who
initially supported the invasion of lraq.
"What I'm sensing out there is frustration.
There was acceptance ofhim and thdn
there was hope ...There was a time when
being against Bush was sort of un-Ameri-
can. Those davs have ended."
