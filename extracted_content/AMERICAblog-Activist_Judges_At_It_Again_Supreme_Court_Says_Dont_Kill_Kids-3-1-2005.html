3/01/2005 12:24:00 PMYes, in a decision that will surely infuriate the far right, thosewacky activist, unelected justices at the Supreme Court haveruled 5-4 that the United States can no longer execute minors.According to the New York Times, this affects about 70 juvenilemurderers who will now be pampered by spending the rest oftheir lives behind bars.It's infuriating, but this means the US will be forced to join therest of the civilized world in not killing kids -- we'll have tobreak away from the few nations still brave enough to executeminors; fine, upstanding countries like Iran, Pakistan, SaudiArabia and China.It's very hard, coming so soon on the heels of that wackyactivist decision that said we can't kill the mentally retardedeither. As Justice Scalia almost said in his dissent, "This sucks."
