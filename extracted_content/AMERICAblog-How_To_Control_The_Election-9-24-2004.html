9/24/2004 03:59:00 PMI'm addicted to the Los Angeles Times' electoral map. It shows all thestates and how many electoral votes they offer. States which areclearly going to Bush or Kerry are shaded for that candidate.The addictive part is two-fold. First, putting the arrow on any statecalls up the latest polls to show where the candidates stand. Second,you can click on a state several times, changing their status in anyway you like -- giving Florida to Kerry or Florida to Bush and seeingthe change in the electoral vote totals. Go across the country andmake your predictions on California (which the LA Times has justcalled for Kerry), Michigan, New Jersey and so on. You can map outany kind of scenario you want: Texas for Kerry! Massachusetts forBush. The scary/exciting part is that once you swing enough statesfor a candidate, the site starts to play "Hail to the Chief." The firsttime it happened, I'd thrown a few states like California and Florida toBush and when the music started playing I practically jumped out ofmy skin. In context, it's scarier than the theme from "Jaws."Enjoy controlling the election -- you'll feel just like Jeb Bush!
