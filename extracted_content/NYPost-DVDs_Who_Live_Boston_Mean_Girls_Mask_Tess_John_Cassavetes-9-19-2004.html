Mean Girls 
* Paramount, $29.95 
AN inept teen comedy about 
the new girl in school (a likable 
Lindsay Lohan) who hangs 
with the cool clique until she 
realizes it's not nice to be 
mean. The finale shows her 
winning a popularity contest 
and sharing it with "losers" like 
a kid in a wheelchair and a fat 
girl that the movie has never 
spent more than two moments 
with. Nice try. 
The First Churchills *** . Acorn, $79.99 
YES, every TV show will come 
out on DVD. You _can now pick 
up the very first entry in 
"Masterpiece Theatre," which 
stars John Neville in a 
prototypical costume drama. Or 
enjoy Ray Walston's puckish 
turn in "My Favorite Martian 
First Season" (Rhino, $39.98). 
And cult hit cop show "Keen 
Eddie Complete Series" 
(Paramount, $39.98) is rescued 
from the obscurity so many 
short-lived shows once suffered. 
Mask/Tess ***/***'/2 Universal/Columbia TriStar, 
$19.98/$24.96 
"MASK" (1985) is about a 
horribly disfigured teenager (the 
terrific Eric Stoltz) whose The Who: Live 
in Boston 
** W5M,$19.99 
THE show went on 
when longtime Who 
bass player John 
Entwistle died on the 
eve of a U.S tour in 
2002. And the less than 
stellar results are 
captured on "The Who: 
Live in Boston" (WSM, 
$19.99). But for the band 
at its finest, check out 
"The Who Live at the 
Isle of Wight Festival" 
(Eagle Vision, $19.98). It 
doesn't include all the 
footage or the song 
order of the concert, but 
what's here is great. 
Also out: UB40's 2003 
show "Homegrown in 
Holland Live" (WSM. 
$19.98). 
ugliness is really only a burden 
for others. This director's cut 
features seven extra minutes and 
the Bruce Springsteen songs the 
real-life teen loved. "Tess" (1979) 
is a period piece about a woman 
(Nastassja Kinski) whose beauty 
becomes her downfall when she 
attracts the attraction of her 
employer's lustful son. 
John cassavetes: 
F"nfe Films ***'/2 Criterion, $124.95 
FOR the esteemed but 
somewhat forgotten John 
Cassavetes (when was the last 
time you saw a movie 
influenced by him?), Criterion 
compiles this brilliant boxed set 
of five films, including -
among others -1968's "Faces," 
1974's'1\. Woman Under The 
Influence" and two versions of 
1976's "The Killing Of A Chinese 
Bookie." The many extras 
include workshop footage and 
new interviews with Cassavetes' 
wife, actress Gena Rowlands, 
Peter Falk et al.</p>
