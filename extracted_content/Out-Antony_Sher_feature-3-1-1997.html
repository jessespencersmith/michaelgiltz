            <p>coming Indian Summer, a film written 
by playwright Martin Sherman (Bent). 
Sher's role in Stanley is at the opposite 
end of the sexual spectrum: Stanley 
Spencer was a painter who scandalized 
Britain because he set his religious 
works in local settings (the 
Resurrection in Cookham, for exam­
ple) and couldn't see why an artist 
should be limited to just one woman. 
Perhaps Sher's Broadway experi­
ence will one day turn up in print: His 
just-published Woza Shakespear e! (pub­
lished in the u.K. by Methuen) is the 
actor's diary about mounting Titus 
Andronicus in his homeland, South 
Mrica. It serves as a sequel of sorts to 
Year of the King, an acclaimed 1985 work 
recounting a production of Richard III. 
In King, Sher makes only passing ref­
erence to his "roommate," Jim. But 
Woza-co-written with his partner of 
10 years, Gregory Doran-finds Sher 
getting irked when Doran isn't allowed 
to accompany him to an audience with 
Prince Edward, joining in a Gay Pride 
march with Ian McKellen, and gener­
ally acting like a model citizen of the 
queer nation. 
Renaissance actor Antony Sher crosses the Atlantic. "Growing up in Cape Town 
[South Mrica] when I did, I was the 
only gay person in the world," Sher 
says of his gradual coming out. "My 
partner Greg, growing up here in the 
u.K., had exactly the same feeling. So 
whenever we do publicity and mention 
it casually, it is simply to make it there: ONDON-BASED actor Antony 
Sher enters Marsden's, a 
French restaurant in a 
sleepy suburb of the city, 
with a mildly distracted air, 
as if he interrupted some 
project to keep this ren­
dezvous. It could be any number of 
things: more research on Disraeli, the 
character he portrays in Her Majesty, 
Mrs. Brown, which Sher is currently 
filming; working on a novel, since he's 
already published three accomplished 
books, most recently Cheap Lives, 
about a gay man haunted by the fact 
he was spared by a notorious serial 
killer; or perhaps he was just working 
on a charcoal sketch or writing in his 
well-known diary. 
Whatever it was, the trip home to 
50 MARCH I997 OUT his work will be a short one, since Sher 
lives just around the corner. The 47-
year-old actor will make a much longer 
journey when he brings Stanlera play 
written expressly for him by Pam 
Gems-to Broadway in February, These people are doing these jobs and 
making his belated New 
York theatrical debut. 
Sher has been a 
major force in British the­
ater for 15 years. There, he they're not making a big 
issue of it." "Growing up in Cape Town 
when I did, I was the only 
gay person in the world." Also not making a 
big issue of the time, Sher 
looks discreetly at his 
watch. "The oils are calling," he says, 
revealing that it was a painting he was 
torn away from for this visit. He says 
his goodbyes and heads home. says matter-of-factly, ''I'm usually 
offered the roles." Movies are another 
matter. "I hate auditioning," Sher con­
tinues. "It just seems to throw out the 
window everything I believe about act­
ing." Nevertheless, he gives a strong 
performance as an angry, somewhat 
dumpy therapist who falls in love with 
an HI V-positive dancer in the forth--MICHAEL GILTZ
