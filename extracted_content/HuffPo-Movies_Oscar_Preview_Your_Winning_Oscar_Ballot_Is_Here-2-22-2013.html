            <p>Movies:  Oscar  Preview  --  Your
Winning  Oscar  Ballot  Is  Here!
If you want to win big at your Oscar party and pick the winners of the Academy Awards, I
have one simple piece of advice: don't watch any of the movies. If you watch the movies,you get caught up in what's actually good, what you loved and what you hated, ratherthan the only question that matters: what will win. It's liking betting on your collegesports team. No one wants to bet against their own school. It's a great way to lose money.
Like most people, I don't follow my own advice. So here is my Oscar ballot with all its
quirks and personal preferences. I can't guarantee you'll win your betting pool. But if youhave watched a lot of the nominees, I can guarantee the Oscars will pick at least onewinner that drives you absolutely bonkers. ("How could they possibly...??!!??") Hey, that'shalf the fun. I put the shorts at the bottom in their own section because most people don'tsee them and they're really hard to pick this year and worth discussing more fully.

<p>Argo
Beasts  Of  The  Southern  Wild
Django  UnchainedLes  MiserablesLife  Of  PiLincolnSilver  Linings  PlaybookZero  Dark  Thirty
If I were voting, I'd pick Amour . I'd also be very happy if Django  Unchained  or Beasts  Of
The  Southern  Wild shocked everyone. (Not gonna happen.) I was decidedly not a fan of
Life  Of  Pi,  so that's the win that would frustrate and annoy me the most, which is what
Oscar truly loves to do. But I'll go with the smart money on this.
The Winner: Argo
BEST  DIRECTOR
Michael Haneke -- Amour
Ang Lee -- Life  Of  Pi
David O. Russell -- Silver  Linings  Playbook
Steven Spielberg -- LincolnBenh Zeitlin -- Beasts  Of  The  Southern  Wild
If i were voting, I'd pick Michael Haneke, under the quaint notion that the best film of the
year must by definition include the best direction of the year. Haneke is a rigorousfilmmaker whose movies I have admired but rarely loved. This is an unexpected late careerturn which, while hardly sentimental, is far more open-hearted and emotional than onewould expect from Haneke. It's the very reason this movie about an elderly couple facingdeclining health is not maudlin. For heaven's sake, go see it in a theater. This is not onefor popping into your DVD player, pausing while you answer your phone or surf the weband so on. I'd also be delighted if Benh Zeitlin won for Beasts , despide that annoying "h"
in his name. The three other movies were all strongly admired by voters so anything ispossible here. But the smart money is on the one-time front runner Lincoln .
The Winner: Steven Spielberg -- Lincoln
BEST  ACTORBradley Cooper -- Silver  Linings  Playbook
Daniel Day-Lewis -- LincolnHugh Jackman -- Les  MiserablesJoaquin Phoenix -- The  MasterDenzel Washington -- Flight
If I were voting, I'd be tempted to pick Joaquin Phoenix for his unlikable, unknowable,
squirrelly (in every sense :) turn in The  Master.  But ultimately I'd be ashamed to give it to
anyone but Day-Lewis. The Academy feels the same way. Perhaps it's most notable for notfeeling like a flashy, big performance. You just spend the movie wondering how theytracked Lincoln down and convinced him to star in this movie.
The Winner: Daniel Day-Lewis -- LincolnBEST  ACTRESS
Jessica Chastain -- Zero  Dark  Thirty
Jennifer Lawrence -- Silver  Linings  PlaybookEmmanuelle Riva -- AmourQuvenzhane Wallis -- Beasts  Of  The  Southern  WildNaomi Watts -- The  Impossible
The smart money is on Jennifer Lawrence. But having seen Amour , I find it difficult to
imagine any voter who watches it choosing anyone but Riva. She's an iconic French</p>
<p>actress, she would be the oldest winner in Oscar history, it would acknowledge this great
film (and the performance of her co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant, which is just as
marvelous) and it's her birthday on Oscar night! As a bonus, it's also one of the mostremarkable screen performances you'll ever see. If you wanna play it safe, go for
Lawrence, I guess. But there's a real chance for an upset here and you can't go with the
obvious choice every single time or you'll just have the same ballot as most everyone else.
Sometimes, I'd rather go with my heart and be wrong.
The winner: Emmanuelle Riva -- AmourBEST  SUPPORTING  ACTOR
Alan Arkin -- Argo
Robert De Niro -- Silver  Linings  PlaybookPhilip Seymour Hoffman -- The  MasterTommy Lee Jones -- LincolnChristoph Waltz -- Django  Unchained
Everyone in this category has won before and you can make a convincing case for why
any one of them will triumph (except for Hoffman). I think the smart money is on TommyLee Jones, though it's so close to call you might also say prognosticators are leaningtowards Christoph Waltz, who is so hilariously good in Django . Waltz would certainly get
my vote, though I think he belongs in the Best Actor category alongside Jamie Foxx andmight go with the equally good Hoffman. But if my bet is right and Riva beats Lawrencefor Best Actress, I think voters will want to acknowledge Silver  Linings  Playbooksomehow. For me, De Niro has always been the sentimental favorite only Jones has goneso long in not winning) and it's his best performance in a long, long time.
The Winner: Robert De Niro -- Silver  Linings  PlaybookBEST  SUPPORTING  ACTRESSAmy Adams -- The  Master
Sally Field -- Lincoln
Anne Hathaway -- Les  Miserables
Helen Hunt -- The  Sessions
Jacki Weaver -- Silver  Linings  Playbook
The smart money is on Anne Hathaway, of course. She's almost as sure a bet as Daniel
Day-Lewis; I'm sure Vegas betting on both of them closed long, long ago. My vote goes forAmy Adams and her very contained, controlling turn in The  Master.  Playing cold really
suits her. But not as much as an Oscar will suit Hathaway for shaving her head andbelting it out.
The winner: Anne Hathaway -- Les  MiserablesBEST  WRITING  --  ORIGINAL  SCREENPLAYAmour  -- Michael Haneke
Django  Unchained  -- Quentin Tarantino
Flight  -- John Gatins
Moonrise  Kingdom  -- Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola
Zero  Dark  Thirty  -- Mark Boal
The smart money is on Django  Unchained  with Moonrise  Kingdom  a stalking horse now
that Zero  Dark  Thirty  is too tainted for liberal Oscar voters to embrace. (That's unfair but
true; whatever its faults in capturing the complexity of the official record, Zero  Dark
Thirty  is by no means pro-torture and endeavors to capture the moral dilemmas torturing
people raise.) I'd be happy if Amour  or Moonrise  won; though Moonrise  is not Anderson's
best it's a return to form. But Tarantino's work is sterling and hilarious and bold. Anyoneoffended by the dialogue in the movie should actually be offended by the dialogue in Gone
With  The  Wind,  not this tale of a man's revenge against brutal slave owners that uses the</p>
<p>coarse, dehumanizing language of the day.
The Winner: Django  Unchained  -- Quentin Tarantino
BEST WRITING -- ADAPTED SCREENPLAYArgo  -- Chris Terrio
Beasts  Of  The  Southern  Wild -- Lucy Alibar and Benh Zeitlin
Life  Of  Pi  -- David Magee
Lincoln  -- Tony Kushner
Silver  Linings  Playbook  -- David O. Russell
The smart money is on Argo , which is fine with me. If I were voting from this lot, I'd
choose Beasts  -- I have no idea how this movie sprang from a stage play and it's so
visually striking that it seems the best accomplishment of the group. As for Lincoln , I have
no problem with the kerfuffle over the voting record of imaginary politicians from
Connecticut. But my biggest problem with Lincoln was the screenplay, which buried a
solid hour of West  Wing -like political machinations with an unnecessary prologue and
tiresome epilogue showing the rest of Lincoln's life, the end of the Civil War and the
assassination when the story had ended with the passage of the 13th amendment. I also
despised the hagiography of the noble black characters, from the noble soldier to the
noble maid, both of whom are far more eloquent in their speechifying than anyone in sight
(including Lincoln) and arise to give their speeches at various points in fear that we might
otherwise forget what the 13th amendment was about. Worst of all was the White House
servant who gets a funny feeling and just has to turn around and take one last long at
Lincoln as he heads for the theater. I'll take Samuel L. Jackson's servant in DjangoUnchained  any day. Argo  messes with the historical record far more than Lincoln  but
they're just ignoring Canadians and that apparently is ok. (Sorry, Mom.)
The Winner: Argo  -- Chris Terrio
BEST ANIMATED FEATURE
Brave
FrankenweenieParaNormanThe  Pirates!  Band  Of  MisfitsWreck-It  Ralph
Frankly, none of these movies deserves the Oscar. Brave  would be a lock if Pixar's first
movie with a female heroine didn't have the unfortunate backstory of Pixar firing its first
female director. Frankenweenie  is an unnecessary expansion of a delightful short but the
Academy does love Tim Burton. ParaNorman  is a pretty good tale and the movie I'd
probably vote for, edging out Brave  just a tad. The  Pirates!  is silly fun but not quite as
good as other Aardman movies. The smart money is on Wreck-It  Ralph.  Having just
watched it, I'm astonished since it's the weakest of the bunch, mechanical and self-referential. Including references to old video games does not constitute characterdevelopment. On the assumption that Oscar loves to annoy me...
The Winner: Wreck-It  RalphBEST  FOREIGN  FILMAmour
Kon-TikiNoA  Royal  AffairWar  Witch
It seems like a lock but the foreign film category is notorious for bizarre choices. You have
to watch all five foreign films in order to vote so the fact that Amour  was such a popular
film with voters overall is meaningless. Still, it would be a shocking upset if Amour  didn't</p>
<p>win.
The Winner: Amour
BEST  DOCUMENTARY  FEATURE5  Broken  Cameras
The  GatekeepersHow  To  Survive  A  PlagueThe  Invisible  WarSearching  For  Sugar  Man
The smart money is on Searching  For  Sugar  Man.  Ironically, Argo,  Lincoln  and Zero
Dark  Thirty  are fictional films but have received all sorts of flak for their various fiddlings
with the truth in order to tell a coherent story. On the other hand, Searching  For  Sugar
Man  is misleading, disingenuous or if you prefer downright false in its storytelling in
order to create a simple sweet story that ignores a more complex truth. But no one seems
to care. AND IT'S A DOCUMENTARY!! They're actually SUPPOSED to be accurate.
Searching  For  Sugar  Man  tells the inspiring story of Sixto Rodriguez, an artist who
recorded two very good albums in the early 1970s, neither of which made a ripple
commercially in the U.S., and then slipped into obscurity. Little did he know that in
apartheid South Africa his music became wildly popular and was an inspiration for
rebellion among young white South Afrikaners who fought against the establishment. His
albums were mainstays, alongside Simon & Garfunkel and other 1970s blockbusters. The
rumor in that country was that Rodriguez had committed suicide onstage. So the film tellstwo stories: the story of an artist who works in construction and volunteers in various
social justice projects in Detroit, Michigan. One day he finds himself whisked to South
Africa where he's treated like a superstar. The other story is the one of fans who that
country who become obsessed with Rodriguez and just want to find out information on
him, only to discover the man isn't dead. It's like researching a story on Jimi Hendrix and
suddenly finding yourself on the phone with Hendrix. Imagine your astonishment. It's alltrue. But the movie ignores the fact that Rodriguez was also rediscovered in the late 1970sand early 1980s in Australia, where he toured, recorded a live album and even opened forMidnight Oil. That spoils the Cinderella nature of the film, however, when you learn ithappened before. Never mind that finding this out is even more interesting; clearlyRodriguez simply does not have the all-consuming drive for success that drives majorartists who achieve popular fame. Further the movie is incredibly slow and plodding. Hisdaughter shows us the website she stumbles on and reads the comment she left sayingRodriguez is her father. Then we see the South African who says he was told someone lefta comment and how he read it and then he reads her comment all over again. We know!We just heard it! Every stage is laboriously detailed, which keeps Rodriguez off camera forhalf the movie, a stunt to maintain the mystery as to whether he's alive or not but whichis meaningless since everyone who sees the movie knows that he is. Finally, theinterviewing is poor, the many questions not asked mount up (such as how does thisfigure of rebellion for a certain segment of the country feel about concerts that seem todraw almost exclusively white people? if there's a black face in the audience in thoseconcerts, I didn't see them. How could the film not discuss this wildly relevant issue,especially given his social activism? The entire movie feels like a simple-hearted cheat. It'snot trying to be deceptive so much as telling the story as they know it. But that ignoresthe far more interesting story staring them in the face. My pick would be How  To  SurviveA  Plague  followed very closely by The  Gatekeepers.  Both are on my best of the year list. So
guess what...
The winner: Searching  For  Sugar  ManBEST  ORIGINAL  SCOREAnna  Karenina  -- Dario Marianelli
Argo  -- Alexandre Desplat
Life  Of  Pi  -- Mychael Danna
Lincoln  -- John Williams</p>
<p>Skyfall  -- Thomas Newman
Uninspired choices. I'd vote for Skyfall  because it's good and action films rarely get
recognized for their scores. But the smart money is on Mychael Danna and Life  Of  Pi , the
least interesting work in a while from a good composer.
The Winner: Life  Of  Pi  -- Mychael Danna
BEST  ORIGINAL  SONG"Before My Time" from Chasing  Ice
"Everybody Needs A Best Friend" from Ted"Pi's Lullaby" from Life  Of  Pi"Skyfall" from Skyfall"Suddenly" from Les  Miserables
The smart money is on "Skyfall" because it's a great James Bond theme song and
absolutely deserves it. Plus, it's Adele!
The only remote competition is "Suddenly" from Les  Miserbles  but I barely noticed the
song and I know the stage musical very, very well. So barring an act of God...
The Winner: "Skyfall" from SkyfallBEST  SOUND  EDITINGArgo  -- Eric Aaadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn
Django  Unchained  -- Wylie Stateman
Life  Of  Pi  -- Eugene Gearty and Philip Stockton
Skyfall  -- Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers
Zero  Dark  Thirty  -- Paul N.J. Ottosson
The Winner: Life  Of  Pi  -- Eugene Gearty and Philip Stockton
BEST  SOUND  MIXING
Argo  -- John Reitz, Gregg Rudloff and Jose Antonio Garcia
Les  Miserables  -- Andy Nelson, Mark Paterson and Simon Hayes
Life  Of  Pi  -- Ron Bartlett, D.M. Hemphill and Drew Kunin
Lincoln  -- Andy Nelson, Gary Rydstrom and Ronald Judkins
Skyfall  -- Scott Millan, Greg P. Russell and Stuart Wilson
The Winner: Les  Miserables  -- Andy Nelson, Mark Paterson and Simon Hayes</p>
<p>The smart money is on...well, actually the smart money has no idea. Sound Editing and
Sound Mixing are two of the categories people feel completely at sea about, no matter how
often the Oscars do a segment showing how it works. However, Life  Of  Pi's  success is all
about technical achievement, so that movie is going to dominate the tech awards and it
will win Sound Editing. However, the people behind Les  Miserables  have done a good job
of hyping the fact that they recorded the singing live on the set (something not technically
feasible for the most part even a few years ago) and Sound Mixing is the one place where
the movie will get recognized other than Anne Hathaway.
BEST  PRODUCTION  DESIGN
Anna  Karenina  -- Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer
The  Hobbit:  An  Unexpected  Journey  -- Dan Hennah, Ra Vincent and Simon Bright
Les  Miserables  -- Eve Stewart and Anna Lynch-Robinson
Life  Of  Pi  -- David Gropman and Anna Pinnock
Lincoln  -- Rick Carter and Jim Erickson
I can talk myself into most anything but The  Hobbit  here. I'll deduct points from Life  Of
Pi because they'll dismiss it as all special effects. That leaves Lincoln  as the favorite of the
period pieces.The Winner: Lincoln  -- Rick Carter and Jim Erickson
BEST  CINEMATOGRAPHYAnna  Karenina  -- Seamus McGarvey
Django  Unchained  -- Robert Richardson
Life  Of  Pi  -- Claudio Miranda
Lincoln  -- Janusz Makinski
Skyfall  -- Roger Deakins
The smart money is on Life  Of  Pi.  Personally, I would have voted for the sterling work of
Richardson on Django  Unchained  -- it had fun with all the conventions of the spaghetti
westerns and 1970s movies in general, but always put the story and characters ahead of
jokey zoom shots and the like. Still, I hated the cotton candy color of Life  Of  Pi  so....
The Winner: Life  Of  Pi  -- Claudio Miranda
BEST MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING
Hitchcock  -- Howard Berger, Peter Montagna and Martin Samuel
The  Hobbit:  An  Unexpected  Journey  -- Peter Swords King, Rick Findlater and Tami Lane
Les  Miserables  -- Lisa Westcott and Julie Darnell
Special effects extravaganzas usually win though there's no love for The  Hobbit  from much
of anyone.   Les  Miserables  could sneak in here, but I'll still go with the splashy vote for all
those furry hobbit feet.
The Winner: The  Hobbit:  An  Unexpected  Journey  -- Peter Swords King, Rick Findlater
and Tami LaneBEST  COSTUME  DESIGN
Anna  Karenina  -- Jacqueline Durran
Les  Miserables  -- Paco Delgado
Lincoln  -- Joanna Johnston
Mirror,  Mirror  -- Eiko Ishioka
Snow  White  and  the  Huntsman  -- Colleen Atwood
It's a three way race but Lincoln  and Les  Miserables  were too dark and muddy. The pretty
dresses of Anna  Karenina  will win because Hollywood loves glamour.
The Winner: Anna  Karenina  -- Jacqueline Durran</p>
<p>BEST  FILM  EDITING
Argo  -- William Goldenberg
Life  Of  Pi  -- Tom Squyres
Lincoln  -- Michael Kahn
Silver  Linings  Playbook  -- Jay Cassidy and Crispin Struthers
Zero  Dark  Thirty  -- Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg
There's no obvious choice here but Argo  is the closest to an action film spectacle, the sort
that usually dominates this category.
The Winner: Argo  -- William Goldenberg
BEST  VISUAL  EFFECTS
The  Hobbit:  An  Unexpected  Journey  -- Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon, David Clayton and R.
Christopher White
Life  Of  Pi  -- Bill Westenhofer, Guillaume Rocheron, Erik-Jan de Boer and Donald R.
ElliottMarvel's  The  Avengers  -- Janek Sirrs, jeff White, Guy Williams and Dan Sudick
Prometheus  -- Richard Stammers, Trevor Wood, Charley Henley and Martin Hill
Snow  White  and  the  Huntsman  -- Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, Philip Brennan, Neil Corbould
and Michael Dawson.
The smart money, indeed all the money is on Life  Of  Pi.  I couldn't stand the look and
special effects of Life  Of  Pi  (and the 3-D was, as always, pointless). I'd vote for Marvel's
The  Avengers.  But there's little doubt that Life  Of  Pi  will win. Another one of the evening's
locks.The Winner: Life  Of  Pi  -- Bill Westenhofer, Guillaume Rocheron, Erik-Jan de Boer and
Donald R. Elliott

<p>The shorts categories used to be where you could really gain an edge back in the day. They
used to be seen only in NYC and LA and if you actually took the time to head to ascreening, you could often spot an obvious winner in at least two of the categories. Now
the shorts are shown commercially in some major cities, which is great. I'm glad they get
more attention. If you're lucky enough to live in a town where they're shown and you are
going to bet on the Oscars, by all means head to the screening. Winning two or threecategories that other people haven't a clue about is a great advantage.
Here in New York, the shorts are shown commercially. But for the past decade, they've
also been screened at the Academy Theatre at the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse is a worthygroup that fights vision loss through "prevention, treatment and empowerment." You canlearn more about their good work here.  (Can I get a discount on laser surgery? Uh, no.)
I've never quite understood why they have a movie theater there , but it's a great space for
the New York branch of The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences. They havemonthly screenings of classic Hollywood movies, usually with the director or star or somerelated talent present for a Q&A afterwards. It's very inexpensive (even if you're not amember) so if you're in NYC or LA sign up and get their newsletter so you can catch wordon future events.  They often sell out so you have to act fast.
It's a fun day catching the shorts, though with two and a half to three hours of material to
get through, I wish they'd skip all the padding and get to the movies as quickly as
possible. This year, the batch of shorts was mostly uninspiring and almost satirical in itsbutton-pushing subject matter (Somali pirates, cancer, Afghanistan -- you name it. If it's aheart-tugging or politically explosive topic, the shorts are certain to go there.
The smart money on the animated shorts is on Paperman , I think, because it's had the
most attention and posted itself online. But you have to attend screenings of all five shorts
to vote so that doesn't really give it an advantage. The  Simpsons  short The  Longest
Daycare  was solid but the 3-D was annoying and unnecessary and it felt simply like a
very good episode of The  Simpsons,  which is often Emmy worthy but not special enough
for this. Some liked the artiness of Adam  And  Dog  and others the romance of Paperman .
When I spoke to people at the screening, everyone had their own theory as to what wouldwin and when -- but ask them what they liked the most and everyone said Fresh
Guacamole.  It's clever, visually innovative and has a nice little kicker at the end; plus it's
the shortest of the five. I'm going with my heart on this one, especially since this category
has been pretty funky in recent years and gone with the cutting edge picks.
The live action shorts are hard to call as well, with no real standout. The smart money is
on Curfew  and I'm inclined to agree. Asad  and Buzkashi  Boys  have exotic settings but
cancel each other out. Death  Of  A  Shadow  is a murky, poorly thought out Twilight  Zone
episode. And the old man with dementia in Henry  can only remind everyone that Amour
was much much better. that leaves Curfew , which has an appealing sweetness amidst
black humor and a nice little moment at the end.
I didn't get a chance to catch the documentary shorts -- one big reason is that they're so
darn long. Thanks to digital cameras, independent filmmakers aren't hamstrung by theexpense of film stock. They can shoot and shoot and shoot to their heart's delight, whichmeans the documentary shorts are increasingly flabby and show no discipline in theirediting. Forty minutes is a novella length for movies -- not short enough to be a short andnot long enough to be a feature. Tighter is almost always better. Just going on thecleverest title and the most heart-tugging of a group of heart-tugging tales, I'm going withOpen  Heart.
Good luck on your Oscar pool! Let me know which category I'm crazily wrong about and
whether you win.
