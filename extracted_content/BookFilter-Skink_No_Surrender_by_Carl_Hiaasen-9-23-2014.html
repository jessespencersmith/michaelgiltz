Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayCall it what you will -- a mystery, a comic crime novel, a young adult novel, a book for teens, whatever. Essentially,it's another Carl Hiaasen romp and fans of any age will enjoy it. They'll especially enjoy it because Skink, the one-time governor of Florida and now avenging angel for nature and all-around nutty old coot is back. Just in time, too,because teenager Richard is in over his head. Richard's cousin has run off with a guy she met on the internet and itdoesn't take a crime reporter to know that's not a bright idea. Richard and Skink run away on their own to track downhis cousin and rescue her from a no-good skunk who's in more danger than the roadkill the gov scoops up and dineson every day. This is indeed a book that hits the right note for teens -- it's a little more adult than "Hoot," not so adultthat parents will frown, but never juvenile or talking down to its readers. Hiaasen also hits a few unexpected notesthat ring true, like a teenager that is furious with rage over what a bad guy might have done to his cousin and bestfriend but really, when it comes down to it, not ready to swing a golf club and pummel someone to death. Thank GodSkink is nearby to take care of the rough stuff. It's fun, it's silly, it's got some really good music (here's hoping kidsmake a mixtape of "Subterranean Homesick Blues," Jimi Hendrix, Creedence and more) and Hiaasen satisfies fansand probably will win a few new ones. Really, that's the most impressive achievement here -- how Hiaasen adapts tothe conventions of a new audience without for a moment betraying his funky, idiosyncratic voice. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say"The book itself is just a wonder, part love poem about the Florida wilds, part road-trip novel, and part thriller. Thesecond half of the book is a nail-biter to rival Cape Fear. I love Hiaasen for adults. I love Hiaasen for kids. But most ofall, I love this Hiaasen, which brings the two writers together in one book."  --Cory Doctorow"Skink and Richard make quite a dangerous and entertaining duo in a story that careens perfectly from one crazysituation to the next. Reluctant readers (especially guys) will surrender themselves to this page turner. Cross yourfingers that we haven’t seen the last of Skink!" -- Booklist, starred"If you were pursuing your cousin’s kidnapper across Florida, you would want a man like Skink at your side. Maybe."-- Kirkus Reviews"Skink is larger than life.... A presence to be reckoned with." -- The Horn Book"A high stakes, action-packed comedy with a lot of heart." —VOYAFrom the Hardcover edition.What You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
