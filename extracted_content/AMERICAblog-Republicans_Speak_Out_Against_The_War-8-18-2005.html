8/18/2005 02:30:00 PMThanks to DailyKos for rounding up these devastating quoteson the war:"You can support the troops but not the president."--Rep Tom Delay (R-TX)"Well, I just think it's a bad idea. What's going to happen isthey're going to be over there for 10, 15, maybe 20 years."--Joe Scarborough (R-FL)"Explain to the mothers and fathers of Americanservicemen that may come home in body bags why theirson or daughter have to give up their life?"--Sean Hannity, Fox News,"[The] President . . . is once again releasing Americanmilitary might on a foreign country with an ill-definedobjective and no exit strategy. He has yet to tell theCongress how much this operation will cost. And he has notinformed our nation's armed forces about how long they willbe away from home. These strikes do not make for a soundforeign policy."--Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA)"If we are going to commit American troops, we must becertain they have a clear mission, an achievable goal andan exit strategy."--Karen Hughes, speaking on behalf of George W Bush"I had doubts about the bombing campaign from thebeginning . . I didn't think we had done enough in thediplomatic area."--Senator Trent Lott (R-MS)"I cannot support a failed foreign policy. History teaches usthat it is often easier to make war than peace. Thisadministration is just learning that lesson right now. ThePresident began this mission with very vague objectivesand lots of unanswered questions. A month later, thesequestions are still unanswered. There are no clarified rulesof engagement. There is no timetable. There is nolegitimate definition of victory. There is no contingency planfor mission creep. There is no clear funding program. Thereis no agenda to bolster our over-extended military. There isno explanation defining what vital national interests are atstake. There was no strategic plan for war when thePresident started this thing, and there still is no plan today"--Rep Tom Delay (R-TX)"Victory means exit strategy, and it's important for thePresident to explain to us what the exit strategy is."--Governor George W. Bush (R-TX)Oh, wait, did I mention these were Republicans denouncing Clintonfor committing troops to Bosnia? Every reporter in the country shouldquote these very words back to those yahoos and force them tocomment. (Thanks to threader sans-culotte for pointing us to this.)
