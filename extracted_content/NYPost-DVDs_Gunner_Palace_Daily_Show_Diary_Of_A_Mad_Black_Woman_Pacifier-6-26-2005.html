The Daily Show 
With 
Jon Stewart: 
Indecision 2004 
*** Paramount, $39.99 
THIS collection of political 
convention coverage from 
"The Daily Show" should have 
come out right after the 
election results were in. Still, 
for topital political humor, 
this holds up very well. The 
extras include our national 
anthem sung in "four­
correspondent harmony" and 
Stephen Colbert's award-not­
winning segment "Requiem 
For a Show That Was Daily." 
Diary 
ofaMad 
Black Woman 
** Lions Gate, $28.98 
WRITER-STAR Tyler Perry 
entered the mainstream with 
this smash hit fIlm version of 
his message-heavy, comic 
drama about a woman dumped 
by her husband. Most of Perry's 
plays are available on DVD, but 
they're just filmed versions of 
his shows. This modestly 
budgeted film opens up the 
play but keeps the story's 
dizzying switches between 
melodrama and broad comedy 
leavened by wholesome 
sermonizing and Perry in drag 
as his most famous creation Gunner Palace 
*** Palm Pictures, $24.99 
THIS admirably 
apolitical documentary 
gives an American 
soldier's-eye view of the 
war in Iraq by staying 
with a group stationed 
in one ofUday 
Hussein's residences. 
The fIlmmaking is 
unremarkable -
anyone brave enough to 
stay with these guys for 
a few months could 
have obtained similar 
footage. But co-
directors Michael 
Tucker and Petra 
Epperlein actually did 
it, capturing the black 
humor, decency and 
resolve of the soldiers 
without glossing over 
their shortcomings. 
Grandma Madea. Extras 
include commentarY and a 
featurette abOut Perry. 
The Pacifier 
*'/2 
Disney. $29.99 -------
SCHWARZENEGGER 
wannabe Yin Diesel's career ' -is 
'i.-' 
was flat-lining, thanks to the 
underperforming "XXX" from 
2002 and outright duds like 
2001's "Knockaround Guys," ., __ 
and 2004's "The Chronicles of -
Riddick." Inexplicably, it's 
been revived by this hit about 
a Navy SEAL ordered to pose 
as a babysitter. Critics 
groaned, audiences laughed 
and Mr. Diesel presumably 
sighed with relief. Modest 
extras include deleted scenes 
and "outrageous" bloopers. 85
