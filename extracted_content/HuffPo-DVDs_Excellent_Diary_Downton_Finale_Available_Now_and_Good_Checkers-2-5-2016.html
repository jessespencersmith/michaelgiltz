DVDs: Excellent "Diary;" "Downton's" Finale
Available Now and Good "Checkers"

Here we go: One of the best movies of the year ( The Diary Of A Teenage
Girl), this week's edition of "the best TV show you're not watching"
(Banshee ), Spielberg's weakest in a while ( Bridge Of Spies ) and more.
THE DIARY OF A TEENAGE GIRL  ($34.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Home
Entertainment)
One of the best films of 2015, The Diary Of A Teenager Girl hits all sorts
of indie-cool buttons: blunt sexuality, graphic novel teen artist, animatedflourishes, statutory rape/molestation/first love (depending on who is
doing the telling), drug use, San Francisco in the 1970s. If it hadn'tDVDs: Excellent "Diary;" "Downton's" Finale Available Now and Good "Checkers"</p>
<p>debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, one would struggle to wonder
why. Toss in a female helmer -- director Marielle Heller making an
impressive debut from her own screenplay (based on the novel by
Phoebe Gloeckner) -- and you've got a perfect storm of hipness. But themovie is much better than those details, rising above the indie film clichesto craft a piercing and very well acted look at a teenager finding release
from a pretty screwed up situation via her art. Bel Powley is just
sensational as Minnie, the 15 year old daughter of a single mom (KristenWiig, okay) who flirts with and starts to sleep with her mom's hunky 30year boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgård, also excellent). It's
intriguing how often people who are taken advantage of/molested/raped
by an older person hesitate or can't or won't call what happened what itis; they don't want to be a victim. (See the very good memoir My Father,
The Pornographer  by Chris Offutt for another example of this.) Sexual
abuse is confusing if for no other reason that at some terrible to admit
level, it can be physically pleasing and validating to the person beingabused. I think The Diary Of A Teenage Girl captures this complexity very
well and better than most any other film I've seen. It manages to not
whitewash what happened without turning the abuser into a stock villainor downplaying the emotions and personal growth of the abused. For me,
the key moment was when Monroe is looking at the comics Minnie has
been drawing and sees one where she is going down on a penis, ahugely enlarged Crumb-like image that is grotesque and amusing in anawful way. "Are these supposed to be sexy?" he wonders aloud. Um, no
they're not because what's happening is not sexy, as much as the sexual
aspect of it can be confusingly positive. Which makes the movie soundlike a drag. It's funny, bold, distressing and never timid in showing you
Minnie's life and letting you make up your own mind. Powley and
Skarsgård are really good together in what must have been a veryawkward dance. I can't wait to see what director Marielle Heller doesnext.</p>
<p>DOWNTON ABBEY SEASON 6  ($59.99 BluRay; PBS)
SHOW ME A HERO  ($49.99 BluRay; HBO)
DA VINCI'S DEMONS SEASON THREE  ($54.99 BluRay; Starz/Anchor
Bay)
FALLING SKIES THE COMPLETE SERIES  ($139.99 BluRay; Warner
Home Entertainment)
BANSHEE THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON  ($49.99 BluRay; HBO
Studios)
No, I'm not going to spoil the finale of Downton Abbey ; I'm not a
barbarian, after all. Standards must be maintained, even as the Crawley
begrudgingly must acknowledge the changing times and dismiss the thirdparlour maid on the left as a sign of economizing. I've never been a bigfan of the show; it's a very poor man's Upstairs Downstairs  and the silly
soapy fun of season one devolved into banality as plot lines were tossedabout and repeated with abandon and characters behaved idiotically andso on. Nonetheless, for a moment in the final season, the first few
episodes achieved a certain level of sanity and promised a good ending.
(In an episode that already aired, it was a treat to see Carson and Mrs.Patmore attempt to discuss marital relations, for example.) Then of
course Hugh Bonneville began spewing blood like a scene from Monty
Python and the show will I fear descend again into nonsense. I am certainthat after being put through the ringer that fans will be pleased with how itall ends. If you can't wait to find out, well, the final episodes including the
Christmas special are there just waiting for you.
I watched Oscar Isaac in Star Wars: The Force Awakens  and suddenly
realized, Oh, he's not a movie star! At least, not in the action hero/comic</p>
<p>book vein. He is of course a terrific actor, but like the Seventies icons he
doubtlessly admires -- Pacino, De NIro, Hackman -- Isaac belongs in
dramas and comedies of an intelligent sort, not blockbusters that need acertain larger than life swagger. This isn't a criticism, just a comment on
the sort of actor he is. If you want proof of how good he can be, check
out the critically acclaimed HBO miniseries Show Me A Hero. It's aboutthe true story of the youngest big city mayor in America (Isaacs) whofinds his town of Yonkers torn apart when Isaac must enforce a federal
court order and build some low income housing. De Niro and Pacino
would approve. (But good lord, does a miniseries set in the late 80s andearly 90s count as a period piece? God help me.)
Da Vinci's Demons  never got much love. Some fans expected Leonardo to
be a gay or bisexual hero when that's hardly necessary for historical
accuracy in a show that includes fantasy elements. (Check out Black
Sails, by the way.) The first two seasons had the sort of arcs one expects
from dramas of this sort and were silly fun to a degree. But the third andfinal season has been bolloxed in every way. The decision to end a showshould if at all possible come early enough for the creators to craft a
finale that will work. In this case, the focus on the Book Of Leaves (the
driving element of the show) disappeared while Da Vinci and friends fightoff the Turks. Though it has ten episodes just like season two, the finalefeels rushed, confusing and deeply unsatisfying. It was never going to be
great, but at least it could have resulted in an ending that satisfied the
people who actually watched.
In stark contrast, the sci-fi drama Falling Skies  ends on a strong note,
giving Noah Wylie two long-running dramas to his credit. The five
seasons of this show tell one complete and entertaining story. Aliensinvade earth, harvesting kids for some unknown but obviously nefarious
purpose. Humans ban together (after 90% of the population has been
killed off) and fight back. Wylie is Tom, a leader of the resistance and it allbuilds to a climax that explains everything and provides the much-
needed closure folk need both in romance and TV serial dramas. If you're
wondering whether to commit to this 52 episode sci-fi show, watch thefirst few -- if you like it, rest assured the rest will hold up. The boxed setcomes with some fine extras but I especially enjoy the compact box and
presentation.
Now can we get some cult series love for Banshee ? Cinemas is HBO's
little brother. HBO has often had some shows that run and run, despite
modest to no attention. (I'm looking at you, Arliss .) Now here Cinemax
has a fun drama that deserves a lot more love but hasn't received it. The
fourth and final season begins in April and if the quality can be
maintained, this one will be another keeper you can binge watch happily.</p>
<p>But wouldn't you rather be the one to have already seen the show, the
one to tell others they've been missing out? The story features a con on
the run who assumes the identity of a smalltown sheriff. he's been tryingto win back the daughter of a gangster who wants him dead. But she's
got a new identity as well. It's complicated, tense, funny and most
definitely off-beat. And Antony Starr is a star in the making.</p>
<p>BRIDGE OF SPIES  ($39.99 BluRay; Walt Disney Studios)
CHI-RAQ  ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)
THE ASSASSIN  ($29.98 BluRay; Well Go USA Entertainment)
THE INTERN  ($35.99 BluRay; Warner Home Entertainment)
THE NEW GIRL FRIEND  ($34.98 BluRay; Cohen Media Group)
A clutch of films that don't work but are fascinating failures in one way or
another. Steven Spielberg is a great director whose major work -- likemost artists -- came during a 13 year span. (I'm thinking of Jaws  through
Empire Of The Sun ). He can deliver some very good movies after that, but
the inspired burst of creativity that made his name is there. Bridge ofSpies is one of his notably weaker efforts, despite the inexplicable Oscarlove. Tom Hanks plays a lawyer somehow dragooned into negotiatingwith East Germany for the exchange of prisoners during the height of the
Cold War. Being an aw shucks Good Guy, Hanks becomes determined
not to sacrifice a minor pawn (some young guy in love who snuck over thewall) just to secure the much needed return of a man in uniform. Among
the low points: the godawful shot of East Germans gunned down while
attempting to climb the wall contrasted with the shot of kids in Americaclimbing fences from one backyard to another. We get it! Also, the
dreadful score by the often excellent Thomas Newman, who almost
seemed to be punishing Spielberg for the absence of John Williams. Thesole high point: Mary Rylance, doing such subtle quiet work as a Germanspy I'm flabbergasted (but delighted) that the Academy recognized it.
I was all down for Spike Lee's Chi-Raq . A modern retelling of the Greek
comedy Lysistrata ? Set in Chicago, with women sick of the endless cycle
of violence demanding their money stop killing each other and get rid of
their guns? With musical flourishes? Done in rhyming dialogue? And the</p>
<p>slogan "No Peace, No Piece"? I'm in. Sadly, Lee was not. I loved the
roughly half an hour of the film that strove for the delirious and hilarious
premise of this movie. But too often, Lee stopped to deliver a publicservice announcement. It's passionate and sincere and much-needed,
but it doesn't make for very good drama. John Cusack (so good in Love &
Mercy) is burdened with a costume that would be fine if his character wascorrupt or buffoonish but just laughable when he's intended to besympathetic and sincere. (He delivers a passionate, tiresome sermon at a
funeral for the death of a child.) Teyonah Parris is wonderfully charismatic
as Lysistrata and Nick Cannon is almost her equal as the rapper Chi-Raq.Samuel L. Jackson is a hoot as the narrator and I pray he demanded tokeep those suits he's sporting. The fun bits are very fun indeed. Well
worth getting so you can fast forward to the good stuff but far from what
it might have been. I wish Lee had been more Preston Sturges here andless Stanley Kramer.
I suppose The Assassin  is exactly what one would expect from a martial
arts extravaganza from director Hou Hsiao-Hsien. On one level, it's utterly
inexplicable. On another level, it's transfixingly gorgeous. Do NOT watch
this for lots of action a la Crouching Tiger. Do watch it for it's beautiful
pageantry.
Old people (which Hollywood considers to be anyone over 40, but here
means the 72 year actor Robert De Niro) can be sources of wisdom,
valuable mentors? Great! He and Anne Hathaway have fun chemistry inThe Intern  as a retired man looking for some purpose while she's a
career-driven gal who needs to learn what's really important in life. Too
bad director Nancy Myers strays far from this premise to waste a lot of
time with Hathaway's private life. And if being older is something tocelebrate, why is Linda Lavin played as a gorgon when expressing
interest in De Niro? (He runs in horror even though she's just six years
older than him while embracing Renee Russo, who is eleven yearsyounger.) I suppose we should be grateful he didn't end up datingHathaway.
Director François Ozon is one of the bright lights of French cinema.
Romain Duris is clearly one of its best young actors. Somehow they bothbungle -- with the best of intentions - the story of a widowed father who
discovers a penchant for cross dressing. (Those straight guys! So
adorable.) I think the suspect here is, in part, a not terribly goodtranslation in the subtitles, since French-speaking friends explained a few
nuances I missed. However, the overall tone is skittish, veering from
sweet to schtick rather unconvincingly. The New Girl Friend  doesn't work,
but the talent of all involved makes it somewhat watchable.</p>
<p>GOOSEBUMPS  ($38.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Home Entertainment)
SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS ($36.99 BluRay; Walt Disney
Home Entertainment)
KUNG FU PANDA 1 and 2  ($14.95 each on DVD; Dreamworks
Animation)
Family fun on tap! Personally, I don't consider any entertainment worthy
of a kid's attention unless it can hold my attention too. Mind you, a littlejunk food is fine when it comes to books, if not food. I'd consider theGoosebumps
 books to be pretty disposable fun. The long-running series</p>
<p>by R.L. Stine offers silly but genuine chills with the comfort of knowing
the terror is of the modest variety. They're readable though once you've
read two or three you've pretty much read them all. He turned outhundreds of titles and now it's become a movie. The reasonable premise
is that the dreamt-up terrors of Stine actually come to life and he has to
save the world. Jack Black plays the writer with just the right sort ofnebbishy flair and it's good to see him with a family friendly franchise. (Ilike to see an actor get their payday when they consistently do interesting
smaller projects.) In many ways, it's a modest improvement on the books
and could get even better for given the box office, a sequel is assured.
You certainly can't go wrong with the landmark animated film Snow White
And The Seven Dwarfs.  (J.R.R. Tolkien always fumed that it should be
"dwarves" and that linguist would know.) It is a gorgeous looking movie,beautifully hand-crafted before computerized animation was an optionand deserves every accolade. However, it must be said that the leads are
rather bland; all the fun here is in the margins. Yet when the margins
include said dwarves, that's not bad. All Disney films get re-releasedregularly, usually with some modest new extras to make it "new" and the
same is true here. If you own a recent edition, you're fine. If you don't, by
all means pony up. It will always remain an important film, though I'd rankit below Bambi  and Pinocchio  in terms of early Disney greats.
If you're smart, you'll head to the cinema to see Kung Fu Panda 3  to see
state of the art animation. This movie was made in cooperation with aChinese studio and that seemed a business decision to gain easieraccess to the Chinese market. But Dreamworks Animation used this
opportunity to have a genuine artistic collaboration. The result is a film
that feels more authentically Asian than the first, with the kung fu andChinese philosophy moving from window dressing to front and center
without spoiling any of the fun. Plus the 3-D is excellent and well worth it
for once. You'll be reminded how good the first two films were. And herethey are in very inexpensive DVD versions, timed to the release of the newmovie.The first one is great, the second one good and the third might just
be the best of all, complete with some very striking animation. Uncle Walt
would be proud.</p>
<p>EDGE OF SEVENTEEN  ($27.99 BluRay; Strand Releasing)
FREEHELD  ($39.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)
HOW TO WIN AT CHECKERS (EVERY TIME)  ($24.95 DVD; Wolfe Video)
Edge Of Seventeen  has a bittersweet edge on many levels. Released in
1998, it is set in the summer of 1984. Now we're watching it in 2016, so
it's nostalgic on two levels. (There should be a word for that.) Notably well
reviewed as a gay teen coming of age comedy/drama, it's also proven tobe by far the most notable credit for most involved, from Chris Stafford as
the questioning hero to Anderson Gabrych to both the writer and director.
They all display talent so of course anything could happen in the future.But knowing this was their one stab at glory and they made the most of itis poignant. The only one to capitalize was Tina Holmes as the best friend,
who has gone on to solid work in TV especially. You know or can guess
the premise: Stafford plays the cutie wearing amusing (but never kitschy)80s clothing with impeccable style. His best pal Holmes clearly has a
crush on him...but who is that hot busboy at the theme park they're
working at? It's not groundbreaking but as a time capsule within a timecapsule, it's pretty fun.
Freeheld  starts at a much higher level and so falls farther. It's based on
the Oscar winning documentary short about a police officer who is dying
and wants to leave benefits to her female lover back in the day whenmarriage was not an option. Julianne Moore and Ellen Page star as the
two women and they have good chemistry. Unfortunately the good
intentions and noble purpose of the movie get in the way of anythingapproaching genuine drama and surprise almost every step of the way.</p>
<p>The leads are the only reason to see it and not quite enough at that. Still,
it's a happy reminder of how far we've come and how far there still is to
go.
Who knows how the Bangkok-set film How To Win At Checkers (Every
Time)  will hold up 20 years from now? But chances are this look at a
young man coming of age with sexuality just one element of the film's
ambitious screenplay will hold up well. I often find gay films from other
countries are illuminating: you can almost pinpoint what era they seemstuck in even when set in the current day. (That is, a film from onecountry might seem like they're where the US was in the 1950s while
another seems set in the 1970s and a lucky few even ahead of us.) This
one is only marginally about queers, with gay and transgender and thesex workers woven into the tale realistically, rather than as the tawdrytrappings they often are for stories set in Bangkok. The main story
focused on a young man in love who hopes to escape the dreaded army
draft and how his little 11 year old brother gets swept up in the danger.
Those looking for a gay-centric tale will be disappointed, but it's a
promising feature debut for writer-director Josh Kim after a string ofdocumentary and fiction shorts.
