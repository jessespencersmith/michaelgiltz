10/04/2004 10:23:00 AMBush doesn't hate corruption or graft or cover-ups that waste our taxdollars and endanger national security. Nope, he hates the braveAmericans -- aka "whistleblowers" -- who risk everything to exposethese problems. The New York Times reports on Congress actuallydoing something good...and Bush trying to stop them. The first fewgraphs pretty much say it all:"Over strenuous objections from the Bush administration, Congress ismoving to increase protections for federal employees who exposefraud, waste and wrongdoing inside the government."Lawmakers of both parties say the measures are needed to preventretaliation against such whistleblowers, who reveal threats to publichealth, safety and security."But the administration says the bill unconstitutionally interferes withthe president's ability to control and manage the government."Why does Bush hate brave Americans?
