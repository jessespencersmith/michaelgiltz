BookFilter: The Wall Street Scandal "Black Edge," The
Woman Who Defied George Washington & More
02/07/2017 01:17 am ET
Hey Book Lovers!  Welcome to our latest  Top Picks Of The Week !  (Subscribe to our free weekly newsletter 
here! ) We admit it -- everything makes us think of great books. Last Sunday was the Super Bowl and any 
comment about football made us say, "Have you read this nutty but moving novel called 'The Throwback 
Special?' " It's about a group of guys who get together every year to reenact one of the most crushing plays in 
NFL history. Seriously."  Or we might have pulled a quarterback sneak and said, "What do you think of the NCAA?"...just so we could add, "There's a great new book called 'Unwinding Madness'  that Bob Costas 
blurbed about; it explains why college sports is broken and how to fix it. Check it out!" Try to change the topic
 
by saying next Sunday is the Grammys and we'd respond, "Oh, this terrific new memoir from the UK is about a classical pianist who overcame childhood abuse and mental illness to become a best-selling artist. You have to read "Instrumental!"  So yeah, we love books. If you do too, whether you're about to go to your 
favorite bookstore, library or online retailer, head first to BookFilter  and you'll discover all the best new 
releases in every genre.

BLACK EDGE by Sheelah Kolhatkara  
Just as oversight of the financial world is cut back, returning to the go-go days before Dodd-Frank, a staff 
writer at the New Yorker delivers this acclaimed look at the good old, bad old days when hedge funds could run amok. Billionaire Steve Cohen ran SAC Capital until the largest insider trading investigation in history put acrimp in his style. Journalist Sheelah Kolhatkar tells the story with verve, filled with excess in consumption, unprecedented stock trading success and how Cohen was revered as a genius. Then a seven year probe resulted in SAC itself pleading guilty to fraud and insider trading. But there's a happy ending! Cohen reached a settlement with the SEC on civil charges, he's worth some $13 billion and he can start investing in other people's money again in 2018.... Read More.

<p>A BOOK OF AMERICAN MARTYRS by Joyce Carol Oates  Author Joyce Carol Oates is so prolific it's obvious 
we'll need a generation just to figure out exactly how good she is and where she ranks. (At least, that's our 
excuse for not having read everything she's written. :) She's delivered short stories, mysteries, Gothic tales, essays, criticism and fiction focused on race and violence at the heart of America. Now she tackles abortion. Oates displays insight into both sides by creating a born again Evangelical who assassinates an idealistic doctor that provided abortions. But she doesn't stop there, observing the fallout of this act of violence on both
 
the man who committed it and the wife and children he left bereft and bitter by doing so.... Read More.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LAURA INGALLS WILDER!  Yoko Ono taught us that it's more fun to celebrate 
someone's life on the day they were born rather than the day they died. But with Laura Ingalls Wilder,  we 
don't have to choose. She was born on February 7, 1867 and died almost exactly 90 years to the day on 
February 10, 1957. And yes, she was born in a little house in the big woods (of Pepin, Wisconsin, to be exact).  
Writers  Roxanne Gay  and Ayelet Waldman  both gave deserved props to Wilder recently in the New York 
Times column By The Book. Don't hesitate to dive back into the Little House series -- it reads just as charmingly when you're an adult as it did when you were a kid. Or you can find Wilder playing a fascinating supporting role in "The Book That Changed America,"  a new work of popular history about Darwin's "On The 
Origin Of Species."

YOU ARE THE UNIVERSE by Deepak Chopra and Menas Kafatos  We think of BookFilter as akin to an 
independent bookstore, always displaying the most interesting and popular new releases in every genre. (But 
we don't actually sell books so you can take our enthusiasm to the bank.) We want you to be able to find the</p>
<p>books you want, discover the books you didn't know about and learn to trust our taste and personal quirks. 
Our choices should have a little...personality. But some things just aren't up our alley, like New Age titles. So if  
you're a fan of Deepak Chopra and the idea of him pairing with a physicist to discuss questions like "Do We Live In A Conscious Universe?" and "Where Did Time Come From?" appeals, well dive in and let us know what you think. We're always ready to be convinced a book we wouldn't normally pick up is worth our time.... Read More.

ABC PASTA by Juana Medina Rosas  Picture books about the alphabet are a perennial. No surprise since kids  
will always need to learn their letters. What is surprising is how inventive and clever those picture books can 
be. Year after year they find new angles on "A is for..." that you'd never imagine. Take this pasta-obsessed entry, which uses real pasta to form the core of their images for pronouncements like "A is for angel hair acrobat" and "M is for Macaroni the Magician" and so on. Perfect for new parents who are foodies and the chef in your life (kids or no kids). You just know some people have collections devoted to alphabet picture books from around the world and we totally get it.... Read More.

<p>NEVER CAUGHT by Erica Armstrong Dunbar  This is the sort of popular history that makes you sit up and say, 
"I can't believe I never heard about this before!" Just as he was nearing the end of his Presidency, George 
Washington found himself in a politically awkward, personally angering situation: one of his slaves had run away. Here's the story of Ona Judge, an enslaved woman who took the mighty risk of fleeing the home of the most powerful man in the United States and defiantly said she'd rather die than go back to a life under his thumb. Historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar combines Judge's personal testimony with the copious letters and personal journals kept by George Washington, Martha and many others. So Dunbar is able to flesh out Judge's life and situation more fully than usual for people who managed to survive the horrors of slavery. She combines specific details with the historical record to show the world Judge lived in and the vagaries and psychological terror of life even under a "good" slave owner. Washington most assuredly saw himself that way
 
and simply couldn't understand why  Judge would be so ungrateful as to flee being his property.... Read More.

<p>ECHOES IN DEATH by J.D. Robb  Even as we type this comment, we know that somewhere author Nora 
Roberts is typing away, faster than we can keep up. She's published more than 200 novels, sold more than 
500 million copies of her books and still they come. She pens mysteries under the pen name of J.D. Robb just to keep them all straight. Set in the near future, these sci-fi-ish procedurals combine romance and beyond cutting edge technology to tell their noirish tales. Eve Dallas is a NY Lt. who fights crime and in this 44th installment she's just married her billionaire boyfriend. (Wouldn't you?) That doesn't stop crime and it doesn't stop Eve Dallas from investigating.... Read More.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHARLES DICKENS  You love Charles Dickens.  Of course you do. I mean, we're all sane
 
people who love books and if you love reading you love Dickens. Sure, maybe some of you will insist that 
Anthony Trollope is the true  giant of the 19th century Victorian novel, but it's not like you'd say Dickens is 
terrible, right? But there's a problem. Dickens was born on February 7, 1812 (the same day as Laura Ingalls Wilder) and apparently he started writing inside the womb  because the guy wrote a LOT. We're crazy about 
Dickens and yet we haven't even read all of his 15 novels. "A Tale Of Two Cities"  may be his most popular 
book (indeed, it may be the best-selling novel of all time). But we haven't read it. (Maybe it's the movie versions we've seen? It just doesn't feel Dickensian  to us, somehow. Is that even possible?) And his first work 
"The Pickwick Papers? " Haven't read that yet, either. What Dickens book have you  not read? Yet, that is. 
"Great Expectations?" Really?!?! Shock and delight us by admitting the truth in an email to newsletter@bookfilter.com.  We'll treat it like the confessional, unless of course you're really witty or wise and 
then we'll share it in a future newsletter.

<p>THE RULER'S GUIDE by Chinghua Tang  Remember when Sun Tzu's "The Art Of War" became all the rage in 
business circles and self-help fans? That could happen again with "The Ruler's Guide," a decidedly more 
pacific and generous offering of wisdom. Its goal is not to defeat your enemies but work better with those around you. Based on the copious writing left behind during the reign of Tang Taizong, China's greatest emperor, it shows how he was the rare conqueror who was also a great bureaucrat and steady hand for the empire he'd built. It includes truisms, the debates among his advisers that Tang encouraged, philosophical advice, practical suggestions and more. Apparently, it's been a business leader bible throughout Asia for centuries. Now, finally, "The Ruler's Guide" has been translated into English.... Read More.

<p>AUTUMN by Ali Smith  
We're still recovering from the genius that was Jane Smiley's trilogy of books dubbed "The Last One Hundred 
Years," which covered about a century of US history, with one chapter per year from the early 1900s into the near future. Now here comes Britain's Ali Smith with a quartet of novels based upon the seasons. The friendship of a young London academic and her 101 year old one-time neighbor is just one strand in this opening salvo titled "Autumn." Smith has been compared to everyone from James Salter and Virginia Woolf. If
 
you've heard about her but never taken the plunge, now is the time.... Read More.
