PLAYWRIGHTS  HORIZON
I've never worked at a movie theater but I'm enough of a cinema buff to realize the appeal
for a summer or two, especially at a multiplex. You can gorge on movies, seeing the reallygood ones multiple times in between the annoying bother of sweeping up trash andtearing tickets. Movie fanatic Avery (the excellent Aaron Clifton Moten) has higherstandards. He goes to work at a rundown one-screen movie theater in the summer of 2012because it's one of the last in Massachusetts that still shows 35 mm films instead of digital
projection.
In Annie Baker's sweet, sad new play, it's no surprise Avery finds himself surrounded by
oddballs, including green-haired projectionist Rose (Louisa Krause) and the older Sam(Matthew Maher). For Avery, this is just a fill-in job. For Rose and Sam, working at thisdilapidated palace is what they do. They might want to vet Avery and make sure he's coolenough, but the fact is that Sam and Rose are so lonely that any new face, any newpossibility for friendship and a way to beat the boredom of their work is too precious topass up. They soon befriend Avery, let him in on the "tradition" of skimming a littlemoney from the till and splitting it three ways and battle each other for his attention.
Not to worry because Avery fits right in. He's an odd duck, clearly a sad and awkward guy
with an encyclopedic knowledge of cinema. In one of the play's best scenes, he and Samare cleaning out the theater while Sam tries to stump him with the Six Degrees game
where you link two actors via as few films as possible. With his nerdy smarts, quiet smile
and affable if awkward nature, the shy Avery proves an ideal addition to the group andRose is soon angling for a date, even though we know Sam really likes her a lot.
The scenic and costume design by David Zinn is impeccable. The audience comes into the
theater and sees rows of movie seats and a projectionist booth through a glass window inthe back. It looks like a movie theater that was last renovated about 1982. As the actorsstroll the aisles, sweeping up popcorn kernels and the like, the sense of peeking into theirworkaday existence is complete. The lighting by Jane Cox and sound design by Bray Poor(which includes snippets of actual films scores, I assume, since there is no composercredit) also contribute to capturing the drudgery.May 6, 2014

<p>However, the intentional flabbiness of the early part of this three-hour play eventually
gives way to some unintentional flabbiness by the end. We don't need three hours tocapture the dullness of their job; Baker, her excellent cast and director Sam Gold do thatvery efficiently. And we don't need an entirely new character added in towards the end tono effect (Alex Hanna) or a drawn-out finale that doesn't even give Rose her due. Further,Avery is burdened with all sorts of drama in his backstory: he's suicidal, has a mother whoabandoned him and is almost autistic in his inability to respond to physical intimacy. It'sfar too much when simply his love of movies was enough to motivate Avery to spend the
summer at the theater and his nerdy loneliness was enough to let him fit in. Despite this
drama overload, Moten is subtle and memorable throughout.
So it has flaws. (Who hasn't seen a Hollywood movie in the last few years and
immediately suggested cuts?) But it also has three very good actors and some winningdialogue. Maher is one of the treats of the New York theater scene. Like a Warner Bros.character actor who appears in film after film in key turns, Maher has a distinctive voiceand style you always welcome. But he's also deceptively versatile, covering comedy anddrama and tragedy with aplomb, playing both the very smart and the very dumb with skilland heart. His scene declaring his love to Rose is one of the more affecting of the year so
far. In the least distinctive part, Krause manages to create a quirky, real person from the
standard rebellion of Rose, mining her deadpan demeanor for laughter, doing a nuttydance that rightly draws applause and beautifully dealing with some awkward moments offrustrated intimacy. When Rose is missing from the final scenes, it feels wrong.
I don't need a happy ending. In fact, I kind of wanted The  Flick  to end before one final
exchange between Avery and Sam. I think that would have been truer to the transitory
nature of these sorts of jobs and the sad fate for Sam, to whom this job is a career. Butone thing is clear: Annie Baker has found her career and it's one to watch with eagerness.
P.S. Macaulay Culkin to Michael Caine? Macaulay Culkin to Daniel Stern in Home  Alone.
Daniel Stern to Michael Caine in Hannah  And  Her  Sisters.
DETROIT  '67  ** 1/2
PUBLIC  THEATER
Like The  Flick,  the new drama Detroit  '67  is by a talented playwright, in this case
Dominique Morisseau. Both pieces have their flaws ( The  Flick  is a little too ungainly and
long; Detroit  '67  a little too conventional in its storyline). But both artists have created
vivid characters we want to spend time with and both are rewarded by excellent casts that
bring those characters to life. The writers may have room to grow in terms of structure,but when you can bring people to life, actors will flock to perform your work and you'llfind the opportunities you need to work and refine and reach greatness.
Obviously, Detroit  '67  takes place in Detroit right before the city exploded in anger after
too much police brutality and racism. It's usually called the Detroit Riots though
Morisseau prefers The Great Rebellion.
But rebellion is not fomenting in the home of Chelle (Michelle Wilson) and her brother</p>
<p>Lank (Francois Battiste). They certainly had socially conscious parents who encouraged
these people to be free thinkers and decorate their basement with art, including Chelle's
modern art-like graphic designs, Lank's (short for Langston as in Hughes) drawing of hissister and their dad's black power fist, not to mention posters and photos of iconic blackfigures like Malcolm X and Diana Ross. Chelle and Lank run an after-hours joint that isopening up for business again. Chelle wants to play it safe with their legacy, the homethey own and the money they have socked away. She wants a stable home for her sonstudying at Tuskegee.
Lank has bigger dreams, exemplified by the massive 8-track machine he and best buddy
Sly (a very good Brandon J. Dirden) have just purchased. Yes, their record player keepsskipping and the 8-track player will make them stand out from the competition. ButChelle is not surprised when she hears the real reason for the purchase: Lank wants tospend their inheritance on acquiring a local bar so they can go legit. That 8-track playerbelongs in a bar, not a basement.
Toss in Chelle's sexy friend Bunny (De'adre Aziza) and you've got yourself a play. In fact,
the violence outside is an almost unnecessary backdrop to the struggle between Chelle andLank over playing it safe or gambling on a brighter future.
Unfortunately, we do have the riots simmering in the background and -- even moredistracting -- the wholly unconvincing plot device of Caroline (Samantha Soule), a whitegirl Lank discovers wandering down the highway in a daze, bundles into his car, bringshome, gives her shelter and demands his sister do the same. Caroline is on the run fromcrooked cops but also proves a deft bartender, one of the big draws of their social club. Sodespite the risks, Chelle allows her to stay for a little while, just long enough for Lank tofall in love.
Soule can do little with this poor excuse for a catalyst and flounders a bit in her big scene,
repeatedly slapping her hands on her side and gesticulating wildly to indicate emotion.
But the other actors fare much better, even when the story goes down its predictablepaths. Aziza has easy laughs as the earthy, blunt Bunny, having fun as she makes a half-hearted attempt at helping Chelle fold laundry. (Domesticity is not her strong suit.) She'sa type but Aziza makes her a particular type and her easy rapport with Lank is veryconvincing. Battiste holds his own among these formidable women, even as Lank mustspeechify again and again. Dirden (so good in Signature's revival of The  Piano  Lesson ) is
equally sparkling here. The scene where Sly finally gets Chelle to take him seriously as apotential romance is the quietly steamy high point of the evening.
And Wilson as Chelle is excellent. She lists only regional credits so I assume this is her
New York debut. It's an auspicious one; Wilson is vivid, intelligent, appealing and fierce as</p>
<p>Chelle. The entire cast led by director Kwame Kwei-Armah has delivered this piece in as
ideal a manner as Morisseau could hope for.
HIT  THE  WALL  *
BARROW  STREET  THEATRE
Has there ever been a great work of art inspired by Stonewall? We've had a bad indie film
or two and some other awkward plays. That trend continues with Hit  The  Wall,  a work
that came from Chicago loaded with good reviews but proves painfully cliched and tired.Somehow, mounting it just steps from where the actual riots took place that helped launch
the modern gay rights movement feels a little galling. Maybe you can do this in the
heartland, but in Greenwich Village if you want the right to tell this story you better do itbrilliantly.
Hit  The  Wall  by Ike Holter can't even settle for competent. The amateurish writing sounds
like something kids in high school would create after reading about Stonewall and wanting
to turn it into a stage play. It's earnest and painfully well-intentioned, but also obvious inevery way. A staging by director Eric Hoff that hopes to create an electric, Hair -like
experience by letting the actors bound around and improv their asses off (which must bemore fun than doing the actual dialogue) can't begin to mask the hollow nature of the
script and ultimately proves wearying.
The story hardly bears worth repeating: a gaggle of gays of varying ethnic stripes and
stages of coming out converge on Greenwich Village and are all at Stonewall the night theriots occurred. You've got your fierce drag queen, closeted businessmen, vicious cops,politically empowered lesbians of color, butch lesbians who dress like boys and of course ablond newbie who just wants to lose his virginity.
In this context, no one can give a genuinely good performance. But it's a credit to the
actors that you can believe many of them would be capable of it under bettercircumstances. Nathan Lee Graham plays Carson, the drag queen mourning the death of
Judy Garland. He's a pro who has appeared in far better works and somehow manages to
maintain his dignity here. As Peg, the mannish-dressing lesbian, Rania Salem Manganaroactually finds some quiet drama early on. Gregory Haney and Arturo Soria try but can't domuch of anything with the finger-snapping queens who sit on a stoop and talk trash allday long. Their sassiness is dialed up to 11 from the very start and rarely pauses forbreath. (And the Spanish dialogue of Soria is unfortunate pidgin Spanish, ungrammaticalnonsense so often found in plays written by people not fluent in Spanish.)
Sean Allan Krill has the funniest moments of the play as an "A-Gay," a highly desirable
straight-acting man who has a set come-on to whomever he wants to pick up that'shilariously blunt, ending with the firm declaration, "You have five seconds." But why the
play pauses mid-riot to chide him for his superficiality is beyond me; we haven't even won
basic rights and already we're criticizing each other's commitment to the cause? Andthank you to the very fit Nick Bailey as the Newbie. The scene where he stripped off hisclothes and dashed across the stage -- twice -- was unquestionably the highlight of theevening.
The actors are repeatedly asked to chant, "I was there! I was there!" but unfortunately
you're never convinced of this even for a moment.
