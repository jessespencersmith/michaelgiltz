11/05/2004 02:53:00 AMWhat a coincidence that we've decided to move on Fallujah justafter the election ends. The insurgents have been in control ofthat city and the longer we waited to attack, the longer theyhad to dig in and encourage others to join them simply bysurviving.The bombing has begun and hopefully we'll be able to subduethem quickly. (Happily, most citizens fled the city long ago. Butit's gonna be bloody.) With elections only weeks away, doesanyone think it was smart militarily to wait and wait like Bushdid? He simply wanted to hold off until after the election soAmericans wouldn't be hearing about bloody battles and(more) dead G.I.s.But that unnecessary, militarily (and politically) foolish delaymay very well mean that more of our soldiers die than wasnecessary. Here's praying it goes smoothly. Bush has plenty offiascos on the domestic front to bite him in the ass -- here'shoping Iraq doesn't get any worse.
