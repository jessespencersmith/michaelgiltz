T h" hottest couple on teen
I TV nearly broke up over
I New Year's.
Not |essica and Nick.
Drake Bell and |osh Peck, stars
of the hit Nickelodeon series
"Dmke&)osh," nearly came to
an end three weeks ago today
when a guy fell asleep at the
wheel and slammed head-on into
Drake's vintage Mustang.
The Mustang, a1966 model,
of course had no air bags and
no shoulder harness.
Suddenly, a week before their
first TV movie, "Dnke & fostt
GoTbHollywood" r,r/as set to
debut, the highest-rated show
among'tweens - that awkwardly.
named group of9- to l4-year-olds
- was in serious trouble.
"I don't have kids, but I
imagine the feeling I got when I
got the call was very much like a
parent's feeling," the show's
creator, Dan Schneider, says.
"I knew his face had been cut
pretty bad and his jaw had been
smashed," he says. "But that
stuff is cosmetic. and we all
knew we could fixthat.
"But he alsohad a slight neck
fracture, and that was what was
really scary.
"He easily could have beenkilled or found himself in a
wheelchair."
"Drake & Josh Go To
Holly'wood" aired as scheduled
last Friday to an audience ofover
5 million viewers - the biggest
thing on Nick in five years.
The series, now in its third
season, is about two high-
school classmates who know
each other only slightly - until
Drake's divorced mom and
|osh's father started dating and
eventually marry.
Suddenly the boys - Drake,
the handsome, rock-band leader
who gets all the girls, and fosh,
the exuberant, portly tag-along -
are stepbrothers and roommates.
The act is pure Dean Martin and
jerry Lewis - and it still works.
Both actors are 19 years old.
Schneider - a mini-mogul
around Nickelodeon who has
created a string of hit shows for
the network, including "Zoey
lol" and "Kenan&Kel'- built
the segies around their chenristry.
"Drake has the market comered
on cool," says Schneider.
Josh "has got this jackie
Gleason quality," he says. "Not
only can fosh do the physical
comedy and the pratfalls, but he
can also sell a soohisticated
joke and a touching moment."As is often the case,
Drake and |osh did not hit it
off right away. But things
improved when both
were cast on "The
AmandaShow."
"I walked into'The
Amanda Show,"'
remembers Josh.'And he
said,'You do comedy, huh?'
I said.'Yeah.' He said.'Tell
me a joke.'So I told him
a joke from my act, and
he laughed hysterically.
So I thought, 'He can't be
all bad if he thinks I'm
funny."'
Now they're best pals.
]osh was one of the first
people at the hospital the
day of the accident.
Drake is out of the
hospital, recovering at
home. He is sitting around
and playing his gtri1x1, t"tt
Schneider. But his jaw is
wired shut, and he is
restricted to a liquid diet
until it heals.
Plastic surgeons will take
care ofthe scar on his iaw
after that, says the producer.
Production on Season 4 of
"Drake & Josh" was halted,
but is expected to resume in
mid-March.</p>
