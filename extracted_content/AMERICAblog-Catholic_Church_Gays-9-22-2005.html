9/22/2005 02:00:00 AMIn Mexico, Bishop Ramon Godinez is ignoring the pleas of thecountry's leader by insisting he has no problem with takingmoney from cruel and violent drug dealers responsible formisery and death all over the hemisphere."If they have money, they have to spend it; I don't knowwhy such a scandal has been made of this," Godinez said ina follow-up interview with the Televisa television networkTuesday...."Let me explain: We live on this, on the offerings of thefaithful.So it wasn't just a one-time slip of the tongue. The bishop said it,said it again, and can't figure out why people are upset. Exactly howcould an unrepentant drug dealer be considered "one of the faithful?"As John posted below, back in the US, a grand jury condemns thePhilly archdiocese:The Philadelphia Archdiocese concealed sexual abuseby Roman Catholic priests for four decades, a grandjury has found, but no criminal charges can be broughtagainst the church or its clergy because of the limits ofstate law....The report names 63 priests "whose abusive behaviorwas well-documented in archdiocese files and bywitnesses who testified" before the grand jury.Finally, a UN prosecutor says the Vatican is hiding a Croatian warcriminal indicted for crimes against humanity in a monastery. TheChurch says "Prove it." How low can the Church sink?
