It's a poorly made fictional film using animalsto tell a fake story. (At least in the rest of the world. For the US, theyslapped on some embarrassing, unscientific gobbledygook aboutpenguins that often ignores what's happening right in front of oureyes.) For other duds, scroll down to the bottom.THE BEST MOVIES OF 2005The Best of Youth – a six hour Italian miniseries that spans decadesto cover politics and business and terrorism and love. And life. Whichonly sounds dorky before you’ve become caught up in the lives of agroup of characters you get to know almost as well as your best friends.Shot for TV, so its visual flair is limited.

Adapting the novel by Scott Heimpushed Araki to be very disciplined when telling the story of two kidswho are molested by a baseball coach. One descends into prostitution(almost a legal requirement for troubled gay youth in the movies) andthe other blocks it out completely, ultimately convincing himself he wasabducted by aliens.
