After some time off, here (finally!) are some new releases on DVD and BluRay and the best of recentmonths that you really need.THE ROOSEVELTS: AN INTIMATE HISTORY ($129.99 BluRay; PBS) -- Have you been taking director KenBurns for granted? I have. It's been a while since I've been truly jazzed by one of his projects, however worthyand however sturdily made. But here we are again: the camera zooming in or pulling out on an old photograph,the well-considered voice-over, the expert talking heads who make history come alive. As the show aired onPBS, random friends and acquaintances kept telling me almost in surprise how captivated they were by this lookat the one family that gives political dynasties a good name. It reached a peak with the section on EleanorRoosevelt; everyone was reminded anew how fascinating she was. I was reminded anew of what a masterfulfilmmaker Burns has always been.A HARD DAY'S NIGHT ($39.99 BluRay combo; Criterion)  RED RIVER ($49.99 BluRay combo; Criterion) -- I've reviewed movies and TV shows on VHS tape, laser disc,DVD and now BluRay. One constant has always been the Criterion label, a sign of unquestioned quality and theinnovator in elaborate boxed sets and commentary and other extras that have become commonplace for themost pedestrian works. Of course, when Criterion does it they do it right and it's almost always a movie worthyour time. Anyone who didn't get to see A Hard Day's Night when it was reissued in movie theaters a fewmonths ago should jump on this set. Or maybe the current tributes to George Harrison centered around his newboxed set have sparked your interest. Happily, A Hard Day's Night is not a curio or time capsule or just adocument of a great band at the peak of its powers. It's a brash, bold work of art that astonishes even now, eventhough it has been so influential that you've seen everything here a thousand times before any time you watch amusic video or backstage concert film. It's just so much better here, including the fact that the band had createdan album that's so remarkably good. And the extras are almost absurdly copious, including multipledocumentaries and shorts. The classic western Red River is restrained only in comparison. It's a rousing gem,one of the perfect films to show people who think they'll never like a John Wayne film. He's terrific here and thecontrast between old school Wayne and the magnetic Montgomery Clift is a thrill all its own. This is the moviethat was playing the final night of the movie house in The Last Picture Show. That film's director PeterBogdanovich is all over this set, along with commentaries and other extras including a paperback edition of thenovel it's based on. Criterion never disappoints.THE BOB NEWHART SHOW COMPLETE COLLECTION ($129.99 DVD; Shout! Factory) WELCOME BACK KOTTER COMPLETE COLLECTION ($129.99 DVD; Shout! Factory) -- The floodgates areopening on classic TV shows and they're doing it right. Instead of dribbling out single season sets, studios arefinally giving fans what they want: complete boxed sets. Of course, it's only happening now because the DVDmarket is slipping away and studios know it's now or never. Luckily, boutique labels like Shout! Factory are hereto do it right. They follow in the wake of pioneers like Criterion and present their offerings with care. I was mostexcited by The Bob Newhart Show, the 1970s gem I've always had a fond spot for. Watching the series all atonce however is a very different experience instead of week after week. Like The Barney Miller Show, I'vereluctantly had to downgrade it from one of the absolute best to a very good sitcom. Don't get me wrong: it's far</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=643d161a-4abc-485e-874d-dfaf7c97b69c&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&2/3better than most sitcoms in history and Newhart remains an absolute delight. But week to week, it doesn't havequite the growth or inventiveness to mark it out. And to be sure, so many more shows have come out since thenthat it's quite naturally slipped a little lower on the list. I'll take it any day over Newhart, his very successful seriesthat followed. And any scene with Newhart on the phone is a masterclass in comedy. I don't have to downgradeWelcome Back Kotter because even as a kid I knew it was pretty thin stuff. Watching it now, it's kind of amazingthe show was such a phenomenon. Like Happy Days and others, it had adults in their 20s pretending to be kidsin high school, a weird situation in retrospect. The humor is banal in the extreme and barely tolerable. Thesaving grace is comic Gabe Kaplan (and that theme song). Just like all those years ago, I looked forward to hislong stories about relatives and the way his sexy, understanding wife (Marcia Strassman) would smile and sitback and enjoy whenever Kaplan broke into one of his monologues. Both sets have enough care and attentionlavished on them to keep fans happy indeed.HALLOWEEN THE COMPLETE COLLECTION BLURAY DELUXE ($169.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay) -- Do yousee a theme here? Fans are finally getting what they want -- definitive boxed sets that pull together all (or almostall) of the various cuts and extras that have proliferated over the years, especially with a franchise likeHalloween that has bounced around numerous studios. Fanatics will welcome various permutations like a cutmade for TV of one edition and a producer's cut of another and so on. I appreciate their now rare decision togive each film its own case. I'll take that over the folding cardboard monsters that most multi-disc sets seem toinspire. While I don't have enough older versions to do a thorough comparison, the original film by director JohnCarpenter looks and sounds terrific and still creeps you out. Impressively thorough.THE LAST OF THE UNJUST ($39.98 BluRay; Cohen Media Group) -- Director Claude Lanzmann'sdocumentary Shoah is one of the towering works of art. It's no wonder Lanzmann has spent the rest of hiscareer returning again and again to the work of his masterpiece, turning this and that section about theHolocaust into stand-alone works. Here we have a Lanzmann's penetrating look at the last leader of the Jews ata vile "model ghetto" set up by the Nazis. The situation is remarkably complex, as one might imagine, and I havefriends and scholars of the Holocaust who think at the end Lanzmann swallowed whole a highly questionableact. My full review can be found here. Suffice to say that it's very compelling and at least let's this leader makehis case in full. You can debate it, you can wonder what you might have done under the circumstances and forthe sake of history we have his side of the story. For me, it was easily one of the best films of 2013.LOCKE ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) -- An entire film set in a car? It's a stunt but the best sort of stunt. The storyfollows Locke as he spends 80 minutes in his car heading to a hospital for the birth of his childhood by an ex-lover. When not addressing the ghost of his father, Locke is juggling phone calls about medical emergencies,rather curious ones from his wife (where exactly is he going?) and frantic messages from work that he hasabandoned. It's compelling and fascinating as much for the constraints the film places on itself as for the storyitself. Best of all, it got me to give new respect to actor Tom Hardy, who has been in any number of films butnever truly impressed me till now.BILL MORRISON: THE COLLECTED WORKS 1996-2013 ($44.98 DVD; Icarus) -- For me, the most shockingdetail about this boxed set is the price: $45 (and less if on sale) for all these shorts and movies by one of thebest directors working today? No wonder the first shipments seem to have sold out immediately. (It's availabledirectly from Icarus.) Morrison is an experimental, envelope-pushing filmmaker but that might lead you to believehe's an acquired taste. Yet his movies are hypnotic and fascinating for everyone from lovers of esoterica tocasual filmgoers. His masterpiece will probably always be Decasia, a film composed of snippets of decaying filmstock that have been woven together into a hymn to the past, a celebration of life enduring against all odds andabout a million other things. But I also love The Miner's Hymns and The Great Flood and can't wait to dive intomore of the shorts and other works of his I haven't seen yet or in a long time. Time and again, Morrison takesfound footage, edits it together brilliantly, draws out a brilliant score to pair it with and the result is deeply movingand elegiac.</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=643d161a-4abc-485e-874d-dfaf7c97b69c&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&3/3TWIN PEAKS: THE ENTIRE MYSTERY ($134.99 BluRay; Paramount) -- Perhaps the nuttiest thing about TwinPeaks is that this landmark TV show has NEVER been readily available on home video or DVD or BluRay orstreaming online or in syndication...until now. Sure, you could purchase this or that Japanese edition to fill incertain gaps. But even previous boxed sets have at the least lacked the brilliant two hour pilot that launched thisenduring phenomenon. Now you get everything, including the feature film, various permutations and enoughbonus features to keep fans busy for hours. Best of all, you get the show itself, looking and sounding better thanever. Since Twin Peaks may be the most influential TV show in history in terms of visuals and sound, that's nosmall thing. You can read my celebration of the show for the Los Angeles Times here. I'd have to write a book totell you all the ideas that just watching an episode or two sparked in me. Like many, I'd suggest watching theshow as a miniseries: screen the first 17 episodes, take a break and when enough time has passed that youwon't spoil the original story arc, you can watch the rest of the episodes, the movie prequel and the extras asmuch as you want. Three more thoughts strike me as I watch it again and share it with a friend who never sawso much as a single scene of the show before. One, it's truly a soap opera with cliffhanging episodes and arelentless pleasure in teasing out information. Two, the casting of the young women was uniformly excellentwhile the casting of the young men is weak from top to bottom. Curious but true. Three, Kyle MacLachlan hasdone a lot of great work, but boy is he terrific here.Thanks for reading. Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.
