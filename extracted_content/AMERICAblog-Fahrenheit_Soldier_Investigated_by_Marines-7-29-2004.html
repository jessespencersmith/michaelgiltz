"Fahrenheit" Soldier Investigated by Marines
by Michael in New York  on 7/29/2004 04:40:00 PM
The soldier who appeared in "Fahrenheit 9/11" and said he would
refuse to return to Iraq is under preliminary investigation by the
Marines to see if this potential refusal of an order violates any
regulations and needs to be punished, according to USA Today.
Marine Lance Cpl. Abdul Henderson says he hasn't changed his mind
and now his unit faces a possible return to Iraq. Henderson says he
would go to Afghanistan because he believes that war was justified.
It's a difficult situation, but I certainly admire Henderson and, for
example, Muhammad Ali, for taking a principled stand and payingthe price here in the States rather than running to Canada as draftdodgers did in the Seventies. Mostly, I'm just glad it's an issue my
generation never had to face.
