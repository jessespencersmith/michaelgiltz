9/12/2005 09:16:00 PMJohn and Joe and Chris in Paris have torn apart the Pentagonwar rally for the farce that it clearly was -- but why should thatstop me from pitching in?John and Joe highlighted the pathetic turnout. Chris in Parisdetailed the way only pre-registered people could attend,posters were banned, everyone was urged to wear the samegovernment-distributed t-shirt, the walk path was fenced in,etc. Here's one more lovely anecdote from the WashingtonPost:One protester [of the march], Rik Silverman, 27, ofArlington said he was holding a sign that said, "Shame onYou" when a marcher leaned over the railing andpunched him in the stomach. A U.S. Park Police officerwrote a report but no arrests were made.Ah, yes. Nothing quite says "freedom" like punching out people whohappen to disagree with you. Let me add that I can't remember thelast time there was a march onto the Mall where no one took a photofrom up high to get a good look at the size of the crowd. Every photoI've seen is a street-level shot of people walking that gives you noidea whether the overall crowd is a few hundred or half a million. Sowhy is the media hiding the fact that this was a massive flop?If anyone finds a link online to a photo of the rally from above thatshows how small the crowd is, put a link in the commentary section.
