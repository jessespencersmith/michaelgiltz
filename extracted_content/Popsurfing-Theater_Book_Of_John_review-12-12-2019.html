THEATER: THE GOOD NEWS, OR AT LEAST
ONE FOURTH OF IT
THE GOSPEL OF JOHN  ** 1/2 out of ****
THE SHEEN CENTER
Have you heard the good news? Anyone tired of A Christmas Carol  on
stage or A Christmas Story marathon on TV has a new option. Actor
Ken Jennings is at the intimate black box space at The Sheen Center to
share the Gospel of John. He offers up the entire gospel in a casual,
confiding tone and it doesn't get more Christmas-y than that. Unless of
course you want to hear the Nativity Story, in which case you probably
want the Gospel of Luke (or Matthew).
For many years, actor Alec McCowen performed the Gospel of Luke as
a one-man show. He brought it thoroughly to life, painting various
apostles as specific, unique people; drawing out the humor and
compassion of Jesus and building to the awful and bloody climax. Like
John Gielgud with his Ages Of Man tribute to Shakespeare or Patrick
Stewart with the Dickens' Carol, St. Mark's Gospel was McCowen's
annuity, a show he performed and returned to again and again. When a
member of the audience once asked McCowen where she could get a
copy of the script, he said, "Any hotel room." It's a good joke but not an
honest answer. McCowen was faithful to the text but he shaped it into
drama in ways large and small.
Ken Jennings does none of that. This evening is described as
"conceived and performed" by him, but I prefer to say he's sharing it.
It's not quite a recitation, but he certainly doesn't shape the gospel into
drama. Jennings most assuredly does not bring to life a host of
characters. He stands on a lovely wooden stage, whose edge has a wavy
curve to it. That platform stands a little off the ground. Towards the
back, stage right, is a small wooden bench he moves here and there. A
simple, rough-hewn cloth curtain hangs at the back, stretching down
but never touching the stage. (The scenic design is by Charlie
Corcoran.) That's it. Jennings stands in front of the stage, makes theMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -good-news-or -at-least-one.html 2/5sign of the cross, quietly collects his thoughts and then he begins.
By deciding not to create a galaxy of characters, by not dramatizing the
gospel, Jennings subtly places the emphasis not on the stories within
but the message. He memorized the Gospel of John during tough times
and used it as a prayer. That's precisely what his recitation feels like
here, a straightforward, sincere act of communion both with the gospel
and with the audience.
That's not to say Jennings is a mere reader. His Gospel of John  is surely
theatrical, complete with lighting and sound effects. I wish his
performance had been just as committed to using every tool at his
disposal. Almost everyone but Jesus blurs into one another and usually
they sound like angry, kvetchy characters. Each outburst -- whether a
pharisee or a woman at a well or an apostle that doubts Jesus has risen
from the dead -- dims the impact of the one that follows. That creates a
wearying sameness to the many other voices found in the Gospel of
John.
Worse, every once in a while Jennings will be speaking as Jesus when
the sound design of M. Florian Staab gives his voice an echo-y, God-
like sound, just in case we don't quite grasp the fact that this Jesus of
Nazareth isn't just merely the latest in a line of prophets. For a while, I
thought this effect was going to be used to underline the moments
when Jesus declares "I Am...," a key motif of John that links back to the
voice of God that spoke to Moses from the burning bush.
I don't think that was done, but whatever the motivation for this hokey
effect's appearance, the show would be better without it. Staab's other,
more subtle touches (the sound of water, of crowds and the like) are far
more beneficial. Ditto the nice lighting of Abigail Hoke-Brady, which
suggests water lapping against the stage at certain points, paints the
backdrop with vivid color, closes in as night falls and so on. Hoke-
Brady also aids Jennings mightily at the finale with an excellent fade-
out.
Presumably director John Pietrowski wasn't going to convince
Jennings to change his approach to the text. But since Jennings wasThe Movies, Books, Theater,

popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -good-news-or -at-least-one.html 3/5happy to make use of lighting and sound, why not use all his skills as an
actor to more fully dramatize the Gospel of John? We'll have to agree to
disagree on that, as well as who wrote the Gospel in the first place.
Because of his choice, the inherent drama is lessened and the show
blurs a bit when the stories drop away and all we have are passages of
sermonizing.
Scholar Karen Armstrong makes clear in her new book The Lost Art Of
Scripture  that for most of human history, religious texts and tales
didn't come alive until they were performed. So Jennings is following
in a grand tradition. One can easily sit alone and read any one of the
four gospels in half an hour. But it's far more true to the spirit of
tradition (and perhaps to the Spirit) to do precisely what he's doing: to
share it in public with others.
