Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis stand-alone mystery from Val Mcdermid demonstrates why she's a best-selling writer around the world. In quickstrokes, McDermid brings to life two women: Maggie Blake an Oxford scholar of geopolitics (no, I'm still not quitesure what that might be) who fell hard for a high-ranking soldier during the Balkan conflict and cold case detectiveKaren Pirie. Blake believes her true love disappeared back to the Balkans to reunite with the family she imagined healready had. (It's not nearly as sad and other woman-ish as that sounds.) Blake is trying to determine the identity of askeleton found on a roof in Edinburgh. Two men handling low level work on a war crimes tribunal are looking for theleaker that might be tipping off an assassin that is killing off vicious figures from the tearing apart of Yugoslavia whoare escaping justice. It all comes together rather satisfyingly. Not that the mystery is terribly compelling or all thatimportant. What holds the attention are the characters McDermid creates, the historical backdrop she evokes and themoral complexity she illuminates. It's a solid introduction to her talents and perhaps the beginning of a series for thecapable and fascinating Pirie. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
