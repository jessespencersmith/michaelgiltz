Dancing Man
By Bob Avian With Tom Santopietro
$28, University Press of Mississippi
Out now
He’s a Broadway legend … or, he would be if he weren’t one of those talented creatures who does the
work and happily allows others to dance in the spotlight. Even in Bob Avian’s memoir, you’ll probably
remember the larger-than-life personalities he collaborated with more than you’ll remember the
choreographer himself. But he’s done it all, and theater buffs will savor his story. (Certainly, Michael Riedel
is a fan.) Avian danced in the original productions of 
West Side Story
 and 
Funny Girl.
 He then worked as a
production assistant and became friends with writer/director/producer/choreographer Michael Bennett.
Avian would have happily worked with and under Bennett for the rest of their lives if AIDS hadn’t cruelly
taken that genius away. Before that happened, they did landmark work on 
Follies
 and 
Company
. And, of
course, 
A Chorus Line
 and 
Dreamgirls
; Avian won a Tony for co-choreographing the first and producing the
second. Any doubts about Avian’s greatness ended with the work he did on his own when creating the
musical staging of 
Miss Saigon, Sunset Boulevard,
 and 
Martin Guerre
 (for which he won the Olivier). Now
retired, Avian tells his story with all the grace and precision one would expect from one of Broadway’s
best.
