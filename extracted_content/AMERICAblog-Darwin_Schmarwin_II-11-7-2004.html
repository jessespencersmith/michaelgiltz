11/07/2004 08:22:00 AMI thought David's idea of encouraging school boards toincorporate a Hindu creation myth was a great idea. Anyonegoing to one of these meetings should be armed with all sortsof tales they might teach the kids.How about an Aztek creation story? Coatlique, the Lady of theSkirt of Snakes, is first impregnated by an obsidian knife.(Ouch!) Then she gets pregnant again, which is shameful for agod and her children plot to kill her so she gives birth to a godof war who -- with the help of a fire serpent -- slaughters herchildren and the heavens shuddered and fell to destruction andCoatlique fertilized the earth after she fell and the world wasborn.Or jump to this page for a summary of a whole slew of creationmyths, such as the Iroquois belief that the world was formedon the back of a giant turtle. (Familiar to any fans of science-fiction humorist Terry Pratchett and his Discworld series.)Maybe you prefer the Greek myth that Prometheus -- one ofthe Titans -- created people just to show up his brother, whohad created animals.But whatever we do, we can't teach the dangerous, hatefulcreation story of Islam. That's a hateful, anti-Christian religionof godless heathens.And what does the Qur'an teach? It teaches that, um, Godcreated the entire universe and gave Man dominion over it andthat God created Adam and told him to live with his wife in avery nice garden and said, 'Do what you want, but don't eatfrom this tree or you'll become wrongdoers.' And Adam andEve ate from the tree and they were banished but God, who isthe Most Merciful, forgave Adam and Eve and said, Go, butdon't worry; I'll give you guidance and as long as you do whatI say you'll be fine and those who don't believe in Me and whatI say will be the inhabitants of fire and there they'll remain.Why are they trying to teach the Islamic faith in our schools?
