            <p>T H U R S D AY,  S E P T E M B E R  0 7 ,  2 0 0 6ABC's Lame Defense Over 9/11 MiniseriesControversyLet me just weigh in on one comment by ABC. They sent out astatement just a day or two ago that was reported in the New YorkTimes on Wednesday. It said, in part, “The events that lead to 9/11originally sparked great debate, so it’s not surprising that a moviesurrounding those events has revived the debate.”Nice try. In fact, there have been a NUMBER of TV documentaries, TVdocudramas, two feature films (Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center"and "United 93"), the 9-11 Commission Report itself, a number ofnonfiction books and even a graphic novel rendering of the 9-11Commission report and on and on and on. By and large, they have beenpraised for sticking to the facts. NONE OF THEM have even remotelybeen the center of controversy like this miniseries. All of them strove tobe as accurate as possible. NONE OF THEM have even been accused ofwholesale fabrications and lies, which the ABC miniseries has all butconfessed to. All of them strove to reflect -- where appropriate -- thebipartisan tone of the 9/11 Commission report. NONE OF THEMfocused on partisan political attacks or gave favored treatment to onepolitical party either in the making of their projects and certainly not inthe promoting of them. All of them -- including leftie Oliver Stone --strove for and achieved a non-partisan look at the events of the day.Heck, Spike Lee did a four hour documentary on the devastation ofKatrina and received nothing but praise and admiration for thebalanced, accurate but impassioned work he did. OLIVER STONE ANDSPIKE LEE -- it doesn't get more leftie than that, but they managed totackle 9-11 and Katrina without pandering to one party or lying anddistorting the facts. Why can't ABC? Because they didn't try.ABC's miniseries is not in hot water because 9-11 is a controversialtopic. We can name literally dozens of releases in all sorts of formatsthat tackled it successfully and with a respect for the facts. ABC'sminiseries is in hot water because it is an unbalanced, partisan attackthat attempts to rewrite history, it was promoted by reaching out onlyto the far right and it is a bald attempt to influence an upcomingelection by dividing the country and spreading lies and falsehoods.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
