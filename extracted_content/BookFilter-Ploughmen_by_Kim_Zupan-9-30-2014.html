Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis modern tale of the West has tense scenes of violence and murder but above all it's a character study of twomen. Young lawman Val is watching his marriage disintegrate over the dual pressures of his work and the bleakMontana landscape that is weighing his more successful wife down. John Gload is a prisoner in his jail who mayfinally pay for a lifetime of indifferent, soulless murder. Gload usually despises law enforcement but he takes a shineto Val and their late night heart-to-hearts become an uneasy dance as Val makes clear he'll report any confessionsGload might make and Gload tries to wrangle his way into getting Val to do one final act of mercy for this man whohas never shown any mercy in his life. Their dance is magnetic, with the reader wondering if Val will be draggeddown to Gload's level or perhaps Gload raised up to a moment of self-awareness and regret or perhaps both at thesame time. The crimes depicted in flashback or as they happen have a matter of fact brutality that is unnerving andreal but the main action takes place between these two men. In an otherwise strong debut, Zupan has a habit ofusing $5 words when a more commonplace one would suit just fine. It's a quirk one often sees in bad writing butrarely in good writing; yet seemingly on every other page I'd find myself having to look up a word. A good editor willtame this odd feature of prose that is otherwise strong and clear. A strong, compelling debut. -- MIchael GiltzLessWhat Others Say"Mr. Zupan produces pleasurably lush and baroque prose, especially when describing his setting’s awesome andunforgiving topography."—Wall Street Journal"Passionately arresting… Even though Zupan’s novel deals with grim topics, he plows the depths of grief andnumbness with such a concentrated dedication that the prose is a character in itself. His sentences are unleashed ina furious splendor… bleak and brilliant — the best kind of book."—Minneapolis Star Tribune"Stunning…A remarkable novel... It's almost hard to believe that it’s a debut…. It's a portrait of the West as asometimes desolate and cold place, full of possibility, maybe, but also full of danger from every corner. It's a modernWest, caught between the romance of the frontier and the mundane, harsh realities of living in the present day UnitedStates. And it’s absolutely beautiful, from its tragic opening scene to its tough, necessary end. Zupan is an unsparingwriter, but also a generous, deeply compassionate one."—NPR"Gripping… a strong debut for a talented wordsmith…. Zupan has that rare skill and we as readers are better off forit."…MoreWhat You Say</p>
