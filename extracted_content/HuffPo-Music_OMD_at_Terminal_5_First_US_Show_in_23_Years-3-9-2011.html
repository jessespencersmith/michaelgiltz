OMD
Terminal 5 in NYC
I think the bandmembers of Orchestral Manoeuvres in
the Dark  were almost as surprised as I was by the mob
of people who showed up for their first U.S. concert in23 years. Their new album History Of Modern  -- which
sounds very OMD-ish indeed and should delight fans --hasn't made much of a ripple commercially here.

<p>But there the audience was, faithful fans who weren't just there to hear "If You Leave," which was placed
seven songs in on the 21 song set list -- not so early that they wanted to get it out of the way, but early
enough to show they were confident in their songbook to keep the energy going.
That they did, with leaders Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys repeatedly saying how much they
appreciated the turnout and promising to come back again very, very soon. If anything, OMD proves that
credibility is elastic. They came into prominence riding a wave of UK synth-pop acts, with OMD leaningtowards the darker, Kraftwerk and Brian Eno side rather than the more Motown-ish feel of, say, HumanLeague. With songs name-checking the plane that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and Tesla, theybacked up their hooks with smarts. They were... cool.
Then along came John Hughes. He was applauded for having excellent taste and actually breaking new
acts with the soundtracks to his hit films about teenagers And yet, when Hughes helped give acts a hit
song, their coolness plummeted immediately: Simple Minds went from a critic's darling to a stolid popmachine with pretensions of U2, Psychedelic Furs seemed defanged and OMD was seen as just anotherpop act from the UK. A few Top 20 hits followed in the US, but everyone soon went their own ways.
A pop hit is a wonderful thing. I told one friend about the concert and he revealed that "If You Leave" wasthe song for he and his girlfriend in high school... until they got into a fight with another couple who wasfriends with them but insisted that the OMD tune was their  song. My friend Jamie, who cajoled me into
going to the show, said one of his first concerts was seeing OMD open for Thompson Twins at MadisonSquare Garden at the peak of fame for both of them. And another friend from Minnesota who saw mytweet about attending immediately texted the lyrics and wondered if James Spader was wanderingaround wearing a polo shirt with an up-turned collar. He too was amazed when I sent a photo showing
the several thousand people filling the venue.
And the best acts can survive a hit. McCluskey danced with all the dorky abandon of David Byrne at his
art-rockiest and then made fun of it. But he also knew how to strike a pose at the end of a tune and drawout more applause. After a patch of slow tunes, he said everyone needed to start moving. "It iscompulsory; you will be ejected if you don't dance." Like old pros, they took pleasure in starting off theset with a new song, "New Babies, New Toys." The title track received some of the warmest applause ofthe night and they introduced another new tune -- "Sister Mary Says" -- by saying, don't worry, it'sactually quite good.

<p>My favorite moment was the moody, quiet tune "New Holy Ground," with McClusky half in shadows and
the music sounding like it was rising up from the bottom of the ocean. But the entire set was more fun
than expected by this casual fan who had nothing more than the new album and a greatest hits set on his
shelf. In a way, OMD  is more fun live. Their sound on earlier albums might be a bit dry and poppy, but in
a show with a live drummer (in this case original bandmember Malcolm Holmes, not to mention Martin
Cooper on keyboards) and the warmth of imperfections to give their tunes a humanness, songs like"Souvenir," "Sailing On The Seven Seas" and "Joan Of Arc" (all Top 5 hits in the UK) sounded better thanever. It helps when a few thousand fans are cheering you along. Here's a link to their upcoming shows inthe US and Europe.

Great article. We are attending the Atlanta show this Monday night. Have enjoyed OMD since 1980.
Link below is a portion of our wedding video, dancing to the band as they kill "Souvenir" - our song.

I didn't even know about this show.
A few of my co-workers keep telling me to stay away from Terminal 5 because it's one of theWORST places in this city to see a show. So I didn't bother paying attention to the schedule.
OMD was one of my favorite bands out of that whole Synth-Pop era.Loved "GENETIC ENGINEERIN G", ENOLA GAY", and "ELECTRICI TY".
Gonna have to break out the compilatio n CD later.
Well, the older I get the more I appreciate seating :) 
It's just a huge space with balconies going up two levels. If you arrive early enough, youcan get close to the stage and avoid being trapped in the back. Or get upstairs and if youare early enough and can get on the rail, you'll have a great sight line the whole show. Aswith any show, the rowdier the crowd, the less fun you are likely to have in the middle ofthe floor. It just depends on the mood of the audience, just as it would anywhere else like
Bowery Ballroom. it's definitely big, though, so if the show is sold out, you don't want to
walk in five minutes before showtime and expect a happy time.
Second great OMD song, "Electrici ty"

Enola Gay. Enough said.
A good article. 
It is nice to see others noting that "pop" wonders can be deeper than the sum of their hits.O.M.D. and 88 Seconds in Greensboro is another example, (of many), of O.M.D.'s non-pop work.I would like to add that the Human League also had their "darker" moments too, (Seconds).
Enola Gay.
Wow.
O.M.D. at their best.LLNYRN    05:55 PM on 3/10/2011

so it's not that surprising . I imagine their fans enjoyed the show, I know when I saw Deep Purple on
their reunion tour years ago it was a very unique experience to see a group that I adored that hadn'tbeen around in decades.
23 years since they toured the US with the full lineup when they opened up for Depeche Mode on
the Music for the Masses tour which eventually became the 101 video and album. Andy toured in
92 in support of Sugartax and Paul toured in 2001 as "the guy who was not from OMD" due to
licensing issues. Both tours were fantastic, though paled in comparison to their A&M reunion tour acouple years ago when I saw them in London. Seeing them in DC tomorrow night so lookingforward to topping that show.
Enjoy the show!
Sign Siouxsie Now!
(OMD? Good harmonies, tight musiciansh ip . . . what's not to like?)
I was there last night, and I must say it was a fantastic show! They sounded great, and had just
incredible energy. Andy's moves were amazing/hi larious. Who knew OMD are such a good live act?
Well, seeing as they haven't played here in 23 years, probably not too many Americans. I, for one,hope they do come around again soon. I'd definitely catch them again.
Indeed!
