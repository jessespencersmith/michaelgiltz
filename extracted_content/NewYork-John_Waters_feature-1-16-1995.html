he sweetest kittens have the 
sharpest claws," read one of the ads 
for director Russ Meyer's low· budget 
Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (At Film Forum 
January 13-26.' John Waters, the director of 
Pink Flamingos and Hairspray, once wrote 
that the 1965 film was, "beyond a doubt, the 
best movie ever made ... possibly better than 
any film that will be made in the Mure." And 
time hasn't dulled Waters's enthusiasm. He's 
more than happy to take time out of his busy 
schedule to discuss its many virtues. "You 
can tell a Russ Meyer movie right away," he 
says. "The fast cutting, way before M1V; big 
breasts; nasty dialogue; and women in con· 
troll" Waters first saw the movie at a drive-in 
in his hometown of BaHimore and was hooked. "I went back every night and took different people," he says. 
"Divine and I saw it many, many times. H was certainly an influence--and Russ would probably be surprised 
to hear thi~n the Divine character." A drive-in seems like the perfect place to experience Pussycat in all 
its glory, but Waters disagrees. "No, I think it would be great to see in Buckingham Palace, really. I think it 
deserves more than the drive·in. To get its proper place in critical history, it has to be shown in New York." 
But what is its proper place? As a sexploitation classic? As camp? "It's as a great action mOllie, with the kind 
of movie stars we're hard·pressed to find anymore. Who are exploitation stars anymore? There aren't any, 
because Hollywood makes exploitation movies now and they aren't as much fun. The golden age of trash has 
been over for many years." So is classic dialogue. "One of my favorite lines," he says, "is when Tura Satana 
pulls into a gas station and the gas station attendant is looking down her blouse, and she says, 'You won't find 
it down there, Columbus!' " So it's not to be dismissed as a glorious bit of soft-core naughtiness? "Well, Russ 
did not want to ever do hard-core. He came as close as you could get to it and never did, which I think was 
wise. AHhough God knows he could make a good one." MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
