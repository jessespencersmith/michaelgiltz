On Streisand: An Opinionated Guide
BOOKFILTER’S SPRING PICKS FOR THEATER LOVERS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | APRIL 22, 2019
SHARE</p>
<p>By Ethan Mordden
$21.95, Oxford University Press
Barbra Streisand has never won a Tony! She’s been nominated twice and been honored with a
special Tony, but she’s never snagged a competitive statue. Streisand was among thenominees twice: once for her breakthrough work in I Can Get It for You Wholesale,  and a
second time, of course, for Funny Girl. While Streisand’s lifelong love of musical theater andlandmark recordings make her a Broadway baby, we can only hope those competitive juices willconvince her to return to Broadway someday. (Why not? It worked for Bette Midler!) And criticand historian Ethan Mordden agrees she’s one of the greats. His impassioned book looks atStreisand’s artistry and importance from every possible angle. He delves into the albums, themovies, the TV specials, and her early work in cabaret and theater. His book is subtitled AnOpinionated Guide,  and opinionated ain’t the half of it. You start reading but Mordden is already
galloping far, far ahead. He’s so informed and enthusiastic and defensive and wide-ranging inhis claims for Streisand’s talent, artistry, legacy, impact, and all-around greatness that it’s apleasure just trying to keep up.
Trust Exercise</p>
<p>By Susan Choi
$27, Henry Holt and Co.
The young people who watch the Tonys and listen to cast recordings and obsess over their
favorite shows? If they’re lucky, they have the talent to attend a performing arts school anddevote every waking moment to what they love. That’s the setting of Pulitzer Prize nomineeSusan Choi’s latest novel. Students Sarah and David fall under the spell of each other and theirmagnetic acting teacher, Mr. Kingsley. It’s the Reagan era, and Sarah is the Molly Ringwaldcharacter, a poor-ish student with a white-knight boyfriend in David, who is almostembarrassingly wealthy. That difference hardly matters when Mr. Kingsley turns the lights off inthe classroom and students crawl over and around each other with uncontained sensual glee.Sarah and David outpace the rest, not by having sex (no great marker in this world) but by theintensity of their unstable attraction/repulsion. Choi toys with our trust but it pays off in dividends.Certainly, fans of theater and serious fiction will relish how frustrating and rewarding and life-changing a drama class can be for adolescents, even if the closest they ultimately get to thebright lights of Broadway is a seat in the audience.

What Blest Genius?: The Jubilee That Made Shakespeare</p>
<p>By Andrew McConnell Stott
$26.95, W.W. Norton and Company
Even the greats need a boost to maintain the fame they deserve. It’s a little late to honor William
Shakespeare with an honorary Tony. But back in 1769, the next best thing happened: Stratford-Upon-Avon held a festival to honor its most famous son and cement his legacy in the process.Author Andrew McConnell Stott tackles this near-disaster of an event in great detail, from theprice-gouging inns to the wary locals and the intelligentsia who came to sniff at such a fuss. Heoffers pocket portraits of all involved, namely actor David Garrick, whose career revolved aroundpromoting Shakespeare, and James Boswell, who knew a good party when he saw one andcaptured everything in precise detail. Endless rain, endless tributary poems, and endlesscrowds converged to praise and elevate the Bard. Genius, on the part of Shakespeare, andperhaps luck on the part of the organizers.
The Inheritance</p>
<p>By Matthew Lopez
$19.95, Faber & Faber
The Tonys cap the theater season, coming on the heels of the U.K.’s Oliviers. At that theater-
awards event, the big winner was the epic play The Inheritance.  If you thought one massive six-
hour show about AIDS in New York City was enough, well, think again. Matthew Lopez’suniversally acclaimed drama used E.M. Forster’s novel Howards End  for inspiration, cast the
great Vanessa Redgrave in a key role (who needs an angel when you’ve got her?), and swepteveryone in its path with the play’s sheer ambition, heart, passion, and heat. If you can’t wait forit to come to Broadway (and how could you?), you can start to connect with it right now byreading Lopez’s play and using your imagination to cast, mount, and stage it.

Ideal readingbefore a child’s first trip to the museum or the ballet — and just as ideal when they want to reliveit.
The Assassin of Verona</p>
<p>By Benet Brandreth
$25.95, Pegasus Books

Shakespeare, our playwright in the making also has the makings of a spy.

the term drag may change in import and meaning over the years, men dressing as women and
women dressing as men and people dressing as their own true selves (or discovering themalong the way) are as old as drama. Certainly Shakespeare knew a thing or two about the fun ofcross-dressing.

Genre-hoppers like TheAdventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert  and Victor/Victoria  (films turned stage musicals) are
covered alongside Milton Berle, right up to RuPaul. Great images feature the likes of everyonefrom Lypsinka to Harvey Fierstein, from Hedda Lettuce to Charles Busch, as Decaro celebratesmore than 100 years of drag.
