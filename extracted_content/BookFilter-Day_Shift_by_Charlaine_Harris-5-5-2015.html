Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayHas a new sort of work of art sprung up before our eyes? Many classic works of fiction were serialized in magazines,Charles Dickens being the best example. And naturally some epic works need to be told over multiple volumes buttell essentially one long story: think Proust's masterpiece "In Search Of Lost Time," or Tolkien's "The Lord Of TheRings." And fiction has always featured on-going series, especially in mystery and sci-fi. But now I think TV is provinga bigger influence on fiction and what writers set out to do in one of their worlds. Used to be, a mystery might launcha detective with a satisfying, self-contained puzzler. If it worked, the hero would return and the world would deepenwith each new mystery. But Charlaine Harris and others are doing something slightly different. Her new series is setin "Midnight, Texas," an isolated town with denizens who all are hiding secrets, like the vampire, the hotline psychicwho really is a psychic and the witch that has more potential than she realizes. Some fans complained the first bookwas a  little slow. But now having read "Day Shift," the second book in the series, I realize that first book wasn't anovel: it was a pilot, just like on TV. It introduced the characters, told a story and set up some puzzles we realizedwouldn't be explained until later in the season...I mean series! Book Two is more contained, but it too feels like thelatest episode of a TV series. I don't mean Harris is looking at the success of "True Blood," which to me never quitecaptured the loopy humor of her Sookie Stackhouse tales. I simply mean that she realizes fans are with her for thelong haul. They don't need one long tale and they don't need neat, self-contained tales that provide a modest bit ofbackground or insight into our hero. They're willing to take the long view while Harris does something that's not quitea series of adventures and not quite one long story and not quite self-contained mysteries. If the Latin market didn'talready give this a particular soap opera spin and that idea of one complete story told over many episodes,  youmight call it a telenovela. Fans of the first book will be satisfied as we enjoy seeing the townsfolk of Midnightreluctantly come together to fight a common foe and keep their much-needed privacy from the world. It's low-key,character-driven and quieter than Harris' most famous work. But I'm intrigued and hope it gets renewed for at leastfour or five seasons. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for Midnight Crossroad“Excellent…No matter how unlikely or fantastic an element she might introduce into her pages, it’s always down-home and believable. She’s the Mark Twain of things that live under your bed.”—Houston Press“An excellent follow-up to True Detective…If you aren’t quite ready to let go of the eerie South yet, pick up your copyof Midnight Crossroad.”—The Novelettes“A little magic, a little mystery, and a lot of imagination make for a story that is both fun and edgy.”—Kirkus ReviewsWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
