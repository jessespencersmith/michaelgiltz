            <p>~VIS Presley left the 
building almost 30 
years ago, but his 
music and concert per­
formances remain -and 
two new DVD sets focus­

pearances may prove he's 
more popular than ever. 
, ) "~lvis '68 Comeback 
Special- Deluxe Edi­
tion" is a threecdisc set 
($49.98; BMG) featuring 
the entire ferocious, 
'leather-jacketed NBC 
special that spectacularly 
put Elvis back on top 
after years of fending off 
the British invasion, serv­
ing in the Army and 
churning out awful albums 
(and even worse movies). 
It includes seven hours 
of material, including the 
original special, and com-
o plete uncut footage from 
the entire four concerts 
that Elvis performed to 
'cdrm the core of what -
many consider the most 
important TV event of his 
career. 
, l"Elvis -Aloha From 
Hawaii Deluxe Edition" 
($29;98; BMG) is a two" 
pis~ set documenting 
Presley's groundbreaking­
i(~grandiose concert that was broadcast by satellite all around the world and 
$den:l?Ymore than 1.5 bil­
H6il people. 
f [ -The DVD set includes 
the entire concert, the en­
tire rehearsal concert from 
the night before and un­
edltediootage of Elvis 
moving through the crowd 
~~~~hting blessings and fmill people lIke a 
new messiah. 
BMG's Ernst Jorgensen 
served as a consultant on 
the projects -no sur-
"On the '68 special, 
you can see Elvis is 
trying everything he 
can to please us. 
Therets an urgency 
and almost despair 
in it." 
prise, since he's one of the 
key people responsible for 
the elaborate boxed sets 
that have reclaimed Elvis's 
musical importance and 
the author of fanatically 
detailed accounts of Pres­
ley's recording sessions 
and day-by-day doings. 
Jorgensen has been wait­
ing years for this treasure 
trove, but he's used to 
waiting -he had to wait 
until 1969 to see the spe­
cial in the first place. 
"In the small country of 
Denmark, it arrived 12 
months after you'd seen 
it," says Jorgensen. "So I'd 
had the album for a year 
before I actually saw the 
show. and I freaked out completely." Despite all 
the advance hoopla, the 
" '68 Comeback Special" 
more than lived up to the 
hype. 
"It was nothing like I 
could have ever imagined 
because we'd never seen 
him in concert," Jorgensen 
says. "We only knew him 
from the movies. 
On the NBC special, you 
-can see Elvis is trying ev­
erything he can to please 
us. There's an urgency and 
almost despair in it. And 
when you see 'Aloha From 
Hawaii,' here's somebody 
sitting on top of the 
world in total con-
trol. It's two very 
different emo­
tional experi--
ences. Elvis 
needed us in 
'68." 
These two 
DVD sets are 
Holy Grails 
for Presley 
fans, but 
don't think that 
means Elvis re­
leases are 
coming to an 
end. 
In the 
works by 
the Presley 
estate is 
an elabo­
rate multi­
part docu­
mentary - a la "The Be::l,tles An-, 
thology" -that plans to 
cover his entire career and 
to include never-before­
seen footage that Jorgen­
sen has been compiling 
from collectors and fanat­
ics all over the world. 
But don't hold 
your breath: it 
won't be out 
any sooner 
than 2007. 
Two new 
DVDs feature 
Elvis Presley's 
TV specials 
from his later 
years-both 
part of his 
comeback.</p>
