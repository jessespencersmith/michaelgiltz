            <p>ollywood loves a romance, but lett
face it: A nasty breakup is a close
second. For every movie about endless
love, there's another one about the
endless squabbles and lights that
lead to divorce, like in "Tyler perry's The Family
That Preys" and "The Women," both opening
Friday.
Unless, of course, the couple is really in
love anyway, in which case the divorce is just
a prelude to getting back together again. Here
are some of Hollywood's bitterest marriage
meltdowns.
THE WAR OF THE ROSES (1989)
IncconcilaHe differences: lt's simply
not possible that Oliver and Barbara Rose
(Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) could
have had half as much fun being in love as
they have tearing each other down in this black
comedy.
Tte settffi: A scorched-earth policy
guarantees there's not so much as a cocktail
napkin left to split between the two after
they're done scrapping over their home.
A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966)
lreconcilabh differences: Wow. When you
defy the Church and God and even execute the
noble Sir Thomas More (paul Scofield) - the
way Henry Vlll (Robert Shaw) does - you must
real/y want a divorce.
Tte set[ement: The king kept his head andgot his new marriage - and the Church
of England to boot More got immortality
through an Oscar-winning movie and a great
play (headed to Broadway this fall with Frank
Langella).
I NTOLERABLE CRUELTY (2OO3)
ln€concihbh differences: you can imagine
Tracy and Hepburn giving a less wacky spin
to this delicious Coen brothers comedy about
sterling divorce lawyer George Clooney and
the serial divorcde (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whoyeams to defeat him.
Thesefiement Love, your honor! They maytangle in court, but it's only between the sheets
where these worthy adversaries will lind true
satisfaction.
THE SOUID & THE WHALE (2OO5)
ln€@ncilable difhrcnoe": Mainly, Jeff
Daniels seems annoyed that wife Laura
Linney is getting published in The New yorker
while his novels are received indifferently;
he takes revenge by "mentoring" younger
women.
Ifte setdement Their two children - caught
in the passive-aggressive cross fire of this
Iiterary couple - are the real losers as the
divorce messes with their minds and leaves
them emotionally bereft.
THE FTRST WTVES CLUB (1996)
lreoncflabh diffuences Debra Messing
would call it being a "starter wife," but Bette
Midlec Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton were
there first when it came to the humiliation ofbeing traded in for a newer model.
The setdement Laughter - and looking
fabulous - is the best revenge for these
women, who find that bonding with each
other is more important than getting back at
their exes ... though revenge can be awfully fun,
too.
IttFP EElrrIBAPqgqplreconcilattle difhrences: you knew
divorce was a fact of life when even Disney felt
comfortable making a romantic comedy about
Hayley Mills playing twins who want to bring
their divorced parents back together.
fhe setflenent Luckily for dad Brian
Keith, both Haleys succeed - he reunites with
redheaded mom Maureen O'Hara. and everyonepretends the divorce never happened.
