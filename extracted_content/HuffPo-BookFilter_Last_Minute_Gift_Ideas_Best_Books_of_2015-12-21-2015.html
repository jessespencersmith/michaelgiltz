THE GOLDEN AGE  By Jane Smiley
$26.95; Knopf
Elena Ferrante has been getting all the attention for her acclaimed
Neapolitan quartet,  which just finished. If you've got a hip friend who has
been raving about them, turn them onto Jane Smiley's brilliant American
Century trilogy. The first two books are out in paperback and the finale
The Golden Age  just hit hardcover. It tracks one hundred years of US
history, from the Great Depression to the near future. Each chapter jumpsahead a year so there are one hundred in all. Starting on a small family
farm in the heartland, you watch a family spin off children andgrandchildren and nieces and nephews and husbands and wives andlovers and on and on. It's pure narrative pleasure, along with Smiley's
ambitious capturing of a turbulent century almost as an aside. She's
especially remarkable at presenting the perspective of small children and
even toddlers, not to mention the passage of time, current events</p>
<p>becoming family history and then legend, showing empathy for a wide
range of characters from every walk of life and so much more. Smiley
won the Pulitzer Prize for A Thousand Acres.  This trilogy might be her
masterpiece.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF CREATION  By Bill Mesler and H. James Cleaves
$27.95; W.W. Norton
Got a science buff on your list? Or an agnostic or atheist or person of
faith who is enlivened rather than threatened by knowledge? Then this isthe book for them! How did life begin? It's arguably the greatest scientific
question of all and certainly the one that goes to the heart of existence.
This very readable and engaging history charts how that question hasbeen tackled over the centuries, from inchoate early stabs in the dark tothe latest experiments and theories drawing upon new technology and
evidence collected in space. Mesler and Cleaves fill their story with petty
rivalries, stubborn refusal to acknowledge facts, u-turns in theory, deadends, eureka moments and more. Indeed, from microscopes to Hadroncolliders, our understanding of the origins of life have gone hand in hand
with technological breakthroughs. But some things remain: again and
again, pioneers who watch their ideas become superseded can't bear toadmit they've been lapped and cling to tired ideas. Others of course
remain stubborn despite being laughed at but are redeemed when their
theories gain primacy...only to see those built upon or passed by as well.From DNA to spontaneous generation (an idea we were taught to deride
as schoolchildren but which has returned in more sophisticated form) this
is popular history of the first order.</p>
<p>PRETTY GIRLS  By Karin Slaughter
$27.99; William Morrow
Mystery buff? Someone who told you they loved Girl On A Train?  Give
them this and they'll have something new to rave over. Karin Slaughter is
a big name in mystery, a "brand name" author whose fans have bought
her novels in the tens of millions around the world. Well, she's about toget bigger. Her new stand-alone thriller Pretty Girls  is a roller coaster of a
tale, filled with twists and turns, each one more jaw-dropping, unnerving
and just plain fun than the one before. But it also retains Slaughter's gift
for genuine, complex characters and that makes the danger palpable, thestakes real, the emotions raw. The story begins long after a tragedy.Claire and Lydia are the sisters who "survived" when their sibling Julia
was abducted off a college campus two decades earlier. Of course their
family was never the same. Their father became obsessed with the case
and died alone; their mother won't discuss it; and the two sisters are
estranged. Claire has the successful marriage, the country clubmembership and the showcase home. Lydia is a recovering addict (andsex worker) dating an ex-con. But nothing is as it seems: a violent murder
upends Claire's world and pulls Lydia back into her orbit. Slowly we
realize Lydia is on the road to recovery, Claire is on a slide into turmoiland they're both being haunted and hunted by a spectre from the past.Without ever shortchanging the adrenaline rush of a thriller, Slaughter has
crafted characters far more compelling than the usual cardboard cut-outs
which pass for people in most such genre fare. It's a triumph that willbring this author to a wider audience than ever. And that's saying
something.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF ACQUIESCENCE  By Steven Fraser
$28; Little Brown & Co.</p>
<p>SAVING CAPITALISM  By Robert B. Reich
$26.95; Knopf
BRYANT & MAY AND THE BURNING MAN  By Christopher Fowler
$26; Bantam
A trio of books perfect for the anarchist, Bernie Sanders supporter,
mystery buff (and British history buff), armchair economist, fan of the newmovie The Big Short  and more! Why didn't the populace rise up? That
was one question after the Occupy movement dispersed and no financialfigures of any note went to prison for well-documented crimes that haveled to record fines (often softened by record government bailouts of WallStreet as well.) The fascinating history told again in The Age Of
Acquiescence  shows how in fact America has a long history of the people
rising up and demanding change, of taking to the streets and paying for it
in blood when their calls for a 60 hour (!) workweek and one day off on
Sunday were decried as socialism or communism and worse. The last
time inequality reached such levels, the nation was roiled by "riots" orprotests, depending on your point of view. Those movements have been
a regular occurrence throughout US history and are the norm, rather than
the exception...until now. Fraser tells an informative, fascinating tale ofprotest and change that is compelling reading whatever one's politics.
Reich, on the other hand, will fall on deaf ears unless you're already won
over to the idea that sometimes capitalism is its own worst enemy. Hemakes calm, clear-eyed mush of various paper tigers, like the idea thatany new rules and regulations would interfere with unfettered capitalism
(there's no such thing). He has a host of reasonable ideas and some
doozies at the end that will take your breath away even if you do keep aGuy Fawkes mask at the ready. But it's capitalism explained for the
general public and arms readers with intelligent take-downs of the Big
Business argument that any rule is a bad rule.
Finally, Bryant & May are a pair of aging British detectives in the Peculiar
Crimes Unit. The Burning Man  is their 12th adventure and while the book
proudly declares Bryant & May will be back, it certainly feels like a swan
song. What's it doing with these other two books? Well, the duo most
solve a string of bizarre murders taking place against a backdrop of riots
that bring London to a standstill. Yet another financier has been foundguilty of reckless crimes and seems to be getting off scot free. Thisrevelation occurs during the week from Halloween (aka Mischief Night)
and Guy Fawkes Day, when the quashing of an insurrection against the
government is celebrated. However, Guy Fawkes has been turned fromlead into gold: instead of celebrating the primacy of the government, it's
become a celebration of defiance and free-thinkers. As the murders pile</p>
<p>up, ever-growing demonstrations spread from the financial district to the
entire city of London and the tone becomes nigh on apocalyptic. (It helps
that the voluble, ever erudite Bryant sympathizes with the hoi polloi and
holds forth at lengthy on inequality and the like.) Beyond the grippingbackdrop, what makes this entry so special for fans of the series is thepersonal travails that bedevil our heroes, a very touching subplot
surrounding the inevitable decline in mental faculties that will come to
most everyone. It's been tried by authors portraying Sherlock Holmes inold age, but this one trumps them in poignancy. Buy a mystery buff thefirst book in the series or any lover of politics the latest and they'll soon
start at the beginning and thank you for it.
THE DAY THE CRAYONS CAME HOME  By Drew Daywalt and Oliver
Jeffers
$18.99; Philomel
Picture books are filled with sequels and series. And just like most current
Hollywood movies, they're rarely worth the bother. But here Daywalt and
Jeffers follow their blockbuster hit The Day The Crayons Quit!  with this
perfectly adorable sequel. In the first book, the crayons in a crayon box
went on strike, writing letters to the little boy who keeps them, explaining
their varied reasons for needing a break. It was so witty, clever and just
plain fun any adult who read it kicked themselves for not having thoughtof the idea on their own. But don't be fooled: a "great" idea for a picturebook is actually pretty darn easy. Actually creating a picture book with the
perfect text and the ideal illustrations to bring them to life is pretty darn
hard. They did it once and now Daywalt and Jeffers have done it again:this time, the crayons have written letters from their "vacation," whether
it's a vacation hidden in the cushions of the couch or a vacation left by
the pool outside or a vacation in the clutches of the family baby that
scrawls and bites a crayon that would really, really like to come home.</p>
<p>Each letter is amusing and they build on each other wonderfully. A
delight.
CARRYING ALBERT HOME  By Homer Hickam
$25.99; William Morrow
DEAR MR. YOU  By Mary-Louise Parker
$25; Scribner
Two very clever novels/memoirs that find just the right, unique way of
telling their stories.
If I had a bookstore, I'm not sure where I'd stock this new book by Homer
Hickam, the author of a string of memoirs and novels, namely "Rocket
Boys" aka "October Sky" about his childhood in coal mining country. It'scalled "Carrying Albert Home" and since it's a sort-of true memoir about
a road trip his parents took with their pet alligator down to Orlando,</p>
<p>Florida during the Great Depression, at first glance the Biography section
makes sense. Then you keep reading and the stories get wilder and more
improbable -- bootleggers, smugglers, bank robbers, union radicals, a
Hollywood movie, a hurricane and both John Steinbeck AND ErnestHemingway -- make appearances. Well, maybe fiction makes moresense. By the end, after the ghosts and the wild mountain man spouting
poetry with his salacious Muslim wife and that dancing fool, actor Buddy
Ebsen, I'd be looking for the Tall Tales section. In the end, I'll just stock itup front by the door, so everyone can see the great cover, recognize thename Hickam, glance at a summary, and maybe open a page or two and
find themselves sucked in and bingo, you've got another sale. Sweet,
funny, and somehow clear-eyed but romantic at the end. And sort-oftrue.
What a clever fox Mary-Louise Parker proves to be. She gets the best of
both worlds by a single stroke of genius: this memoir-ish novel (or
novelistic memoir) is structured as a series of letters from Parker to the
men in her life. They range from a poetic salvo that opens the book
addressing them one and all to a moving finale to the man she imaginesgathering the oysters that made up one of the last good meals for herdying father. Parker delivers a short story with a letter addressed to the
dogs in her life -- not the animals but the boyfriends who behaved like
dogs, here transformed into actual dogs in a head-spinning allegory thatis funny and caustic and utterly unanswerable. (What guy can complain
about it, since if they see themselves in it they are damning their own
doggy ways?) Truth and better-than-truth (i.e. fiction) mergeherebeautifully. Parker nails details of acting school with deadpan hilarity,
skewers herself happily, celebrates her children and so much more. You
won't find any dissection of her many theatrical triumphs or dishing ofbackstage dirt. Rather marvelously, "Dear Mr. You" is both disarminglyintimate (I feel like I know her) and a bravura performance that keeps us
politely at arm's length with its talent. And isn't that what great acting
(and great writing) are often about? This is her first book but surely nother last.</p>
<p>AURORA  By Kim Stanley Robinson
$26; Orbit
UPROOTED  By Naomi Novik
$25; Del Rey
Two of the best sci-fi and fantasy books of the year, ideal for fans of
either or anyone who doesn't realize yet that they will be fans soon.
A brilliant stand-alone novel from one of our best writers. Kim Stanley
Robinson's first bold gambit in this tale about colonizing the stars is tomake the narrator an A.I. Early in the novel, we are on a ship that hasbeen traveling for generations towards new worlds where humanity hopes
to carve out new homes. In his Mars  trilogy, Robinson built drama out of
the practical and human challenges of terraforming Mars. Here he
ponders the huge obstacles to simply making it intact to a planet light
years away. When a key character orders her ship's artificial intelligence</p>
<p>to start telling the story of their journey, it's a master stroke. This solves a
constant problem in science fiction: since the narrator is an A.I., its
exposition of technical info can be explained away easily by a computer's
preference for facts over story. We get the hard data and slowly,beautifully, we see the A.I. learn and become a better narrator andeventually -- perhaps -- gain self-awareness. For a while this seems the
book's major accomplishment. But then Robinson pushes further and plot
twists make this story even more riveting. Fundamentally, it's about ourinnate need to survive and explore. It's like the end of the film "Gravity"but without the faux overheated drama; here the moment is earned.
"Aurora" becomes deeply moving, as well as entertaining and compelling
and provoking. In short, everything one expects from Kim StanleyRobinson.
Like most fantasy fans, I'm eagerly awaiting the ninth and final volume in
Naomi Novik's wonderful "Temeraire" series that cleverly and smartly
imagines what would happen if there were dragons in the Napoleonic Era.
But the muse can't be denied. For whatever reason, Novik felt compelled
to write this stand-alone tale and it's a wholly satisfying gem. Based infairy tale, it begins in classic fashion with a corker of an opening line: "OurDragon doesn't eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell
outside our valley." Novik has you immediately and never falters. The
novel begins with a ritual: the once-a-decade ceremony when the localwizard (nicknamed the "Dragon") chooses a young maid to take away to
his tower, where she serves him in ways the locals can't imagine but
spend an awful lot of time trying. From the fate of our heroine Agnieszkato the fate of her valley to the fate of the kingdom and indeed the world,
the scope of this story slowly but inexorably expands. So does the magic,
whether the highly detailed, scientific magic of the Dragon or the morecreative, "instinctive" magic that Agnieszka soon proves adept at. Thechapters fly by; in reading it, I kept thinking, "Ok, just one more, just one
more" over the two days I gobbled it down. And the medieval world Novik
creates is as rooted in reality as her Napoleonic one. But unlike mostfantasy, what I remember best is not the world but the vivid and complexcharacters. In what is ultimately a rather remarkable novel, I realized there
were no genuine villains. Oh there was danger and evil aplenty (as
symbolized by the malignant Wood that encroaches on Agnieszka'svalley); armies clash, people struggle for power and so on. But time and
again Novik reveals characters driven not by a black heart but by sincere
if sometimes misguided impulses: indeed, nothing is scarier thansomeone doing great evil for what they consider a higher purpose. Thereal triumph is at the end where Novik displays the ability to make
understanding your enemy just as thrilling as destroying them. I love what
Novik has done in the Temeraire series but this is the best single novel
she's written. So far.</p>
<p>THIS DIVIDED ISLAND  By Samanth Subramanian
$27.99; Thomas Dunne Books
ONE NATION, UNDER GODS  By Peter Manseau
$28; Little Brown and Company
Religion -- or the excuse of religion --is at the heart of these two
nonfiction books, one a tragic history of Sri Lanka and the other anabsorbing history of faith in the United States.
Journalist Samanth Subramanian tackles the longest war of the 20th
century. (Perhaps -- sadly it's up for debate depending on how onecategorizes various conflicts). But there's no debate that Sri Lanka's
deadly internecine turmoil of 30+ years was especially virulent. It dragged
on for decades and ended with the slaughter of men, women andchildren (mostly Tamil) that has been decried as a war crime.</p>
<p>Submramanian doesn't dive into an historical background or seem to
address the broad sweep of the action. Instead, in what amounts to a
travelogue of sorts, he goes to Sri Lanka and talks to anyone who will
speak with him -- Tamil and Sinhalese, Buddhist and Hindu and Muslim,the bereft and the triumphant, the clear-eyed and the self-deluded. It's a
remarkable, empathetic work of reporting. As an outsider, it's easy for me
to say a pox on both houses: the Tamils had legitimate complaints buttheir rebellion/violence soon devolved into monstrous acts, while theSinhalese have proven pitiless in victory. But the great gift here is not in
just giving all sides a (morally complicated) voice. It's in bringing to life the
tangled misery of so many people, from government officials to wives ofrebels who still defend the indefensible like child soldiers to orphans andthose who may  be widowed or orphaned but just don't know. I won't
soon forget a haunting passage where the author and others entered onebattered area. A woman offhandedly asked him to write down the nameand particulars of a missing relative. A villager overheard this and asked
them to do the same and soon they were surrounded by desperate
people yearning to give the particulars of their missingfather/son/mother/daughter/brother/sister/neighbor. Never mind that theauthor isn't really in a position to help. They just want to be heard. Other
vivid moments endure: a stolid mechanic who takes days of patient
waiting before opening up, a pair of artificial legs waiting mournfullyagainst a wall for the return of their presumably dead owner and on andon. Looming over it all is the inescapable sense that Sri Lanka's woes are
far from over.
Call it "The People's Religious History Of The United States" and you'll
capture the vividness and potential impact of "One Nation, Under Gods"
by author Peter Manseau. He vividly captures the religious diversity thathas defined the United States long before it even was  the United States.
This book journeys in time from a Muslim slave brought to the continent
by the Spanish who ended up a god of sorts (trust me, it's not a happy
ending for him) all the way to Barack Obama's inaugural address in whichthe President formally acknowledged the many faiths that make up our
country. In between Manseau has you rethink everything from the Salem
witch trials (not so crazy, actually ) to the Great Awakening to that hippiehappening where they hoped to levitate the Pentagon. Manseau showsslave owners who initially were vehemently opposed to converting their
"property" into Christians become slave owners eager to do so. (The
reason for both stances? Money.) From the role of women in seeding newideas to the role of Jews in the American revolution to the role of
Buddhists in WW II (their refusal to assimilate in terms of language and
faith made them hugely helpful to the Allied cause), Manseau's bookrepeatedly casts our common history into a new light. His synthesis of
well-established facts with original reporting make this Book One for</p>
<p>anyone who wants to be enlightened on the true story of religion in
America.
KILLING AND DYING  By Adrian Tomine
$22.95; Drawn & Quarterly
Adrian Tomine's new collection of short stories is just 121 pages long.
But it took me two weeks to read it and longer to think about it and beready to write something. And of course, he writes comics (or graphic
novels, or comix or whatever term is preferred this day) so I could have
read it all in an hour. But that wouldn't have done justice to a series oftales that are so sad and lovely and human. First, the entire bookpublished by Drawn & Quarterly is just a pleasure to hold in your hand. It's
beautifully designed, from the translucent cover to the haunting image
imprinted on the front itself, a picture of a suburban street with itsDenny's restaurant and strip malls and cars seemingly frozen in place. Ithas no people and a Hopper-like aura of loneliness that captures well the
tone of the stories within. Each story plays with form in subtle ways. While
every story feels of a piece, capturing people struggling to connect orgive their life some purpose or explain their inchoate desires and fears;
they also are jazz-like in their low-key visual differences. "A Brief History
Of The Art Form Known As 'Hortisculpture'" is an homage to comic stripsdown to the color Sunday edition and has a tale of frustrated creativity
anyone in a relationship with a closeted musician/painter/writer/sculpture
will identify with. "Translated, from the Japanese" leaves the absence ofthe characters being talked about while they fly from one city to anotherwonderfully resonant. "Intruders" and its sketch-like visuals add a noir-ish
vibe to the story of a returning soldier trying to find something to moor
him to the country he's returned to but can't connect with. The writing istaut and telling but of course it's the combination of writing and visuals
that make these short stories and graphic novels in general so unique and</p>
<p>powerful. "Go Owls" shows the shock of physical abuse in a relationship
in just a few brief panels. The title story "Killing And Dying" surprises us
regularly with the journey of a stuttering, insecure daughter looking tostand-up for some confidence while her father undermines andawkwardly supports her at the same time. Yet it's the dad standing by
while watching his wife through a window comfort their crying daughter
that moved me more than any accusations, failed punchlines or hecklesfrom hostile audiences. It's natural to compare Tomine to other graphicnovelists but I kept thinking of William Trevor, an Irish specialist in short
stories so heart-wrenchingly sad it could take me months to read any
new collection he put out. One of the year's best books. Period.
MISTER MAX: THE BOOK OF KINGS  By Cynthia Voigt
$19.99; Knopf Books For Younger Readers
Perfect for middle grade readers, fans of theatrics, mysteries or anyone
who loves a good tale.
Apparently, I need to catch up on my Cynthia Voigt. This excellent
conclusion to her Mister Max trilogy has left me a little gobsmacked, if I'mhonest. Did she plan the ramping up of the complexity and emotional
depth the way it played out? I read all three books within a few weeks so
perhaps that helped me appreciate the arc even more. Anyway, I supposeyou could read the third book alone, but why would you? It's a trilogy andmeant to be read that way. In Book One, Max lives in a quaint sort of turn
of the century kingdom with his parents who run a theatrical troupe. Max
loves them and the theater but it's not quite his thing. Exactly what histhing will be, this 12 year old boy isn't sure about. His parents are lured toa far-away country to establish a new national theater company and Max
is accidentally left behind with his librarian grandmother. They realize the
parents have been kidnapped and worry and worry and worry. To</p>
<p>maintain his independence, Max becomes sort of a detective, though he
insists on calling himself The Solutioneer. (Why the books aren't called
The Solutioneer remains a mystery to me.) There's also a girl that annoysMax with all her questions and a boarder in Max's home who has a
mysterious past and other dangling threads. So there's the set up. At first,
Max solves rather mundane or obvious problems like finding a lost dog. InBook Two, however, Voigt takes a quantum leap forward: Max is nowsolving problems of the human heart and showing a great deal of insight.
In Book Three, Max and his friends head off to rescue the boy's parents.
The final volume is especially good, with complex passages depicting thatawkward moment when a child sees their parents as people, flaws andall, rather than "parents," not to mention some completely earned but still
bravura changes that make clear the pattern Voigt was creating from the
very start. Read Book One alone and -- like me -- you might consider it apleasant diversion, with so-so mysteries but appealing characters. Book
Two is much better and Book Three deepens the entire work. It's like a
magic trick the way she suddenly reveals the life Max was intended for allalong.</p>
<p>1944  By Jay Winik
$35; Simon & Schuster
THE BOOK OF ARON By Jim Shepard
$23.95; Knopf
SYMPHONY FOR THE CITY OF THE DEAD  By M.T. Anderson
$25.99; Candlewick
World War II is apparently an endless source of fascinating stories; we
certainly won't run out of fresh approaches to that monumental event inour lifetime. Fans of history, great fiction and classical music will all be
delighted by the following.
The title of Jay Winik's new work of history is a feint. While the book
pivots on the year 1944, it's not really about that penultimate year of
World War II, not really. Winik has a more devastating focus than that.</p>
<p>Many books have been written about WW II. Many more about the
Holocaust. But few if any have told both stories in parallel to such
dramatic and awful effect. Because of course they're not two stories; they
are inextricably intertwined. So we have here Winik's assured overview ofworld war, deft portraits of FDR and Churchill and Stalin and Eisenhowerand Hitler, battle plans, political machinations, Pearl Harbor, D-Day, the
building of the atomic bomb, the imprisonment of Americans for the crime
of being Japanese (while Americans of Italian and German descentremained unmolested) -- all in compelling detail and with a clear sense of
how events seemed at the time. But again and again and again, Winik
keeps alive the Holocaust. He shows what was happening, the build up ofthe death camps, the trickle of information and witnessing that turned intoa flood and alongside that the moral failure of the free world. When tens
of thousands of Jewish children might be rescued, excuses pour out.
When tens of thousands of European children might be rescued, not amoment is lost. When prison camps can be bombed and war prisonersfreed, no daring is too great. When death camps are bombed, it is only by
accident because the bombs are meant for factories a few miles away.
The US is not alone (though Churchill is the first to awake to the moraldemands of this crime against humanity). Still, from 1942 on, we see a
feckless State Department, foot-dragging bureaucrats and the tin-eared
indifference of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who is given countlessopportunities to act and fails to grasp them. The book is too nuanced tosimply make a blistering case against FDR: his health was poor, the
demands of war seemingly all consuming, etc. But no one can read this
book and not agree with Winik that a great opportunity was lost. Lincolntransformed the Civil War into a war for freedom and against slavery. FDR
might have made WWII about more than just winning; he night have
transformed it into a war to defeat the Holocaust and similar crimesagainst humanity. Winik sees the decades since and their repeated timidfailings in the face of genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda and elsewhere
as the awful fruits of 1944, fruits that make the victory the West achieved
a little more hollow.
It's funny! Yes, "The Book Of Aron" is a story about a little boy who
becomes a scavenger in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. Yes, it'sbleak and awful as we see his world slowly close in, the walls go up, thefamily members die off or disappear. But in his saddest, sharpest novel
yet, author Jim Shepard captures the vein of black humor that runs
through the despair of the Jewish people. The bickering of a husband andwife, the kvetching of the neighbors, the bleak wisdom of kids -- it's all
here, all musical in the dialogue you can't help but speak out loud, all
captivating and alive even as they slowly starve to death. Aron is, Isuppose, a survivor, a boy who just tries to stay one step ahead of fate.
(Good luck with that.) Morality doesn't come into it, but he steals and</p>
<p>scavenges and helps feed his family and gets by. Aron is almost
deliriously unaware of any other way of existing; everyone is always
saying "Aron only looks out for himself" but Shepard shows this boy in allhis humanity, a kid wondering exactly what he was supposed to do whenpushed by everyone into talking with the local collaborators or when he
has a gun held to his head and is told to do this or that or the other. He
had a choice? Shepard's tale is bristling with tragic details -- Aron isalways crying, it seems -- but it's a joy to read. One of the WarsawGhetto's tragic figures -- the child advocate Janusz Korczak -- figures
prominently and beautifully, but like everyone else he is fully complex and
contradictory and alive. The tale builds and builds but this isn't a storyabout what happens to Aron. It's richer, more satisfying than that. You'llread it quickly and then want to read it again. Unforgettable.
No serious reader I know cares about genre: is it mystery, sci-fi, romance,
literary fiction, graphic novel, young adult, a chapter book, a biography, a
history, poetry, play? Who cares? Is it good? That's all that matters. The
foolishness of labels has never been more apparent than in theastonishing career of M.T. Anderson, who has produced a string ofsophisticated, witty works under the label of "young adult." That term has
covered his dystopian sci-fi, horror, contemporary teen, historical fiction
and now this work of biography. Since "young adult" also encompassesthe masterpiece "Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn," as complex andinvolving a work as there is, he should happily embrace it. Essentially,
"young adult" means there is (probably) a young adult at the heart of the
story. And yet, "young adult" indicates one initial audience for this workand that may explain why it's so particularly good. Anderson has wowed
with "Feed" and his landmark two volume work "The Astonishing Life Of
Octavio Nothing," fiction that captures the Revolutionary Era, shines afresh light on the horrors of slavery and presents our nation's founding
from a novel perspective. It's intensely detailed and utterly convincing. So
now we have a work of nonfiction about composer Dimitri Shostakovichand how he created his Seventh Symphony during the Siege ofLeningrad. It's a delight; no surprise since Anderson has evinced an
enthusiasm for music almost as joyful as Shostakovich's love of soccer.
What makes this book so good is that Anderson doesn't simplify the talefor its presumed audience. But he does clarify  the story in an elegant
manner that any historian or biographer should envy. With seeming ease,
Anderson tells of Shostakovich's life, the unceasing terror of Stalin's
reign, the invasion by Germany, the horrors of the siege, cannibalism,despair and the role of music and why it mattered so much. He also deftly
captures the moral complexity of Shostakovich's life, surrounded as he
was by friends and family who were murdered by the state or turnedagainst him to protect themselves or depended on him for their survival. A
children's book? Hardly. And definitely. This isn't dumbed down history.</p>
<p>Indeed, more traditional doorstops about history might now seem
clogged up, overstuffed as they are with unnecessary dates and detail
when Anderson -- with a vivid image and pointed sentence -- can makehis case with directness and verve. It leaves you with one excitingquestion: what will Anderson do next?
