What We Say
He had me at "IQ" -- a very cool nickname. Here is a deeply satisfying, funny and emotionally complex novel that's also the
launch of a promising new mystery series. Isaiah Quintabe aka IQ is a Los Angeles high school dropout who happens to beSherlock-smart. Like the great Easy Rawlins, IQ is a detective on the sly, helping local people who can't or won't go to the
police and who (sometimes) pay him any way they can. When a paranoid rap star decides his ex-wife is trying to kill him,
the Kanye-like nutter's agent hires IQ to calm the guy down and get his meal ticket back in the recording studio.Unfortunately for the agent, IQ quickly realizes the rap star isn't so crazy after all. From this set-up, debut author Joe Idetells his story on two tracks. In the present, IQ follows his one shaky lead through the world of dog-breeding, right up toShare This Book

<p>the door of a lunatic assassin. In flashback, we see how the once-promising student Isaiah is devastated after his brother is
killed in a car accident, devolving into a life of crime alongside a street-savvy gang member at his high school. So we getthe suspense of a case to solve while delving into the deeper, more meaningful mystery of how the righteous IQ once leanedinto the bad side...and what made him turn his life around. Ide handles all this very, very well and the book is filled with
great and real characters -- even when they're behaving in Carl Hiaasen lunacy, they're still believable. It's a pleasure to see
IQ solve puzzles with his intellect and as a bonus he's also a fine wheel man with a skill set in self defense. Except for anearly action scene that's movie-ready but out of character for IQ and the novel as a whole, Ide never misses a beat. Hedoesn't yet have the historical scope of Walter Mosley and it'll take the second entry to see if Ide can absorb us in a crimewithout the dramatically rich flashbacks to IQ as a troubled, depressed kid. But boy is this a fun, superior debut. -- Michael

What Others Say
"One of the most original thrillers of the year . . . [A] sometimes scary, often whimsical, off-the-wall delight . .
. It's a mad world that late-blooming Joe Ide has brought forth from his past, a spicy mix of urban horror,
youthful striving and show-business absurdity. His IQ is an original and welcome creation."â Patrick Anderson ,
Washington Post  - 
"Wonderfully quirky . . . Exhilarating language and [an] oddball cast . . . A total laff-riot"â Marilyn Stasio , New
York Times Book Review  - 
"A few things I love about this... [IQ is] rooted in his community in a way that his inspiration never was... IQ is a
small story in the way the best of Conan Doyle's were.... It's a detective story that plays out very close to home,on the streets and corners that Ide (who grew up in South Central) knows best. And Isaiah fits into those streets
like they were made for him. A consulting detective for a time and a place that needs one."â Jason Sheehan ,
NPR - 
"IQ delivers a moving, yet action-packed plot that never disappoints as it looks at rap music, a community…
