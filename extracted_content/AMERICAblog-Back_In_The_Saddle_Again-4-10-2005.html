4/10/2005 11:20:00 AMI've finally overcome my numerous computer troubles -- yourgenerosity helped me (attempt to) retrieve data lost on mycollapsed hard drive, rebuild my system, install new protectionand finally buy that back-up harddrive (a Maxtor One Touch II)to make sure any problems in the future are less devastating.Of course the new virus and firewall software I bought (Norton)was recommended by my internet provider and STILL isn'tcompatible. (To send email, I have to lower my firewall eachtime.) But I'm sure I'll have my problems worked out in thenext year or so.My only regret? I couldn't afford to go Mac.Thanks again to everyone who chipped in. I feel really behindin my comments, so now about Terri Schiavo....
