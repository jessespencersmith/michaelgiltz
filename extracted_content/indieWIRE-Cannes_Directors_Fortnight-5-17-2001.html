CANNES 2001: Directors Fortnight Out of the 
Shadows; Albania's "Slogans" Stands Out 
by Michael Giltz 
(indieWIREI 05.17.01) -Ah, sibling rivalry. Now in ils 33rd 
year. the Directors Fortnight -or Ouinzaine des 
Realisateur s -is a thoroughly separate event from the main 
competition at the 54th Cannes Film Festival. Founded in 
1968 by revolting filmmakers, among them Francois Truffaut 
and Jean·Luc Godard (screening this year in the official 
competition!), the non-competitive sidebar remains always the 
kid brother, often put down by its older, stronger sibling. The 
Fortnight isn't mentioned on the main festival web page or in 
the main festival catalog (all it can offer is a modest booklet). 
That second-class status also extends to the trades. which 
don't review the Directors Fortnight movies as thoroughly . The 
end result? It's harder to get a bead on which of its movies are 
catching the fancy of fest goers. 
But some trends are clear: the Directors Fortnight is usually 
more successful at offering popular opening and closing night 
movies and this year is no exception. The opener­
"MarthaaMartha " by young French director Sandrine 
Veysset -has enjoyed respectable reviews for its depiction of 
a none·too~fit young mother (Valerie Donzelli) who mayor 
may not hurt herself and her child. While generally not 
considered as strong as her debut "Y aura·t·iI de la nelge a 
Noel?" ("Will It Snow For Christmas? "). it still has some strong 
female performances and the benefit of being very French 
indeed. 
The closer -Amos Kollek's "Queenie in Love" -hasn't 
been widely seen yet. But this auteur. who films regularly in 
New Yort<.. is deeply admired in France. I watched in 
astonishment last year as his trifling, bland romantic comedy 
"Fast Food, Fast Women" received rapturous applause when 
it screened in the main competition. Since "Queenie " is 
apparently in a similar vein, there's every reason to expect a 
similar reaction. (Cannes is nothing if not loyal to its directors.) If./I~( 1H( AClI% 10

(DISCUSS) 
I need yoo, 
feedback aOOuI t , 
:t.Q!.!!lg F'm lover!</p>
<p>Sandwiched between those two are some promising entries. 
But first, on to the American movies: 
Ethan Hawke's "Chelsea Walls" was roundly dismissed, 
though Robert Sean Leonard' s charming singing voice does 
lead one to fancifully hope he and Ewan McGregor will record 
a duet. 
Faring better was Arliss Howard's debut "Big Bad Love." 
Based on the short stories of Mississippi writer Larry Brown, 
it stars Howard as a bitter Vietnam vet who's been rejected by 
his wife (real-life spouse Oebra Winger) and by agents 
uninterested in his fiction, Shambling and overlong (which 
hasn't generally been a problem this festival, whem many 
movies have clocked in well under two hours), "Big Bad Love" 
develops some well-earned power once mal tragedy strikes. II 
even earned some comparisons in the trades to Ed Harris's 
"Pollock." 
Even stronger feelings emerged for "The Deep End," a well· 
known quantity since it has appeared elsewhere. Tilda 
Swinton stars as the ideal mom if you're planning to come out 
as a queer and a killer. When the lover of her gay teen son 
washes up on the beach, she takes care of it. Even blackmail 
from a stranger (Goran Visnjic) is a mere bump in the road 
for this tigress. 
The U.S. also featured prominently in two French 
documentaries. "La Traverse e" ("The Crossing"), by French 
director Sebastien Lifshitz ("Come Undone"), is a modest, 
politely received look at a young man convinced by a 
filmmaker friend to go to the U.S. and try and lrack down the 
American G.t. father he's never met. Much less successful is 
Solveig Anspach and Cindy Babski's woeful worK "Made in 
the USA." This would-be "Thin Blue Line" awkwardly 
attempts to convince us that convicted killer Odell Barnes is 
innocent. In doing so, it also tries to condemn the American 
system of justice and indeed America itself. 
"Made in the USA" begins with a description of the crime and 
Barnes's execution. Desperate for images -since Odell 
remains mostly off-screen -they pan from a clock to a prison 
wall while a voiceover solemnly describes what is happening 
inside the prison. Other random shots of the streets of the 
small Texas town repeat throughout. Virtually no one they 
speak 10 is articulate or interesting -not the prosecutors, not 
the defense, not friends or family members. The evidence in 
Bames' favor Isn'llerribly convincing either -even for an 
adamant anti-capital punishment person like myself. Worse, 
by the end of this tiring film. you don't even CARE whether 
Barnes suffered a miscarriage of justice: you feel like you're 
suffering through one yourself. 
little better was"' Noslrl Annl" ("The Years of Our lives"),

for Its visual look as for its "political potential." That should 
nave been waming enough -and this black and white story of 
old Italian men remembering their days I'lghting in the 
resistance during World War II only confirmed it. Made on a 
shoestring and it shows: the flashback scenes of actors 
running through the woods and clutching their guns are 
especially unconvincing. 
Also disappointing was "Hushl" from Japanese director 
Hashlguchl Ryosuke. His earlier drama about gay youths-
1996's "Like Grains of Sand" -was convincing, if eamest. 
This follow·up tells what should be a lighthearted story: two 
young gay men in Tokyo (one out to his family and coworkers; 
the other closeted) are approached by a female friend who 
wants them to help her have a baby. Ryosuke maintains a 
deft touch for the first 10 minutes or so, but it takes him 
forever to set up the basic premise of the film. Worse, he 
reverts to heavy·handed drama with uninvolving subplots 
about the death of a relative and a cowor1<er of one of the gay 
men who becomes obsessed with marrying him. The light 
tone retums briefly towards the end, but it's too late. Even gay 
audiences won't have much patience for this one. 
Certain to do much better at the box offICe is the sentimental if 
effective "Pauline et Paulette: by Belgian Lieven 
Oebrauwer. This gentle drama shows what happens to the 
mentally challenged Pauline when one of her sisters dies. The 
will stipulates that all the money goes to the care of Pauline 
unless one of the other sisters takes her in. Paulette does, 
only as a slop gap measure of course. and some laughter and 
tears and hugging ultimately ensue. Well-acted, it's the sort of 
f~m thai might be unbearable in English but seems eaSier to 
swallow in a foreign tongue. 
Two other films received more mixed reactions. Christine 
Jeffs highly anticipated "Rain" Is a New Zealand entry (al"\d 
thus probably feels overshadowed by the hoopla for that other 
NZ·based production "The L.ord of the Rings.") Set In 1972, 
it tells of a disaffected teenage girl who sets out to seduce the 
photographer boyfriend of her mother. 1\ was generally 
relegated to the catBgOl"y of "pmmising," though some trades 
pegged it to gain a ~mited artnouse release. Even fainter 
praise greeted Khaled Ghorbal's "Fatma: a look at the lives 
of women in Tunisia. like the Inexplicably praised main 
competition film "Safar e Gandehar" ("Kandahar"). it seemed 
admired more for its politics than its filmmaking . 
But one Cinderella story did emerge from the Directors 
Fortnight: "Slogans," the first Albanian film to appear et 
Cannes, was rightly described by a presenter as a "miracle" 
that popped up at the last minute. Tightly directed by Gjargl 
Xhuvanl, it deftly mines the humor and pathos of a young 
schoolteacher who arrives in a tiny mountain town In the late 
'70,,-</p>
<p>One of their main tasks -even more Important than teaching, 
it seems -Is organizing the students into groups, taking them 
into the hills and spelling out revolutionary sk>gans with heavy 
rocks they must then paint white. Teachers out of favor with 
the local politicos naturally get longer slogans, meaning more 
backbreak ing work for their kids, 
What's most admirable is the movie's refusal to exaggerate : 
we see the pettiness of people in power, but they're not made 
to be buffoons or overly evil. Even more painfully. we see the 
heartbreaking compromising of the teacher (and everyone 
around him) just to get by. That makes the bleak, unhopeful 
ending -which simply reflects the reality that life goes on -all 
the more powerful. 
To top it off. ·Slogans· even had one of the best-reviewed 
parties of Ihe entire festival, thanks to Albanian punch, stuffed 
vine leaves and other specialties . Sometimes. dreams really 
do come true,
