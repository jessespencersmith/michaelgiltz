(f) teven Sater is running a little late rushing from the 
Eugene O'Neill Theatre to talk about the musical 
"Spring Awakening," which opens today after a long 
journey fraught with delays. 
"IJust added an intro to the last song, 
'The Song of Purple Summer,''' explains 
Sater. who wrote the show's book and 
Ivrics Bttt Broadway musicals are like 
puzzles, and altering one Inoment can 
have a cascade effect. "We needed to 
change the music. and then we needed to 
change the lyrics But we got through it." 
This final bit of tweaking - a luxury fOI

seven years -is the favorite moment for 
director Michael Mayer, the Tony·nomi·

of Living" and "My Junk" with lusty plea­
sure. Slyly pulling out a wireless micro­
phone to sing becomes an act of rebellion 
Though the music is sophisticated 
enough to please any Stephen Sondheim 
fan, Gramuly-winning musician Duncan 
Sheik was determined -in his first stage 
effort -not to try and change the subtle, 
Nick Drake-flavored yearning of his rock 
albums to fit what some might imagine a 
Broadway musical should sound like.

who has grown from the pop 
artist behind the hit song "It's really fun," says 
Mayer. "I love this pro­

is firmly in place. the per­

Broadway is waiting to see if that tin­

that will bring more real, live young peo­
ple to Ihe Great 'W11ite Way. 
Based on a scandalous 1891 play, it de­
[.licts the stultifying life of teenagers in

"It WflS definilely Ollr idea that the 
mu'ie r 'Spring AI akel'ung ' should be 
Ihe alrernative rock music of [he day, 
and to be slt icl with ourselves about 
not letting it turn into something more 
traditional," says Sheik, "There are many 
Broadway shows that have been intlu- . 
ential on me, like 'Porgy and Bess' and 
Sweeney Todd,' and certainly there have 
been recent shows that influenced us 
"So it's not like we're not influenced 
by Broadway, but stylistically, we want­
ed to make sure the music was going to 
be really relevant to 20-and 30-year-olds 
and teenagers" If the show clicks, it will be a sweet 
finale to a sometimes torturous journey. 
It began with a workshop in La lalla, Ca­
lif • in 1999, which led to more work­
shops and then a turn at the Roundabout 
in 2001, where plans to take the show to 
Broadway were deralled by Sept. I i and 
financial and ~11istic demands . 
"It was heartbl eaking at the time," 
says Sater, who has written a number 
of plays. notably "Carbondale Dreams" 
and, in collahoration wilh musician Lau­
rie Anderson. a version of "The Tem­
pest" "Then, after three years, times had 
changed . It was post-9/11 but also post­
'Hairspray.' People wanted fun. and we 
were a pretty dark show" 
But that delay proved a blessing, ac­
cording to Mayer. 
'We really wanted to put the show on 
before," says Mayet: "But it would not have 
been as good if we hadn't had all this time 
Because we never stopped working All the 
-' time it was on hiatus, we kept adding.' 
And now Sheik, whose album sales 
of late have not matched his critical ac­
claim, may very well find his higgest au­
dience yet in a place he never expected 
to be: Broadway 
"1 think I've learned a lot about lyric 
writing from Steven. because he's so 
immersed in the world of words." says 
Sheik "Steven is so prolific as " lyricist 
and I'm more prolific with music. so it 
does allow me to create a 101 more Ihan

He laughs. "Honestly. i have 10 say it'
