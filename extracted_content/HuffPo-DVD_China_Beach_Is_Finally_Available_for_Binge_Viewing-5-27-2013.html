            <p>DVD:  China  Beach   Is  Finally  Available
for  Binge  Viewing
It seems like every TV show ever made is out on DVD or streaming on demand. But that's
far from true. China  Beach  is the latest show fans have been eagerly anticipating to finally
get the boxed set it deserves. But many more shows are still waiting. Where's all of HillStreet  Blues  and I'll  Fly  Away  and The  Wonder  Years  and St.  Elsewhere,  just to name a
few? What shows are you dying to see released in full so you can watch it from beginningto end?
CHINA  BEACH  THE  COMPLETESERIES  ($199.95 DVD; TimeLife) - Well,
it took forever (blame the music) but whenthey finally did it, they did it right. Belovedcult drama China Beach is finally out in agorgeous boxed set that includes all 62episodes on 21 discs, along with hours andhours of reunions, bonus features,commentary tracks and more. It's allhoused in an impressive and handsomebox that's attractive but compact which fitseasily alongside the other shows in yourcollection. For now, the set is availabledirectly from TimeLife  though eventually it
will come to other outlets.
Why did it take so long? The songs. The
show was bursting with pop music of the
era and it's very hard to get clearances to
use them again on DVD. (Any music publisher/artist who demands exorbitant amounts is
an idiot, by the way.) It's the same reason The  Wonder  Years  is lost in limbo.
China  Beach  was sort of a serious spin on M*A*S*H, the comedy set in Korea. it was an
hour long drama that looked at the nurses and doctors and patients surrounding a MASH
unit located near a great beach complete with lifeguard. The iconic opening scene showedDana Delany looking very sexy as she sat out in the sun in a red bathing suit, only to havea helicopter zoom overhead and the audience realize she's a nurse in a war zone. The brieffirst season was earnest and awkward, due to unfortunate comic relief in a USO singer-wannabe. But John Wells (of ER) took the reins in season two and the show grew by leapsand bounds. The series would score three nominations for Best Drama and Delany wouldwin Best Actress twice.
It was never close to a popular hit, which was all to the good. Like St. Elsewhere, it was a
critics' darling that stayed under the radar and could do what it wanted. The show becameincreasingly bold, using complicated structures for some scenes, flash-forwards to life

<p>after these soldiers returned home, documentary interviews with nurses and others
interspersed with fictional scenes and even a cast visit to the Vietnam Memorial.
I haven't finished watching it yet but have the feeling they could have gone one more year
to fully tackle the stateside lives of these veterans and Colleen McMurphy in particular.But there's a lot of TV here and they continued to get bolder and better and how manyshows can say that?
SUPERMAN  UNBOUND  ($24.99 BluRay;
Warner Bros.)STAR  TREK  THE  NEXT  GENERATION  SEASON  THREE  ($129.99 BluRay;
Paramount)DOCTOR  WHO  SEASON  SEVEN  PART  TWO  ($24.99 DVD; BBC)
DOCTOR  WHO  THE  VISITATION  ($34.99 DVD; BBC) -- The new Superman movie is
great, you can tell your friends? What? You've seen Man Of Steel? No, you've seen thenew animated movie Superman Unbound, with Matt Bomer voicing Superman as he andSupergirl battle the evil Braniac. It's brisk, fun, and if the new movie is this smart andenjoyable, we'll be very lucky indeed.
Certainly the new Star  Trek  movie is a disappointment. It's fine if you're a fan but it's not
as good as the reboot and feels lazy with all the in-jokes, not to mention Tribbles, Khan,
and a wholly unearned nod to veterans in the credits crawl. It's not a patch on seasonthree of Star  Trek  The  Next  Generation , the season when the show escaped the shadow of
the original series and hit true greatness. Frankly, it was never quite this good again, but</p>
<p>what a season, filled with Q and Data becoming more human and no more empaths (okay,
just briefly) and the Borg at the finale. This season was remastered in-house so it's up to
the standards of season one on BluRay. Of course, they're doing this all wrong. They
should have released a boxed set in both BluRay and DVD for the entire series and then
released individual seasons. As it is, this will be awfully pricey even on sale if you buy all
seven seasons.
Doctor  Who  keeps chugging along nicely. Part 2 of Season 7 was certainly better than the
tepid part one. But it's still not a patch on Season 6 which had a very ambitious season-
long arc that built and built and built to a thunderous finale. Frankly, after that season,
they need to keep doing season long arcs or the stand-alones will have to be tremendously
good. They weren't even close in the first half, though the quality is better here.
Nonetheless, the reveal of the origin of his Impossible Girl Clara barely withstood the
season-long buildup. Thank God it was given a jolt at the end with a big reveal teasing the90 minute special we'll be seeing in November to celebrate the 50th anniversary.
As for The  Visitation , the arc from the Peter Davison years is like all the other BBC
releases: filled with copious extras that are an embarrassment of riches. Davison just
missed being my first Doctor (that was Tom Baker) but I like him from All Creatures
Great And Small and he has an amiable air. Again and again, I say, release comprehensiveboxed sets devoted to each Doctor. This parceling out of episodes is annoying and $35 listfor 95 minutes of television is absurd for a 30 year old collection of four episodes.
LIBERACE  THE  ULTIMATE  ENTERTAINER  ($12.99 DVD;
Timeless)THE  ROYAL  COLLECTION  ($24.99 DVD; BBC)
YOSSI  ($27.99 DVD; Strand)
COME  UNDONE  ($19.99 DVD; First Run Features) --
Whatever you think of the HBO movie about Liberace and the</p>
<p>performance by Michael Douglas, it's hard not to get a shiver of
pleasure out of the pure camp of the real Liberace. You get ascattering of shows from the 1960s as well as various extras likehome movies, a look at his wardrobe and Liberace on the historyof the piano. At every moment, he's as campy as campy can be
and you wonder what Middle America made of it all. Talk about hiding in plain sight!
I'm sure even Liberace would have been impressed by the jewels available to Queen
Elizabeth II. Did they meet? I'm sure they did and got along swimmingly since both knew
the importance of spectacle while maintaining a discreet distance especially in matters
personal. This cardboard boxed set is just a simple way to package four titles alreadyavailable: Queen  Victoria's  Children,  King  George  &  Queen  Mary,  The  Coronation  of
Queen  Elizabeth  II  and How  To  Be  A  Prince.  As a bonus you get a facsimile of the
Queen's Coronation Day booklet souvenir. It's certainly a bargain price but if you own
these titles the packaging and booklet are definitely not worth the extra money.
I didn't know I wanted a sequel to the lovely Israeli film Yossi  &  Jagger , but all these
years later here it is. Yossi is still closeted and stuck emotionally until a young out soldier
shakes him out of his doldrums and shows Yossi it's a new world. Director Eytan Fox
continues to reveal the world of gay Israel in unexpected and fascinating ways.
Finally if Yossi intrigues you, you're sure to enjoy the now classic gay coming of age tale
Come  Undone.  It's the sexy and sweet story of a young man on holiday at a seaside town
in France who comes alive (and undone) a lot quicker than Yossi could ever have
imagined. Not a truly great film overall, but for fans of the genre an essential one.
SWIMMINGTOCAMBODIA($19.99 DVD;Shout)AMERICANMASTERS:MEL
BROOKS  --  MAKE  A  NOISE  ($19.99 DVD; Shout)
BILL  MOYERS  BEYOND  HATE  ($34.99 DVD; Athena)
SOLDIERS  OF  PAINT  ($ DVD; First Run Features) --
Spalding Gray was a singular talent, a man who came into aroom and sat down at a table and told a story. In the case ofSwimming  To  Cambodia,  it revolved around the making of the
film The  Killing  Fields  in which Gray had a small role. He created
these monologues throughout his career and it's tempting tothink how easy it must be to capture them on film. How can youmess it up? But in fact it's exceptionally difficult to avoid justtaping a live performance, a record of what he did and actually
creating a genuine film. You could give a master class examining the lighting and soundand camera work and editing that goes into turning director Jonathan Demme's movieinto a masterpiece. Or you could just have a ball watching it and laughing your ass off.</p>
<p>Mel Brooks knew a lot about making people laugh their asses off (fart jokes were always a
good start). He's enjoying a victory lap, including this American Masters special that takesa look at his 60 year career from writer to live performer to film director and producer tomusical theater impresario. He did it all, funnily enough.
Every major talent is irreplaceable. Who can do what Mel Brooks has done? I hope no one
tries. But I shudder to think of television without Bill Moyers. When he retired, there wasa black hole in television where thoughtful, impassioned discourse used to be. Now he'sback and thank God. The special Beyond  Hate  looks at that virulent emotion in its many
forms, wondering if we can rid ourselves of it, wondering what its positive purpose mustbe (otherwise why would it exist) and talking to people who've dealt with hate, people likeElie Siesel, Nelson Mandela, Vaclav Havel, Jimmy Carter and more. As usual for Moyers,it's thought-provoking, entertaining and no one else in the world would have even
considered making it much less making it this well. (P.S. I'm available to substitute for
Moyers on his show Moyers  &  Company  whenever he needs a break. IN promise not to
get as vulgar as Moyers, who recently said, "Free speech my foot!" which in the context of
his show sounded like the angriest put-down I'd heard in years. :)
Weekend warriors and anyone who has ever developed a serious strategy for laser tag will
enjoy Soldiers  of  Paint,  an amusing look at an annual event in which 5000 (!) volunteers
re-stage D-Day on a 700 acre plot of land in Oklahoma and each side is free to employ
any strategy available to the generals at the time. In other words, there are no guarantees
about who will win. A good chunk of extras for a rather modest little film.
BEETLEJUICE  THE  COMPLETE  SERIES  ($99.99 DVD;
SHOUT) -- Modestly related to the movie, this animated series
was such a big hit on TV that it was briefly on ABC everySaturday and on Fox during weekday afternoons. Beetlejuice istoned down quite a bit from the film. not surprisingly. Here heis best pals with goth girl Lydia and they spend a lot of theirtime in the Neitherworld, where parodies of movies and booksand TV shows abound (especially later in the show's run). Itran for four years and Shout has happily collected all 94episodes in one tidy boxed set. No extras but really, fans are lucky to have the showavailable in one nice package when other companies would have churned out two releasesfrom each season (and four from the final, lengthy one) for a total of 10 releases. Even at$20 each, that would have been $200, a lot more than the $100 list price here. And it'savailable on sale for less.
GEORGE  GENTLY  SERIES  1-4  ($99.99 DVD; Acorn)</p>
<p>GEORGE  GENTLY  SERIES  5  ($59.99 DVD; Acorn) -- This solid but second-tier
British crime show is a period piece set in the North of England in the 1960s. Martin
Shaw plays the Scotland Yard inspector now stuck in the hinterlands. Lee Ingleby is his
sidekick, a close-minded and far less intuitive fellow who hates the way the world is
changing with women and others not keeping to their place. It's a solid show but at $60
for four TV movies in Series 5, you're clearly better off just getting the first four series or
waiting until the entire series comes out in one set. $15 an episode is a bit rich though
fans of British whodunits will enjoy the setting and Shaw's performance in particular.

<p>30  Rock  has never been a favorite of mine. I find the characters too cartoonish. But kudos
to Tina Fey for calling it a day after season seven, the same number of seasons as The
Mary Tyler Moore Show, her clear role model. No sitcom ever got better after sevenseasons and frankly none even maintained their quality except for The  Simpsons , which
would be the greatest sitcom of all time if it had ended 13 years ago. So even though NBCsurely would have loved another year of the low-rated but critically acclaimed series, Feyhad the class to pull the plug. Well done.
Dexter  on the other hand reached the perfect series finale when he met his soul mate
Julia Stiles in season five. Instead they chose to avoid pairing them off and seeing what
happened or calling it a day at the right moment creatively. They've now said Season Eightwill the capper but it's too late. Maintaining a series about a serial killer for five seasonswas simply brilliant but they've marred the legacy somewhat by producing 60% moreepisodes. It doesn't change the fact that Michael C Hall should have won the Emmy forBest Actor years ago. But that was years ago.
The  Dick  Van  Dyke  Show  actually got a little tired in its fifth season when they called it a
day. But that was when sitcoms would churn out 30 episodes a season. They made 158
whereas 30  Rock  would need eight years to match that total. But they ran for five years,
broke into the Top 10 in season two, peaked at #3 in season three and when they slipped
out of the Top 10 to #16 in season five they said goodbye. The show won 15 Emmys but
only won Best Comedy in that fifth and final season. Now that's going out on top -- the
second you see a tiny slip in ratings and creativity, you go home. Countless shows wouldmirror its dual emphasis on family and work as family.
Have  Gun  Will  Travel  isn't a perfect example of good timing, but hey, TV stars are only
human. This amusing Western with gun for hire Paladin as its lead was an immediate
smash hit. It aired for five years on Saturday night at 9:30, right before Gunsmoke .
Richard Boone played the lead all five years and never had a better role. It hit #4 its first
season, #3 for the next two seasons and then dropped to #29 or so, even though in its
final season its lead-in The  Defenders  was the strongest support the show ever had,
ranking at #18. Sure Gunsmoke  had faded from the #1 slot, but it was still potent. Still,
they didn't moan their fate or dragged it out. Three smash years and two solid ones andPaladin rode off into the sunset.
Felicity  was never a big hit -- it ranked #123 in its peak year of season three (though
season one reached the most viewers). But it was a show about college and to actually
have it last four years -- freshman, sophomore, junior and senior -- was pretty amazing(and certainly not realistic, if my epic college journey is any indication). Yes, it was a popculture phenomenon and had clearly reached its sell-by date. But it's rare for the team torealize that. Instead of following Felicity into the real world, it resolved the romantictriangle at the heart of the series, took its degree and cleaned out of the dorm once andfor all. These DVD sets are especially inexpensive, which is exactly what every older TVshow should strive for. If it means keeping prices down, we can do without extras, thankyou. Now let's see how long Keri Russell sticks with her high concept series TheAmericans, another show that most definitely should not drag itself out more than aboutfour years.
We could all learn a lesson from the Brits. Ever since Fawlty Towers (if not sooner), the
Brits have been eager to prize quality over quantity. They often do just a few episodes at atime, rest, and then after a year or two tackle some more. The Office is a prime recentexample. Twelve episodes, two specials and its one of the greatest sitcoms of all time thatthe American version with its 9 seasons and 201 (!) episodes couldn't hold a candle to.(They'd be the first to agree.) So here we have the charming romantic comedy A FineRomance. It stars the great Judi Dench and her real-life partner Michael Williams as twomiddle-aged people embarking on a new relationship. True, they made four seasons rightin a row, but they only made 6 or 7 episodes each year. That adds up to 26 episodes, justenough to tell the story they wanted to tell and be done with it. Jolly good, in every sense.
