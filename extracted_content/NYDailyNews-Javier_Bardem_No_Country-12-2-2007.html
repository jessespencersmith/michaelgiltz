            <p>ctor Javier Bardem is used to accolades. He has enough
Goyas - the Spanish Oscar - to serve as legs for a cof-
fee table. And he has been showered with attention
since bursting onto the international scene with "Before
Night Falls" in 2000.
Now he has turned blood cold as a relentless assassin in the
Coen brothers drama "No Country for Old Men" while warm-
ing hearts in the romance "Love in the Time of Cholera," a de-
cades-spanning adaptation of the Gabriel Garcia Marquez mas-
terpiece. Earlier this year, he starred in Milos Forman's drama
"Goya's Ghosts," and coming up is Woody Allen's "Vicky Cristi-
na Barcelona," due next year.
And the buzz sunounding Bardem for :
his chillingly focused portrayal of enig-
matic hit man Anton Chigurh in "Ne :
Country" means he'll be busy working the :
awards circuit for months to come Hap-

actor keep it in perspective
"The facl thal l m from Spain gives me
a perspective that is more sane," says Bar-
dem, a member of an acting dynasty that's l
the Spanish equivalent ofthe Barrymores.
"i can lputl myself in a place that is more :
distmt from all the things that may go
around this movie or any other movie It's
like a hutricme of echoes that you don't i
want to listen to."
Bardem notes of course that the atten- |
tion on him helps the films gain an audi- i
ence And,ofcourse,noactorshiesfrom i

says Bardem with good humor, "Atd I'm
