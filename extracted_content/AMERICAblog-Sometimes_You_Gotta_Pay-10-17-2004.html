10/17/2004 01:32:00 AMNot everything is available for free on the Internet. (Or, if you prefer,the Internets.)Harper's Oct. issue has a cover story/essay on the 9/11 CommissionReport that runs counter to most other opinions. It's well worthreading. Writer Benjamin DeMott argues convincingly that theCommission's report is a whitewash -- they decided that everyonewould share blame and therefore no one must shoulder the blame, notough questions are asked and no one is taken to task by them.Specifically, he says that Bush lied to the commission and the nation.And they let him.Bush lied when he said the August 6 Daily brief was "historical innature" when in fact it detailed current, active threats. Bush liedwhen no one told him there were Al Quaeda cells in the US. TheAugust 6 report says so specifically; the acting deputy director of theCIA, John McLaughlin, and deputy chief of the CIA's CounterterrorismCenter, Ben Bonk told Bush in September of 2000 BEFORE HE WONTHE ELECTION that Americans would die in an attack by or inspiredby Bin Laden; and the Bush/Cheney transition team was told that AlQuaeda had sleeper cells in more than 40 countries, including theU.S. There is more, of course.DeMott feels that the Commission felt the country couldn't handle adirect grilling of Bush, of watching the President called on his lies --they feared being seen as partisan and perhaps having theirsuggestions which could make a difference being dismissed aspartisan. And so they let Bush go unchallenged and let his lies stand.
