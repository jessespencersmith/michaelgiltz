 19Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyIdol  Season 9: Top 4 -- Big Goodbye

Well, it was probably a close call, but Michael Lynche
is headed home from American Idol while Casey
James makes it into the top 3 alongside Lee Dewyze
and front-runner Crystal Bowersox (who hasn't won athing yet, so you've got to keep voting).
In an oddly structured evening in which three big acts
came out and did solid performances of so-so songs,we found out first that Casey James was safe.
Naturally, that meant the only suspense would be if
Lee was going home but then he was announced assafe too. That left Michael and Crystal, though Ryan
Seacrest had been careful at the top of the show to
announce the results were presented in "no particular order." So why group Michael and Crystal as the
faux "bottom two?" It just meant everyone knew that Michael was going home after the first 10 minutes
of the show but wouldn't know for certain until the end. He then reprised "Will You Be There" and if
Michael had been that forceful and focused on performance night, he'd probably still be in it. Of all thecontestants who got to sing in defiance of going home, Michael can take comfort in delivering the most.
So is it clear cut that Crystal and Lee will be the finalists or can Casey sneak in there? And is it foolish to
think Crystal is a lock when last season most people thought Adam Lambert was a lock over Kris Allen?

This season of American Idol is a joke. I am offically beating that Lee will take the Crown this year,
Why? Because just like Taylor Hicks they are grooming him to win. If anyone STILL thinks thatAmerican Idol is not staged then they must be young enough to have Justin Bieber posters overtheir beds.
Yes, it has been a weak season for Idol.....
But thank heavens, our long national nightmare is over .... FINALLY: 
"Taylor Swift Getting Honored By Songwriter s' Hall Of Fame"
http://www .huffingto npost.com/ 2010/05/11 /taylor-sw ift-gettin g-into_n_5 71804.html
And what were they thinking to take this long? She had to put out a second album before theycame to their senses and decided her long career and lifetime achievemen t made her Hall of Fame
material.
"Phil Collins and music producer Phil Ramone also will receive special awards at the event. Other
inductees include Leonard Cohen...."
Come on, what have Phil Collins, Phil Ramone, and Leonard Cohen ever done to be worthy of
being honored alongside Ms. Swift????? ?
By the way, I hope they don't tell Kanye where the ceremonies will be staged.

311 FansI think I am done with Idol. Casey over Big Mike. This season was painful and I think Idol has worn
out its welcome. Don't think I will be going forward into the next season. Rather tired of the same olthing.
I think the fact that this is our top three speaks greatly to the level of talent this year. With the
exception of Crystal. As far as Lee goes, I hope he can write songs. He looks and sounds sort oflike Bob Dylan, has Dylan's stage mannerisms , so if he can write like Dylan, he could have the most
prolific career ever. As for Casey, if I had a pool in my back yard, he would be my pool boy. Oh hellyes! Maybe he can write songs too.Bottom line, Crystal should win. But she is an un-wed mother, so the God Squad could come afterher also!
Overall, a disappoint ing season...
Seacrest Out! Please!
All Lee has to do is write like Dylan? :) True. Too bad no one's been able to do it as well in
50 years. Since Fantasia won, I'm hoping people won't diss Crystal for her personal life.
Excellent point about Fantasia who now looks whole and happy btw-hope she trulyis.
I have dissed Lee all season. And then I heard samples from his album Slumberlan d. The
album's really good. he doesn't invoke Dylan, but he's good in his own right.
As previously stated, only thing I care about is when she breaks out the Bonnie Raitt! lol. I signed up for the trip so I'll ride it through to the end.
Maybe they can just film Crystal's concert back home and run that !
I gave up caring when I saw that everybody they cast this year looked ready made for a photoshoot
. Fantasia, Jennifer Hudson, even the heavier Kelly Clarkson would never have made it into thisyears group. And consequent ly the talent suffered for it. Crystal is good, but how would she have
fared a few seasons ago competitin g against the contestant s from other years on "Disco Night"?

59 FansOh, forgot to mention... Interestin gly, American Idol has put up a rather lengthy survey on it's main
AI Board page. Lots of digging around about judges, format, guest judges, themes, etc. Haven't
seen it mentioned here, that I can recall (could have missed it - sorry). Just thought I'd post on it incase anyone is interested in going over to check it out. I would LOVE to see them publish theresults, which, of course, they won't.
Thanks! I'll check it out.
Our reaction to Ryan's faux Bottom 2 was the same as yours. He kind of flubbed that, jmho. If hehad put Michael in with Lee or Casey, there would have been some suspense, but the minute hepaired up Michael with Crystal, everyone knew exactly how it was going to go, including poorMichael. 
As for Michael going home, I felt bad for him. He's very talented; again, jmho. I hope someone picks
him up on a contract. I'd like to see what kind of a CD he would put out. (Yeah, I know, I know...ITune and Rhapsody downloads, but some of us STILL will buy the entire CD, if it's good.)Whatever, it's that point in the season where someone's gonna go, good or not. C'est la guerre.
I'm absolutely certain Michael Lynche will get a record deal and have at least one stab atsuccess. The nice thing about not winning is you don't get rushed. So maybe he'll be ableto meet your expectatio ns. Thanks for commenting .
I think this season's starting to wrap up as almost everyone had assumed... and next week will
probably launch Lee and Crystal into the final two for the finale. While Casey may have a shot ofbreaking it up, it's looking tough unless things change momentum-w ise quickly. Of course, there is
also always a chance that we don't know who's really getting the most votes, but since Lee andCrystal have never been in the bottom 3, I'm going to guess it's them. http://the smogger.co

Great piece, Allen24. I agree with all your ideas. One more though: Get rid of Randy Jackson.Indeed, he is truly awful this year. But let's be honest, he never really offered much in terms ofconstructi ve criticism or personalit y. He should have been ditched years ago with Dunkelman.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

166 FansDitched with Dunkelman? Ouch!
Casey goes on and Mike goes home! Whatever American Idol is, it's certainly not a talent contest. 
Just where is the talent of Casey James -- let alone any charisma? Teen and tween voting makes
Idol a travesty.
Another one bites the dust! Thank goodness Big Mike is gone!
To be honest though - apart from Crystal I really don't care who goes home and when!
I am such a huge Idol fan but this year has been a crushing disappoint ment - weak contestant s,
bad show themes, disappoint ing eliminatio ns, checked out judges... I recently wrote a piece on the
show - Fallen Idol - with 7 ways to turn the show around ahead of Season 10. Boy, does Idol need
it!
http://www .remotepat rolled.com /2010/04/f allen-idol /
We liked Michael Lynche. Apart from that, I agree with the rest of your remarks, except I
don't even really care if Crystal goes. Not that invested in her. I think she has talent, butcan't help but wonder how she will do out in the real world once Idol is over. No question,she's had a few very good moments, but she has also had some really blah ones, as well.As you pointed out, this has been a really poor season, so I'm wondering if we're justlooking at the best of the worst? I guess time will tell.
