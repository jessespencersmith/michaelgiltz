for best 
TV on DVD 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
Ten years ago. the only TV 
shows available on nVD were 
sci-fi cult shows like "Star 
Trek" and the occasional 
miniseries. Now literally everything 
is nooding onto DVD: this Jail. YOLI 
can find .:mything from classic 
... "LEAVE IT TO BEAVER" FIRST SEASON LIMITED EDITION 
Universal; $69.98: Out now Dal !:ora Strcisand TV specials to a 
mid·seasoll compilation of episodes 
from "Battles tar: GaJactica ." So 
whether you're buying J gift ur 
huying to catch up on a f:woritl', 
hel e arc the ritles out nnw and 
cumillg soun you'll wanl to kt'l.'r an 
TV's first realistic depiction of kids -they keep secrets from their 
parents, avoid baths, and generally behave like actual children -
remains disarmingly clever and sweet. The must-have limited edition 
includes a lunch box and family photo 
t· "THE ROCKFORD FILES" 
SEASON ONE 
Universal; $39.98; Out Dec. 6 
If "Barney Miller" set the standard 
for realistic cop shows, James 
Garner's hapless private eye set 
the standard for real detective 
work. Rockford often got beat up, 
,was confused about whodunit 
;and always 'struggled to pay his 
~·bills. A genuine classic. 
<1II"TOUR OF DUTY" 
ENTIRE SERIES A "THE GOLDEN GIRLS" 
THIRD SEASON 
'J" 
-, -- . I Sony: $121.95; Out Dec. 13 Buena Vista: $39.99: Out now 
Those sassy, sexy old gals are as 
amusing and popular as ever 
especially among young people. No 
TV movie reunion, please, but a six­
episode summer run could be fun. 
Until then, here's their most popular 
season with minimal extras (not 
even cheesecake). of this memorable show about soldiers fighting an unpopular 
are encased in a clever metal box. Reminds us of 
we always knew: whatever the war, soldiers pay a heavy price. 
~ "FAMILY GUY" 
VOLUME 3 
Fox; $39.98; Out 
November 29 
This show has come back 
frollllhe dead rnor e times 
than the Mummy. Here you 
get a new balch of episodes 
from the cunent season. 
Now if only they'd kill 
"American Dad." ~ "AEON FLUX" COMPLETE 
ANIMATED COLLECTION 
Paramount; $38.99; Out now 
Betore watching the live-action 
Charlize Theron extravaganza 
(out Dec. 2), why not dig into the 
original animated series that 
ptayed on MTV tate at night. It 
told Ihe gripping slory of a really 
hot assassin and paved the way 
for Cartoon Network's Adult 
Swim. Kim's 'Model' 
behavior 
4NiPiitirni• 
~ "24" SEASON FOUR 
Fox; $69.98; Out Dec. 6 
"Prison Break." "Lost." The upcoming 
"Kidnapped." All these cliffhangers owe 
a debt to Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer 
and this nail-biting drama; the "Perils of 
Pauline" for the new millennium. 
~ "THE SHIELD" 
FOURTH SEASON <II "JACKASS" THE BOX SET 
Paramount: $54.99: Out Dec. 6 
Apparently putting lit firecrackers in 
your butt and stapling signs to your 
buddy's ass can make you a star. Hey, 
it worked for Johnny Knoxville, thanks 
to MTV's dumber-than-dumb stunt 
show. 
Fox: $59.98: Out Dec. 26 
Glenn Close was robbed! She deserved 
an Emmy for going mano-a-mano with 
the gritty, corrupt but maybe 
redeemable Mackey (Michael Chiklis). 
A very under-appreciated dralj1a. 
~BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER 
THE CHOSEN COLLECTION 
Fox: $199.98: Out now 
Quite simply, one of the wittiest, most 
original shows that TV has ever 
produced. Enjoy it as a metaphor for 
teen angst, enjoy it as a monster flick or 
enjoy it as a clever creator of catch­
phrases, But truly, if you watch it, you 
~ will enjoy it. 
~ "BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA" 
Universal; $49.98; 
Out Dec. 20 
For the first time in history, a TV show 
releases new episodes in the middle of 
a season. (More new episodes in 
January.) And no wonder: who can wait 
to watch them again? This is one of the 
most gripping shows on TV, so catch up. 
~ "STAR WARS 
CLONE WARS" 
VOLUME 2 
Fox; $19.98; 
Out Dec. 6 
This rollicking anime 
series takes place 
between the movies "Star 
Wars II" and Star Wars 111." 
And the Force is with it: 
this is much better than 
either of them. 1 ., .. ~</p>
