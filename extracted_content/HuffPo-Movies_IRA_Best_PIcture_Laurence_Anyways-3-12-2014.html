Who are the IRAs? They're a mysterious but august film society that hasvoted on the best films of the year since 1976. More international and indie-focused than the Oscars, moremercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes, the IRAs have justpicked the winners for 2013 and major prizes were scored by Her and Fill The Void. But the big winner is XavierDolan's Laurence Anyways and I couldn't be happier.I first heard about Dolan at the Cannes Film Festival (along with the rest of the cinematic world) when his debut IKilled My Mother scored remarkable attention and positive reviews. A child actor in a string of TV commercials,Dolan self-funded his autobiographical movie and reaped the rewards. A true talent, he followed with a secondadventurous film (Heartbeats) and now the nearly three hour, wildly ambitious and wildly exciting LaurenceAnyways. Dolan is clearly a major talent we'll be hearing from for years to come.Don't take just the IRAs word for it. The film enjoys an 88% rating from top critics at Rotten Tomatoes. The NewYork Times said, "Laurence Anyways, a transgender melodrama spanning 10 years in the life of a love affair, isan astonishing achievement for a filmmaker, Xavier Dolan, who is only 24."The late Roger Ebert wrote, "A gifted writer, Dolan likes to give his characters poignant mouthfuls, and you cantell the actors revel in his language. Recalling a similar instance in Dolan's first feature, I Killed My Mother, thescene where Fred snaps at a nosy waitress is the kind of explosive monologue actors yearn for. There are alsoloads of quippy moments, like during Laurence's coming out to her mother. 'So you still love me?' Laurenceasks. 'Are you turning into a woman or an idiot?' she replies."The Hollywood Reporter says the film is "stylish and original enough to merit an Almodovar-style commercialbreakthrough."So the IRAs are not alone in championing this director, though we've certainly moved on from "promising" -- asso many others still paint Dolan -- to satisfying. It's only in the previous year that his debut even playedcommercially in New York City. But now all three films are available on DVD and the like, so you can catch upquickly and look forward to his next work just as eagerly as us. Here's a trailer for his latest.The IRAs began when passionate film students complained about the annual awards shows, declared "Wecould do better" and had an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to establish the very first winners of the IRAsback in the mid-1970s. (One of the members is named Ira but how his name became the name of the award is astory lost in the mist of time.) The rotating group of members have been profiled in the New Yorker and over theyears have included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio executives, best-selling and criticallyacclaimed biographers, critics and others. This month alone, one IRA member is publishing a major work on theindigenous peoples of the Americas and their broad influence on the world and another is executive producingthe comeback album of Americana pioneer Jimmer Podrasky of The Rave-Ups. They have no more claim topronounce the best films of the year than anyone else but they've been doing it for 39 years so hey, it's tradition.Now here are this year's top winners, followed by the full list of votes, a run-down of the Best Picture Winners inIRA history and links to more info on the group and past year's tallies.2013 IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS</p>
