            <p>Dressed for excess 
With Boy George playing performance artist Leigh Bowery, 
Taboo gave us the year's gayest costumes By Michael Gillz 
roadway offered many queer 
pleasures in 2003: Hugh Jack­
man embodying Peter Allen in 
The Boy From Oz, Robert 
Sean Leonard kissing Scott 
Foley in Richard Greenberg's The Violet 
Hour, Jefferson Mays dazzling as a Ger­
man cross-dresser in I Am My Own 
Wife, the sexually confused puppets in 
the musical Avenue Q. 
But no show's costumes were more 
out there than the giddily over-the-top 
spectacles on display in Boy George's 
Taboo. Designer Mike Nicholls was nom­
inated for an Olivier (Britain's equivalent 
of the Tony) when it opened in London's 
West End, and both he and his Broad­
way collaborator, Bobby Pearce, are 
likely nominees come Tony time. 
Nicholls was very faithful to the spir­
it of designer Leigh Bowery, who creat­
ed his original costumes in the '70s and 
'80s and is played by George in the 
show. A friend of both artists, Nicholls 
shopped for fabrics in the sanle shops Bowery used and then enlisted Bow­
ery's old friends to help with the con­
struction. But for New York, the guid­
ing principle was "bigger and better." 
(That includes the budget, which 
Nicholls says went from about $27,000 
in the United Kingdom to hundreds of 
thousands in New York.) 
"That's where Bobby was so great, 
because Bobby knows Broadway and 
he was able to help me translate that," 
says Nicholls. "The fabrics got more 
glittery, and some shapes got slightly 
exaggerated, even more than they were 
on Leigh." 
Pearce says one of the hardest tasks 
was re-creating these fabulous cos­
tumes for a long-running show. "The 
kids used to put these outfits together 
from stuff they would literally steal or 
pull out of garbage cans," says Pearce, 
who, like Nicholls, is gay. "They'd wear 
them one night, and whatever they 
came home with, they came home 
with. That was the end of that outfit. 
THE ADVOCATE 180 I JANUARY 20, 2004 Some of Bowery's clothes were made 
the same way. It was very difficult for 
us to come up with something that 
would work eight shows a week and 
still look like an original." 
The result is one of Broadway's 
most demanding-and rewarding­
shows from the point of view of a cos­
tume designer. "This show has 237 cos­
tumes, which is an awful lot," says 
Pearce. "I think Phantom of the Opera 
has 225. There's a crew of 12 people 
that come in daily just to maintain the 
costumes." 
With a u.K. road tour scheduled to 
run through July, Taboo is keeping the 
spirit of the attention-getting Bowery 
alive even longer. 
"You could never miss him," says 
Nicholls, who met Bowery in the real 
Taboo club and is referring to his per­
sonality and his towering physique. "He 
would be spinning around and shriek­
ing, so he was a big presence." 
A lesser star might be abashed by 
the prospect of stepping into Bowery's 
platforms. But not Boy George, 
Nicholls says: "Anything that can have 
more glitter and be more extravagant, 
[Boy George 1 is always up for that." •
