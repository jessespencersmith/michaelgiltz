9/08/2005 12:34:00 AMOn Monday, one week after the worst natural disaster in ournation's history, the Washington Post published a light, fluffpiece on Vice President Dick Cheney getting ready to purchasea $2.5 million mansion on Chesapeake Bay. This is the sameVice President who stayed on vacation on Monday and Tuesdayand Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and finally deigned toappear in DC on Saturday for a photo op (we still haven't hearda public comment from him) while thousands died andhundreds of thousands had their homes and lvies swept away.There's a very real possibility Cheney was actually house-shopping for an estate while this disaster was devastating ourcountry.Now we want proof. We know Cheney was on vacation. His ownspokesperson confirmed that to the WaPo. We know he spenttime in Jackson, Wyoming. And you've all seen that photo ofBush goofing around on a guitar while the waters were rising inNew Orleans. We want images of Cheney from the past tendays. If you live in Jackson, Wyoming or near St. Michael's offChesapeake Bay or know someone that does, contact them.Anyone get their photo taken with Dick in the last ten days?Anyone got time-stamped video of Dick from the last ten days?Anyone see him shopping or dining out or checking outexpensive mansions during the last ten days? Anyone go flyfishing with Dick from the last ten days? Give us proof and -- ifwe can confirm it's legit -- you'll see it posted here.
