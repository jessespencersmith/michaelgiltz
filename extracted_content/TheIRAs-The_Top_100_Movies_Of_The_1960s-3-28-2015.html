The IRA Awards: The Best Movies Of The 1960s
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the
best films of the year since 1976. More international and indie focused
than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to
their favorites than the Golden Globes, the IRAs are in the midst of
selecting the best movies released in 2014. The IRAs also  followed up
months of discussion and debate and balloting and re-watching of
DVDs and DVRing of TCM to determine the best films of the 1960s.
Below you'll find the list of the Best Films Of The 1960s.
The IRAs began when passionate film students complained about
annual awards shows, declaring "We could do better!" What followed
was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to establish the very first
winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is named Ira but how his
name became the name of the award is a story lost in the mist of time.)
The rotating group of members known has the IRAs has been profiled
in The New Yorker. Over the years they've included Oscar-winning
writers, major directors, top studio executives, best-selling and
critically acclaimed authors on movies, critics and others. They have no
more claim to pronounce the best films of the year than anyone else but
they've been doing it for decades so hey, it's tradition.
If you're like me, the list of the Best Films of the 1960s will infuriate
you -- some movies should be higher up, some should be lower down
and some shouldn't be on the list at all. That's half the fun. If you're
passionate about movies or TV or books or music or any art form,
chances are you've bristled over awards season and known you and
your friends have better taste.  So why not form your own group? It's
not just fun to hand out awards; it's the best way to make certain your
youthful enthusiasm for TV or music or books or whatever doesn't lose
focus when work and life intrude. When all your friends tell you you
have to read such and such a book or listen to a certain CD before the
annual get-together, guess what? You do! Sometimes homework can be
fun.
How to use this list: scoff at it, argue with it, agree with it, mock it. For
us, the list is not nearly as important as the process. We re-watch some
of our favorite films of the decade, check out movies we've missed but
other members are passionate about, discover some new favorites of
our own and others that don't work as well any more. So debate the list.
How could you leave off...?? How could you include...?? But if you use
it to check out some films you've never seen, we'll be happy.

Note: First, every member created their own list of the 100 Best Films
of the 1960s. Then, all those ballots were combined into one master
list, ties were broken and only the Top 100 movies made the cut. Then
we each ranked those 100 films from 1 pt all the way up to our favorite
at 100 pts. Those totals were used to determine the  ranking of each
film in groups of 10, such as 91-100 at the top, 41-50 near the middle
down to 1-10 at the bottom. On the evening all members convened, we
then voted on each block of ten films, starting with the bottom 10 and
then working our way up to the Top 10. Naturally, in some cases the
order of films remained mostly the same. In others, it changed
dramatically. When two or more films in a group of ten received the
same number of points, we voted to break the tie. For example, in the
grouping of 71-80, "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" received the same
number of votes as "The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner."
Two more disparate films it would be hard to find, but the tie was
broken and "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" prevailed. On the list, the first
point total is the final number of pts it earned to achieve its final slot;
the second pt. total is what it achieved to make the master list.
