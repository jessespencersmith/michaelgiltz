* The Best Intentions. Ing­
mar Bergman "retired" after 
making Fanny and Alexander, de­
claring it his last movie as a direc­
tor. Well, sort of. Since then he's 
done work for TV and theater, pub­
lished his memoirs, and plumbed the relationship of his mother and 
father in a novel and screenplay, 
both titled The Best Intentions. As 
directed by Bille August, the 
movie's a clear-eyed but moving 
story of the courtship and early 
years of marriage between Henrik 
and Anna Bergman. From the 
shocking opener-in which Henrik 
coldly refuses to see his dying 
grandmother-to the tentative, 
ambiguous ending, there's not a 
trace of sentimentality or roman­
ticism in it. Obviously, Bergman's 
only intention was to tell his par­
ents' story truthfully. He served 
them well. Academy Elite, $89.95; 
subtitled. MICHAEL GILTZ 
discretion, Bergman-style.</p>
