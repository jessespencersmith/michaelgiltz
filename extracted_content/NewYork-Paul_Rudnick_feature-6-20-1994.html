PAUL RUDNICK ON THE GAYQUAKE 
The playwright-screenwriter-essayist. 
PAUL RUDNICK'S ESSAY FOR THIS ISSUE WAS 
due a week ago, his new show (The Naked 
Truth) opens this Thursday at the WPA 
Theatre, his 1993 play Ueffrey) begins 
filming in July, and he's gearing up for the 
Gay Games (his essay starts on page 34). 
But all that pales in comparison with Rud­
nick's real burden: moving. That meant 
vacating a fifth-floor-walk-up apartment 
once occupied by John Barrymore. Was he 
worried about a surprise visit from Nicol 
Williamson, who famously misbehaved in 
Rudnick's I Hate Hamlet (and is now in a 
one-man show about Barrymore)? "Oh, 
please," the New Jersey native says. "As if 
he could get up that many stairs." 
Rudnick can afford to joke. Besides the 
plays, he's written two novels (including 
1'1/ Take It) and several films (including 
Addams Family Values). He's been busy 
enough to avoid the inevitable Gay Games 
squabbles about "inclusiveness." 
"It's only in New York that you get into 
those insane Village Voice debates," Rud­
nick says. "[ was at an ACT UP meeting 
once, and this really earnest woman got 
up and said that what we really needed to 
do was raise funds to buy dental dams for 
the lesbians in EI Salvador." 
Though the parades and parties will keep 
him busy, Rudnick is looking forward to 
gay traffic. "All of New York's streets are 
going to be clogged with homosexuals," he 
says. "But we are just the politest minority. 
I'd always want to be the policeman who 
works a gay event, because nothing bad 
ever happens. They stand there, they get 
ogled, and that's it." -
