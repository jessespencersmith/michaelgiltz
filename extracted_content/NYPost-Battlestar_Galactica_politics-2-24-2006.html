damentalism andthewar on terror?
"24"?"TheWestWing"?
How about "Battlestar: Galac-
tica," the SCI FI hit airing Fridays
at 10 p.m. that's swiftly become
one of the most complex, dark
and political shows on TV
Creator Ron Moore - who
worked on shows like "Star
Tlek The Next Generation"
and "Roswell" - admits the sci-
ence-fiction setting is a blessing.
"You can get away with things
in the science-fiction universe
that contemporary drama can't
touch," says Moore.
"Wed be in endless arynments
over the content of the show if we
were actually dealing with Repub-
licans and Democrats and Chris-
tians and Jews and Muslims and
the war on terrorisn!" he says.
"But give it a sci-fi spin, and you
get a nice big pass."
On the show humans are bat-
tling Cylons, which can look just
like them but are not "really"
alive. The show depicts the sexu-
al abuse and torture of Cylons
("You can't rape a machine," one
human says blithely.) And the
entire story begins with a 9/Il-
style attack that wipes out virtu-
ally the entire human population.
"Battlestar Galactica" also mess-
es with viewer expectations. Mary
McDonnell plays President Roslin,the Secretary of Education who
became president after everyone
else in succession was wiped out
by the Cylons. She seemed a classic
liberal, but circumstances have
forged Roslin into a steely leader
convinced of her messianic destiny.
Recently, she outlawed abortion
(muchto her own dismay) because
humans are down to their last
54,000 people arrd need every baby.
Then there's the fascinating
rwist that the humans worship
multiple gods while the Cylons ar-e
monotheistic.
The result is a fanbase that cross-
es the political spectrurn And sci-
fi's traditionally liberal fans have
come nose-to-nose with "Galacti-
ca's" core fans ofthe original series,
who tended to be Republican
"I see more conservative fansites
and commentarythanl think is usu-
al for science fiction," says Moore,
a poliiical-science major in college
who likes to tweak both sides. "I
think the show is at its best when it
makes you vaguely uncomfortable
and makes you sort of wonder if
you're rooting for the wrong side."
Tricia Helfer - who plays Num-
ber Six, a beautiful Cylon - finds
herself fielding questions from fans
about monotheisrrl polytheisrrl the
influence ofBuddhism on the show
and other wildly complex issues.
"Sometimes on my Web site I
get asked questions I can't even
begin to answer," Iaughs Helfer.
"I've gone to conventions and
sometimes I worry I'm letting
them down."*</p>
