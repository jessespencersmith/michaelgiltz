borhood he's trapped ill. 
Across the street is a crack ad­
dict who can't be bothered to 
pay attention to her little daugh­
ter, Jadet. 
lad a tries to latch onto Loomis, 
hut he does everything he can to 
dissuade this desperate little girl 
from worming her way into his 
life. 
Just as persjsu~nt is the needy, 
tall«ltive Delores, a [,itCnu of

of harm's ay 
lady. in prison -more than his 
own family -and who holds 
out hope of becoming. more than 
friends. 
Morris has been nominated for 
a National Book Award for one 
novel, hnd another ingled uut 
by Time :IS une of the hest of the 
year ami e"en won the literary 
~quivalcllt 1'1' t],C 1 tery wbei, 
Oprah chost' "Songs in Ordinary 
rime" for \leI' book club 
Btl t it a 11 seems " li ttle too fa­
mili.ar. The characters are losers to a fault, with blunt details 
about their inner lives spelled 
out for anyone who can't figure 
out that little Jada is hungry for 
attention (and just plain hun­
gry), that Delores has a poor 
self-image and that Loomis isn't 
really cold or distant, just afraid 
of causing any more damage 
than he already has to the peo­
ple he cares for. 
The drug deaLers, the crack ad·· 
diet, the cranky neighbor who 
doesn't trust him .-it all feels 
rather obvious. One emotional breakthrough 
for Loomis feels earned; when 
he fmally says somethin g sin­
cere and simple in its honesty to 
Delores, you're relieved. 
Then Morris has to spoil it by 
letting him have a second emu­
tional breakthrough when speak­
ing to his brother Dennis. 
She should have learned the 
lessons Loomis did in prison: 
Take it slow, take it easy or 
you're liable to ruin whatever 
progress youtve achieved.</p>
