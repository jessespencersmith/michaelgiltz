the rest; Biloxi Blues is quite a beaut 
**** The Unbearable 
Lightness Of Being 
PlIlZIl 
Once in a great while, a movie 
comes along that makes you think, 
that challenges the way you view 
the world. But rarer still is a movie 
that thinks for itself, a movie that 
rushes along on a whirl of ideas, 
heedless of the audience it leaves 
breathless and far, far behind. The 
Unbearable Lightness Of 
Being is such a movie. 
The story concerns 
Tomas (Daniel Day 
Lewis), a philandering 
physician - a brain sur­
geon to be exact -who 
plays erotic mind games 
with the alluring Sabina 
(Lena Olin), a rising art­
ist. They have an enig-
matic relationship, appearing to be 
friends who make love rather than 
lovers who happen to be good 
friends, but it is a satisfying one. The two are happily ensconced in 
the burgeoning cultural life of 
Czechoslovakia in the 195Os, a time 
when the totalitarian goverl'.ment 
began to experiment with 
"socialism with a human face." 
Complications arise when Tomas 
flirts with a naive young woman in 
a small town -only to find her 
pop up on his doorstep a few days 
later. He takes the woman, named 
Tereza (juliette Binoche), into his 
home, though continu­
ing to dally with Sabina. 
Up to this point, the 
film is bracingly adult 
and almost brazenly 
self-reflective. The three 
of them lie together in 
various couplings, dis­
cussing their situation­
analyzing, criticizing 
and philosophizing in 
delightfully abstract terms. And 
then their world explodes . 
The liberalization of their 
country attracted the wrath of the Soviet Union, which invaded 
Czechoslovakia with tanks and 
troops. In a harrowing sequence, 
director Philip Kaufman mixes a 
montage of black and white scenes 
of the invaders with glimpses of 
our protagonists. Gripping shots of 
protesting Czechs seem to be ac­
tual newsreel footage, until we see 
Tomas or Tereza in the corner of 
the screen. 
The result is much more than a 
"you are there" immediacy, for 
Kaufman makes us painfully feel 
the loss of this country, this vibrant 
culture that will never be the same. 
When the scenes are over, we are 
drained and at a loss. What ever 
will Tomas and Tereza and Sabina 
do? Well, they leave. 
There is more, much more. We 
follow theD} as they go to Switzer­
land and observe the ensuing en­
tanglements. Then Sabina heads 
for America, while Tomas and 
Tereza go back to Czechoslovakia, ' 
though the land they left is gone 
-,-t</p>
<p>forever. 
Kaufman's vision is epic in scope, 
though only in the sense that any 
movie these days that is over two 
hours and doesn't end in a shootout 
is epic. He is abetted at every·step 
by the marvelous acting of the three 
leads and the wonderful 
screenplay (which Kaufman co­
adapted from Milan Kundera's ac­
claimed novel). One· can almost feel 
him relishing the slow, leisurely 
pa~ he has set for himself. 
That pace allows Kaufman to 
achieve what The Unbearable Light­
ness Of Being does best: show the 
careful sparring, the quiet jostling 
for advantage that occurs between 
adult human beings. 
Moment after indelible moment 
brings this home -the playful 
reunion between Tomas and Sabina 
after years of being apart, a reunion 
where they talk _ banally and he 
even makes a pretense for the door 
before they rush madly for the bed; 
I:he tragic time when Tereza tries to 
understand Tomas' constant indis­
cretions by sleeping with a 
stranger, an occurrence that is so 
sad and real that it is more painful 
than any rape or prostitution I have 
ever seen in the movies; the careful 
dance between a wary Tomas and 
an unconcerned city official who 
wants him to sign a public confes­
sion. 
There is more, much more, for 
Kaufman has followed the 
gloriously vibrant The Right Stuff 
with a thoughtful, daring piece. His 
ambition informs every frame and 
The Unbearable Lightness Of Being 
meanders from its highly charged 
beginning to a philosophical. 
musing end with a sure-footed, 
casual ease.

Neil Simon is to Broadway as 
Steven Speilberg is to the movies. 
Simon has been remarkably prolific 
over the years, with each season in­
variably bringing with it a new 
comedy along with one or two suc­
cessful holdovers. He is certainly 
the most successful playwright of 
our time. Also .like Speilberg, 
Simon has been a long time in get­
tinS critical recognition -perhaps correctly so. 
That is changing now. With a tril­
ogy of semi-autobiographical 
works (Brighton Beach Memoirs, 
Biloxi Blues and Broadway Bound), 
he has gained critical plaudits as 
well as some of the biggest com­
mercial success of his very com­
mercial career. 
But you wouldn't have known it 
from his movies. Simon has not 
been treated well as of late by the 
cinema, and even Brighton Betlch 
Memoirs, which had been heralded 
as the beginning of his mature 
masterpiece, came across as hokey 
and unsatisfying. 
Now that is changing as well. 
Mike Nichols, who has col­
laborated with Simon on four 
plays, has finally helmed one 
onscreen, and his thought~ atten­
tion to detail shows. With the 
added presence of Matthew 
Broderick, in the Simon-based role 
of Eugene that he originated on 
Broadway, Biloxi Blues sparkles. 
The film follows Eugene as he is 
drafted into the Army and endures 
boot camp in 1945. The usual es­
capades follow: Christopher 
Walken plays a low-key sergeant 
with a delightfully twisted sense of 
logic, and he rides hard over the 
usual assortment of soldiers, in­
cluding a tough-talking dummy, 
an Irishman and an all-American 
buddy. 
But it works. Simon's script is 
hilarious and filled with witty set 
pieces, especially the scene where 
Eugene loses his virginity to a pros­
titute. Biloxi Blues also benefits 
from the very original character of 
Epstein, a homosexual Jew that 
Eugene feels friendly toward but 
never really defends against the 
others' racial jibes. Epstein gives 
this otherwise Army regulation, 
standard-issue story a good 
amount of depth, and Corey Parker 
delivers a bristiing but poignant 
performance. 
Biloxi Blues is a study in modesty. 
It never achieves greatness because 
it never attempts to; the filmmakers 
set their goals carefully and 
achieved them. Its sturdy pleasures . 
- a witty script, a strong ensemble 
and sensitive direction -will carry 
this movie far into the future long 
after other, flashier films have be­
come outdated and worn.
