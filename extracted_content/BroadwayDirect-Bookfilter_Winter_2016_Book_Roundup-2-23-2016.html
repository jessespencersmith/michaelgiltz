MASTER OF CEREMONIES
By Joel Grey$27.99, Flatiron Books
Theater buffs always salivate when a legendary star like Joel Grey delivers a memoir. Great
shows, great stories, great dish . . . what will he reveal? But that natural interest is supersededwhen an artist digs deeper to reveal their heart. Here, Grey tells it all, from his early years as a
BOOKFILTER’S BEST OF THE WINTER PICKS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | FEBRUARY 23, 2016
SHARE</p>
<p>child star in vaudeville to glamorous nightclubs and finally Broadway and the movies. His fateful
casting in the legendary original Cabaret,  the film set battles with director Bob Fosse, private
struggles, and career cappers like Chicago  and Wicked  are present in vivid detail. But above
all, Grey charts his personal journey, as complicated and fluid a voyage as one would expect
from an artist of his quicksilver talent. Learn more.
BEATRICE AND BENEDICK
By Marina Fiorato$27.95, St. Martin’s Press
The plays of Shakespeare will be a source of inspiration forever — no surprise, since the Bard
himself drew upon history and myth and the works of others to shape his own dramas. Here,author Marina Fiorato gives us the backstory to Much Ado About Nothing . We know how it ends
(happily, for everyone not named Don John). But how did it begin? Building on clues in the text,Fiorato charts the first stormy romance between these two notable wits, future lovers who take asmuch pleasure in their battle of the minds as they do in their attraction to one another. The worldconspires to keep them apart, but of course we know that all’s well that ends well. The half-Venetian Fiorato takes pleasure in re-creating Renaissance Italy and leading us up to the
beginning of one of Shakespeare’s most memorable romances. Learn more.
KING CHARLES III
By Mike Bartlett$14.95, Theatre Communications Group
Some plays demand to be read. If you’re lucky enough to see Mike Bartlett’s “future history
play,” you’ll be besotted by the versifying in this tale of Prince Charles finally ascending to thethrone, with disastrous results. It’s (mostly) written in iambic pentameter, but that’s only the startof the fun. Bartlett skewers our gossip-obsessed culture, paints convincing backstage portraitsof the royals, and then turns this seemingly silly story into gripping political drama. It’s worthsavoring every word. And let’s hope Bartlett’s forays into television don’t keep him away from the
boards for too long. Learn more.
PAL JOEY</p>
<p>By John O’Hara, Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers, Thomas Mallon
$16, Penguin Classics
Has it been 75 years already? The heel Pal Joey was first introduced in the pages of The New
Yorker,  where author O’Hara had more published stories than any other writer, ever. That was
turned into a book and the book became a cynical stage smash hit musical by Rodgers & Hart,and that  became a movie starring Frank Sinatra, which would have been great if the tale’s cold,
cold heart hadn’t freaked out Columbia Pictures. This anniversary edition includes the originalcollection plus the libretto and lyrics for the stage musical, making it a master class in seeinghow to turn stories into a show, not to mention capturing characters in song. Now is it too late to
have Hugh Jackman star in the revival everyone wants to see? Learn more.
JACK & LOUISA ACT 2
By Andrew Keeenan-Bolger and Kate Wetherhead$16.99, Grosset & Dunlap
The actors and friends Andrew Keenan-Bolger and Kate Wetherhead have it all: thriving careers
as performers and the self-starting verve to launch a web series, their own varied projects, andthis middle-grade series about two theater-crazy kids. They each narrate a chapter in turn, withJack all nice-guy class and Louisa all sass. This time their school is doing Guys & Dolls andthey’re angling for plum parts until a hotshot director comes between them. A third book isalready set for 2017, so this series is just getting started. It’s no surprise they know their stuff:You can catch Wetherhead on stage right now in New York City in the comedy Clever Little Lies,
and Keenan-Bolger hits Broadway in March with the new musical Tuck Everlasting.  Learn more.
THE SECRET LIFE OF THE AMERICAN MUSICAL
By Jack Viertel$28, Sarah Crichton Books
The subtitle says it all: How Broadway Shows Are Built.  Author Jack Viertel is a key player — the
senior vice president, to be exact — of Broadway powerhouse the Jujamcyn Theaters, which
owns five Broadway houses, among other interests. He has decades of experience shepherdinghit shows to the spotlight, from the musical City of Angels  to the landmark Angels in America
and the rich body of work by August Wilson. Here, he focuses on the musical, structuring his
book like a show (complete with overture) to demonstrate step by step how a production is put</p>
<p>together, what works and what doesn’t, and how you fix it. Going backstage is one thing; going
inside the brain of a top theater impresario and getting his insight into the makings of a musical
is even rarer and even more of a treat. Learn more.
EXPERIMENTAL O’NEILL
By Eugene O’Neill$16, Rare Bird Books
If you ask us, playwright Eugene O’Neill was almost always  experimental. This anthology
focuses on key early works The Emperor Jones  (notably providing a great role for black actors
who sorely lacked them at the time), The Hairy Ape , and the one-acts set on board a ship,
known collectively as The S.S. Glencairn Plays.  It’s a useful look at one facet of a prolific career
best known for his lengthy tragedies. Learn more.
FULL MOON STAGES
By Judith Malina$18.95, Three Rooms Press
For some, a life in the theater means Broadway or, for those who have other lives but never lost
the bug, perhaps local community productions. But regional and experimental theater are oftentheir own hardscrabble, thrilling existence. And no one typified that better than Judith Malina,the pioneering cofounder of the radical, politically fiery troupe The Living Theater. Malina hasperformed all over the world and even went to jail for her convictions. But come hell or highwater, on every full moon she wrote a new entry in the diary of her life. This memoir collectsthose frank and funny observations, creating a biography of her career and a record of the
movement she helped steer for decades. Learn more.
BUT THE GIRAFFE AND BRUNDIBAR
By Tony Kushner & Maurice Sendak$15, Theatre Communications Group
Tony Kushner’s collaboration with the late illustrator/artist Maurice Sendak was unique and
celebrated, as one would expect of such a duo. The picture book Brundibar  celebrates the</p>
<p>Czech opera about children facing down tyranny, for which Kushner wrote a new English-
language libretto and Sendak did the design. But the Giraffe  is a play Kushner wrote to give the
historical context for Brundibar,  an opera first performed in death camps during World War II. A
sensitive introduction to a painful topic and a celebration of two giants, this paperback reissue
collects both pieces in one package. Learn more.
TROUPERS OF THE GOLD COAST
By Constance Mayfield Rourke$16.99, Skyhorse Publishing
Here’s a gem of a story about a little-known corner of theater history. It was California that
spawned the company Troupers of the Gold Coast in 1837. They lasted almost 170 years (!),giving their final performance as a company in 2005. This look at the troupe first came out in1928. It tells their story while naturally focusing on the meteoric rise of its biggest star: LottaCrabtree, the acting, singing, dancing, banjo-playing talent known as “The Nation’s Darling.”Mitzi Gaynor starred in a Hollywood version of her life called Golden Girl, but you can get acloser, better look here, from the early encouragement of Lola Montez to a mother who actuallyprotected her child (no Mamma Rose here!) — and a retirement at 45, both wealthy and
content. Hey, it happens. Learn more.
THE NIGHT ALIVE & OTHER PLAYS
By Conor McPherson$18.95, Theatre Communications Group
Few playwrights have been as consistently lauded and commercially successful in the past 20
years as Irishman Conor McPherson. This anthology collects his three most recent dramas. “TheNight Alive” is a seemingly conventional tale about several men getting by in Dublin when aprostitute comes crashing into their lives. But the sense of the off-kilter is never far when dealingwith McPherson, who made his name worldwide with the ghost story “The Weir.” That ominousundertone is more overt in “The Veil” (a story set in a haunted house) and “The Birds,” a stageadaptation of the original short story by Daphne du Maurier that inspired Hitchcock’s movie ofthe same name. Consider this a good chance for catching up on where this talented writer is at
today. Learn more.</p>
<p>TUCK EVERLASTING
By Natalie Babbitt$19.99, Farrar Straus and Giroux
A new musical based on this modern classic hits Broadway in March. What better way to
prepare than to dive into the original? First published in 1975, it tells the story of a little girlnamed Winnie who develops a crush on a 17-year-old boy who is kind to her. His family is . . .unusual. She eventually discovers they are immortal, thanks to a mysterious, hidden spring.Does Winnie want to share in their secret? Hide it from the world? Profit from it by doing thebidding of the Man in the Yellow Suit who is stalking them? Or eventually turn her back on thelure of living forever in exchange for the joys and sorrows of a real life? Twice turned into amovie (the more recent, better version stars Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls ), it’s a seemingly
simple story with dark undercurrents and the ideal introduction to the work of Babbitt. You’ll sing
its praises even before you see the musical. Learn more.
THE JAVIER PLAYS
By Carlos Murillo$18, 53  State Press
This anthology collects a trilogy of dramas dubbed “The Javier Plays” by Chicago fixture CarlosMurillo. “Diagram of a Paper Airplane,” “A Thick Description of Harry Smith (Volume 1),” and“Your Name Will Follow You Home” are all here. But they’re just the tip of the iceberg for Murillo,the head of playwriting at the Theatre School of DePaul University and the recipient of the DorisDuke Impact Award last year for his work in the theater. No one can see every show in NewYork City, much less all over the country. So thank goodness for books that can chart theaterhistory, tell the story of the greats, and collect the plays of artists for us to read wherever they
thrive. Learn more.
