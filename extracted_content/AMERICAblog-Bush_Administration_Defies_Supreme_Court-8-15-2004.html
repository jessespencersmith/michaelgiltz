8/15/2004 03:39:00 PMBush continues to show his disdain for the rule of law -- he's above it,don't you remember? On Friday, USA Today reported that the Bushadministration is arguing against all logic that the Supreme Courtruling that said the detainees in Cuba have a right to contest theirdetentions don't really have any rights at all. Bush is insisting thoseprisoners have "no legal rights," especially the right to counsel.Attorney for the detainees wrote, "One would never know that thiscase had just been to the Supreme Court of the United States, wherethe government made -- and lost -- virtually the same arguments itnow recycles here."Yes, Bush is refusing to abide by a ruling of the Supreme Court. Thisshould be a much bigger issue, since Bush has a pattern of ignoringthe law of the land. A U.S. District Judge in DC plans to heararguments on Monday.
