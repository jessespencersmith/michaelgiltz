7/12/2005 07:36:00 PMHere's how NOT to cover a brewing scandal in the White House.We've linked below to numerous articles from major mediaoutlets who've framed this serious issue fairly and with theproper weight. Heck, even Fox News asked some toughquestions at yesterday's press conference.So with all that to draw on, how does the LA Times cover thisbreach of national security? Very poorly. It uses this headline:DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT ROVE IN LEAK CASE(See, it's those mean old Dems playing politics.)And this is some of the copy:The ongoing controversy about who might have leaked thename of a covert CIA operative to journalists heated upMonday as reports about the possible involvement ofPresident's Bush's chief political strategist, Karl Rove,dominated the daily White House news briefing andDemocrats began to ratchet up their criticism of Rove....Still, the new information about Rove's role was emergingas a potential embarrassment for a White House thathad scrupulously sought to avoid the kinds of investigationsthat plagued the Clinton administration....It has also given Democrats a political issue....The sharpest criticisms came from some of the mostpartisan Democrats in Congress....The only Republican to issue a statement on the matterMonday was Ken Mehlman, chairman of the RepublicanNational Committee. "It's disappointing that once again, somany Democrat leaders are taking their political cues fromthe far-left, MoveOn wing of the party," he said, referring tothe online advocacy group MoveOn.org. "The bottom line isthe Democrats are engaged in blatant partisan politicalattacks...."Really, leaking national security secrets at a time of war is a"potential embarrassment" rather than a crime that could bepunishable by jail? And it's really just an excuse by the Dems to gangup on Bush? Well, if Ken Mehlman said it and every other Republicanis too afraid to say anything (and off the record they've been quotedby other newspapers that this is very serious indeed), why I guess itmust be true. Nothing to see here, keep moving.Let the LA Times know what you think of their coverage. Ask themwhy every other media outlet seems to think breaking nationalsecurity is a serious matter, not just an excuse for politics.Email them at letters@latimes.com
