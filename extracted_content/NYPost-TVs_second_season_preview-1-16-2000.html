Is midseason shows 
used to be called 
"replacements" -the 
second string backups 
for whatever new series 
failed to click. 
You didn't like that new 
cop drama? Well, here's 
another new cop drama we 
didn't think was half as good. 
No more. 
Nowadays, it seems like 
the networks are saving the 
best for last. 
That's why Fox announced 
"Malcolm in the Middle" 
during the fall preview sea­
son but waited to launch it 
in January. Its reward? crit­
ical raves and the biggest 
premiere numbers for that 
network since "The 
SimP80ns" in 1990. 
If"Malcolm" stays on a roll 
(and Fox doesn't cut the legs 
out from under it the way 
they did "King of the Hill"), 
it will join a long list of mid­
season superstars : 
"Seinfeld," "Third Rock 
From the Sun," "The 
Practice." and even "All 
the Family" all 
debuted during 
the winter. 
"Malcolm 
will be joined 
in the next few 
months by 
more than a 
dozen comedies 
and dramas and a 
whole lot of indeci­
sion. Why? First, a lot 
more of the faIl crop has 
survived than any of the 
networks expected . (CBS 
probably already had a 
replacement for "Family 
Law" all picked out until 
that show turned into a 
hit.) 
Second, the game 
shows meant to 
smother "Who 
Wants to be a 
Millionaire" are 
doing gangbusters. 
"Greed" is a mod-
est, less-embarrassing 
timeslot filler for Fox than 
those police chase videos; 
and "Twenty One" looks like 
a certifiable hit for NBC. 
Watch for "What"s My 
Line," "The 64,000 
Question" and Britain's 
"Mastermind" come sum­
mer. 
But every hit game show 
means one less slot for orig­
inal programming . That's 
why for most of the shows 
waiting in the wings. a firm 
time slot or air date is still a 
work-in-progress . 
Hopefully , the shows cov-NEW YORK POST. SUNDAY. JANUARY 16. 2000

God is voiced by James 
Garner, with French 
Stewart of "Third Rock" as 
the hapless Bob. 
Secret weapon: Nancy 
Cartwright (the voice of 
Bart Simpson) switches 
gender to voice Bub's rebel­
lious daughter. 
"Clerks" (ABC) is based 
on the profanity-laced indie 
nick by Kevin Smith. But 
turning the story of four 
guys in the dead-end world 
of convenience stores and 
New Jersey isn't as odd as it . 
sounds. 
Smith has already penned' 
a line of comic books based 
on the movie; he also set his 
critical hit, "Cha:;ing Amy: in 
the world of graphic novels. 
Look for less cu .. "ing and

you might want to watch

the relatively gentle comic

with a caustic, albeit warm­
hearted look.

tainly not for the little ones, .

Shoot Me" the creative force ' 
behind this autobiographi- . 
cal series. In it. he

lamented "NcwsRadio. " 
MORE LAW 
ANO DISORDER 
"Battery Park" (NBC) is 
the latest half hour comedy 
. from Gary David Goldberg, 
the producer behind "Spin 
City," "Family Ties," and 
"Brooklyn Bridge." It's 
pitched as a distaff "Barney 
Miller." with Elizabeth 
Perkins as the captain of 
detective s working in New 
York City, 
"Falcone" (CBS) has had 
more troubles than a crimi· 
nal featured on "America"s 
Most Wanted." First, the 
relatively violent drama -
based on the film "Donnie 
BraS(."Q" -was pulled from 
the fall schedulc. (Yct anot.h­
er tragic school shooting 
gave thc nctwork cold feet.) 
Now scheduled for mid­
season, this atory about 
undercover agents infiltrat­
ing thc mob has watchcd 
"'Thc Sopranos' get Ix,tter 
rc,\"ip\\'s t han -TIlt' Godfather ." 
CBS obviously wonts to 
give "Falcone" as much 
space between it and Tony 
Soprano as possible. 
Unfortunately, that may 
mean delaying it for the 
next five years. 
"TIte Beat" (UPN) has 
the best pedigree of any 
show on UPN, thc network 
that has "We Love Stone 
Cold Steve Austin" tattooed 
on its Nielsen rating 
reports. 
Another cop show (set in 
Ncw York, naturally), it

("Homicide;" ·01,"). 
Stylish and ofTbcat, it has 
the schizophrenic quality of 
CBS"s "Now nnd Again"­
switching gears from 
"Miami Vice" glitter to 
"Cops"-likc realism with 
nary a second thought, 
MORE HOSPITALS 
"Wonderland" (ABC) is 
about the cases dealt with 
in a psychiatric hospital (set 
in New York City, natural­
ly). Shot like a documentary , 
it's written, directed and 
produced by Pewr Berg of 
"Chicago Hope." 
"City of Angel .... (CBS) 
has its debut tonight. Like 
cvery TV show or movie 
with a predomin antly black 
cast, this innercity hospital 
drama is being unfairly 
positioned as yet another 
. make-or-break test. 
. If it suc<;reds (like "The 
Cosby Sho,y" or "Waiting to 
Emal,,") the show will be 
seen 'as an exception . If ~t 
fails (like "Belo,'ed" or any 
.' number of dramas) it will be 
seen as proof positive that 
"black" shows don't work.

MORE SEXY 
YOUNG PEOPLE 
1\\'0 of the better shows 
from thc fall season wcre 
part of the teen flood: the 
terrific "Freaks and Gccks' 
on NBC and "Popular" (0 
slow-building performer for 
WB). Most of the others 
quickly failed, but more 
keep coming. 
"Brutally Normal" (WB) 
is a single-camera .(reod: 
ambitious) sitcom about 
three boys coming of age. No 
period piece (like "Freaks," . 
which is set in thc "SO.) and 
no earnestness (like 
"Dawson"s Creek"). 
So what's the hook? 
Fantasy sequences a la "Ally 
McBeal." And if they're any­
thing like the fantasies of 
most teenage boys, maybe 
this should have bcen on 
cable. 
"MYOB" (NBC) stars a 
strect-savvy runaway 
(Katherine Townc) who 
moves in with her lonely­
hearts aunt living in a small 
town. Cultures clash. 
Think of J('I1'S cantankcr­
ous relationship with her 
grandmother on "Dawson"" 
Creek" but with less angst 
and more punchlines . 
MORE ODDS 
AND ENDS 
"Grapevi ne" (CBS) had a 
summer run in '92, bufthat 
won't stop people from 
labelling it a ·Sex and the 
City" for Miami. 
Originally a . "UJve, 
Amcri('an Stylc ~ omnibus 
about lovers .. who cross 
paths with our heros, it may 
now focus more on tho cen­
tral C(l'1. 
That c,,,1 includes Kristy 
Swansun. who knows some­
thing ahout sccond chance", 
hcr movie "BufTy the 
Vampire Slnyer" was a flop, 
but liS a series (starring 
Sarah Michelle Gellar) it's 
become one of the bcst 
shows on tcle,;sion . 
"The Others" (NBC) 
was probably in develop­
ment lung before "The 
Sixth SCllse" clicked at the 
box office. But that won't 
stop this drama. about a 
mysterious group of. psy­
chics exploring the. para­
normal from hoping view­
erg want more creepy fun. 
"I Dare You" (UPN)' 
showcases daredevil 
stunts, with Evel Kneivel 
Jr. as host. Hey, just 
because Fox swore off 
crashing jumbo jets in the 
desert doesn't mean every­
one else has to as well. 
"Titus" (Fox) has what 
seems like the most origi­
nal idea nf midseason. It's a 
sitcom -starrillg 0'1 adult 
-and based on the routine 
. of a stand-up comic! . 
Since "Titus' isn't one of 
20 sitcoms doing the very 
same thing, that actually 
seems a little fresh. 
Based on the jokes of 
Christopher Titus, it costnr"
