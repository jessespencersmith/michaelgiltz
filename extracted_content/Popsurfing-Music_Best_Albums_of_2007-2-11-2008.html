            <p>M O N D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 1 ,  2 0 0 8Best CDs of 2007A best CDs of the year list in February? Why not? (Calendars are so20th century.) My end of the year is always hectic. Freelance journalistsare deluged with work around the holidays because staffers want tospend time with their families. Add in time with my own family andfriends, a deluge of movies (my best movies of 2007 list is here) andsuddenly that pile of CDs gets shoved aside until January.So the Grammy Awards serve as my own personal deadline forcompiling a list of the Best CDs of the year. You'll find a list, followedby commentary describing the artists and what I love about theiralbums. Record stores may be closing left and right but anyone whosays there's no excitement in music just isn't listening. Soul, pop, rock,jazz, Broadway, Americana, rap, world music, country, film scores --there's a lot to love. Enjoy!NOTE: For the vast majority of these acts, if you want to hear what theysound like Google their name and "MySpace" and you'll get a link totheir MySpace page where typically three or four songs from theircurrent album will be available for play.THE BEST CDS OF 20071.
