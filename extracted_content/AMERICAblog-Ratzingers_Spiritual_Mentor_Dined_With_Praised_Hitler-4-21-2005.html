4/21/2005 02:54:00 AMYes, more information from the well-travelled territory of PopeBenedict XVI/Ratzinger's childhood during the war. This time,the Independent UK goes to his hometown and quotes anumber of people quite hard on the teenage Ratzinger.Yet, in Traunstein, some of the town's older residentsfeel that questions about the Pope's early yearsremain unanswered. Herta Kaiser, an 83-year-oldpensioner recalled that several people in the town hidJews from the Nazis and helped them to escape toneutral Switzerland. "Traunstein was not all Nazi, itwas also a Catholic stronghold," she said.There is no evidence that the Ratzinger family feltinclined to help the town's few remaining Jews, or thesmattering of anti-Nazi resistance fighters who daredto oppose the regime.Elizabeth Lohner, 84, whose brother-in-law was sentto Dachau concentration camp for being aconscientious objector, recalled: "It was possible toresist and those people set an example for others."She added: "The Ratzingers were young and madedifferent choices."In 1937, another Traunstein family hid a localanti-Nazi resistance fighter, named Hans Braxenthaler.He had been tortured in Dachau for his opposition tothe regime. Frieda Meyer, 82, one of the Ratzingerfamily's neighbours at the time, said: "WhenBraxenthaler was betrayed and the Nazis came forhim, he shot himself rather than give himself up."And here's info I haven't read before about Ratzinger's mentor:Ratzinger's election will also raise questions about thedubious role played by the Catholic Church during theNazi era. The extent to which leading Catholics feltobliged to reach compromises with the regime isoutlined by the stance taken by Ratzinger's mentor,Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, one of the Pope'smost important early influences.Documented evidence shows that the cardinal visitedHitler's mountain retreat during the 1930s and wasentertained to lunch by the Führer in person. Duringtheir meeting, Von Faulhaber is on record as tellingHitler that the Church saw him as an "authoritychosen by God, to whom we owe respect".Some mentor. As fallible human beings, I'm sure we can allempathize with the desire to not be harmed. Heck, this is howNaziism and the Holocaust flourished: the price of resisting
