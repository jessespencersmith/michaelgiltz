10/19/2004 05:49:00 PMWith your emails and boycotts focusing laser attention on them,Sinclar has started to buckle under the pressure.According to USA Today, they now say they don't plan -- heck, theyNEVER planned -- to air that 42 minute diatribe against Kerry knownas "Stolen Honor." That, of course, is a lie. Now they plan to useexcerpts of it in a "news feature" about the issue. It's still set to airon Friday.Its stock fell another 32 cents to $6.26 Tuesday, down 12% sincetheir political rally for Bush was first reported. The company is miredin debt, so any desire to go private would be difficult. They're beingsued for skirting duo-poly laws by having minority holding firms ownsecond TV stations in a a number of cities.And in a lovely bit of wording, a Lehman Bros. analyst says airing thedocumentary has "no upside and only multi-dimensional downside"for the company.Keep up the pressure to make sure anything they do air is, as Foxwould say, fair and balanced.
