With The Dark Knight  shredding one box office
record after another and even casual fans talking
about second weekend box office drops ("Hey,60% for a front-loaded spectacle like Iron Man  is
not bad!"), it's easy to forget that some moviescan still slip under the radar, pile up money andturn into box office hits when no one is looking.Usually, word of mouth follows a good movie andgets them touted as success stories. What I'mtalking about here are the movies that weren't
championed by critics and yet somehow pulled in a bigger chunk of change than anyoneremembers. You see what they grossed and say, "Really? How did that happen?"
Take 21, the card counting casino caper based on the true story of MIT students who figured out a
way to win at blackjack. (It's not cheating as such, but casinos hate it when you can game the
system to your advantage and fight it aggressively.) 21  ($28.96 for standard or $34.95 for a special
edition and $38.96 for BluRay; Columbia) features a young good-looking cast of kids and KevinSpacey and Laurence Fishburne in key supporting roles. The movie got mixed reviews, the pokercraze has faded a bit since gambling online became illegal and the movie opened togeneral...disinterest. But somehow it opened to $24 million and had enough legs to triple that takeand gross $81 million in the US.
How did that happen? But look back over the charts of the past few years and you can find a
number of movies that seemed to do a lot better than you would guess. Did that dumb comedy
Wild Hogs starring John Travolta and the perenially underestimated Tim Allen REALLY gross
$168 million? Apparently. (All figures are US grosses alone.) Did The Rock and a little girl really
hit $89 million with The Game Plan? Yep, and that's not nearly as shocking as Vin Diesel playing ananny in  The Pacifier and raking in $113 million.
I can never remember who starred in the anonymously named Failure To Launch  (It was Matthew

Her husband Matthew Broderick pulled in $97 million as Inspector Gadget  though it sure seemed
like a flop at the time. That talking animal trailer somehow raised Kangaroo Jack  to $66 million
and I doubt even the people who made it are anything but shocked. And sometimes a movie can bereviled for destroying a beloved classic, SEEM like a terrible flop and yet be the top-grossing movie
of the year at $260 million: that would be How The Grinch Stole Christmas (and it wasn't Jim
Carrey's fault). So if you think you know how successful or not a movie was, think again. They
might just surprise you.
Is there any movie that leaves you gobsmacked at how much money it actually made?
Also out this week: two more exceptional Criterion releases, the Kurosawa drama High and Low
and the wonderfully packaged and creepy Vampyr  ($39.95 each; Criterion); if you're suddenly a
fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal after The Dark Knight, check out her naughty turn in the nicely perverseSecretary  ($14.98; Lionsgate); Robert Smigel's aggressively bawdy sketch show Comedy Central's
TV Funhouse  ($26.98; Paramount); Without The King  ($24.95; First Run), an entertaining
documentary about the last king of Swaziland that proves just about anyone will let camera crewsinto their lives - even clueless monarchs; Tom Selleck's in full control of Las Vegas Season Five
($59.98; Universal), though Josh Duhamel is still taller; NFLer Chad Johnson hosts In Just One
Play: The Big-Play Men of the NFL  ($19.98; Warner Bros.) though instead of 90 minutes of clips
I'd rather watch them all be drug-tested; Andre Techine 4-Film Collector's Edition  ($34.98;
LionsGate) a bargain especially if you don't already own his acclaimed Wild Reeds  from 1994; Twin
Daggers ($26.98; LionsGate), a so-so chop-socky movie; Heavy Metal In Baghdad ($19.95; Arts
Alliance), an engrossing documentary about Iraqis who just wanna rock; director Jean-Pierre
Melville's last noir, Dirty Money  ($19.98; LionsGate) starring the impossibly beautiful duo of Alain
Delon and Catherine Deneuve; the festival hit labor of love comedy Big Dreams Little Tokyo($14.99; Echo Bridge), which was written and directed and stars Dave Boyle; the umpteenth spinon Spinal Tap,  this one -- Brutal Massacre  ($26.97; Anchor Bay) -- about a horror director
tackling his magnum opus; mixed martial arts conquers the UK in Cage Rage Superstar Collection($14.98; Mill Creek) which gets huge props for including almost 60 fights amidst 13 hours offootage for a super-low price; and finally if you are tired of waiting for an IMAX screening of The
Dark Knight that isn't sold out, check out the Blu-Ray edition of the campy 60s version Batman
The Movie  ($39.98; Fox). POW! BLAM! BOP! At least you'll have some fun.
