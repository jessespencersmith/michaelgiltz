Student 
will die 
on a 
shocker 
'Degrassi' 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
TV's most controversial 
teen show goes Colum­
bine tonight with a 
two-part episode on 
school shootings. 
"Degrassi: The Next 
Generation" (8 p.m. on 
The N) ends a story spiral 
that's been developing for 
two seasons when Rick, a 
student with a violent tem­
per, is bullied and humili­
ated once too often and 
comes back to school with 
a gun. 
One student dies, an­
other is seriously injured 
and "Degrassi" rocks the 
world of its still-growing, 
devoted young audience. 
Executive producer and 
head writer Aaron Martin 
has been pushing to tackle 
this subject since the new 
"Degrassi" debuted four 
seasons ago. (It's the se­
quel to the '80s "Degrassi 
Junior High," which 
broke ground for "Bev­
erly Hills, 90210" and. 
other teen dramas that fol­
lowed.) 
"It wasn't an issue when 
the original 'Degrassi' was 
on, and it's become much 
more of an issue in the last 
10 years," says Martin, 33. 
"And with any teen shows, 
there are only so many is­
sues you can cover, and 
new ones are harder and 
harder to find." 
It's the latest hot-button The bullying is just too much for one 
student at Degrassi High tonight, 
setting off a murderous shooting spree. 
Sean (played by Daniel Clark) is among 
those who must face the music. 
topic given the thoughtful 
"Degrassi" treatment. 
Earlier this year, the N's 
decision not to air an epi­
sode dealing with abortion 
made headlines, especially 
since the series has 
quickly become the signa­
ture show for the Nand 
remains a prime time fix­
ture in its native Canada. 
Other topics it's tackled 
include alcoholic parents, 
abusive relationships and 
gay teens coming out. 
But it's not all misery at "Degrassi"; one memora­
ble, recent plot had a kid 
using a penis pump be­
cause he felt inadequate 
around the older boys in 
the locker room. 
For Aubrey Graham, who 
plays Jimmy, being at the 
heart of the shooting epi­
sode is a welcome challenge. 
"I'm usually involved in 
the jock love triangle," 
says Graham, "which is al­
ways fun because the girls 
on the show are amazing." 
In Canada, where the ep-isodes already aired and 
scored the highest ratings 
in the show's history, fans 
have been traumatized. 
"I'll be at the mall," says 
the 18-year-old Graham, 
"and people say, 'Oh my 
God, are you okay? What's 
going to happen? Are you 
going to die?'" 
Those might be easier to 
answer than the questions 
Graham could be getting 
soon. Up soon for "De­
grassi?" A two-parter on
