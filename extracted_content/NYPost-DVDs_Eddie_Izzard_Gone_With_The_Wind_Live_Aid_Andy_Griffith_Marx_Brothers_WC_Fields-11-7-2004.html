Gone With The Wind ***'/2 Warner Bros., $39.92 
This epic romance is a 
cinematic gem, albeit with 
flaws at its center -foolish 
racism (offset by brilliant black 
actors) and the wistful longing 
for a South that never existed. 
But what a cast! And this new 
remastering is gorgeous. 
Two discs bursting with extras, 
including a brand new 
docume-ntary narrated by 
Christopher Plummer, make 
certain that fans starving for 
new information will never go 
hungry again. 
Live Aid **'/2 
WSM,$ ~3_9._99~ ________ _ 
With 10 hours of music from 
the 1985 Live Aid concerts in 
Philadelphia and London, this 
four-disc set has plenty to 
chose from. There's the'bad 
(off-key Beach Boys; a 
rambling Dylan), the good (a 
smashing set by Q!teen), and 
the surprising (Bowie started 
his set with "TVC 15" -cool). 
The Andy Griffith 
Show First Season ***'/2 Paramount. $38.99 
A quiet delight, this homespun 
sitcom is like nothing on TV 
today and we're the poorer for Eddie Izzard: 
Glorious ***'/2 WEA,$19.99 
We can argue for years 
about who is the 
funniest comic today. 
But the smartest? 
Hands down, it's Great 
Britain's cross­
dressing, heterosexual 
Eddie Izzard, who 
skewers religion, 
philosophy and history 
with a brilliant. 
stream-of­
consciousness style 
that appears casual but 
is honed to perfection . 
This concert is from 
1997 and also just out 
are concerts from '94 
and '96, letting you see 
the development of a 
genius. Glorious 
indeed. 
it. No extras, 'cause Sheriff 
Andy Taylor ain't a fancy kind 
of guy and wouldn't want us to 
make a fuss. Also just out: the 
hilarious "Kids in the Hall 
Season 2" ( A&E, $59.95) and 
"Buffy Season Seven" ($59.98, 
Fox), the last gasp of a once­
great show. 
Marx: Brothers 
Collection/W.C. Fields 
COllection **** each Universal, $59.98 each 
Two of cinema's defining 
verbal comics get their due. 
The Marx Brothers offer up 
five legendary comedies, 
including 1930's ')\nimal 
Crackers" and the never­
topped "Duck Soup," from 1933. 
Fields shows his acerbic but 
down-trodden everyman 
grumbling through five 
delights like 1934's "It's A Gift" 
and 1940's "The Bimk Dick." 
The extras on both sets are 
paltry, but the prints are eye­
poppingly good and you'll be 
laughing too much to care.</p>
