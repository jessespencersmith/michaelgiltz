Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayChris Evans is the author of the Iron Elves trilogy but his work is new to me. In this original work, he sets a VietnamWar-like quagmire in the fantastical setting of another world to give a new sense of urgency and moral complexity tothe sci-fi/fantasy war novel. The effect is quite striking. He begins with a raw recruit who slowly gets addicted to adrug to keep away the horrors of their situation fighting for the Kingdom against the "slyts," the slang term for theiressentially faceless and nameless enemy. Even the Kingdom is sort of a joke, since it turns out the King isn't reallythe King but in fact a bastard. So who are they fighting for? And what are they fighting for? The religion thatdominates their people is cold comfort to most of the soldiers, who curse whenever the Holy Book of their faith ismentioned by newcomers. Instead of napalm and helicopters, this war has dragons and their fire (the twists Evansputs on dragons are especially vivid and clever). Another twist: dwarves are ever-present but despised by many.They were slaves until a few decades earlier but prejudice runs high; tensions always run high, they aren't allowed tobear arms (much like many black soldiers in WW II who were often consigned to dangerous or menial tasks), and ifthey're wounded dwarves are given inferior medical care. Evans keeps raising the stakes as he introduces more andmore characters -- a clueless commander, a dragon rider, doctors, a government agent involved in intrigue and thewizard-like soldiers who plumb what seems like sorcery to strike out against their enemy. The goal of the soldiers wefollow is to lure the lurking enemy into striking against their stronghold in a valley called Bone and Thunder so thatthe enemy -- once seen -- can be destroyed. It works all too well. The more harried and hopeless their task becomes,the more this book achieves its goal of breathing new life into the genre of fantastical war books. No good versus evilhere, just layers and layers of grey. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say"A masterful debut -- if J.R.R. Tolkien and Bernard Cornwell had a literary love child, this would be it." - KarenTraviss, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Star Wars: Legacy of the Force-Revelation and City ofPearl"Fascinating...combining the best touches of fantasy and military storytelling." - John Ringo, New York Timesbestselling author of the Legacy of the Aldenata and The Council Wars series"A thrilling epic from beginning to end, filled with wit, intrigue, and twists and turns reminiscent of Glen Cook's TheBlack Company.

Knaak, New York Timesbestselling author in the Dragonlance, The Dragonrealm, World of Warcraft, and Diablo series"A fantasy in which the gritty realities of war and politics are as important as the magic -- and all are handled verywell."  - David Drake, national bestselling author of the Lord of the Isles and Hammer's Slammers series"Imagine Napoleon's armies invading Middle Earth, mixing gunpowder with magic, monsters, and heroes.
