            <p>Kubrick's  2001:  A  Space  Odyssey
Wows  in  Concert
THE  ART  OF  THE  SCORE  --  2001:  A  SPACE  ODYSSEY
WITH  THE  NEW  YORK  PHILHARMONIC,  ALAN  GILBERT  CONDUCTING
AVERY  FISHER  HALL
I imagine it's been a long time since the New York Philharmonic played with so much
chatter going on in the audience. But the screening of 2001:  A  Space  Odyssey  was more
like a pops concert than their usual fare. And when the closing credits of a movie arerolling, people tend to murmur, even if conductor Alan Gilbert is leading his musiciansthrough a lovely rendition of "On The Beautiful Blue Danube." It was all in the spirit ofthe evening, which began with thunderous roars of pleasure after "Also sprachZarathustra" near the beginning and concluded with applause for various names in thecredits like Douglas Trumbull and Arthur C. Clarke.
During an all too brief week devoted to the art of the film score, Lincoln Center also
featured an evening of selections of music from Hitchcock films (I'd kill to see Vertigoperformed live in full) and a panel discussion led by artistic adviser Alec Baldwin onmovie music.
But for me the highlight was the opportunity to see a flawless screening of Stanley
Kubrick's landmark work of imagination with the New York Philharmonic and a chorusdelivering classical selections from Ligeti, the Strauss's Richard and Johann II, amongothers in what is surely one of the most brilliant marriages between existing music andmovie images in history.
Every viewing brings fresh insights, from the usual (the hand-made special effects are still
brilliant and convincing; surely we've taken a disastrous turn for the worse with digitaleffects?) to the less typical (hey, Kubrick even imagined personal screens on airplanesembedded in the seat in front of you!). The sheer boldness of the story takes your breathaway. Who else could devote so much screen time to showing that monumental moment
when our distant ancestors first used tools? Who else would find the absolute perfect
music for such a thunderous, epoch-shaking moment? And who else would then flashforward with one of the most brilliant and evocative cuts ever imagined? And then to hintat our NEXT stage of evolution and somehow make us feel we truly are witnessing such amiraculous thing? It's set in 2001, but Kubrick will always be pointing the way to thefuture.

<p>You can enjoy this experience anytime you see the film (ideally in a theater with
immersive sound) so I should focus on this particular experience of seeing it with a world
class orchestra. It wasn't just enjoyable as any great film would be under such
circumstances. It was, in its way, a unique and revealing experience.
First, the mere presence of the orchestra throughout the screening humanized the film in
a very real and useful manner. If there is any difficulty in tackling this movie for
newcomers, it's a certain chilliness they imagine present in 2001 . That's ameliorated
greatly by the living, breathing mass of people on stage who are performing some of the
most indelible music ever heard. And that pairing of classical pieces with the movie isn't
just handy -- it's also a constant quiet reminder of humanity and the great artistic
flowering that humankind has produced, the enduring beauty that is our legacy. You can't
think of just empty space and wayward computers when people who have devoted theirlives to mastering this music are sitting right in front of you playing Khachaturian'sAdagio from Gayane .
I didn't even notice the chorus at first. They were seated on both sides of the first balcony.When voices were called for, they arose silently in the dark and the tiny flashlightshovering over their scores looked like alien creatures in the dark, adding even more to thealready spooky effect of the Kyrie from Ligeti's Requiem . Again, with the voices on both
sides of the stage often battling back and forth for supremacy, it added a dynamic,emotional element to a movie often wrongly seen as merely an intellectual head trip. Bestof all, I appreciated anew the use of silence in the film; nothing emphasized that morethan the presence of a full orchestra on stage waiting for its next cue. And it was a subtlegoosing of the excitement to see them settling into position, knowing you were about tohear more music.
I look forward to another edition of The Art Of The Score next year, including more
selections of great music composed for the movies as well as great movies like 2001  that
pulled from the classical repertoire. (Terence Malick, anyone, perhaps with a Bugs Bunnyshort to kick things off? Heck, they could do an entire evening devoted to classic music incartoons. If Baldwin isn't available, call me.) I could have done without the unnecessaryintermission that merely lengthened the night. But overall it was an excellent evening.Nothing captured the spirit more than the orchestra members onstage during the manylengthy passages without music. There they were, their instruments at rest, quietly leaningback in the dark and craning their necks to see every moment they could of the movieuntil it was time to go back to work.
