Makes babies cry on 'AMC' milestone 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
CAROL Burnett would go to 
the ends of the earth for" All 
My Children," her favorite 
soap pretty much since the day 
it debuted in 1970. 
But to celebrate its 35th anni­
versary next week, "All My Chil­
dren" came to her. 
"I wanted to do it but I 
couldn't get to New York, so 
they flew out here," says Bur­
nett, who has played the campy 
Southern gal Verla Grubbs sev­
eral times over the years. "I was 
really flattered. They flew Bi­
anca [actress Eden Riegel] and 
the gal who plays Simone [Terri 
Ivens] out here. They flew out 
Monday. We did it Tuesday, and 
they flew back Tuesday after­
noon which was really 
sweet." 
Grubbs - a very loud, fashion­
challenged character -pops up 
again next Wednesday in a Pine 
Valley cameo. 
Bianca is in a coma: T.R. (Tarnh Young) is being betrayed by his 
father, Adam (David Canary); 
and Erica (Susan Lucci) is bat­
tling over the paternity right to 
Baby Bess/Miranda (the name 
depends on who you believe the 
father to be). 
What is more, the show's cre­
ator and mother-figure, Agnes 
Nixon, will also make an appear­
ance on the show -her first 
ever. 
"Verla runs into Bianca in the 
hospital hallway," explains Bur­
nett, who is just finishing up 
work on her TV version of the 
musical "Once Upon a Mat­
tress," the show that launched 
her career. 
"Of course, Bianca is holding 
the baby and I'm just thrilled 
they're together. It's very cute 
because 1 say, 'Oh, I've been fol­
lowing your story with the sto­
len baby, the blood, the this and 
that and the lying blonde. I'm so 
happy you're back together: She 
exits and 1 just look up to 
hp~'Vpn -:=tnri C":l17 '~rlTT'loh("'\rl-.:r,," there, can't they be happy for 
just five minutes? Is that too 
much to ask?' " 
Apparently so, since even the 
babies on set aren't happy for 
more than five minutes. 
"They're twins and they're 
boys," says Burnett. "They can't 
go on being girls for long unless 
there's a whole new storyline 
and they go to their mother and 
say, 'You know, 1 want a sex 
change: 
"The baby that they use more 
often just lights up in front of 
the camera and really listens 
when people are talking. Unfor­
tunately, 1 made them both cry. 
"I think it was the way I was 
dressed. She wears the big wig 
and the loud voice and both of 
the little guys started fussing. 
We did get one take where [one] 
was quiet but when we wanted 
to do a close-up, we had to use a 
doll because I just scared them 
both and came on too strong," 
she laughs. ''I'm scaring babies 
ro ...... 1I .. P"</p>
