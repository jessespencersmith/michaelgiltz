7/25/2005 08:09:00 PMThis little detail is buried halfway down in a story aboutRovegate, also known as "Rove Endangers National SecurityScandal" and/or "Bush Misleads America In Runup To WarScandal." (The last one is the most important.)The White House response began at 9:30 a.m. on July 7, aMonday, as Mr. Fleischer briefed the press at the WhiteHouse. "There is zero, nada, nothing new here," he said ofMr. Wilson's claims. But under questioning, Mr. Fleischer'saccount became murkier. He seemed to concede, beforebacking away, that Mr. Bush's entire statement aboutSaddam Hussein's search for uranium in Africa mighthave been flawed.By evening, as Air Force One lifted off, officials on theplane were calling The Times and The WashingtonPost to make it clear that they no longer stood behindMr. Bush's statement about the uranium - the firstsuch official concession on the sensitive issue of theintelligence that led to the war.So no debate, people. Joe Wilson came forward with his op-ed andappearances on Sunday talk shows to say the President lied to theAmerican people in his State of the Union address. Bush made flatclaims that he KNEW he didn't have the evidence to back up. Theonly proof we need? The very next day, the White Housespokesperson Ari Fleischer started to admit Bush's central claimmight have been flawed. The very next day, they were calling thebiggest newspapers in the country to "make clear" they did not standbehind that claim.One day after Joe Wilson's public comments, Bush admitted hecouldn't back up what he said. They've tried to prevaricate and lieand whitewash this admission. They've smeared Joe Wilson andattacked his wife and endangered his children and weakened nationalsecurity all in an attempt to discredit it. But the White House neverhas and never will take back that retraction. They can't.If Bush wants to claim vindication, let him make that charge aboutHussein trying to get uranium in Niger all over again. If he can't, heshould apologize to joe Wilson and fire Rove and Scooter andwhomever else is involved.If anyone wants to pretend Joe Wilson was wrong, they've got toargue with Bush first. Bush retracted the very words Wilson objectedto. So argue with Bush. Not Wilson.
