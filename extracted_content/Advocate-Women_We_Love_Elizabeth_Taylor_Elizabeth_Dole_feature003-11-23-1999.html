DOLE 
SAYING EUZABETH DOLE'S SEEMINGLY lllGH 
VOTE of confidence an10ng our male readers is a sw'­
prise is an tmderstatement as grand as a certain canyon 
in Arizona True, before she dropped out of the presiden­
tial race in October, she had made polite noises about 
gay support, going so far as to say she wouldn't disquali­
fy someone for a post simply because he was gay. Still, 
that's a far cry from being proactive on gay issues. Per­
haps the things that endear Dole to some gay men are 
her talk show-host ability to chrum a crowd and her 
calm approach to a husband who 
shares his sexual impotence prob­
lems with the world. Rich Tafel, 
executive director of the gay 
group Log Cabin Republicans, 
says he thinks Dole's crunpaign 
shut down "because she doesn't 
have a message," but he adds, 
"She's a strong figure, and a lot of 
people respect that. " elizabeth 
TAYLOR 
WHO WOULDN'T WANT to be­
friend the woman who befriended 
Jan1es Dean, Rock Hudson, and 
Montgom ery Clift? "And Michael 
Jackson!" laughs playwright and 
screenwriter Paul Rudnick. Jack­
son may be straight, but the 
writer notes that the eternal diva 
has "befriended every gay male 
person in history." Larger-than­
life doesn't begin to describe her 
appeal. She's unlucky in love but 
ever hopeful. She's still one of the 
most beautiful women in the 
world. She has starred in film 
classics (Who's Afraid oj Vir­
ginia Wooif?) and notorious 
boondoggles (Cleopatra). And, of 
course, she's a hero. "She took 
great risks early on by linking her­
self to the AIDS crisis," notes pro­
ducer Baf1J' Krost. Other celebri­
ties are just following her lead. 
And we'd follow her anywhere.</p>
