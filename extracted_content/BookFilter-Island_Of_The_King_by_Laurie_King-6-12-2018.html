From the Publisher: Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes are back in
Laurie R. King’s New York Times  bestselling series—“the most sustained
feat of imagination in mystery fiction today” (Lee Child).  With Mrs.
Hudson gone from their lives and domestic chaos building, the last thingMary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, need is to help an oldfriend with her mad and missing aunt. Lady Vivian Beaconsfield has spentmost of her adult life in one asylum after another, since the loss of herbrother and father in the Great War. And although her mental state
seemed to be improving, she’s now disappeared after an outing from
Bethlem Royal Hospital . . . better known as Bedlam. Russell wantsnothing to do with the case—but she can’t say no. And at least it will gether away from the challenges of housework and back to the familiar
business of investigation. To track down the vanished woman, she brings
to the fore her deductive instincts and talent for subterfuge—and ofcourse enlists her husband’s legendary prowess. Together, Russell andHolmes travel from the grim confines of Bedlam to the winding canals andsun-drenched Lido cabarets of Venice—only to find the foreboding shadow
of Benito Mussolini darkening the fate of a city, an era, and a tormented
English lady of privilege.

<p>housekeeper Mrs. Hudson. King's refusal to "reset" the story at the end and return things as they were proved most
satisfying. Before that, "Dreaming Spies" had fun with its Japanese setting. But here the action and especially the mystery
feel rote. Russell and Holmes head to Vienna -- Russell to track down a seemingly mad heiress who may simply be a lesbian
fleeing "Bedlam" to make a life for herself; Holmes to scout out the rise of fascism for brother Mycroft. Little suspense canbe found in either quarter since fascism is most definitely on the rise and the woman of means with her lover proves to bejust as suspected, or should I say hoped for. Russell learns to drive a speedboat and coach a gay pal in the new fad ofwater skiing. Holmes dons a Zorro costume and charms Cole Porter to the point where Russell cheekily wonders if Porter is
hoping to misbehave with the great detective. It's all rather low-key and almost beside the point, more an idyll than an
adventure. With King having substantially raised the stakes last time around, she may have to choose between simply endingthe series or pushing it again into bolder, uncharted territory. -- Michael Giltz
