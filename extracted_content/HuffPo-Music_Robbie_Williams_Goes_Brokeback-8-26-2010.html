Only the Brits would ever be cheeky enough to do
something like this. Robbie Williams  has reunited with
boy band supergroup Take That but first he has a newsingle off his greatest hits compilation. It's a duet withfellow Take That-er Gary Barlow called "Shame" and
the video is absolutely priceless. Spoof isn't quite the
right word: it's an homage to Brokeback Mountain,with Williams and Barlow in a dusty small town,staring moodily at each other as they walk down the
street, dance with their unseen -- and apparently
unimportant -- girlfriends and so on. By the finale,they're sitting on a cliff, with Gary stroking Robbie's
plaid shirt and then the shirts come off. It's not campy
or silly -- though the result is indeed hilarious -- and it works so brilliantly because they were so close
together in the craziness of Take That and then split apart but are now back together. Someone elsemight have done a satire on Brokeback  and played it for laughs. This one gets the laughs but is just
delightful. His three-CD compilation is due out October 12.  He never quite broke out in the US, but
Williams is a huge star in the rest of the world.
Here's the video, followed by the original Brokeback Mountain trailer.
