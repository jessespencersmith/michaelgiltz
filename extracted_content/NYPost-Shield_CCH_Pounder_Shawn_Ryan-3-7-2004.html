• REALLY BIG SHOW 
Mackey gets'a lady boss 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
THE third season of "The Shield" gets 
off to a grisly start this Tuesday 
night. Members of the Armenian 
mob in Los Angeles are seen chopping off 
the feet of their enemies as they viciously 
track down the people who robbed them 
of a massive pile of cash. Rogue cop Vic 
Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his pals 
pulled off that neat heist during last sea­
son's finale. 
Now Mackey and his cohorts have to 
keep their noses relatively clean until the 
heat dies down, but the dirty cop is 
squarely in the sightlines of his new boss 
-the newly promoted Detective Clau­
dette Wyrns (C.C.H. Pounder). 
"Vic is trying to lay low and tame some 
of his more brutal cop tactics to keep off 
the police radar," says series creator 
Shawn Ryan. 
Season two of "The Shield" saw Vic and 
Claudette clash repeatedly for the simple 
reason that the fierce and fiercely artic­
ulate Pounder was one of the few actors 
who could go head-to-head with Chiklis 
and not get wiped off the screen. 
In "The Shield"'s new cycle of 13 epi­
sodes, viewers will see how Claudette 
handles power and ambition. Her promo­
tion comes as a bit of a consolation prize 
as she really coveted the chief of police 
position. Instead, says Ryan, Claudette 
gets "all of the headaches, but not all of 
the glory." 
Her first big challenge is to deal with 
the volatile Mackey. Rather than bring 
him down, Claudette decides to rein him 
in. 
"Let's have some serious derailment," Hard-boiled cops 
WlIgenbach (Jay 
KlIrne$) lind Wyms 
(C.e.H. Pounder) 
cupcakes compared 
to Mackey (Michael 
Chiklis, inset). 
says Pounder, 51, who is best known for 
her roles in the 1987 cult film "Baghdad 
Cafe" and on "ER." As Dr. Angela Hicks, 
Pounder excelled at keeping Dr. Romano 
-that show's former resident bulldog -
on a leash, 
"Because 1 put forward a whip-smart 
woman, so gee, what's taking so long [to 
nail Vicl? But then 1 know it takes a long 
time to take someone down in one of 
those situations," Pounder says. "Vic's got 
his fingers in a lot of pies. He's covered a 
lot of bases and people owe him favors." 
For Ryan, casting Pounder in a role that 
was originally written for a man was one 
of the luckiest days of his life. 
"I just feel like an idiot for not thinking 
of it sooner," says Ryan. "When I wrote 
the pilot, there were some good things in 
it aEld there were some mistakes . And one 
of them was [thatl I just went with the 
stereotype of the older male cop. I never 
gave it any serious thought as to why is 
this character a man. 
"When C.C. came in and read, not only 
did we realize it could be a woman, we 
realized it had to be a woman and it had 
to be her. [The detectivel became a much 
more interesting character with her play­
ing it than it was on paper." 
After spending four frustrating years on 
"ER" - a show for which Pounder re­
ceived an Emmy nomination, only to 
watch her character languish -"The 
Shield" is sweet redemption. 
"It's a fantastic opportunity," says the 
actress, whose initials stand for Carol 
Christine Hilaria. "She's completely un­
charted waters. I don't ever want to say, 
'Oh no, Claudette wouldn't do that.' I'd 
much rather say, 'What else can she do?' That's been the real fun of it. When 1 
said, 'Why can't she have a husband and 
children?' then husbands and children 
showed up!' I'm finally at a place where 
perhaps they do respect me as an actor 
and will take that leap." 
Pounder is also thrilled that Claudette, 
whose ex-husband died in the season fi­
nale, is taking a lover, a white construc­
tion worker brought in on a sweep who 
keeps finding excuses to come back to the 
station until Claudette asks him out. 
"It's about time," says Pounder, 51. "1 
think every 50-year-old watching TV is 
going to be saying, 'Yes!'" 
Though she's enjoying the stability of a 
central role on an acclaimed drama, 
Pounder still finds time to pursue re­
warding private intercsts. She and her 
husband Boubacar Kane are about to cel­
ebrate the tenth anniversary of the mu­
seum they founded together in Senegal 
(Pounder was born in Guyana). 
As for series creator Ryan, he just 
reupped for two more years on "The 
Shield." He also has a development deal 
with FX, but promises not to even begin 
working on other projects until he's fin­
ished the show's next two seasons. 
"This will be a very interesting year to 
see how the audience reacts," says Ryan. 
"Do they keep coming back or have they 
forgotten about us? 1 do think this is the 
kind of show you wouldn't want to push 
to seasons twelve and trurteen. With six 
or seven years of 13 to 15 episodes a sea­
son, we could end things pretty intact 
without embarrassing ourselves."
