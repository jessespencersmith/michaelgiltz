Lots of titles to catch up on, including a fresh take on Wuthering  Heights,  the last Baz
Luhrmann film I really loved, an amusing British comedy about an irascible doctor and
the always welcome release of new Criterion titles. Here we go.

<p>WUTHERING  HEIGHTS ($29.99 DVD;
Oscilloscope)
THE  GUILT  TRIP  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Paramount)
SILVER  LININGS  PLAYBOOK  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Weinstein/Anchor Bay)
PROMISED  LAND  ($34.99 BuRay combo; Universal)
THE  IMPOSSIBLE  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Summit) -- Emily Bronte's masterpiece
Wuthering  Heights  has been filmed umpteen times. But like a classic play, it's well worth
revisiting again and again. Still, most new versions aren't terribly interesting even though
every generation wants to tackle it. Not so here. Director Andrea Arnold has been a
technically fascinating talent. Here her formidable skills have been married to a passionatetale, bringing out a richness and humanity in her work not present before. This was one of
the most acclaimed films of the year, but was all but overlooked by the general public.
Well worth checking out.
Barbra Streisand has made so few films (relatively speaking) that each one feels like an
event. And it's disappointing when they're not up to snuff. She's been her own worst
enemy over the years, showing a Beatty-like reluctance to commit and overthinking herchoices. So I applaud everything about The  Guilt  Trip  -- it's loosey-goosey nature, it's
comedic nature, taking a chance on young talent -- yes, everything about it except themovie itself. Sigh.
Intellectually, I resisted Silver  Linings  Playbook,  a sentimental drama about two misfits
falling in love. Too obvious, too determined to move me, too heart-tugging. But the
excellent cast (De Niro hasn't been this restrained and good in a long time) won me over.No wonder they were all nominated for Oscars. I'm afraid a second viewing will be oneviewing too much for this pleasant little surprise. But for those who didn't catch it, this isa genial movie for adults.
Promised  Land  should have been Matt Damon's directorial debut. But he backed out and
handed the reins to director Gus Van Sant (in pure, mainstream studio mode here). Did
Damon sense the movie wouldn't quite fulfill its potential? Hardly, since he produced andco-wrote the script. It may also be just as telling for revealing the ambition andinteresting desire of actor John Krasinski ( The  Office ) who also co-wrote the script and
co-stars. Krasinski seems to be using his modest TV success to make interesting,intelligent films. This story nominally about fracking proves to be truly about people in aninteresting, relatively nuanced manner. Excellent cast, including Hal Holbrook as aschoolteacher and Frances McDormand as a love interest.
A big hit overseas, The  Impossible  is a classic type of Hollywood movie that uses a natural
disaster to show beautiful movie stars overcoming the odds to survive, surprising no one
in the process. Naomi Watts is the glamorous movie star/mother, Ewan McGregor is theglamorous movie star/father and anyone complaining that a big movie about a tsunamifocuses on the wealthy white tourists simply doesn't know much about Hollywood disaster
epics.</p>
<p>PIERRE  ETAIX:  THE  CRITERION
COLLECTION  ($59.99 BluRay; Criterion Collection) 
RICHARD  III  ($39.99 BluRay; Criterion Collection) -- It's been just about one year since
I first even heard the name of French director/actor Pierre Etaix. He labored in obscurity
simply because his films weren't being seen. (Legal troubles.) A circus performer besottedwith silent films, he created almost all his works in the 1960s firmly in the vein of JacquesTati. Last year, Film Forum in NYC  hosted a festival of his works to sold out crowds.
They've come back again this year. But for those who don't live nearby (or didn't catchthem on TCM recently), Criterion has produced a beautiful boxed set including 2010restorations of all his major work. You get five feature films -- including his masterpieceLe  Grand  Amour  -- three shorts, a documentary about his life and career by Etaix's wife
and more. He's still alive, having fled the disastrous pressures of movies after about adecade of brilliance to pursue his muse in the circus (usually, it works the other wayaround). A unique talent.
Why I wonder did Laurence Olivier direct so few films? Ignoring a TV movie, he directed
one Hollywood trifle ( The  Prince  And  The  Showgirl ), co-directed one Chekhov and
directed on his own three masterpieces of Shakespeare, each one acclaimed andcommercially successful around the world. Henry  V was a World War II morale booster,
Hamlet  an Oscar triumph and Richard  III  less so, but hardly disastrously so.
Interestingly, it was premiered on TV in the U.S. the same day it opened in movie
theaters. The TV airing reached tens of millions of people so not surprisingly the theatrical
version was a flop. But Olivier was nominated for Best Actor and its reputation has grownsince to the point where many would argue it's his best of the three. Yet for the next 34years of his career, no more Shakespeare and only two more films overall. What a pity.Criterion offers its usual thoughtful, illuminating extras, including a BBC interview ofOlivier by Kenneth Tynan, audio commentary by members of the RSC and more.

BRUCE  LEE
DOUBLE  FEATURE
THE  WAY  OF  THE
DRAGON/GAME
OF  DEATH  ($14.9
DVD; Shout) -- I still remember
working at Premiere magazine whenBaz Luhrmann's directorial debut
Strictly  Ballroom  was screening. People
were buzzing about this charming little
Australian film and the possibility it
might prove a crowd-pleasing indie hit.
I saw the movie and knew exactly whatthey were talking about. Here was atalent to remember. Unfortunately, it'sbeen downhill ever since, even though
that artistic slide has been showered with box office and Oscar glory. Certainly, The  GreatGatsby  doesn't look promising. So enjoy this amusing trifle about ballroom competition
long before Dancing  With  The  Stars  made that popular again. And wonder what might
have been. Or perhaps spot the excesses that seemed marginal here but would soon takecenter stage.
It's rare to find a directorial talent that seems genuinely fresh and unique but that's
exactly what Hal Hartley offered. He thoroughly deserves a string of releases in The HalHartley Collection, including his playful Flirt  (which tells the same story in three different
ways) and his relatively unheralded return to form Meanwhile . I savor Trust  and Simple
Men  most of all, but his entire body of work deserves this attention.
Bruce Lee will always be a tantalizing case of what-if since his career was so prematurelyshortened. He's both wildly popular and rarely respected, unlike say Jackie Chan whocrossed over to worldwide fame and Hollywood success in Lee's wake. Shout Factoryoffers inexpensive double features that include two of his best, each one on a disc withanother, lesser movie. Bargain basement prices for a world class talent.

Olive/Paramount)THE  FIGHTING  SEABEES  ($29.99
BluRay; Olive/Paramount)COPACABANA  ($29.99 BluRay;
Olive/Paramount) -- Robert Mitchumrarely got a chance to exude warmth(we preferred him stoic and tough) but
he did it very well. Here he's a</p>
<p>farmhand who knows
more about ponies
(and how to treat a
little boy) than the
kid's own father.Based on three shortstories by John
Steinbeck, The  Red
Pony  is a family film
in the best sense ofthe word with a great,
great score by Aaron
Copland.
Kirk Douglas hit his
stride fast in the
movies, with iconic
roles in Out  Of  The  Past,  Ace  In  The  Hole,  Detective  Story  and
The  Bad  And  The  Beautiful  almost overshadowing his key turn in
Champion  as a ruthless boxer determined to make it to the top.
The Ring Lardner story it's based on was so cynical that many
complained the story's punch was softened. But this cynicaldrama is no pushover and Douglas received an Oscar nominationfor his work.
Maybe half the reason America was convinced it couldn't lose
World War II was movies starring John Wayne. Sure, he was
fighting on a sound stage, but you could hardly imagine him doing anything but win. InThe  Fighting  Seabees,  he's a man overseeing construction who wrangles as much with
other military people as with the enemy; the movie tells about the creation of the Seabeesin quick, patriotic brushstrokes. Solid entry doing its bit for the war effort.
Copacabana  is a backstage comedy about the manager of Carmen Miranda, NOT an
adaptation of the Barry Manilow song. But even if it were, star Groucho Marx wouldn't
look any more lost. Without his brothers, he looks adrift in the movies. It would take a TVgame show to find him a fresh way to display his talents. It certainly ain't here thoughMarxists will want to take a look.

($29.99 DVD; Music
Box) -- Perhaps it wasthe Off Broadwaymusical I saw or the
novel The
Aviator'sWife.  But
those recent</p>
<p>endeavors had
me at theready to watch
a NOVA
special on one
of the mostfamous crimes
in American history, the kidnapping and killing of the Lindbergh baby. But this NOVAspecial is quite unworthy of PBS. Even for a single episode of an ongoing series, it feelsslapdash and cheesy. The "documentary" is filled with half-assed speculation, rumors ofrumors and heated suggestions that they might have something to reveal when in fact theydon't. It barely rises to the scholarly level of a History Channel special on UFOs. Anembarrassment.
The Ken Burns film The  Central  Park  Five  is certainly better. Co-directed with David
McMahon & Sarah Burns, it has the awful injustice of seeing young men imprisoned for a
crime they most clearly did not commit. A miscarriage of justice that the film detailsnicely. But as a film, there's nothing terribly effective or insightful here. The closer Burnsgets to the present, the less certain his instincts prove to be. But if it can bring a sense ofclosure, it will be worth it.
Vito  is a love letter to activist and historian Vito Russo. On the front lines for gay rights in
the 1970s, Russo will forever be remembered for his groundbreaking work on The
Celluloid  Closet , which hilariously and effectively illuminated the way gays had been
depicted by Hollywood. Anyone who hasn't read that book or seen the film based on it,should start there. Those who want to learn more about Russo will find plenty to savorhere.
Stephen Fry is a delightful companion on any subject. But this trifle tossed off for UK
television will certainly prove more effective on DVD than it was as a theatrical release,
which is more than this modest idea deserved.   Wagner  &  Me  is simply Fry agonizing over
the fact that he loves the music of Wagner but feels guilty since Wagner was such a
bastard and had been embraced, even co-opted by Hitler. If one gets the sneaking
suspicion that Fry agreed to this simply as an excuse to travel to Bayreuth and visit the
temple of Wagner located there, well frankly that just makes me like him more. Strictly forWagner fanatics.
Werner Herzog continues to deliver one fascinating, unexpected documentary after
another. This one -- co-directed with Dmitry Vasyukov -- heads deep into Siberia to find a
village of some 300 people. Only accessible by helicopter or boat, the Taiga people livemuch as they have for centuries. Happy  People  follows their lives for a year, with Herzog's
typically eccentric narration helping to avoid the mythologizing of "happy primitives" atleast somewhat.

Martin  out of the corner of my eye for a
number of years but finally caught up with it in
this collection. (The show is still ongoing and a new season returns this fall.) It's a genial,hour-long comedy about a high-powered London surgeon who develops a sudden horrorof blood that sends him to the small, seaside town of Portwenn where his aunt lives. He'sstuck as a GP surrounded by eccentric locals who don't enjoy his abrasive bedside manner.</p>
<p>Martin Clunes is very good as the doctor and now that I'm into season two, you can see
the show quietly improving (they dumped one very irritating minor character and
tightened the storylines). It's amiable comfort food of the Northern Exposure variety,though less oddball than that classic.
Was there ever any doubt James Garner would be a big star? I doubt it. I grew up with
The  Rockford  Files  so it's fun for me to discover how similar Jim Rockford is to Maverick,
a card sharp who would much prefer to slip quietly out of town rather than engage in agun fight. Garner is all charm here in this quirky, offbeat Western that must have seemed
like a fresh delight compared to all the sober westerns surrounding it on TV at the time.
Bizarrely, because it took so long to film an episode, they brought in another actor to play
his brother so production could continue apace. Bart was never as interesting as Bret
(even though they were essentially the same character). It's tempting to skip over Bart's
episodes and just watch Bret's though the most fun is when they appear together.
The  Lord  Peter  Wimsey  Complete  Collection  contains the Ian Carmichael take on the
genial British sleuth. You get five complete mysteries, with each book taken at a leisurely
pace for 16 hours of entertainment in all. If you've never read the Dorothy L. Sayers books
they're based on, you're in for an even better treat when you read them. It's hard not to
miss Harriet Walter as his love interest Harriet Vine from the 1980s adaptation, but it's
genial stuff nonentheless.
I'm just getting used to the great Michael Gambon in the UK take on Georges Simenon's
detective Maigret and here comes Sets 7 and 8 of the far more authentic Maigret  done in
French and starring Bruno Cremer as the reserved, patient crime solver. Each set containssic feature length films. Cremer played Maigret from 1991 to 2005, in 54 adventures in alland is certainly one of the most popular takes on Maigret. Kudos to MHZ for bringing outthis and many other TV shows not in English, shows that are rarely seen in the US at all.
Some actors simply don't work in period films. They're simply too "contemporary"
somehow. That may be the central problem with Jeremy Piven as the lead in Mr.Selfridge,  the story of an American coming to London and revolutionizing the retail
industry. Still, it's not the only one with stories a little more soapish when the unusualstory might have proven fascinating all on its own without the trappings of episodictelevision.
