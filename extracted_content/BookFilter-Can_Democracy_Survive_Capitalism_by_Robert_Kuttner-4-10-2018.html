Can Democracy Survive Global
Capitalism?
by Robert Kuttner
Price: $27.95 (Hardcover)
Published: April 10, 2018
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: In the past few decades, the wages of most workershave stagnated, even as productivity increased. Social supports have been
cut, while corporations have achieved record profits. Downward mobility
has produced political backlash. What is going on? Can Democracy SurviveGlobal Capitalism? argues that neither trade nor immigration nortechnological change is responsible for the harm to workers’ prospects.
According to Robert Kuttner, global capitalism is to blame. By limiting
workers’ rights, liberating bankers, allowing corporations to evadetaxation, and preventing nations from assuring economic security, rawcapitalism strikes at the very foundation of a healthy democracy. Theresurgence of predatory capitalism was not inevitable. After the Great
Depression, the U.S. government harnessed capitalism to democracy.
Under Roosevelt’s New Deal, labor unions were legalized, and capitalregulated. Well into the 1950s and ’60s, the Western world combined athriving economy with a secure and growing middle class. Beginning in the1970s, as deregulated capitalism regained the upper hand, elites began to
dominate politics once again; policy reversals followed. The inequality and
instability that ensued would eventually, in 2016, cause disillusionedvoters to support far-right faux populism. Is today’s poisonous alliance ofreckless finance and ultranationalism inevitable? Or can we find the
political will to make capitalism serve democracy, and not the other way
around? Charting a plan for bold action based on political precedent, CanDemocracy Survive Global Capitalism? is essential reading for anyoneeager to reverse the decline of democracy in the West.

<p>What We Say
The latest book from the co-founder of The American Prospect is enraging, enlightening and encouraging. It's also a little
messy and wildly ambitious. Kuttner begins with an unnecessary x-ray of President Trump's election, with the usual flurry ofpolls and breakdown of voters; then it provides a history of the post-WW II era and how and why the US economy flourishedlike never before or since; jumps to a wide-ranging look at how global capitalism and corporate elites have undermined
democracy and the rule of law all over the globe (aided and abetted by centrists and demagogues alike) and winds up with
a quick prescription for what ails us. Other than the opening chapter on the election, it's all essential and gripping, if densewith information. Kuttner argues that global capitalism is the enemy of democracy -- it has outstripped the ability ofnations to regulate their own economies and deliver on the social compact of providing for their citizens and planning theirfuture. When workers suffer because of this, they blame politicians and the government and the Other (immigrants,
Muslims, anyone not like them), not multinational corporations. Are the rigs ruled against workers? Oh yes. But for forty
years after World War II, the rules in the US favored society as a whole and Kuttner shows why. A rare convergence ofpolicies made it happen: very strict regulation of finance as the servant of the economy (rather than the master), strongunions that counter-balanced the power of the elites and the activist role of the government in overseeing and encouragingboth economic policy and the social benefits (Social Security, the GI Bill and the like) that grow from it. Those were
CHOICES and those choices can be made again, Kuttner says. But those choices have been dismantled since the 1970s by
Republicans and centrist Democrats alike, from Jimmy Carter (who cut the capital gains tax more than Reagan) to BarackObama. Kuttner passionately shares the history and dismal current state of affairs to show what was done in the past andwhat can most definitely be done again. The right choices will benefit society, the broad economy (as opposed to the
personal wealth of the 1%) and democracy itself. Maybe it won't send you off to read up on economist Michal Kalecki the
way it did me. Yet this book is challenging, rewarding and inspiring. The problems democracy face don't seem soinsurmountable when you know they've been solved before. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
Democracies govern nations, while global capitalism runs the world. Robert Kuttner provides a clear-eyed,
intellectually riveting account of how the inevitable tensions between the two have fueled neofascistnationalism here and abroad, and why the response must be a new progressive populism rooted in democracy
and social justice. Timely and compelling. - Robert B. Reich, chancellor’s professor of public policy,
University of California at Berkeley 
Robert Kuttner combines economic acumen, a gift for narrative, and genuine passion in his persuasive new book.
In his telling, the issue isn’t whether national economies should be open to foreign trade or finance. It’swhether the rules of the global economy are set up to benefit?ordinary citizens or merely economic elites. -Jacob S. Hacker,  Yale University and coauthor of Winner-Take-All Politics 
Kuttner brilliantly brings together two strands of thought: explaining both the economics and politics of globalcapitalism and how our society has abandoned core principles of fairness and equality. The rise of inequalityhelped pave the way for Donald Trump—a figure out of step with basic American values. Kuttner reminds us ofthe urgency with which we need to get back to a more just society. - Joseph E. Stiglitz, Columbia University,
winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and best-selling author of The Price of Inequality 
Standing on the shoulders of Karl Polanyi, Bob Kuttner revives the lost art of political economy in this absorbing
and important  analysis of wild markets, assaults on labor, and profound changes to institutional rules. - Ira
Katznelson, Columbia University and author of the Bancroft Prize–winning  Fear Itself: The New Deal and the
Origins of Our Time 
Democracy is no longer writing the rules for capitalism; instead it is the other way around. With his deep insight
and wide learning, Kuttner is among our best guides for understanding how we reached this point and what’s at
stake if we stay on our current path. - Heather McGhee, president of Demos 
Conventional wisdom has it that our income disparities and dysfunctional politics are the consequence of
inexorable and uncontrollable developments in technology, market competition, and globalization.  As Robert
Kuttner argues in this superb book, they are instead the result of our own policy choices. - Dani Rodrik, Harvard
University and author of Straight Talk on Trade and The Globalization Paradox
