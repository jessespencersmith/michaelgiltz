From the Publisher: A startling and eye-opening look into America’s First
Family, Never Caught  is the powerful narrative of Ona Judge, George and
Martha Washington’s runaway slave who risked it all to escape the
nation’s capital and reach freedom. When George Washington was elected
president, he reluctantly left behind his beloved Mount Vernon to serve inPhiladelphia, the temporary seat of the nation’s capital, after a brief stayin New York. In setting up his household he took Tobias Lear, hiscelebrated secretary, and nine slaves, including Ona Judge, about which
little has been written. As he grew accustomed to Northern ways, there
was one change he couldn’t get his arms around: Pennsylvania lawrequired enslaved people be set free after six months of residency in thestate. Rather than comply, Washington decided to circumvent the law.
Every six months he sent the slaves…

What We Say
This is the sort of popular history that makes you sit up and say, "I can't believe I never heard about this before!" Just as he
was nearing the end of his Presidency, George Washington found himself in a politically awkward, personally angeringsituation: one of his slaves had run away. Here's the story of Ona Judge, an enslaved woman who took the mighty risk of
fleeing the home of the most powerful man in the United States and defiantly said she'd rather die than go back to a life
under his thumb. Historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar was lucky that Judge was brave enough to give two interviews toabolitionist newspapers towards the end of her life, providing a rare chance to hear an enslaved woman's point of view.Share This Book

<p>Combining Judge's personal testimony with the copious letters and personal journals kept by George Washington, Martha
and many others, Dunbar is able to flesh out Judge's life and situation more fully than most people who managed to survive
the horrors of slavery. She combines specific details with the historical record to show the world Judge lived in, along with
the vagaries and psychological terror of life under even a "good" slave owner. Washington most assuredly saw himself thatway and simply couldn't understand WHY Judge would be so ungrateful as to flee being his property. Dunbar vividly createsthe layered reality of life in America for enslaved people, from Virginia (where Judge is surrounded by mostly black peoplein chains) to New York and Pennsylvania (where Judge sees free blacks outnumbering slaves at times and where the attitude
of whites towards slavery is ever-changing). It's a fascinating story, from the reality of Judge's world to the clueless nature
of slave catchers who must negotiate with Judge and are astonished she would talk back or refuse to do as she's told.Negotiate, you say? Yes, because Judge is in Pennsylvania, where abolition is dominating society and simply grabbing herwould be politically radioactive. (Not that this stops Washington from violating the very law he enacted -- the viciousFugitive Slave Act of 1793.) Judge takes the risk of a lifetime and succeeds, but at great personal cost. The ending of her
story is poignant and striking, a testament to the yearning for freedom. Dunbar's occasional need for assumption and
extrapolation when suggesting the mindset of Judge are modest and convincing. It's an engaging, surprising account thatbreathes new life into the stock figure of slavery's victims. And it will strike a blow to any still insisting the Founder Fatherswere gods among men, not to mention the even less favorable character of our nation's first First Lady. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“A fascinating and moving account of a courageous and resourceful woman.  Beautifully written and utilizing
previously untapped sources it sheds new light both on the father of our country and on the intersections of
slavery and freedom in the flawed republic he helped to found.”  - Eric Foner, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Fiery Trial and Gateway to Freedom
"Totally engrossing and absolutely necessary for understanding the birth of the American Republic,  Never
Caught  is richly human history from the vantage point of the enslaved fifth of the early American population.
Here is Ona Judge’s (successful) quest for freedom, on one side, and, on the other, George and Martha
Washington’s (vain) use of federal power to try to keep her  enslaved.” - Nell Irvin Painter, author of Sojourner
Truth, A Life, A Symbol
"Never Caught is the compelling story of Ona Judge Staines, the woman who successfully defied George and
Martha Washington in order to live as free woman. With vivid prose and deep sympathy, Dunbar paints a portrait
of woman whose life reveals the contradictions at the heart of the American founding: men like Washingtonfought for…
