'DOG' DAY AFTERNOON
A pooch lover seeks solace in
Mike White's film By MTcHAEL crLrz
a few days of feeling down, shouldn't she
be ready to get back to work?
But writer-director Mike White wants
to treat Peggiy's pain - and the fact she
devotes her life to animals - seriouslv.
"It's fun havingcharacters that are-of-
ten the butt of thejoke being front-and-
center," says White, 36, who wrote and
starred in the similarly off-center indie
"Chuck & Buck," as well as writing for the
cult TV show "Freaks and Geeks" and the
films "Orange County," "The Good Girl,"
"School of Rock" and "Nacho Libre."
"Their problems and their frustra-
tions [often] aren't taken seriously. But
also women - there are so many funny
comediennes, and they're always given
short shrift. It's fun to use whatever mojo
you have to try and give somebody else
a chance, and try to make something for
people who aren't always [appreciated] in
movies, particularly comedies. "
But using that mojo also means put-
ting yourself out there more. White says
that "Dog," his first directing gig, was a lot
more fun than he expected, thanks to ac-
tors like John C. Reilly, Laura Dem and
Shannon, a "Saturday Night Live" vet who
White worked with on his own short-lived
series, "Cracking Up." But eventually, he
says he got tired of being the decider.
"At some points, I felt like I could not
make one more decision," says White.
"Literally: 'I do not care whether she's
wearing the flower print skirt or the plaid
skirt.'But, no, I'm the director. It should
be all about wanting to make sure the
prints on the skirt are excctly what my
vision is. But sometimes I just couldn't
pretend that I gave a flip."HUI{G UP Molly Shannon plays a perky
pet lover whose beloved canine dies.
While he owns two dogs and two cats,
White says he's not an animal-rights fa-
natic. The movie, after all, isn't about join-
ing PETA so much as taking seriously the
people who find their passion in some-
thing other than the typical, proscribed
paths. And the carnivore film crew -
"[They've] gotta have ribs at least once a
week," laughs White - kept things from
getting sentimental. But even they were
swayed by a scene at an animal shelte4
where Pegg5r suddenly insists on adopting
every dog scheduled to be put to sleep.
"That was actually a working shelter,"
says White, "and there were in fact many
dogs that got adopted that dayby'hard-
headed' crew members." I</p>
