With Frost/Nixon  opening today in select cities,
Universal has found the right time to celebrate
director Ron Howard by releasing The RonHoward Spotlight Collection  ($39.98; Universal)
a nice boxed set of four of what they call his"most unforgettable and highly acclaimed films"along with the usual extras. The movies? ABeautiful Mind, Apollo 13, Cinderella Man  and
Backdraft . The only problem? These aren't even
close to his four best movies. Howard is apurveyor of middlebrow entertainment, which isa rude way of saying "movies." He doesn't work in
the personalized vein of an auteur or the seat-of-your-pants indie world and he's never quiteenjoyed the prestige of the top-notch directors like Spielberg or Anthony Minghella, despite themany Oscar nominations and consistent box office success his movies enjoy. (I'm still bummedApollo 13  -- or Babe  or Sense and Sensibility  -- didn't beat out  Braveheart  in 1995 for the Best
Picture Oscar.) Still, you can't dislike a guy who narrates Arrested Development  or made an Obama
ad that genially spoofed his TV acting career. Howard would have flourished in the studio system --
he's clearly shown a workmanlike ability to move from comedy to period piece to drama with ease.If I were gonna choose four movies to make the case for Howard, I'd pick Apollo 13, The Missing(his Western with Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett), Parenthood , and Cocoon . I even had to
debate about Splash  and Night Shift , too. His misfires are fewer but painful: Willow, Far And
Away, How The Grinch Stole Christmas  and The Da Vinci Code.  But for all that, I think Universal
would have served Howard better -- and celebrated their unique partnership (Howard has madevirtually every one of his films with that studio) -- by releasing ALL his movies in one lavish boxedset and labelling it "Volume One." It looks like "Volume Two" would begin with another Oscarnominee in Frost/Nixon , so the story continues. What four movies of Ron Howard do you think
are his best?

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: Ron Howard Vs. Ron Howard
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-ron-howard-vs-ron-ho_b_148830.html [4/5/2009 12:58:07 PM]hit after another but gets no respect, Wong Kar-Wai is -- by almost universal acclamation -- the
coolest director in the world. (And here's hoping his recent stumbles of 2042  and My Blueberry
Nights are not the sign of a permanent decline.) One big reason is his breakthrough hit Chungking
Express  ($39.95 and coming out at the same price on BluRay December 16; Criterion). Everything
is here: the slow motion, the emotionally acute visuals via the great Christopher Doyle, the
obsessive repetition of a pop song (in this case the Mamma and the Pappas "California Dreamin'")
and that indefinable cool. Extras include TV interviews w Wong and Doyle, commentary by a critic
and new subtitles. Also out from Criterion: Richard Burton's wonderfully contained performance in
the deeply cynical Le Carre adaptation The Spy Who Came In From The Cold  ($39.95; Criterion)
and Sam Fuller's racism parable White Dog  ($29.95; Criterion) which I've never seen and look
forward to checking out.
SNL VS. SNL  -- Chevy Chase was long gone, but the fourth season of SNL  ($69.98; Universal) is
so vital and funny and silly and smart that it could easily be ranked as the best season in the
show's history. The Blues Brothers, The Loud Family (it doesn't get enjoyably dumber than that),
Nick The Lounge Singer, my personal favorite the Nerds (Bill Murray and Gilda Radner), SteveMartin with Dan Ackroyd as the wild and crazy Festrunk brothers and on and on. Then there arethe musical guests: Talking Heads, Grateful Dead, Rickie Lee Jones, Van Morrison, James Taylor,the Rolling Stones, Devo, the Doobie Brothers and more. What a great show and these completeseason boxed sets do it justice.
STOP! DO NOT GO ON!  -- Not until you've read about The Gospel At Colonus  ($26.95; New
Video), one of the landmark musicals of the past three decades. The idea was simple: present
Oedipus at Colonus as a tale of woe presented in a church, complete with gospel numbers. "I takemy text today from the Book of Oedipus," intones a young Morgan Freeman, who is electrifyingand commanding as the preacher/narrator. This 1985 Philadelphia performance was captured forTV with care and discretion by Kirk Browning, who knows you don't need to cut every five secondsto create excitement. All you really need are talented performers like Jevetta Steele, Robert EarlJones and Clarence Fountain and the Five Blind Boys Of Alabama and great songs by Lee Breuerand Bob Telson."How Shall I See You Through My Tears?," "Stop! Do Not Go On!," "Lift Him Up"and the moving "A Voice Foretold" are among the nonstop highlights. This is brilliant stuff and I'vealways been disappointed that I never got to see it live and had to settle for listening to the castalbum. No more.
ANOTHER BANNER YEAR FOR DOCUMENTARIES  -- Obviously, inexpensive portable
cameras have revolutionized documentaries. Add in the flood of reality shows and the result is that
people are more willing to go see documentary films in the theater and on TV now more than ever.Many of my favorite films this year are documentaries and still I can't keep up with the flood ofreleases. Among the many companies producing them are Arts Engine, which celebrates its 10th
Anniversary of making documentaries happen with an elaborate boxed set ($99.95; Arts Engine
available at their website ), which collects eight movies and 24 short films. Among my favorites are
Election Day , which interwove the story of people voting on November 2, 2004; and Arctic Son,
about a young man heading back to Old Crow (a town about 80 miles from the Arctic Circle) to
reconnect with his father. Both were seen on PBS's invaluable P.O.V. series. And I'm intrigued by
stories of Puerto Rican Americans trying to make it in New York City, tales of woe in the criminaljustice system and Brother Born Again,  about a bisexual Jewish woman trying to make sense of
her brother who dropped out of college and was born again. Then there are the numerous shorts....
TODAY VS. YESTERDAY  -- The original Robert Wise version of The Day The Earth Stood Still
($19.98; Fox) is a quiet, thoughtful, philosophical film -- rather appropriate for a movie about
aliens urging humans to unite and embrace peace. Or else. The new Keanu Reeves film outDecember 12 -- at least from  the trailer  -- seems chockful of apocalyptic explosions. Hmmm. Have
we learned our lesson?
BLURAY  -- Yeah, you're gonna have to buy a BluRay player. Among the new releases on BluRay
are Hancock  ($39.95 or $34.95 for the regular DVD special edition; Sony), which has a great
premise and an okay follow-through but Will Smith is engaging as always and the action looks
amazing. If you haven't seen the film, uh, try not to look too closely at the cover art or you'll realizeit contains a spoiler. Extras include a digital copy, both theatrical and unrated versions, and aBluRay exclusive of on-set visual diaries. The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian  ($40.99 or
$39.99 for the regular DVD special edition; Disney) has even more action and derring-do than thefirst in the series, which means it has strayed even farther away from the simple, gentle heart of

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: Ron Howard Vs. Ron Howard
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-ron-howard-vs-ron-ho_b_148830.html [4/5/2009 12:58:07 PM]the books by C.S. Lewis. No wonder it stumbled at the box office. When will they realize that
"Narnia" is not an action franchise? Ben Barnes as Caspian poses like a runway model on the DVDcover but I'll take Peter or Edmund as heroes over Caspian any day. Loads of DVD extras and thecomputerized special effects do play better on BluRay. If Criterion's The Spy Who Came In FromThe Cold wasn't enough Richard Burton for you, dive into Becket  ($34.98; MPI), his costume epic
about the Chancellor with a soul, which proves awfully inconvenient. Finally, what better way toremember George Carlin than by watching It's Bad For Ya ($24.98 or $19.98 on regular DVD;MPI), which shows Carlin as irascible and often as funny as ever?
MORE MOVIES  -- I wanted to believe in The X-Files: I Want To Believe  Special Edition
($34.98; Fox) but it proved just a so-so episode of the series. Still, fans who skipped it in the
theaters should find enough reason to check it out. An ok episode is better than no episode at allfrom one of the best sci-fi series in TV history. Wanted Special Edition  ($34.98; Universal) is an
enjoyably ludicrous action flick with James McAvoy of all people proving he can carry a gun with
aplomb. Chad Lowe's directorial debut is the low-key Beautiful Ohio  ($19.95; IFC) with an
excellent cast including William Hurt, Julianna Margulies, Michelle Trachtenberg and newcomer
Brett Davern. Lower Learning  ($26.97; Anchor Bay) is a comedy about teachers starring Jason
Biggs, Eva Longoria Parker and Rob Corddry that has little to recommend it. The title is the
funniest thing about it, I'm afraid. Israeli film My Father My Lord  ($29.95; Kino) is a critically
acclaimed story about life in an ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community. Two new indie gay releases --
Between Something & Nothing  and Into It  ($29.95 each; Waterbearer Films) -- both center around
male prostitutes, which is like having 90% of movies about straight people center around drug
dealers. No wait, that was the stereotype for blacks in the Seventies. It's like having them all be
hookers. No, that's still the stereotype for women -- try to find a working actress who hasn't played
a whore; it ain't easy. Ah well.
TV ON DVD  -- The Best Of Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist  ($19.99; Paramount) is a good
introduction to the squiggly series about the best therapist since Bob Newhart. If they'd been a
little more generous with the running time, this would be all you need. Daniel Boone Season 6($49.95; Liberation) is the last season of the Western starring Fess Parker, who forever kept meconfused as to the difference between Boone and Davy Crockett since he played both of them. Theshow was never a huge hit, but it peaked at #21 in its fifth season until the smash hit Family Affairsent it packing. You get all 26 episodes and some modest extras and the chance to have that themesong lodged in your brain all over again. 24: Redemption  ($26.98; Fox) wasn't a smash in the
ratings but it was lean and tough (I loved the ad that said "Hope has a fighting chance" and showedBauer packing some serious heat) and is a good sign for the new season in January. Law & OrderSixth Year  ($59.98; Universal) is the latest release in the venerable crime season They better speed
them up or they'll never catch up to the show itself. Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. The Final Season($39.98; Paramount) was the fifth and last season for the worst Army recruit since Beetle Bailey.But he did have a lovely singing voice. Mister Peepers Season 2  ($39.95; S'more) is the fifties
sitcom about a shy, unassuming science teacher (Wally Cox). I think he would have got alongswimmingly with the blithe schoolteacher at the heart of Mike Leigh's Happy Go Lucky , one of the
better films of the year. This is the season where Peepers marries his sweetheart, NurseRemington. William Conrad was an unlikely TV star, so unlikely that one show called him simplyFatman. But Cannon Season One Volume Two  and Jake and the Fatman Season One Volume Two
($37.99 each; Paramount) both show him commanding the screen with authority. And viewersfollowed him everywhere: I can remember Fatman  bouncing all over the TV schedule and viewers
tracking it down and keeping it a hit wherever it was placed. Now that's  a star.
FAMILY AFFAIR -- One of the best DVDs of the week just happens to be perfect for familyviewing -- but don't let that stop you if your family's not around. Sounder  ($14.98; Koch) is a tear-
jerker with Cicely Tyson in top form as a woman holding her family together during theDepression. Misty  ($14.98; Koch) isn't up to those high standards but it's fine, especially for animal
lovers who can't get enough of children-and-their-horse movies. The Longshots  ($28.95;
Dimension/Genius) is the modern equivalent of those flicks, with teddy bear Ice Cube discoveringhis neice sure knows how to throw a football. The Nutty Professor  ($19.98; Weinstein/Genius) is
an animated spin on the Jerry Lewis classic. It's done on the cheap but Drake Bell is an appealinglead and Lewis was born to do voice work; quick, someone call Pixar. Two so-so movies proveanimated cartoons shouldn't always make the leap to the big screen: Hey There, It's Yogi Bear andThe Man Called Flintstone  ($19.98 each; Warner Bros.). Don't feel bad, guys.

ETC.  -- Paul Simon: Live From Philadelphia  ($9.98; Eagle Rock) is a bare bones concert just 53
minutes long with Simon at a crossroads: his movie One Trick Pony would flop and he'd record a
reunion album with Art only to erase Art's vocals and release Hearts & Bones  to relative
indifference before finally being reborn with Graceland . But you can't have any doubt he'd endure
when Simon can reel off songs like "Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard," "Something So Right"and "Late In The Evening." Rush: Snakes & Arrows Live  ($24.98; Zoe) with the prog rock
institution finally getting some respect from Rolling Stone and proving why in this October 2007concert in the Netherlands. Nickelback: Live At Sturgis 2006 ($19.98; Koch) captures a band thathopes they won't have to wait that long for their respect, but a 12 song set (even in high def) andonly available at Wal-Mart (I hate exclusives) is no way to earn it. Orthodox Stance  ($24.95; C3) is
an acclaimed documentary about a Russian immigrant who wants to both box and remain anobservant Jew. Other new documentaries include A Man Named Pearl  ($26.95; Docurama) about
a man who fights prejudice with a weed whacker; The World Within  ($29.95; Kino) about the ideas
of Jung; and  In The Gutter ($19.97; Anchor Bay) an unremarkable look at gross-out comedies.
Animal lovers will enjoy the boxed set Growing Up  ($39.95; Genius), which includes five DVDs
covering baby animals as in Growing Up Primates, Growing Up Wildcats, Growing Up Arctic andso on. If you're not cold enough, Arctic Exposure ($24.95; Genius) is a five part series followingzoologist Nigel Marven as he travels all over the Canadian Arctic. And folks who hate choke chainswill love The Loved Dog by Tamar Geller  ($19.95; New Video), a warm and fuzzy approach to
working with your dog. Finally, two over-stuffed wrestling DVD sets: The History of theIntercontinental Championship  and Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero  ($34.95 each;
WWE) and both filled with more than 25 matches and loads of extras.
So tell me, what do you think are Ron Howard's four best movies?

You got me. Early on, he wasn't with them. And Da Vinci Code was a huge property he came on to
later. Oh and Ransom was also Disney (ie Touchstone). But since 1989 a good 90% of his movieshave indeed been for Universal. When you toss in the movies he and Brian grazer have produced forUniversal, the projects they've brought to that studio are so many that people talked about the two ofthem running the studio at one point. I've associated them in my mind for so long with the studio that Ifailed to make the proper caveat. but given their intense relationship w Universal, I still think that just
four movies when they had nine in all (and could have licensed the others easily enough) wasn't giving
his work proper due.
