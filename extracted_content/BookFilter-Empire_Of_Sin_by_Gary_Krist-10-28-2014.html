Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis history of New Orleans -- or more specifically of Storyville, the sin-filled epicenter of that city -- begins like acrime novel. A horrific ax murder rekindles memories of a rampaging assassin many years ago. Author Gary Kristdeftly jumps back in time and uses these bursts of violence to tell his real story. That tale is the battle of New Orleansover its soul. It began when the city was overrun with prostitution and gambling and sin of every nature. The prim andthe proper worked with the politicians who weren't in on the take to isolate this depravity into an area that was soondubbed Storyville. And that's when the real fun began. For decades, the semi-legal status of vice in thatneighborhood allowed it to flourish and the brothels and gambling dens of New Orleans became infamous the worldover. And black Storyville helped launch jazz into the world, offering another panoply of characters of the musical kid,climaxing with Louis Armstrong. Krist covers it all in vivid form, from madams who vow to give it all up (after theymake one last pile of cash) to the "mayor" of Storyville who held it all together in his strong but genial grip, TomAnderson. Gang wars, petty jealousies, political machinations and lots of liquor and guns give this narrative a realkick. And Krist brings it all back to those terrible crimes with panache. Of course, New Orleans then stamped out vicefor good (or as much as one can stamp out human nature), only to turn around and realize its unsavory reputationwas good for tourism and embrace it all over again. This highly entertaining work shows where that good/bad namebegan. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for Empire of SinWashington Post's Top 10 Best Books of 2014Seattle Times Best Books of 2014Library Journal’s Top 10 Best Books of 2014"[A] well-reported and colorful tale of jazz, sex, crime, and corruption.

He also allows his characters and sources plenty of opportunity to speak, with the result a delightfulconversation. The remainder of Storyville’s tale…provides ample fodder for Mr. Krist’s talent as a storyteller andstrength as a researcher.
