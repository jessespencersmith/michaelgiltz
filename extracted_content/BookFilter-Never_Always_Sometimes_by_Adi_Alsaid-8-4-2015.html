Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayJohn Green. There I got that out of the way. It's nigh on impossible to talk about a guy writing young adult novelsabout hyper-witty teenagers in love without mentioning John Green. Alsaid earns his place alongside Green with hissecond novel. It's got a made for the movies premise: a guy and a girl who are best friends but of course NOT in lovewith each are on the cusp of high school. They make a list of all the things they should avoid, the cliches of teenager-dom as laid down by the movies and TV. And avoid them they do until senior year just weeks before graduationwhen they rediscover the list and impulsively decide to do EVERYTHING on the list: go to a beer party, becomeknown for a favorite seat location at lunch, take an epic road trip and so on. Of course, on the list is Never Date YourBest Friend but they leave that one unspoken, for a while. Alsaid's tale is fun and breezy until it's not so breezy andhe has a nicely jaundiced take on his hero and heroine. Their too cool for school attitude? It's part of who they are,but they realize they've also missed out and dismissed a lot of their classmates by considering them types (the Jock,the Geek) instead of people. Becoming popular (or at least friendly with others) isn't so bad and suddenly our herofinds himself dating a girl, a really cool girl, even though he's been pining for the heroine for all of his life despite thefacf that THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE! The book goes on past where I thought it would end, which is a good thing.Alsaid creates some real characters here and their journey isn't neatly schematic. The dialogue is amusing, thestunts they engage in (like building a tree fort lunch spot overnight) sometimes cinematic but still within the realm ofreality) and the romance/friendship at the heart of it has real weight. John Green (and Judy Blume and S.E. Hintonand Sherman Alexie) would approve. -- MIchael GIltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
