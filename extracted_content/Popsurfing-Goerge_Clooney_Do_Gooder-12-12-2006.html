Personally, I'd much rather see a celeb use their fame for apurpsoe they deem important, whether or not I agree with them. Ithink Michael J. Fox AND Patricia Heaton of "Everybody LovesRaymond" deserve kudos for getting involved in the issue of stem cellresearch, even if I know Heaton is wrong. And now Roger Friedman ofFoxNews.com reports that George Clooney and Don Cheadle areattempting some sort of diplomatic mission to China about Darfur,hoping to pressure them into taking a proactive stance on the genociderather than just buying oil and supplying people with weapons. Thehoped-for leverage: their image in the upcoming Olympics in Beijing.This sounds like a remarkably complex manuever for Clooney and evenseems to perhaps tread too close to foreign policy affairs, but who am Ito say he shouldn't do whatever he can to stop genocide when the Bushadministration clearly doesn't care and has refused to act in anysubstantial way for years now? Mock all you want, but if he was justpartying away the same critics would dismiss that as typical Hollywoodself-indulgence.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
