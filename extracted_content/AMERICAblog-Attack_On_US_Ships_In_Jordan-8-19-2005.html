8/19/2005 10:50:00 AMRockets were launched but failed to strike two US ships inharbor at Jordan and at a Jordanian hospital. No US troopswere injured, though one Jordanian soldier was killed by astray missile. It's the first attack on US ships in that regionsince the attack on the Cole in 2000. But an attack on US shipssurely isn't enough to end Bush's vacation. What would it taketo get Bush back to work?
