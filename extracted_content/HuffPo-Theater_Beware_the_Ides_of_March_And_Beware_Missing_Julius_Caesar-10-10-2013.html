JULIUS CAESAR  **** out of ****
ST. ANN'S WAREHOUSE
Two of my favorite theatrical venues -- the Donmar Warehouse  in London and St.
Ann's Warehouse  in New York City -- have combined to offer an exciting new
production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar . It's the best Julius Caesar  I've ever seen
(admittedly a low bar since it's never been a favorite) and certainly one of the top
shows of the year.
On the surface, the bells and whistles are many. Directed by the keenly intelligent
Phyllida Lloyd, this show is set in a maximum security prison; features an all-femalecast in this most masculine of plays; and it includes numerous modern touches from apunk-ish rock and roll score to television sets, a tricycle and video cameras. But in avery real sense, none of this matters.
All these elements inform the play but they do not define it. The setting, the casting,
the music and the props help anchor the actors and the audience. Yet what makes
Lloyd's Julius Caesar  great is what makes any notable mounting of Shakespeare
great: the direction is focused and inventive while the performances are clear as abell, moving and believable at every moment.
When poorly performed, you can sometimes struggle just to understand the dialogue
of Shakespeare and what's even going on. (Just check out Broadway's Romeo &Juliet -- a far simpler play -- for a good example of that, especially in the garbled
opening scenes.) Here we truly understand  everything. We understand the action on
every level, the sense of what they're saying, the meaning behind it, the emotions justunder the surface and more.
Caesar (Frances Barber) hasreturned to Rome in triumph,surrounded by fawningworshippers and true friends likeMark Antony (Cush Jumbo) whourges the crown on Caesar only tohave Caeser turn it down three
times...though ever so reluctantly.
The tide is turning against a
republican form of government and
it's inevitable perhaps that thegreat Caesar will become adictator. A benevolent one,perhaps, but a dictatornonetheless.
Brutus (Harriet Walter) won't have
it. Urged on by Cassius (JennyJules) he -- I almost wrote "she" bythe way, so completely do theseactors take over these parts thatthe gender seems both secondaryand yet inextricably linked to them-- yes, he, Brutus, loves Caesarbut agrees to kill the man to savethe country. They succeed, Romeis plunged into chaos and a battlefor supremacy takes place
between the forces led by Antony
and Octavius (Clare Dunne) andthose of Brutus and Cassius.
Antony's famed funeral speech is a
good example of how this production's touches enliven the story without imposing on
it. Antony follows Brutus's very reasonable and convincing speech with hisMay 14, 2014

<p>blandishments that Brutus is an honorable man. On and on he builds his case, until
it's clear that Antony's repeated claims of how these men who brutally slaughtered
Julius Caesar are honorable is a sarcastic retort.
The crowd is huddled around a TV set, watching his speech live on the air. A more
banal production might turn this into a heavy-handed commentary on mass media
and how easily people can be swayed by such. That might work on a very basic level,but it's beside the point, since that's neither the text nor the subtext of this scene.
Here the television set is simply a quick and clever way to illustrate how Antony is
playing to the masses and whipping them up with his oratory. Brutus may havespoken sincerely but Antony has both sincerity and a savviness about what works
with the people on his side. That trumps plain honesty every time. The simple use of
the television gets this idea across swiftly, neatly and with humor and notably without
distracting from the story at hand.
Jumbo is so very good as Antony, palling around with Julius, reacting with animal-like
cleverness when surrounded by conspirators, leading an effective backlash and yet,somehow, always trumped whether it's by Julius or Brutus or in the very clever finalewhere Octavius steals his moment of triumph by stepping on the line, "This was aman!"
I'd say she stole the show if each actor in the spotlight didn't also seem to steal it both
before and after her. Jules is Cassius, the tempter that pricks Brutus's high opinion ofhimself to set the plot in motion. She commands the stage so easily, I thought, "Who
the heck is this?" That sense of discovery continued throughout for every actor new to
me.
Of course Frances Barber as the easily flattered Julius is always good. Her disastrous
decision NOT to beware the Ides of March is wittily and frighteningly done. (You don'twant to ever get on Julius's bad side.) And Harriet Walter is wonderful as Brutus.She'll always be the perfect Harriet Vine to me (from TV's Lord Peter Wimsey ) but
Walter is an accomplished Shakespearean. Her Brutus banters with a servant,wrestles with his conscience and howls at fate with an anguished believability that letsthis Brutus be a complex, changeable creature rather than merely defining him as,say, prone to vanity over his importance or some other such "take" on the role.
I don't mean to downplay how much the prison setting and other touches allow these
great performances to flourish. Walter is allowed an emotional release when theaction pauses and the guards of the prison herd the cast off stage at the end, giving aglimpse into the high price paid by the actors on the stage of history and the actors ina show, even presumably hardened criminals. The brief passages of rock and roll(from a score by Gary Yershon) aren't just modern paint on an old setting: they echothe chaos of war and events spiraling out of control. When Barber as Julius Caesartakes over the drums to rat-a-tat out the deaths of his murderers, it's a fittingly precise
depiction of revenge from beyond the grave.
Similar delights abound, from the austere setting (a hallmark of St. Ann's Warehouse
where each show seems to create its own perfect space) to the amusing signs in the
restrooms warning visitors to the prison about illegal contraband, courtesy of designerBunny Christie. The lighting by Neil Austin, the sound by Tom Gibbons and themovement by Ann Yee are all superlative. I wasn't quite into it at the very start of theshow when Julius Caesar led his admirers in a rousing bacchanal, highlighted by ahand-raising flourish they all mimicked. But it paid dividends at the end, when thatsame movement was repeated by Dunne as Octavius, emphasizing how often theleaders can change but the story of power and the struggle to gain and keep itremains the same.
