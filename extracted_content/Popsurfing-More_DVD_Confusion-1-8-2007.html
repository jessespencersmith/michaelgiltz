            <p>M O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 8 ,  2 0 0 7More DVD ConfusionThe traditional media seems to be swallowing the press releases ofDVD manufacturers whole this week. First, they decided that eventhough people had rejected Blu-Ray and HD-DVD discs, that for somereason they would love to pay even more for a DVD that containedboth. Now, the same thing is happening with DVD players. Consumershate confusion (I know I do) and they've wisely stayed away from bothformats, even with players costing $600 to $1000 (not a ton for a newgeneration of player). But if they don't like those, why would they pay$1200 for a DVD player that plays BOTH HD-DVD and Blu-Ray? Theydon't want both formats. They want neither, frankly. They're perfectlyhappy with DVDs right now and unless you pay $1500 for a flat panelTV that's 1080p compatible and THEN buy a player for say $800 andTHEN buy a new DVD format for $30 to $40 (double what standardDVDs cost) you won't see any difference. You can't just do one of thesethings, the way you could buy DVDs and see a massive improvementeven on your old TV. Nope, you've got to do them all. Meanwhile, DVDsare a massively profitable category, with $24 billion spent on sales andrentals of DVDs and the ever-shrinking VHS every year for the pastthree years. That's more than two and a half times the money spent atthe box office and it doesn't include overseas, cable, vidoe on deman,satellite and so on. Overall, movies are generating almost $50 billion ayear.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Check out the Oppo up-converting DVD playerat Amazon. It's not a name brand like Toshiba or Sony but it actuallyperforms -- and for a fraction of the price.8:40 AM
