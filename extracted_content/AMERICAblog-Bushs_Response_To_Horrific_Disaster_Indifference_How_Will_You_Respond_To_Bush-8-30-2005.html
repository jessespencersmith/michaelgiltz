8/30/2005 05:36:00 PMWe've got a lot of good arguments posted here from John andRob and Joe and Chris. Use them, add your own and startwriting letters to the editor of your local newspapers, tvstations and radio outlets -- not to mention your electedrepresentatives.-- President Bush staying on vacation when EVERYONE knew amassive hurricane was getting ready to strike-- President Bush flogging politics AFTER the hurricanedestroyed New Orleans and Biloxi; the President joshing withMcCain over birthday cake while the waters were rising-- President Bush's father sending 25,000 troops afterHurricane Andrew. Either his dad was WASTING time andmoney or W is falling far short of his father. Again.-- President Bush pushing a joke of an energy bill that didNOTHING to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, nothingsignificant to develop alternative fuels and nothing tostrengthen our infrastructure. Now we can see how vulnerableit is since one storm is impacting our nation's ability to refineoil.-- President Bush going back to Texas for another night ofvacation instead of going straight to the White House AFTERthe disaster struck.--President Bush jamming on the guitar while the disasterworsens.-- President Bush finally, grudgingly ending his vacation twodays early and going back to DC. If he can stay in touch inTexas, why go back, as John says? If he needs to be back inDC, what the hell took so long?-- President Bush's backdoor draft that abused the compactbetween the country and the brave men and women whovolunteered for the National Guard and Army Reserve hasdamaged them for decades to come. Many fewer peopleleaving the Army are going to volunteer for these groups in thefuture. And this natural disaster reminds us all of how vitalthey are.-- Widespread looting that one observer said made NewOrleans look like downtown Baghdad. How many times canBush turn a bad situation into a disaster before people startcatching on?-- The Coast Guard is saving lives left and right. They areperennially underfunded but President Bush has given theCoast Guard massive new responsibilities to guard our coasts,inspect ships and more all while helping in emergencies likethis. So in a post 9-11 world, his attempt to DELAY forDECADES the essential upgrading of the Coast Guard's shipsthat date to the Vietnam and Korean war is offensive andinexcusable.
