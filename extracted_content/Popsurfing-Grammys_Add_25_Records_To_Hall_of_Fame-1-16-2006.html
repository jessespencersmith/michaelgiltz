            <p>M O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 6 ,  2 0 0 6Grammys Add 25 Records To Hall of FameThe Grammys added 25 new recordings to their Hall of Fame --everything from turn of the century 78s to Barbra Streisand's debut.Most of the choices make sense: Jimi Hendrix's "Axis of Love" (whichgives Hendriz a hat trick), BB King's essential "Live at the Regal," theO-Jays single "Love Train," the Weavers with "Goodnight Irene" andBessie Smith with "Downhearted Blues."But some of it is head-scratching. I think "Hair" is fine for a timecapsule, but should the original cast album really be in the Hall ofFame? And I've never been a fan of "An American in Paris" but we'llleave that alone for the real head-scratcher -- Bob Marley's "Exodus."Marley is already in the Hall with the singles "No Woman, No Cry" and"Get Up, Stand Up" (as well as Eric Clapton's cover of "I Shot TheSheriff"). But this is his first album to be included. I don't know anyonewho would start with "Exodus." It's very good, but nothing compared to"Catch A Fire" and "Burnin'" and "Natty Dread" and "Live!" Heck, I'dprobably even start with the greatest hits compilation "Legend," one ofthe best-selling albums of all time.Even worse are the omissions. They've already inducted both the castand soundtrack for "West Side Story" but still no other Sondheim.Michael Jackson is in there for the Jackson 5's "I Want You Back" butkeeping "Thriller" (and even "Off The Wall") out is just foolish. Finally,the complete lack of rap and hip hop makes the Hall of Fame a joke. NoPublic Enemy's "It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back?" NoRun DMC? No "White Lines" from Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel andthe Furious Five? No Dr. Dre? No Beastie Boys? Not even "SugarhillRap," the first Top 40 rap/hip-hop hit? The Hall is filled with blackartists so they're not being racist. Just stupid.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
