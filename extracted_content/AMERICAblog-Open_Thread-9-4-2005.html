Do NOT donate to theSalvation Army -- they are not a non-partisan group but a farright intolerant religious group that hates gays, pushes itsreligious beliefs on the people it provides aid to and doesn'tdeserve your money. There are plenty of great groups like theRed Cross that can use your money efficiently and without laterusing it to discriminate against Americans they disapprove ofand attack you and/or those you care about.
