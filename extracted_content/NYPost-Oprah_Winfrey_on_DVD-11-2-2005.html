DVD covers reign 
of daytime's queen 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
For Oprah Winfrey -
like so mony talented 
African Americans -
it all began in church. 
"I llsed to speak in the 
church all the time," 
confesses Winfrey in 
interviews on the new six­
DVD box set" 'The Oprah 
WInfrey Show' -'nte 20th 
Anniversary Collection" 
(Paramount; $54.99). "The 
sisters in the frunt row 
fanning themselves would 
S<ty to my gnUldmothe r, 'TIus 
child sure can talk!' " 
She's been talking ever 
since. 
The new DVD box set -
due out later th.i:; month and 
more than 17 hours long­
covers countless highlights, 
from weight· loss prograem; 
and makeovers to 1um 
emise's jmnp on the couch 
and that manic car giveaway. 
It also includes complete 
episodes -including her 
50th birthday bash and a 
trip to Africa, Not just a 
clip jub, it features Winfrey 
talking about every aspect 
ufthe show. 
Think she's too rich and 
powerful to get her 
feelings hurt? Think again. 
Winfrey decided to make 
dieting a show topic 
because "I wanted the 
people to know, 'I know 
that I'm rat It's a problem. 
You know how many diets 
I've been un?' " 
Later, in talking about 
her single most-popular 
episode -the one where 
she wheeled out 67 pounJs 
of fat and shuwed off her 
slim, new jeans -Winfrey 
admits that two days after that show, she couldn't fit 
into those jeans anymore . 
"Every single tabloid story 
has hurt me as much as it 
would hurt anybody else who 
is reading that you're fat." 
Among the revelation s: 
Winfrey once dated film 
critic Roger Ebert; couldn't 
get a single celebrity to 
appear on her first nationally 
s-yndicated episode in 1986 
(despite begging Don 
Johnsun of "Miami Vice," 
among others); admitted thilt 
during the '80s she looked 
like she was dressed by "a 
had drag queen .. 
Still, she was an 
immediate sensatiuIl -
beating industry giant Phil 
Donahue in the Chicago 
ratings on the very first day. 
On the street, evervone 
recognized her. Everyonc 4 
That didn't stop Winfrey 
from doing everything she 
could to bring in crowds. "I 
would stop at Dunkin 
Donuts in the morning­
myself -and pick up the 
donuts for the audience, " 
she says. 
But she can still hear the 
voice of her father who 
couldn't understand why 
Winfrey was unsatisfied 
working as a rv news 
reporter in Nashville, 
"Well, you're making 
$22,000 and you're 22," 
says Winfrey, imitating her 
father's gravelly voice. "I 
don't know what else you 
want in the wurld. You 
better save half your 
money because you're not 
going to make that kind of 
money forever:' 
Well, Oprah's father was 
half right.</p>
