Christine Ebersole blooms in 'Grey Gardens' BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
hen actress Christine 
Ebersole was a young girl 
growing up in Wmnetka, 
Ill., she would sneak 
off by herself to Sacred 
Heart Church during 
lunch break at school. 
"I would stop in the 
Catholic church," says 
Ebersole, who was raised a Unitarian but 
sometimes went to the church with her 
neighbors. "No one would be there and I'd 
look around and I'd start singing in Latin, 
just what 1 remembered from the Mass. It 
wasn't to show off. It was just to connect." 
Now theatergoers are headed to "Grey 
Gardens" to worship Ebersole . Adapted 
from the cult 1975 documentary by Albert 
and David Maysles, the musical, opening 
Thursday at the Walter Kerr Theater, tells 
the story of Edith "Big Edie" Beale and her 
daughter, "Little Edie" Beale, relatives of " 
Jackie 0 who fell ft am the heights of so· 
ciety to living in a crumbling, Gothic East I' 
Hampton mansion called Grey Gardens, 
surrounded by cats and raccoons and . I 
creeping memories . j' In Act I (set in 1941), Ebersole plays 
the 50-ish Dig Edie. who hopes to steal the 
limelight at her young daughter's engage­
ment party by planning a miniconcert of 
her own In Act II (set in 1973). Ebersole be-, 
comes Little Edie (with Mary Louise Wilson I 
playing the now 80-ish Big Edie), a droll, 
paranoiac woman with odd fashion sense I 
who shuffles around the tumble-down es­
tate and battles with her mother. Ebersole says that in preview perfor­
mances and in the show's previous hit Off­
Broadway incarnation, audiences fell silent 
watching Little Edie's painful vulnerability. 
"To have tbat experience is so power­
ful, because everyone's connecting to that 
part of themselves that understands [how] 
we're all the same," says Ebersole . ''We all 
identify with the humanity of that." In 1999, an agent helpfully told Ebersole 
she was over the hill. 
"Success [on 1V] depended on things 
outside my control. It depended on my Q 
rating" - a system by which a performer's 
appeal is tracked -"or my age or my 
looks. Talent didn't have to figure in. What 
made me leave L.A. -and my husband 
and I decided it together -was a faith 
The 53-year-old actress is 
clearly feeling like she has 
come in from the wilderness. 
As Ebersole, who lives in 
Maplewood , N.J_, reclines on 
a couch in her dressing room, 
she talks passionately about 
politics. delves into childhood

ter] use," she says. 
Her faith was rewarded with 
a role in Gore Vidal's "The 
Best Man." Then in 200 I. she 
won a Tony for her turn in the 
hit revival of "42nd Street." A 
year later, she was nominated 
for "Dinner at Eight."

Then she moved to Los Angeles, doing 
small roles in major films like "Tootsie" 
(1982) and "Amadeus" (\984). and, after

that didn't make it (Ted Danson's "Ink") or 
family movies thai didn't bring in families 
("Richie Rich." "My Favorite Mattian") . When "Grey Gardens" opened 
Off-Broadway earlier this year, Doug 
Wright's book, Scott Frankel's score and 
Michael Korie's lyrics all earned raves, but it 
was Ebersole who made heads spin. Its ar­
rival on Broadway has been much anticipat­
ed, thanks to her. So now instead of being 
over the hill, she has reached her peal(

says "But within the narrowing of that field
