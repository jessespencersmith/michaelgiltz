9/01/2005 02:30:00 AMThat's Rummy's infamous response to the lawlessness thatsprang up in Baghdad when Bush didn't have enough boots onthe ground. What will Bush and his cronies say now about thechaos in New Orleans?Aaron Brown of CNN described the scene as something you'dexpect to see in a Third World country. He also jumped on acomment by Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of LA who triedto tell everyone to remain calm and that everything was beingdone. The military is on the way, Landrieu said. Then sheadded rather plaintively, "Get here soon."As Aaron Brown said, The military is on the way but it's notthere yet. It's not there soon enough.Meanwhile, Bush's top staff is meeting to discuss the biggestquestion of the day -- how can they blame this on Bill Clinton?
