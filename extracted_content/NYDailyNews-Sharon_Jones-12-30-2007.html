            <p>oul singer Sharon Jones makes her movie debut
in the Denzel Washington drama "The Great De-
baters," which opened Christmas Day. But she
had to tick off Lou Reed to do it.
She was touring with Reed when he was per-
forming his classic 1973 album "Berlin," with Jones in
a backup choir that included Antony of Antony and the
Johnsons, among others.
"It was a beautiful thing," says the 5l-year-old sing-
e4 who was born in Augusta, Ga., and grew up in
Brooklyn. "Then when we got to Australia, Lou gave
me two ver-ses on "Sweet Jane" and the people went
crazy, and he almost cried, said I took him to the
mountaintop.
"I was getting ready to go away with him agaih in
June and July for a European touf, and then this movie
came through three days before I was leaving, and I let
Lou down. And oh my God was he angry."
"The Great Debaters,' which co-stars Forest Whita-
ker and is produced by Oprah Winfrey, is the second
film directed by Washington. He stars as the debat-
ing coach at all-black Wley College in Texas, which
famously competed against Harvard in 1935. Jones
plays a juke-joint singer and performs six songs on
the soundtrack, including a number of gospel funes
like "Up Above My Head" and gritty soul numbers like
"That's What My Baby Likes."
But tell that to Reed.
"I saw him in July at Prospect Park for this Doc Po-
mus tribute. When I got there, I saw Lou on the oth-ran him down and said, 'Lou, it's me, Sharon.'He said,
'I know,'and turned around and walked awayfrom
me. But me and him had bonded. I didn't do anything
to hurt him. I'm a nobody. Whywould he treat me like
that? I grabbed him and said, 'Iou, give me a hug.
Please don't walk away, Lou. I am so sorry, Lou.'
"I said, 'Lou, come on, you're talking Denzel, For-
est Whitaker and Oprah. Come on, Lou. You don't turn
down Oprah.'He finally did write me a letter. And he
understood."
So Jones survived Reed's anger and made up, like
she always has. A one-time corrections officer at Rik-
ers Island, Jones knows one thing: Never show fear.
And she has been fearless in recording gritty, old-
school soul music for tiny Daptone Records with the
fierce band the Dap Kings for more than a decade. The
work finally began to pay off with their second album,
"Naturally," which won terrific reviews.
ThenAmyWinehouse came calling. The English
pop star used the band on her breakout album, "Back
to Black," and the hit single "Rehab," giving them a
higher profile than ever. And they've capitalizsd witlh a
new album, il00 Days, 100 Nights," that's even funk-
ier. Jones herself is getting better reviews thaneve4
despite a lifetime of being told she wouldn't make it.
When success hits, she'll know how to handle it.
"These young peoplejust don't know," says Jones.
"I'm 51. I've been out here too long. Ain't no fallin'
down here. If I had money, I would definitely know
what to do with it, because I haven't had money mySinger Sharon Jones wraps
up the year in 'Great' style
