            <p>heater can be dan­
gerous. The British 
theatrical troupe 
Cheek by Jowl was 
in Moscow to stage 
a show at the Red 
Army theater, a massive space built 
for spectacles glorifying the state. 
Director Declan Donnellan and set 
designer Nick Ormerod, his artis­
tic and personal partner, were won­
dering what might be available to 
them in the free market chaos of 
the former Soviet Union. 
"We were speaking to some 
of the people working with us 
and I asked, 'Is the stage strong 
enough to bring a jeep on?' And 
they said yes. Then I asked, 
'Well, could we bring a tank on 
stage?' And they said yes, but it 
would be very expensive. Then 
they smiled and said, 'We could 
even get you a nuclear bomb.' " 
Donnellan laughs, quickly 
adding that the Russians were just jok­
ing -never a given in the Wild West 
that is Moscow today. He's relaxing 
with tea and a smoke at Method and 
Madness, a rehearsal space in London 
a stone's throw from the National. It's 
late January, and Donnellan and his 
cast have just finished a run-through of the first act of Shakespeare's Much 
Ado About Nothing, which comes to the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music's 
Majestic Theater March 25-April 5. 
For theater people, a rehearsal 
space is a safe haven, a bunker they can 
hunker down in without fear. But 
Donnellan has more reason than usual to enjoy its solitude today. Cameron 
Mackintosh has just posted a closing 
notice for Ma1tin wm7e, the less-than­
mega musical that Donnellan and 
Ormerod staged for him in the sum­
mer of 1996. Instead of spawning 
countless productions around the 
world, Ma11:in Guerre was coming to a

<p>close after a turbulent West End run. 
Donnellan's publicist suggests he won't 
be very interested in talking about the 
show's fate ("That's the past," he says), 
and indeed all the director will say 
about it is a noncommittal , "It was an 
interesting experience." 
Donnellan opens up when the sub­
ject turns to Cheek by Jowl's fresh 
approach to the classics. The company 
first won raves at BAM in 1994 for As 
You Like It, a revelatory all-male pro-duction that launched Adrian 
Lester (now featured in the Mike 
Nichols film Primary Colors) to 
stardom. "Shakespeare doesn't 
have answers; he asks wonderful 
questions," the director says. 
"The lines are a mystery. You 
never actually get to the bottom 
of it. I think it's vanity [for a 
director] to say, 'This is what I 
have to say about this play; it's 
going to be under my control.' 
We try very hard not to do that." 
The versatile Donnellan, 44, 
and Ormerod, 46, have collabo­
rated on acclaimed productions 
such as Sweeney Todd, Peer Gynt, 
and the electrifying initial London 
staging of Angels in America that 
helped ensure its worldwide 
reception. But it's Cheek by Jowl 
-founded in 1981 when the men 
decided they'd rather make a case 
for the classics than work as bar­
risters -that's remained a con­
stant. Asked about his and 
Ormerod 's working relationship, 
Donnellan says with a laugh, "We don't 
have one. He does what he does [as the 
designer], and I do what I do, which is 
talk to the actors. It's not very struc­
tured, although he sits in on rehearsals 
as much as he can." 
The pair chose to tackle the often­
performed Much Ado because, says 
Donnellan, "After The Duchess of Malfi 
[another critical success, which came 
to BAM in '95], I wanted to do some­
thing funny -
though this one . . 
IS seemrng more 
and more dark! 
It's sort of a 
COlniC version of 
Macbeth. I think 
all the 
Shakespeare 
comedies are 
about the com­
plexity of mar­
riage in its dif­
ferent forms; 
that marriages 
are important, 
but they also 
involve compro­
mise. You open 
certain doors by closing other ones. Lots of people are 
in tears at a wedding because they're 
[feeling] excluded." 
Donnellan and Ormerod set the 
play in 1900 England so that the pro­
duction could be as modern as possible 
but still bound by societal restraints. 
"We explored it in a very free way, like 
As You Like It, but we had to provide a 
very specific social context," 
Donnellan says. "That period is quite 
useful to provide a cage in which the 
passions can rattle. If you don't set up 
the conventions, you can't watch them 
being broken. We wanted to do it first 
in the Titanic period, but it was hard 
to avoid the feelings of the mass dead. 
[In every production] we put a lot of 
work into how people move in differ­
ent periods and how accents change. 
Aristocratic English is vety, very good 
for this play." 
Even Beatrice and Benedick 
(Saskia Reeves and Matthew 
MacFadyen) have been rethought . 
That sparring couple is usually seen as 
Tracy and Hepburn soulmates, verbal­
ly fencing with someone they secretly 
admire. But Donnellan zeroes in on 
the seemingly harmless trap set for 
them by the others in the play. 
"I think they playa very cruel trick 
on Beatrice and Benedick, telling each 
that the other professed their love 
when they hadn't. It may be one of the 
cruelest things one can do. It's actual­
ly probably worse than saying some­
one hates you. People want to control 
love, and they think they can turn it 
on very cheaply. What they forget 
about love is that it's out of control 
and you have to obey it. We can block 
it, bury it, but we can't control it." 
At Donnellan and Ormerod's 
behest, Cheek by Jowl's productions 
are actor-driven . "Performances 
change from place to place," the direc­
tor explains. "Audiences affect things 
when they see them, so it's important 
for me that a production is not seen as 
'finished.' We want to take the pres­
sure off actors and not make them feel 
that they're producing a finished arti­
cle. It's always a work in progress." •
