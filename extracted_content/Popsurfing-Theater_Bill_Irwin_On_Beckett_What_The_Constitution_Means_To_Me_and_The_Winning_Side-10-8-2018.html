IRISH  REPERTORY  THEATRE
Let's make one thing clear: this is not a play. Actor and clown Bill
Irwin is giving a lecture, a talk or if it sounds less threatening a
discussion of playwright Samuel Beckett. It's true Irwin deliversexcerpts of pieces by Beckett and even clowns around a bit, but this isvery much not an evening of theater. It's subtitled "exploring the
works of Samuel Beckett" and that's just about right. I emphasize this
because I spent about half of this event recalibrating what I wasseeing. I'm sure audiences who are wise enough to attend will enjoy ita whole lot more if they know precisely what to expect.
When did lectures go out of fashion? At the turn of the 20th century,
going to a lecture or talk or public speech was quite the thing.Obviously radio and TV and even the wide availability of books madethat less necessary. And yes you can still go see lectures and talks butusually you'll be in a college setting or catch someone plugging a book.
Outside of David Sedaris tours, the idea of going to see a public figure
weigh in on a topic has faded from view.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>What a pity since hearing Bill Irwin share his thoughts on Beckett is
fascinating and enlightening. He charmingly introduces the event andperforms selections from eight different works, all the while sharinghis thoughts on Beckett's voice, the experience of acting in his plays
(often, Irwin says, actors will finish a run and insist they were terrible
and immediately wonder when they can do it again), the debate onhow to pronounce "Godot," the mind-twisting fact that this most Irishof writers wrote his work in French (!), the art of clowning, thepleasure of baggy pants, Beckett's early and powerful exposure to
vaudeville and again and again the delightful puzzle of why and how
this work speaks so forcefully to Irwin. One answer he gives? No, hedoesn't love despair; he loves characters who face up to despair andsoldier on as best they can.
Then I thought I spotted the sly, savvy actor in Irwin, despite his
charming, self-effacing aura. Young actor Finn O'Sullivan joins Irwinvery briefly when doing a scene from "Godot" that features amessenger boy. After it ended, Irwin brought O'Sullivan back out for a
quick bow and joshes with him before sending the lad on his way. Ahh,
I thought. Smart! O'Sullivan rightly gets his moment in the spotlight,doesn't have to wait around for the final bow...and at the end of theshow Irwin will have the applause all to himself. But, no. At the end ofthe evening O'Sullivan comes back out and they take their bows
together. That makes Irwin's earlier gesture all the more generous.
Maybe that self-effacement wasn't an act after all.
Irwin's performances are sharp and entertaining here, such as when he
demonstrates various ways one can tackle a certain bit or admits
trying to set Beckett's dialogue to some new internal rhythm like rap
or a waltz. (It just doesn't work.) His insights are many and thesharing of an actor's process (or at least this particular actor's process)is a treat. With just a spare stage, a few props and spot-on lighting(courtesy Michael Gottlieb), this master class in acting and Beckett is a
treat. It's the best lecture in town!

<p>What a frustrating and unsatisfying bit of theater this proved for me,
in an interesting way. It's a pity since the conceit and the politics and
the painfully timely nature of a show looking at our Constitution and
our government -- well, it's all catnip to me. Writer and star Heidi
Schreck spent her childhood going from VFW hall to VFW halldebating other kids and winning scholarship money for college.Indeed, she paid her way through school on the winnings. But what
would her present-day self think of the Constitution compared to her
admittedly smart but still much younger and perhaps less cynical 15year old version?
And so we get What  The  Constitution  Means  To  Me,  with Schreck in
the heightened VFW hall of her dreams (the sets are by Rachel
Hauck), delivering the debate speech she gave so many years ago butwith the interruptions and asides she couldn't say at the time, alongwith the hard-won wisdom and a more nuanced sense of historySchreck has gathered since then.
It's all very meta. Schreck is playing her younger self, though as she
explains she won't be "playing" a 15 year old as such. (Though shedoes amusingly speed up her delivery as time runs out or feel sweetlyearnest at times, all of which reads "teen debater.") But then Schreckveers off and isn't delivering that long-ago speech. She's talking about
her private life, the violence her mother witnessed as a child, the
violence her grandmother endured, the abortion Schreck couldn'tbring herself to tell her mom about at the time, the statistics onviolence against women in this country and much more. Sometimesshe's just a more informed debater; sometimes she's left the debate far
behind and tears up at the memory of the degradation women in her
family's history have faced or even how she had sex with a guy shereally didn't want to because -- as she jokes -- it seemed the politething to do. Then she returns to that moment and clarifies that some
inner voice told her not to die, to be scared for her life and do what
she must to survive.
It's all emotional and sincere and briefly harrowing and often funny.It's also completely artificial. I might blame Schreck's performance butI don't think there's anything particularly wrong with it. I didn't buy it,
but I didn't mind it. It's the very structure and conceit of What  The
Constitution  Means  To  Me  that just doesn't work. We know Schreck is</p>
<p>"recreating" a moment from her younger self's life. So when she
"impulsively" changes tack and starts sharing info from her currentpoint of view, we know this is scripted. And while it feels unfair of meto say this, even her emotional moments feel scripted. Does she really
wipe away tears thinking about her grandmother? Or is that simply a
beat in the script? Frankly, I didn't even know if everything she saidabout her family was actually true.
And that's what proves so frustrating about this work of theater. I
didn't want to doubt or wonder the truth of any of it. On one level, itshouldn't matter. On another level, if it worked I wouldn't care. But itdidn't work and I was annoyed that I found myself wondering
precisely what was true. At the end of the evening, a young female
debater comes on stage and they tackle an issue and an audiencemember chooses a winner...and even THAT felt scripted andunconvincing. I assume every word of this confessional night isaccurate. I certainly agree with the essential ideas she presented -- one
of the most essential being that perhaps the Constitution was not
created to slowly spread equal rights to all but simply to create afunctioning society in which only the men who created it would enjoythe most power.
If Schreck had just come out and said, "Here's the speech I would give
today at the VFW" and told her story, it might have been less dramatic
but it would have been more effective.  
What  The  Constitution  Means
To  Me  is heartfelt and sincere and I agreed with most everything it
espouses. But as theater? I didn't believe it for a minute.
THE  WINNING  SIDE  * out of ****
EPIC  THEATRE  ENSEMBLE  AT THEATRE  ROW
The life of German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun is filled with
moral complexity. He helped design the V-2 rockets that terrorizedLondon during WW II. But then he also helped the US launch a rocketto the moon, inspiring not just Americans but truly the entire world.The bizarre reality of his journey is almost hard to grasp. Did he really
go from a Nazi to a celebrated figure on Walt Disney's TV show in the
1950s, just one decade after the end of the war? A black satire, apenetrating drama -- the possibilities of how to tell his story areendless.
The  Winning  Side  captures none of this in a flat, un-involving play
that skims over the surface of von Braun's questionable life, saving any
attempt to hold his feet to the fire for a confusing, haphazard final fewminutes. Indeed, this play by James Wallert jumps back and forth in
time in a confusing fashion, as if Wallert himself isn't sure where to
start. Mostly it toggles back and forth from post-war America to Nazi-occupied Paris, where von Braun (Sullivan Jones) is wooing andperhaps falling in love with French actress Margot Moreau (played by</p>
<p>Melissa Friedman). Also in the mix are Godfrey L. Simmons Jr. as von
Braun's military contact and Devin E. Haqq as a about a dozen other
characters.
In any case, von Braun woos Moreau and she resists. After all, he's a
Nazi! If anything, the play very modestly does a better job of showing
her moral dilemma than his. But even here it falls short since we areleft to imagine she might be asking von Braun pointed questions andpeeking into his briefcase for the Resistance. It seems she wasn't, but
the possibility is so strong they should have cleared up that potential
path to redemption early on. Even worse, we never quite learn the fateof Moreau when just a little bit of stage business would have cleared itup. Late in the play von Braun is in the US after being forced to leaveher behind. (Forced? One never knows with von Braun.) She sends a
note pleading for help and he...carefully puts the letter away. Does he
do something later? Apparently not but having von Braun tear it upwould have made that point clear. It would have also painted him as avillain and the show doesn't want to point fingers too easily.  
But are they worried we might not like him or that we might? Wernheris put through the wringer only at the end. It's done so hurriedly I'mnot sure most theater-goers will follow it. But for some reason I wasalready aware that von Braun oversaw a factory in which thousands
suffered as slave labor, many of them tortured or killed. It was
probably impossible for von Braun to not be aware of these atrocities.Yet that barely comes across here.
Long ago I realized how wrong it is to judge actors trapped in a bad
play. Nonetheless, the cast sport some outrageous accents, includingFrench and German and British. By the end, I wasn't even sure abouttheir American voices. Sullivan Jones is certainly an appealingpresence but the material doesn't even begin to allow him a chance to
present a complex character. Most technical elements are ok though I
did especially appreciate scenic designer Chika Shimizu's choice ofplacing a giant fan embedded in the top of the set so it could blow outair at the audience during key moments, like a rocket launch. (Itreminded me of a ride at Disney World, ironically enough.)
A brief final stab at moral finger-wagging takes place -- but at the
audience. Don't be so quick to judge von Braun, says the play. Insteadof listing the many positives that came out of the space program, for</p>
<p>example, it say, Hey, the pyramids were made with enforced labor and
many people died. No one is calling for them to be torn down, are
they? Well, no, but this is a rather weak tangent of an argument tomake.
In contrast, act two opens with a short ditty by songwriter and satirist
Tom Lehrer. It lasts maybe two minutes but in that brief time Lehrerdoes more to illuminate and skewer the pliable ethics of von Braunthan the rest of the play combined. If they were afraid the show might
have us tut-tutting at von Braun, they needn't have worried.  The
Winning  Side  barely lays a glove on him.   Werner von Braun wins.
Again.
