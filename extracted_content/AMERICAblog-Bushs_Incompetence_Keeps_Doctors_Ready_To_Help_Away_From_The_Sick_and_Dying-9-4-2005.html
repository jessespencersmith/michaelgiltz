9/05/2005 01:28:00 AMWe've been deluged in the past day with stories of militaryships sitting off the coast with beds and food and water andmedical supplies, stories of cities and states around the countrythat tried to help but were rejected or delayed by Bush, storiesof volunteers with vital skills being told to stay away. I praysome major media outlet does a breakdown SOON of all thesemiscues directly attributable to Bush and his bureaucrats. (AndI don't care if the governor of Louisiana is tripped up too; Bushis working so hard to paint her the villain, I tend to resist, butthere's no reason to think she didn't screw up too.)Here's the latest absurdity: hundreds of doctors andparamedics ready to help and being kept away by a sea of redtape.Among the doctors stymied from helping out are 100surgeons and paramedics in a state-of-the-art mobilehospital, developed with millions of tax dollars for just suchemergencies, marooned in rural Mississippi."The bell was rung, the e-mails were sent off. ...We all gotoff work and deployed," said one of the frustratedsurgeons, Dr. Preston "Chip" Rich of the University of NorthCarolina at Chapel Hill."We have tried so hard to do the right thing. It took us 30hours to get here," he said. That government officialscan't straighten out the mess and get them assignedto a relief effort now that they're just a few milesaway "is just mind-boggling," he said.Eight days in and the incompetence and misery is still staggering.
