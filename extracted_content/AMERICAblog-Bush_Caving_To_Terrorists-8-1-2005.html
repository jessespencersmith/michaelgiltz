8/01/2005 10:08:00 PMBush is insisting Iraqis finish their constitution in two weeks --even if they need more time -- because he has to start pullingout troops before mid-term elections. To hell with what is bestfor the long-term stability of Iraq (probably an INFLUX oftroops into Iraq, frankly), he's got polling numbers to look outfor.And now the new US ambassador to Iraq is continuing to setdeadlines for troop withdrawals -- meeting with the Iraqis todiscuss what cities the soldiers will pull out of and when nextspring. Bush can't possibly pretend things have gotten BETTERor even stabilized in the past year, and yet he's talking aboutpulling out and saying when. According to Bush, that means allthe insurgents have to do is hunker down and wait them out.Why does Bush love the terrorists?
