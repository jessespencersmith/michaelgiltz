            <p>F R I D AY,  J U LY  2 5 ,  2 0 0 8"X-Files" -- The Buzzless Movie Of The SummerThat's the tag one friend of mine gave to the film months ago. Nowkeep in mind, I was a huge fan of the show -- even though it got soconvoluted and crazy that I stopped watching, especially after Mulderleft. But it took nine years to do what Lost did in half a season and forthe first five years The X-Files was a top-notch drama and is easily oneof the best sci-fi shows of all time. (Not a very long list.) And so on tothe weekend box office. I have no access to tracking numbers butaudiences seemed utterly indifferent to the new X-Files movie. Andnow suddenly it's opening on the second weekend of one of the biggeststeamrollig box office hits of all time. The Dark Knight is going to gross$100 million in its second weekend, almost unthinkably given howhuge it opened last weekend and a feat no film as has ever done. But nofilm as ever grossed $78 million in four days (Mon-Thur) onnonholiday. That's right, practically $80 mil during the week. EveryoneI know has seen the film, has purchased tickets for the film, wants topurchase tickets for the film, wants to see it in IMAX or simply wants tosee it again. My mother probably won't see it (she's in her 70s) but sheasked me if she should. I think it's almost a given after these weekdaytotals that The dark Knight will become only the second film in historyto gross more than $500 million. (Titanic grossed $600 mil. and StarWars grossed $460 million over several reissues.) It might even beatTitanic. We'll know better next Tuesday or Wednesday, but at themoment I wouldn't be surprised if it demolished that record. Demandfor this film isn't even close to being met. All of which is to say, that thereliable Box Office Prophets is crazy when it suggests that The X-Filesmovie will gross $45 million. No one cared about it before, the reviewsare middling and all anyone wants to see is The Dark Knight. Thatestimate is way, way too high. Thanks for letting me get that off mychest. Now if I'm wrong at least I'm on the record and can take theblame.NOTE: OK, The Dark Knight grossed $23 millon on Friday, so another$100 million weekend is out of the question. But if it grosses $75million, that's a 50% drop which is very minimal for a massive movielike this. And at least I was right about The X-Files. It grossed $4million on Friday, so a weekend of $14 million is likely, as opposed tothe ludicrous $45 million predicted by Box Office Prophets.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
