6/24/2005 06:00:00 PMNOTE: On Fridays and down times, we are considering postreviews and previews of books, and the like that should be ofinterest to politically minded bloggers. Hey, we're reading themanyway -- might as well let you know what we think. Tell us ifyou think it's appropriate. Coming next week: "1776" by DavidMcCullough.""THE SURVIVOR: BILL CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE"By John F. Harris($29.95; Random House)While the muckraking book on Hillary is getting trashed (evenby the New York Post), this look at Clinton's run for thePresidency and White House years has vaulted onto the charts.Harris, a reporter for the Washington Post, happily doesn'thave an ax to grind or a career to burnish. He's not trying topraise Clinton or denounce him. Harris just lays out as factuallyas possible the eight years that Clinton served the country, thepeople he worked with and the personal traits -- conciliation,empathy, delaying tough decisions -- that served Clinton sowell in so many ways but doomed him on the Paula Jonesscandal.Some unexpected heroes emerge here (including LloydBentsen, who Harris says Clinton curried favor with and wasrather in awe of) as well as some who come of more poorlythan in the past (including, perhaps, George Stephanopoulos).And Harris reminds us that we can blame Newt Gingrich in partfor Monica Lewinsky (it was Gingrich's ploy of shutting downthe government that led to a skeleton White House staff andthus the conditions for their first liaison).As you'd expect from a reporter, the style is no-nonsense andstraightforward. It all comes in a rush -- Gore's contributionsand political caution, Hillary's loyalty and brash sense ofpurpose, the Karl Rove-ian figure of Dick Morris, and theconstant polling that both allowed Clinton to pursue the policieshe believed in and led Clinton to policies he hadn't considered.Perhaps the book's signal achievement is the overwhelmingsense of crisis after crisis and issue after issue that threatensto swamp even the most capable president. As welfare reformand Bosnia and Haitian refugees and midterm elections and therealignment of NATO and Boris Yeltsin's drunkenness and othertopics demand attention and affect each other in unexpectedways, you begin to appreciate the awesome responsibility ofthe Presidency.Harris hasn't written the definitive account of Clinton and thoseyears -- it will take decades, not to mention the release ofclassified documents and private papers and public memoirsbefore someone can have enough of the facts to do that. Butthis sober book is compelling and blessedly free ofpartisanship. When Clinton returns to center stage (As thehead of the UN? As the President's spouse?), anyone lookingfor perspective on his personality and presidency would do well
