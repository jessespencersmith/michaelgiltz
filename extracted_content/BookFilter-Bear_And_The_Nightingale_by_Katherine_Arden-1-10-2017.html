Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: A magical debut novel for readers of  Naomi
Novik’s  Uprooted , Erin Morgenstern’s  The Night Circus , and Neil Gaiman’s
myth-rich fantasies, The Bear and the Nightingale  spins an irresistible
spell as it announces the arrival of a singular talent with a gorgeous voice.
At the edge of the Russian wilderness, winter lasts most of the year andthe snowdrifts grow taller than houses. But Vasilisa doesn’t mind—she
spends the winter nights huddled around the embers of a fire with her
beloved siblings, listening to her nurse’s fairy tales. Above all, she lovesthe chilling story of Frost, the blue-eyed winter demon, who appears inthe frigid night to claim unwary souls. Wise Russians fear him, her nursesays, and honor the spirits of house and yard and forest that protect their
homes from evil. After Vasilisa’s mother dies, her father…

What We Say
Sometimes, when you start a new book by a new author and it begins really well, you hold in the excitement. Often a good
idea can be quickly spoiled by an author rushing too fast or going too slow or getting lost in the woods of a complicatedplot. A good idea is hard -- bringing it to fruition is much harder. But you keep reading and it gets even better and yet you
still rein in the excitement. A new talent can be like a skittish colt and you don't want to startle it away with some sudden
movement. Then you get to the end and exhale with relief: she did it. That's my reaction to "The Bear And TheNightingale," a marvelous tale by Katherine Arden. Comparisons to Naomi Novik's instant classic "Uprooted" are natural. ThatShare This Book

<p>book was inspired by Polish folk tales while this one is immersed in similar Russian myths and legends. They both feature
young heroines of bold spirit. But where "Uprooted" was a full-on fantasy from the start, "The Bear And The Nightingale" is
anchored firmly in the Russia of long ago, real and solid and earthy. Slowly the shadows come in, from the usually friendly
spirits who guard homes to the more mercurial creatures found in rivers and woods. Vasya is a child born of her mother'swill. Her grandmother was whispered about as a strange person (never a safe designation in villages of old) but her motherdid not have the gift to the same degree. That second sight is bestowed on Vasya, who does indeed see the creatures thathide amidst the warmth of the stove or huddle in the stables and befriend the horses. She treats them with respect as of
old and they honor her back, teaching Vasya to swim like a fish and ride on a horse like they are one. The more she comes
into her own as a child and young woman, the more the villagers begin to fear her. It's a simple story, involving a step-mother who also sees "demons" but fears them to the point of madness and a monk who can paint brilliant icons but isdrawn to Vasya and the vanity that lets him hear voices in the shadows and pretend it's the voice of God. Threats arise fromdeep in the woods with hard winter coming on hard winter while villagers abandon the old ways and pay the price. Arden's
story is deeply engaging, with no real villains in sight -- characters sometimes do dreadful things but they are flawed people
who make mistakes or creatures simply following their own cruel nature. Legends come to life, bravery amidst fear, hard-won victories that feel like defeat -- "The Bear And The Nightingale" has it all. It's only January but there is no doubt thisone will be remembered at the end of the year and for a long time to come. -- Michael Giltz
