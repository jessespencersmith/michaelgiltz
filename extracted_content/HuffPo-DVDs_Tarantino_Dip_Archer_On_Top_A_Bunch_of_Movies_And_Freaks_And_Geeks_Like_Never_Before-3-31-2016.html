DVDs: Tarantino's Dip, 'Archer' On Top, A Bunch of
Movies And 'Freaks And Geeks' Like Never Before
03/31/2016 02:38 am ET  | Updated  Mar 31, 2017
A new western and a forgotten western series that endured almost as long as Gunsmoke , two shamefully
ignored TV shows, a film classic from Taiwan and a film curio from the 1970s, some arty fare, some movies
that hit and some that missed...and one of the greatest TV shows of all time like you've never seen it before!Yes, it's a typical week in the new release section for BluRays and DVDs. Here we go!
DVDs: Tarantino's Dip, 'Archer' On Top, A Bunch of Movies And 'Freaks And Geeks' Like Nev  </p>
<p>THE HATEFUL EIGHT  ($39.99 BluRay; Weinstein Company)
DEATH VALLEY DAYS: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON  ($24.98 DVD; Timeless Media Group)
Quentin Tarantino's latest film has to be considered something of a disappointment, simply because it isn't
great. A perfectly good, violent, out-there Western is fun (they just don't make Westerns anymore and theyNEVER made 'em like this). But Django Unchained  and especially Inglorious Basterds  displayed a new level of
maturity and formal restraint. Oh, they were Tarantino-esque, but they also harkened back to classicHollywood style. Whereas The Hateful Eight  feels like it could have been made at any stage of his career. The
set-up is simple: a bounty hunter has a violent woman in his custody and finds himself trapped for a few daysin a cabin with a motley group of people. Some want to free her, some want to claim her so they can get thereward and some just wanna stay out of the damn storm and be left alone. Words fly a lot more than bullets,but not to worry. The bullets fly too. The cinematography is gorgeous and there's something crazily wonderfulthat this film set almost entirely in a one room cabin has a super widescreen aspect ratio. That's Tarantino foryou. It's violent, it's funny, and the cast is a hoot. But he's raised the bar emotionally and aesthetically and thatmakes The Hateful Eight  feel more like a goof or a diversion, a step backwards rather than the latest step
forward from a newly mature artist. Turning it into a stage play seems like a nutty, uninteresting idea. But hismovies are never uninteresting and fans will enjoy this.
Still, he had me at "western." We just don't get enough of them anymore. And anyone complaining about the
endless wave of super hero movies should remind themselves what pop culture was like in the 1950s and1960s. Dear God, it was westerns, westerns, westerns morning noon and night. Westerns at the movies, both</p>
<p>features, B flicks and serials. Westerns on the radio. And TV! Westerns dominated so much it seemed like
westerns were all they knew how to do. Case in point: Death Valley Days.  This anthology series (with every
episode based on "real" events) aired on the radio from 1930 to 1945. Then it aired on TV for 18 years oforiginals from 1952 to 1970, which gives the venerable Gunsmoke  a run for its money. I usually complain when
old shows release single season sets. Fans of Gilligan's Island  don't want one season; they want the whole
series so why split them up? In this case, since they made more than 450 episodes, well, I understand. Thelongest-running host was Stanley Andrews, you'll spot all sorts of stars in guest roles and it's syndicated sothe budget is somewhat smaller than network TV. This set has all 18 episodes of season one. There were aLOT more to go.</p>
<p>ARCHER SEASON SIX  ($29.98 DVD; 20th Century Fox)
TURN: WASHINGTON'S SPIES SEASON 2  ($49.98 DVD; Anchor Bay)
Here are two of the less appreciated shows on TV. Heck there are so many good shows on TV it would be
amazing if some great shows weren't overlooked. But why Archer  is overlooked by the Emmys and most
viewers escapes me. It isn't the best voice cast on TV; it's the best comedy ensemble on TV, period. It lost alittle gas but season six righted the ship and season seven (which is just beginning) looks set to spin theseries off in an entirely new direction. The James Bond/workplace comedy setting remains ripe for humor,especially when they downplay making minor characters insanely weird. The more real they are, the funnier itis. And funny is precisely what Archer  remains, thanks to good writing, a perverse imagination and those
terrific actors.
Turn is the complicated look at the American Revolution, an era that remains puzzlingly resistant to
dramatizing in movies and TV, by and large. ( 1776  and Hamilton  being obvious theatrical exceptions.) Here
they zero in on spies who live with British patriots but are working for George Washington. Jamie Bell is a
marvelous actor but there was no disputing season one got off to a very slow, murky start. Season twonotably improved in pacing and impact, for the few critics that still paid attention. It's coming back for seasonthree on April 25 on AMC and bless that network for being patient with shows that others would haveabandoned by now. (I'm looking at you, Starz.) Like HBO, they know a passionate fanbase needn't be big tomake a show important for a network. This is only on DVD for the moment though I assume like Season 1 itwould eventually be available on BluRay. So buyer beware.</p>
<p>A BRIGHTER SUMMER DAY  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) 
A POEM IS A NAKED PERSON  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion)</p>
<p>Edward Yang's A Brighter Summer Day  looms larger with every passing year. I had an almost spiritual
connection when first seeing his lovely Yi YI  but this is his masterpiece and a major film in Taiwanese
cinematic history. The 1991 film is four hours long, sprawling (obviously), hypnotically compelling and a must-
see for any film buff. It's so specifically Taiwanese that comparisons are misleading, but Rebel Without ACause  or other youth films are a natural touchstone....until the film pivots into more familial concerns, making
it one of the quietest epics you'll ever see and one that transcends juvenile delinquency to embrace theeternal angst of adolescence. It's beautifully restored to the original 237 minute running time and the extrasare bounteous: a new interview with star Chen Chang, a two hour documentary about New Taiwan Cinema, anew commentary track and even a videotaped performance of a 1992 play by Yang.
More problematic is Les Blank's A Poem Is A Naked Person.  This long lost documentary about singer Leon
Russell has been tantalizingly out of reach for many years. Here it finally is, a shaggy time capsule of early
1970s when the rock and roll stars of the day were filmmakers...and rock and roll stars. Russell would mostlyremain a cult item but for a brief period he was a huge star and somehow Blank tagged along to film hisworld. We get amazing glimpses of Russell in concert, some footage of other people in concert and lots andlots of 1970s flavor, ranging from celebrities to hangers-on to, well, pretty much anything that crossed Blank'spath since Russell was clearly so loathe to cooperate in any way. Russell is so good you can't help yelling atBlank, get out of the way and just show him performing! I'll need another viewing or two before I canappreciate and judge the film he made rather than the film I wanted. Like the Rolling Stones' CocksuckerBlues,  it's probably more fascinating to wonder about than actually watch. But boy does it capture an era.</p>
<p>HUMANS SEASON 1  ($39.99 BluRay; Acorn Media)
FEAR THE WALKING DEAD SEASON 1 SPECIAL EDITION  ($59.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay)
Sure, horror endures because people like to be scared. And sci-fi endures because people will always wonder
what comes next. (Rising oceans, apparently.) But the horror and the sci-fi that's made transcends thosepassing concerns because these genres are so good at helping us see the present with fresh eyes. Humans  is
an interesting UK series about a near-future where "synths" (robot slaves that are confusingly akin to humans)are omni-present. Naturally, it raises explicit issues about what makes us human. But ethical debates don'tcompel so much as a family dealing with the stress of a new member, even if that new member has to beplugged in. It'll be around for a while. Season One was Channel 4's highest rated drama in more than 20years.
The Walking Dead  began as pure entertainment. But you keep returning because of the tension at its heart:
you'll do anything to survive but is it worth surviving if you have to abandon every shred of decency and
humanity you once took for granted? The spin-off Fear The Walking Dead  was determined to be different and
boy did they succeed. Instead of horrific action, we got...tension, slow-building tension. And atmosphere. Ithasn't really added up to anything yet and season two is set on a boat, which feels very much like the prisongambit of The Walking Dead.  but we'll see. This is a special edition and I'd be hard-pressed to say the bonus
scenes that didn't air are worth forking over for, especially at the rather pricey cost of this eight episode set.</p>
<p>DADDY'S HOME  ($39.99 BluRay; Paramount)
CONCUSSION  ($34.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures)
POINT BREAK  ($35.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.)
THE HUNGER GAMES: COMPLETE 4 FILM COLLECTION  ($64.97 BluRay; Lionsgate)</p>
<p>Four not very good films, but two of them are hits! Because what do I know. I love the premise of Daddy's
Home,  a comedy about a step-dad (Will Ferrell) who has to compete with a much cooler dad (Mark Wahlberg)
who gets to have all the fun with the kids and never clean up the mess if things go wrong. It's such a relatablepremise (and fun to see Wahlberg playing against his nice guy persona) that it's a pity the movie is so trite.Still, those two have great chemistry.
Will Smith usually has great instincts with his more serious dramas. ( The Pursuit Of Happyness  remains a
favorite of mine from his career.) Yet this tale of a forensic pathologist going up against the NFL is so noble
that Smith echoes the tiresome earnestness of Sidney Poitier at his worst. However, the fake controversy thatthe film Concussion  soft-pedaled the NFL's cover-up ended once the movie was actually seen. (That was the
entire point of the film, after all.) And the NFL continues to cave as the facts emerge more clearly every dayabout what it knew and when.
Like Daddy's Home,  Point Break  has nothing on its mind but to entertain. That's not true. It also had in mind
the idea of launching a franchise. The original action heist movie starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze is
not a good film, precisely, but it's so loopy with the unexpected philosophical musings amidst the rad stuntsthat it has a certain offbeat charm. Not so the remake which feels mechanical and obvious, dumpingeverything that made the original a cult favorite (of sorts) and sticking to X-Games like stunts. Why,Hollywood, why? Not "why would you ruin Point Break?" But why would you even BOTHER to remake PointBreak,  a weird, one-off, not very good but somehow amusingly compelling oddity (sort of) that was clearly so
sui generis you didn't even try?
Point Break  couldn't start a franchise but The Hunger Games  sure knew how to end one. Let's be clear: the
controversial and artistically unsatisfying decision to split the final book in a trilogy into two films worked on a
pure box office level. They made more money turning one film into two than they would have if they'd onlymade one. But it made the last two films pretty joyless affairs and left a bad taste in the mouth for fans. Thisboxed set contains all four films but all it will do is remind them how the OK first film proved to be the peak.The second film was so-so, but you thought, well it's the second film. The finale will have more punch. Only tofind out the finale would be dragged out ad infinitum. They might have made a little less money but if the lasttwo movies had been rolled into one movie and it had actually been decent, everyone would have beenhappier. Then the rather insane idea of a theme park attraction based on The Hunger Games  might actually
appeal. And the less insane idea of a prequel trilogy showing how the Hunger Games began would also bewelcome. As it is, the entire franchise is tainted by the way the movies crawled to the finish line. And for whatit's worth, OBVIOUSLY Team Peeta is the right team to be on.</p>
<p>CHANTAL AKERMAN: FOUR FILMS  ($49.98 DVD; Icarus Films)
DREAMS REWIRED  ($29.98 DVD; Icarus Films)</p>
<p>The death of artist Chantal Akerman at 65 (due to depression leading to suicide) is a terrible blow to cinema.
Her masterpiece Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles  is simply one of the greatest films of
all time. Calling it a great "feminist film" is an insult to a work so important and influential, just as Akermanherself rejected labels and refused to have any of her movies shown at gay film festivals. You simply muststart with Jeanne Dielman.  But she has much more to her credit, including a string of provocative
documentaries. In the four films included in this set, Akerman compellingly examines Eastern Europe after thefall of the Berlin Wall, the brutal murder of James Byrd Jr. in Texas, illegal immigration and -- most satisfyingly-- herself, by making a film from the perspective of her apartment in Tel Aviv while she muses on this and that.A bonus disc features an hour long interview with Akerman about her body of work.
If they met, I'm certain Akerman and actress Tilda Swinton would have got on like gangbusters. Swinton is
similarly iconoclastic and always pushing boundaries. Here she is the narrator of an offbeat essay that usesfound footage from old movies and documentaries and the like to muse on technology, the loss of privacy, ourdreams and more. Swinton is the ideal coolly intelligent presence to make this work and the film has a certainDecasia -like power to conjure dreams of its own. If only for its weird uniqueness, I'm sure Akerman would
have loved it.
FREAKS AND GEEKS: THE COMPLETE SERIES ON BLURAY  ($119; Shout! Factory)
I haven't had a chance to re-watch all 18 episodes of this series yet. But 16 years after it went off the air in2000, Freaks And Geeks  looms large. It has one of the all-time great casts (Alison Jones, kudos!) and the
murderer's row talent behind the scenes is just as impressive. It's blessed with an arc that makes those all-too-few 18 episodes play beautifully, as if the show was meant to end in precisely that way from the start. Is itthe greatest drama of all time? It's certainly i the running with The Wire  and Upstairs Downstairs  and whatever</p>
<p>other shows you'd consider with a fighting chance for the crown. This set duplicates the deluxe editions
available before on BluRay. The main upgrade is picture quality and it's notable and welcome. The mostintriguing addition is a widescreen option since the show was shot on film and they suddenly realized therewas more image. I really can't decide yet how I feel about that since obviously the show was shot with theintention of framing it in the boxy way we know. It would take side by side comparisons and substantialviewing to see how the new widescreen look impacts the comedy and drama of the series. My instinct is thatit's fun to see but the original aspect ratio is preferred; still, no harm no foul. Yes, this set is very expensive. Iwish it were so cheap that every home in America had a copy. But it barely made it on the air, barely made itonto DVD, barely kept the music cues so essential to the drama and barely got the deluxe edition it deserved.So quality-wise, it's a bargain. Should you binge-watch it this weekend? Sure. But you'd be better offwatching one episode a week (or at least with a few days break in between). Its bittersweet joy is bestappreciated over time. Save your binging for the junk food.
