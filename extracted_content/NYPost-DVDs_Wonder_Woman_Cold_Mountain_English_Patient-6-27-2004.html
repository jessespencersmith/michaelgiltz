?: Wonder Woman: Complete First Season * * 
~ Warner Bros., $39.98 
A campy delight, "Wonder Woman" sets the tone right away with 
its theme song: "In her satin tights, fighting for her rights, and the 
old Red, White and Blue!" The pilot and 13 episodes are true to the 
comic books (down to the World War II setting) and Lynda Carter 
was perfect casting -she's wholesome and sexy at the same time. 
Extras include Carter's commentary and a documentary. 
Cold Mountain / 
The English Patient 
**/*** Miramax, $29.99 each 
Both of these sweeping epic 
films use war as a setting for 
romantic tales ("Cold 
Mountain" takes place during 
the Civil War, "English" during 
World War I1). And the best 
element of both is their music. 
Gabriel Yared composed both 
scores, with a delicate but 
stirring approach for "English 
Patient" and a more spare style 
for "Mountain." But the best 
"Cold Mountain" music comes 
from the songs overseen by T­
Bone Burnett and featuring 
cast member Jack White and 
bluegrass star Alison Krauss. 
Among the extras: a 90-minute 
concert film/staged reading. 
South Park: Complete 
Fourth Season **1/, 
Paramount, $49.99 
It never has the 
sustained 
brilliance of 
"The 
Simpsons," but 
every episode 
of 'South Park" 
is guaranteed 
to have something truly 
offensive and truly funny (often 
at the same time). This season 
they introduce Timmy, tackle 
attention-deficit disorder and 
make Cartman a member of NAMBLA. The minimal extras 
include brief comments from 
creators Trey Parker and Matt 
Stone. 
Blazing Saddles: 
30th Anniversary 
*** Warner Bros., $19.97 
Both this Western spoof and the 
brilliant "Young Frankenstein" 
came out in 1974, making this 
the peak year for Mel Brooks. 
"Blazing" is cruder and not as 
funny, but it's the template for 
every send-up that followed -
lots of jokes, the more obvious 
the better. Plus you can't go 
wrong with Madeline Kahn. 
Extras include commentary by 
Brooks and the pilot episode 
from the proposed TV spinoff 
"Black Bart." 
The Times 
of Harvey Milk 
***'/' New Yorker, $29.95 
This documentary about the 
assassinated California 
politician Harvey Milk gets a 
20th anniversary edition 
stuffed with three hours of 
extras. Other titles worth 
checking out this week include 
reality show "Boy Meets Boy: 
Season One" (Bravo, $39.95) 
and Ang Lee's breakthrough hit 
"The Wedding Banquet" 
(MGM, $14.95).</p>
