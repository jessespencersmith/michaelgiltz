Another slightly off kilter show from Idol. We saw about 10 people or duos make full blown
auditions and only three times did they hear "You're going to Hollywood." And in a truly bizarre bit
of editing, we saw three "yes's" in a row followed by five "no's" to end the night. When it comes topacing, that's pretty poor planning. The Idol  producers are focused on telling stories this season.
Great. But since we saw plenty of people getting the exciting news in montages, we can't helpwondering why we didn't get to see more potentially good acts. They've forgotten the main purposeof the show: not to tell a story, but to find a great singer. People watch the auditions looking forsomeone that blows them away, someone they can "discover" along with the judges and feel likethat person has a shot at the final 12 or winning it all. Last night we only saw four people(including two siblings) go through and frankly none of them was instantly thrilling. Sure, thejudges have bad days like that, but with the magic of editing, we shouldn't.
Raysharde Henderson -- the guy with the big Afro. He set the stage for the night by bringing a
lot of volume if not a lot of skill. Apparently, these days when a CD is mastered, the labels insist
the recording levels be pushed up to "11," out of fear that their CD might sound quieter than the
one next to it. Even quiet passages are pushed to be as loud as possible. Nuance has gone out the
window. This might just be influencing the way kids sing, since so many tonight thought "loud"
equalled "good."
DeAnna Prevatte -- a sullen waitress who doesn't
get good tips from the Sunday buffet crowd. It mightbe your personality, sweetheart. Idol  tries to weed out
the people who know they can't sing and just want toget on TV and Prevatte proves they usually get itright. Her subtle moment of disbelief when Simon
says she doesn't have a great voice was priceless.
Randy Stark and Crystal Ortiz -- a couple that met on an Idol  message board do a duet, with
Randy in particular trilling away like Tiny Tim. He doesnt even remember the words. A waste of
our time that seems self-promoting of the show, somehow.

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol -- Week Two, Pt 2
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/-american-idol-_b_83047.html [4/5/2009 8:08:47 PM]Michelle and Jeffrey Lampkin  -- this plus-sized brother and sister act had exuberant
personalities. No wait, actually only Jeffrey had an exuberant personality a la Luther Vandross
crossed with Mo'Nique. But they could both sing. No, actually only Jeffrey could sing. But soft-
hearted Simon said, "I can't split you two up" and sent them both to Hollywood. Another gold
ticket that seems designed for television fun rather than actual talent, since Michelle clearly was
weak.
Amy Flynn  -- one of the recurring routines this year seems to be Simon's puzzled reaction to
America. A guy walks in and says he hasn't even kissed a girl yet and Simon looks astonished.
When friends let out whoops of excitement over someone making it, Simon can't understand whyanyone would get excited over the success of someone else. And Amy walks in brandishing anincoherent but sincere plea that people wait until they're married before having sex (whether youare dating a boy or a girl, she offers gamely) and Simon again can't believe his ears. I couldn'tbelieve my ears when she sang "Reflections" by Christina Aguilera. Amy was okay -- if this were ahigh school talent show, she'd get big applause. But she was awkward throughout and justdisastrous when she got breathy and "subtle" towards the end. But Paula insisted she had asweetness about her, especially towards the end, Randy said she had "mad potential" and Simonwas right when he said many would find her annoying but said "yes" as well. Huh? I played backher audition a few times and I still don't know what they were hearing.
London Weidberg  -- she sang Billie Holiday's "Good Morning, Heartache" but -- just as Idol
intended -- what I really remember is that her dad died. London was good, though the judges
seemed less than thrilled with her and I thought for a moment she wouldn't get through. But theylike her "tone," which is definitely the word of the day, the way "pitchy" used to reign supreme.
Then in a break from the action, Randy was hopeful South Carolina would produce some better
acts because he's always heard the South will rise again. Uh, Randy, you do NOT want that to
happen in the way that's meant.
Lyndsey Goodman  -- an attractive Air Force pilot who looked a lot more nervous when she was
auditioning than when she was piloting a plane the size of a football field. Maybe she should have
just pictured Simon as a B-52 bomber. Maybe if she hadn't sung "Black Velvet." Seriously, don'tthese auditioners know the judges must be sick of the same ten songs people sing over and over.
Aretha Codner  -- Simon smiles immediately when the big-breasted Aretha shows up. But none
are smiling after she belts out Whitney Houston's "I Have Nothing." This was a rather strange
rejection. All three of the judges were brutal and treated Aretha as if she were the most talentless,horrible singer of the day. No, she shouldn't have been sent through. But it wasn't hard to hear whyfamily and friends might urge her on. Maybe if they'd acknowledged she had an okay voice and canand should enjoy singing at church or on her own, but just made clear she'd never have aprofessional career, Aretha might not have been so adamant. She wasn't William Hung forgoodness sake and that's how they acted towards her.
Joshua Boson  -- he sang "(And I Am Telling You) I'm Not Going" from Dreamgirls  and was a
total disaster. But at least his angry response and tirades to the camera while walking out seemed
genuine. Joshua was not pleased and that's a lot more fun than someone who is just begging forairtime.
In a clever use of music, Idol  showed a montage of rejections set to the tune of They Might Be
Giants singing "No!" one of their witty songs from a trio of albums geared to kids. Well done,
whoever thought of that.
Oliver Highman  -- new dad Oliver ended the night with a lot of vibrato and a friendly "no." I do
fear/believe his newly born daughter might very well audition for Idol  16 years from now and we'll
be seeing footage from this episode when she does.So, bad pacing, lots of "no's," not a single person I'm ready to gamble on as a major talent and two
out of the four people who are going to Hollywood are questionable. Was South Carolina that bador has Idol  placed telling a story ahead of showing us talented singers? Is there anyone here you
think will get to the final 12? Is this season more or less or the same amount of fun as previousyears? Tell me what you think.
