Lisa Kron's new show reaffirms her gift for turning family drama 
into universal comedy By Michael Gillz 
isa Kron, the performer and 
writer who helped start come­
dy's Five Lesbian Brothers and 
explored her father's heritage 
of the Holocaust in her ac­
claimed 1997 solo piece 2.5 Minute 
Ride, focuses on her mother's side of 
the family in her new show, Well, 
which just opened at the Public The­
ater in New York City. One of Kron's 
key story lines involves her mother's 
detemtination to raise her family in a 
racially integrated neighborhood in 
Lansing, Mich. 
Telling stories on Mom doesn't mean 
taking her for granted. "I actually had a 
dream last night that she came to see it 
for 15 minutes and then walked out," 
laughs Kron, who admits her mother 
has to draw on a "natural generosity" to 
watch her life played out onstage. 
"She's deflnitely nervous about it," 
Kron says. "But both of my parents 
have a great sense of humor. I was 
talking to them the other night, and I 
started to laugh and told her, 'I know 
I shouldn't say this, but there are 
times when you're talking when I 
think, Wow, I really got her down.' " 
In wen she also tackles her mother's chronic illness and Kron's own battles 
with chronic fatigue (which is "no 
longer an issue" for her) and mixes it 
all up with the natural insecurities of a 
girl who was detemtined to be known 
as the funniest kid in school but still 
had trouble fitting in. Mom's push for 
integration didn't help, of course. 
"My mother in the show says, 'Well, 
honey, it's true you had some tension 
with some of the black kids, but you 
didn't get along particularly well with 
the white kids either.' 
"My brother and I were complete 
social nerds," admits Kron. "Complete 
eggheads. We were never going to fit 
in. There's this character that keeps 
showing up in the play, this girl that 
tortured me [in school]. She's a 9-
year-old girl, and I'm trying to do my 
show, and she completely humiliates 
me over and over again. We end up 
having this fight onstage, and it's to­
tally wonderful." 
And while Mom wasn't be there for 
opening night-that would be too 
"meta," jokes Kron-her parents will 
be seeing it soon after and then as 
many times as they can. "We're actu­
ally going to go to my girlfriend's par­
ents' house for Passover, even though 
they're Irish Catholic," says Kron, 
who has been with her partner for 16 
years. "And then my parents are 
going to stay in town for the rest of 
the week and come see the show. 
And I would imagine, knowing my 
mother, that she will see every per­
formance while she's in town." 
Will she give any notes? "She's 
given me quite a few notes so far," 
laughs Kron .•
