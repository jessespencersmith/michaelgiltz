Critics shrugged over the potential summer
blockbuster Robin Hood,  which reteams director
Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe. With a star-heavy cast that includes Cate Blanchett, William Hurt,Max Von Sydow, the great Eileen Atkins and many
more, it's a prototypical opening night film for
Cannes. Robin Hood  delivers the star power they want
to get the flash bulbs popping. Art can wait untiltomorrow.
Most of the discussion shifted to how well the film
would do worldwide; presumably with that cast and a
large canvas, it will be fine. When an indifferent Alice
In Wonderland  from Tim Burton (who is the head of
the jury at Cannes) saunters its way to $960 million worldwide (the 8th biggest grosser of all time),
surely the equally bankable name of Robin Hood  will be a safe bet. Crowe has never made a sequel and
this franchise should change that. I just wish he'd start with another Master & Commander  instead.
The festival insists the same number of journalists are here, but it feels like a smaller contingent, at leastfrom the US. Online journalists like me have exploded from about 40 some eight years ago to 350 this
year out of 1500 or so overall. It seems...quieter, But the list of intriguing films from major directors tonew talent is -- as always -- impressive and a little overwhelming. The first day offers only two films.
Starting tomorrow, there will always be hundreds of films showing in the festival, a sidebar or in the
market and no one can come close to seeing them all.
ROBIN HOOD  ** out of ****
Director Ridley Scott mocked the original title of this Robin Hood origin story: Nottingham . If you're
going to make a movie about Robin Hood, he says, you better call it Robin Hood  or you'll spend half your
time explaining the title. Ironically, he's made a serious, sober, medieval adventure tale that is brave and

<p>fearless in depicting battle but runs in fear from any plot device even remotely similar to the Robin Hood
myth we know so well in classic films like The Adventures Of Robin Hood (one of my favorite movies of
all time). So the first person to shoot an arrow is Lady Marian, played by the game Cate Blanchett. Robindoesn't pave the way for King Richard; the Lion-Heart falls in battle towards the beginning. The Sheriffof Nottingham is toothless, for the most part. And Crowe isn't Sir Robin Of Loxley but a humble archer
who takes that name in order to save his hide after the Crusades fall apart. Robin's men aren't so merry
and the outlaws in Sherwood Forest are feral orphans scavenging for food. Almost every trope from the
Robin Hood tales is ignored or turned on its head, though thankfully at least Friar Tuck (Mark Addy) is
still a worldly man who loves a good drink. While a siege is rather hectically paced (surely battles in those
days weren't as frenetic as video games), the film has a certain confidence. And Crowe is solid as the wry
man of few words; he milks every nuance out of his lines. And he and Blanchett strike genuine sparks. It's
fine, I kept saying to myself; it's fine. Ignore the film you expected them to make and just enjoy what
they've delivered. I can't really dislike a film set in the 1100s that has the wit to nod to Monty Python andthe Holy Grail  in one early scene of theft. But while I can swallow the wholesale upending of Robin Hood
and historical accuracy is for re-enactment buffs, not me, I found myself drowning in revisionism and
just plain goofiness by the end. The French invaded England with boats akin to those invented for the D-
Day landing. Robin offhandedly declares for a universal declaration of human rights while pre-dating the
Magna Carta by years if not decades. He believes his father abandoned him at the age of six, until simply
closing his eyes brings back a flood of memories about his father being slaughtered right in front of him.Lady Marian's can-do spirit extends to ludicrous lengths. The big battle includes a laughable rehashing ofa scene from Rambo  and the coda in Sherwood Forest that sets up the adventures to come is absurdly
noble, down to Marian giving doses of medicine to some little tykes. Something is wrong when thewatercolor end credit sequence is more intriguing than the film that preceded it. Far from a turkey, it'ssure to be their biggest hit since Gladiator . Maybe with the sequel they won't be scared to have a little
fun.
TOURNEE  * out of ****
The only other film to screen today is Tournee/On Tour,  from acclaimed French actor Mathieu Amalric,
star of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly  plus about a thousand other French films. This is his fourth film
as director and tells about a down on his luck producer (who used to be big in TV) now touring the
hinterlands of France with a gaggle of New Burlesque stars he found in America. They're women -- plusone man -- who devise witty, sometimes silly acts around the strip tease. In one memorable scene,
Amalric is filling up his car and suddenly finds himself flirting with the woman at the cash register. Their
dialogue pulses with real life and genuine discovery. Is this moment the hinge the movie turns on? No,
it's just one of many random scenes but the fact that it feels focused and real just puts the rest of the film
to shame. Mostly, we watch the gals goofing around before and after their shows, complaining aboutbeing hustled from town to town, putting on their costumes, rehearsing and performing before they pack
up, head to a new city and do it all over again. Much is discovered: Amalric's producer character has two
sons, an ex-wife, an ex-girlfriend with breast cancer and mountains of debt and bad will in Paris. Theleader of the burlesque artists flirts mildly with him. And the show goes on. Even this description is
probably too forceful and direct to get across the meandering pointlessness of the film. Mostly I thought
about the power of the moustache. Amalric simply had to grow a seedy, porn-producer sort of stache andI immediately knew who this guy was. It's in Competition simply because of Amalric's great track record
as an actor. (The very light smattering of applause it received surely came from the French contingent.)
But then, the festival never programs movies it is high about on the first or second day. At least we got tosee some burlesque acts. And there's always tomorrow.

New Rule: Crowe must do a project against type or risk losing all relevance. We know you can do
epics, gotcha. Try a comedy on for size. An action-thr iller maybe? Russell Crowe in this film is as
unexpected as a fat person 'supersizi ng it'. And that's why Iron Man will be #1 again this weekend.
No one really cares about this $237 million waste of a film. When it bombs, some studio suit shouldlose their job.
I've seen the trailers for this film on TV. The romance seems a bit overdone and there's an awful lot
of general screaming and yelling. These things tell me to put this on my "must miss" list. Give methe Robin Hood of Errol Flynn - hardly historical ly accurate, but an all-around engaging film.
Nothing can match Errol Flynn. But I would say that the romance is handled pretty subtly,doesn't dominate the action and the two do have good chemistry. It's certainly not a

Crowe said it: "My theory would be, if Robin Hood was alive today, he would be looking at the
monopoliza tion of media as the greatest enemy."
Yep
All the same. All dull. All dumb. All slick. All FORGETTABL E.
Sounds like Ridley Scott doesnt want to challenge his media paymasters of threaten his movie's
support. Too bad. The entire point of Robin Hood is rabble-rou sing and the Nottingham Sheriff is
supposed to be an opressor. Thought about seeing this, not anymore. Dont need Maid Marion asAeon Flux either. Same old stupid formula dreck.
What do you expect from this type of blockbuste r "dreck"? Although Scott made "Bladerunn
er," he also makes a few bucks from bad tv, presumable y to finance the films he's making
now. The reviewer needs to focus more on the films as films, and less what he would likethem to be. Robin Hood is not even a historical character, so whatever is done, said orfilmed bears no relation to history; it's what the director wants it to be. Check out suchminor items as the cinematogr aphy and the mise-en-scene, if you can, prior to rendering
critical judgments. Stay away from all the plot summarizin g.
Sorry. That should be "presumabl y," and "less on what he would like them to be."

The best part of the press conference for Robin Hood was what Crowe said about the media:
See Robin Hood vs. The Tea Baggers: http://www .newscorps e.com/ncWP /?p=1643
"My theory would be, if Robin Hood was alive today, he would be looking at the monopoliza tion of
media as the greatest enemy."A brilliant analysis. Robin Hood would be a great symbol to counter the Tea Party. He is a heroic
progressiv e and one of the early practition ers of "redistrib uting the wealth."
So is this Robin Hood or "Gladiator - Sherwood Forest"?FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

Russel Crowe don't matter what movie role he plays, he is special. His earthy qualities , like the
land in Australia, distinguis hes him from any superficia l hero in Hollywood.
Gotta agree!
Yep, he's a very good actor and gives this film what heft it has by his performanc e.
The reason "The Lord of the Rings" was such a success was that Jackson did not fiddle with
Tolkein's archetypes - the lost king, the humble commoner given world-savi ng quest, etc.
Robin Hood is an archetype - and one very apposite to our age with its ordinary folk oppressed byrobber bankers rather than robber barons - but in running "in fear from any plot device evenremotely similar to the Robin Hood myth we know so well" Ridley Scott clearly totally misses the
mark in a way the original Robin Hood never would have.
