8/15/2005 02:17:00 PMClosing military bases in the US is always a difficult processfraught with political overtones (no Congressman or Senatorwants a base closed in their state). But lying about it to theAmerican people is unacceptable. Bush's administration isclaiming we'll save $50 billion over the next 20 years if weclose down the bases they want.The only problem? They're lying.The real figure is $25 billion if not less because most savingswould come from eliminating jobs and most of the jobs done atthese bases wouldn't disappear, they'd just move somewhereelse. The New York Times reports that eight out of ninemembers of the panel studying this problem have seriousdisagreements with Bush's claim and have asked for anindependent study to come up with a "realistic" figure. Youknow, one that isn't a lie.
