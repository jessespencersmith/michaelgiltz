The Manchurian 
candidate 
*'/2 
Paramount, $29.95 
Anyone who has seen the 
1962 original will know what 
an utterly unnecessary and 
uninvolving remake this 
Jonathan Demme movie is. 
Meryl Streep has a little fun as 
the political mom-from-hell 
(and just got a GQlden Globe 
nomination) but' Liev 
Schrieber is far too intelligent 
a prese~<;e to play her passive, 
brainwashed son. There are 
deleted scenes ~d outtakes 
all with commentary by , 
Demme, who at least did a 
mildly better job here than 
with that still-born "Charade" 
remake. 
De-Lovely 
* MGM,$26.98 
This'Irwin Winkler biopic is 
just as timid towards Cole 
Porter's sex life as 1946's 
"Night and Day" starring Cary 
Grant (a movie they have the 
temerity to mock). Yes, "De­
Lovely" actually admits Porter 
was gay (a dapper Kevin Kline 
is occasionally seen in bed 
with men) but it insists the 
love of his life was Linda 
(Ashley Judd), who was really 
more of a motherly figure to 
the composer. Shouldn't they 
know better? One scene with 
John Barrowman has a little 
heat (Porter teaches him to The Simpsons 
Complete F'1fth 
Season 
**** Fox, $49.98 
Watching the bril­
liant fifth season of 
"The Simpsons" (with 
episodes like "Homer 
Loves Flanders" and 
"Marge On The Lam") 
throws into sharp relief 
how tepid the show has 
become. It's still good 
for a few laughs, but 
please end "The 
Simpsons" now so it 
can still maintain a lit­
tle dignity. Also out: 
"Fat Albert and the 
Cosby Kids" 
(UrbanWorks, $14.99) 
and "Family Guy: The 
Freakin' Sweet 
Collection" (Fox, 
$19.98). 
sing "Night and Day") and the 
musical performances by 
Robbie Williams, Diana Krall 
and others keep it bearable. 
Napoleon Dynamite **'/2 
Fox, $29.99 
This eccen­
tric comedy 
about a high 
school nerd 
extraordinaire 
was a genuine 
word of mouth 
hit that ran for 
months in the­
aters. Pluses: a nicely dorky 
score. Minuses: our hero (Jon 
Heder) spends most of the 
movie with his eyes half shut. 
It's no "Rushmore," but it is 
harmless fun. The extras 
include two short films and 
commentary by the director 
and star. 
White Thunder 
*** Image, $29.99 
Robert Flaherty (1922's 
"Nanook of the North") wasn't 
the only early filmmaker head­
ing off to exotic lands to cap­
ture a vanishing way of life. 
New Yorker Varick Frissell 
did the same in the '20s and 
this documentary details his 
final, ill-fated voyage to 
Newfoundland in 1931. 
The real treats are the 
extras: three complete shorts 
by Frissell.</p>
