DIXIE CHICKS 
The strong-minded trio 
is unafraid to make noise 
BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
uddenly, the Dixie Chicks 
are everywhere. They 
appeared on "Oprah" except at the top of the charts and in sold·out stadiums . 
Their new album, "Taking the Long Way," has only gone 
platinum, a far cry from their previous three CDs, which 
sold 12 million, 10 million and 6 million copies each in the 
U.S. alone, numbers that made them the best-sell· t 1 I ~ 
Why such importance for just attending a music con_ 
cert? Because of what Maines refers to as "the com­
ment": An onstage remark at a 2003 show in London, 
during the runup to the Iraq war, in which Texas-born 
and did a "VH 1 Story­
tellers" concert, and a 
new documentary about 
them, "Shut Up & Sing," 
opened on Friday. ing female music group of all time, They've had 
to cancel SOJTle dates on their current tour, 
and the crowds are smaller. 
Still, "It was completely surprising to me 
to feel the energy in our audience even if it 
is half the people," says singer-songwriter 
Natalie Maines. "} think we are experienc­
ing something that no other band has ever 
experienced . Our fans that are at the show 
feel like they have a purpose." Maines said: "Just so you know, we're ashamed the 
President of the United States is from Texas," 
Pretty bland stuff as far as Bush-bashing 
goes, but in the world of country-pop music, 
it was shocking Filmmaker Barbara Kop­
pIe (who won an Oscar for 1976's doc "Har­
lan County, USA" and for 1990's "Alneri­
can Dream") had approached Maines and 
bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Ma-. The backlash 
is 'something 
no band has 
They're everywhere, experienced.' guire about following them for a documenta· 
ry well before Maines' comment sparked fan 
protests and a blackballing of the group by rna· 
jar radio conglomerates , When the Chicks finally 
agreed, it came together on the heels of that battle. 
What "Shut Up & Sing" ultimately presents is a band 
whose bond grows stronger even as they receive seri­
ous death threats, struggle to respond to vicious attacks 
without compromising their integrity and watch as their 
commercial popularity plununets . The result of it all is 
that the three women have taken control of their music 
like never before. (At press time, NBC had reportedly reo 
fused to air advertisements for the film.) 
"What the film shows is a personal transformation, 
how they grew up from 2003 to 2006," says Kopple. 
"They got catapulted into the center of a much larger 
political debate and Lssues like freedom of speech and 
opposition to the U S. in Iraq. The Chicks are very 
strong They will not back down They will stay and fight 
for what they believe in " 
On their new CD, Maines, Robison and Maguire for 
the first time wrote or co-wrote every track, working 
with producer Rick Rubin and making the defiant rock' 
tune "Not Ready to Make Nice" their personal theme. 
"That's ultimately why we don't have any regrets," 
says Maines. 'We never would've had thLs record 
"Also, I always felt like a very honest person It both­
ered me that apparently so many people thought I be· . 
lieved certain things and thought a certain way because ·:i j 
of the kind of music I played. 
"I have no goal to regain fans, but it is fun for us and 
we like the goal of getting new fans. More fans, but dif­
ferent ones." • ,</p>
