vived as artistic director and plans to helm
for a good decade to come - that has tak-
en root at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre.
And Spacey couldn't be happier.
"l'm very happy that we're bringing our entire ethos
with us," Spacey says. "lt's not just a show coming; it,s a
whole company coming. We have workshops through the
entlre run with kids from New York Citv schools. We,re
doing a U.S.and U.K. exchmge of playwrights. We re do-
ing 24-hour plays [a program in whrch a one-act is writ-
ten and staged within 2.1 hours to get young people ex-
cited about theaterl. That's in June. And we have student
seats every night at 925
"These are things that we fought for, because there,s
no point in cominB unless it's the compuny coming.
There are I 1 peop.le on our staff wbo are going to be here
over the next number of months doins all the work that
we do in London. ' Howard Davies heims the show.
Although the collaborative nature of makine mov-
ies is often obscured by those tamous faces people see at
the multiplex, theater is undeniably a from-the-boards-
up team effort. And Spacey - despite being a two-time
AcademyAward-winner and A-lisl Dresence last seen on
film as superuiJlain Lex Luthor in 2b06's..Supeman Re-
tums" - clearly loves lhe inclusive nalure oi lhe stage. a
path he set aside after moving into film in the early ,90s,
when he gave memorably acidic turns in 1992,s ,.Glen-
garry Glen Ross" and 1994's combo of,.The Ref, and
"Swimming With Sharks "
"I made a conscious effort after'Lost in yonkers, lthe1991 Neil Simon comedy that won Spacey a Tony for
Best Featured Actor in a Play] to focus on film for a de-
cade," says the 4?-year-old, New Jersey-born actor
"It was m absolutely conscious decision,,, Spacey adds
"And then, at the end of i999, I was like, ,Well - that
went better than I thought "'
