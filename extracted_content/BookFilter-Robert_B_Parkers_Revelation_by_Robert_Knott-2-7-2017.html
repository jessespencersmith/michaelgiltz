From the Publisher: Itinerant lawmen Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch return
to confront an escaped criminal in the grittiest entry yet of the New York
Times bestselling series.  Territorial marshals Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch
figured things had finally settled down in Appaloosa when Boston Bill
Black’s murder charge was dropped. But all that changed when AugustusNoble Driggs was transferred to a stateside penitentiary just across the
border from Mexico.  Square-jawed, handsome, and built like a muscled
thoroughbred stallion, Driggs manages to  intimidate everyone inside the
prison walls, including the upstart young warden. In a haunting twist of
fate, Driggs and a pack of cold-blooded convicts are suddenly on the loose—and it’s up to any and all territorial lawmen, including Cole and Hitch,
to capture the fugitives and rescue the woman kidnapped during their…

What We Say
I love a good Western. So one of the many reasons I mourned the death of author Robert B. Parker was the very selfish one
that he was just gaining steam writing a series of terrific Westerns about US Marshals Cole and Hitch. Terse, funny andviolent, the series was settling into an admirable groove. With Parker writing one a year during the last three years of his
life, it's literally the last roundup for this talented author. If you haven't read them, by all means do. Now they've been
continued by Robert Knott to modestly diminishing returns. This is the fifth he's penned, so Knott has now outstrippedParker, though undoubtedly Knott would say he stands on the shoulder of what Parker began. One recent title ("TheShare This Book

<p>Bridge") had an unwelcome supernatural touch. Happily, we're back to down and gritty here, with the two lawmen tracking
some escaped convicts, uneasily aware that one of the bastards might be holed up in their hometown while they're away
chasing the others. I can't help loving these two men -- Cole with his iron-rod sense of right and wrong, Hitch's more
expansive view of humanity, Cole's confusion over his lover's mercurial ways, their banter about grammar (Cole does love tolearn new words) and so on. They remain a treat, even if the story itself doesn't quite satisfy at the somewhat rote violentfinale. Still, I'll almost certainly feel drawn to hear from them again when a new book comes out -- which is precisely howand why a series like this continues long after the original author and inspiration is gone. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“Knott nails the terse, wise-guy dialogue….Just damngood reading and painfully suspenseful.” -- Booklist
Praise for Robert B. Parker’s Blackjack
“Knott . . . adds a new wrinkle here with a damn fine mystery running parallel to the western story. . . . Fine
reading for western fans.” — Booklist
 
“This is the most satisfying of Knott’s Cole-Hitch tales, with a shocking double-twist ending.” — The Sacramento
Bee 
“Westerns need atmosphere as much as story, and Knott has a knack for six-gun verisimilitude, sketching theland and summer heat, the horses and the shopkeepers. Knott’s especially good with the prototypical Old Westmarshal, Virgil Cole, ‘perfectly present in the here and now,’ every inch stoic lawman. . . . His tale gallops alongwithout confusing readers new to the series. . . . A darn good way to pass an afternoon.” — Kirkus Reviews
