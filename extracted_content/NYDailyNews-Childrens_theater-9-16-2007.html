usher in a great
SeaSOn BYMTcHAEL err,Tz
arents who want to get their kids excited about
the theater have lots of blockbusters to choose
from on Broadway already ("The Lion King,"
"Mary Poppins') And in November, "The Little
Mermaid" begins previews as "Dr. Seuss'How
the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical" retums for
what looks like an annual engagement. Even'Young
Frankenstein" might get l2-year-olds to put down
their Game Boys and start Puttin' on the Ritz
But families focusing only on mega-events may
miss out on a remarkable range of entertaining, chal-
lenging and fun theater being created by a host of
original companies across the city. With styles rang-
ing from puppetry to comedy to socially aware dra-
mas and sophisticated musicals that encourage cre-
ativity and imagination, children's theater is stronger
than ever. Here's a quick hopscotch around town for
some of the fall offerings
MANHATTAN CHILDREN'S TH EATRE

ll CT is enterinS its sixth season wirh an adaptation ot Margaret
lvl Wise Brown s classic "Goodnight Moon" on the heels of its
I lrecent,immensely popularproductionot"Go. Dogco!"
The hour-iong "0o9," with a cast of half a dozen tail-and-earred
performers (plus a bemused accordion player) "wasn't your typical
fairy tale," says Laura Stevens, who co-founded l\4CT with Bruce
Merrill, who helmed that show "lt took all the elements of theater
and really made imagination be a central part of it. The music was
fantastic and the costumes were great. We're going to bring it
back. We've had other shows that would sell out the whole run But
that one ws oacked."
Still amded that a theater company dedicated to children's
progmmming can make a go of it - MCT hd a generous, not-a-
bad-seat-in-the-house location at 52 White St., nestled between
Tribeca and Chinatown - Stevens is excited about pushing the
boundaries of what people can expect from kid's theater
with "coodnight Moon," which is
cutrently running through
Dec. 9. Following that will be
"Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse,"
from Dec. 15 to Feb. 3,
2008; "Hansel

Numeroff's book that MCT audiences ate up last year.
"Our music director is just going crazy on the harmonies for
'Moon,"' Stevens says "lt's beautiful, but it's definitely taking it to
another level Children deserue the best, just like adults do."

active, with after-school programs that benefit from careful
planning, parental involvement and high-quality productions.
The CTC approach is working at a handful of schools in the city
and expanding throughout the country, says Mehr Mansouri, who
co-founded the group with Roya Movafegh. And what happens off
the stage is just 6 important as what happens on it.
"Our whole goal is to have a theatrical'think tank,'where the
kids are not only participating in what kind of world they want, but
they also become the voices of positive change," says Mansouri."When they do these musicals, an adult audience listens to the
themes with a different view"
Mansouri talks passionately about the impact theater can have
on kids and says auditions for the next season will take place
this month and next month, with performances in January and
February at its main space in the Village. But CTC is active in the
schools and community year-round.
"We want the kids to use the theater to transform themselves
and their community," Mansouri says.
CZECHOSLOVAK-AM ERICAN
MARIONETTE THEATRE
Q1D n7-3891; wwwczechmaionet'tes.org
ith shows typically suitable for ages 5 to 105, the
Czechoslovak-American Marionette Theatre isn't just
stringing along the art of puppetry - it's hoisting it to
new levels. Anyone who thinks Howdy Doody is what puppeky
still amounts to will be amazed at what a captivating, classic and
unique experience genuine marionette theater can be.
Founder Vit Horejs, a veteran puppeteer, founded CAMT after
discovering a dusty box filled with antique marionettes in a church
sitting in the heart of the fading Czech community on the upper
East Side. He says he enjoys the frisson of combining live actors
with marionettes.
"Has somebody joined us from the audience?" Horejs says. "Yes,
some of the puppeteers saw our shows over the years and then
wanted to join us."
A recent revival of "Faust" just concluded. Up next from the
smart, literary-minded company is "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark" in
November at lane's Carousel. 56 Water St.
