FUNNY FISIS OF FURY
ffi ackie Chan is the undisputed sensei - master - of
ffi t<ung fu comedies. He practically invented the genre
S back in 1978 and has been kicking butt ever since.
S Chan's'The Forbidden Kingdom" (co-starring Jet Li)
comes out this month and he lends a voice to Jack Blacks
animated "Kung Fu Panda," opening June 6. Anotherkung
fu comedy, "The Foot Fist Way," about a tae kwon do
instructor who goes on a pilgrimage to meet his martial arts
hero, is also outthis summer.
Here's the best of the comedies that kick, punch and
scream out "hi-yaaah!" in between one-liners. Michael GilE
W KUNG FU HUSTLE (2OO4)1_u4 r
N THEY CALL ME BRUCE? (1982)
lGck Everyone loves Bruce Lee, but you wouldn't
want to be confused with actually being Bruce Lee.
Getting beat up constantly so other people can boast
they kicked Lee's butt is no fun.
Rmdr (lip): lt proved that musician Rick
Springfield was way off base for complaining that
people contused him with Springsteen. What's the
worst that could happen? They'd demand you sing
"Born to Run"?
N RUSH HOUR(1998)
lGclc Jackie Ghan is a fish out of water as a
strait-laced Hong Kong detective coming to America
to rescue a diplomat's daughter, defeat the evil
mastermind and endure the rule-bending lunacy of
Chris Tucker.
Pttrdr Gne): Low on action stunts but high on
comedy and charm, this was the perfect vehicle to
make Chan a star in the West once and for all. ol0clc Sing $layed by co-writer and director Stephen Chow)
desperately wants to be a gangster, but stumbles onto a housing
complex where the obnoxious landlady and mild-seeming
residents are in fact kung fu rnasters in disguise.
Prndr (IneI Chow proved himself the heir-apparent to Chan
with this visually stunning, over-the-top comic tour de force filled
with hilarious sight gags, unlikely combatants and exciting action.
"$ DRUNKEN
MASTER (1978)
l6dc Jackie Chan's
breakthrough featured
him as an unruly student
who is taught "The Eight
Drunken lmmortals"
fighting styles, but only
practices seven because
he thinks the "Drunken Miss Ho' is too unmanly. Big mistake.
Rrndr (line): The movie was a roaring success that made
Chan a star and rescued kung fu movies from self-importance.
N SHAOLTN SOCCER(2OOI)
Itr A ragtag group of shaolin kung fu experts - with names
like lron Head, Hooking Leg and Empty Hand - join forces on
a soccer team to defeat Team Evil and promote the pnctice of
shaolin far and wide.
Ptrndr (hn): The joke was on this Stephen Chow movie,
which was a huge success everywhere else but was chopped up</p>
