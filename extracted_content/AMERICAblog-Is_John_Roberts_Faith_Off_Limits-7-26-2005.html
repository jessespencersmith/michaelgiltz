7/26/2005 02:36:00 PMNew, conflicting reports about what Roberts said to Durbinabout his Catholic faith. But the far right wants to pretend thatsimply asking a candidate about their faith and how it mightconflict with their role as a public servant is wrong. Ridiculous.As a Supreme Court justice and a Catholic, Roberts will befaced with issues where voting one way could expose him torefusal of Communion and even excommunication from hisChurch. That is extraordinary and NEW pressure that Catholicshave never faced before. In the past, the Church went out ofits way to dismiss as absurd any idea that Catholic politicianswould be puppets of Rome. Now the Church says very explicitlythat politicians MUST do as Rome says or suffer theconsequences. This is a BRAND NEW situation that has neverbeen in effect. Roberts is the FIRST Supreme Court nomineewho will be put into his lifetime position with this addedpressure weighing down on him.As a Catholic myself, I could state publicly that I see my dutyto the American people first and my faith second and that thebishops are wrong to insist faith must trump the Constitution.We live in a democracy, not a theocracy, and I see a greatdanger in placing any one faith above any other in the publicsphere. I would also challenge those bishops publicly on theirinconsistency -- threatening to refuse communion overabortion but not over capital punishment; having the Popecondemn a war as unjust but insisting it would be a sin to NOTvote for the president that began it and so on.Finally, no one is objecting to anyone's faith. We are objectingto anyone who says they would place their personal beliefs --whether in Catholicism or Judaism or Scientology or Smurfs orany New Age philosophy -- ahead of the law. If you're anOrthodox Jew, fine. But if that means you're going to ruleagainst any business that wants to do business on Saturdays,you don't belong on the Supreme Court. It's as simple as that.Do you place your faith above the Constitution? If not, can yougive us ONE example where you've gone against your faith? Ifyou can't, why should we believe you?
