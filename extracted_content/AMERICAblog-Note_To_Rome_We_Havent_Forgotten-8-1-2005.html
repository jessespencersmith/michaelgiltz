8/01/2005 01:00:00 PMTwo priests defrocked...about forty years too late.In 1984, Eugene O'Sullivan was sentenced to probationafter he admitted sodomizing a 13-year-old altar boy. Acondition of his sentence was that he not be allowedto work with children.But O'Sullivan was later assigned to four New Jerseyparishes. He was recalled to Boston in 1992 after churchofficials learned of another allegation against him dating tohis time in Massachusetts.Documents from O'Sullivan's personnel file, made public in2002, show that the archdiocese was alerted as earlyas the 1960s to allegations against him.In a 2003 deposition he gave in lawsuits filed against thearchdiocese, Cardinal Bernard Law defended hisdecision to allow O'Sullivan to transfer, saying hewanted to give O'Sullivan a chance at "redemption."Law resigned as archbishop of Boston but remains acardinal.In my anger, I bolded practically half the article. You don't offer adrunk redemption by giving him a job in a bar. A priest who molestschildren can be forgiven by God, but it is the duty of us on Earth toprotect the children, not ignore the danger these people represent.Law was simply trying to brush a problem under the rug or is sotwisted in his views of what is "normal" that he didn't think it wasthat big a deal. (I'm not exaggerating that; numerous comments bybishops about the rape of 13 year old boys that try to portray it asconsensual sex show they are way out of touch with mainstreamsociety.)This is why many Catholics are leaving the Church.
