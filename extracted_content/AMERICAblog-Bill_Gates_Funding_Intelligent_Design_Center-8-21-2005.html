8/21/2005 08:41:00 PMThe NY Times has a solid piece on the Discovery Institute, thefar right religious group posing as a scientific think tank. Itshows how they've pushed more and more into public policyand influencing school curriculum by repackaging creationismin a clever manner and changing the debate from science vs.religion (ie evolution versus ID) to "teach the controversy,"which sounds reasonable because most parents don't realizewhat they're really saying is "teach our narrow religious beliefsin science class."The big surprise for me was finding out the Gates Foundationhas provided targeted funding to a branch of the DiscoveryInstitute called Cascadia, which focuses on regionaltransportation. (They're giving $10 million over ten years.)Cascadia even set up its own separate web site so peoplewouldn't keep linking it with the creationists. But how can anypart of a think tank devoted to attacking science, dumbingdown our kids' education and shoving their own fundamentalistbeliefs into public schools be trustworthy? The DiscoveryInstitute is the enemy of science and a good education. Whywould Bill Gates want to be linked to it in any way?
