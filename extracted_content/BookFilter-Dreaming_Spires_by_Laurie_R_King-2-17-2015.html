Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayI'd call Laurie R. King's series about a married Sherlock Holmes and his younger, thoroughly engaging wifeMary Russell a guilty pleasure if they weren't so convincing. I suppose hardcore Holmesians might have nit topick. But as a lifelong fan of Holmes who is both delighted at an opportunity to see what others can do with thisiconic character and wary of the attempt, I've found the series by Russell to be dependably enjoyable. Thisouting is especially sprightly with Russell and Holmes having great fun as they end up in Japan. Needless tosay, they do everything from travel the countryside in disguise almost as a lark to crossing the paths of a secretsociety and the Emperor, of course. (Holmes has always had a soft spot for nobility, I'd say.)

For Holmes fans, mystery loversand those interested in either Japan or Oxford, this novel is a multilayered and entirely enjoyable journey.”—ShelfAwareness “Compulsively readable . . . Through astute, precise, and elegant writing, great attention to time and place, andbeautifully realized characters, King has created a mystery series that is at once intelligent, reflective, and actionfilled.”—Library Journal “A story that keeps the reader enthralled . . . one of the most consistently outstanding mystery series out there. Anytime spent with the Russell-Holmes duo is a delight.”—Booklist “Snappy prose and a captivating plot distinguish King’s fourteenth novel featuring Mary Russell and her husband,Sherlock Holmes. . . . Many will find the character deepened by his partnership with the spirited…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
