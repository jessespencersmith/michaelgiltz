7/08/2005 01:25:00 PMHere's some good prep for the SCOTUS battles. This veryamusing NYT op-ed looks at "activist judges." The column'sone flaw is that it says this term is used by people both on theleft and right to describe a judge who makes a ruling theydisagree with. I disagree with THAT -- I'd say the term isalmost entirely a fiction employed by the far right. The onlytime it's used by people on the left is to mock the idea of an"activist" judge.But the heart of the column is very good. It decides to definean activist judge as one who votes to strike down a law passedby Congress. That is the gist of one of the far right'scomplaints -- that the elected Congress passes a law and thatthe unaccountable, unelected Supreme Court has the nerve todeclare it unconstitutional, interfering with the will of thepeople. Obviously sometimes a law should be declaredunconstitutional, but a justice's propensity for doing it againand again is about as good an argument for being an "activist"judge as one could ask for. Of course, no surprise here: thejustices who were BY FAR willing to frustrate the will ofCongress since 1994, when the court took its current shapewere on the right:Thomas 65.63 %Kennedy 64.06 %Scalia 56.25 %Rehnquist 46.88 %O’Connor 46.77 %Souter 42.19 %Stevens 39.34 %Ginsburg 39.06 %Breyer 28.13 %So keep this in mind the next time someone screams aboutactivist judges -- you can shout back, Yeah, I can't standThomas or Scalia either.
