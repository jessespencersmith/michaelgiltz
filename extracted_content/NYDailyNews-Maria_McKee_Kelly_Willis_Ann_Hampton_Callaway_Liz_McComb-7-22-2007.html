Four performers playing New york in
the next week tell of the moment that
changed everything By MTcHAEL Grlrz
Maria McKee:D
Early'Decembe/
The teenage sensation in the '80s
band Lone Justice, McKee was build-
ing a solo career at Getfen Records
when she abruptly brought it all dom
with the wildly scattered 1996 release
"Life Is Sweet " The album effectively
ended her rnajor-label career.
"It's a verv dangerous path I've cho-
sen," says McKee, who per-forms at
Joe's Pub tomorrow and Tuesday.
She's talking from the tiny L.A apart-
ment - one her grandmother liyed in
- that McKee shares with her husband
and musical paftner, Jim Akin,
"I've committed commercial suicide
over and over again And in some cas-
es, critical suicide Some people real-
ly want me to do one kind of music that
I did really well when I w6 young. It's
not an easy road, but for me, it's true "
On "Life Is Sweet," McKee was ba-
sicaly telling her fans: Anything can
happen, wanna come along? Famous
for her country-leaning Americana
and a voice with real ache in it, McKee,
on her new album, "Late December,"
tackles the Motown stomp of "No Oth-
er Way to Love You" and the husky ter-
rain of the title track, not to mention a
yelp at the end of "Destine "'You mean
my Axl Rose moment?" laughs McKee
about her recorded vocal keen
McKee seems certain to retum to
her first love, the theater, soon. She has
finished the first draft of a play about
her relationship with her brother Bry-
an Maclean, 18 years her senior, who
was in the classic rock group Love be-fore burning out, being born again and
then living at home while McKee was
growing up and luring her from the-
ater to rock 'n' roll (IWo other plays
are in various stages as well.)
And she's still reveling in the other
turning point of her peBonal and pro-
fessional life: meeting Akin, who co-
writes, produces, photographs and col-
laborates with her on eveMhing
"I had four days to find a bass play-
ef, Actually," McKee laughs, "I knew
Jim's wife at the time She really, real-
ly wmted to get him to join the band. I
think she wanted to get him out of the
house because she had a boyfriend. So
it worked out for everyone!" o (Joe's
Pub, JuLy 23 ond 24; 425 Lafdyette St ,

tion," says Callaway, whose four-night
stand at the Blue Note starts Thursdav
to support her new CD, "Blues in lhe
Night." They ended up at a scary "dive
hotel," she recomts good-naturedly.
But with her Tony-nominated tum in
1999's "Swing!" on Broadway. things
changed. More change is coming: She's
co-writing songs for the upcoming film
"State ofAffairs," and her next CD will
be her first filled with originals. Plus,
the night CaUaway, 48, opens at the
Blue Note, her pilot for a PBS series
about the art of singing debuts on TV in
her hometown of Chicago.
She says her om art got kick-started
when she read Bob Dylan's stream-of-
consciousness novel "Taranhria" at age
l2 'l guess Bob wrote it quickly," say-s
Callaway drily, "but I thought it was fas-
cinating, [soJ I ffiote my jomal in the
same sMe. See how a kid can be cor-
rupted by musicims? I hope to corrupt
the same way." O (The BlueNote, JuIy
26-29; 13 I W. Third St., 212-475-8592)A Kel ly Wi | | is: Well-tray3.l"g:*4.
Having kids changes everything.
For country artist Willis, it tumed
going on the road from ajob into a
chance to escape She and her hus-
band - singer-songwriter Bruce Rob-
ison - take turns watching their four
kids and performing in clubs
"It used to be, whoever was leaving
was going out to work and you'd wish
'em luck - now it's the opposite!" Wr.l-
lis says about mixing a big family md
perfoming (she's at BoweryBallroom
Saturday). "Noq whoever's leaving
the house is gonna have fun, and you
wish the one staying horne luck!"
The 38-yea-oldWillis is having
more fun than ever, than}s to a rau-
cous new CD, "Translated From love,"
with upbeat originals md covers. The
singer-songwriter begm as m unhap-pily prepackaged country act on MCA
in 1990 But she sprmg to life creative-
ly afterjoining indie label Rykodisc in
1999 and releasing'nvhat I Deserue.'.,
Then she and Robison took control
of lheir personal lives as well, using
in vitro fertilization to conceive a son.
and then twins - only to be followed
by another child a bit later. Naturally,
Willis felt a little swamped. : i
"At one point, I told Rykodisc I was
quitting," says Willis "Haying twins
will make you take a second look at ev-
ery area of your life, But I've got this
family I'm so luclry tohave, so I don't
worry as much I used to be really ner-
vous all the time and self-conscious
and stressing out about [my music]
Now it's just this great gift that I get to
do this with my life " O

*JrJS"Se.mF: Gospel stew
McComb began singing rvhen she
was 3 vears old But the true revelation
came when somebody eNe stopped
singing: It was Easter Sunday, and
her older sisters went missing right
when they were supposed to perfom
at church "I will never forget that as
long as I live," laughs Mccomb, who
stepped up and sang her heart out andhasn't stopped since She plays Central
Park Summerstage on Saturday.
The Cleveland-bom McComb has
since traveled the world with her all-
embracing approach to gospel music
that includes New Orleans jazz, funk,
rap, soul and traditional. Her new CD,
"Soul, Peace & Love," mirrors the first
time she left the U S and found her
musical home in Europe
"I was in my late 20s," she says, "but
I was a kid because I'd been unqer mv

a woman whose tather died when she
was young and whose mother was a
Pentecostal pastor who, far from strict
in terms of influence, encouraged all
tJrpes of music in their home
Now she's coming to New York, and,
she insists, all those years of good liv-
ing haven't taken spice from her soul
'I'm not a perfect person,'' she says
'And I don't try to make people think
Ihat I am I'm a human being Some
days lrave been good, some have been
bad. But God's grace has oeen around
me." a (Central Park Summerstage,
