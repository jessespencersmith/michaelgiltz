            <p>Newer PostOlder PostS AT U R D AY,  O C TO B E R  2 1 ,  2 0 0 6Who Backed Down: Madonna Or NBC?Conflicting media reports here: The NY Daily News makes it sound likeMadonna agreed to trim and basically neuter a segment of her concertspecial for NBC, removing the section where she pleads for the world tohelp the hungry and people with AIDS. Why does NBC want this cut?Because she's seen hanging in front of a disco-ball cross while singing"Live To Tell." On the other hand, this BBC story makes it sound likeNBC overruled Madonna in making the cuts, backed up by a quotefrom one of her representatives. Now priv8pete mocked my typicalanti-censorship rants by cutting and pasting a previous post andinserting "NBC" and "Madonna" for whatever the previous partieswere. Hey, it's just our Constitution, priv8pete, didn't mean to get souptight about it:) But seriously, folks, if Madonna agreed to thechanges in this instance after enduring death threats and thepossiibility of jail time, I'm not going to second-guess her. But if NBCoverruled her and did the cut on its own, I have no sympathy. BecauseI'm anti-censorship? No, because I'm anti-stupidity. The last Madonnaconcert that DIDN'T contain at least one controversial segmentwas...uh...NEVER. How could NBC not have anticipated this possibilityand either decided not to air the special or have an agreement in placeto deal with this very problem. What, were they surprised a part ofMadonna's concert created a firestorm? Nope, that's why they wantedto air it in the first place: Madonna always gets attention.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
