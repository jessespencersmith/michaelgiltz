Want Two feels a bit like 
Rufus Wainwright vamping 
until his next album-but 
the enclosed concert DVD is 
a must for devotees of the out 
troubadour By Michael Giltz

Elton John has called Rufus 
Wainwright an "as-yet unherald­
ed American treasure," and one 
imagines Wainwright would re­
spond, with the casual confi­
dence he exudes, "Quite true." 
Treasure? Yes. But unheralded? His 
near-perfect 2003 album, Want One, 
was hailed by critics, 
hitting number 12 on 
The Village Voice's an­
nual Pazz & Jop Critics' 
Poll. Wainwright has a 
small role in Martin 
Scorsese's Oscar hope­
ful The Aviator. And de­
spite upheavals at his 
record label, Wainwright 
has just released this 
CD-DVD combo. 
It's more than a collection of odds 
and ends from the Want sessions but 
less than a proper follow-up to that CD. 
We've been told it's the "weird" stuff, 
but since Want One was already pretty 
darn eccentric, that doesn't prove quite 
true. Sure, the opener, "Agnus Dei," is a 
lovely Latin choral hymn, and the clos­
er, "An Old Whore's Diet" (a duet with 
Antony of Antony and the Johnsons), is 
an almost nine-minute wig-out. But al­
most everything here would have 
sounded right at home on Want One. The witty "Little Sis­
ter," "The Art Teacher" 
(a lovely man who is 
the protagonist's fa­
vorite work of art), and 
concert favorite "Gay 
Messiah" are among the 
strongest tracks here. But they didn't 
belong, either thematically or musically, 
on that earlier album, which is more up­
beat than this mellow affair. Wainwright 
knows the importance of creating an 
album that flows, that takes you some­
where. He produced a double album's 
worth of music, but Want One is 
stronger for not including them all. And 
Want Two is fine for fans who can't 
wait for his next magnum opus. 
What makes this truly worthwhile, 
however, is the concert DVD. It has 90 
minutes of Wainwright performing at 
THE ADVOCATE 192 I NOVEMBER 23, 2004 the Fillmore Auditorium, interspersed 
with brief segments of him wandering 
through San Francisco. He's in fine 
form, and the show is mercifully free of 
frenetic editing and quick cuts. 
You know Wainwright is in full con­
trol when he segues from the rousing "I 
Don't Know What It Is" to the quiet, 
wrenching "Dinner at Eight," and the 
crowd remains in the palm of his hand. 
His openhearted performance-so self­
dramatizing, so self-aware, so funny 
when it isn't moving-can't help but 
bring to mind another drama queen, 
Judy Garland. Surely it's only a matter 
of time before Wainwright's gorgeous 
voice tackles the standards .•
