From the Publisher: First Katherine Applegate thrilled readers  with the
action-packed Animorphs series. Then she stole our hearts with the award-
winning The One and Only Ivan.  Now she takes us on an  unforgettable
journey in this first book of an epic middle grade series!  Byx is the
youngest member of her dairne pack. Believed to possess remarkable
abilities, her mythical doglike species has been hunted to near extinction
in the war-torn kingdom of Nedarra. After her pack is hunted down and
killed, Byx fears she may be the last of her species. The Endling. So Byxsets out to find safe haven, and to see if the legends of other hiddendairnes are true. Along the way, she meets new allies—both animals andhumans alike—who each have their own motivations for joining her quest.
And although they begin as strangers, they become their own kind of
family—one that will ultimately uncover a secret that may threaten everycreature in their world. Building upon the success of her criticallyacclaimed novels such as The One and Only Ivan , Crenshaw, and Wishtree ,
while also returning to her action-packed fantasy roots of Animorphs, theEndling series is Katherine Applegate at her finest. With its enthrallingcharacters, unique setting, and gripping adventure, this series is theperfect next read for fans of Rick Riordan, Brian Jacques, and Tui T.Sutherland.

What We Say
I wish I could define the magic. First, you begin a fantasy novel that has the same ingredients as a thousand other fantasy
novels. But through some alchemy, it immediately...works. That's the case with the first book in a new series by KatherineApplegate. It begins with what might be the last of the "dairne." Her name is Byx and she's the runt of a litter, the smallest
of a group of dairne desperately on the run, searching for a sign of any other dairne left in the world. What's a dairne? It's aShare This Book

<p>dog-like creature, though calling it a dog is quite an insult. The dairne can walk on their hind legs, have opposable thumbs
and speak languages with other creatures. Byx soon finds herself alone -- perhaps utterly alone if she is, as feared, an
endling, the last of her species. While she 's too modest to begin an actual quest, Byx does soon find herself in league with
Tobble, a silly looking little creature Byx saves from drowning. He insists it is the code of his people that Tobble must savethe life of Byx not once, not twice, but three times to be free of his debt to her. They're soon joined by a girl pretendingto be a boy, a panther-like creature and a charmingly frank thief named Renzo. Byx's quest turns out to be much biggerthan the survival of her race: it might involve the survival of every race of creature that humans plan to eliminate, one by
one. Witty, charming, suspenseful, this is the sort of fantasy where unusual creatures are introduced and soon seem like old
friends. Applegate establishes her medieval world with its own rules rather easily -- dairnes can spot when others are tellinga lie and perhaps Applegate had a dairne edit her novel. I don't know if creatures like dairnes or wobbyks exist, but I knowApplegate fervently believes in them and thus so do we. While this is being pitched to middle grade readers and fans of
Redwall and the like, I think any fantasy fan will gobble it up. Now where is volume two? -- Michael Giltz
