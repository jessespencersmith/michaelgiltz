From the Publisher: London’s most brilliant but unconventional
detectives, Arthur Bryant and John May, must plumb the depths of a
particularly murky mystery.    The Peculiar Crimes Unit faces its most
baffling case yet—and if Bryant and May can’t rise to the challenge, the
entire unit may go under. Near the Tower of London, along the RiverThames, the body of a woman has been discovered chained to a stone
post and left to drown. Curiously, only one set of footprints leads to the
tragic spot. “The Bride in the Tide,” as the London press gleefully dubsher, has the PCU stumped. Why wouldn’t the killer simply dump her bodyin the river—as so many do? Arthur Bryant wonders if the answer lies inthe mythology of the Thames itself. Unfortunately, the normally wobbly
funhouse corridors of Bryant’s mind have become, of late, even more
labyrinthine. The venerable…

What We Say
This is lucky number 13 in a long-running series about a detective duo of a certain age who are the heart and soul of
London's Peculiar Crimes Unit. Before reading one of their tales, I had the mistaken impression that Peculiar Crimes impliedsome sort of fantastical element. Then when I realized the books were firmly lodged in the real world, I leapt to the idea
that Peculiar meant the sort of crimes they tackled or maybe the way they solved crimes. I was getting closer but in reality
I now feel it's the people in the PCU who are genuinely peculiar in the most delightful way. John May is the more sober-minded of the pair and Arthur Bryant is the eccentric genius over-brimming with tidbits about London's history while liableShare This Book

<p>to pull a min-easel out of one pocket and a blow torch out of the other from his voluminous, ancient coat. They are a
treat, as are the vivid other characters on their team, including oddballs like the two Daves (two blokes constantly doing
mysterious repairs) and others who are fiercely loyal to the two dear old men, not least because they have a remarkable
track record of success. Author Christopher Fowler insists each novel can be read on its own but clearly long-time fans willenjoy this the most and newcomers will feel the pull of going back and starting at the start. In "Stranger Tides," Fowlercontinues the rather poignant sight of Bryant suffering increasing signs of dementia, which naturally isn't about to keep himfrom doing his job, even if he does occasionally seem to slip back in time to the earlier London of history that is his true
love, only to "wake up" in the most embarrassing situations. A city investigator is making life difficult, thanks to being
simply agog and perhaps a little impressed at the sheer number of infractions and irregularities of the PCU. And theirhapless, long-suffering if harmless superior stands by looking daft, as always. There's a clever case involving immigrants whohave come to London on the down low and now find a talent for cons like televangelism and New Age rackets, dead bodiespiling up in the Thames and curious threads of knowledge Fowler weaves in here and there for buffs of arcana. It's all good
fun, a solid entry in the series that shows every sign of continuing, a happy prospect since I had the mistaken impression
their last tale was a swan song. Now where's the TV series this practically begs for? -- Michael Giltz
