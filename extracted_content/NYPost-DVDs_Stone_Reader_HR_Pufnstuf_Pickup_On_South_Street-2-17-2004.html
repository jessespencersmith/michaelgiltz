"STONE READIER" 
This awkward if sincere documentary ($39.95, New 
Yorker) shows the obsession of director Mark Mos­
kowitz over the out of print novel "The Stones of 
Summer" by Dow Mossman. He tracks down copies 
of the book, speaks to other fans of what he considers 
a landmark and finds out what happened to the au­
thor, who had simply disappeared. Staged moments, 
recreations -every trick of Errol Morris is used 
less adroitly here. But there's a happy ending: The 
movie's release prompted a reissue of the book. Bet­
ter than average extras feature Janet Maslin and 
Roger Ebert, among others. 
"H.R. PUFNSTUF": COMPLETE SERIES 
Were there really only 17 episodes of this 1969 fan­
tasy series about Jimmy, his magic talking flute, 
\Vitchiepoo, and the other stars of "H.R. Pufnstuf" 
($39.95, Rhino)? Maybe it looms large in the imagina­
tion because it's just so darn strange: Cockney lad 
Jack Wild as the star, Billie Hayes amusingly camp 
as the evil witch, sly druggie references, hippie pup­
pets, anti-Vietnam messages ("Make candy, not war") 
and, of course, the oddly inexpressive life-sized den­
izens of Living Island who had all their dialogue 
dubbed, adding to the surreal air of Sid and Marty 
Krofft's 3how. It was a briefhlt, b~lt no one imitated 
their style because no one could. 
"PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET" 
Wow. Samuel Fuller's no-nonsense 1953 drama 
about a pickpocket who unwittingly snags top secret 
microfilm that both the Commies and the police are 
desperate to get their hands on is just abour as adult 
and entertaining as anyone could wish. Snappy dia­
logue, a taut screenplay, a great broad (Jean Peters) 
who pays the price for falling for a tough guy -does 
it get any better than this? Nope. 
THE BEST OF ABBOn & COSTELLO 
Major kudos to Universal and its Franchise Collec­
tion series. They've been making great use of their 
catalog by packaging together relatively minor mov­
ies in inexpensive boxed sets. Here you get eight 
pretty darn funny Abbott & Costello flicks from the 
early '40s, including "Buck Privales" and "Hold That 
Ghost," for just $24.98. Parents should jump on it. 
Also out: 
On TV, even teens from outer space are better 
looking than normal kids, as proven on "Roswell": 
Season One ($59.98, Fox); John Grisham's "Run­
away Jury" ($27.98, Fox) couldn't be brought home 
even with talent like John Cusack and Gene Hack­
man; Antonioni's 1966 classic "Blow-Up" ($19.98, 
Warner Bros,) is just as important for its Herbie Han­
cock jazz score as for its storyline; Adrien Brody's 
oddball ventriloquism movie "The Dummy" ($26.98, 
Artisan) is surely the first DVD with a commentary 
track featuring a ventriloquist and his wooden part­
ner; if you dig James Spader on "The Practice," check 
out the fine TV movie "The Pentagon Papers" 
($24.99, Paramount); Iran's best exports are movies, 
including female director Samira Makhmalbafs ac­
claimed drama "Blackboards" ($24.98, Wellspring); 
1988's "Permanent Record" ($14.99, Paramount) 
may be an after-school special about suicide, but it 
has some fine acting from Keanu Reeves and others. 
Out next week: 
The third season of tlle classic comedy "The Dick 
Van Dyke Show"; Merchant-Ivory's most personal 
film, "Maurice"; and Richard Pryor's eponymous 
sketch-comedy TV series from 1977.</p>
