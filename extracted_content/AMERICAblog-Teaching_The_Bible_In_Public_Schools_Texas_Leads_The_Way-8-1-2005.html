8/01/2005 04:30:00 PMThe fight never ends. Here's a story about people trying topush their own, narrow interpretation of the Bible into thepublic school curriculum and trying to pretend it's notreligion...just a non-religious text studying the bible asliterature and as a historical document. Some highlights oftheir foolishness:Elizabeth Ridenour, a commercial real estate broker whosaid she formed the nonprofit organization in 1993 afterdeciding that she had long been "duped" into believing theBible could not be taught in public schools, said the coursehas stayed within legal limits. "Our teachers are not to say,'This is the truth,' or that the Bible is infallible," she said."They are to say, 'This is what the Bible says; draw yourown conclusions.'"Of course, that's teaching the Bible, not teaching ABOUT the Bible,but she doesn't want to understand the difference.But a growing chorus of critics says the course, taught bylocal teachers trained by the council, conceals a religiousagenda. The critics say it ignores evolution in favor ofcreationism and gives credence to dubious assertionsthat the Constitution is based on the Scriptures, andthat "documented research through NASA" backs thebiblical account of the sun standing still....Some of the claims made in the national council'scurriculum are laughable, said Mark A. Chancey, professorof religious studies at Southern Methodist University inDallas, who spent seven weeks studying the syllabus for thefreedom network. Mr. Chancey said he found it "riddled witherrors" of facts, dates, definitions and incorrect spellings. Itcites supposed NASA findings to suggest that the earthstopped twice in its orbit, in support of the literal truth ofthe biblical text that the sun stood still in Joshua and IIKings."When the type of urban legend that normallycirculates by e-mail ends up in a textbook, that's aproblem," Mr. Chancey said.Don't these people even have the courage of their convictions? TheyWANT prayer in the public school. They WANT to teach their ownfundamentalist faith in the public school. They WANT to ban anyscience that conflicts with their religious beliefs -- even if it meansour kids falling farther and farther behind the rest of the world. Whycan't they be honest? At least the good Christians and Jews andMuslims and other people of faith and even the agnostics and atheistsdon't try to lie to the American people. So why do these people lie?Because they know if they were honest about what they really wantthey know that most Americans would say, "No thanks."
