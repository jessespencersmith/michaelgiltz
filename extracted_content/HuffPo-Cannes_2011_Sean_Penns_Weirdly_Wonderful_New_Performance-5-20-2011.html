 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyCannes 2011: Sean Penn's Weirdly
Wonderful New Performance
THIS MUST BE THE PLACE  *** out of ****
The 2011 Cannes Film Festival is winding down. Most
buyers have left and many journalists have followedthem. Sean Penn already had a rather small role inTerrence Malick's The Tree Of Life , one of the best
reviewed movies of the fest and certainly the pick of
many critics to snag the top prize. Now, at the last
minute, Penn returns with one of the most eccentric,weirdly wonderful performances of his career. The Oscarrace for Best Actor has just begun.
The movie by Italian director Paolo Sorrentino sounded
like a train wreck: This Must Be The Place  is the story of
an aging rocker who goes on a quest to hunt down the Nazi that tormented his father in Auschwitz. Outof this very unpromising description comes a gentle, nutty, offbeat comic drama. Penn's character iscalled Cheyenne, and he's a reclusive pop star living in Ireland. Cheyenne stopped performing after two
fans committed suicide to his mopey music. Now he just wanders out of his mansion dragging a shopping
cart behind him, hanging out with a teenage girl whose brother has gone missing and generally justgliding through his days.

<p>Penn plays Cheyenne like some demented cross between Robert Smith of The Cure and Andy Warhol. He
has a little boy demeanor, a wary fascination with the world and a giggly little laugh. And yet he's alsowounded, smart and simmering with unresolved feelings for the Jewish father Penn hasn't spoken withfor more than 30 years. Unlike Johnny Depp's oddball characterizations in movies like the Piratesfranchise and Alice in Wonderland , Penn's work is actually grounded in a character and a movie of
genuine if overbaked substance, which makes it all the more satisfying. It ranks with his turn in Woody
Allen's Sweet And Lowdown  and Fast Times At Ridgemont High  as a comic highlight of Penn's career
and makes you wish he'd tackle comedy more often. Here's a lowkey scene where Cheyenne says goodbyeto his wife as he leaves for America to be by his father's bedside. It does contain one crude word so it's
Not Suitable For Work, but it's the only clip I could find.
The movie is episodic and indeed quixotic as Cheyenne quietly hunts down the Nazi who -- if he's even
still alive -- must be 95-years-old. Cheyenne visits relatives of the man, bumps into strangers and
unexpectedly proves both savvy and determined at getting what he wants. The music is especially good,
mixing in pop tunes with a traditional score that is very effective. Numerous set pieces work terrificallywell (like a game of ping pong), though there's no question the story overreaches a bit and the finale is atad confusing. Still, the supporting cast is very strong, from Frances McDormand as Cheyenne'sunderstanding wife who works as a firewoman (I told you it was wacky) to Harry Dean Stanton as a guyCheyenne befriends in a cafe.
What inspired Sorrentino (the director behind the excellent Il Divo)  to come up with such a tale is
beyond me, but he has expanded on the flowering of talent he showed in Il Divo  by delivering a movie
not just technically admirable but truly entertaining in a Hal Ashby, 1970s sort of way. It's flawed, and
some will dismiss it. But he's provided a memorable role for one of the best actors of our time, a role thatallows Penn to dig deep, but also giggle, and even offer a tip about how to keep lipstick fresh all day long.
