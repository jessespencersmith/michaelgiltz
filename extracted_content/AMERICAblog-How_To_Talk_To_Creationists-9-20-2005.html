9/20/2005 03:18:00 PMFrom a NYT article about museums providing new training foremployees bombarded with questions from aggressivecreationists who question and attack every basic principle ofscience:A pamphlet handed out at the training session...offerssuggestions on replying to frequently raised challenges like"Is there lots of evidence against evolution?" (The answerbegins, simply, "No.")When talking to visitors about evolution, the pamphletadvises, "don't avoid using the word." Rehearse answers tofrequently asked questions, because "you'll be morecomfortable when you sound like you know what you'retalking about."Dr. Allmon told his audience to "be firm and clear, notdefensive." The pamphlet says that if all else fails, anddocents find themselves in an unpleasant confrontation,they excuse themselves by saying, "I have to go tothe restroom."The old 'I have to pee' defense! That'll stop those creationists dead intheir tracks.
