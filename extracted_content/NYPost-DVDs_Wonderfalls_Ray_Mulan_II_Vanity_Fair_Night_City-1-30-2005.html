Ray **'/. Universal, $29.98 
Jamie Foxx deserves to win 
the Oscar for Best Actor -but 
more so for his marvelous lead 
turn in "Collateral," the tough 
B-movie he got a nomination 
for under the Supporting Actor 
category. He's terrific here, too, 
but "Ray" is just a standard 
biopic with a sappy ending. 
Thank God for the great music 
throughout that keeps it fun. 
Extras include uncut 
performances of those songs 
and a mini-documentary about 
Foxx's tral}sformation. 
Mulan II *'/2 Disney, $29.99 
Disney continues to churn out 
direcHo-DVD titles like this 
mild sequel to "Mulan," with our 
heroine objecting to arranged 
marriages and defending China 
(again). A good voice cast -
including Ming-Na, B.D. Wong 
and Harvey Fierstein -can't 
rescue poor animation and even 
poorer imagination. You're better 
off with one of the new Chuck 
Jones DVDs just out, like his 
adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's 
"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi" (Lions Gate, 
$9.98) narrated by Orson Welles. 
Vanity Fair 
*11> • 
Universal, $29.98 
Some actors just aren't 
convincing in period films and Wonderfalls: 
ComDlete Series *** Fox, $39.98 
This quirkY drama 
probably sets a record 
for including the most 
unseen episodes (nine in 
all) for a TV show out 
on DVD. Also out: 
classic episodes from 
"Frasier: Fourth Season," 
"Cheers: Fourth Season," 
"Taxi: Second SeaSon" 
(Paramount, $38.99 
each), "I Love Lucy: 
Season 3" (Paramount, 
$54.99), "Soap: Third 
Season" (Columbia 
TriStar, $29.95), and the 
nicely crass Britcom 
"Men Behaving Badly: 
Seasons 1 and 2" (BBC 
Video, $19.98 each). 
Reese Witherspoon is one of 
them. She didn't work in 2002's 
"The Importance of Being 
Earnest" and she comes up short 
again in this confused Mira Nair 
adaptation of the classic novel. 
Hopefully, the upcoming Johnny 
Cash biopic "Walk The Line" is 
close enough in time that she 
won't hit the wrong note as June 
Carter. 
Night and the City ***'/2 Criterion, $39.95 
Noir films are often stolen by 
great supporting actors and this 
sad 1950 tale of the wrestling 
racket in post-war London is no 
exception. The most larcenous 
actor? The implacable Francis L. 
Sullivan, who also stole David 
Lean's "Great Expectations" and 
every other film he ever 
appeared in. Extras include a 
new 20 minute chat with 
director Jules Dassin.</p>
