8/01/2005 02:00:00 PMBush lied to Congress about the cost of his prescription pillplan. Bush doctors science papers, denies facts and generallyavoids reality based thinking whenever possible. Bush lied toCongress in his State of the Union -- and caved practically theday he was called on it. And now Bush has lied again.He strong-armed Republicans into passing a (lack of) energybill that will do nothing to make our country stronger and saferand less dependent on foreign powers for our energy needs.God forbid we try to reduce consumption of oil or anythingnutty and liberal like that.But it wasn't easy, so Bush had to conveniently delay an EPAreport that makes abundantly clear that our country'sautomotive fleet is desperately falling behind -- fuelconsumption is getting worse and worse. Hey, it's just ournational security we're talking about.The contents of the report show that loopholes inAmerican fuel economy regulations have allowedautomakers to produce cars and trucks that aresignificantly less fuel-efficient, on average, than theywere in the late 1980's.Releasing the report [on time] would have beeninopportune for the Bush administration, its critics said,because it would have come on the eve of a final vote inCongress on energy legislation six years in the making. Thebill, as it stands, largely ignores auto mileageregulations.The executive summary of the copy of the report obtainedby The Times acknowledges that "fuel economy isdirectly related to energy security," becauseconsumer cars and trucks account for about 40percent of the nation's oil consumption. But trendshighlighted in the report show that carmakers are notmaking progress in improving fuel economy, andenvironmentalists say the energy bill will do little to prodthem.That's right, one of the easiest and simplest ways to improve ournational security -- push automakers to build cars that are more fuelefficient -- and Bush can't even be bothered. Sadly, as hybrid cars areproving, it would be good for business, too.
