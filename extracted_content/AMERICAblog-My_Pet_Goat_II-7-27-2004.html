My Pet Goat II
by Michael in New York  on 7/27/2004 10:47:00 PM
George Bush is reading another book! The man who famously said he
doesn't bother with newspapers (too much possibility of discoveringsomething that challenges or just plain confuses you) is now reading
a new book. According to USA Today, Bush spokeswoman Claire
Buchan said he is currently reading the 9/11 commission's report.
It's sad but true that we had to be told this (rather than just assume
it) and even sadder that it's actually surprising. (Dick Cheney says
he's read "about half" of it.) Any bets on how far  Bush gets into the
800+ pages before giving up?
