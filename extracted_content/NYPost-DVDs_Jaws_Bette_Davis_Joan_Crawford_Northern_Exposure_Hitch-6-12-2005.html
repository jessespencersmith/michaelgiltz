The Bette Davis 
Collection/ 
Joan Crawford 
Collection ***'/'/*** Warner Bros., $49.92 each 
Hollywood's greatest rivalry 
continues with the same-day 
release of these boxed sets 
showcasing five movies 
apiece by Davis and Crawford, 
two gals who enjoyed a good 
fight. Davis wins this round, 
thanks to a better lineup of 
movies, including 1939's "Dark 
Victory," 1940's "The Letter" 
and 1942's "Now Voyager." 
Crawford's quality drops off 
after the classic 1939 catnip of 
"The Women" and 1945's 
"Mildred Pierce," but you still 
wouldn't want to bump into 
her in a dark alley. 
Northern· Exposure: 
Third Season 
* Universal, $5:.:9:..::.9:.::8=---___ _ 
One of TV's quirkiest, most 
delightful series gets shoddy 
treatment on DVD. "Season 
One" included all the original 
music - a must for serious 
fans, especially for a show 
that featured- a deejay and 
prided itself on eclectic, 
carefully chosen tunes. But 
season two and now season 
three sometimes substitute 
generic instrumentals or other 
tunes for songs they either 
didn't want to pay for or 
couldn't be bothered to get Jaws lOth 
Anniversary 
Edition ...... * 
Universal, $22.98 
Apparently, every five 
years they're going to 
release a special edition 
of "Jaws." If you don't 
already own this classic 
suspense film, you'll get 
a lavish booklet, a very 
good making-of 
documentary, deleted 
scenes, and more. If you 
already own one of· 
director Steven 
Spielberg's best movies, 
you might wait for the 
35th anniversary; maybe 
that one will finally 
include a commentary 
track from Spielberg, or 
at least the shark. 
clearance on. Cutting corners 
like this only infuriates the 
faithful and hurts a fine 
show's legacy. 
Hitch 
** Sony, $28.95 
Embarrassing. That's the 
only way to describe 
Hollywood's reluctance to 
give Will Smith a romantic 
comedy, despite a decade as 
one of the biggest stars in the 
world. He finally got "Hitch," 
a mild vehicle (stolen by 
Kevin James of "The King of 
Queens") about a smooth 
adviser who helps hapless 
men with romance. As always, 
Smith easily proved doubters 
wrong, for "Hitch" was a 
massive hit here ($177 million) 
and overseas, where "black" 
films are supposed to be duds.</p>
