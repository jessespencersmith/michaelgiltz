10/06/2004 02:36:00 PMThe LA Times does a great breakdown of how Cheney lied when hesaid he'd never met John Edwards before. They've got photos of thetwo together at a prayer breakfast ("inconsequential" squeaksCheney's people), describes Edwards escorting Elizabeth Dole to theSenate floor so she could be sworn in by Cheney.But they go further than the "he said, he said" usual stuff and putCheney's claims in context to show how he really lied."Although Cheney is the Senate's presiding officer, he actually sits inthe chamber only on rare occasions," says the LA Times, "such as tobreak a tie vote and to swear in new senators."Or to swear AT senators, we might add."He does attend the GOP senators' weekly luncheons to discuss partystrategy," continues LAT. "But only Republicans attend, and Cheneyusually breezes into the building, goes to the meeting, then leaveswithout hobnobbing with Democrats.In fact, Cheney was teased bySen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) for only associating with Republicanswhen, in an encounter on the Senate floor, Cheney cursed at Leahy."
