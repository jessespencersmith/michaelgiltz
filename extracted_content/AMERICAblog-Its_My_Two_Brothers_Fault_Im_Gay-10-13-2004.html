10/13/2004 01:43:00 AMAn interesting article in UK's Independent looks at a study that offersone explanation why a genetic predisposition to being gay doesn'tsimply die out since gay men are naturally quite a bit less likely tohave children.It found that there may also be an advantage to that gene sincefemale relatives of gay men (related by their mother) were far morelikely to have larger families. Therefore, if you're carrying that gene,the boys might be more likely to be gay but the girls will have abigger brood.But here was the kicker at the bottom I wasn't familiar with:"Scientists have also demonstrated repeatedly that the chance of aman being a homosexual rises by about a third for each older brotherhe has. They found that a man with three older brothers was abouttwice as likely to be gay as a man with none. This suggests that theremay be biological factors operating within the womb of a woman whohas already given birth to a number of sons that increase thepredisposition towards her next son being gay."So apparently, it's the fault of my two older brothers that I'm gay.Who knew?
