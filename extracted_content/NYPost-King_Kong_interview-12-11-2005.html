            <p>The Hot Seat 
• I 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
WITH Wednesday's premiere 
of the blockbuster "King 
Kong," the big ape has never 
been hotter. In a worldwide 
exclusive, the New York Post talks 
with the world's most famous simian 
star and discusses his career, those 
rumors about Fay Wray, fellow animal 
actors like Lassie and his plans for the 
future. 
Q_The original 1933 "King Kong" just 
-came out on DVD with-loads of 
extras. But you were noticeably absent. 
Did they ask you to take part? 
A-That was unfortunate. You know, 
_I never made any money off of 
the original "Kong" -$50 a day and 
all the bananas you could eat seemed 
like a good deal then. And of course 
they'll make a bundle on the DVD, 
The studio asked me to do one of 
those commentaries, but we couldn't 
agree on a price. It's too bad, but why 
should I do somethin g for nothing? 
Q_HOW does it feel to return to the 
-role that made you famous? For 
years after the disastrous 1976 version, 
you swore you'd never do it again. 
A-It's like that James Bond 
.saying. "Never say never 
again." Look. this is the ong 
A:TheY're both consummate 
professionals. Those Page Six 
rumors about me and Fay, by the way, 
were a studio publicist's idea. We 
were just friends. But some theater 
chains in the South even refused to 
show the movie because of it. 
Q-YOU're the consummate animal 
-actor, the first one to get top 
billing and a star on Hollywood's Walk 
of Fame. What do you think of your 
contemporaries? Flipper? Lassie? 
A_Flipper is a sweetheart -just as 
.nice as everyone says. Lassie ... 
Lassie does great work but she is very. 
very difficult to deal with. Frankly, 
she's a bitch and everyone knows it. 
Q_Your groundbreaking deal on 
-1949's "Mighty Joe Young" was the 
first time an animai actor got paid like a 
human actor -and getting a piece of 
the toy sales was prescient and long 
before George Lucas and "Star Wars." 
AJimmy Stewart always gets credit 
_for taking a lower salary in 
exchange for a cut of the box office 
when he made those 'SOs westerns . 
But animals were starting so far 
behind humans in terms of pay that I 
think my deal was more of a 
landmark. And "Mighty Joe Young" 
was a great chance for me to play 
a hero. The '98 remake 
by the way was huge "Hamlet" of animal 
stories. and I'm a 
much better actor 
now than when [ 
was a kid. '~~~1~'1~fA~_ ........... overseas and on U DVD. You 
Q-HOW 
-does 
Naomi 
Watts 
compare to 
FayWraY? could teil 
Charlize 
[Theron, 
his co­
star] was 
really 
going 
places. 
THE GREAT 
APE: Kong 
relaxes In a 
Guccl blazer 
outside his 
Malibu 
compound. Q_Your biggest regret has always 
-been the first "Planet of the Apes." 
A:! was born to play Cornelius! 
Q_Adding insult to injury, the main 
-roles were played by humans in 
makeup - a sort of simian equivalent 
to blackface, something you've strongly 
condemned over the years. 
A_Monkeyface, we call it. It·s 
_demeaning. With so many 
talented simians to choose from, why 
would they use humans? 
Q_Did director Tim Burton approach 
eyou about the 2001 remake? 
A:weU, I can't say they mad e me an 
offer. But they did send me the 
script. If I'd been interested, they 
would have been interested. 
Q:so what happened? 
A:! read the script. 
• Q==~I~: Godzilla always said you 
A:GOd Zilla? What's she been saying? 
Q:She? Godzilla is a guy. 
A_Sure. But have you seen "Godzilla 
_vs. Mothra" with those singing 
girls and that dance sequence? 
Campy, campy, campy. Besides. does 
he have to trash every village he 
comes across? Couldn't he just walk 
around them once in a while? Talk 
about overcompensating. 
Q:Are you saying Godzilla is gay? 
A:NO comrnenL 
Q:so what are your future plans? 
A_Well, MTV wants to do a reality 
_series about my life, sort of a 
cross between "The Osbourn es" and 
"Wild Kingdom" I guess. But I'rn,not 
sure I want to go that route. This!' 
movie is going to be huge -have you 
seen the reviews? Variety ment\llj:jed 
"Titanic"-level box office -andJ ~ 
want to keep up the quality. We're.: 
talking with HBO about an all-aiiUnal 
series -"The Sopranos" set in a;)' 
jungle. And rill really excited fcii,-WY 
nephew. He's got "Curious George" 
coming out in February. I've seen a 
rough cut and he is terrific. 
Q:Any Oscar buzz? 
A-Well, you know how prejudiced 
_the Academy is against animal 
actors. Sure, we've received a few 
honorary Oscars over the years, but 
not one animal actor has ever been 
nominated for best actor or actress. 
Isn't that ridiculous? If the movie is 
nominated, I don't even know if I'll go 
to the ceremony. 
Q_so you don't think you have a 
-chance with this movie? 
A_No. it's a remake and it'll make 
_too much money. Now if I could 
ever get that biopic of Koko the 
Gorilla made, I'd be a shoo-in for at 
least a nomination . It's the best script 
I've ever read. 
Q_What's your biggest complaint 
-about success? 
A_People screaming whenever they 
.see you. Sometimes you just 
want a quiet night on the town, you 
know. Then, when p~ople notice you, 
they get hysterical and make a big 
deal of it. Next thing you know. the 
National Guard gets involved, and 
it's a whole thing.</p>
