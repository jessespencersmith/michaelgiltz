8/27/2005 03:44:00 PMOne of the nastiest traits of Bush and his cronies is cynicallyusing the death and/or capture of brave American soldiers forpartisan political purposes -- and they don't care if it meanslying to the soldier's family and friends to do it. They did it withJessica Lynch and they did it again with Cpl. Pat Tillman, theformer pro football player who died from friendly fire. Themilitary lied about that to his family and the country toencourage support for Bush's unnecessary war and pushrecruitment. An Army investigation determined they knewwithin days how Tillman died but kept it a secret and shreddedevidence. Still, no coverup here. Really? The Pentagon is nowinvestigating that investigation. Don't you hate it when factskeep coming out?
