JaA MAN OF MANYWORDS
reelance journalist and author Joshua
Kendall is a self-confessed "word nerd."
So Kendall, 48, is the ideal author to
tackle the story of Peter Mark Roget
in ft k mo fnae lS: l.rle Ec!ilt,
ttramlq rrl fhqeer Cb|nfs
ficerd (Rrtnen $25.95).
An Engdish scholar, Roget's insights on
hurnan vision played a role in the irwention
of the movies. His instinct for organizing
knowledge resulted in acclaimed works.
His masterBiece, Roget's Thesaurus, is a
reference that became so popular his name
is now synonymous with synonyms.
With your strong background in
psychology, rvere you drawn to the life
of Roget in part because of the suicide,
madnesJand depression that stalked
his family and friends?That was certainly enticing. I have a piece
in this month's Psychology Today about
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
- people who are obsessed with rules and
lists and have a strong moral sense. Roget
had that obsessionality. There was all this
madness around him and he had his own
touch of madness, but he found this perfect
solution, wNch was to channel his energy
into Ihis thesaurus].
I never used a thesaurus as a k'rd
because I thought sf it as dreating.
Roget wanted to help you think about
things more deeply. He didn't want to give
you a shortcut. Sylvia Plath called herself
Roget's strumpet.
Roget was a pretty dull kid -
withdrawn, few friends, staying in hisloom making lists.
I loved his adolescent diary. He himself
had problems saying what he meant. That
was one of my most exciting finds. Oh my
God, this guy needs a thesaurus!
He dill llen a transfionnatbn and
becane a liuely daRcer, a ooawrsatlonal-
ist and om of the mo6t ellidHe badrelors
h londen. How did t|tb happen?
I think basically he got away from his
mother. [Laughs.] After his uncle [committed
suicidel, Roget's mother went crazy, but that
somehow freed up Roget to build up his own
life.
What's your fayodte synonym for the
word 'thesaurus?"
Let's see. "Treasure house," I think.
