9/07/2004 06:33:00 PMWe're not talking about 2000, we're talking about 2004.First the New York Times wrote an editorial today stating thathundreds if not thousands of Florida voters were denied the right tovote during the recent primaries because they didn't have photo IDs-- even though Florida law states voters needn't have suchidentification (not unusual for elderly voters, the poor and especiallypoor minorities who don't have cars). It wasn't just a mistake by afew bad poll workers. Osceola County printed up sample ballotswrongly claiming photo IDs were required.Then, the St. Pete Times had a story about groups trying to registervoters and/or change people's party affiliations. Some people told"volunteers" they were already registered but were informed theyhad to do so again. Their party affiliation was changed from Democratto independent and they were unable to vote in the primary. Otherincompetent nonprofit groups like ACORN held onto people's formsuntil after the deadline for the primaries and then apologized. Theseactions affected THOUSANDS more.And of course there's been little or no followup by the national mediaabout Bob Herbert's NYT editorial about the state police being used tointimidate elderly black voters in Orlando. Nor any serious falloutfrom the state official overseeing the election compiling faulty voterrolls that just happened to disenfranchise thousands of eligible votersbut keep ineligible Hispanic felons (who tend to vote Republican) onthe rolls.Why isn't widespread funny business in the state where our lastPresidential election was embroiled in controversy front page newsuntil this mess gets cleared up? The liberal news media certainly isn'tliving up to its name.
