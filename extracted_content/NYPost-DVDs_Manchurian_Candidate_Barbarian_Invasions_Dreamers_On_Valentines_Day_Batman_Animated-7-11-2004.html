This JJVeek's DVDs B~MICHAElGllTZ 
~ The Manchurian candidate *** * 
z MGM, $14.95 
Director Jonathan Demme's ill-advised remake comes out July 30. 
He better hope few people watch director John l'rankenheimer's 
crackerjack 1962 original, ill which Laurence Harvey is a Korean 
vet brainwashed into assassinating a presidential candidate. It's a 
career peak fot everyone, including Frank Sinatra (above) and 
Angela Lansbury. So-so extras include an audio commentary. 
The Barbarian 
Invasions 
***'/2 
Miramax, $29.99 
"The Barbarian Invasions" is a 
sequel that surpasses the 
original. "Barbarian" is the 
Oscar-winning follow-up to 
writer-director Denys Arcand's 
1986 drama "The Decline of the 
American Empire," in which 
liberal Canadians gleefully 
mock the u.s. Now older and 
wiser, the friends come 
together when one of them is 
dying to share a fmal goodbye. 
The Dreamers 
* Fox,$29.98 
Director Bernardo Bertolucci's 
inept look at three young 
people frolicking during the 
1968 Paris riots is simply not 
explicit enough. There's lots of 
nudity, but Bertolucci is too 
skittish to show gay sex or the 
threesome the entire film is 
heading toward. And Michael 
Pitt, who plays the innocent -
American, is too debauchechn 
actor for us to believe he could 
ever be "corrupted" by anyone. 
On Valentine's Day / 
1918 
***each 
Image, $19.99 each 
-~---
Here are two small, intimate' 
films by playwright and Oscar-winner Horton Foote ("Tender 
Mercies") about life in a small 
Texas town. Foote's daughter 
Hallie is marvelous as a young 
woman based on his mother. 
She defies her wealthy parents 
to marry her true love in "On 
Valentine's Day" (1986) and 
deals with the horror of an 
influenza outbreak in "1918" 
(1985). Matthew Broderick co­
stars, but Foote's quiet authority 
is front and center throughout. 
Batman: The 
Animated Series 
Volume One 
***'/2 
Warner Bros., $49.98 
Batman-the 
superhero 
without super 
powers -has 
been poorly 
served in 
movies and on 
TV. You've got 
the campy 
"Batman" series from the '60s, 
those bland "Super Friends" 
cartoon shows from the '70s 
and Tim Burton's visually 
striking but creatively bankrupt 
movies in the '80s and '90s. 
Here's the exception: This 1992 
animat,'d series has a 
sensational art-deco look, 
terrific voices (including Mark 
Hamill as the Joker), great 
music and the willingness to 
treat the Dark Knight seriously. 
Top-notch.</p>
