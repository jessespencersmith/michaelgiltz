8/10/2004 08:55:00 AMBush again puts partisan politics ahead of the fight on terror bynominating Porter Goss of Florida for the C.I.A. Both top Republicansand Democrats have been saying for weeks after his name had beenfloated that Goss was too partisan, too political and too controversiala choice to have the slightest chance of being nominated. That didn'tstop Bush, who'd rather choose someone that can stir up partisanpolitical fighting rather than someone of substance that both majorparties could quickly support so that we could get on with the war onterror.
