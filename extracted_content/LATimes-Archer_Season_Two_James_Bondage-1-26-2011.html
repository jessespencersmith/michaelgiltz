"Archer" (FX)‘Archer’: The sexed-up spy show returns
Thursday night on FX
Jan. 26, 2011  | 12:28 p.m.
Michael Giltz checks in with a
feature on “ Archer ,” the ribald FX
spy show that might just as well be
called “James Bondage.”
Start with the unflappable cool of
Matt Helm , add the rapid-fire
dialogue of “ Moonlighting ,” mix in
enough raunchy sex to make even the
cast of MTV’s “ Skins ” blush and
you’ve got “ Archer ,” the animated
comedy that begins its second seasonThursday at 10 p.m. on FX .
Emmy-nominated for the voice workof lead actor H. Jon Benjamin ,
Archer sprang from the mind ofcreator Adam Reed (“ Sealab
2021 ” and “ Frisky Dingo “) who
has given us a series about a spy,Sterling Archer , who pioneered the
tactical turtleneck, repeatedly shootsco-workers when they get on hisnerves, sleeps with his mom’ssecretary but refuses to remember hername (in retaliation, she keepschanging it) and says things like,
“Sure I crashed a few cop cars, rode
over a few mimes. I don’t play by therules, mother! But I get results!”
Really, though, the show was hatched
with just one basic idea in mind: “The

<p>genesis of Sterling Archer was trying to see how big of a jerk I could make a character and yet
you still root for him,” says Reed, who turns 41 just as Season 2 hits the air and is still waiting forhis batch of Season 1 DVDs  from Fox Home Entertainment . “You know a lot of it isn’t his
fault because his mother is such a mess. A lot of it is Jon Benjamin’s delivery; he can say themost horrible thing and it comes out … oddly charming.”
The same can be said of the entire series, which is basically a workplace comedy that just
happens to be set in a spy agency. Sterling Archer (a.k.a. “ Duchess ”) is the top field operative
and very good at his job (though we do get many flashbacks to Archer screwing up previous
missions).
His ex-girlfriend Lana (Aisha Tyler ) is Archer’s equal in every way as a field agent and now
dates the nerdy but well-endowed Cyril (Chris Parnell ). Archer’s mother ( Jessica Walter )
runs the agency ISIS when she isn’t busy trying to date the heads of almost every other spy
agency around the world.
This doesn’t begin to scratch the very adult surface of a show filled with the sexiest cartoon
characters ever shown on TV, who are often nude (with coyly placed objects to keep things all
basic cable), not to mention office drones who engage in constant sexual shenanigans involvingchoking, robotic arms and enough inappropriate overtures and blatant harassment to keep HRbusy for years.@LATHerocomplex

<p>“It’s a little dirty,” concedes Reed, a vast understatement for a show that can still make your jaw
drop in the post-” South Park ” world we live in. But FX has not been nearly as unnerved as you
might expect.
“They’re surprisingly cool,” Reed says. “The notes that we get back are few and far between. And
when there are [notes]  you can totally see their point. Usually the ones I remember [from past
projects] are eye-rollers, but I haven’t really had that with FX. Usually it’s, ‘Yeah, sorry. I shouldnever have written that.’”
The road through Season 1 was rocky, with a big premiere and then a slow slide in the ratings,
even as the network asked for more episodes and quotes like “Seriously, call Kenny Loggins ,
cause you’re in the danger zone” gained traction online.
"Archer" (FX)
“FX was very cool during the whole thing,” says Reed, who is based in Atlanta, where the entire
series is made and animated. “They said, ‘Don’t worry. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. About
midseason, they said, ‘We do hope however that we’ve found the floor.’ Then, for whateverreason — word of mouth — it ticked back up and just cleared the bar for a second season. We had10 weeks to chew our fingernails down to the quick.”
After just a few weeks off, they launched into production of Season 2. “I am writing number 11,”
Reed says. “They ordered 13. We are recording Episode 10 starting tomorrow. Episode 9 is beingstoryboarded … well, storyboards being placed against the audio. There’s a lot of overlap. I justwent to the mix for No. 7 on Friday. And No. 8 is somewhere getting animated, I guess. It’s hardfor me to keep track. I always have to be reminded of what episode we’re talking about. We havea staff of about 40 very talented young animators in a great big studio in the woods. I’m lookingat them right now, hunched over their tablets drawing furiously.”Caprica  Captain America  Charles Burns

Report
Reed got his start at Turner Networks , where he met his collaborator and Archer’s executive
producer, Matt Thompson . They were in charge of the library and used to take old cartoons
home, drink beer and watch episodes of TV shows people hadn’t seen since the 1960s. “First day
on the job, I walked in fresh-faced and eager to work, I met [Matt] and he said, ‘Come on, we’regetting out of this place. I’ll tell you the ins and outs so you don’t have to work too hard.’”
So suddenly a kid who rarely read comics or watched cartoons but spent most of his childhood
dreaming of becoming a private eye like on “ Simon & Simon ” or “ Magnum P.I .” found
himself in the world of cartoons. That led to their “ What’s Up, Tiger Lily ”-like spin on the old
cartoon “Sealab 2021,” “Frisky Dingo” and now “Archer.”
Reed is coy about Season 2 but offers up these tidbits: somebody at ISIS has fathered an
illegitimate baby, Archer and Lana go on missions to Gstaad and Louisiana, Archer’s manservantWoodhouse gets an origin story episode, and late in the season Archer gets a love interest. And
you can expect catty comments from co-workers like Pam, the dumpy HR manager who wants
to sleep with anyone and everyone, or Gillette , the sassy gay worker who gets on like
gangbusters with Lana but can’t stand Archer.
Reed created the role of Gillette just so he could get back to performing.
“I did the voice of the hero and the villain in ‘Frisky Dingo,’” says Reed. “I missed not getting in
the booth and goofing around and subsequently getting paid for it. So I essentially wrote Gilletteinto the scripts. My girlfriend gets unnerved when she watches the cuts of me doing Gillette. She
says, ‘That sounds really authentic. Go grill something.’”
