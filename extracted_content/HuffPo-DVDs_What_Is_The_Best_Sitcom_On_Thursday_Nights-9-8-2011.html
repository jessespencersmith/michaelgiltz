 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: What's The Best Sitcom On
Thursday Nights?
What's the best sitcom airing on Thursday nights? In the fall, two new shows -- How To Be A Gentleman
and Whitney  -- will try to join what has often been the best night for comedy on TV. Right now, the king
of the night is The Big Bang Theory,  at least according to the Nielsen ratings. Can any of these NBC
sitcoms claim to be better creatively?

<p>THE OFFICE SEASON SEVEN  ($49.98 DVD and $59.98 BluRay; Universal)
COMMUNITY SECOND SEASON  ($39.99; Sony)
PARKS AND RECREATION SEASON THREE  ($39.98; Universal) -- I wish The Office  had ended its
run this year with the goodbye to Michael Scott (and the actor playing him, Steve Carrell). It would have
been a solid finale for a good show I thought should never have been made. I was wrong -- though it can'thold a classic to the absolutely brilliant UK original, the American Office  found its own path. It took them
two seasons and it's outstayed its welcome, but they did it. Too bad they can't make a graceful farewell.
Community  is a good second-tier sitcom a la WKRP In Cincinnati  or Family Ties.  These sort of sitcoms
get by on the chemistry of their cast more than great writing and that's certainly the case with this quirky
led by Joel McHale. And then there's Parks and Recreation . It took Amy Poehler three seasons to get the
mix right, but they've fiddled and fiddled with the tone and the style and the cast and finally hit thejackpot with the likes of Rob Lowe. It's the sleeper success story that for the moment has most insidersbelieving it's the best show of the night. What do you think? (By the way, if it's not cheating, I'd sayArcher .)

<p>THE COMPLETE JEAN VIGO  ($29.95 DVD and $39.95 BluRay; Criterion)
IF....  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- It's kind of sad but accurate to call this collection of shorts and one
feature film "The Complete Jean Vigo." Hollywood has a cult for great actors who died young like James
Dean. Is there any other director with such marvelous promise as Vigo, who was cut down by TB at 29years old? This beautifully restored collection -- you'd expect no less from Criterion -- includeseverything you could want. Taris  is a 9 minute nothing, an offhand look at a swimmer. A Propos De Nice
is a more substantial 23 minute essay/slice of life from the city of the same name. Most intriguing of allis Zero De Conduite,  a 44 minute tale of students rebelling at a boarding school, making it a fascinating
precursor to If....  But above all there is L'Atalante,  made in the same year as Zero  (1933). One of the most
beautiful, romantic films of all time, it tells the simple story of young lovers on a canal barge. L'Atalanteremains one of the greatest films of all time and a tantalizing hint of what might have been. The others,especially Zero , prove Vigo's success was no fluke and he was clearly growing by leaps and bounds. The
bountiful extras include a great booklet, alternate edits, audio commentaries, a trifle of an animatedhomage by Michel Gondry and especially a TV chat about Vigo between Francois Truffaut and apompously self-important Eric Rohmer. Also just out on Criterion is If....,  Lindsay Anderson's classic tale
of anarchy at a British boarding school from 1969. By all rights, this film should seem dated andhopelessly of its period (the way Lord Of The Flies  has dated). Instead, led by Macolm McDowell's
magnetic lead performance, it's become a fable, a reckless cautionary tale that seems far more relevantthan many of the kitchen-sink dramas that came out of England in the previous decade. Loads of extras,including McDowell on audio commentary and from a making-of special, as well as Anderson's
documentary about a school for the deaf which makes an odd, but intriguing double bill.

<p>X-MEN: FIRST CLASS  ($29.98 DVD and $39.98 BluRay: FOX) -- Is the fifth film in the X-Men
franchise a success? Let's look at the numbers. it cost the most to make ($160 million) and made the
least money in North America. (Worldwide, it's the second-lowest grossing after the original.) Financially,with $353 million coming in to cover the budget and major advertising and expenses to launch a film like
this around the world, it's probably a wash, once you add in DVD and streaming and TV sales. But how
was the movie ? Here the news is much better. Director Matthew Vaughan delivered the best in the series
after the original. Following two positively dreadful movies -- X-Men: Final Stand  and X-Men Origins:
Wolverine  -- they took a franchise that was a dead man walking and made it viable and cool again. The
sexy young cast led by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender made the movie about how the team came
together fun and delivered by far the best standard of acting the series has yet to see. It may be a closecall for the accountants, but the surest proof that X-Men: First Class  got the job done is that we're going
to see another entry down the road.
POLICE STORY SEASON ONE  ($39.97; Shout) -- This show by novelist Joseph Wambaugh will
always deserve a place in TV history as one of the series that advanced the complexity and authenticitywith which cops were portrayed in prime-time. Hill Street Blues  and The Wire  both owe a debt to it. The
show was not based around certain cops, but an anthology series with new characters and storylinesevery week, sometimes delving into the big moments but just as often showing the drudgery that'sinvolved in fighting crime. Certain characters reappeared while others -- notably Angie Dickinson asPolice Woman,  a bigger hit -- got spun off into their own shows. This set contains all 21 episodes of the
first season which aired on NBC in the 1973-1974 season. Quality varies, of course, but it's a notable show
that deserves to be seen.

<p>HANNA  ($29.98 DVD and $34.98 BluRay; Universal) -- This nifty B movie with an A list cast is about a
young woman (Saoirse Ronan of Atonement ) raised in isolation by her father (Eric Bana) and trained to
be the world's best assassin. In comes Cate Blanchett as a ruthless agent to track the girl down as the kid
strives to complete her first mission. It wasn't quite embraced by critics or genre fans but they're going todiscover it now. Let the "cult" success buzz begin.
BASEBALL'S GREATEST GAMES: 1986 WORLD SERIES GAME 6  ($12.95; A&E/MLB) -- Three
new releases are just out in this series featuring some of the greatest games in baseball history. But twoof them involve Boston and the Twins actually succeeding. As a Yankee fan, I'm going to ignore them andfocus on this 1986 game between the New York Mets and the Boston Red Sox in which (spoilier!) theMets triumph. You get the entire 10 inning game, including Mookie's glorious roller up the first base line.The only extra is the ability to watch the DVD while substituting the Mets radio play-by-play. For thosewho wore out their VHS copy long ago, here it is again.
ALSO OUT THIS WEEK:
GAVIN & STACEY THE COMPLETE COLLECTION  ($79.98; BBC) -- Actor James Corden is having
the theatrical triumph of a lifetime starring in the UK hit comedy One Man, Two Guvnors.  But he's no
stranger to success, being part of the ensemble for The History Boys.  What I didn't know was that he also
co-starred, co-wrote and co-created the award-winning sitcom Gavin & Stacey  that charts a young
romance from first date to wedding and beyond. This set contains all 20 episodes from three seasons
(including a Christmas special). Pity it's a bit high-priced but critical acclaim should draw Anglophiles.
SCARFACE LIMITED EDITION  ($34.98 BluRay; Universal) -- Al Pacino's over-the-top performance
as a drug lord is beloved by gangsters and gangstas and rappers and would-be's in all those areas. This
typically overheated Brian DePalma film hasn't aged well but that's one no-holds-barred portrayal byPacino.
SIGMUND AND THE SEA MONSTERS SEASON ONE  ($29.93; SMK) Sid & Marty Krofft delivered
genuine oddity on TV like no one before or since. This show is about a boy (Johnny Whitaker) who
befriends a lovable sea monster and sings a song whenever he's feeling confused or blue. The show onlylasted for two seasons and 29 episodes, but this contains only season one, so don't get impatient when

<p>Rip Taylor doesn't pop in to throw one of his whammy spells.
DRESSED TO KILL  ($24.99; MGM) - Director Brian DePalma was once wildly overrated (see
Scarface , above). But his Alfred Hitchcock fixation paid off dividends at least once with this thriller
starring Michael Caine and Angie Dickinson. Dickinson was coming off her hit TV show Police Woman
and had every right to expect a better film career than she got.
FRINGE: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON  ($59.98 DVD and $69.97 BluRay; Warner Bros.) --
With some shows, it's nice to have the DVD set so you can watch the season again and revisit your
favorite episodes. With a twisty, confusing, densely written series like Fringe , it's positively essential for
parsing out exactly what the heck is going on in the multiverse of this sci-fi drama. Super nutty, but itkeeps holding on thanks to a devout fan base that will surely snap this up and start debating the plot
points all over again.
STRAW DOGS  ($24.99 BluRay; MGM) -- Just in time for the thoroughly unnecessary remake comes
the BluRay release of this complex revenge tale co-written and directed by Sam Peckinpah. It stars
Dustin Hoffman as a mousy fellow forced to defend his British bride, discovering the violent cavemanwithin. Only Hollywood would say, Hmm, who can take the role of Hoffman? How about...JamesMarsden? Of course!. Schlumpy everyman replaced by beautiful golden boy.
TWO AND A HALF MEN COMPLETE EIGHTH SEASON  ($44.98; Warner Bros.) -- I'm sure some
of the faithful will simply refuse to watch this show anymore now that Ashton Kutcher has stepped into a
lead role. But whatever your feelings, this is the end of Charlie Sheen's reign on the biggest sitcom hit ofthe past decade.
UNITED 93  ($26.98 BluRay; Universal) -- What might have been a trite TV movie of the week is turned
by writer-director Paul Greengrass into a thoughtful, moving, gripping and satisfying if emotionally
exhausting drama about the passengers on Flight 93 who rose up against their hijackers on September 11.With all the specials and rehashes of that day looming for the anniversary, you'd do well to simply watchthis movie and see tragedy respectfully turned into art.
