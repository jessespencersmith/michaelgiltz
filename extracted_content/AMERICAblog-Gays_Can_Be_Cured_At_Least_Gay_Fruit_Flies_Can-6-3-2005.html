6/03/2005 03:02:00 AMThat's a headline some have feared for years -- would sciencefind a "gay" gene? One that parents could search for and aborta fetus before it's born (the way people around the world abortbaby girls) or perhaps just "fix?' Many took comfort in theknowledge that scientists believed something as complex assexual orientation would be derived from many factors and notjust one lone gene.Well, the New York Times reports in an experiment on fruit flies...That one gene, the researchers are announcing today in thejournal Cell, is apparently by itself enough to createpatterns of sexual behavior - a kind of master sexual genethat normally exists in two distinct male and femalevariants.In a series of experiments, the researchers found thatfemales given the male variant of the gene actedexactly like males in courtship, madly pursuing otherfemales. Males that were artificially given the femaleversion of the gene became more passive and turnedtheir sexual attention to other males."We have shown that a single gene in the fruit fly issufficient to determine all aspects of the flies' sexualorientation and behavior," said the paper's leadauthor, Dr. Barry Dickson, senior scientist at theInstitute of Molecular Biotechnology at the AustrianAcademy of Sciences in Vienna. "It's very surprising."What it tells us is that instinctive behaviors can bespecified by genetic programs, just like themorphologic development of an organ or a nose."The results are certain to prove influential in debatesabout whether genes or environment determine whowe are, how we act and, especially, our sexualorientation, although it is not clear now if there is asimilar master sexual gene for humans.Humans are much more complicated, of course. And one should pointout these are FRUIT flies we're talking about, after all. But is this apositive development? (See, it is genetic!) Or is it negative? (See, itcan be cured!)Actually, it's neither -- it's simply an apparent advance inhuman knowledge, one that could be confirmed or clarified orproven misleading down the road. Yes, people can abusescience or jump to silly conclusions based on one study. Butonly fools fear finding out the world is round or circles the sunor that the earth is more than 50,000 years old, etc. Let's leavefear and hatred of science to the fundies.
