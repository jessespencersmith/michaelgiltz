ized everything from 
Ray Bans to ripped 
sweatshirts to wire­
haired fox terriers. So 
it should come as no surprise to 
soundtrack collectors that mov­
ies have also popularized differ­
ent types of music. Witness the 
following scores: 
• Black Orpheus (Verve) cap­
tured the excitement of Carnival 
in Rio and served as a 1959 call­
ing card for bossa nova. Making 
his debut was Antonio Carlos 
Jobim, a pioneer of this seduc­
tive Brazilian style, who would 
soon pen "The Girl From Ipan­
ema." The movie's score is a 
noisy, colorful collage of street 
sounds, the shouts of carnival 
partygoers, and such boss a nova 
classics as "Manha de Camava l." 
• The Harder They Come 
(Mango), a low-budget 1973 
film about life in Jamaica, intro­
duced a .generation of college lkidS to reggae with its infectious, 
memorable songs by Jimmy G u o 
Cliff ("You Can Get It If You 
Really Want," "Many Rivers to 
Cross"), the Maytals, and others. 
• American Graffiti (MCA) 
certainly didn't introduce any­
one to early rock 'n' roll. Its E 
Fifth Symphony and M us­
sorgsky's Night on Bald Moun­
tain) that one longs to consider 
tongue-in-cheek . 
• Singles (Epic) looks to capi­
talize on the "Seattle sound," 
bumper-to-bump­
er hits by such 
stars as Chuck 
Berry and Buddy 
Holly were as fa­
miliar as the cast 
(Harrison Ford, 
Richard Dreyfuss) 
was unfamiliar. 
But the movie is a 
landmark of the 
nostalgia craze, 
repackaging mu­
sic that was once 
a symbol of sexy, 
raucous rebellion 
into a reminder of SMELLS LIKE SEATTLE: SOUNDGARDEN. 
a sweet and innocent past. 
• Saturday Night Fever (Poly­
gram), perhaps today even more 
than in 1977, embodies the glory 
and shame of disco-irresistible 
singles ("Stayin' Alive," "If I 
Can't Have You"), interminable 
versions of bad songs (almost 
eight minutes of "Calypso 
Breakdown"), and bizarre adap­
tations of classics (Beethoven's the latest subgenre of rock 'n' 
roll. This soon-to-be-released 
Cameron Crowe film, more 
about single people than re­
corded singles, lined up a 
soundtrack of music from such 
hot Seattle bands as Pearl Jam, 
Soundgarden, and Alice in 
Chains long before Nirvana 
made their hometown smell 
like success. MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
