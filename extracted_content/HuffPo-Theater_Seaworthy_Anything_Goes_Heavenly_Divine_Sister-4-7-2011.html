 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Seaworthy "Anything
Goes;" Heavenly "Divine Sister"
ANYTHING GOES  ** 1/2 out of ****
STEPHEN SONDHEIM THEATRE
It's hard to go wrong with a sturdy musical theater vessel
like the Cole Porter classic Anything Goes.  But the
Roundabout comes close with the mildly pleasant revival
currently on Broadway, an indifferent affair saved
almost entirely by those buoyant songs. Undemandingsubscribers certainly won't feel cheated but this is not ashow anyone involved was driven to mount.
The story is as fluffy as they come. Reno Sweeney (Tony
winner Sutton Foster) is a good-time gal and nightclubsinger who has fallen hard for her pal Billy Crocker
(Colin Donnell). He's a young eager beaver on Wall Street who has half the women in New York ready toinvest in his portfolio. But Billy has unexpectedly fallen in love with the beautiful, out-of-his-league
debutante Hope Harcourt ( Grease  reality show winner Laura Osnes). She of course loves him back but
must marry the drippy but harmless Lord Evelyn Oakleigh (the very good Adam Godley) so that mother
(Jessica Walter) can stay ensconced in wealth. Meanwhile, Public Enemy No. 13 or so Moonface Martin(Tony winner Joel Grey) is evading the police and they all end up on a luxury liner headed to Londonduring which madcap hilarity ensues.

<p>It's all a very thin excuse for a string of great numbers like "I Get A Kick Out Of You," "You're The Top,"
"Easy To Love," "Friendship," "It's De-Lovely," "All Through the Night" and the two show-stoppers"Blow, Gabriel, Blow" and of course "Anything Goes." So you've got your usual luxury liner set with stairson both sides and three levels for the hoofers, some silly romance that's sure to come out alright and apassel of great tunes. What could go wrong? Plenty, actually,
Foster glides through the role of Reno with the charm and talent we expect. But Reno is a role you
steamroll your way through and that never happens here. One problem is she's paired with partners thatforce Foster to dial it down. Donnell is a handsome fella -- it's easy to see him making New York swoon --but he's never more than amiable and certainly doesn't wow with his vocals. In London, the charismatic
John Barrowman literally stole the show from Reno and made you think this musical was really about
Billy; no such luck here. Osnes is even more anonymous as the ingenue (admittedly not a role that offersmuch of an opportunity beyond looking pretty and "All Through The Night"). Jessica Stone is quiteamusing as Erma, but her big chance to shine -- "Buddie, Beware" -- also falls flat. Andrew Cao (so goodin the delightful musical Frog Prince ) is wasted in a minor role but has so much charisma you can easily
imagine him as an ideal Billy.
Even pros like Grey, Walter (currently doing Emmy-worthy work in Archer , the best sitcom on TV) and
John McMartin (as Eli Whitney) can't do more than get by. They're all let down by unimaginative sets,
costumes, direction and choreography. The set by Derek McLane is functional and little more, especiallyfalling short in the nightclub scene. The costumes by Martin Pakledinaz are also just good enough...andalso not sexy or flashy enough for that same scene featuring "Blow, Gabriel, Blow." The solid lighting byPeter Kaczorowski is a saving grace on the tech side.
Time and again the usually dependable director/choreographer Kathleen Marshall (who most recently
thrilled with her revival of The Pajama Game ) doesn't deliver. When Reno sings "I Get A Kick Out Of
You," Billy basically just sits there. When Grey delivers his inspirational comic moment "Be Like The BlueBird," all she can think to do with the prison set and Billy is to plunge it into darkness and again havehim sit there. "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" and the finale look more like traffic jams at times as she moves thelarge cast around the stage. Erma is a go-getter who chases every sailor in sight and has them dancing to
her tune -- so why is she handed around like a parcel during her one chance to shine on "Buddie?"
One could go on but it's more about missed opportunities than a disastrous night out. The gawky Godley
is amusing as the silly Brit, a happy reminder of why this show gets revived every few years. And whenFoster gets a chance to dance and sing her heart out on "Anything Goes" and the finale, you can't help butsmile. Cole Porter is the tops, after all.
THE DIVINE SISTER  *** 1/2 out of ****
SOHO PLAYHOUSE
I just got a chance to catch the latest Charles Busch comedy The Divine Sister  at the Soho Playhouse
before it closes at the end of the month. Everyone told me it's his best in years and they're right. The
story is the usual foolishness -- a Catholic school is about to go bankrupt and Mother Superior mustconvince the wealthy, widowed, fervently atheistic Jewess down the road to pony up the funds. Plus

<p>there's a suspicious new German nun who seems to be embroiled in a plot twist from The Da Vinci Code
and a nun-in-training who hears voices and can heal the wounded.
The trick is that this 90 minute comedy is tightly plotted and delivered with verve by a cast that straddles
that delicious line between out of control lunacy and a genuine affection for their nutty characters. Alison
Fraser is hilarious as the German nun and Busch stalwart Jennifer Van Dyck is just splendid as theJewish widow Mrs. Levinson. She nails the very specific but over-the-top style that somehow makes thiswork. Carl Andress directs with cool efficiency and keeps everyone on the same page (not an easy task ina show that tempts one to chew the scenery). At the center of it all of course is Busch, who wrote thiswitty work and performs it with relish and a subtlety that's rarely appreciated. He's inspired so manyimitators who have delivered so many similar but markedly inferior works that you can forget how goodit can be. Rush to see The Divine Sisters s before it closes and you'll know: this is how it's done.
