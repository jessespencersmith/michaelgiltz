Grammy Preview: The Actual Best Albums Of 2015
 02/12/2016 03:50 pm ET  | Updated  Feb 15, 2016

Hey, the Grammys are no better or worse than the Oscars or the Emmys
or the National Book Awards. They rarely pick your actual favorite
album/movie/TV show/book of the year. But give them credit: for the last
few years, out of the nominations they made, the Grammys have actuallybeen picking ones I liked a lot.
Arcade Fire won in 2011 (I would have been happy with Eminem, too),
Adele beat a sad lot in 2012, Mumford & Sons won in 2013 (Frank Oceanwould have been cooler, but still), Daft Punk had their moment in 2014,and Beck's excellent Morning Phase  topped another sad lot in 2015.
So come February 15, I actually have high hopes that Kendrick Lamar'sbrilliant To Pimp A Butterfly  will be awarded Album Of The Year. Heck,
most critics would agree it's the best of the year and the Grammys and
the critics rarely  agree. (And if it's an upset, I'd be thrilled with Chris
Stapleton's Traveller ; less so with Alabama Shakes - but please, no Taylor
Swift or The Weeknd.)
Yes, two of the albums nominated for Grammy's top prize are actually in
my top 5 for the best albums of the year. So to celebrate music's bignight, here's a list of my favorite albums of the year, followed by some
early ear candy from 2016 and then a brief rundown of what I love about
each album and a video for the Top 10 so you can check them out. (Forthe rest, you know, go to YouTube.) Enjoy!

THE BEST ALBUMS OF 2015 - THE LINER NOTES1. SUFJAN STEVENS  - Carrie & Lowell  My year in music began very well
indeed, with several albums blowing me away. Then this came out and I
said to myself, "It's over." To my shock, it didn't even appear on RollingStone's list of the 50 Best Albums of 2015, when of course it should have
been #1. At least it was in the Top 10 and the Village Voice's vaunted
Pazz And Jop poll. (If you're wondering, I've heard most everything on theRS list and much in the Top 100 of the Pazz poll.) Maybe you're notfamiliar with Stevens? He delivered what is widely considered one of the
best albums of the 2000s: Come On Feel The Illinoise,  a sprawing,
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink masterpiece as ambitious and exciting
and diverse in style and form as one could ask. This is it's polar opposite.I first heard it under ideal conditions: driving in a car, late at night on a
darkened highway with no idea of what it was like other than "the new
Sufjan Stevens." Turns out it's a 3 in the morning, Nick Drake sort of
album, fragile and quiet and when it was finished, I thought, "Well,
somebody died!" Lyrically, musically, emotionally, the Angel of Deathhovers over this one and blesses it with the beat of its wings. Turns outthe mother of Stevens did in fact die and this album grapples with that.
Becoming an orphan (or a semi-orphan if your other parent is still alive) is
always notable. But Stevens reportedly had a complicated relationshipwith her, to say the least. It's a testament to the work that I didn't knowany of this but felt churned up emotionally, almost holding my breath at
certain songs, afraid to break the spell. It's no less sonically ambitious
than Illinoise  but that boldness is far more subtle here. Stevens and the
people recording with him do remarkable things here with analog, the
hiss of audio, the textures  of recording that others can appreciate and
break down better than me. All I know is listening to the album is a
transfixing experience. Is it depressing? Not at all. Any art that tackles</p>
<p>deep, dark issues and can produce a lasting work is to me a joyful act,
however sad the story at hand. Illinoise  was hailed with hosannas the
moment it arrived. This one will grow in stature and endure. It's a thing of
rare beauty.
2. JILL SCOTT  - Woman  I think I love Jill Scott. She's smart and sexy
and frank and funny and her new album is just the latest to declare her
brilliance at picking up where Prince left off. "Closure" makes me laugh
every time I listen to it but the pleasures to be had are many: gospel,
blues, pop, soul, spoken word, the personal and the political. It's all hereand all good. How many more excellent albums does she have to create
before people wake up to her talent?
3. KENDRICK LAMAR  - To Pimp A Butterfly  This is it, the album anointed
the best of the year by the critics and - who knows - maybe even the
Grammys on Monday. It's a stellar follow-up to Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City.Lamar took the success of that album and ran with it, working in live</p>
<p>musicians, jazz, soul, pop and pretty much everything else you can think
of into his "state of the union" masterpiece. No, let's not call it his
masterpiece because I think he's just getting started? You've beendigging the cast album to Hamilton, marveling at how hip-hop canilluminate the complexity of America back in 1776? Check this out to hear
how it illuminates America in 2016.
4. CHRIS STAPLETON  -- Traveller  -- What are they drinking in Nashville.
Every year seems to bring up a new winner for Sturgill Simpson in 2014 to
this absolute killer album in 2015. Unlike Simpson, the wheel remains the
same -- no reinvention here. Just great songs, great musicianship, great
singing. Except for the maudlin "Daddy Doesn't Pray Anymore" -- a
traditional country tune in the bad sense, right down to the "surprise"twist at the end -- this is a sheer pleasure.
5. THE TALLEST MAN ON EARTH  - Dark Bird Is Home  It's been a
decade now that I've been digging this artist, a guy from Sweden who</p>
<p>sings in English, plays the guitar with flair, digs Dylan and Guthrie, has a
folkie vibe and yet from the start has followed his own melodic, rock and
roll heart. I can't say he keeps getting better because he started out
sensationally good. But he has been slowly, gently expanding his musicalrange. First it seemed like it was just him and a guitar. An EP followed by
an album and then another EP and then another album, each one
opening up to a fuller sound without ever sacrificing the pure lyricism thathas struck a chord with fans worldwide. This growth has been so gradualthat when his new album includes a full band and the first track opens up
wider and wider with sound it feels like a movie that suddenly expands
into Panavision. (See Xavier Dolan's Mommy  for the cinematic idea I'm
driving at.) Really, it's not that radical: if you're new to him, you'll just heara terrific, lovely, actually rather restrained work of folkish rock and roll
bursting with great tunes, incisive lyrics and winning vocals, always
anchored by his sterling guitar work. For long time fans like myself, it'slike being launched into space. Catch him before he goes into orbit.
6. COURTNEY BARNETT  - Sometimes I Just Sit And Think And
Sometimes I Just Sit  As good as it is, I'm a little wary of this. The poor
woman had barely released an EP when she was being dubbed the new
Dylan. This debut album was immediately clobbered with hype that saidwe could now expect decades of brilliant work from this amazing artist.
Leave her alone! Can't we just let her actually produce some music first
before shoving Joni Mitchell and Neil Young aside in the pantheon ofgreats? Truth be told, humor has never been a valued commodity in rockand roll and Barnett is hilarious. So her immediate acceptance is
welcome. She's got a deadpan delivery and some really amusing lyrics
and a beguiling guitar style that's so direct you'd think it was indirect, ifthat makes any sense. I'm not sure how much this music will bear
repeating but it sure was a hoot on first blush. It's compelling, strange,
wonderfully weird and all that. I'm just worried the next album will be</p>
<p>compelling, strange and wonderfully weird in all the same ways, a la a
one-trick pony. There's no denying it's hugely effective but I'd like to
delay the coronation for a while, please. Now let her tour and develop and
let's see what she comes up with next.
7. TONY BENNETT AND BILL CHARLAP  - The Silver Lining  One of the
greats, Tony Bennett has sold more albums, won more Grammys and
made more new fans as a senior citizen than he ever did before. The pityis that most of his recent albums can't hold a candle to his best. Even
though I was tickled as much as anyone to see him on MTV Unplugged,
that live album was not the artistic peak of his career. And I shudder tothink many fans own Duets  and nothing else. Still, his album with kd lang
back in 2002 was a gem. And now we've got another one to celebrate.This collaboration with pianist Bill Charlap of course harkens back to oneof the absolute peaks in his recording career: the two albums Bennett didwith the great Bill Evans. This delight is damn near as good as those and
those are about as good as Bennett gets. They're paying tribute to
Jerome Kern and while his voice may be rough with age, he can zero inon a lyric like nobody's business. Charlap (who has done the same on
two great albums with his mom, singer Sandy Stewart) is an accompanist
who can swing and provides an ideally sympathetic partner for Bennett.The irony is that Bennett has been so lauded in recent years that nowwhen he really does deserve the Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album, he
may get overlooked. Don't you do the same.</p>
<p>8. THE FRATELLIS  - Wide Eyed Tongue Tied  Hey guys, my bad. Sorry I
lost track of you. You're one of the best Scottish rock bands around.
Scratch that - you're one of the best rock bands around, period. I was
crazy about your debut album Costello Music ...and then you slipped from
view. Side projects, a band hiatus and three albums later, I finally caught
up with you and this faultless CD reminded me exactly why I went nuts
the first time around. Now if you'll just come to town, I can finally see youin concert. I promise, I won't forget.
9. IRIS DEMENT  - The Trackless Woods  Okay, it's an unlikely project, I
guess and Dement has had a fitful, wandering career. She burst onto the
folk scene from Arkansas, with a voice so big it was almost startling and
sterling songwriting that immediately caught the ear of everyone from the
folks on Northern Exposure  to the band 10,000 Maniacs, which covered
her. Her second album won me from the opening track "Sweet Is The
Melody" and never let go. She was on A Prairie Home Companion . She
received acclaim. Then she recorded an overtly political album and --
never one for the star-making machinery -- Dement stepped away. Some16 years later, she reappeared with a marvelous album of originals
because she'd had a family and it was time. So to capitalize on that
momentum, she has now put out an album of songs using lyrics pulledfrom the Russian poetry of Anna Akhmatova. Of course! Others translatedthe poems, Dement set them to music and recorded it with piano and</p>
<p>some modest guitar accompaniment. It's out on her own record label
because everyone else probably thought she was plumb crazy. Well, it
works a dream. Her melodies seem wedded to the words as if they wereborn together. The songs have a dark beauty Dement seems to have
been preparing to capture her entire career. It's strangely foreign and yet
familiar at the same time. If you've ever had the slightest interest inDement, give a listen. You'll be searching out her other CDs and the workof this giant of Russian poetry as soon as it's ended.
10. IKE REILLY  -- Born On Fire  I could pretend I know all about Ike Reilly
but the truth is that this rock and roll gem just blew me away and I had to
play some serious catch-up on this talented artist who's apparently been
turning out some damn good music for years with me being none thewiser. Hell, I'm playing the title track while I write this and it's so good I'm
getting a contact high even though it's the 20th or so time I've spun it
lately and that joint should be dead by now. It's a positively heart-warming ode to Reilly's child and it should be piped into every newbornnursery in every hospital in the world. I hear Springsteen, I hear John
Hiatt, but mostly I hear a veteran act burning with great songs, great
talent and a great hunger to get it down on tape long after a lesser manmight have given up in the face of inattention. It's raucous, catchy,
exhilarating and kicks ass. Think a rowdier Bring The Family . Now where
can I buy all those earlier Ike Reilly albums, pronto?</p>
<p>11. KAMASI WASHINGTON  - The Epic  Jazz? Jazz. Other than vocalists,
I've sorely lost the thread when it comes to the best jazz artists working
out there right now. Much of the blame is my own, but certainly jazz hassimply not commanded the attention of even the cognoscenti for a whilenow, however deserving individual acts might be. It takes a major talent
to wake up the world to the ever-vital artistry that jazz can embody. Enter
tenor saxophonist and composer Kamasi Washington, who has suchundeniable chops he looks set to single-handedly demand folk dig jazzagain. His album is a 3 CD epic in every sense and it deserves every
accolade it's received. It makes me almost ashamed to think of the jazz
albums of the last few years I've missed out on. It's sprawling, all-embracing and just plain fun, covering the waterfront by including
everything from 70s funk soundtrack to Coltrane's spirituality to Louis
Armstrong's concise swing. Caveat: each album has one vocal track (I'mnot including the spoken word track in this assessment) and they're notjust up to the level of the other music - no, they are positively dreadful. It's
as if someone just slapped in some god-awful music from another planet
just to mess with us. What is up with them? They're easily ignored andsurely everyone will skip them the second, third and one hundredth timethey play this album. Washington is the shape of things to come in jazz
and happily we're all paying attention now.
12. BOZ SCAGGS  - A Fool to Care  Scaggs has been in the zone lately,
with two excellent albums of standards followed by Memphis and now A
Fool To Care, nominally a New Orleans-inspired work. Like his best work
since the commercial peak of Silk Degrees, it's so casually good youalmost don't realize that until suddenly you've spun it 10 or 20 times and
it keeps getting better.
13. KACEY MUSGRAVES  - Pageant Material  Country artist Musgraves
doubles down on her solid debut Same Trailer, Different Park and proves
she belongs right up there with Miranda Lambert and Brad Paisley with
lyrics that are spot-on and pretty damn hilarious too. A real comer.
14. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA  - Hamilton Original Cast Album  It's a
phenomenon and you really haven't lived until you hear the voice of your
friend's two little kids (eight and younger) floating in from the kitchen andspontaneously breaking out with, "We're reliable with the la-dies !" Having
seen the show, the album feels more of a keepsake to me, a prod to the</p>
<p>memory of what I enjoyed in the theater. So I never expected how
completely it would cross over to people who never make it to Broadway
and rarely if ever listen to hip-hop. Multiple plays do let you savor the
brilliant lyrics, though the pleasure of that may be dimmed for studentssince hip history teachers will be playing excerpts in class for generationsto come.
15. ORANGE HUMBLE BAND  - Depressing Beauty  So good, you'd swear
it was a reissue. Slap on this album (if you can find it) and you'll hear an
early 1970s, Big Star vibe. Track down who it is (the album came to mevia a friend) and lo and behold it's a super group of artists beloved by
those in the know, including folks from the Posies and yes Big Star,
among others. I hope it's on streaming services because this power popgem has apparently barely surfaced in record stores. Now I need to dig
out their earlier releases, which apparently are just as good.
16. COWBOY JUNKIES  - Notes Falling Slowly  Few acts enjoy the
universal praise that greeted the debut album of Cowboy Junkies. It was
all deserved though they've labored in the shadow of the hushed majestyof The Trinity Sessions  ever since. I believe Michael Timmins is an
exceptional songwriter (especially good at writing for women) and their
music proved consistently solid to me longer than most paid attention.
But yeah, they drifted off my radar. So what's this boxed set? A mélangeof re-mastering and re-recording of several recent albums and essentiallya new album culled from the sessions that produced them? WTF? Well, I
haven't done a thorough comparison yet of those re-thought albums but
the de facto new release is terrific, offering the sonic kick that this act
could always deliver live. Pay attention. Again.
17. TINARIWEN  - Live In Paris, 2014  How embarrassing the lack of world
music. I've imagined for a few years that when economic times are tough,
our musical horizons shrink. We've less time to explore musical byways
around the world. Literally, I've found less world music to even sample inthe nutty, roundabout way I listen to music (press contacts, friends,purchases and no streaming because I'm a fuddy duddy). In desperation,
I turned to Tinariwen, a band from the Sahara, literally appearing out of
the desert, he said in a Western appeal to exoticism. I keep thinking thisTuareg group that combined electric guitar with traditional vocals andinstrumentation would prove a fad, the sort of world music group that has
a brief faddish heyday and then drops out of sight. But they keep
delivering strong albums and this live album is no exception. Keepproving me wrong.
18. CARRIE UNDERWOOD  - Storyteller  When you're looking for brassy
country music that offers the kick of pop but isn't desperate to cross</p>
<p>over, Underwood delivers. Her body of work is increasingly impressive.
19. TAME IMPALA  - Currents  That moment when your nephew hears you
natter on about Sufjan Stevens (hadn't heard of him) and The Tallest Man
On Earth (loves them, thanks to your recommendation) and then casuallyasserts, "But of course the best album of the year is by Tame Impala."
You nod noncommittally, rush out and start listening. Darned if he wasn't
on to something.
20. AMY LAVERE AND WILL SEXTON  - Hallelujah, I'm A Dreamer  Yes,
we remain in a golden age for duets albums and here's the latest
example. I was just catching up with LaVere and her excellent Runaway'sDiary  and here she is with a duets album featuring her husband, guitarist
Will Sexton, which blew me away. It confirms her huge talent and now I'mkicking myself for not seeing them on tour.
21. DRAKE  -- If You're Reading This, It's Too Late  He lost me there for a
moment; the bitching about fame became a little tiresome. (Not to
mention the constant references to bitches.) Somehow he's regained hissense of humor despite the burden of celebrity remaining topic numberone. And his vocals remain killer in their ability to put a spin on quotidian
lines like, "I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi!" The way
he groans "waa-faa" is priceless and his new album has countlesstouches like that. He isn't going anywhere.
22. SARA BAREILLES  - What's Inside: Songs From Waitress  Okay, I know
you've been listening to Hamilton  nonstop but the Broadway album that
has me captivated is this precursor to the new musical Waitress. Sure, I
was beaten into submission by the single "Brave" by Bareilles. But that
didn't prepare me for this labor of love, an album of songs she wrote forthe show based on the indie film about a woman who escapes an abusive
man thanks to her baking pies. (See it.) I had no expectations but the
opening track with it's haunting, lovely "Sugar...sugar, butter...sugar,butter, flour" chorus wowed me to no end. Track after track did whatsongs in a great musical should do: set the scene, reveal characters,
advance the plot and all in tunes you want to sing along with right away. I
am very excited to see the show when it opens and now very excited bywhat Bareilles will do next as a recording artist.
23. JASON ISBELL  -- Something More Than Free  Isbell follows up his
hugely acclaimed Southeastern  with this very worthy CD. The praise was
deserved and he's proven it can spur him on to more great work. A
companion piece, the next chapter, call it what you will. But anyone who
enjoyed Southeastern or meant to get around to listening to it has a newalbum to add to their to-do list.</p>
<p>24. VINCE STAPLES  - Summertime '06  Listening to music on your phone
is pretty weird when it gets right down to it. One result is that the names
of artists and albums make less of an impression than the days when you
held a CD or LP in your hand and saw the record label and a picture ofthe act and read liner notes and so on. Plus, there's just so damn muchof it. Which explains how I had a Vince Staples album on my phone but
somehow had it in my head that this new act was some sort of
Americana artist. Then I played it and my head did a 360 as this rap artistlet fly. Once I recovered my equilibrium, I realized he was a damn goodrap act, nipping at the heels of Drake. He never ran from anything, except
the police? Hilarious, pointed and smart.
25. VERUCA SALT  - Ghost Notes  Sometimes you just want to rock out
and this year it was Veruca Salt (and the Fratellis) that let me do so.
26. LOS LOBOS  - Gates Of Gold  A legacy act. Hall of Famers. Call them
what you will. Somehow I've never seen Los Lobos in concert but boy
does their new release make me want to do so. I've grown to appreciate
Kiko more and more over the years. This is less eccentric, more rootsy
and engaged in the real world with their feet on the ground. You'll find alot of veteran acts on my list this year. Some are consistent players in my
"best of the year" roundups. Others like Los Lobos are artists I always
lend an ear to and always respect but don't always make the cut. Thistime they do and it reminds me of how great they can be.
27. LINDI ORTEGA  - Faded Gloryville  Suddenly, the influence that
Underwood and Lambert have had on the country music scene becomes
apparent thanks to a flood of talented artists who have their own strongidentity, great songwriting chops and a determination to make it on their
own terms. Ortega is just the latest -- along with Musgraves -- to prove
this new crop is sticking around.
28. SHAKEY GRAVES  - Nobody's Fool  This one-time, one-man band
from Austin, Texas has worked with other artists, notably on his solid
2014 outing And The War Came. But he really captured me with theEP/album tossed out to the world back in February, a ten-track thing of
beauty that for whatever reason was available for three days and then
disappeared. It's the sort of nutty gesture independent artists can makethese days but when it happens with music that takes them to another
level of skill and beauty, you have to wonder - shouldn't something this
good be available forever? Find it if you can.
29. STEVE EARLE  - Terraplane  Oh, another really, really good album from
Steve Earle? What's there to say about that? It's not some crazy offshoot
into new musical territory. It doesn't have a hit single. (He almost never
did.) It's not tied into a movie or TV show. So it comes and goes and the</p>
<p>press says nothing but the people who listen know this is another work of
exceptional quality to add to the shelf. He's been so good for so long that
the only thing that surprises me is when this country/Americana/blues act
delivers an album that doesn't make it onto my best of the year list. Ithappens. Just not very often.
30. FALL OUT BOY  - American Beauty/American Psycho  - Did Queen ever
get any respect back in the day? I feel like Fall Out Boy and Panic At The
Disco! and My Chemical Romance were/are some of the best acts of thepast decade. Yet they seem thoroughly ignored by most, as if pop hooksand gleefully catchy choruses and thundering melodies sung by talented
young guys with an army of kids singing along and all of them ready to fill
a stadium are a bad thing.
31. GARNETT MIMMS  - Lookin' For You: The Complete Atlantic and Veep
Singles 1963-1967  (compilation of the year) If you were listing my favorite
albums of the year by sheer repetition, this compilation of soul gems by
Garnett Mimms would be at Number One. I literally couldn't stop playing
it for a while. Each song became more and more distinctive every time Iheard them. It's what great pop songs do. Mimms was never a huge act,almost disappearing just as he got started. (Then the Lord called him
away, like He did with Al Green. Why does God have to mess up music
careers like that?) Here's what we missed. Remember greatest hitsalbums? One like this can capture the brilliance of an act and make acase for them like nobody's business. Anyone with a passion for soul
music needs to go out and buy this one right away.
32. PATTY GRIFFIN  - Servant Of Love  I love a late bloomer. It gives me
hope that I might actually do something worthwhile some day. Griffin hit
her stride in her 40s with the gem Children Running Through  in 2007 and
she's been on a hot streak ever since. She's toured with Emmylou Harris,
been covered by the Dixie Chicks and won Grammys. And Servant Of
Love  continues her run with aplomb. Let's not start taking her for granted
just as she's getting going.
33. BONES  - Powder  To be honest, Bones had about 37 other albums,
EPs and singles released in 2015. This may even be the best
representation of what he's up to right now. But this act famed forreleasing his music for free and refusing major label entreaties remains a
darknet pleasure, a moody, spooky, beautifully mysterious artist whose
music keeps pouring out. I just know Drake has been listening because Ican hear it. His production remains the trump card but his rapping andlyrics aren't fall behind.
34. DWIGHT YOAKAM  - Second-Hand Heart  Well, hell. After years of
losing interest? Feeling uninspired? I don't know, but Yoakam wasn't</p>
<p>feeling it and neither was I. He snapped back into shape with 3 Pears  and
now this follow-up is even punchier, with the sonic snap that
distinguished his best work back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Late
1980s? Has it been that long?
35. DANIEL ROMANO  - If I've Only One Time Askin'  It's like Daniel
Romano can hear in his head the greatness of George Jones at his
absolute best. He crafts the songs and production to deliver and then
does his damndest to sing the hell out of them. The tension here isbetween the voice in his head and the voice he has. It's a good voice but
it's not George Jones and he refuses to acknowledge that, which makes it
somehow kind of vulnerable and beautiful in an entirely different way. Andhe's a hell of a songwriter, so there's that.
36. ADELE  - 25  Heck, it's not her fault the entire world is listening. I really
can't judge this album yet. The first two singles are great and she's got
the insanely catchy and fun "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)" waiting
in the wings. And great pop music always improves with the sort of
repetition that only radio play can offer. Oh it's a commercial behemothand deservedly so. But is it as good as 21 ? I don't think so. Is it a sign of
growth? Not quite. Yet with those pipes and the intense glare of the
media, maybe I'm reacting to the noise of what surrounds her rather than
the music itself. And hell, I was there for "Chasing Pavements" and neverexpected all of this so I'm not ready to stop listening yet.
37. THE MAVERICKS  - Mono  The reunion of this group has been a joy
and not just because it meant I got to see them live in concert again.
(They're one of the best live acts, ever.) I was so happy to hear 2013's In
Time  that I couldn't quite be sure how good it was. The first time around,
they'd gone wackier and wackier and frankly I loved the country-politan
sound of Music For All Occasions  and the bold eccentricity of Trampoline .
Their "final" album seemed a retreat and now their return seemed rootedperhaps in familiar territory. But each album has boasted a handful oftunes that just kill in performance and they are solid, as if the band knowswho they are now and has nothing to prove other than that they can still
deliver. Comfortable in their own skin.
38. ANDERSON EAST  - Delilah  Speaking of Boz Scaggs and Van
Morrison, here's a debut album from a kid who wants to keep the soul
flame burning. Anyone listening to Leon Bridges should put that down
and check this out. Occasionally stunning, always solid, this is a veryappealing opener. Can't wait to see him live.
39. DON HENLEY  - Cass County  Yet another veteran on my list. I don't
believe I've ever had the Eagles or Don Henley solo on my list for the best
of the year. Mind you, the Eagles' Greatest Hits  is an essential and I've</p>
<p>always loved Henley's voice. (Indeed, his solo greatest hits is also a
strong buy.) But for whatever reason, his albums have always kept me at
arm's length emotionally. Not here. This natural segue into pure countryworks like a charm for an artist who has always drawn on that musicalgenre for his best work. Make sure you avoid the deluxe edition. It's the
shorter, punchier version that makes the best case for this music. Mind
you, I think they messed up the track listing so ideally you'll figure that outand make a playlist to correct that error and get the flow right. But songfor song, this is his best work and I suppose I should thank Lite FM for
playing the heck out of "Take A Picture Of This" and getting me to dive
back into the album.
40. CAGE THE ELEPHANT  - Tell Me I'm Pretty  Okay, you're pretty. And
catchy and hook-filled and rocking and maybe it's just a youthful
infatuation (or in this case, an infatuation with youth) but I'm willing to
take a chance on you sticking around for a while.
41. ERIC CHURCH  - Mr. Misunderstood  A country outlaw of sorts, if
touting the pleasures of marijuana still counts as an outlaw gesture these
days. (I think promoting abstinence would be edgier, actually.) Yet
another batch of music dropped on the world unexpectedly. The real
surprise here was how fatherhood has humanized and slowed downChurch and deepened his songwriting. Good stuff.
42. BOB DYLAN  - Shadows In The Night  At the most, bad music usually
just elicits a shrug. Bold music, unexpected music, wild left turns? Well,
those elicit anger and confusion and sadness and derision. When Dylanreleased this album of standards, a tribute to Frank Sinatra recorded not
with strings or a jazz combo but his touring band, the general reaction
was WTF? (In contrast, his recent album of Christmas music got a shrug.)Dylan's been here before. Anger and confusion and villagers armed with
pitchforks and torches greeted Dylan when he went electric, when he
went country, when he found Jesus (and then lost Him again). Heck, themost lambasted album of his career - Self Portrait  - came from recording
sessions that have now produced music that has become widely
acknowledged as pretty fricking amazing. Those sessions, not to mention
his cover albums from the 1990s and his constant references lyrically andmusically to classic folk tunes and poems of the past as well as the wide
musical palette he's employed drawing in everything from Stephen Foster
to swamp music have made one thing abundantly clear: Bob Dylan drawsupon popular music. All of it. Of course the natural comparison is WillieNelson's Stardust , an album greeted I believe with confusion and a little
indifference until it steamrolled into a remarkable commercial hit andbecame recognized as a classic. Nelson has always wandered far andwide into different genres (reggae and blues and so on) while Dylan has</p>
<p>taken up various strands and woven them into his own unique and
distinctive style. So here he is, one of the most influential singers of all
time, tackling some standards. At first listen, I was intrigued if not floored.At second listen, I thought, let me take a break from this for a while. I'mjust not sure what I think. Obviously, this wasn't one of his tossed off
albums; he was singing with care and attention to the lyrics. But was it
good? Well, it's definitely good; but how good I can't quite say yet. Butover the course of months of returning to it when the mood struck,Shadows In The Night  has deepened for me, become stronger, sturdier,
more moving. Why this rush to judgement? Sometimes, it takes a while toappreciate an album's strengths (and its flaws, for that matter). Peoplemake up their minds about an artist and just close their ears. DavidBowie's death was mourned to a remarkable degree. But the truth is that
until 2013's The Next Day , the world had spent 30 years pretty much
dismissing everything he recorded from Tin Machine to solo work. The
albums were listened to once, if at all, and then tossed aside. (I include
myself here. A good friend pointed out for years that the people who
ignored Bowie's post Let's Dance  music hadn't really listened  to Bowie's
post Let's Dance  music, not really. Don't great artists deserve more
careful attention? A year from now, I'll bet Shadows In The Night climbs
up higher on this list. Five years from now? Ten? We'll see. He's recorded
his share of clunkers over the years. How could any real artist not do so?But it's never smart to bet against Dylan. Like Carrie & Lowell,  this has a
fragile beauty, with Dylan allowing his voice to waver and sigh, sounding
as vulnerable as ever, whether tackling "Some Enchanted Evening" or
pondering "What'll I Do?" It may be his most emotional, open-hearted
album. Why this? Why now? What can I say? All I know is that I keep
coming back to it, puzzling it over or just letting its quiet tenderness washover me. "Who can explain it? Who can tell you why?" he declaims at onepoint. "Fools give you reasons. Wise men never try."
FADE OUT
Looking back at my list, I'm surprised by how many veterans popped up
on it. I certainly didn't hear the year that way, at least not until I actually
looked at what I listened to and rated highly. It's a good year for some oldfriends! And yet, I've never listened to more new albums than ever before.Maybe that's why I assumed this list would be dominated by newer acts.
Instead, I discovered Los Lobos and the like made a good showing in
2015.
Why's this? I think it's the tidal wave of music available. It used to be only
critics who got swamped by a flood of CDs (or cassettes or LPs or
whatever). But even Robert Christgau never had quite as many actualalbums in his office as any casual fan can access on Pandora right now.</p>
<p>And when the options grow and grow, it's no shocker to realize you
gravitate to familiar territory, checking out the latest from familiar acts. I
miss the gatekeepers: it's fun to stumble upon an album that's barely
been released anywhere in the world like Humble Orange Band.
But finding that meant I also plowed through a LOT of albums that never
would have made it on my radar in the past since they would have had to
make it to a label and then the publicist would have to decide to forward
it to me. That system had its minuses, but stemming the rising waterswas one of the positives.
This seems to extend to genres as well: I've lost track of a lot of world
music and jazz and other, less-beaten paths I've known and loved in thepast. Plus, I'm getting older and find myself increasingly drawn to what
for lack of a better word I'll call Americana, all those strains of music that
draw upon folk and blues and the like.
Or maybe it's the hard times I see all around me, from the homeless
people I pass sleeping on the sidewalk every cold night or the smallbusiness owners who welcome me haunting their diners late at night justso they have someone to talk to and people walking by know they're still
open. In hard times, sometimes the truth rings louder strummed on a
guitar.
In 2016, I'll try to be more discerning AND more broad-minded in terms of
style. Now tell me what albums I foolishly left off! I can't wait to check
them out.
