Look At Me ***'/2 . Sony Pictures Classics, $29.95 
THIS word-of-mouth art-house 
hit is refreshingly adult and 
intelligent fare. Lolita (Marilou 
Berry) is the frumpy daughter 
of a famous and famously 
egotistical novelist (the 
wonderfully hateful Jean-Pierre 
Bacri) who yearns for her 
father's attention. If Woody 
Allen were French -and you 
know he wishes he were -this 
is the sort of fllm he'd make. 
Dallas: Third Season **'/2 . 
Warner Bros., $39.98 
WHO shot J.R.? That was the 
gripping question that 
enthralled America at me end 
of this potboiler anchored, as 
always, by Larry Hagman's 
scenery chewing. Of course, 
you have to wait for the fourth 
season to get the answer, but The Muppet 
Show: Season 
One· ***.Y2 Buena Vista, $39.99 
·IT'S the most sensa­
tional. inspirational, 
celebrational, well, 
certainly it's ,a very 
welcome DVD. "The 
Muppet Show" finally 
gets treated right after 
years of slap-dash 
compilations. Here 
you'll fmd·the charming 
first season loaded with 
extras like the original 
pilot -which was 
geared more to adults 
and eVen shows Kermit 
apparently offering a job 
through the casting 
couch. The rest is 
delightful family fare, 
of course. . 
you do get a new documentary 
-about the frenzy surroundin g 
this rather standard cliffhanger. 
Other TV mysteries out now: 
Peter Falk's "Columbo : Third 
Season" and Rock Hudson's 
"McMillan & Wife: Season 
One" (Universal, $39.98 each). 
Because of Winn-DiXie *** Fox, $29.98 
THE sweet young adult novel 
by Kate DiCamillo is given 
loving treatmentin this fine 
family film. Director Wayne 
Wang keeps the sentimen !ality 
(almost) at bay and solid aCtors 
like Jeff Daniels, Eva Marie 
Saint and CiCely Tyson 
surround newcomer 
Annasophia Robb while she 
anchors the story of a little girl 
and her dog in. a small Southern 
town. Extras include 
commentary by Daniels and a 
featutette on trai,ning dogs. .</p>
