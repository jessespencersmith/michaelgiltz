One hour felt like two hours in Chicago where talent
was thin on the ground. As a result, the judges were so
relieved to hear people that didn't suck, they let some
through that didn't deserve it. Humor and notablecharacters were also lacking, thank goodness. As Idol
continues, I find I have less and less patience for bad
auditions and NO patience for the show using cluelessfolks as fodder for fun. Luckily, the show seems to beavoiding cattiness this season as well. But there's not
much you can do when the singing is bad. Here's a
rundown of the people who auditioned that got
through.
KATELYN EPPERLY  -- Her parents are splitting up so to placate her mom, Katelyn is finally
auditioning. Sang "Syrup and Honey" by Duffy. Wore boots. Looked good and had presence, though not a
big voice. Interesting.
CHARITY VANCE  -- Sang "Summertime." Cute 16 year old girl whose parents are hairdressers. With
eight gazillion songs to choose from, why do so many people choose songs the judges 9and we) have
heard a thousand times? She had way too many trills and runs in her vocal, a sure sign of inexperience.Maybe she'll surprise, but seems too young to me. And it's clear where the power still lies: she came outof the room and told her family, "Simon said yes!"
ANGELA MARTIN  -- Sang "Just Fine" by Mary J. Blige. (Thank God she didn't audition in Atlanta in
front of Blige or that might have thrown her off.) Martin has had enough drama to fuel three soap operas.
She auditioned in season seven so she could help take care of her ailing baby girl. Luckily, Shriner's
Hospital saw her and pledged free medical care until her daughter is 21. Then her father was killed rightbefore she left for Hollywood and Martin was emotionally shattered She auditioned in Season Eight but
had to bow out of Hollywood because she had a traffic violation and had to go to court and apparently
couldn't get them to change the court date. (Maybe it was Judge Judy.) Now she's back and in control,sounding good, looking good and singing with maturity. Excellent audition and clearly the best of the

Weight...day. She's not messing around. Kara threw in a "Pay your tickets, girl." Ugh.
Oodles of bad auditions followed including a mock silent movie segment that managed to make light of
the failure without picking on any contestants. Smart moment.
JOHN PARK  -- Sang...see, I forgot to write down what he sang because it was boring and I didn't think
he'd get through. OK male choir coice and he's definitely good-looking. But I think the judges were so
beaten down by a day of bad auditions that they overreacted to his not sucking. Clean, straightforward,but not lots of character. Maybe he'll show a lot more in Hollywood, but kind of dull to me.
PAIGE DECHAUSSE -- Sang Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come." This is asthma girl, a young
woman who has been singing all her life but lives with asthma and had such a severe attack once she
almost died. She seemed to lose her key when singing the song, threw in WAY too many riffs and trills
and worst of all screwed up the lyrics, singing two lines from the first verse and one line from the secondand changing a few words IN the lines, none of which was mentioned by the judges. Simon rightly said itwas self-indulgent but Shania Twain and Kara liked her and cajoled Randy into giving her another shot.
Maybe Simon's "no" will be a wake-up call?
So a very weak day with just one audition I wholly supported. By the way, if you find it hard to sit
through a one hour show without a lot of talent, think of the hundreds if not thousands of auditions the
judges endure.
At the end, they wisely showed 10-20 seconds or so of the rest of the winning auditions. Why they don't
do this EVERY night of audition week is beyond me. And online they're finally showing memorableauditions and interviews with all (?) he golden ticket winners but still not every winning audition, which
again puzzles me no end. Why not let us see EVERY winning audition in full? It can only increase our
interest in Hollywood and expands the franchise beyond TV and to the website. You'd think it would be ano-brainer.
So who did you like and did you agree with the judges?

that AI doesn't have rights to.
AI has a biased demographi c and contestant s who make it are often limited to four groups. They
hardly ever seem to pick ethnics with voweled surnames. And when they do, they don't often make
it very far.
Not sure what your comment is about. Maybe you could be less vague and more specific?Certainly Idol has been pretty racially diverse, more so than most TV shows. But that's beenpar for the course in reality TV, which often reflects the diversity of America much betterthan sitcoms and dramas. Though apparently not as much as you'd like, I take it.
Good to see you back for another round, Michael!
Thanks for noticing!
All I have to say is Idol in general is a waste. And I would like to know where pieces of the"chicago" auditions were filmed because chicago does not have palm trees. In the summer inplanters at one beach? Yes. Outside on the streets and around venues?? No. Its the midwest, no
palm trees people.
I've seen palm trees by the lake, haven't I? They film people at their homes after the
auditions when they want to tell a story and not everyone is FROM Chicago that auditionsthere, so perhaps that's the reason you saw a location that didn't look like Chicago. Peoplefly from all over to audition, you know. The show's way too successful , I fear, to have to
fake where they're shooting.
Right, palm trees at one beach... But I will rewatch to see what parts all the palmtrees were at. I don't believe (could be wrong) that the scences with palms wereTOP VIDEO PICKS

59 Fanswhen AI was following specifc people... it was group shots. But I will check. :) Even
though I am questionin g shots in the chicago area, there is no mistaking the
ghettofied chicago style cursing. (not proud of it) but it happens everywhere .
i was bored to tears by chicago's auditions.
and i completely agree with you about showing us more of the people who pass onto hollyowod. i
always skip the part of the season between auditions and the top ten, because i'm sick of the showby the end of the auditions. ... and have no vested interest in any of the contestant s who actually
pass on.
Exactly. Hollywood would be a lot more interestin g if we could actually watch the auditions
of everyone who made it online. Since they're not showing them on-air, I literally have no
idea why Idol doesn't drive traffic to their website by showing the complete auditions there.
Like you, a lot of people tune out Hollywood and come back for the top ten. But this year Iimagine Ellen's presence will bring in some new viewers wanting to see how she does.Thanks for reading.MORE BIG NEWS PAGES  »
