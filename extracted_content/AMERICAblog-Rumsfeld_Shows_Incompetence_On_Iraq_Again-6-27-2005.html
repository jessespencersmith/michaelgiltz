6/27/2005 07:14:00 PMUPDATE: Crooks and Liars has the video of Rumsfeld admittingthat we're meeting with the insurgency. That was before hedenied it today.Anyone in the media or the Republican Party still wonderingwhy Americans have lost total confidence in Bush's ability tolead our country in a time of war? The incompetence of his topadvisers is one place where to start.Rumsfeld went on the Sunday talk shows where he repeatedlyand explicity confirmed over several shows and several hours aBritish newspaper report that the US military had been meetingwith insurgents. In fact, he went FARTHER than the report andblithely claimed that these meetings had been going on all thetime.He blithely insisted that "none" of the insurgents we werenegotiating with were terrorists, when Tim Russert pressed himabout this on "Meet The Press." I was just about to post on thisissue, wondering exactly which part of the insurgency WASN'Tinvolved in terrorism or direct attacks on US troops, since thatis their entire strategy. Did they say they weren't when heasked? And if they did, how could Rummy possibly check itout? And if it didn't check out, by what possible standardscould they be considered insurgents? In short, Rummyconfirmed repeatedly on Sunday that we were negotiating withterrorists or he simply was completely incompetent and had noidea what he was talking about.Today, Rummy has seized on the "I'm a complete idiot"argument. Reuters and AFP are reporting that top militaryleaders in Iraq have insisted absolutely NO talks have beenstarted or contemplated between the US military and theinsurgents.Rumsfeld chastised the news media for the attention given tothe subject."I must say, I've been impressed how overblown thesemeetings are, these, quote-unquote, meetings. I don't knowanything about specific meetings on specific days, nor doesGeneral Casey," Rumsfeld said."But there are meetings going on all the time between peoplein Iraq and other people in Iraq, attempting to get them to besupportive of the government, which is, obviously, the logicalthing one does in a political process," Rumsfeld said.So Rummy has completely contradicted himself and proven hedoesn't have a clue as to what is going on in Iraq. No biggie fora Sec. of Defense who in those same interviews agreed theinsurgency was in its last throes AND that it could continue forthe next decade, if not longer.When Bush, Cheney and Rummy repeatedly stare facts in theface and refuse to admit to them, they unnerve the Americanpeople and lose our confidence in their ability to even recognizea problem, much less respond to it and solve it. That is why theAmerican people have lost faith in George Bush.
