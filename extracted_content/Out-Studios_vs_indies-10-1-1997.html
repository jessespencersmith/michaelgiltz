            <p>Clash of the Titans 
Pairing up the hottest studio and indie flicks. 
FILMMAK ING HAS ITS OWN CLASS SYSTEM: Studio-creat­
ed blockbusters with huge stars (or at least huge budgets) on the 
one hand, and more economical (and often more human-scaled) 
independently financed movies on the other. Since the themes 
are often the same, our selective look at this fall's releases pairs up one 
film from each side of the tracks, to illuminate the differences-and 
the similarities. You can decide which flicks show true class, and which 
are simply crass.-MICH AEL GILTZ 
Studio film 
TItanicWaramount) . 
Passengers Leonardo DiCaprio 
and Kate Winslet strike sparks 
as their ship strikes an iceberg. 
Old Friends (TriStar). 
Curmudgeon Jack Nicholson 
falls for single mom Helen 
Hunt while caring for a dog 
belonging to his gay neighbor 
(Greg Kinnear). Independent film 
The Swaetlleraaftw' 
(Fine Line Features). A school 
bus accident devastates a 
small town. Starring the great 
Ian Holm. 
OneMghtStaad (New 
Line). After Leaving Las Vegas, 
Mike Figgis has Wesley Snipes 
fooling around with Nastassja 
Kinski. Gay buddy Robert 
Downey Jr. gets sick with 
AIDS. How original. Our take 
Only God could sink this 
Titanic, but Hereafters 
Canadian director, Atom 
Egoyan (Exotica). keeps 
getting better, and the bus 
crash is haunting. 
Casting bland Kinnear as a 
gay man is some kind of 
progress: We're'officially 
boring. Still, every lesbian will 
hope that if grizzled Jack can 
get ahead with Helen, they 
could really score. 
OUT OCTOBER 1997 67</p>
<p>Seven Years in Tibet 
(TriStar/Mandalay). Brad 
Pitt says, "Hello, Dalai" as 
tutorto the boy Lama while 
World War II brews. He 
learns a few things himself. 
Gattaca (Columbia) . Ethan 
Hawke is born imperfect 
(huh?) in a genetically 
programmed-and lavishly 
realized-future society. 
Sadly, he chases after Uma 
Thurman rather than co­
star Jude Law. 
Alien Resurection (20th 
Century Fox). Ripley's clone 
(Sigourney Weaver) teams 
with neophyte action hero 
Winona Ryderto do battle 
againstthe beast ies. 
Anastasia (Fox Family 
Films). Veteren animator-at-
large Don Bluth retells the 
fable of the lost Russian 
princess, with Disney-
esque songs and the voices 
of Meg Ryan, John Cusack, 
and Bernadette Peters. 
Midnight in the Garden 
of Good and Evil (Warner 
Bros.). John Berendt's 
indefagitable bestseller, 
with John Cusack as the 
writer and Kevin Spacey as 
the gay antique dealer and 
suspected murderer. 
Sphere (Warner Bros.). 
Dustin Hoffman and Samuel 
L. Jackson examine an 
alien object found atthe 
bottom ofthe ocean. Stone 
plays a biochemist. Independent film 
Bent (MGM). Martin 
Sherman's classic play 
about gay men imprisoned 
in Nazi Germany finally 
becomes a movie, with 
cameos from Sir Ian 
McKelien and Mick Jagger. 
Good Will Hunting 
(Mira max). Working-class 
genius Matt Damon doesn't 
fit in with his old buddy 
(Ben Affleck) or his 
college-educated sweetie 
(Minnie Driver). Gus Van 
Sant directs. 
Scream2 (Miramax). The 
kids who didn't get offed 
last time-Neve Campbell, 
David Arquette, Courtney 
Cox-hope their luck holds 
out, this time on a college 
campus. 
Slaves to the 
Underground (First Look). 
The Seattle indie music 
scene finds newcomers 
Molly Gross, Marisa Ryan, 
and Jason Bortz in our kind 
of romantic triangle. 
Jackie Brown (Miramax) . 
Elmore Leonard's Rum 
Punch gets Quentin 
Tarantino-ed, with 
blaxploitation queen Pam 
Grier as an airline 
stewardess caught 
between cops and dealers. 
The Mighty (Miramax) . 
Two boys, a slow-witted 
giant and a tiny Einstein in 
leg braces (Kieran Culkin), 
find strength in numbers. 
Stone plays Culkin's mom. 
68 OCTOBER 1997 OUT Our take 
Tibetdirector Jean-Jacques 
Annaud bets that Pitt's star 
power will beat out Martin 
Scorsese's rival Dalai pic 
Kundun. But can Brad look 
spiritually awakened? 
We're willing to find out. 
After his To Die Forcritical 
triumph, Van Sant is in 
command-but may be 
deprived of his usual tools 
of edgy irony and offbeat 
riffs. Gattaca, meanwhile, is 
both gorgeous and smart. 
See it. 
Will metadiscussions of 
movie sequels be enough to 
make a second Scream as 
smart as the first? And 
would they have bothered 
doing Alien 4 unless it's 
going to kick ass? 
Anastasia may be more 
adult and romantic than any 
cartoon since Beauty and 
the Beast-it's even got 
Angela Lansbury. But 
Slaves wins the blue ribbon 
for hipness with its 
ultra cool soundtrack . 
Midnightcan't miss, with 
Clint Eastwood atthe helm 
and The Lady Chablis living 
the fantasy, playing herself. 
Note to Quentin: Fewer 
interviews and 
moonlighting as an actor, 
more movies. 
With Gillian Anderson in a 
small role, start with The 
Mighty. Sphere director 
Barry Levinson (Diner, Rain 
Man) should stay out of 
Spielberg territory.</p>
