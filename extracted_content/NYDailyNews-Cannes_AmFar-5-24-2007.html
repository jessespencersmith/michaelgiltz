Palfrey is aching lo out more of her
alleged johns.
"lt's almost like lve have a oublic
' obligation to s,"e that
thcse records are thoroughly
investigated by responsible
peo0le," Palfroy (r ) said
yesterday in a hushed voice in
the bar of thc Capital Hilton,
the same hotei where some
of hcr girls used to ply thelr
traoe.
Palfrey has been staying
at the hotel ever since U.S,
District .Judge Gladys Kessler
ruled that she was indigent
and that taxpayers must
provide for her lodging during
hcr fcderal racketeering case
(We also paid for her airfare; aptly, she flew
Unilcd )
Palfrey still believes ABC News reneged on
its hallyhooed promise to expose her former
customers in a TV special.
l-low many should have come out in the
ABC piece?
"Another five to 10, at least," the raven-
hdircd accused ser merchant wil h perfect
bangs told Thc News'James Gordon Meek-
"They were ready to go "
The ABC News probe did lead to the
resignatlon of a former customec ex-dcptrty
secretary of state Randall L. Tobi6 But the
network said thal, after researching records
of some 10,000 calls made at her agency,
reporters found no other even medium fish
to lry.
Kessler so far has blocked Palfrey Jrom
d0ling out any m0re phone records to
reporters Palfrey has turned over 13 years
ot cllent phone records to her new defense
lawyer, former Monica Lewinsky attorney
Burton Breston. rn hopc oi'finding pcople to
testify for her
"l am by n0 means interested in tlrewholesale slaughter of 10,000 names here,"
she said
''How nany people do I really expect to
come out of this? Twenty-fivc to 100."
Paltrey believes it's no
accident that, after escaping
prosecution for many years,
the feds are coming after her
Her conspiracy theories
weave together "9/11 Arab
connections," Baltimore
police scandals and the
unsolved murder of federal
prosecutor .Jonathan Luna.
"The cesspool of muck,"
she says, also involves the
politicization of the Bush
iustice Department. Tapping
on a newspaper photo of
former Justice official Monica
coodling, Palfrey said, "lt's the genesis
of my situation."
still, Palfrey, who hopes to move to
Germany when all this is over, admitted,
"l can't prove it."
!ii\\N Rose Mccowan isn't showing i
irS-t\ much guilt about removing
director Robert Rodriguez from his
wife, Elizabelh Avellan. l\,lcGowan and
Rodriguez (r.) nuzzled for the cameras
at Wednesday's AmFAR benefit in
Cannes But Mccowan doesn't seem as
inured to Dita Von Teese, the woman
Marilyn Manson married instead of her
- L4ccowan steppcd outside during
Von Teese's burlesque act. Meanwhile,
artist-dif ector Julian Schnabel seemed
both0red when bidding slowed on his
artworks ai the auction "lt's not a
party favor," Schnabel grumbled "l
don t knuw if anybody understands
or cares about art in this room " Most
everyone was bothcred by the heat$</p>
