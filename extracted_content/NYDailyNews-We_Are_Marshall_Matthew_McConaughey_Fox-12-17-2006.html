play coaches 
struggling to 
rebuild a college, 
snda town, from 
despalrafter -, 
tragedy In uWe 
Are,Marshall." 
In 1970, West Virginia's Marshall University suffered the 
worst air disaster in college sports history when a plane 
went down and killed 75 people, including virtually the 
entire football team, the coaches and many boosters and 
school officials from the town of Huntington, WVa. 
In 1971, against all odds -and even 
against the misgivings of some towns­
people still grieving -Marshall began 
the daunting task of playing football 
again, Just taking the field seemed like 
a victory, and that story is told in "We 
Are i'Y'arshall," a drama opening Fri­
day that stars Matthew McConaughey 
as Jack Lengyel, the new coach who ar­
rives in a shattered town, and Matthew 
Fox as Red Dawson, a surviving coach 
racked with guilt for having given up his seat on the plane before takeoff, 
McConaughey, 37, has been a star 
since his first major film, 1996's John 
Grisham thriller "A Time to Kill," land­
ed him on the cover of Vanity Fair af­
ter the Texas native spent years doing 
small roles in "Dazed and Confused" 
(1993), "The Texas Chainsaw Mas­
sacre: The Return" (1994) and "Lone 
Star" (1996)_ Pennsylvania-born Fox, 
40, jumped to fame in 1994 as the oldest 
sibling among a family of orphans on TV's "Party of Five," and in 2004, four 
years after "Party" was over, he resur­
faced on the hit ABC show "Lost" 
The two Matthews recently sat 
down to jaw with the Daily News about 
sports, whether telling a true-life tale 
was a burden or a privilege, and to 
share their favorite athletic moments . 
[To Fox] You've joked that you know 
you're growing up when they ask you to 
play one of the coaches instead of one of 
the players, 
FOX: Yeah, it makes you feel a little 
old. But I was glad to get back on the 
field. It was also kind of a relief. We'd 
been shooting the film for a while be­
fore we shot the football scenes. We'd 
done a lot of the real story. So it was fun 
to throw the ball around and have all 
the kids out there_ [To McConaughey] And Matthew, you'd 
been looking to play some sort of leader or 
teacher for a while, right? 
McCONAUGHEY: I dIdn't know it was 
going to come in the form of an actual 
coach, But coUege sports on down, I re­
alized you are more of a teacher than 
a coach: You have to be more of the la­
ther figure, the big brother. If a kid goes 
in there who has a great ability and runs 
a sloppy route, he needs his face mask 
grabbed and have his ass chewed out 
A kid goes in there who doesn't have 
great ability, who runs as hard as he can 
and misses the baU, but he's stiU tryin' 
-he's the one who needs an arm put 
around him,

experience breaking the streak at Colum­
bia University, where you had been a wide</p>

receiver In football? 
McCONAUGHEY: What'd you do? What 
streak did you break? 
FOX: I was part of a Columbia team that 
was setting the longest losing streak in 
NCAA history. When I was recruited , it was 
already 20 games deep. We finally -my se· 
nior year -ended the losing streak, by win· 
mng our homecoming game against Prince· 
ton. It was 44 games. 
McCONAUGHEY: 44! So you were 0 and 24 
leading in? Well, well! 
FOX: It was rough. But that's the great 
thing about football and any kind of team 
sports: You learn so much from that that 
you apply in your life. Certainly, I learned 
a lot about perseverance and believing in 
yourself and working hard and playing un· 
der intense adversity. But when we won that 
game, the fans came out of the woodwork . 
That was a three·day party. 
[To McConaughey] And you're a golf fanat· 
ic. What's your greatest athletic moment? A 
hole In one? 
McCONAUGHEY: I've had four hole in i FOUND ON TV 
: Fox was the 
, eldest sIbling On 
"Party of Five"

leads a group of 
plane crash SUr. 
vlvors (Including 
, Evangeline Ully) 
: on ulost.ft , 
ones! My first two were II days apart. 
Eleven days apart, man! And one I made 
in this tournament where whoever made 
the hole in one wins a brand· new Subur· 
ban. And no one had ever made a hole in 
one at the tournament -but I did. And 
then I found out: There never reo felt compelled to do it. 
McCONAUGHEY: Me, too, [Leans over 
conspiratorially] But I didn't tell my 
agents! [Laughs] I wanted to make sure 
they negotiated all right, but as soon as 
ally was a Subllrban! [Laughs 1 
People wanted to take 'em to 
court. We were like, "You 
know what man? Y'all han· 
dIe it and get the money to 
the Elks Lodge or whatever. " 
So it was like a big insurance 
scam and there never really 
was a truck. they closed I was like, "I"m in." It's sort of 
a privilege and an honor to be part 
of something that is bigger than 
myself. Fox says 
that he 'felt 
compelled' to 
do the film. One thing that was cool for 
me -[turns to Fox] I don't 
know about you -but we 
were portraying real pea· 
pIe. and dealing with a trag· 
edy that they had in their life. 
We could have had that weight 
-W·E·I·G·H·T -of responsibili· 
ty. But I never felt that; it was almost [To Fox] You've certainly waited a 
While to make the leap to movies. Obvious­
ly, with TV success on "Party of Five" In the 
'90s and now "Lost," you've had all sorts of 
opportunIties. What made you finally say yes 
to this one? 
FOX: Sometimes I'll read scripts that are 
really well executed but I just don't feel it 
And then with ·We Are Marshall," I just like it was lighter. After we talked to the 
townspeople. our minds and hearts were 
true and they were embracing that and it 
was a privilege more than it was a weight. 
FOX: I totally agree. It was the most 
amazing experience . And my first one out 
of the gate! It's all going to be downhill 
from here .• (
