ARCADIA  *** 1/2 out of ****
ETHEL BARRYMORE THEATRE
What a marvelous play! That's my first reaction after
seeing the new revival of Tom Stoppard 's Arcadia  on
Broadway.  I loved the original production in 1995 and
was eager to see it again. Why did we have to wait 16years? And where are the regular revivals of TheInvention Of Love?  I can understand the hesitation in
tackling the epic Coast Of Utopia . But it shouldn't be
just The Real Thing  that gets revived again and again, as
the sparkling Jumpers  proved a few years ago.
Time and reputation can play tricks on you. So many
people tell you how heady and intellectual Stoppard is that you forget how delightful and entertaining hisshows are. Like all great artists, whatever theories or ideas are embedded in the work, it all comes easilyto life because at heart Stoppard cares about characters, not concepts.
Here we have some of his best. The entire show is set in a stately home. In 1809, we enjoy the
shenanigans of Septimus (an excellent Tom Riley). He's the tutor of the astonishingly brilliant Thomasina(the also..oh, they're almost all very good, in this case, it's Bel Powley). But Septimus is also wooing LadyCroom (Margaret Colin) while diddling with the unseen wife of the hapless poet Ezra Chater (DavidTurner).
In the present, the home is peopled with the scholar Hannah (Lia Williams), who is researching a book
on the history of the home's garden, a notable item in the history of such things. The rather flashy andover-eager to publish scholar Bernard (Billy Crudup) also rushes in, hungry for fame and ready to jump

<p>on any evidence that Lord Byron stayed at the home and killed poor Ezra. Bernard dallies with the silly
daughter of the home's owners (Grace Gummer, the only one who captures the self-satisfied, slightlychildish air of the nobility) while Hannah is desired by Chloe's brother Valentine (Raul Esparza, movingas always), who is working on his own academic work using the information in the estate's centuries ofrecords on hunting.
Here's Esparza talking about the show in an interview with Show People .
There you have it. Romantic entanglements pinging off the romance of ideas and insights. Young
Thomasina is a frightfully clever child, though clever doesn't really capture it. She's a genius really, justcoming into her own, though in the present we learn that she died in a tragic fire right around her 17thbirthday. The great pleasure of the play is watching Septimus juggle the adult women in his life whileslowly falling in love with the mind and heart of Thomasina as she comes of age. Thomasina, we can see,has loved him from the start, though she will go on and on about Lord Byron.
Equally delightful is the exchange of ideas. Lady Croom is distraught over the radical changes being done
to her grounds by the designer Noakes (Byron Jennings), all in the name of the latest craze in landscape,
the "picturesque." In the present, one of the comedic high points occurs when Bernard reads aloud hispaper touting his "discovery" of new info on Byron, with Hannah and Valentine dropping in caustic jibesat every turn. Academic standards, the political and social symbolism of a hedge, Fermat's Last Theorem-- it's all in there. Never fear. The original Playbill had three essays (about gardens, Byron and Fermat)that helped ease any nerves. They're useful to read if you're seeing the show ( you can get a PDF here ),
but not necessary. You'll follow perfectly well what's going on; the essays just let you get your footingright away.
Crudup is especially fine. I think Victor Garber captured the more scheming, manipulative side of
academia (at least in my shaky memory of his marvelous work in 1995). But Crudup emphasizes thecharm of Bernard. He may be sloppy on dotting his "i's" and crossing his "t's" but he just wants to get onthe telly. Whatever magic Crudup has that isn't always captured on film clearly comes to life on the stage;our gain. Williams as his foil Hannah is his equal and a real find to those of us in America not familiarwith her work. So is Riley and Powley and all the other members of the original UK revival that made thejourney to New York.
Caveats? The British accents of the American cast are shaky at best. Gummer has the least interesting
role and does little with it, despite her success in capturing the spoiled but not rude nature of the
pampered. The mute Gus (Noah Robbins, quite good in his modern role) is saddled with a rather jarring,
noisy shirt in his first scene that distracts. The music cue towards the very end (our characters in the pastare somehow hearing modern music from the present while waiting for a waltz) is somehow not quiteright. And that's it.
The set and lighting are subtle and true, the direction by David Leveaux spot-on. And above all you

<p>remember the play, the talent of Stoppard . You remember the way characters from different eras are
suddenly on stage at the same time, bouncing off and circling around each other like subatomic particles.
And that waltz at the end, where it somehow, magically comes together -- the art, the math, the love, theinnocence, the past and the present. Let's hope we don't have to wait 16 years to see Arcadia  again.
