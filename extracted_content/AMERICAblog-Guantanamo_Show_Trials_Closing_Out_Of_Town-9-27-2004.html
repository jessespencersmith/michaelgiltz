9/27/2004 02:56:00 AMThe NYT details the many, many ways in which the Guantanamo showtrials are falling apart. The process "is in turmoil" according to manyinvolved, thanks to military panels filled with members who havepersonal conflicts or are unsuitable, inadequate translators (a bit of aproblem when dealing with foreign folk),a presiding officer who liedabout past statements and was caught red-handed (and red-faced)and lawyers on BOTH sides who agree it's become a farce. Growingmomentum calls for ditching the antiquated, unwieldly andquestionable military tribunals in exchange for court-martialproceedings.But two tidbits stood out. Did you know that the court-martial wasadopted in 1950 "as a direct response to the unfair features in themilitary tribunal system?" So we ditched tribunals more than 50 yearsago because they were unfair and inadequate and that's the systemBush wants to revive today? Why not just model ourselves on theSalem witch trials instead?And here's that lie that the panel's presiding officer Col. PeterBrownback III was caught in."Under questioning in a hearing, Colonel Brownback stated flatly thathe had never told a group of lawyers that the detainees had anyspeedy trial rights, a statement that could have demonstrated he didnot have an open mind on the issue. When he was then told by aNavy lawyer that an audio recording of such a meeting existed, hewas stunned and said he had not been aware the meeting was beingtaped."Brownback should be dismissed from this post and given a seriousreprimand, at the very least.
