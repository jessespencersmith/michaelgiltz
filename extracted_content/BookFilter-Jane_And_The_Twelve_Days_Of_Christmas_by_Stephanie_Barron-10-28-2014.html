Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayIdeally, one would begin a crime series at the beginning. But such is not always possible, I fear. So here I amweighing in on "Jane Austen and the Twelve Days Of Christmas" which is the twelfth mystery (neatly enough) aboutthe brilliant novelist's hitherto unknown second career as a puzzler of mysteries whose insight into human naturemakes her an ideal detective. Author Stephanie Barron aka Francine Mathews does a credible job of capturingAusten's voice and the period, though Austen scholars and historians surely will be better judges than me. As a fanof her books -- some of the greatest novels of all time -- I was amused and intrigued at the idea of spending time withher. Toss in a murder and a stately manor and I'm sold. This time, Austen is visiting with friends when a courierbearing important documents is murdered on his way to London. Is it a French spy? Thwarted romance? Or somecombination of the two? The mystery itself isn't wildly compelling -- I was more focused on Jane's intellectual flirtationwith a dashing house guest who might just be a spy himself. And the finale with its reveal was not top-notch, thoughserviceable. Others will have to say if the series is progressing nicely or repeating itself. As a newcomer, I wasdiverted and enjoyed myself enough to consider heading back to 1996's "Jane and the Unpleasantness At ScargraveManor" and start from the beginning. But since the Austen in this mystery is working on "Emma" when not examiningclues, I might have to reread that first. Surely Barron would approve. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for Jane and the Twelve Days of ChristmasLibraryReads November 2014 Top Ten List“Sings with not just a good plot but courtly language and an engaging group of characters worthy of the famednovelist herself . . . a first-rate mystery with so many twists and turns that you can hardly blame a reader who doesn'tfigure it out until the end.”—The Denver Post "[A]n excellent period mystery for all historical fiction fans . . .
