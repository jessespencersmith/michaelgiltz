OSCAR WATCH 
GLENN CLOSE MAY WANT TO 
avoid Woody Allen's latest. 
movie: Dianne Wiest is so 
funny as a grandly dramatic 
stage actress that seeing her 
perfOlmance might make 
it impossible to tackle 
NOlma Desmond with a 
straight face. The 
twenties comedy Bullets 
Over Broadway teems with 
other familiar names: 
Rob Reiner, Chazz 
Palminteri , Jennifer Tilly, 
and John Cusack as an 
aspiring playwright. "Woody 
Allen gives you complete and 
utter freedom," says Cusack. 
"He doesn't really care what 
you say, as long as it's in 
character. When you come 
in, he's got the shot mapped 
out, but it's sort of like a ski 
run. If you want to take some 
other moguls, you can do it." 
Featured at the New York 
Film Festival. (October 14.) 
Few movies are more anticipated than 
Interview With the 
Vampire, with Tom 
Cruise as the 
charmingly evil 
vampire Lestat. 
Director Neil Jordan 
was ready for a Gothic 
thriller: "When this 
book came up, 1 
thought, This is 
perfect," he says. "I 
wanted, I needed, to 
go in the direction of 
the grotesque." 
(November 18.) 
Following in the 
footsteps of Katharine 
Hepbum, Winona 
Ryder plays the 
spunky Jo in Little 
Women, director 
Gillian Armstrong 's 
third attempt to go 
Hollywood. Armstrong 
finally may have the 
right project and the 
right cast: Susan 
Sarandon , Trini 
Alvarado, Samantha 
Mathis, Gabriel Byme, and 
Eric Stoltz. (December 25.) 
Hepbum also makes her 
presence felt in Love Affair, 
the Warren Beatty-Annette 
Bening romance. Though 
Hepbum acts in TV movies 
every so often, she was 
initially quite reluctant to 
tackle another feature-film 
role. "I really had to pull 
her," Beatty says. "It was one 
of the most enjoyable 
experiences that 1 ever had in 
the movies-getting her to do 
it and working with her." 
(October 14.) 
Beatty hardly knows how 
to make a movie without 
being nominated for awards, 
and Jodie Foster is the same 
way. Nell has Oscar writ large 
all over it, from its origins on 
the stage (Mark Handley's 
Idioglossia) to its top-drawer 
adaptation (William 
Nicholson wrote the 
screenplay; Michael Apted . 
directed). Foster has the title 
role of a backwood s woman 
completely shut off from the

<p>world until her mother dies. 
(December.) 
Robert Altman is on top of 
the world. Short Cuts made 
only a fraction of the money 
that The Player took in, but 
he's still treated like a 
prophet returned from the was actually more upfront 
about everything. Everybody 
basically knew what was 
going on. His dentist knew. 
His maid knew. His barber 
knew. He didn't know how 
to deceive that much."

(Decem ber 21.) 
Every movie Robert 
Redford has directed received 
at least one Oscar 
nomination. So there's no . 
reason to expect less from his 
fourth, Quiz Show, a 
thoughtful look at the 1959 
TV scandal that took away 
what little was left of 
America's innocence. It 
features Ralph Fiennes, Rob 
Morrow, and John Turturro , 
who gives a memorable 
performance as Herbert 
Stempel, the contestant who 
helped blow the whistle. 
"Herb didn't really feel like 
he was cheating," explains 
Turturro. "[In real life], Herb is a conniving executive and 
Michael Douglas the poor 
schlep who fends off her 
advances , only to watch 
Moore brazenly accuse him 
of harassing her. But don't 
ask Dennis Miller-a weasely 
office buddy of Douglas's­
how he approached his role. 
"I don't know anything, quite 
frankly, about acting," he 
admits. Well, what's the 
movie like? Steamy? 
Tension-filled? "I kind of 
tried to stay away from 
reading the whole script," he 
says. "I didn't want to muddy 
my head. So 1 know as much 
about it as you do." 
(December 16.) 
Wesley Snipes plunges into 
the world of skydiving in the 
Not'a Ephroll's 'Lifesavers,' -with Steve Martill. thriller Drop Zone. This 
is the first chance for 
Snipes to carry a big­
budget action flick

end-of-the-year fray. 
The comedy stars 
Carrey and Jeff Daniels ...... fiII

As Albert Einstein, 
Walter Matthau has 
a very high I.Q., even 
when it comes to 
matters of love. His 
niece (Meg Ryan) 
plans to marry an 
egghead, but 
Einstein and his 
fellow scientists have 
their eye on a sweet 
mechanic (Tim 
Robbins). "They try to 
fob him off as a 
genius," says director 
Fred Schepisi. 'The 
scientists have him 
around a bit to discuss 
this thing he's supposed 
to have discovered: 
cold fusion." ot that 
again, surely. "Actually, 
someone at Princeton 
came up with 
something while we 
were there 
filming," he 
laughs. ''I'm 
hoping he 
continues. It will 
make the movie very 
spot-on." (December

The romantic 
comedy Junior 
reunites director Ivan 
Reitman with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger and 
Danny DeVito, and 
gives him a chance to 
work with Emma 
Thompson . Here, 
Thompson is a 
scientist who 
develops an interest 
. in Schwarzenegger , 
while he develops an interest in having a baby. 
"We could really camp it up 
and go for cheap laughs, but 
it's not like that," says 
Reitman. "It's not silly. It's 
under control, and it evolves 
in a beautiful way." 
( ovember 23.) 
ora Ephron's latest, 
Lifesavers , takes place in a 
Venice, Californja, suicide­
prevention center on 
Christmas Eve. Word from 
the set is that Juliette Lewis 
gives one of her funniest, 
most appealing 
performances . Steve Martin 
is merely effortlessly good.

NEW VORl< FILM 
FESTIVAL Kenneth Branagh brings to 
life Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein. Expect a nerve­
rattling performance from 
Robert De iro as the 
monster. Expect the beautiful 
Helena Bonham Carter to be 
frightened. And expect a 
buffed Branagh to deliver as 
many or more Gothic chills 
and swooning romance than 
Francis Ford Coppola's 
wigged-out , blood-soaked 
1992 take on Bram Stoker's 
Dracula. (November 4.) Ralph Fiennes, Christopher McDonald, John Tllrtllrro ill 'Qlliz Show.' TWO OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE 
year open and close the 
festival: Pulp Fiction and 
Hoop Dreams, an exceptional 
documentary that looks at 
five years in the life of 
talented high-school athletes 
dreaming of the NBA. 
James Carville and Mary 
Matalin might enjoy 
Speechless, a political comedy 
about two rival speechwriters 
(Michael Keaton and Geena 
Davis) who fall in love. 
Which is the Democrat , and 
which is the Republican? 
"Geena's the Democrat, " says 
co-star Christopher Reeve, 
"and Michael will basically 
write for anybody-whoever 
pays the most." And Reeve's 
role? "['m Geena Davis's 
fiance, a war correspondent 
known as Baghdad Bob. 
Whether there's any 
resemblance to the Scud 
Stud, I leave you to guess." 
(December 16.) 
The plot of Star Trek: 
Generations seems sensibly 
action-oriented. A rip in time 
brings together Captains Kirk 
(William Shatner) and Picard 
(Patrick Stewart); they unite, in tum, against a madman 
(Malcolm McDowell) who 
threatens the universe. 
Director David Carson pooh­
poohs any suggestion that 
other cast members might be 
unhappy with its focus. "[ 
think the cast is very wisely 
thinking, Well, if we make 
this into a wonderful movie, 
then there will be a lot more 
movies which will 
hopefully focus on 
the other characters." 
(November) 8.) 
In The War, Jon 
Avnet's follow-up to 
Fried Green 
Tomatoes , there's 
more than one battle 
going on. A father 
(Kevin Costner, in a 
supporting role) tries 
to adjust after 
returning from the 
war in Vietnam, 
while a group of 
kids-including 
Elijah Wood-fight 
over a treehouse. 
Avnet described one 
boy with an especially 
creative approach to 
acting. "We would sit 
there and wonder, 
How is he going to 
find another way to 
hide his face from the 
camera? It was 
amazing." Did the 
kid ever loosen up? "Nope. 
He hid his face the whole 
movie." (November) ).)

CAT EGO R V 
Ed Wood, DIRECTOR TIM 
Burton's black-and-white 
homage to the cross-dressing 
auteur behind awful fifties 
movies like Plan 9 From 
Outer Space and Glen or 
Glenda, is odd and 
endearing. Notable among 
the terrific supporting cast is 
Martin Landau as a 
morphine-addicted Bela 
Lugosi and Bill Murray as 
66 NEW YORK/SEPTEMBER 12, 1994 Bunny Breckinridge . Sarah 
Jessica Parker plays Dolores, 
the girlfriend of Wood's 
(Johnny Depp) who never 
quite got over seeing him in 
drag-just as Parker's never 
gotten over Depp. "Johnny 
looks, by the way, beautiful, 
which is disheartening ," she 
says. "He's so beautiful as a 
man and then he's so 
beautiful as a woman, and 
you think, I can't compete." 
(September 28.) 
SMALL BUT 
GOO D 
I Like It Like That, ABOUT 
the travails of 
a young black-and­
Latino couple, is a 
terrific debut for Darnell 
Martin. (October 14.) 
British director Ken 
Loach delivers another 
wrenching drama, and 
Crissy Rock gives an 
amazing performance in 
the fact-based Ladybird, 
Ladybird. (December 9.) 
With Red, Krzysztof 
Kieslowski concludes his 
trilogy based on the colors of 
the French flag, ending on a 
marvelous and inspired grace 
note. ( ovember 25.) 
Frank Darabont delivers a 
promising feature-film debut 
with The Shawshank 
Redemption , the Stephen King 
story of a convicted murderer 
(Tim Robbins) and his 
friendship with a prison lifer 
IrelleJacob in 'Red." There's equally intriguing 
fare during the run of the 
festival, September 23 to 
October 9. Hal Hartley's 
latest, Amateur, has Isabelle 
Huppert as a former nun 
who writes for a porn 
magazine. Already pegged as 
a crowd-pleasing favorite is 
Strawberry and Chocolate, a 
comedy set in Havana that 
details the romance between 
David, an uptight college 
student, and Diego, an older, 
openly gay, and far more 
cosmopolitan man. Italian

There's another Stephen

from the novel Dolores 
Claiborne. Kathy Bates is a

(October 28.) 
The supremely talented 
Meryl Streep, reportedly tired 
of conventiona l Meryl Streep

big grosses and the clout that

(September 30.)

of health-obsessed cereal 
magnate John Kellogg 
(Anthony Hopkins) is served 
up by director Alan Parker. 
Taking The Road to Wellville is 
Matthew Broderick, who 
thought of his character as "a 
5-year-old , a little kid who 
had failed his potty training 
and was sent someplace to be 
fixed." At one point, to help 
him focus, Broderick used a 
vivid memory from his 
childhood. "I was painting 
with a lot of intensity," says 
Broderick, "painting a big 
piece of paper on an easel, 
and spilling so much paint 
that it was running all over 
my shirt, my shorts, and 
running down my leg, and it 
gave me some kind of clue." 
(October 28.) 
Twenty-three-year old 
Kevin Smith wrote and 
directed Clerks, an audience 
fave at the Sundance festival

of two friends. One is a fairly 
responsible clerk at a

a stunningly rude video-store 
employee. (October 21.)

will turn him into a star. 
Maybe Street Fighter will do 
the trick. It marks the 
directing debut of Steven E. 
de Souza, the scribe behind 
Die Hard and its sequels. No 
stranger to giving orders (he 
worked as a producer on 
Simon & Simon and Knight 
Rider), De Souza says his 
lawyers suggested he take an 
order from the United 
Nations and eliminate 
references to it in the movie. 
"We showed the U.N. 
successfully waging a war, 
rescuing hostages, and 
feeding hungry children," he 
says. "I guess it was so 
contrary to their public image 
that they worried people 
would get confused ." (December 23.) 
DUELING

WHY REDO Miracle on 34th 
Street? Producer John 
Hughes has argued that the 
original had a terrific Santa 
in Edmund Gwenn but was 
noticeably lacking elsewhere. 
He's countered early 
criticism with the dead-on 
casting of Richard 
Attenborough as Saint Nick. 
(November.) 
Home Improvement 's Tim 
Allen plays a divorced father 
who temporarily takes over 
for Santa. In The Santa 
Clause, that entails battling a 
weight gain of about 200 
pounds and handling labor 
relations with all those elves. 
"I think we came up with a
