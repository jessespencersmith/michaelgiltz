He's had a home there for years (infact, a good chunk of Dave Chappelle's Block Party was filmed there)but when Chappelle says he loves the town and is staying put, this ispicked up by the traditional media as some sort of new development.And now that time has passed, I have to say I feel a little more empathyfor Chappelle about the demise of his show. Not in how he handled it orjust disappeared without even phoning his WIFE until he was in Africa,not in his annoying "white people were laughing too much at my jokes"excuses, none of that. But seeing the truly lame, bottom of the barrelscraps that Comedy central put on the air, and watching Chappelle'sold buddies feed off the carcass of those scraps for a few more bucksand few more minutes of fame, I felt angry at them too. That junkshould never have seen the light of day. Chappelle was right about onething: the new season wasn't going to measure up and he needed topull the plug.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
