            <p>T H U R S D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 4 ,  2 0 0 7DVD Format War Just Got StupiderThe NYTimes reports that Warner Bros. believes it can help the DVDformat war between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD, two competing formatsthat offer substantially better pictures than regular DVDs but whichhave been met by yawns from consumers. WB is releasing a DVD thatcan hold BOTH formats simultaneously. In other words, you buy"Superman Returns" and don't have to worry which format willultimately triumph the way people did with VHS vs Beta. When oneplayer remains standing, all the DVDs you buy this way will still beplayable on either machine. This sort of helps retailers but doesn't do athing to end the confusion and indifference from consumers. Theycorrectly don't want anything to do with either format until onestandard is set and the prices are lowered. They love their DVDs andsee no reason to replace all of them. In the stupidest arguemnt, WBinsists that its research shows people are willing to pay a premium (ie."just a few extra dollars") to buy these multi-format discs. Really,people who are refusing to buy Blu-Ray and HD-DVD are eager to payEVEN MORE for a DVD that contains both formats they want no partof? How does that make sense? Until they end the format war andmake the price the same as current DVDs, people aren't going to bite.Right now, the NYTimes says, "Superman Returns" on DVD is $20 atBest Buy in regular DVD, $30 for Blu-Ray and $35 for HD-DVD. Onlyan idiot would think people want to pay say $38 for a DVD thatcontains both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. That's almost DOUBLE whatDVDs cost now. DVDs succeeded because they offerered vastly superiorquality to VHS, included tons of extras, were available much quickerand cost a lot less or at most the same. What part of "bargain" doesHollywood not understand?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
