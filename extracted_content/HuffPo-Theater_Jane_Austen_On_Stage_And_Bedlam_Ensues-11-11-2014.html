Bedlam Ensues!THE SEAGULL *** out of **** SENSE & SENSIBILITY *** 1/2 out of **** BEDLAM AT THE SHEEN CENTEROthers -- led of course by the New York Times -- have acclaimed Bedlam as a theatrical company of exceptionalquality. See their latest productions of Chekhov's The Seagull and a new adaptation of Jane Austen's Senseand Sensibility done in repertory and you'll immediately know why. They're a strong ensemble with versatileactors and a keen intelligence devoted to the pure theater extolled by Cheek By Jowl and others right up therecent Peter and The Starcatcher. It's theater that exults in the marriage of their talents and your imagination tocreate something special that needs no elaborate sets or frippery. The Chekhov is good (no small feat). TheAusten is delightful and near masterful. And I will be certain to see whatever they do next.You know the stories. In The Seagull, a famed actress heads to the country for a rest, only to have her petulantson Konstantin throw a fit when she giggles at his "play" and her lover -- a writer who, she believes, should bethrilled to have her -- grows besotted with a much younger ingenue. Meanwhile, the son is the object of affectionfor Masha, a woman he cannot see while she in turn is stalked by an obdurately dull school teacher namedMedvedenko who makes less than $2000 a year and has no source of conversation other than the injustice ofsuch a thing. It does not end well.In Sense and Sensibility, the Dashwood women are thrown onto hard times by a weak-willed half-brother andhis viperish wife. The willful younger sister Marianne is admired by the sober and deeply worthy ColonelBrandon but has her head turned by the dashing and feckless John Willoughby. The reserved and appealingolder sister Elinor forms a deep attachment to the modest and equally reserved Edward Ferrars. But all seemsto conspire against them and they are so careful of their emotions you despair of them even beginning acourtship much less consummating one. It ends very well because of course this is Austen. Her greatness lies inmaking the happy ending not inevitable but real and wholly earned.Both plays begin and end with a dance. Ending with a dance is an Elizabethan tradition carried on by the Globein London and it's a delightful one. In The Seagull, it feels a bit random and beside the point, though not abother. In Sense & Sensibility, it is integrated more wholly into the show: the cast dances around in moderndress and then slowly disrobes their outer garments to reveal period dress as their dance reverts from modernfree-for-all to the more formal style of Austen's era.Indeed, many of the directorial flourishes in Seagull feel a little unnecessary. The Russian play features adramatic set change from act one to act two. In act one we are watching via stadium seating as the mostlyoutdoor scenes are performed. In act two, we move to a semi-circular seating around the action that is muchmore intimate and involving. While the staging would have been trickier, you only wish the whole show had beendone that way because it's so well-suited to the work. Jarringly, the young would-be playwright Konstantin(played by the director Ken Tucker) pops up in a silly red devil costume that feels more low-brow Will Ferrellthan witty.But these are minor concerns since most of the actors are spot-on and immediately involving. Vaishnavi Sharmais wonderful as the self-involved star, making her more human and less indifferent than I've seen before without</p>

The scene whereshe opens herself to him and we see the vain actress slip away and the insecure woman of a certain ageremains is very moving. Up and down the cast holds our attention, from the doctor (Nigel Gore) right down toMasha, the daughter of the estate's manager who is forlornly in love with Konstantin. She's played by AndrusNichols, who was so compelling that when my guest and I wondered who might play the lead in Sense we bothhoped it would be her (and had our hopes confirmed). Even the often ponderous teacher Medvedenko is playedby Samantha Steinmetz with wonderfully droll comic timing worthy of Ellen Degeneres at her best.The weak links unfortunately are Tucker as Konstantin and Laura Baranik as the aspiring actress Nina who iswooed and destroyed by the writer Trigorin. Partially, it's casting. We accept Steinmetz as a male teacher butsomehow Tucker's size and age make it hard to see him as the son of Sharma. And Baranik isn't quite up to thedevastation of Nina. This means the final scene where Tucker and Baranik survey their shattered lives fallssomewhat flat. But a solid Seagull is no mean feat and the flat comic flourishes felt like minor missteps. Both ofthese actors fare much better in Sense & Sensibility.Indeed, almost everyone fares much better in Sense and Sensibility. The set design is immediately promising: itincludes elaborate floor to ceiling window panels on wheels that can be moved around to create a wall orseparate areas or pulled back to frame a scene and allow outsiders to peer in on the action like the busybodiesthat pepper Austen's novels. Another key feature are chairs on wheels. While Tucker clearly did very good workwith the actors on Seagull, his every directorial intention is superbly successful in Sense & Sensibility. Theaudience lines the walls on two sides with the action taking place in the middle. He's aided at every stage by thescenic design of John McDermott, the costumes of Angela Huff, the lighting of Les Dickert and especially thechoreography of Alexandra Beller.The show begins with the dance I described. Then the actors launch into a babble of conversation, each of themaddressing audience members with the currency of the times: gossip. Those simple white chairs on wheelsprove wonderfully versatile. During a dinner party, the actors are arrayed around the space a large table wouldoccupy. But when one character begins to timidly offer a tidbit of social news, others swoop in like sharkssmelling blood; they herd her off into a corner, forcing every vital drop of news from her lips. At other times,when say Elinor hears distressing news, her chair is wheeled around and around across the large rectangularstage in dizzying dismay. A carriage ride is handled deftly and amusingly without straining for laughs. A scene oftwo young women chatting with superficial politeness is staged like a duel, with each of them at opposite ends ofthe stage on their little white chairs, like gunfighters facing off on the main street of a town. A dozen othermoments are handled with similar ingenuity and cleverness.The boisterous and essentially harmless if overwhelming Mrs. Jennings is an ideal fit for Tucker, who here useshis imposing size to marvelous effect without ever stopping to caricature. If anything, she's more delightfullymenacing than a figure of fun. When the Dashwood women meet her and their other relations, Tucker simplyhas them bark out howls to indicate the pack of dogs that follow them everywhere, a neatly disorienting effectthat is hilarious and slightly unnerving at the same time as you almost look here and there for the animals thatseem to have invaded the stage.And the cast rises to the occasion of Austen's brilliant novel and this excellent adaptation by Kate Hamill (whoplays the passionate Marianne). Gore is very good as the Doctor in Seagull but he's even better as the movingColonel Brandon. His monologue detailing the dastardly life of John Willoughby may be the show's emotionalhigh point. Similarly, John Russell is fine as the prickly estate manager in Seagull but really good as both thedashing Willoughby and the spineless half-brother of our heroines. (One scene where he enthusiastically greetshis sisters sans wife is a bit split personality; perhaps he should seem a tad more apologetic in his enthusiasticgreeting? Otherwise, his work is impeccable.)I can go up and down the line. Thanks to Tucker's inventive but always emotionally motivated direction and</p>

Steinmetz scores again in two wonderfully opposite turns as Mrs. Dashwood and thesilly Anne Steele. Baranik fares much better as the villains Fanny Dashwood and Lucy Steele than she did asNina; nastiness suits her. Andrus Nichols fulfills my expectations as the intelligent and sensible -- almost toosensible -- Elinor. Jason O'Connell is sweetly tentative as Edward Ferrars and his scenes with Elinor arebrimming with unspoken affection. Sharma -- the best thing in Seagull -- is strong as the littlest Dashwood, a rolethat might easily have been played too broadly and for laughs.But here the playwright modestly lets herself down. The willful Marianne is not an easy role and while Hamillshines as adaptor, she is fine but not exceptional as that impetuous young woman who must maintain oursympathy while being an utter dolt, not to mention emotionally imploding at various key moments.One can sense director Tucker's leanings towards broad humor leading him astray in Seagull. That tendency isin check most of the time in Sense. When an intended betrothal enrages the Ferrars, the scene where they pileon in a fit of indignation worthy of a rugby scrum works well because it's a bit of gossip being related to a thirdparty. The exaggeration is amusing. If it were the actual scene unfolding, the staging would be ludicrous and outof sorts with the tone of the show.Unfortunately, that pratfall instinct overwhelms the finale. Elinor and Edward are finally meeting, finally free todeclare their love. She's just had the supreme disappointment of misunderstanding that Edward has marriedanother. He gently, diffidently, tentatively, sweetly clears up the confusion...and she runs screaming from theroom. This moment of slapstick tragically robs us of emotion at the finale. It is technically faithful to the text.Austen writes, "Elinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed,burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would never cease." But what reads well does not always playwell. And on stage we've just enjoyed a burst of high comedy. What the climax needs is heart. The impeccable1995 film adaptation shows how this scene can have tremendous impact when played quietly. If Tucker andNichols are looking for a combination of laughter and emotion, of seeing Elinor burst forth like a dam as thetears flow in a manner amusing but touching, well they haven't found it yet. Another laugh, finally, is not what'sneeded here.So this Sense and Sensibility gets the humor and certainly the gossipy, unforgiving world of high society to a "t."Its staging is -- with that glaring exception -- impeccable and truly inventive. It's worthy of a much longer run on abigger stage and it ranks as one of the best shows of the year. But it does not move you nearly as much as thenovel does and a great adaptation should. Still, it's only a few tweaks and -- my apologies to the excellentadaptor -- perhaps a switch in casting away.Already, it ranks as perhaps the greatest stage adaptation of this novel in history. That's not as high praise as itshould be since I slowly realized how very rarely Jane Austen has actually been adapted to the stage at least onBroadway and as far as I can tell the West End. Even though her novels are marvels of dialogue and characterand brimming with plot, they have almost never made it onto the boards, despite an endless stream of versionson TV and at the movies. It's certainly the first time I've seen a stage production of any of her work. Here andthere a musical version is attempted, but even that rarely. Austen's sightings on Broadway are rare to the pointof bemusement. A stage adaptation of Pride & Prejudice ran for six months beginning in 1935 (and was turnedinto the marvelous 1940 film starring Laurence Olivier). In 1959, a musical spin on Pride & Prejudice ran for justover two months. And that's it. What can possibly explain it?It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single novel in possession of a good plot must be in want of anadaptation. Finally, Sense & Sensibility has received a theatrical one worthy of it.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical ***Rodney King ***</p>
