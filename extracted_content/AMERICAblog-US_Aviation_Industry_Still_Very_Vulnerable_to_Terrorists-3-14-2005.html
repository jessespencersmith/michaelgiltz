3/14/2005 11:45:00 AMMore than $12 billion has been spent on beefing up security inthe aviation industry, but according to a new governmentreport covered in the NYT, there are still a LOT of holes."Despite a huge investment in security, the American aviationsystem remains vulnerable to attack by Al Qaeda and otherjihadist terrorist groups, with noncommercial planes andhelicopters offering terrorists particularly tempting targets, aconfidential government report concludes," says the NYT.One sad, simple fact they don't mention: Almost four yearsafter 9/11 and they STILL don't have integrated watch lists thatare checked by either the airlines or government officials tomake sure that the terrorists we KNOW about don't simplybook flights on major airlines under their own names. Yep, theinfo obtained by the FBI, CIA, NSA and other governmentagencies is STILL not provided on a master list to someoneoverseeing who is let into this country or booking flights onairlines. It happened before. No reason to think it won't happenagain until we get our act together.
