6/08/2005 06:40:00 PMIt makes it hard to debate the issues when the MSM doesn'teven get its facts right. This Washington Post description fromyesterday's press conference is quite typical:In their first visit together at the White House since winningreelection in campaigns dominated by Iraq and U.S. foreignpolicy, Bush and Blair trumpeted a new U.S. plan to spend$674 million more on famine relief....The only problem? It's completely wrong. Bush did NOT increasefunding by $674 million. All he did was release money that hadalready been allocated by Congress. This is bad on many levels.Most casual viewers will believe what the media reported, that the USdug deep and offered up an extra $674 million to help the hungry.The truth is that the US is the most miserly of the majorindustrialized powers -- we give FAR less in foreign aid than everyother country in the G8.And yesterday Blair came hat in hand and said this is vitallyimportant both to the world and to me politically and Bush sent himpacking without giving Blair a single red cent. So the media missesBush's lack of loyalty to an ally, misses Blair's shame, missesAmerica's unChristian refusal to help our fellow neighbors andmislead the public into thinking our government was doing the rightthing.What can you do? Write to your local paper if they got it wrong andask when they're going to run a correction and explain why they gotsuch a basic fact wrong. The NYT and other outlets quotedadministration officials the day of the press conference explaining the$674 million and that it wasn't new funding, so why did everyone getit so wrong?
