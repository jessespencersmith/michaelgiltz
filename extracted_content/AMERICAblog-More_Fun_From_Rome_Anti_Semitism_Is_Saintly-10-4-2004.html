10/04/2004 09:49:00 PMAs if trying to keep Spain a theocracy instead of a true democracywasn't bad enough, the Pope beatified two highly controversialfigures, moving them that much closer to sainthood.The lucky winners? (They're not exactly in rarified company, sincePJPII has cranked out saints during his papacy at an indecent pace.)1. Emperor Charles I -- the last Austro-Hungarian emperor and aman whose troops under his command used weapons of massdestruction -- poison gas -- during WWI. His miracle? (You gotta havea miracle to get to sainthood.) The not-so-dignified act of healing aBrazilian nun's varicose veins! Why a nun would be praying toEmperor Charles I to cure her varicose veins remains a mystery.2. The lovely 19th century German mystic Sister Anna KatharinaEmmerick -- she's the lunatic (almost literally) whose madlyanti-Semitic descriptions of the Passion of the Christ deeplyinspired...you guessed it, Mel Gibson. Not to mention lots of otherfanatics who have called for the destruction of the Jews and used herrantings to back that up as religiously inspired. Her miracle?Presumably Mel Gibson's bank account.Slobodan Miloscevic -- there's hope yet.
