9/30/2004 03:08:00 AMHere's a comforting essay in The Washington Monthly by BenjaminWallace-Wells that compares the Republican Party of today to anotherdecaying empire that once held sway over our nation."The truth is, for all its apparent strength, the modern RepublicanParty has worked itself into a position of profound and growing decay.Worried Republicans are right to look to the past to help sort out theirfuture. But the right date isn't 1994 or 1904. It's the late 1970s--andthe party to look at isn't the Republicans, but the Democrats. Like theDemocrats of that period, the current version of the Republican Partyis supremely powerful but ideologically incoherent, run largely by andfor special interests and increasingly alienated from the broadervoting public. Today's GOP is headed for a profound crackup. The onlyquestions are when, exactly, the decline will start--and how long itwill last."Okay, maybe this just speaks to me because I profoundly rejectedthe Dems in the late Seventies, early Eighties (slaves to the unionsand special interests!) and today I profoundly reject the Repubs(slaves to the religious far right and special interests!). Does it speakto you?
