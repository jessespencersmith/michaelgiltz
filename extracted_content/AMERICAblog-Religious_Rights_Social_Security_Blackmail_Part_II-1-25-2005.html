1/25/2005 09:27:00 PMI want to echo a point in our thread about the Religious Right'sblackmailing of Bush. As you know, they threatened to withholdsupport for Social Security reform unless Bush heartily backedthe anti-gay, anti-marriage amendment.Now think about that: if they truly believed Social Security wasin a crisis (it's not) and that Bush's ill-defined plan was going toprotect the elderly from falling into poverty, going hungry andhomeless, etc. how could they possibly threaten NOT to backit? How could any Christian reject a plan they believed in thatwould feed old people simply for cynical political purposes?On the other hand, if they thought Social Security was fine,how could they in good conscience tamper with it to advance apolitical agenda and risk plunging old people into hunger anddespair? If they could get prayer back in the schools (or basicscience out), would they really be willing to accept Bushdoubling the number of senior citizens living below the povertyline?Where or where are the activist religious groups on the left thatcan criticize these shameful cynical tactics with moralauthority? They might just convince people that in politics GodDOES take sides -- He's on the side of the weak and thehungry and the helpless and He always has been.
