John Tartaglia, the adorable star of the Tony-bound Avenue QJ 
talks about the second job he's taken on since coming out: 
ambassador of gay understanding By Michael Gillz 
or star John Tartaglia, coming 
out in The Advocate right be­
fore his first musical , Avenue Q, 
opened on Broadway-to the 
best reviews of any musical this 
season-turned out to be both no big 
deal and the smartest thing he ever did. 
"When I first did the article for The 
Advocate ," says 26-year-old Tartaglia, "I 
was really nervous because, well, I'm not really a name at all. I don't have any 
exposure, This is my first national mag­
azine. What if I hurt my career? And the 
funny thing is, it's helped me more than 
anything else." 
Indeed, he and the Avenue Q puppet 
Rod-who's a closeted gay Republi­
can-have become ambassadors not 
just for the word-of-mouth hit about 
puppets and people starting out in life 
THE ADVOCATE 162 I MAY 25, 2004 on New York's lower east side but also 
for the gay community at large. With 
Avenue Q a favorite to earn a passel of 
Tony nominations on May 10, that pop­
ularity is only likely to increase. 
Tartaglia and Rod have appeared on 
Hollywood Squares and in a solo spot­
light for the actor at the Ars Nova 
Broadway Spotlight series. Tartaglia 
has also been asked to host or appear 
in events like the Broadway Cares/Eq­
uity Fights AIDS benefit, the Broadway 
Bares show, the Easter Bonnet benefit, 
New Faces of Broadway at Carnegie 
Hall (with costar Stephanie D'Abruz­
zo), the local Emmys, and even a Neil 
Sedaka tribute. 
Job offers for voice-over work in ani­
mation and possible movie and TV 
deals have also been forthcoming, 
though after a year Tartaglia is having 
such fun performing in Avenue Q, both 
off-Broadway and on, that he's not 
ready to walk away yet. 
Avenue Q's good karma has also 
rubbed off on the show's director, Jason 
Moore-who is also out and has been 
deluged with offers, including a starry 
Broadway revival of Steel Magnolias in 
the fall, a TV movie musical version of 
The Hunchhack oj Notre Dame with out 
producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron 
(The Reagans, Chicago), and a series 
development deal with Fox. 
The 33-year-old director says it's 
been a trippy delight seeing Tartaglia 
and Rod become so popular. 
"Seeing Rod on CNN," says Moore, 
"that was one of my favorite moments, 
especially when the ticker read [the 
name of the character) 'Mrs. Thistlet­
wat.' " Tartaglia was already attached to 
the project when Moore joined, but the 
director quickly saw how special his af­
fable star was. 
"He's an exceptionally , especially tal­
ented kid," says Moore. "That's why he 
can carry the show. I'm just thrilled 
people are recognizing him for all he 
has to offer." 
Avenue Q has certainly proved to be 
a desirable address for its star. 
"It's opened a lot of doors for me," 
says Tartaglia. "A year and a half ago I 
was walking down Broadway and look­
ing up at the theaters and thinking, Oh, 
my God, that's my dream to be there. I 
was just praying that someday I'd get to 
walk through the stage door and work 
at a Broadway theater."</p>
<p>As he points out, the puppets 
make this show one of the few 
where the characters make 
sense outside of the show. 
(You wouldn't want Mama 
Rose hosting an awards event, 
would you?) And the popularity 
of Rod in particular is no sur­
prise to Tartaglia. 
"Rod's story line appeals so 
much to people," he says. "Not 
only is he such a sweet and sym­
pathetic character, but even if 
you have no experience with 
gay people at all, you can still 
relate to him. Everyone has a 
part of themselves they struggle 
to be honest about." 
Together, the relaxed gay 
leading man and the anxious 
gay puppet on his sleeve send a 
powerful message about the re­
wards of being out. And Tar­
taglia takes every opportunity to 
communicate that message in 
person. One of his favorite ap­
pearances was True Colors, a 
weekend retreat for gay and les-Tartaglia with gay Avenue Q puppet Rod: changing hearts and minds bian kids and their families and 
friends in Connecticut. 
"Being up in Connecticut was 
really a wake-up call," says 
Tartaglia. "Here I am in my 20s 
worried about being open, and 
here are these kids who are, like, 
14 and saying, 'Yeah, I'm gay.' It 
was really amazing. There were 
about 1,500 kids and their fami­
lies or friends. [I walked] through 
this college campus and sawall 
these kids who are 13 to 21, and if 
they're not out, they're question­
ing. And it was just joy. There 
were no kids being harassed be­
cause they were different. No one 
was left out. It was very emotion­
al for me because of how beauti­
ful it is that it exists." 
Here's hoping that Tartaglia 
and Rod have another emotional 
moment on June 10, when the 
Tony awards are handed out .•
