            <p>S AT U R D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 4 ,  2 0 0 6TV Preview: Ice SkatingThis weekend, they'll bechoosing the ice skating Olympicteam, so ice skating iseverywhere on TV. Look for it atESPN2 at 6 p.m. and ABC at 8p.m. Sunday it's back on ESPN2at 1 p.m. (followed by women'scollege gymnastics at 2:30 p.m.)and concludes on ABC from 4p.m. to 6 p.m. That's a lot oftriple lutzes!On the men's side, the big newsis Johnny Weir, skating betterthan ever. [Photo by EileenBlass/USA Today.] Even ice skating officials call him "flamboyant," andsince we're talking about the world of men's ice skating you know that'ssaying something. He wears a swan-like costume that Bjork would beproud of to skate to the music "The Swan," complete with a red gloveon one hand that represents the beak. Weir calls the glove "Camille."And now Weir is in trouble for continually using drug references todescribe the routines they perform. Per USA Today, which has the bestice skating coverage of any newspaper in the country:On Thursday, he compared the fans' reaction to his slowerprogram and another skater's more lively one by saying, "Thisone they kind of sat back and had their cognac and cigarettesand relax. His was more like a vodka shot, let's snort coke kindof thing."Top that, Bode Miller! It's only a matter of time before Weir gets hisown reality show.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 1:09 PM
