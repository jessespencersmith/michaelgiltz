Seeing Russian aristocrats bored in the country feelsas natural as seeing some locals in New Orleans getting drunk or workers in New York getting unionized. Here,the wife of an older and boringly dependable man (Anthony Edwards of ER) is filled with ennui, but not to thepoint of stifling inaction a la Anton Chekhov's plays, which followed long after this one was first written andpublished. Happily, Natalya (Taylor Schilling of Orange Is The New Black) takes a great deal of action. She flirtsand teases along her "friend" Rakitin (the very appealing Peter Dinklage of Game Of Thrones), who is clearlyand deeply in love with her. It passes the time. Then Natalya falls hopelessly head over heels in love with herson's handsome young tutor (a miscast Mike Faist).Unfortunately, Natalya intimidates this upright, seemingly uptight young man of depressingly impeccablecharacter. He remains at military-like attention whenever she's around. But what's this? The tutor noticeablyrelaxes in the presence of her ward, Vera (Megan West). Vera is pretty and, while Natalya is young, Vera isyounger still and more along the social lines of the tutor. Natalya takes more action: she tries to marry off Vera,she flies kites and giggles and spends as much time with the tutor as possible and all the while she lets poorRakitin suffer at her feet.A Month In The Country was originally a five act play but this significantly trimmed version translated by JohnChristopher Jones keeps things moving along at a brisk, even indecent pace. A good deal of talent is onstageand the chance to see this work in the intimate space of CSC is welcome. But the successes here seemindividual ones. Director Erica Schmidt hasn't brought many of the minor characters into focus or given the showany overall cohesion. That coupled with the young lovers being the weakest performers here keep this a modestpleasure.Still, there are pleasures to be had. Rakitin is a rather passive character in this telling, but Dinklage brings a fullcomplement of passion and intelligence to his portrayal. One can't help thinking Natalya is making a big mistake.Schilling -- who I've never seen on stage before -- doesn't have the same nuance but she felt fully in commandof this broad brushstroke of a character and remained a compelling presence throughout. (The striking andlovingly detailed costumes of Tom Broecker certainly helped in that regard.)Thomas Jay Ryan however stole the show as the cynical but sweet doctor. As so often happens, you'll beforgiven for thinking the play is really about him. His wooing of Annabella Sciorra is the highpoint of the evening.Still, Schmidt's lack of insight on the play lets most minor characters suffer. The servants ran around in thebackground but it was hard to get a grasp on their relation to one another or their masters. Elizabeth Franzbrought great presence to the role of the mother in law but again I'm darned if I know what her actualrelationship is to her son or daughter in law or anyone else for that matter. And the two young lovers provemissed opportunities. Faist never seems to connect with the role he's supposed to be playing while Westconnects too much. She's over-the-top as the giggly teen in act one (her head and hands are constantly moving)but does better when bitter and reserved in act two.</p>

He doesn't love either of the women who yearn for him but will happily take what'soffered? He loves the woman but knows he can't have her? He loves the girl but feels unworthy? He isindifferent to them all? Take your pick; watching this production, I haven't a clue.That confusion extends to the set. Rather strikingly for the intimate space of CSC, there's the shell of a roomsuspended over the stage -- we see three walls with windows and doors and a front with just a scrim so we cansee into it. I was initially captivated but as the show progressed, I kept wondering exactly why this unavoidableproduction design choice loomed over the stage and the proceedings. I could take a stab at several differentreasons but none suffice. Nor was it appealing enough on its own not to demand a reason for being. Surelyevery element of a show must serve a purpose or be eliminated so as not to distract.The central stage by Mark Wendland was serviceable and trim, with actors bringing in and removing modestpieces of furniture as needed. But above them, always, was this shell of a room hovering over their actions. Aroom without a purpose, it didn't enclose them or open up their world to new perspectives. It was much like thisproduction without a purpose -- lucky enough to have some very talented actors deliver what they could from thetext, but without any new perspective on the play as a whole.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2_____________Thanks for reading.
