            <p>May 17, 2008Welcome To Cannes 2008I'm back at the Cannes Film Festival for The Advocate. I'll keepan eye out for any queer content, of course, as well as mymodest stabs at the gay social life and mostly provide a bit ofthe flavor of attending Cannes, still the most glamorous and funfilm festival in the world. It's as if an entire year of movies andthe Academy Awards were condensed down to 12 days: youmight watch anywhere from 20 to 40 films, plus shorts, parties,and networking and on the last day they celebrate the best.Sean Penn is the head of the jury, which should guarantee Artwill reign supreme even more than usual. What I've got my eyeon: Argentina's "Leonera" is a woman-in-prison movie, ClintEastwood's period piece "The Changeling" with Angelina Jolieand Amy Ryan, director Lucretia Mortel's followup to "TheHoly Girl," Abel Ferrera's ode to the Chelsea Hotel, the gay teentennis player in love with his tutor flick "Elevre Libre," KellyReichardt's "Wendy and Lucy," several shorts and above allTerence Davies. The brilliant out British director of modernclassics "The Long Day Closes" and "Distant Voices, Still Lives,"not to mention "The House of Mirth" with Gillian Anderson,Davies is here with a documentary about his hometownLiverpool. Anyone who has seen his films will know howexciting the prospect of a new one from Davies can be.Posted at 12:39 PM in Cannes 2008 | PermalinkTrackBackTrackBack URL for this entry:http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341ca4b653ef00e552485ee58834Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Welcome To Cannes2008:CommentsVisit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement
