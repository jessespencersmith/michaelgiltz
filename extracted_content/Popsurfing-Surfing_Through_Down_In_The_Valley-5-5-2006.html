            <p>F R I D AY,  M AY  0 5 ,  2 0 0 6Surfing Through "Down In The Valley"This faux Western starring Edward Norton opens today in limitedrelease. Below is the complete text of my initial reaction to the filmwhen I saw it at Cannes last year. I'm actually heading for London NextFriday and then Cannes the following week where I'll be blogging lessregularly but more glamorously from the best film festival in the world.Peter sallet -- the composer of the film -- stumbled on my piece andwas friendly enough to send along an email thanking me and letting meknow about an upcoming album. He's a real talent, as is mosteverypone connected to this worthy if flawed project. And now, mypiece:Down in the Valley ** ½ -- Can you like a movie that doesn’t work?That’s certainly how I feel about this modern western (of sorts),starring Edward Norton as a drifter/cowboy who shows up in LA andcharms the pants of Evan Rachel Wood. Writer/director DavidJacobson echoes all sorts of films -- “Midnight Cowboy” and “TaxiDriver” most prominently – and Norton is just terrific as the aw-shuckscowboy that you can’t quite decide if he’s a nutso or for real. Actually,everyone is good, including Rory Culkin as Wood’s timid little brotherand David Morse as their quick-tempered dad who hasn’t a clue abouthow to rein in the stubborn Wood. Much too much plot (Norton’s dadis an Hasidic jew? Oy.) and cut the way too soft ending scene. As for thescene where Norton stands in front of a mirror wearing his holster andgun, talking to himself in tough guy mode: my friend Stephen said itwell, “You can’t do that. Robert DeNiro owns the copyright to that andyou’re infringing.” Truly, it’s a no-win move, even with someone astalented as Norton. (And sadly, the earlier part of the scene, where hegoofs around on his own and has a mock shoot-out with bad guys likean eight year old kid, tells us everything we know and is much better.)Despite it’s flaws, this is a distinctive film and Norton was right tochampion it and the director.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 5:22 PM
