I stil wish Christian Bale had become the newBond instead of the new Batman. But if it gives him juice and lets himkeep doing the right indie films and interesting studio movies, thengreat. He has the magician movie "The Prestige" this fall, he's currentlyshooting the wacky Bob Dylan-esque movie by Todd Haynes and thenup next: a remake of "3:10 To Yuma." I don't really see the need for aremake of that movie. It's sensational as it is. But I will say my firstinstinct was Crowe as the rancher and Bale as the outlaw he must get tothe train without being killed. I guess physically it works better theother way around, but Bale has a sneaky snake oil salesman side to himthat doesn't get used enough.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
