4/26/2005 10:54:00 AMThis is kind of sad. The bad news coming out of Iraq has beenso relentless ever since the elections that the closest the UScan come to some good news is "almost" capturing theinsurgent Zarqawi. I guess Bush has to take what he can. Hereare some other possible headlines he can suggest to the MSM:Bush Almost Guts Social SecurityTom DeLay Almost Neuters Ethics Committee While Claiming ToCall For Investigation Of HimselfCheney Almost SmilesAny suggestions?
