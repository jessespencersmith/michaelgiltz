10/26/2004 03:09:00 AMA rather dry New York Times article adds further details to whatwe've known for a while: Bush thinks he is above the law and hasbeen ignoring the Geneva Convention in Iraq by sending non-Iraqis toundisclosed locations for torture or worse by "allies" like Saudi Arabia(gotta ignore our principles to defend our principles) or hiding themfrom the International Red Cross. (They don't use Guantanamo Bayfor the real baddies because they know the world is watching.)But here's the kicker: Rumsfeld lied to the American people aboutwhat they've been doing. We've been transporting non-Iraqiscaptured in Iraq out of the country (which is a war crime under theGeneva Convention) for a year and a half."As recently as May 2004, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeldreiterated in public testimony the administration's view that"everyone in Iraq who was a military person" as well as "the civiliansor criminal elements" who were detained by the American authoritieswould be "treated subject to the Geneva Conventions.""Why doesn't some Congressperson demand Rummy come back tothem and explain why he lied to the American people?
