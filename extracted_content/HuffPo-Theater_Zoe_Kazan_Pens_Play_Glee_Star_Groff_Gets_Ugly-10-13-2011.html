 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Zoe Kazan Pens Play; Glee 's
Groff Gets Ugly
WE LIVE HERE  ** out of ****
CITY CENTER
A common rookie mistake in playwriting is to leave your
audience in the dark. Some plays are about plumbing a
mystery, of course. But when everyone on stage knowsthe painful secret yet simply avoids for pages and pagesspelling out exactly what is going on, it's merely
frustrating.
That's the case in actress Zoe Kazan's new play We Live
Here.  We know sadness looms over the home of Maggie
(a soft-voiced Amy Irving) and Lawrence (the always
dependable Mark Blum). Althea (Jessica Collins) is
getting married to Sandy (Jeremy Shamos) but a quiet tenseness is present whenever her dead twin
sister is mentioned. Suicide is the obvious possibility and eventually we realize that's exactly what
happened. When kid sister Dinah (Betty Gilpin) unexpectedly shows up with a date, it's the family friendand dead sister's one-time romantic partner Daniel (Oscar Isaac). Bride to be Althea promptly faints in
shock. She later claims it's just because she was happy to see him, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
realize they have a past.
It takes a long time to reveal that past to us and of course it revolves around the death of Althea's twin
sister. Until then we spend most of the play watching characters dance around a topic they don't or can'tor won't discuss. The result is not cathartic. Perhaps if the motives of characters were better defined.Dinah might be desperate to wake her family up out of their self-imposed silence. Or she might just like
Daniel. He might be obsessed with this family which has dominated his life -- there's a confusing

<p>reference to the parents sheltering him when he needed it as a kid, though it's unclear exactly what he's
talking about. Is he seducing Dinah just to get back into their lives? Exactly how manipulative or twisted
is he? By the evidence, not very much (though the guy clearly has issues). And Althea is weighed down by
guilt, but her anger is so diffuse it doesn't drive her in interesting or revealing ways. She just lashes out.
The revelations toward the end are not terribly earth-shaking (and the ante could easily have been
upped). A moment of connection at the end is so modest that the audience was actually confused as towhether the play was over or not. They sat in confusion until the actors started walking on stage to take
their bows and hurriedly began to clap. A clearer example of a play not having focus or knowing where
it's headed is hard to imagine.
Kazan also throws in some quirkiness -- such as the flirtatious talk between the engaged couple that
involves hopping around like a bunny rabbit -- that's so out of left field and uninspired it is quickly
forgotten. By and large this is a very traditional play. Scene to scene it's rather confident and the
characters though ill-defined have some good lines and notable details. Irving didn't project well the
night I saw it but in this small space it doesn't matter. She gives her all to a breakdown scene, though it
can't help feeling forced because the play hasn't really earned it. As her husband, Blum is notably
centered and believable. He has a monologue that draws on Greek myth to make some indistinct point
about their dead daughter and manages to deliver it with such compassion you almost feel it meanssomething.
Collins can't quite make sense of Althea while Gilpin is on stronger ground as Dinah. The two men in
their lives are perhaps the best characters since they carry the least weight. Shamos is good as the
understanding fiance who takes everything in his stride (well, almost everything) and Isaac is good as
Daniel (oddly, even more effective in a flashback; don't ask me why).
Director Sam Gold has done what he can with a rather shapeless work. But the set by John Lee Beatty is a
marvel. It's so detailed and convincing and complete you have no problem believing they live here, as the
title states. You get the lay of the land immediately. The living room and study are up front, with the
front door on the left, a staircase in the middle leading to the second floor and a kitchen in the back. It'sall visible and nicely lived in. You immediately know where you are and the world these people inhabit.
It's all presented in a glance so you can get your bearings and then explore it more intimately as time
passes, confident in the world he's created. A playwright could learn a lot from a set like that.
THE SUBMISSION  ** out of ****
MCC THEATER AT LUCILLE LORTEL
This comic drama by Jeff Tallbott begins with a strong premise and becomes decreasingly less interesting
as it goes along.
Jonathan Groff is Danny, a struggling playwright who thinks, who believes -- no, he knows  that he's just
had a creative breakthrough by writing a play about a black woman and her street-wise son who yearn to
break free of the project. Unfortunately, Danny is very white and very gay and believes no one will takehis play seriously or even think he has the "right" to tell such a story. So he comes up with the African-ish
sounding name of Shaleeha G'ntamobi to serve as a pseudonym and sends it out.
When the play is unexpectedly snapped up by a major festival and gets a full production, Danny
convinces struggling actress Emilie (Rutina Wesley) to serve as his front. She will be the face of the playuntil opening night when all will be revealed. It could blow up in their faces of course, but Emilie likesthe play so much she agrees (receiving 25% of any future royalties doesn't hurt either).
It's an amusing, intriguing premise rife with comic and dramatic possibilities that The Submission  mostly
squanders. How exactly did Danny get insight into that world, those characters? He doesn't really know,
he insists, and Groff is charming as he insists -- annoyingly -- that the play wrote itself after he was
inspired by an incident on the subway.
But it isn't long before racial issues boil to the surface in the back and forth between Danny and Emilie
(and his boyfriend played by Eddie Kaye Thomas and best pal played by Will Rogers). An early exchange
when Danny refers to a "Blony," as in a Tony won by a black actor raises some hackles for Emilie. Butsoon and for the rest of the play Danny is almost incapable of discussing his play or race in general
without immediately devolving into insulting phrases like "you people" or calling Emilie a servant or even
a slave.
Sometimes it is said intentionally with anger. But time and time again Danny proves utterly unaware of
his insensitive language that sounds more like a white Southerner in the 1960s than a young savvy gay

<p>man in New York City today. Do people reveal their biases unconsciously? Of course they do. But would
Danny do so in such a blunt and obvious way? He's supposed to be a playwright, a person skilled with
words and acutely aware of their impact. Danny is also apparently so empathetic and talented that he's
written a play about a black woman and her son so moving and real that everyone, literally everyone,
believes it to be a major work of art. So the idea that this particular man with this accomplishment could
be so clueless as to repeatedly say Archie Bunker-like phrases like "you people" is utterly unconvincing.Playwright Talbott needed to work a lot harder and with a lot more subtlety than he does here to makethis premise work. Some people in America surely consider ethnic food as daring and American cuisine
as "normal," but a young gay man working in the theater and living in NYC? It just doesn't ring true.
Even more absurd is when Danny complains that tokenism means black playwrights with inferior works
are mounted and praised while he can't get arrested with his shows. Really? A gay white man saying his
world isn't represented in the theater? You don't even have to bother listing all the gay-themed showsand talented gay playwrights with major, major success in the theater to realize how ludicrous this
sounds.
At the very least, Danny might have been straight and had a less risible argument. And of course he and
Emilie could then have found themselves attracted to each other, raising the stakes immediately. As for
ownership of a story, that could have been carried much further and more humorously if Emilie hadstarted rewriting or suggesting new business a lot more aggressively that the people mounting the showembraced while Danny was on the sidelines, powerless.
The most heated argument centers on a scene in the play Danny wrote that revolves around the copious
use of the "n" word. You know where the show is headed with this since Danny and Emilie fight more
bitterly at every stage. But when she tells him the world-class director helming his work and the famousproducer overseeing it all believe the use of the word dozens of times in that one scene is off-putting andshould be toned down, Danny reacts with righteous anger about how it's authentic and real and must
remain or the entire work is devalued. You keep waiting for it, but bizarrely Emilie -- who argues the
point vociferously -- never states the obvious: if the director and producer were talking to a gay white boyabout toning down the language in his play, Danny might be right to think there was a double standard.But they believe they're telling a smart and talented black woman whose play they love that the word
shouldn't be used so many times. So the context is radically different and therefore his argument is
hollow.
The finale is even less convincing with Danny perhaps finally realizing what a clueless schmuck he's been
(not to mention a boring date with dull tastes). I've barely mentioned Rogers and Thomas, both fineactors with very poorly defined characters that have almost nothing to do. The show could easily -- indeed
should -- be a two character drama to tighten the focus. Groff is always appealing on stage despite
Danny's inconsistency and he's not afraid to make Danny unlikable. The attractive Wesley handles thebest role with aplomb and intelligence, though she can't make Emilie's confused monologue aboutownership of a story turn into sense any more than the playwright did.
Walter Bobbie directs smoothly though he and the producers should have sent Talbott back to the
drawing board since his work has a great deal of unfulfilled promise and he clearly has the talent to
deliver it, if pushed further. The scenic design by David Zinn uses revolving panels to smoothly and
quickly change scenes from a coffee house to an apartment to a hotel room. It's a model of efficiency andmakes excellent use of the Lucille Lortel's small space.
