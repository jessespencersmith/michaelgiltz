3/24/2005 02:16:00 AMKafka came to Guantanamo Bay this year, once militaryproceedings started to review the cases of the prisoners beingheld and determine whether any of them should be released.Some lovely highlights: prisoners were refused the right tohear many of the charges against them or what evidence wasused to buttress those charges (it's classified; stop whining)and the lawyers and others prosecuting them covered up theirname-tags."So far, 64 detainees have had hearings scheduled beforeadministrative review boards, and 39 have declined to attend.Captain Kaniut said one reason was that many were skepticalabout the fairness of the proceedings. Another reason, he said,may be that the cases against them are so strong that ahearing would be futile," says the New York Times.And there are other reasons. Recent articles in the New YorkTimes and elsewhere described serious and upsetting chargesby court appointed lawyers. (If anything can be said to be"upsetting" that is less than the rape, torture and killing ofprisoners we KNOW have no useful information.) Among theclaims: guards at Guantanamo Bay pretend to be lawyers andmeet with prisoners to get info; then, when the real lawyersshow up, the prisoners don't trust them and refuse tocooperate in their own defense. Other prisoners meeting withlawyers have felt the wrath of guards after those lawyers leaveand then don't want to see the lawyers when they return.This is all making a sad mockery of what the United Statesstands for: fair trials, the rule of law, decency, respect and allthose other qualities in short supply at Guantanamo and thenumerous secret locations around the world we don't evenknow about. The sad truth is that some of the prisoners beingdetained actually are bad guys, but we don't need to treatthem like beasts or demean our principles even for them.And the rest -- people sold to the military by warlords to collecton bounty, innocent fools in the wrong place at the wrong time,and even the true believer combatants who signed up whenAfghanistan or Iraq was invaded by another country (hgoweverbenevolent) but don't have any knowledge of terrorism etc --god help us for how we've treated them and debased, morethan anyone else, ourselves.
