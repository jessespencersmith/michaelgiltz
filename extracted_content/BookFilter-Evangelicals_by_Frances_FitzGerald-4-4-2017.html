From the Publisher: “[A] capacious history of Evangelical American
Protestantism….A complex and fascinating epic.” — Booklist  (starred
review)  This groundbreaking book from Pulitzer Prize –winning historian
Frances FitzGerald is the first to tell the powerful, dramatic story of the
Evangelical movement in America—from the Puritan era to the 2016
presidential election. The evangelical movement began in the revivals ofthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, known in America as the GreatAwakenings. A populist rebellion against the established churches, it
became the dominant religious force in the country. During the nineteenth
century white evangelicals split apart dramatically, first North versusSouth, and then at the end of the century, modernist versusfundamentalist. After World War II, Billy Graham, the revivalist preacher,attracted enormous crowds…

What We Say
The media rediscovers conservative Christians every decade or so. In the 1970s, they reported with astonishment on Jimmy
Carter and "evangelicals," that time focusing on those from the left. Then they did it again in the 1980s with the rise oftelevangelists and politically active Christians on the right. Those evangelicals allied or perhaps took over the Republican
Party in the 1990s, an era when they reached a new peak of influence. Now, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Frances
FitzGerald takes the long view. In this accessible and detailed work, she tracks the rise and influence of EvangelicalAmerican Protestantism in all its complexity. FitzGerald charts the divisions and splinters, the in-fighting and the rapidShare This Book

<p>growth, the moments of doubt and scandal and the times of triumph. Those unfamiliar with this world may need a cheat
sheet to keep track of the distinction between pre-millenialists and dispensationalists, not to mention fundamentalists of
various hues. But several themes and patterns emerge. "Evangelical" is a tag for people of many different religious and
political beliefs, even if the Moral Majority and its ilk grabbed the megaphone and claimed to speak for all evangelicals andindeed all Christians for a number of years. Tension has always existed between those evangelicals who focus on socialjustice (improving life for people in the here and now) and those who focus on saving souls (the here-after). Even there, it'snot an easy liberal/conservative split. Evangelicals once pushed mightily for social causes like Prohibition, though later the
same conservative element disputed any need to fight climate change or poverty as worldly concerns. One can also learn of
altruism. When evangelicals were a persecuted minority, they strongly supported a separation between church and state;when they were ascendant and influencing policy in the 1980s and 1990s, far right evangelicals thought the idea of mergingchurch and state just fine and dandy. This work is peppered with vivid profiles of forgotten figures as well as battles overlong-forgotten areas of concern. FitzGerald details major thinkers in the movement all along, not to mention the business
acumen and political savvy of everyone from Ralph Reed to Rick Warren. It ends with the new visibility of progressive
evangelicals, offering a more nuanced picture of the people of faith that fall under this umbrella term. She is particularlystrong on analyzing recent events and putting them into historical context, showing how the Tea Party is essentially theconservative Christian wing of evangelicals branded under a new name. She is entertaining and eye-opening, fair and yet
willing to quietly make her case with a battery of facts. Evangelicals on the right may not like some of FitzGerald's
conclusions but they can't dispute the balance and scope of this history. -- Michael Giltz

engaging, and nuanced.” - Harvey G. Cox, Jr., Hollis Professor of Divinity Emeritus, Harvard Divinity School

Director of Princeton Universityâs Center for the Study of Religion
