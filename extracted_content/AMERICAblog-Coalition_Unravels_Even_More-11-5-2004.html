11/05/2004 02:35:00 AMThe coalition of the not-so-willing continues to fall apart, withHungary the latest country to say, "You're on your own!" to the U.S. Isuppose they were trying to be polite by not announcing this beforethe elections, but it would have been nice if they'd let the Americanpeople know BEFORE they voted that Hungary was voting with itsfeet on Iraq and getting the hell out. Out of 160,000 total coalitionforces, 138,000 are U.S."Other nations that have recently announced withdrawals include:Poland, with 2,350 troops; Italy, 3,000; the Netherlands, 1,300;Ukraine, 1,450, Norway, 300; New Zealand, 61; and Thailand, 880,"reports USA Today."Previously, Spain, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, thePhilippines, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan and El Salvador withdrewforces. New contributors to the force are South Korea and Tonga."I'd take pleasure in knowing Bush has to deal with this instead ofKerry, but our young men and women are dying in Iraq and wedesperately need MORE TROOPS. Bush insists the generals haven'tasked for any, but they know they're not supposed to or their careeris over so what a surprise that they don't. Meanwhile, any fool knowswe need more troops to defend those ammo depots, pretend todefend the leaky borders and start attacking the insurgents.
