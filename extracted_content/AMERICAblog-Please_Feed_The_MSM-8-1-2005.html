8/01/2005 03:35:00 PMA flurry of new Rove items have appeared, but it appears theMSM is waiting for the investigators to make the next move.Meanwhile, President Bush refuses to take the logical, commonsense step of placing national security ahead of friendship andcutting off Karl Rove and Scooter's access to classified info untilthey've been cleared. So what questions should the MSM beasking?1. How long does President Bush intend to let people who arecredibly charged with leaking classified information continuewith top secret clearance? Shouldn't the President suspend thatclearance until the investigation is complete? After all, we areat war.2. The President has always roundly condemned leakers in hisAdministration. He even announced a zero tolerance policy bystating anyone involved in leaking the identity of a cover CIAagent to the press would be fired. Now the President has goneback on his word. Is the new Bush standard that only someoneactually convicted of a crime will be fired? Doesn't that makeBush's standard the weakest in history?3. How does the President feel about having not one, not two,not three, but possibly four people high up in his adminstrationwho have leaked classified information to the press?4.How does the President justify a recess appointment of amajor official who knowingly lied to Congress? How many othertimes has John Bolton been involved in an investigation into abreach of national security? Does it happen every week?Assuming this was the first time, doesn't it boggle the mindthat he could forget something as important as that? Scotty,you've been interviewed as part of an investigation intonational security -- how many times has that happened to you?Do you think you'll ever forget that? Doesn't that indicate thatJohn Bolton either lied to Congress or simply doesn't careabout national security? Does John Bolton intend to apologizeto Congress for lying to them? Or does he not think lying toCongress is a serious matter? Does the President think lying toCongress is not a serious matter?4. Is the President angry that his adminsminstration is the firstin history to intentionally out a covert CIA agent for partisanpolitical purposes? If he is angry, why dooesn't he dosomething about it? He doesn't need to wait for the end of aninvestigation to act on the facts available to him right now. Ifhe doesn't act, can we assume the President could care less?What questions would you ask?
