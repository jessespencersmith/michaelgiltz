True enough, butusually it's been a casual comment by one of the principals (eg. Fordtells some reporter he'd be glad to make another one) getting conflatedinto "news" -- "FORD SAYS NEW INDY FLICK IS A GO!" This is thefirst time to my knowledge that all three principals -- Lucas, Ford andSpielberg -- have said they're happy with the script and the film isgoing to happen. This is the first time Spielberg has said it will be hisnext directorial effort. They've even staked a release date of May 2008.It's gonna happen. The Hollywood Reporter says so. Variety says so.And most importantly George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and HarrisonFord have all signed off on the script and are ready to go. A couple ofpoints: Variety says this marks a return to pure entertainment afterbeing interested in more serious fare like "Schindler's List," "SavingPrivate Ryan" and "Munich." That of course ignores "The Lost World:Jurassic Park," which he made after "Schindler," not to mention "WarOf The Worlds" (grim but still pure popcorn), "Catch Me If You Can" (adelightful adult comic-drama, and even arguably "The Terminal" (notsuccessful but hardly hard-hitting social drama) and "MinorityReport," grim again but still pretty darn popcorn-ish. And finally, giventhe 20 years that will have passed since the last Indy film, this one willimmediately become the most successful of the four by far -- the boxoffice is infinitely bigger now for a movie like this. $500 millionworldwide would be the low-end of expectations, I'd say given the$800 million+ for Potter and LOTR, etc. And $500 million worldwidewould be more than any of the first three.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
