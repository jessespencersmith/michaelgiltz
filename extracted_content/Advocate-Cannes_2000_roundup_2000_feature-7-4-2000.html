C'est la Cannes 
CANNES HAS NEVER BEE the gayest film fes­
tinu (the scene on the Croisette is more about starlets 
than Speedos). But gay linages did flicker on the screen 
tltis year. and tlley weren't always pretty. 
TIle festival-a nd the complamts-ki cked offwitll the 
costlU1le drama \ ·alel. featllling Gerard Depardieu and 
L'ma 111llnl1Lm. Depardieu stars as a chef charged witll 
prl'paring for a \isit by King Louis A1V. tlle rum featlu-es a 
subplot about Louis's brotller, known as "Monsieur ," who 
fancies a ce11am houseboy. (He doesn't get hml.) Clities 
clied homophobia but director Roland Jotfe cried, ":'vloi?" 
"For anybody to detect homophobia in the film," 
Joffe told Tile Arl roca Ie. "they would have to have it 
in them. Monsieur is treated with immense sympa­
thy." That might be stretching it, but this gay charac­
ter is no nastier than his straight cOlmterpaIts-and 
he does manage a good deed or two. 
yleanwhi le, in another century, a band of rugged 
sanlurai get hot and bothered by a beautiful new male 
recruit in Cohatto, the new film from Japanese mas­
ter Nagisa OshiI1la Returning to the globalliInelight 
after a 14-year absence and recovering from a stroke, 
OshiIna scored a commercial hit in his own country 
while contmumg his longtime tradition of breaking 
sexual taboos on-screen. (His 1976 In the Realm of 
Ihe Senses is still an erotic landmark. ) 
"It wasn't lllltil I made Cohatto that I realized [sexual] 
taboos have not been fully demolished ," OshiIna told the 
press at Carmes, where tlle film stirred a flurry of con­
troversy. "This is an iInPOltant problem m Japan." 
Festival kudos also went to the Blitish 
gotta-dance ciraIna Dancer, about a boy who KIRK AND DEWOLF: BRIDGET BESAW·GDRMAN 
From left: Laura Kirk and Nat DeWolf want to get 
Famous; Uma Thurman contemplates her corset in the 
French costumer Va tel. 
rejects boxmg for ballet despite fanUlial pressure. 
Featuring stirring dance routines and a straight hero's 
nonjudgmental friendship with a gay classmate, this 
film promises to be a sleeper hit when Universal 
opens it m the United States in the fall. 
Modem gay iInagery got aI11usmgly spoofed m Fa­
mous, a U.S. mockun1entary directed by GIiffin Durme 
about two young actors chasmg stardom. The two are 
played by cowriters Nat DeWolf and Laura Kirk. 
DeWolf is Tate, who's preparing a one-man off­
Broadway show, Hate Crirnes and Broken Hearts. Nat­
urally, as in all gay one-man shows, it mvolves hiIn snip­
pmg down to his underwear. 
"It's unbelievable how strange this week has been," 
says DeWolf, who found out orily a few weeks before­
hand that Famo'us was commg to the festival. 
Getting ready to face tlle media at Carmes, DeWolf 
told tlle producers to make it clear that he's openly gay. 
But despite tlle crush of reporters and endless round­
table discussions , "no one has asked me.so far," he says, 
laugl1ing. "1 think people have a responsibility to be out. 
I don't know. I could be making a huge mistake. But I 
can't [be m the closet], it would just be too much work." 
Master Japanese 
filmmaker Nagisa 
Oshima returned 
to Cannes after 
a long absence 
with the sexy and 
controversial 
samurai drama 
Gohatto.
