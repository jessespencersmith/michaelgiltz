3/23/2005 03:16:00 PMThe schism in the Episcopal Church grew wider today. GayUK.com reports that the Scottish Episcopal Church said today itsaw nothing wrong in ordaining actively gay priests andadmitted it had blessed gay unions. This is what is known asdoing God's work, so naturally they will be attacked on all sidesfor showing love and compassion for gay people who want toserve God and commit to faithful, loving, monogamousrelationships.Compounding their idiocy and hatred: a bishop in teh starving,beleagured country of Uganda is reported in the same article tohave refused a donation of about $300,000 to fight AIDS fromthe US diocese of Central Pennsylvania because it has links tothe recently ordained gay bishop Gene Robinson. Yes, betterhis people should die from lack of medical care than acceptmoney from people who don't hate gay people as vehementlyas he does.
