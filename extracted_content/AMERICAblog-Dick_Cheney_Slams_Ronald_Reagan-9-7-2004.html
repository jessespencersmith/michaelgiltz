9/07/2004 06:49:00 PMYep, Dick Cheney is willing to smear even Republican icon RonaldReagan as "soft on terrorism" if it means winning an election. MaybeReagan was too busy freeing Eastern Europe from the clutches ofcommunism, Dick. Somebody, quick, get a comment from NancyReagan about this slap on her just-buried husband.Maybe Cheney is just bitter because -- unlike him -- Reagan served inthe military and applied for active duty. Reagan took several physicalsto try and qualify (his eyesight was terrible) and finally had to accepthe wouldn't be allowed to serve overseas in battle but went where hewas told and served honorably.
