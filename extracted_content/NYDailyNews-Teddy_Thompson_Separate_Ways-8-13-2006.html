ritical acclaim didn't do it. A famous mother 
and father (Richard and Linda Thompson) 
didn't do it. A major record label and big-time 
producer didn't do it. Constant touring didn't do 
it. But maybe, just maybe, it will be the movies 
that finally bring the talented musician Teddy 
Thompson into the spotlight. 
Thompson is featured on "Rogue's Gal­
lery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs & Chan­
teys," an all-star two-CD compilation out 
Aug 22 and tied in to the biggest movie of 
the year, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead 
Man's Chest." 
Also out is the soundtrack to the docu­
mentary/concert film "Leonard Cohen: I'm 
Your Man," a movie that enjoyed critical 
raves and an extended run at Film Forum. 
(Despite an all-star lineup that includes 
members of U2 and Pulp, Nick Cave and 
Thompson's pal Rufus Wainwright, among 
others, the one perfonnance that stands 
out is Thompson's crystal-clear rendition 
of Cohen's ''Tonight Will Be Fine.") 
Hopefully, fans discovering Thomp-
son on these sound tracks and tie-ins will 
also pick up his second album, "Separate 
Ways" (Verve Forecast). Given an "p,:' by 
Entertainment Weekly, praised by USA To­
day for offering "supple, evocative melo­
dies" and "tunes that sparkle and linger," 
it's a triumph for Thompson, who was 
dumped by VIrgin Records practically the 
day his debut CD hit stores six years ago. 
He took his time after that setback, record­
ed songs at his own pace and on his own 
dime and approached labels only when he 
had an album that was done to his satis­
faction. 
"I did feel dispirited," admits Thomp­
son, whose natural pessimistic reaction to 
good news is to wait for the bad news that 
surely must follow. "I didn't have a par· 
ticularly good experience with VIrgin 
Records. And nobody likes to be told 
they're not wanted." 
Born in the U.K., Thompson still 
feels British at heart, even though 
he moved to Los Angeles at 18 and 
has been a longtime New Yorker 
(he often perfonns at the down­
town space the Living Room). 
"I've always wanted to live in New 
York," says Tliompson. "I only went 
to L.A. because 1 knew some people 
there and my dad was living there. 
When 1 was 18,1 would have 
gone straight here, but 1 didn't 
think I was capable of making it. 
New Yorkers almost don't know 
what New York means to people 
that move here. It's a mythical, 
amazing place." 
The son of legendary folk-
rock singers Richard and Linda 
Thompson, Thompson is cur­
rently touring all over the world, 
perfonning songs like the plain­
tive "Sorrvto See Me Go" and 
the droll atbum opener "Shine So 
Bright," in which Thompsonjok­
ingly longs for overwhelming fame_ For months, that fame has been com­
ing closer. He has been jumping from the 
U.S. to the UK and Canada and then 
back again, performing to larger and larg­
er crowds every time. His album "Sepa­
rate Ways" has garnered much more in­
tense media attention overseas. British 
critics have garlanded the album with rave 
four-star reviews and compared his inti­
mate songwriting with Jackson Browne, 
though Thompson himself feels much 
closer to the pop craft of Crowded House 
and Cohen. 
Like Cohen, Thompson has a w.ry 
sense of humor that sometimes gets con­
fused for melancholy or boastfulness . 
"Some people think I'm arrogant or 
don't care, but it's usually me trying to be 
funny," says the handsome singer-song­
writer, who turns 30 this year "Some peo­
ple just don't see the humor in some of the 
songs. You can't expect everybody to 
get everything . But it's been good 
for me to be in England. 
I feel my sense of hu­
mor is a bit more 
understood right 
off the bat.".</p>
