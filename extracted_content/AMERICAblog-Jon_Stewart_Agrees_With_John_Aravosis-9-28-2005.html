9/28/2005 12:47:00 AMJon Stewart covered the weekend anti-war protest in DC.Stewart could have mocked the MSM's coverage of 100,000+people marching on Washington -- most press photos I sawbarely hinted at the size of the protest, stories were burieddeep inside newspapers, and many also included sizablereferences to the counter-protest by war supporters withoutmaking clear theirs was pathetically small in comparison(hundreds of people as opposed to hundreds of thousands).Did Stewart do any of this? Nope, he made the same pointJohn in DC did -- that poorly organized protests with peoplewandering around the podium and with speakers raising everyunrelated issue under the sun make us look stupid.Stewart: On Saturday, a 100,000 strong peace marchdescended on Washington seeking to crystallize America'sdissatisfaction with the war into one single idea.Clip of young male speaker: Peace!Stewart: Okay.Clip of male speaker: Justice!Stewart: (pause) Fine.Clip of male speaker: Environmental protection!Stewart: (pause, confused look on face)Clip of male speaker: No racism!Stewart: (dumb-founded, and then says in Valley Girl-likevoice) Dude! I didn't hike from Oberlin for this.Stewart then mocked the organizers for following Cindy Sheehan'sspeech with a poet and then said, "All in all, a rather disorganizedprotest that no doubt cheered conservatives."Happily, Stewart DID mock the absurdly small counter-protest,something the MSM failed to do properly. But when Jon Stewartbelieves -- just like John in DC -- that throwing in every issue underthe sun at an anti-war protest is stupid, people should listen.
