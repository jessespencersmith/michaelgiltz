4/30/2005 07:47:00 PMI've been angry and sick for months now about the widespreadrape, sodomy, torture and killing of prisoners done in our nameby US troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and inundisclosed locations we don't even know about. Except forlow-level grunts caught on tape and one top figure (who saysnot without justification that she's the scapegoat), no one incommand is being punished. Many in command have beengiven the Medal of Freedom, promotions and other awards.Many Americans have shrugged and said it's a war on terrorand you have to fight hard. Well, you lose when you debaseand abandon the principals that made this country great. Youlose when our government can grab American citizens onAmerican soil, throw them in a hole and insist that it neverneeds to answer to anyone ever about what we've done. TheseOrwellian tactics SHOULD cause an ongoing outcry.But Bush, to his eternal shame, has made rape, torture andkilling in the name of freedom commonplace, dull and in aquiet way even accepted.It's very clear we now regularly send prisoners to countries weKNOW will torture and kill them to obtain information ofdubious value. This washing of our hands is worthy of Pilateand hopefully Bush will be remembered equally with disdain.The latest charming ally that we send prisoners to?Uzbekistan. The New York Times reports:Now there is growing evidence that the United Stateshas sent terror suspects to Uzbekistan for detentionand interrogation, even as Uzbekistan's treatment ofits own prisoners continues to earn it admonishmentsfrom around the world, including from the StateDepartment.The so-called rendition program, under which theCentral Intelligence Agency transfers terrorismsuspects to foreign countries to be held andinterrogated, has linked the United States to othercountries with poor human rights records. But theturnabout in relations with Uzbekistan is particularlysharp. Before Sept. 11, 2001, there was littlehigh-level contact between Washington and Tashkent,the Uzbek capital, beyond the United States' criticism.Uzbekistan's role as a surrogate jailer for the UnitedStates was confirmed by a half-dozen current andformer intelligence officials working in Europe, theMiddle East and the United States. The C.I.A. declinedto comment on the prisoner transfer program, but anintelligence official estimated that the number ofterrorism suspects sent by the United States toTashkent was in the dozens.A pre-9-11 report by the State Departmen on Uzbekistan said:
