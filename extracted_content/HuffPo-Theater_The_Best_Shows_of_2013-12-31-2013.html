MORE:Theater:  The  Best  Shows  of  2013
Here's a look back at my favorite shows of the year. The truly frustrating, wonderful
thing about theater is how ephemeral it is. Performances are slightly different everynight depending on the actors, the audience, the weather and a million other
factors. Of course, when the cast changes, the show changes even more. So already
shows like Matilda  and soon After  Midnight  are very different (better, worse, just as
good but in different ways) as the shows I saw and reviewed. And despite seeingthree shows a week, I've still managed to miss some of the most acclaimed shows ofthe year. Maybe it was the title -- it sounds like an Off Broadway revue designed tobe commercial -- but I never saw Bad  Jews , only to have a friend see it on closing
night and tell me I'd missed the best play of the year. Argh!
So of the shows I actually saw, here are my favorites. And thanks again to the actors
and writers and directors and artisans and stage hands who make it happen, even
on shows I didn't like. No one gets into the theater to become rich. A bad movie can
be annoying; a bad play should make you empathize with the actors who must goonstage every night and try and kick some life into a dead mule. I try to reflect thatin reviews that never avoid calling a flop a flop but always try to pan for gold andcelebrate a particular performance or element of even the worst show that offers aglimmer of talent.

12 Red Flags That Could Spell Doom

12.  The  Rime  Of  The  Ancient  Mariner  at BAM
13.  Isaac's  Eye/Year  Of  The  Rooster
1.  and  2.  JULIUS  CAESAR   AT  ST.  ANN'S  WAREHOUSE /TWELTH  NIGHT
-- The trappings for this Julius  Caesar  are boldly innovative: an all-female cast! An
immersive experience with armed guards taking you to your seat! A setting of a
prison! But all of that melted away and what I remember most is a Shakespeare playI've never been terribly fond of brought to vivid, brilliant life led by a brilliant cast.Not a brilliant cast of women -- though that they were -- but a brilliant cast ofactors. I couldn't imagine anyone male or female better in these roles than Frances
Barber, Harriet Walter, Cush Jumbo and the rest. A triumph for director Phyllida
Lloyd and her entire team.
In contrast, the London Globe Theatre's production of Twelfth  Night  was thoroughly
traditional. The staging was done as in Shakespeare's time, the actors donned their
makeup and costume in sight of the audience and it was an all-male cast. But justlike Julius  Caesar , the casting was not a stunt but an approach to the work that
drew out riches and insight into the play that no other casting would do. This troupe
also performed a solid Richard  III  in repertory and it was a treat to see actors in
dramatically different roles from one night to the next. But Twelfth  Night  was the
highlight, with even the movement of an actor from one part of the stage to another
handled in hilarious fashion. (The women glide across the stage as if on a movingsidewalk with their feet hidden under voluminous dresses; the effect is invariablystriking and amusing, while the speed at which they move reveals the character'sstate of mind -- it's not just a gimmick.) At the heart of it was Mark Rylance, one ofthe great stage actors of this or any time. He's smart enough to surround himselfwith the best so this show had many pleasures, including the unexpected delight ofseeing Stephen Fry on stage (!) and Samuel Barnett in two delicious turns as
women. He's a handsome man and a fetching woman and one would hate to choose
-- luckily, with live theater we can have him either way.
3. PARSIFAL   AT  THE  MET  -- My first experience of Wagner's gorgeous
masterwork was overwhelming in its beauty. A religious experience indeed,
overseen by director Francois Giraud and sung by an impeccable cast includingRene Papa, Peter Mattei and Jonas Kaufmann as Parsifal.
4. AUGUST  WILSON'S  AMERICAN  CENTURY  CYCLE  -- One of the
theatrical triumphs of the year didn't take place on Broadway. It happened at a
radio station. The Greene Space is a performance venue shared by WNYC andWQXR. They partnered with the August Wilson estate to stage readings of all tenplays in Wilson's epic look at the 20th century, with one play for every decade.They'll be edited and aired on public radio in 2014 and the audio recordings will bemade available in various ways through libraries, academic institutions and the like(though one has to hope a commercial release of all ten will also happen).Overseeing this endeavor was playwright, actor and director Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who brought together a dream team of veterans of Wilson's plays toperform them for posterity. I attended three of the readings -- Jitney  (which is the
only Wilson play yet to debut on Broadway, a fact Santiago-Hudson is determined to
change), Ma  Rainey's  Black  Bottom  and Gem  Of  The  Ocean.  Each had their
pleasures and each made me eager to see them again in fully staged productions.
Since I hadn't seen the latter two (I've seen the other eight in the cycle at leastonce), this event offered me exactly what it intended -- a chance to experienceWilson's great words performed by great casts. They stand on their own but they'realso invaluable for those who have yet to see them on stage. Since Wilson was thesecond most produced playwright in America last year (after Shakespeare), clearly
most everyone has the chance to see at least some of his plays. That will surely make
them all the more hungry to read and hear the rest. And then they'll discover thisresource, this archive, this work of art.
5. VANYA  AND  SONYA  AND  MASHA  AND  SPIKE  -- I missed its first
incarnation at Lincoln Center, so while many critics had this on their list last year, I
caught up with it on Broadway. It's Christopher Durang's warmest, most humancomedy and the funniest show of the year. The entire play is perfectly cast and it'sgreat to see stars like David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver make room forKristine Nielsen's remarkable turn in the role of a lifetime. I look forward to the
revivals sure to come.
6.PASSION  -- The revival of Stephen Sondheim's Passion  was the highlight of
Classic Stage Company's season. It wasn't a revelation for me -- I loved the show

Crowd Ignite »when it debuted on Broadway -- but the excellent cast and staging combined with
the gift of CSC's intimate space to make this a truly memorable evening of theater.Judy Kuhn and Melissa Errico were triumphant and Ryan Silverman (new to me)
was their match as Giorgio. Over the years, I've been heartbroken that a number of
shows that premiered at CSC didn't transfer and get a longer life, if only for theselfish reason that I wanted to see them again. Here's one more to add to my list.
7. MATILDA  THE  MUSICAL  -- It came from London wrapped in hype and lived
up to expectations. This, for me, is the family show of the moment, with a wickedly
black sense of humor, great and eye-catching production design and solid songs thatoffer plenty of opportunity for witty and engaging performances. They improved on
Roald Dahl's novel in ways both large and small, adding some emotional depth
without sacrificing his rather nasty worldview and it's all perfectly wonderful forkids and their parents. The score isn't great enough to send me into heaven, but it'ssolid and funny. I'll be remembering and laughing and shivering just a bit overBertie Carvell's brilliant embodiment of Miss Trunchbull for the rest of my life.
8. THE  WEIR   AT  THE  IRISH  REP  -- I seem to be alone in finding Conor
McPherson's new play The  Night  Alive  underwhelming. It's sure to be on many
other Best of the Year lists. But I am a big fan of his work in general and this
impeccable revival of The  Weir  is a case in point. I loved it when I saw the show well
into its run on the West End. Here it was even better and an excellent way to
celebrate the Irish Rep's 25th anniversary. I'm only astonished it isn't still running,though Off Broadway is such a puzzle for commercial producers I suppose Ishouldn't be surprised this didn't transfer.
9. THE  NEW  YORK  MUSICAL  THEATRE  FESTIVAL  -- This annual
celebration of new musicals wisely moved to the summer where it could get more
attention. NYMF  is an institution now and 2013 was a banner year in terms of
quality. Bend  In  The  Road  was a Broadway worthy production of Anne  Of  Green
Gables,  with Alison Woods a delight in the central role. Volleygirls  was a seriously
commercial and fun look at high school volleyball bursting with talent in its largelyfemale cast. (I suppose the flops Lysistrata  Jones  and Bring  It  On!  scared investors
off sports musicals but they missed a winner here.) Other shows almost as goodincluded another high school set story Crossing  Swords,  a look at the making of a
Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers movie named Castle  Walk  and Onalea Gilbertson in
another terrific turn in Mata  Hari  in  8  Bullets.  Can't wait for 2014.
10. SAVION  GLOVER'S  STePz  -- Every year, dancer, director and choreographer
Savion Glover has a three week residency at the Joyce and offers up a new show.STePz  is the latest and one of the best from this enduring talent. He did everything
imaginable with steps and stairs, aided by an excellent cast including above all themarvelous Marshall Davis Jr. From the opener set to John Contrane's "Miles' Mode"to the penultimate triumph of a haunting "Mr. Bojangles" sung by Sammy Davis Jr.,it was an evening of pure delight.
11. A  GENTLEMAN'S  GUIDE  TO  LOVE  AND  MURDER  -- Like Catch  Me  If
You  Can  a few seasons ago, this is a great production of a merely good musical. But
it out-Droods The  Mystery  Of  Edwin  Drood  in its music hall silliness, the set design
is brilliant, the cast strong and Jefferson Mays a wonder in playing virtually half of
the characters in the show. It's a show-stopper of a turn and more than that becauseMays never hijacks the show to show off; he creates individual characters and bringsthem to life. If no one told you what he was doing, you might not even notice untilhalf way through the night. (My god, isn't that the same actor??!!) Great fun.
12. THE  RIME  OF  THE  ANCIENT  MARINER  AT  BAM  -- Just as the year
came to an end, actress Fiona Shaw, dancer-actor Daniel Hay-Gordon and director
Phyllida Lloyd (yes, the same talent behind Julius  Caesar ) delivered theater at its
most elemental and powerful. Their performance of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's RimeOf  The  Ancient  Mariner  at the Brooklyn Academy Of Music used subtle, centuries-
old craft to tell the story of a sailor haunted by the killing of an albatross anddoomed to tell his tale of woe to passers-by seemingly for all eternity. Shaw andHay-Gordon did a delightful dance, with Shaw voicing all the parts and the twoseamlessly trading off the physical parts with clarity and grace. One moment Shaw isplaying the Wedding Guest and the next the Mariner, one moment Hay-Gordon isthe Guest and the next he's a sailor or the albatross and they never miss a beat.Impeccably done and hopefully the latest in what will continue to be an exploration
by Shaw and Lloyd of great poetry on stage.

<p>Studio Theatre for me. This small house nurtures new playwrights with care and
passion. They introduced me to the distinctive voices of Lucas Hnath and Eric
Dufault, two talents I'll be following for years to come. (Indeed, Hnath alreadydelivered a fascinating piece on Walt Disney, confirming his promise.) Good writingattracts good actors so I also had the pleasure of watching Bobby Moreno strutaround the stage like the cock of the walk as he embodied the confused, angry,preening rooster Odysseus.
OTHER  MEMORABLE  MOMENTS
GILBERTO  SANTA  ROSA  IN  FOREVER  TANGO  -- I came for the tango and
stayed for the salsa. Santa Rosa -- the Gentleman Of Salsa -- came onto the stage of
this revival of the dance show to a wave of applause from the knowingLatino/Hispanic audience and you immediately understood why. He was a magneticpresence, a brilliant singer and an effortless showman. Forever  Santa  Rosa  -- now
that's a show I'd go see again and again.
NATHAN  LANE  IN  THE  NANCE  -- Douglas Carter Beane's play about a closeted
gay man playing effeminate gay characters in vaudeville -- the "nance" of the title --
was an ambitious work that didn't quite hit a home run for me. But Nathan Lanewas a marvel. He literally did it all: singing and dancing, comic routines,vaudevillian energy, comedy, drama, pathos. If he burst into a high c at some point,I might have missed it but I wouldn't be surprised. Lane's ability to make lightningfast switches between old school shtick and dramatic intensity was a gift to the showand the audience. They don't make 'em like that anymore, except sometimes theydo, thank goodness.
NELLIE  MCKAY  IN  OLD  HATS  -- I'm eager to see Bill Irwin and David Shiner
any time they want to clown around. Their evening of vaudeville and silent comic
gems was great fun indeed. But the icing on the cake was the presence of theabsurdly gifted Nellie McKay as the musical guest. She didn't just lead a band interrific renditions of her songs. McKay also interacted with Irwin and Shiner as theycompete for her attention, lasering in on the retro vibe of the show but alwaysmaintaining a key intelligence as well. She strolled the aisles during intermission,playing the ukelele and delivering weird facts, like whose birthday it was that day orexclaiming apropos of nothing that we should be kind to our waitress. "Try the tofu!"she burbled. What a delight. No wonder those two men fight for her affection.
CHRISTINE  GOERKE  IN  THE  WOMAN  WITHOUT  A  SHADOW   AT  THE
MET  -- I was mixed on this production of Strauss's opera. But no one could deny it
was a thrilling night of theater to see Christine Goerke's triumphant return to the
Met after years of vocal issues and proceed to tear it up as the Dyer's Wife. Any foolcould see she would be a great Brunnhilde and literally as I posted my review theMetropolitan Opera announced Goerke would be doing exactly that when the RingCycle returned in 2018.
AARON  COSTA  GANIS  -- The play The  Mnemonist  Of  Dutchess  County  didn't
come close to working for me. But Ganis played a carnival barker of a guy who
hosted stage performances by a man with a freakish memory. His energy and
audience improv woke the play up (briefly) and made me laugh. I've been saying,"The Mnemonist! Of Dutchess County!" ever since and that has to count forsomething.
DEBORAH  COX  IN  JEKYLL  &  HYDE  -- Who knew pop star Deborah Cox
would be such a winning stage presence? Get her a good show right away, Broadway
producers! (And god willing some day Constantine Maroulis will get a good show,
too.)
ROGER  REES  IN  THE  WINSLOW  BOY  -- Seeing Roger Rees age before our
eyes in this strong revival of The  Winslow  Boy  by Roundabout was one of the
highlights of the year and a timely reminder of his talents on stage. Rees has become
so adept as a director with the success of Peter  and  the  Starcatcher  that we might
have forgotten what a terrific actor he is as well. No one seeing this chestnut broughtvividly to life will forget about Rees the actor ever again.
FANTASIA  IN  AFTER  MIDNIGHT  -- I'd love to return to this re-imagining of a
night at the Cotton Club when kd lang is the guest singer. But boy am I glad I caught
Fantasia. She looked great. She sounded great. And she sang some classic tunes withthe aplomb of a star and the insight of a world-weary soul. Sometimes people liketheir divas tragic but here's hoping Fantasia continues to give her fans a happyending.</p>
<p>HAMISH  MCCANN  IN  LA  SOIREE  -- I'm not a natural fan of burlesque (too
uptight!) but I was won over by the entire cast of this sexy, silly edition. Hamish
McCann is in the duo The English Gents with Denis Lock. But it was his solo spotclimbing up a rope while holding his body parallel to the ground that stopped theshow for me -- McCann was physically impressive, gymnastically precise andwinningly charming to boot. As a bonus, I spent the show captivated by thebeguiling person across the way from me who seemed to be enjoying the antics inexactly the same manner as myself. Theater in the round can be tricky, but it doesallow you to check out audience members just as easily as you check out the talenton stage.
