11/04/2004 01:36:00 PMTwo signal events bookend this year and they are inextricably linked.Early in 2004, Mel Gibson's "The Passion Of The Christ" was anastonishing blockbuster throughout the country. It's one of thetop-grossing movies of the year and it's in Aramaic for gosh sakes.The pundits on the coasts were astonished but people in theheartland lined up to see it again and again. (It made more thanthree times as much as "Fahrenheit 9-11" at the box office.)And now George Bush is president. 56% of Catholics voted for Bushover the first Catholic nominee since John F. Kennedy! As a practicingCatholic who was furious with the Bishops that stumped for Bush,that breaks my heart. Right there, in that one group, you've got amargin for victory for Bush. (You can blame any group, really, sincethe race was tight enough to hinge on one state.)Voters weren't most concerned with Iraq or terrorism or even theeconomy. They voted on moral issues. Pundits on both coasts wereagain astonished. Our young men and women are dying overseas andpeople at home are more worried about gay marriage."Democrats were left with the fact that in the past 28 years, onlyJimmy Carter and Bill Clinton among their ranks have made it, andboth had Southern and evangelical support. Mr. Kerry, a lifelongRoman Catholic, often struggled this year to speak of his faith inpublic," says the New York Times.""Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter got elected because they werecomfortable with their faith," said Representative Rahm Emanuel ofIllinois, a former Clinton aide. "What happened was that a part of theelectorate came open to what Clinton and Carter had to say oneverything else - health care, the environment, whatever - becausethey were very comfortable that Clinton and Carter did not disdainthe way these people lived their lives, but respected them.""He added: "We need a nominee and a party that is comfortable withfaith and values. And if we have one, then all the hard work we'vedone on Social Security or America's place in the world or collegeeducation can be heard. But people aren't going to hear what we sayuntil they know that we don't approach them as Margaret Mead wouldan anthropological experiment.""It's the year of the Christ. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.
