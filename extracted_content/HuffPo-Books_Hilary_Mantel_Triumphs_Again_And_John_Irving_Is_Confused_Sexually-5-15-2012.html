Henry Holt
Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall was the literary event of 2009, winning the Man Booker prize, breaking onto
the bestseller list and ultimately becoming inescapable. Simply everyone read it and loved it. Mantel'saccomplishment was multifold: she brought history to life, turned the very familiar event of Henry VIIIdumping his wife for Anne Boleyn into a nail-biting political thriller and upended our image of ThomasCromwell from a villain who persecuted the saintly Thomas More into the most modern and likable ofmen.
She does it all again with Bring Up The Bodies,  the second of what Mantel now promises will be a trilogy
of tales about Cromwell. (The third book will be called The Mirror And The Light  and it can't come soon
enough.) It is just as good as Wolf Hall  and if I couldn't help myself and started casting the movie (surely
Gary Oldman and the team behind Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy  would be marvelous with this intrigue?)
don't think this is a film or play waiting to happen. (Though it would be a fine riposte to the musty A
Man For All Seasons .) It is a novel both literary and page-turning and confirms her status as a writer ofMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

The sheer audaciousness of what Henry VIII demanded in Wolf Hall  came across thrillingly. Even the
most casual fan of history knows Henry dumped one wife after another in search of an heir and blithely
risked war and a schism with Rome by creating his own church just so he could get a divorce. Cromwell
made it happen despite the overwhelming odds against it. Even the king of England is not so free and
omnipotent as he'd like to believe but it happened and Henry was wedded to Anne Boleyn.
Now -- brazenly -- he wants to do it again. Anne has produced no male heir but many enemies with her
sharp tongue and undiplomatic ways. Henry's eye is caught by the demure Jane Seymour and her familywisely keeps her within sight but out of reach of the monarch. Can't a king have what he wants? Henry
wants Jane. Cromwell moved heaven and earth and prevented a military catastrophe in holding England
together and placing Anne on the throne. Can he do it again? And if he's successful will Henry hate himfor it, deciding that Cromwell was the mover and shaker that "pushed" him towards Anne in the firstplace?
The entire novel takes place over nine months but it lasers in on the few sharp, dangerous weeks when
Cromwell must act. The pure pleasure Mantel provides is the joy of being inside the mind of the smartest
person in the room. Cromwell is prone to flattery and revenge as much as anyone. But seeing him spar
with courtiers, parry with diplomats, bow to royalty without ever debasing himself and always, always
striving to both give the king what he wants and anticipate how quickly such desire can change isgenuinely exciting.
Cromwell is above all a practical  man, something the nobility despise in him but a character trait that the
common born Cromwell learns to prize above all else. Watching him out-think, out-maneuver and out-
wit them all is deeply satisfying. After pulling off this literary feat twice, you realize the smartest person inthe room isn't Cromwell after all -- it's Mantel.
IN ONE PERSON BY JOHN IRVING  ** out of ****
$28; 425 pagesSimon & Schuster
What is a bisexual? A bisexual is a person who can have an emotionally and physically satisfying
relationship with someone of either gender. It's not strictly about sex. Anyone can have sex with anyoneor anything and that merely makes them indiscriminate or horny or bored or adventurous or -- if they'rea frat boy -- "really really drunk" and determined to pretend they don't remember a thing the next day.Sex is not the same thing as love.
Author John Irving ( profiled here by Time magazine ) knows this intellectually and having a bisexual at
the center of his latest novel is not a big deal. As he points out, Irving has always embraced sexual
suspects, as he calls them. The wikipedia entry for Irving  even amusingly details recurring topics in his
books (like Vienna and bears, for example) and you can see sex and violence in all their permutationsMOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2

<p>appear again and again: homosexuality, lesbianism, incest, pedophilia, sex workers, transexuals,
adultery, swinging (as they called it in the Seventies), rape, gang rape, self-mutilation, May-Decemberromance and on and on.
But emotionally, as a writer, I don't think Irving quite "gets" bisexuality, despite his public avowal of
schoolboy crushes on other guys. I think that explains the emotional flatness and odd repetitiveness of
this book.
The story is eccentric and filled with memorable characters, like all of Irving's books. Billy is our bisexual
hero, which can't have been easy at an all boy's boarding school in the early 1960s. Still, for all theinsistence of how hard this was, Billy sure had about as welcoming and accepting an environment as onecould hope for outside of a gay commune. His step-father is very open to sexual variety (something Billy
appreciates once he gets over an awkward crush on the man), his grandfather is so good at playing
female roles in the local community theater that it's clear to everyone grandpa ain't just acting and thelocal librarian is a woman of deep understanding and empathy who always provides the perfect book atthe perfect time for Billy's education. He also enjoys a transgender role model (which will become a life-long attraction for him) and ultimately even more positive gay role models.
Billy can "pass" so he doesn't even endure taunting from fellow students except for one guy on the
wrestling team that is merciless. But then everyone wants to sleep with that guy anyway and he's soooo
merciless that it doesn't take much thought to realize there's more going on here than bullying.
The novel stretches from childhood to the age of AIDS but it returns again and again to the small town
where Billy was formed emotionally. The plot twists are hard to swallow. Billy and another student both
suffer from severe speech defects that banally signal their aversion to this or that sexual possibility.Difficulty in saying "vagina?" Check. That other boy -- Tom -- becomes Billy's first boyfriend and they cap
off graduation by touring Europe. But Tom is a hopelessly jealous lover so averse to the idea of women
and that dreaded vagina that he literally throws up again and again at the possibility. Once he throws up
simply because Billy is reading Madame Bovary  to him.
Time and again Irving seems to be worried that we'll forget Billy is bisexual or exactly what bisexualmeans. If Billy isn't interested in a girl, we're told not to worry, he likes breasts. It's just her  breasts that
don't interest him. This would be fine once but Irving seems pushed to explain Billy's proclivities againand again as if we might be confused. It doesn't help that Billy feels cursed never to be satisfied with justa man or a woman (or just guys or girls), playing into the old stereotype that a bisexual could never befaithful or satisfied with just one person. Now any particular individual can be incapable of monogamy,of course, be they straight or gay or bisexual. But it seems more general here, hence Billy's fascination
with those who are transgendered and/or transitioning, as if only thus could he find "in one person"
everything he needs.
This book has the odd tone of a memoir in which the writer can't distinguish between what is important
and what's not. Stories are repeated again and again; at one point, Irving even acknowledges it, though
the slightly new detail added to that anecdote hardly made it worth rehashing. A deflating finale in which
Irving panders to the current vogue for not putting labels on people (as if gay, straight and bisexual
weren't quite handy descriptions for the vast majority of people) doesn't help matters. As always, he
writes with empathy and can spin a tale. But here his imagination is lacking and the erotic quotient isquite low. Billy agonizes a lot over who he is but rarely if ever do we sense the pleasure of desire.

The sequel did not measure up to Wolf Hall. Anne Boleyn's reign through the eyes of Thomas
Cromwell had so much potential. Too bad.

The bar was set very high of course. Maybe she'll pull it off in your estimation with the finalbook in the trilogy.

Wolf Hall is so brilliant, it is almost too much to hope that its sequel can match it. I've been awaitingthis next book with mixed emotions - I've become very fond of Thomas Cromwell and am notanxious to read about his undoing. I'm relieved that's a story for another time. Off to the localbookseller tomorrow.

I went to the bookstore, only to find that they had Bringing Up the Bodies but not Wolf Hall.
I didn't want to start with the second book, so I picked up A Place of Greater Safety -haven't had a chance to start it yet. No real point there, but you'd think they would have thecommon sense to have the 1st one on hand for people in my situation.
09:10 PM on 05/16/2012
Thanks so much for the tip on the Hitchens review. Yes - you'd think so - but nodoubt booksellers have problems of their own. As for his death being so far in thepast - it's going to feel like a loss for me, having come to like him so much. Theexecutioner did a very bad job.

I've been able to finish one John Irving book, TWATGarp, and it sounds like he's re-written it. Given
that Irving grew up, and wrestled, at a boarding school where his Stepdad worked, it sounds like
both are autobiographical. There was a transgendered character (who had been an athlete as amale; that seems to be a recurrent theme, perhaps because the author was a sexually ambivalentathlete himself) in Garp as well. Just tell me that there were no 'boy bites dog', or accidental penissevering stories in this one.It's funny how unoriginal and autobiographical some writers are - how many writers from NewEngland has Stephen King written about? If they'd been athletic, bi-sexual and grown up atboarding schools they could almost be John Irving characters.
11:11 PM on 05/17/2012
Certainly most writers -- even the very best -- come back again and again to the sameobsessions. I don't think this book feels like a rewrite of Garp but I also don't think it's verygood. Others who haven't read Garp or Cider House Rules should start there long beforethey get to this. But I wouldn't complain about Irving being in his milieu anymore than I'dcomplain about Faulkner staying in his world or John Ford making another western.Nothing wrong with another western, just make it a good one.
