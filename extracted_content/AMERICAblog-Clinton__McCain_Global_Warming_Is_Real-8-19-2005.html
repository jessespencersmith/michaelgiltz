8/19/2005 03:14:00 PMTwo likely Presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and John McCainwent to Alaska and stated the obvious: global warming is real,it's having a devastating effect TODAY and the sooner we act,the more we can limit the damage.Dan Lashof, a scientist with the Natural Resources DefenceCouncil, a respected Washington-based group, told TheIndependent: "People in Alaska are starting to freak out.The retreat of the sea ice allows the oceans to pound thecoast more, and villages there are suffering from the effectsof that erosion. There is permafrost melting, roads arebuckling, there are forests that have been infested withbeetles because of a rise in temperatures.
