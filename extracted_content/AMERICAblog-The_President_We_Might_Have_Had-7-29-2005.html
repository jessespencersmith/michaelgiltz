7/29/2005 02:57:00 PMA very good op-ed on Bush vs Gore, pointing out how Al Gore'stop priorities were right in line with the needs of America --Gore touted hybrid cars and energy conservation andrenewable sources (Bush mocked the hybrids that are now ahuge profit center...for foreign companies), Gore would haveused the power of the marketplace to get cheaper prescriptionsfor seniors (rather than benefitting the pharmaceuticalcompanies), Gore would have used the now-squanderedbudget surplus to strengthen Social Security, rather thansimply trying to destroy it and on and on. Very well done. Andhere's the kicker on terrorism:Would a Gore administration have connected the dots andprevented the horror of 9/11? That, of course, is impossibleto assess. What is crystal clear: No administration couldhave done worse than Mr. Bush and his people.Thanks to threader Laura Bee for pointing us to this.
