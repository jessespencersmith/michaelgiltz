            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  A P R I L  2 5 ,  2 0 0 6The Doors Maintain Their Rock N Roll IntegrityAfter years of feuding, drummer John Densmore and the othersurviving members of the Doors have finally reconciled. (Densmorestopped the other guys from touring as The Doors since he andobviously Jim Morrison weren't involved. He also blocked theirattempts to license songs for commercials.) As keyboardist RayManzarek put it in Rolling Stone, "Everything will be worked out. Inthe next year and a half [which coincides with their 40th anniversary],we're going to be honoring the excitement, the passion, the rebelliousnature that took place on the beach in Venice, California, in 1965,culminating in the Doors' first album in 1967." Wow and how will theyaccomplish this? With a Las Vegas spectacle, of course, due to open in2008 and described as "Laserium meets the Haunted Mansion."Because nothing says rock n roll like a Disney theme park ride. Oh, andthey're ready to sell their songs for commercials. Said the purer thanpure Densmore, "We might consider something technology-oriented orsome hybrid car or something, but it's gotta be right."POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
