A young filmmaker proves that 
hard works pays off BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
irector Gideon Raff has been a best-selling author 
in his home country of Israel, a columnist for that 
country's largest newspaper and a paratrooper in 
the military. But the most important job he ever got 
was as an intern. 
That's how it works in Hollywood . 
"You have to start from the bottom." 
says Raff, 33, whose first feature, "The 
Killing Floor," is touring the festival cir­
cuit and is already sold in 20 countries . 
"You've got to work hard and impress 
the right people." 
Clearly, Raff did, even though he in­
sists jokingly he's "the worst schmooz­
er ever." Studying at the American Film 
Institute in LA., Raff was able to im­
press Avi Arad, the former Marvel ex­
ecutive who's been a force behind top 
comic-book film franchises like Make-A-Wish foundation ; and Liman -
knowing he was a writer and aspiring 
filmmaker -kept asking to see what 
Raff was working on. The result? "The 
Killing Floor," Raff's first feature, has 
two major blue-chip executive produc­
ers in Liman and Arad. 
A Hitchcock-flavored thriller about 
a publishing executive who specializes 
in horror writers, "The Killing Floor" 
finds the cocky, conceited hero (Marc 
Blucas of "The Alamo" and TV's "Buffy 
The Slayer'') suddenly tar-... ,. 
"X-Men" and "Spider-Man ." 
Arad loved Raff's short film 
"The Babysitter " -star­
ring "7th Heaven" regu-
lar Jeremy Lelliott -and 
kept Raff on his radar. 
Then Raff took that cru­
cial internship at the film 
production company New 
Regency. That company got 
involved in the massive block-Raft parlayed 
an internship 
into a 
directing gig. someone just as diabol­
as the villains he's been 
to life for years. 
"It's right on the border 
between a psychological 
thriller and a horror film," 
says Raff. "There's a lit­
tle gore. The movies I like 
the most are ... scary, but 
there's a human story be­
ingtold." 
buster "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" and be­
fore he knew it, Raff was an assistant 
to director Doug Liman ("Swingers," 
"Go," "The Bourne Identity") and 
running interference for "Smith" stars 
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie as the 
media swarmed around word of their 
burgeoning relationship. 
"What they do is they send you out 
with a flashlight and you point at the 
papparazzi's cameras to block their 
view," explains Raff, who says you 
can't appreciate the intensity of the 
media glare until you see it up close. 
"At a certain point, it became crazy 
because of the rumors." 
Raff got to film Pitt for a video for the Shot on location in New York 
in 25 days, Raff got no sleep during 
production but says the most nerve­
wracking moment was when his ma­
jor Hollywood producer, Liman, visit­
ed the set. Raff speaks admiringly of 
top Israeli filmmakers like Amos Gi­
tai and Eytan Fox, but for a kid whose 
first movie memory is of a James Bond 
movie, nothing beats Hollywood . 
"I want to make Israeli films, I do," 
says Raff, who was born and raised in 
Jerusalem and lived for a while in Tel 
Aviv before coming to the U.S. "But my 
interests and sensibilities are definitely 
Hollywood . I wanted to be here for my 
studies and the first years of my career. 
I feel very privileged to be here." •</p>
