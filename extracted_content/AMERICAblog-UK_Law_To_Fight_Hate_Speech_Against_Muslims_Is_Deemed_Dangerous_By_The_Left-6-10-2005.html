6/10/2005 02:41:00 PMIn the US, the far right would be freaking out over a law that"protected Satanists" by banning hate speech directed towardspeople of faith -- political correctness, they'd call it. The UKlaw, intended to provide coverage for Muslims that Jews andSikhs enjoy because of race-based laws against inciting hatred,would also provide new protection for Satanists, pagans andeven atheists. (Republicans would defeat it in a minute bycalling this the Devil Worshipping Act.)But in Great Britain, the law is being criticized by the left,which thinks it goes too far in making ideas illegal. Many alsomake the point that mocking someone's religion is not thesame as mocking their race. Many major comedians andthinkers on the left see it as a dangerous encroachment on freespeech. Well-intentioned measure or a law trying to banblasphemy?The actor and writer Stephen Fry told Radio 4's PMprogramme that the Bill was "rather shaming" and "anembarrassment to the statute book"."It just suggests it's not a thought-through or neededpiece of legislation," he said. "It is something toplease communities."The author Salman Rushdie has complained that themeasure would "sacrifice freedom of speech in orderto placate Muslim voters".Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: "Thisoffence is capable of catching attacks on ideas as wellas people. "At best this is an empty sop to acommunity sorely let down by government. At worst itis a dangerous new blasphemy law out of step withour best traditions."David Davis, the shadow Home Secretary, said the lawwould be "massively counter-productive" and"seriously undermine freedom of speech". He said:"Religion, unlike race, is a matter of personal choiceand therefore appropriate for open debate."
