9/01/2004 02:09:00 AMThe talks to disarm Sadr's rebels in a Baghdad City ghetto havecollapsed. Meanwhile, a militant Islamic group has slaughtered 12Nepalese laborers. And a Sunday New York Times front page storydetailed with depressing vividness how two other major cities --Falluja and Ramadi -- are firmly in the hands of Islamic militants whoare imposing a Taliban-like rule of law. Yep, they're lashing andbeheading common criminals, and anyone considered a stooge forthe US is publicly humiliated and THEN beheaded. The videotapes ofthese are on sale in the local marketplace for 50 cents. The USmilitary is a bystander in all of this. And these cities are strategicallycrucial for control of Iraq. US officials now concede elections inJanuary are a dim possibility at best. Did we mention the alreadypaltry oil production has been halved by attacks on oil pipelines andother locations? Of course, no one mentions Afghanistan - the KoreanWar of our day -- where the Taliban is firmly ensonced in thecountryside and by some accounts controls one-third of the countryalong with warlords.Hey, John Kerry. Try this: when Bush mocks you for not extolling thesituation in Iraq and Afghanistan, mock him back. Beheadings? Athird of Afghanistan in control of the Taliban and its allies? Islamicmilitants mocking the US in major cities in Iraq and gaining control ofmore and more territory? Maybe that's Bush's idea of "MissionAccomplished" but it sure isn't yours or the American peoples.
