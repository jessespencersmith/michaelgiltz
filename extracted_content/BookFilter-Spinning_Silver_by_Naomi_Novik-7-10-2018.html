Spinning Silver
A Novel
by Naomi Novik
Price: $28.00 (Hardcover)
Published: July 10, 2018
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: A fresh and imaginative retelling of the
Rumpelstiltskin fairy tale from the bestselling author of Uprooted,which was hailed as “a very enjoyable fantasy with the air of a modernclassic” by The New York Times Book Review . With the Nebula Award–
winning Uprooted,  Naomi Novik opened a brilliant new chapter in an
already acclaimed career, delving into the magic of fairy tales to craft alove story that was both timeless and utterly of the now. Spinning Silverdraws readers deeper into this glittering realm of fantasy, where the
boundary between wonder and terror is thinner than a breath, and safety
can be stolen as quickly as a kiss. Miryem is the daughter andgranddaughter of moneylenders, but her father’s inability to collect hisdebts has left his family on the edge of poverty—until Miryem takesmatters into her own hands. Hardening her heart, the young woman sets
out to claim what is owed and soon gains a reputation for being able to
turn silver into gold. When an ill-advised boast draws the attention of theking of the Staryk—grim fey creatures who seem more ice than flesh—Miryem’s fate, and that of two kingdoms, will be forever altered. Set an
impossible challenge by the nameless king, Miryem unwittingly spins a web
that draws in a peasant girl, Wanda, and the unhappy daughter of a locallord who plots to wed his child to the dashing young tsar. But TsarMirnatius is not what he seems. And the secret he hides threatens toconsume the lands of humans and Staryk alike. Torn between deadly
choices, Miryem and her two unlikely allies embark on a desperate quest
that will take them to the limits of sacrifice, power, and love. Channelingthe vibrant heart of myth and fairy tale, Spinning Silver  weaves a
multilayered, magical tapestry that readers will want to return to again
and again. Advance praise for Spinning Silver  “A book as cool and
mysterious as a winter’s night, with two marvelous heroines at its heart.
Spinning Silver  pits the cold of endless winter against the fires of duty,
love, and sacrifice. I couldn’t put it down.” —Katherine Arden, New York
Times  bestselling author of The Bear and the Nightingale  “Naomi Novik
knows how to weave words into magic, and Spinning Silver  enchants the
reader from the first page. This magnificent tale of three courageousyoung women who find the power to change their fates will catch you inits spell and linger long after the last chapter is read.” —Christina Henry,
nationally bestselling author of The Mermaid

What We Say
She's done it again. Naomi Novik launched her career with the delightful conceit of combining the Napoleonic era with
dragons...talking, thinking, querulous dragons who sometimes wonder why they don't have the same rights as humans, or atleast the same respect that dragons enjoy in China. It's the sort of musing that might make any human riding on their backs
a little...nervous. The Temeraire series began as a paperback-only release but garnered excellent reviews and a growing
legion of fans. Ten books were planned but, just after the eighth, Novik delivered a stand-alone fantasy novel called"Uprooted." Digging deep into Polish folklore, it was remarkable and took Novik to an entirely new level. The Temeraireseries ended (rather abruptly, to me) with the ninth and final volume. It was a very good and sometimes great series, butNovik was stretching her own wings. Now here comes "Spinning Silver." Nominally inspired by the tale of Rumplestiltskin, it
too is a stand-alone novel every bit as good as "Uprooted" and sure to be just as successful. Our heroine is Miryem, the
Jewish daughter of a moneylender. Her father isn't a very good moneylender; he's rather embarrassed to ask people to payup and takes any excuse with good cheer. So naturally people put him off as long as possible or simply never pay. Theyoung girl loves him and doesn't mind so much. But when her mother becomes ill and their genteel poverty threatens to kill
the mom and leave them homeless, she becomes rather determined. Miryem finds the fortitude to confront the people who
owe them money. Her persistence and perhaps their mild feelings of shame result in her becoming a very good moneylenderindeed. Suddenly, the family isn't just surviving; they are flourishing. Miryem unthinkingly boasts that she can spin silver intogold. And that's when the real problems begin. Like "Uprooted," this book is bursting with characters that are bitingly alive-- real, complicated, confounding and delightful. Even when they surprise, you think well of course that's what they would
do. For a while, the book alternates between Miryem and a servant named Wanda. You assume this is the pattern of the
book, when suddenly another character takes over the narrative for a chapter: the daughter of a nobleman who looks set tobe married off in desultory fashion. And then another and another voice is added: the little brother of Wanda, theunexpected husband of that soon-to-be-wed daughter and more, each of them captivating and distinct. Novik does not
create some imaginary fantasy world with an elaborate set of rules, Toklein style. (Though she does give a fire demon a
very Tolkein-esque name.) No, Novik sets her story in the folk tale world of our youth, but one that is far more realisticand rich than any you'll find in Grimm. As with "Uprooted," you won't discover a battle between good and evil but a battlebetween people and mythic characters, all of whom have their motivations and fears and desires, making the idea of
"heroes" and "villains" seem positively childish by the end. Winter battles with spring, two worlds existing side by side try to
swallow each other up and it's all gripping and funny and so, so good. At one stage almost smack in the middle of thenarrative, Novik brings together two storylines in a way I hadn't expected and it made me smile with delight. That wasn'tthe first or the last time. Any book with a terrific opening, a mic drop closing and not a faltering moment in between is tobe cherished. But beyond that, Novik is enriching the world of fantasy and folk tales with a depth of emotional complexity,
empathy and humanity not seen since the heyday of Ursula K. Le Guin, if ever. She's spinning silver into gold, indeed. --
