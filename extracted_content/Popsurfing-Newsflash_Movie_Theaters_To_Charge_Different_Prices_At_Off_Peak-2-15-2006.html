            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 6Newsflash: Movie Theaters To Charge DifferentPrices At Off-Peak!In a bizarrely out of touch column in the New York Times, they say thatjust around the corner is the possibility of variable pricing at movietheaters. That would be exciting, breaking news...if movie theatershadn't already been doing it for decades. Tuesday nights are oftenheavily discounted to encourage moviegoers on weekdays -- somethingthat has literally been around since at least the Seventies. And unlikeNew York City, almost every other town in the country offers matineeprices where people who go to a movie before, say, 5:30 p.m. pay less.Where the hell has the NYT been all these years to think variablepricing is a radical innovation? In fact, the change studios are makingisn't to discount off-peak hours but to charge MORE for prime timetickets and choice seats. (A few theaters in Manhattan annoyingly ropeoff some seats for reserved tickets that cost $5 extra.) Squeezing out afew extra bucks when most people want to go (as opposed to discountsto bring them in on off hours) is in fact a very stupid, shortsighted idea.Ticket sales are in a slump and their response is to charge more forFriday nights? Brilliant.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

And I'm mad as helland I'm just not going to take it any more.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
