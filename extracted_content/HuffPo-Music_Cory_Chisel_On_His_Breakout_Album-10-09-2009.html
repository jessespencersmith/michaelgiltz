The good news is piling up for musician Cory Chisel.
Death Won't Send A Letter  -- his first proper album for
a major label (RCA's Black Seal) -- is out in stores.Rolling Stone pegged him as one to watch . He and his
band The Wandering Sons make their network TVdebut tonight on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon  at
12:30 EST on NBC. Then he performs at Carnegie
Hall...ok Carnegie Hall's Zankel Theater (a really cool
space) on Saturday night. Then they'll be heading out on
a European tour. And if there are any radio deejays left
in the country who haven't been replaced by "Jack" andother computerized digital entities, they've probably
added his surging, addictive single "Born Again," a defining number he'll be playing for years to come.

<p>But in the crazy, post-radio world we live in, perhaps the best sign of Chisel's growing popularity came
with a TV show and a print ad for jeans. Chisel released a more acoustic EP called Cabin Ghosts  prior to
this album and one song -- "On My Side"  -- got prominent placement on the FOX hit House,  immediately
reaching millions of viewers.
"The placements in TV shows these days are about as big a thing as you can do anymore," says Chisel. "It
almost is the new radio. It's the new way people are finding out about a lot of music. And there are a lot
of really great shows like 'House' or 'Mad Men' or 'True Blood.' We were assured by the people that it was
going to be a poignant moment. I was happy and felt like it advanced the plot. A lot of people heard the
song and we see people almost every night that that's how they heard [of] us."
And don't discount the importance of a good pair of jeans, especially when it's Lucky Brand Jeans and
they're highlighting your music, not to mention a favorite hometown pizzeria in a national ad campaign.
"That ran in Rolling Stone and, like, Vogue. That's another thing I wasn't so sure about," admits Chisel.
"You want to be as much about the music as possible. But I really liked the idea of the campaign. They
said, 'In a world where it's really hard to break new artists, we want to put your face out there.' They were
showcasing painters and photographers and young upstart people that were making new and differentthings. Obviously they're trying to advance their brand's image. It was one of the nicest paydays I've had.
I think I lived off of that and I think that helped me make my record as much as anything else if you
want to know the truth -- affording us the ability to stay alive while we made up our mind what kind ofmusic we're making.
Despite the TV shows and the commercials, Chisel maintains a rootsy, rebellious appeal. He's based inthe heartland - Appleton, Wisconsin to be exact -- and was the stereotypical son of a preacher man; inother words, trouble. He was the sort of kid who wore a mohawk and rude t-shirts and did anything he
could to get a rise out of his Baptist minister father and piano teacher mother. (Chisel says if he got any
work ethic it was from his diligent mom, even though he was too "pig-headed" to take lessons from her.)
"I was really the kind of kid I hope I don't have," he laughs.
"I had duo hawks at one point," says Chisel, chatting on a cell phone while traveling to Grand Rapids,
Michigan for a show. "Anything to piss my parents off. And they really hated that one. I'd wear the Nazi
punk f--- off shirt, so they couldn't exactly be mad about what I was saying."
As these things usually go, Chisel was looking to rile his dad but ended up upsetting his mom. ("I'm going
to write the perfect 'mother' song and make it up to her," he promises.) They all found common ground inmusic: mom played the piano while dad preached and Cory was dragooned into the choir, which rarely
amounted to more than a few 80 year old men and a handful of unhappy kids. Chisel insists it was the
music of the hymns like "That Old Rugged Cross" that moved him more than the lyrics. But clearly someof that religious imagery seeped in; as with Springsteen and U2, his songs are layered with allusions tothe Bible. And while they rarely met eye to eye when it came to the music they wanted to hear, Chisel
scored points when he wrote his own tunes, something he began to do as a teenager.
"Usually if I had made the music, they couldn't dismiss it in the same way," says the 27 year old Chisel,
who is married to a high school English teacher and lives on a small farm in Appleton. "I couldn't turn on
the Clash and expect Joe Strummer would expand my mom's mind. Oftentimes I would ape thesentiments and put it in my own music and see if she could swallow that pill.

<p>Billie Jean is King: the
ultimate athlete was 32years old and closetedwhen transgender Renee"I never really did want my parents to hate me. You find that phase where you want to be respected as a
thinker. My dad has a way with words, for sure, so winning an argument in the household? The only way
you're going to do it is if your guitar is louder than his preaching voice."
At least everyone could agree on one thing: Johnny Cash.
"If anybody rebels by not listening to Johnny Cash, they're making a horrible error," says Chisel. "Johnny
Cash has always been the figure that I've admired the most. People let him be both things: they let him bean outlaw and a friend, spiritual and pagan. He's one of the lucky artists who've been viewed as a whole
person. That's something I was always really really turned on by. He was the guy that my mom liked that
was naughty. If people can't find common ground with him, I don't think we need to be friends."
But for all his talk of rebellion and the pleasing image of an uptight dad driven to distraction by his wild
son, the truth is more complicated. Chisel talks about debating issues of faith with his father, but not in
the conservative vs liberal way one might imagine. He proudly talks about his dad refusing to preach on
issues he didn't believe -- such as condemning gays. Ultimately, according to Chisel, it cost his dad his
job.
So while preaching and staying true to your faith sometimes does  mean rebelling, rock and roll often
involves working well with others. First you have to work with a band. Then -- if you're lucky -- you
collaborate with producers and other talented musicians. When Brendan Benson of The Raconteurs
agreed to meet with Chisel, he and his band-mate and musical sounding board Adriel Harris agreed theriff from the song in progress "Born Again" was one to play.
"I'm pretty sure it was her idea to blow that one by him because I'd kind of reached an impasse," says
Chisel. "I had that piece and I knew it was smart and meant something to me. I had that line -- 'Mommadidn't raise me to be no Christian' -- and we both kind of come from a similar background and it kind of
made both of us go, 'Oh shit!' What are we saying with this? We might get in trouble with this.
"We played it with Brendan. He has an enormous amount of energy and a killer pop sense. I tend to
default on the side of making things sort of wordy and masked. He picked up on that song and said,
'You've got to tell this story and just tell it. And don't worry about hiding its meaning.'"
It might have been intimidating to work with an artist who has collaborated with the likes of Jack White
and has just released the best album of his career, My Old familiar Friend. Happily, they had some
things in common.
"We're both kind of closeted...not even closeted -- we're fully open winos, I guess. We like wine a lot.
There's this place in Nashville called Marche  that has good wine so we met there for dinner and talked
about everything but music. He's from Detroit and it was just really easy to see we were going to getalong. It sounds more like we're hooking up for a date more than making music," he laughs. "So wedecided to go back to the place where we were staying and have another bottle of wine."
And what wine were they drinking?
"If I remember it wouldn't have been a good party. So I have no recollection of what we were drinking. I
was just showing him on an acoustic guitar songs I had written. Then he said, 'Show me something that
you haven't  done. Show me something you love that you're hiding because every writer is hiding
something they love.' After the earlier conversation with Adriel about ["Born Again"], I just played him
this riff and sang him the first few lines and literally he practically grabbed the guitar out of my hands
and just started helping me bang out this chorus. We were thinking of somewhere along the lines of arevival song and 'With A Little Help From My Friends,' because it was this new friendship that wasblooming and we were working on our first record [together] and we wanted that excitement to be in the
tune. It was done -- the way I remember it -- in less than an hour."
