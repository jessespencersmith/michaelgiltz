Weaver, the legal counsel for the Ohio Republican Party, saidtoday that party officials had instructed the challengers to lie low atthe polls and act more as observers than contestants," reports theNew York Times.""Given the Democrats' clear strategy of trying to turn each challengeinto a ruckus," Mr. Weaver said, "we wanted to make to sure topreserve the right to keep our observers in the polling places.""He added, "If there's litigation later, these will be contemporaneousnotes about what happened at these polling places.""
