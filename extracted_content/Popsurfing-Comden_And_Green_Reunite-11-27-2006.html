            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6Comden And Green ReuniteBetty Comden -- half of the legendary duo Comden and Green -- isdead at 89. Bizarrely, the New York Times obit only mentions "SingingIn The Rain" in passing. I have two modest Comden and Green stories.I was making a phone call at the Public in the days before cell phoneswere common. The woman at the phone next to me looked veryfamiliar and I thought maybe she was a journalist of some sort andkept glancing at her. Sne waved me over, introduced herself and askedme to help her friend Adolph find his way to the Public. (They werestaging a terrific revival of "On The Town" and Adolph Green couldn'tfigure out how to tell a cabbie the way to get to the Public.) How couldComden and Green not know their way around Manhattan? ("NewYork, New York, a hellava town. The Bronx is up and the Battery'sdown. The people ride through a hole in the ground....") Nonetheless, Igot to give him directions, tell her "On The Town" was my favoritemovie musical and then she asked if I were an actor. "No, " I saidimmediately," but if I were I'd be comic relief." She laughed and I washappy for days. Years later, I saw Adolph Green crossing a trickyintersection at 71st and Broadway, looking a bit lost and confused, andI discretely walked alongside him to make sure he got to the cornersafely without letting him know I was doing so. Soon after, he died.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
