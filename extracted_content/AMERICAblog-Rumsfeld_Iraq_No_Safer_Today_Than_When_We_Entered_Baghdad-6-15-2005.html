6/15/2005 08:05:00 PMAccording to the Times of London, Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld told David Frost on BBC's Newsnight that okay, yes,fine, Iraq is "statistically" no safer today than it was at the endof the war. After further prodding, Rummy admitted sure, if youwant to get technical, the insurgency was stronger today thanwhen the US took over the country (Rummy said when "theCoalition" took over, but give me a break).And who does Rummy blame? His own foolish policy of minimaltroops that still can't keep the peace? (Thomas Friedman callsfor doubling the troops there in today's New York Times.)Nope. Does Rummy blame Saudi Arabia, the world's numberone funder of terrorism and which has spread radical Islamthroughout the Muslim world? Wrong again. Does he blamePakistan, which has sold weapons and know-how to terroristgroups around the world? Nah. Does Rummy blame his ownfailure to secure ANY of the massive stockpiles of weapons thatthe UN had its eye on, that the US knew were there and whichinsurgents plundered long after Baghdad fell and which havenow turned those weapons against our men and women inuniform? No, no, no.Rummy blames...Syria. Uh, Syria, you might want to remainvery still and very, very quiet for the next 3 and a half years.
