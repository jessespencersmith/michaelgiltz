3/03/2005 09:51:00 PMUSA Today reports that the Army recruited 5,114 soldiers inFebruary, 1,936 fewer than its goal. This dramatic shortfall innew soldiers happened even though the Army has morerecruiters than ever and is offering record cash bonuses to newrecruits -- up to $20,000 if you commit to four years. TheMarine Corp missed its target in January for the first time in adecade. Also, everyone has soaked up all the "delayed entry"people who usually ensure a steady stream of new soldiers.This problem began in the National Guard and Reserve and isnow spreading to active recruits. It's going to get worse andworse and worse over the coming year. (It's hard to imagineANYONE who would sign up right now for anything other thanthe Air Force and Navy -- which are far away from danger inIraq.)USA Today quotes one analyst who says recruiting will probably"fall off a cliff" this year.Bush's shameful abuse of the original intent of the Reservesand National Guard, his backdoor draft that forces people whohave fulfilled their duty to this country and sometimes evenretired to go back to the front lines, his disrespect for soldiersas reflected in the miserable health care they are receiving, hisdisregard for their safety (has the MSM done any updates onproper armor for cars, tanks etc in Iraq? Nope) and generaldisdain for our men and women in uniform is going to have aDISASTROUS effect on our nation's ability to protect itself andproject power around the world for years if not decades tocome.
