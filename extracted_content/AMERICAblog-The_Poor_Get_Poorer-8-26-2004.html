8/26/2004 01:13:00 PMBush's economic plan -- focus most tax cuts on the super rich,balloon the deficit and create huge new entitlement programs thatline the coffers of big business rather than making health care trulymore affordable -- continues to reap big dividends.Yep, the new Census figures show 1.3 million more Americans livingin poverty in 2003 and 1.4 million more Americans are uninsured.That's the third straight annual increase for both these categories, soif he's really lucky, Bush could go 4 for 4. Go Bush!Hardest hit of all? Kids. Per the New York Times,"Approximately 35.8 million people lived below the poverty line in2003, or about 12.5 percent of the population, according to thebureau. That was up from 34.5 million, or 12.1 percent in 2002."The rise was more dramatic for children. There were 12.9 millionliving in poverty last year, or 17.6 percent of the under-18population. That was an increase of about 800,000 from 2002, when16.7 percent of all children were in poverty."
