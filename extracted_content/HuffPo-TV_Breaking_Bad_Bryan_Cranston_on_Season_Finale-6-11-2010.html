The best show on TV? Right now, it's unquestionably
Breaking Bad,  the AMC drama about a high school
chemistry teacher who starts cooking up crystal methwhen he discovers he has cancer and may not be ableto provide for his family. The Season Three finale is
Sunday night at 10 p.m. and actor Bryan Cranston  is
relishing the critical success of the series.
Not many actors have been in two hit TV shows
(Cranston was an Emmy nominee of course for the
groundbreaking sitcom Malcolm in the Middle ). Even
fewer have been in a hit sitcom and a hit drama. But
perhaps only Ed Asner (with The Mary Tyler Moore
Show  and Lou Grant ) has previously been in a sitcom and drama that were both so critically acclaimed.
For Cranston, who worked steadily for 20 years before finally getting his big break on Malcolm , they are
literally the roles of a lifetime.
"It was a stroke of luck - twice - so I'm just very fortunate and always recognize that fact," says the 54
year old actor. "Who knows where it's going to take me from here? This may be the lead line in my
obituary and if it is, that's fine by me."

<p>For a man who emphasizes repeatedly that it all begins with the writing, he was clear before even landing
the role that Breaking Bad was the perfect follow-up to the broad comedy of the hapless, fear-driven
Hal.
"I knew it when I read the script that it was going to be a special show," says Cranston. "I knew  it. I
didn't know it was going to be successful; no one knows that. But I knew it was going to be good."
But Breaking Bad  has likely exceeded even his expectations. For two years in a row, Cranston has won
the Emmy for Best Actor, winning out over Jon Hamm for AMC's Mad Men  (winner of Best Drama of
course), Michael C. Hall for Dexter  and numerous others (actors and shows he cites as examples of
quality TV). For years, Cranston wasn't even nominated for his work on Malcolm  until its creator touted
his work at the Emmys itself and he joked repeatedly about the empty shelf space reserved for his
statues. Now, that shelf space is filling up.
"The standard line is that it's an honor just to be nominated," says Cranston. "That may be, but it's a lot
more fun to win."
And his career is a lot more fun, too. Cranston has more than 100 credits on IMDB , but the wild success
of Malcolm  didn't bring him the added oomph he deserved to snag bigger and better roles in film. (When
someone is good in a comedy, people say, "Oh, they're funny." When someone is good in a drama, they
say, "Oh, they can act.")
That's finally changed with Breaking Bad.  Cranston has a string of roles in prominent films, including
Love Ranch (about the first legal brothel), a World War II film about the Tuskegee airmen overseen by
George Lucas, the future summer blockbuster John Carter Of Mars  (starring Taylor Kitsch of another
great TV show, Friday Night Lights ) and Larry Crowne,  which is written and directed and stars Tom
Hanks, who has championed Cranston via projects like From The Earth To The Moon  to Saving Private
Ryan  to That Thing You Do!
"It's a dramedy and I am an author and the husband of Julia Roberts. That's a nice role to have. I can
think of very few roles I'd rather have," says Cranston. It's nice unless Larry Crowne (the Hankscharacter, an unemployed businessman who goes back to college) steals away your gal, right?
"Well, when he's writing his own movie, he does have the tendency to make himself the star," jokes
Cranston in mock indignation.
So the success and growing recognition is sweet. But it wouldn't be so much fun if the show weren't so
good. It began with an outrageous, catchy premise: high school chem teacher turned drug dealer. And forthree seasons, Breaking Bad has deepened that premise and crafted surprising people remarkably well,
including Cranston and his drug addict sidekick Aaron Paul (rightly nominated for an Emmy as well last
year for his exceptional work). It was created by Vince Gilligan, a major contributor to The X-Files,including an episode called "Drive" back in 1998 that Cranston appeared in.
Every character -- from Cranston's accountant wife to his DEA brother-in-law to Giancarlo Esposito's
chillingly self-possessed drug lord -- has become more and more fascinating. And Cranston's Walter H.
White has grown from a man acting in desperation to a sometimes ruthless operator we're not even sure
we should still like. It's as if we met Tony Soprano before  he became a gangster and watched his descent.
Here's a look at the first scene of the pilot episode.

<p>Cranston loves the ambiguity of the show and even questions my suggestion that the premise was
outrageous.
"I don't know if the premise is that outlandish," he says. "We see examples of this in the news all the
time. How many times do we see a news report where the neighbor went berserk and kills? And theneighbor says, 'He was so quiet and nice and I can't believe it. He's the last person I would expect to be a
counterfeiter' or whatever.
"I think we assume -- because of how most people live their lives -- we assume that everyone else is pretty
much the same. We have no idea  what goes on behind closed doors. And that's what is really interesting
and intriguing about the whole thing."
And viewers have no idea week to week what to expect on Breaking Bad.  One outstanding episode this
season, "Fly," featured almost nothing but Cranston and Paul in a meth lab trying to kill a fly that had
snuck into their room. It was bold and unconventional but also wildly suspenseful as we wonderedwhether Cranston's character would spill the beans about a secret that was haunting him. His wife (Anna
Gunn of Deadwood ) has gone from an unsuspecting spouse to a woman determined to divorce him to
now pushing to take over the accounting so he doesn't get caught laundering money.
"I was really happy to see this season Anna Gunn's character really be fleshed out and realized," says
Cranston. "It pointed out to me how important her character is to the anchor of this show. We all try to
function as the foundation of Breaking Bad. "
Then of course there's Cranston himself, who has relished moments like confronting a drug dealer trying
to horn in on his territory to the scene where his wife spins an elaborate lie (a funny scene given weight
when he asks her where she came up with it and she responds stingingly that she learned from the best)
to a show-stopping moment last season where he watches a young woman die. Wasn't it exciting to dothat, as an actor?
"Yes and at the same time it's horrifying," says Cranston. "I look at this little girl who is dying and you
can't help but personalize it and I think of my daughter dying and that's when it brought me to tears and
shame and regret and finally acceptance. I just went through so many emotions at that point and the
final one is 'move on, let it go.'"
But one of the hallmarks of the show is consequences. You can't just move on from your bad actions
because every deed has repercussions. Every single one. Every lie, every cover-up, every attempt toappease one person rebounds in painful and unexpected ways. It's brilliant and funny and moving andCranston understands perfectly when I say I want the series to end soon. Not because the show is close to
running out of creativity, but just the opposite: the only thing harder than creating a great TV show is
ending it well. Very few TV shows manage to do it. But the people on Breaking Bad  seem keen to
accomplish that feat. Creator Gilligan initially said he imagined the show should end at four seasons. But
since the first season was only seven episodes long, he can be excused for not sticking to that target.
Cranston supports the idea 100 percent when I say five seasons and out.
"I think it's going to be something like that. I really do," says Cranston, who mentions that season four
won't begin filming until January of 2011 and may air during the summer. "All of us have expressed aninterest in protecting the integrity of the show and the rule that we established that here's a man who is
going to be dead within a year and a half to two years. And I can pretty much guarantee and I amTOP VIDEO PICKS

Natalie Portman: I

During...honestly telling you this because I don't know how it's going to end and I haven't asked [Vince Gilligan]
and I don't want to know, it will probably end with me dying in some way, to stay true. I would certainly
think that is the way to go.
"I think there are enough stories to tell and enough time before the complete transformation of this
character and others to tell this story in five seasons. I think it's legitimate without overstaying ourwelcome. Beyond five, possibly  six but no more than that. Then there's the sense of commerce; you want
to be good to the people who pay you to be here and that's AMC and Sony. There will be discussions as towhen we should let it go. I think Vince and I would convince them it's time to let go so that we can assure
that we can look back and be proud of all the seasons that we did as a journey and needing all of them
and not stay a moment longer than we should."
If you're already watching Breaking Bad , you are certainly primed for the season finale. If you haven't
watched the show, you've got 33 terrific episodes to dive into. You can Netflix or purchase seasons one
and two on DVD and purchase season three on iTunes or wait for it to come out later. (It's not on Hulu
yet.) With all the ways of watching TV, you never have to feel a serialized drama has passed you by. Don't
let this one: it ranks with The Wire  as an absolute peak of TV drama from the past 10 years.

Already can't wait until next season.. Best Show on TV.. 
well.. at least there is True Blood to tide me over..
This is a must see show. Every episode is amazingly written and acted, I can not wait to see what
happens next. I don't know how I am going to wait until next Summer to see the next season. My
only problem with the show (if you can call it that) is that every time I tell some one about the
premise of the show, no one seems to want to give it a chance, they hear the word meth and that'sit. They don't know what they are missing out on.MORE BIG NEWS PAGES  »

If there is a problem with this show its the LOOOONNNGG G wait times for the next season to
start...
I know, but if it keeps the show on, I can wait. At least it isn't 18 months like The Sopranos
was getting to be. I read that each show cost $3 million to shoot. On location. Timemagazine just had a good article about it.
Looking forward to Rubicon, and other shows in between (True Blood, Drop Dead Diva,
etc.). No Mad Men.
Haven't seen the full finale, but the first 15-20 minutes were great. Loved that they showed
Skyler and Walt moving into their house.
Ditto to momca54's comment about Bryan Cranston.
It has been fascinatin g to watch Walter's transforma tion. Brian Cranston has made a memorable
character and deserves every acolade he has recieved.
I would like to thank Mr. Cranston for his outstandin g work on Breaking Bad. I have been a fan of
this show from season 1, episode 1. Excellent work. Keep up the good work Mr. Cranston.
By the way, Malcolm in the middle was anything but groundbrea king. It was the carbon copy of a
groundbrea king original "Married with Children " 
Thanks.
Please don't forget that the show is also on Blu-ray, and support getting more dramas in that
format, the show looks and sounds amazing in high def
Breaking Bad is the best thing on TV. It forces people to think about morality in a way that no other
show does. This strikes home when you realize that you are rooting for, and empathize with a methdealer. The world of meth isn't sanitized, and the characters that Cranston and Paul deal with arevery true to real life. It brings back feelings that I haven't felt for 20 odd years, from fear to theexhilarati ng nose burn, you just have to trust me on that. The fact that you can go from laughing to
cringing in an hour and feel the need for a shower after is only possible, because of great writingand acting. I do agree with others about the authors oversight of Aaron Paul, who is fantastic asPermalink  | Share it

Jesse Pinkman. I can't say enough good things about this show, and while I'll be sad to see it go, I
am glad to hear that the plan is to have it come to final conclusion while it is still strong.
I agree Aaron Paul is fantastic, as is the entire cast. I actually had more in but cut it
because the post was so long. I unintentio nally cut out my first reference to Aaron, which is
why he's just referred to as "Paul" towards the bottom. My initial ref to him did indeed rave
and I'm gonna put it back in to clarify who I'm referring to. I'd love to profile him too, but thepiece was focused on Cranston.
I describe to the ignorant, that Breaking Bad is a cross between McGyver and The Sopranos.
Breaking Bad rocks, blue rocks.
The finale was great, can't wait for next season!
This is a wonderful opinion. The things mentioned are great and needs to be appreciate d by
everyone..
Budget Travel
This show is ridiculous ly good. It's truly great art.
I picked up on this show about 1/3 the way into the first season. I still have not seen the first 3
episodes and that will soon change. I can say this about the show and real life; in real life younever know what the unintended consequenc es might be, while in the show, you often see what
they can be.
Great Show, great acting, only one problem. What the receipe for the Blue Crystal? Just kidding.Permalink  | Share it
