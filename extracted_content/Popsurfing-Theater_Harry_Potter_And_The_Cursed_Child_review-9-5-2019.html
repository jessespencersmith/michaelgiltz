THEATER: "HARRY POTTER" ON BROADWAY!
FINALLY!!
HARRY  POTTER  AND  THE  CURSED  CHILD  *** out of ****
THE  CIRCLE  SERIES  AT  CIRCLE  IN  THE  SQUARE
It's been on Broadway for 17 months. Friends of mine saw it even
earlier in London. The acclaimed original cast has moved on. And nowI've FINALLY seen Harry  Potter  and  the  Cursed  Child.  A few shows
each year slip through my grasp and this was one of them -- a shame,
since I know the books backwards and forwards and have impressed
nieces and nephews for years with the fact that I interviewed J.K.Rowling many, many years ago. But times are tight and money is tootight to mention so what could I do? I entered the digital lottery atTodayTix .  And then I entered it the next week. And the next and the
next and some 80 or so drawings later, I won!! Here are somethoughts.
THE  LYRIC  IS  GORGEOUS  -- Once a barn of a theater, the Lyric
was the home of Spiderman-Man:  Turn  Off  The  Dark.  That felt more
like a circus than a musical and the cavernous space felt appropriate.
But it's been completely renovated for this show. The back wall hasbeen moved forward to make it somewhat more intimate. (It nowseats some 1,600 people, rather than 1,866 seats at its peak.) Andliterally every detail is thoughtful and handsome, from the "H"
stitched into the carpeting to the two levels of box seats on the side a
la the opera and just...everything. It's so handsome that one weeps tothink they may have to un-renovate it for landmark reasons when theshow leaves. On the bright side, that won't happen for years and years.
THE  PLAY  WORKS  FOR  MUGGLES  -- Like I said, I know the
books quite well and saw all the films and even took the test at
Pottermore  to determine I belong in House Ravenclaw if and when I
get a scholarship to Hogwarts. I also read the script for the play whenit was published and thought, Gee, this won't make a lick of sense to
anyone who HASN'T read the books or seen the movies. Not quite. MyMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

SHOWBIZ SANDBOX #463:
Why Is A TV Special</p>
<p>guest had read the first book and seen a few of the early movies. So he
wasn't a novice exactly but he certainly isn't steeped in Rowling. The
show worked a charm for him. After each act, he did tend to have a
brief question or two about a reference made by this or that character.I happily expounded at geeky length. Undoubtedly, the play will be farmore powerful for those who do love the books. But arrive fiveminutes early and read the summaries of the books (or just Book 8)
and you'll be fine.
NO  BUTTER  BEER?  -- The merchandise was copious and good-
looking. (I was tempted by the all-black coffee mugs.) But I was
astonished not to see Butter Beer available at the bar. Or some of the
Potter-centric candies at the snack bar. (Perhaps I missed some, but Idon't think so.) Ah well, sometimes Muggle contracts preclude obvioustie-ins -- the Willie  Wonka  musical didn't include the Wonka bar at its
concession stand either, did it? I am glad to settle for the golden ticketI got when winning the lottery.
BUT  HOW  WERE  THE  SEATS?  -- Oh, I knew not to expect much.
I won tickets through a lottery. A single ticket to one part cost just$20, so I paid $80 total for two seats to the entire, two-part epic.Wonderful! But surely my seats would be in the top tier behind a pole
or something? Well, my heart did sink a bit when I saw them. I had
tickets in the second level (the dress circle) in row G all the way to theside in seats 9 and 11. Only three rows remained between me and theback wall. And ALL the way to the side. This is a play, not a musical.
And even if I was seeing the tap-dance extravaganza 42nd  Street
again, I'd much rather be in the orchestra than high up. Then Iactually went to the theater and took my seats. The sight lines wereimpeccable and while Harry  Potter  has a lot of intimate, quiet scenes,
it's certainly a big show with a lot of spectacle. I would happily buy
those seats again and for more money. Frankly, I don't think any seat
in dress circle would be bad. Only a few people in the boxes and wayalong the side in row A might have missed a tiny moment of action inCelebrat...

FINE,  BUT  THE  SHOW?  HOW  WAS  THE  BLOODY  SHOW?  --
Great fun. Harry  Potter  and  the  Cursed  Child  read a little roughly for
me. (I'm not very good about reading plays or film scripts and
imagining what can be done with them.) I loved the set-up. The sons
of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy head to Hogwarts and positively
HATE it. And when they become friends, their parents positively hateTHAT. Then things get complicated. On the page, it seemed the needto get the band back together (i.e. make Harry, Ron and Hermione the
center of things) took precedence over a fresh new story. On the stage,
it more cohesive, with the stories of the parents and childrenintertwining from the start. The smartest decision they made was toevoke a classic, Victorian-style of stage craft. No video or projections
here. This show could have been staged as-is a hundred years ago. And
the movement/choreography of Steven Hoggett deservedly made thisthe rare drama to be nominated for Best Choreography. (It shouldhave won, actually.) He and director John Tiffany create real magic ina thousand little ways, alongside the rest of the crack technical team.It's a genuine treat to watch. Heck, even before the show begins, the
stage just LOOKS gorgeous. And while most of the effects are dead
simple (and doubly effective for being so), I haven't a clue how theymake the entire stage seem to waver and shimmy and shake whentime travel comes into play.
The original cast was acclaimed to high heavens and while I can't
single out anyone in the new cast, I don't see any huge weaknesses,either. They are capable and strong, even if the action by the secondhalf of part two gets tense and the show's idea of drama is for theactors to get a bit shouty. "My son is missing!" shouts one character."SO IS MINE!" shouts another. Somehow, the melodrama adds to the
fun.
And it IS fun. I haven't enjoyed an audience's reaction to a show this
much since seeing The  Lion  King.  That musical flips the audience out
right at the start with the brilliant "Circle Of Life" number, a show-stopper to end all show-stoppers. Little kids stood on their seats andlooked all around them positively wide-eyed with wonder. Heck, I didthe same thing. And at Harry  Potter  and  the  Cursed  Child?  People
(not just kids) positively gasped at various revelations. They shivered
in fear. They smiled with fondness over a shared memory voiced by
someone on stage. When one character ventured down the center aisleof the theater, virtually everyone in the dress circle craned their neckor just stood up to peer down and watch -- they were desperate not tomiss a moment. When one character walked quietly on stage for the
first time, the reaction was so visceral and shocked my guest was
beside himself with desire to ask me who it was. And that's not all. Atthe end of the first intermission and again at the end of Part One(surely the only time a stage play has ever stopped with the words "tobe continued" flashed onto the curtain) and again  at the intermission
of Part Two, the creators stage both a visual spectacle and introduce a</p>
<p>head-spinning plot twist that left the audience positively gobsmacked
and bursting with chatter.
It's a beautifully crafted production of a not-bad play, catnip for Potter
fans and fun enough to send newbies to the books to see what all thefuss is about. The stagecraft is impeccable and a joy to watch. WhileJK Rowling only worked on the story (the script is by Jack Thorne), it
shows yet again how wisely she has made use of her fame. Rather than
thinning out the pleasure of those seven books by writing more HarryPotter adventurers, Rowling uses her imagination and commercialpower to explore new worlds and new forms of storytelling. The
website Pottermore is quite innovative. The theme park rides are top-
notch. The prequel movies dubbed Fantastic  Beasts  are at least
commercially  successful and Rowling is improving as a screenwriter.
And now this stage show is a triumph that will surely be many a child'sintroduction to the pleasures of theater. All in all, that's prettymagical.
THE  CIRCLE  SERIES  AT  CIRCLE  IN  THE  SQUARE
You don't need to win the lottery to enjoy the pleasure of live theater,
even in New York City. All over the city, you'll find staged readings,semi-staged productions of little-known musicals and cabaret shows
presenting songs for a musical someone would like to make someday.
And it's all far more accessible and inexpensive than a ticket toBroadway.
Adding to the fun is Circle In The Square's recently launched Circle
Series. Throughout the summer and fall, they offer readings of newand classic works, asking only a suggested donation of $20 for adultsand $10 for seniors and students (meaning you won't be shamed if youcan only chip in say $5 or just a smile). All proceeds benefit the Circle
In The Square Theatre School, which makes sense since students and
alumni often people the casts. It's presented in partnership with thegreedily named  Pigasus Institute.
I recently attended a reading of The  Philadelphia  Story  by Philip
Barry and it was quite fun. Cocktails start at 6 pm and the readingsstarts at 7 pm. The film starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant andJimmy Stewart is an all-time favorite of mine, but the play is slightlydifferent and I'd never read it or seen it done. I think the film madesmart choices and improved on the play, so if anyone is going to stage
it again, they should start with the film script. And indeed they should
stage it again because the story works like a charm.
The Circle Series does exactly what you want it to do. It lets you enjoy
some performances for a very modest price, spot some new talent
you'll want to keep an eye on and maybe introduce you to a new
playwright of worth. Three more shows are on tap this season, withLadies  In  Waiting  by Elizabeth Canavan on tap September 9,
Bewilderness  by Zachary Fine on September 16 and Pluto  by Steve</p>
<p>Yockey on September 23. For more info, head here .
