From the Publisher: Somerset, 1911. The forces of war are building across
Europe, but this pocket of England, where the rhythms of lives are
dictated by the seasons and the land, remains untouched. Albert
Sercombe is a farmer on Lord Prideaux's estate and his eldest son, Sid, isunderkeeper to the head gamekeeper. His son, Leo, a talented rider,grows up alongside the master's spirited daughter, Charlotte--a girl who
shoots and rides, much to the surprise of the locals. In beautiful, pastoral
writing, The Horseman  tells the story of a family, a community, and the
landscape they come from. The Horseman  is a return to the world invoked
in Pears' first award-winning, extravagantly praised novel, In the Place ofFallen Leaves . It is the first book of a trilogy that will follow Leo away
from the estate and into the First World War and beyond. Exquisitely,tenderly…

What We Say
This gentle, hushed work is about life on an estate in England circa 1911. War clouds are looming but the rhythms of nature
and a world where things have always been done a certain way -- and seemingly always will -- hold sway. Our hero is theyoung lad Leo, who is a boy of few words. He studies nature the way other kids study books and above all the boy loves
horses. Leo's reserved relationship with the other servants, with his family and even his schoolteachers are almost as
interesting as Leo's relationship with the natural world around him -- the ferrets and birds and ants and sky and grass andwind and, of course, the horses. "The Horseman" is so soft a story, so lovingly intimate, so gently celebratory of everythingShare This Book

<p>from the slaughtering of a pig to a horse auction to the ritual of tending to the fields that you're almost bewitched. Pears

performance." âJane Smiley, The Washington Post Book World on IN THE PLACE OF FALLEN LEAVES
"This is it. This is the real thing. This is whatever I mean by the work of a born writer . . . . The imaginativeenergy reminds me of Dickens, constantly discovering surprising quirks and shifts and dimensions in his owninventions . . . The novel is comic, and wry, and elegiac, and shrewd and thoughtful all at once. Please read it."âA. S. Byatt, Daily Telegraph on IN THE PLACE OF FALLEN LEAVES
"The author is a gifted storyteller, steeped in country lore and the beauty of ordinary events. Like Thomas Hardy
whose kindred spirit quietly animates these pages, he is concerned with the dignity of work, the force of destiny
and the consequences of human passion." âPeter Finn, The New York Times Book Review on IN THE PLACE OF
FALLEN LEAVES
"An engaging, well-written and original novel. Pears could write about the washing up and make it interesting."âPhilip Hensher, The Guardian on IN THE PLACE OF FALLEN LEAVES
