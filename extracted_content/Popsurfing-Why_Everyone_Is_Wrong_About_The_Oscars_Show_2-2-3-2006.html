            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 3 ,  2 0 0 6Why Everyone Is Wrong About The Oscars Show#2The second myth about this year's Oscar show: People don't care aboutthe movies because they haven't seen them. Actually, this is a great yearfor audiences to get interested in the Oscars because three of themovies are still peaking at the box office. As I reported below,Brokeback is expanding to 2000 screens this weekend, Capote is goingto 1200 screens, Good Night and Good Luck is expanding to almost1000 and of course Crash is already available on DVD. Many times, themovies nominated for Best Picture are already played out or have littleor no steam left at the box office. That's clearly not the case this year.Four of the five pictures clearly can gain a lot from their nods. (Rentingand buying DVDs is as significant as going to the movies, so Crashcounts too.) This year, Oscar is right in tune with the critics andproving a great marketing tool to encourage people to go to the movies.And isn't that the point of the Oscars?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
