!)zTeen idol talks about near-fatal crash
By MIGHAEI GIITZ
[lrake Bell - the talented
I I star of Nickelodeon's hit
E series'Drake &fosh" -
is back at work after a vear-
end car crash that fraclured
his neck, knocked out six
teeih, and left fans wondering
if he'd ever be able to perform
agaln.
The other driver was ar
fault, hitting Bell when he was
stopped at a light. But that
hasn't made him feel anv
better about what happened.
"In the beginning, I was like,
this is no big deal," says the 19-
year-old actor. "My mouth is
wired shut, but I can live with
this. And then, dude, like three
or four weeks into it, I was
like,'This is ridiculous. I still
have five weeks to go. Oh, my
God. How am I goine to do
this?'
"The day they unwired me
was the hardest. I couldn,t
open my mouth at all. I
opened it like half an inch. andI saw stars; I was dizzv. You're
clenching your jaw for two
and a half months straight."
A teen idol pinup, Bell
candidly admits he was
worried about his looks.
More important to the
young singer-actor - who
wrote his show's theme song
and just released his
promising debut CD,
"Telegraph" - was what
might happen to his voice.
"I was so scared," savs Bell.
"I didn't know what I was
going to look like. I didn't
know if I was going to be able
to sing again or talk normally. I
have fake teeth and it affects
my speech. I have to learn how
to say my s's and my t's over
again. It's tough."
He took comfort in not
being able to shave -
suddenly Bell was sporting
what he-proudly calied a'frrtt-
on Paul McCartney" beard that
must have shocked some of his
preteen fans.
"I'm singing again," says
Bell, whose only visible result
of the crash is a tiny scar
across his chin that fans seem
to love."My jaw pops and
cracks and stuff. The
doctor says that'llgo
away; you've just got to
give it time:"
The good news is that he
The series won Best Show,
and Bell won Best Actor at
Nickelodeon's hieh-profiie
Kids Choice Awaidihst
month ("I did NOT
expect that," says
Bell) and Bell is
soon going to direct
an episode.
He appreciates all
the. opportunities
he has, but he
doesn't hlpe up
any sort ot
revelations that
his brush with
death might have
provided.
"I didn't turn
into Cat Stevens
or anything," he
jokes.</p>
