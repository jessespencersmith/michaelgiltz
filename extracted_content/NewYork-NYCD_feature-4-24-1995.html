            <p>Used-CD Store 
There's a strip of stores along St. Marks 
Place between Second and Third Avenues 
that dominates the used-CD market-it 
includes such stalwarts as Sounds, Smash 
Compact Discs, Venus Records, and 
Joe's Compact Discs. Even more stores 
are now setting up shop on the 
surrounding blocks, so it seems like 
the last place in the world someone 
would want to open yet another 
place. Twenty-five-year-old Tony 
Sachs, a former employee of Smash, 
was the first to figure that out. He has 
had the Upper West Side virtually to 
himself since opening NYCD (426 
Amsterdam Ave., near 80th St.; 724-
4466) a year and a hair ago. Like the 
downtown stores, his is crammed with 
used CDs ranging rrom recent releases 
to obscure jazz classics, as well as a 
healthy selection of new CDs, boxed 
sets, and imports.</p>
