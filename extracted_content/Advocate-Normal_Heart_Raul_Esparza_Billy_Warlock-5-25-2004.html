I s 
Larry Kramer's classic 
AIDS play The Normal Heart, 
revived in New York 20 years 
to the day after its opening, 
still cuts deep, A talk with 
leading men Raul Esparza 
and Billy Warlock 
By Michael Giltz 
s The ·orm at HeaTt-Larry Kra­
mer's dramal;pp ~d from the h ad­
lines (or, mol' accurately ripped 
from what should hav be n the 
headHnes)-dated? AU greaT plays 
are universal, but is The Normal Heart 
now a period piece? 
We'll have to wait another 50 or 100 
years before that question can be an­
swered because the current revival at 
the Public Theater in New York City-opening on April 21, 20 years to the 
day and in the very same space where 
it debuted-makes abundantl y clear 
that The Normal HeaTt is still painful­
ly relevant. 
The AIDS crisis growing ever more 
deadly? A complacent public and a 
downright antagonistic government? 
Gay marriage and a passionate debate 
over whether gay identity is wrapped 
up in sex or something more? Younger 
THE ADVOCATE I. I MAY 25. 2004 theatergoers might be forgiven for 
thinking Kramer wrote this play today, 
except for one thing: Its passion is still 
singular and rare. 
"When I read it, it made me very 
angry. It still has that visceral wallop," 
says Raul Esparza, who plays Kra­
mer's stand-in, Ned Weeks, and who 
has also shone in such Broadway 
shows as Taboo, Cabaret, and Tick, 
Tick ... Boom!</p>

I "When we did the first reading 
in this space I couldn't stop cry­
ing," says Esparza. "It gives you 
chills. There are so many things 
the audience will pick up that the 
characters don't realize. It is 
heavy with dramatic irony right 
now, every time you mention gay 
marriage. He keeps saying, 'Why 
didn't you fight for this?'" 
For Billy Warlock-of Bay­
watch and General Hospital 
fame-the role of Ned's lover, 
Felix, is a chance to fight for 
broader opportunities as an actor. 
"I'm a really simple guy," says 
Warlock, who walked away from 
General Hospital without any 
roles locked in. Eighteen days 
later he read for this play, left for 
New York, got an apartment, and 
started to prepare for his New 
York theatrical debut. 
"This play takes up every bit 
of focus I have," Warlock says. 
"It really does. When I really 
stop and think about what we're 
getting ready to do, it's an over­
whelming thing for a guy that's 
used to film and TV. This is a 
whole other animal." 
Warlock is perhaps an instinc­
tual actor, while Esparza is a 
very verbal and intellectual one. 
(He's so well-versed on gay is­
sues that Esparza deserves to be 
an honorary homo, though he 
has been married to a woman 
since 1994.) But both he and 
Warlock describe Kramer as an 
intimidating presence. 
"He's intense," laughs Warlock. 
"When he looks and talks to 
you .. .it's weight. He's the last guy 
I would ever want to piss off. n 
Esparza agrees. 
"He's a very difficult man," says 
Esparza admiringly. "He pushes 
you. I've really fallen for him, I 
have to tell you. His integrity is extraor­
dinary. I don't think anybody could live 
that burningly honest all the time. I've 
been asked by great people that I ad­
mire, 'How many men do you know 
that have changed the world?' And he's 
one of them." •
