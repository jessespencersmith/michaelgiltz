            <p>r omedian Rhona Cameron 
stole bottles of champagne 
in Scotland ("Until I was 
caught," she adds) and sold 
dodgy paintings door-to­
door Down Under. (She'd 
followed a particularly ap­
pealing woman to Australia .) Now she 
wants to make a go of her first BBC sit­
com, Rlwna. Instead of police or skepti­
cal art buyers, now all Cameron has to 
deal with are reporters who keep calling 
her show the British EUen. 
"It's not a lesbian sitcom," she says 
gamely, which is just as true as saying 
Friends is not a straight one. It is a 
show about Rhona, a video reviewer for 
a tiny London-based magazine, who 
wants to make movies. "My character 
is on a quest for happiness that she 
thinks she can get through manipula­
tion, which goes completely wrong," 
explains Cameron . "She's like George 
on Seirl/eld. " 
Right down to its charming ly dorky 
theme song, which she cowrote and 
sings, Rhona is a childhood fantasy 
come true for the 34-year-o ld comic, 
who grew up loving the "loose and fast 
and real" humor of America's Rhoda. 
"I have to admit, I always wanted to 
be on TV and have my name on things," 
says Cameron, chatting at a cafe in Lon­
don after a whirlwind of press to pro­
mote the shows late-July launch. "But I 
didn't really start seriously thinking 
about this show or working on it until 
three years ago, when we started pitch­
ing the idea I just thought it was a natur­
al progression for me. I asked an ex-girl­
friend of mine who's been my friend for 
about 16 years to write the sitcom with 
me because we've shared sort of the 
same life and the same humor." 
As with many comics, Cameron's 
early life didn't provide a lot of laughs 
while she was living it British by birth, 
she was adopted by Scottish parents and 
raised in Edinburgh. Even though she 
had a perfectly nice boyfriend at the 
time, she lost her virginity to an older 
man living next door who kept pestering 
her. "I don't know why I didn't do it with 
[the boyfriend] , though I did do it with 
him later," she says. And the sex? "It was ... nice. Like getting a foot massage. 
But I dumped him at 16 for this de­
ranged girl that I had fantastic sex with 
all the time. " 
Cameron is quick to disabuse anyone 
of the idea that she had a happy, randy, 
angst-free childhood . "Oh, no, no, no-­
terrible angst," she exclaims. "Oh, God! 
Angst! I lived in a small Scottish fishing 
town, and when I hit puberty I was very 
badly bullied until my father died, and 
then I think people felt sorry for me. But 
I had a really bad time. I was spat on 
and beat up, and my back was drawn on 
in chalk. 
"My mom was really rubbish when I fi­
nally [came out]," says Cameron. (Ameri­
can translation: Mom was no help at all.) 
"Then we went through three years of 
hell, and all of a sudden it became OK 
again. But I had strong feelings around 
about the age of 13 that I must try and not 
be gay. I used to write in my diary, 'I will 
not be queer. I will like David. '" 
She laughs at the memory. "I have to 
say, I was so driven. My sexual desire 
was so strong, it pretty much dominated 
most of my childhood-apart from 
other nice things like death and loss and 
abandonment. When I wasn't dwelling 
on those three things, I was dwelling on 
my constant sexual frustration about 
women." 
That led to her pursuit of the woman 
Down Under, which ultimately led her to 
London, where Cameron talked her way 
into a role for a "really bad women's co­
op feminist film." The movie was noth­
ing, but a woman she befriended on it 
told Cameron to try out stand-up. 
Now she's gone on to host or appear 
on countless TV shows, most notably 
four seasons hosting Gay time TV, a 
fluffy chat show that gave her a chance 
to interview everyone from k.d. lang 
("She didn't even notice me") to Martina 
Navratilova ("Now, we had a really good 
rapport"). It's also given her a chance to 
see how quickly and easily gay and les­
bian celebrities--who've always seemed 
more open in the United Kingdom than 
in the United States-can push the 
boundaries of what's acceptable. In 
other words, Gay time TV soon went 
from groundbreaking to old hat television

"Gay time IV got mostly parmed," ex­
plains Cameron . "It was on BBC2 for 
four years, and the idea was an enter­
tainment program for gay people, just as 
normal and regular as can be. There'd 
been an earlier show that was more agit­
prop, and they wanted this to be light 
and fluffy, like daytime television." 
The mix made for some awkward 
juxtapositions. "On the one hand, you'd 
talk about Take That splitting up, and 
then you'd talk about gay funerals. 
You'd talk to someone about dying of 
AIDS, and then you'd switch to gay bath 
towels. But other programs came on, 
like Queer as Folk, that took it so much 
further-where being gay was just mat­
ter-of-fact-that people felt Gay time 
was a bit dated." 
Now Cameron hopes to change the 
rules again by starring in a funny sitcom 
that, like Will & Grace in the United 
States, just happens to be about a gay 
character. 
"In one episode called 'Birthday Girl,' I 
start dating a really beautiful middle­
class solicitor with glasses. I've gone off 
her, but I'm keeping her for my birthday. 
I've speeded up the intimacy too quickly, 
but I've got to keep her for my birthday 
because she looks good for me. There's a 
line in it where I say, 'Just because I'm a 
lesbian I don't have to be deep.' " 
What is deep, however, is Cameron 's 
amazement at her own success. She's 
been in a relationship for about a year 
with a woman she wants to spend the 
rest of her life with. Her TV show is air­
ing on the BBC. And now she's looking 
to tackle her favorite love: movies. 
"It seems ridiculous to me because 
everything I've ever wanted is happen­
ing," she says. "If I can go from nothing 
to doing stand-up and then getting a sit­
com with my name on it, why shouldn't I 
be able to write and direct a film? It's in­
credible. Sometimes I have three or four 
days without feeling despair." •
