Spectacular Freshens Up
RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR  ** 1/2
out of ****
RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL
The Radio City Christmas Spectacular  is an annual
tradition, so it's always a balancing act to include the
elements that must remain with new routines. Thisyear's edition was conceived, directed andchoreographed by Linda Halberman and it feels
freshened up quite nicely to eyes that haven't seen this
event in years, well before Halberman revamped itsubstantially in 2007.
They waste no time in getting the Rockettes out front
and center, high kicking it with their usual precision. The opening number includes the dancers in
reindeer outfits complete with antlers that light up, cute enough though it's a shame to have those great
legs covered even for just one routine.
The first of two 3-D shorts -- "Santa Flies To New York" -- follows. The animation here is rudimentary for
any kid used to Pixar and the like, but the 3-D effects do a good job of having Santa's sleigh and presentsand the like float out over the crowd.
"The Twelve Days Of Christmas" is happily presented as a dance number so you needn't hear most of the
lyrics until close to the finale. However, it has an odd arrangement for the first few verses that is almost

<p>dirge-like, though the orchestrations perk up by the time we get to "five gold rings" and is brighter after
that.
Two perennials follow, with the stuffed toys and a little girl doing "The Nutcracker" followed by "The
Parade Of The Wooden Soldiers." It's easy to just glide by these pieces but they're key to the show."Wooden Soldiers" in particular is a pleasure. They feature the precision dancing of the Rockettes, who
work hard at making this seem easy for the four or five shows a day they perform. The choreography even
adds in a soldier in the back scurrying into place to give the automaton nature of the piece a humantouch so you can appreciate all the more what they're doing.
A bus tour of New York City for the Rockettes follows, with people ice skating and the like on display. The
choreography fades a bit here; surely more could be done with the Rockettes on a tour bus than we see.
Or perhaps I was distracted by the constant stream of product placements which began during Santa's 3-
D ride and proved overwhelming here, from New York Life and Madison Square Gardens to seeing aChase bank on seemingly every street corner. (Come to think of it, maybe that's just done for the sake ofrealism.)
A modest storyline is introduced with a mother frantic to find a "Jumping Jasmine" doll for her daughter.
Santa (a solid Charles Edward Hall) knows what they really need is quality time and whisks the two off to
the North Pole. This set piece is busy and confusing with no real focus as mother and daughter help the
elves load presents for the big holiday. The costumes and choreography and busy set get in the way ofeach other here.
This is unfortunately followed by the show's newest attraction and its low-point: "Santa's Video Game."
Instead of say, baking cookies or doing some charity work or caroling or some other low-tech enterprise,
Santa gets the two to play a video game. OK, that's sharing time with your kid, so it's not such a bad idea.
But few things are as dull as watching other people play a video game. This one involves rescuingpresents from the castle of the Humbugs, not that you'd care. The animation is more detailed andconvincing than in the first short, but creatively it's a flop. In a deadly dull segment, we don 3-D glasses
and watch the two work their way up level after level. Because the game presumably features the
Rockettes battling the Humbugs, they're placed onstage between the players and the screen. That meansthat the 3-D is downplayed so as not to spoil the effect of thinking the Rockettes are actually in the video
game. But of course that makes you wonder why the heck you're wearing the 3-D glasses in the first
place. Plus, the desired effect of making it look like the Rockettes have entered the game a la Tron  simply
doesn't come off in the least, not that the segment would be improved creatively if it had. Then themother steps aside to sing a patented generic holiday tune called "Closer Than You Know/I Knew." In all,
this probably takes 10 minutes; it stalls the energy of the show -- though not fatally -- and really should be
removed as soon as possible.
Happily, things barrel towards the climax with a big sing-along celebrating the holiday followed by "The
Living Nativity" framed as the mother reading the Gospel story to her daughter, which makes it feel

<p>much more intimate and natural than the booming voice of God intro of the Nativity I remember from
years ago. A clap-along for "Joy To The World" follows and we're done.
Overall, this edition was polished and more entertaining than my last visit and the perennials are
presented with care. The Rockettes and their costumes look as fresh and precise as ever; those dancers
must be exhausted by the time January rolls around but you'd never know it. Families will undoubtedlybe pleased. It's a mystery why a show like this with its large budget can't find some original holiday songsworthy of it. Perhaps they've introduced some such number in the past, but every new tune presented
here feels written by committee, though Mark Waldrop is given sole credit for the original tunes. Happily,
the vast majority performed in the show are holiday standards.
A live theatrical experience doesn't need gizmos like 3-D. That's precisely the sort of thing a $200 million
movie will always be able to do better than a stage show like this. But what a stage show can offer is the
live experience. Much of the demanding dance routines means they must de-emphasize live singing, but
sticking to traditionals and giving a little more emphasis to a showcased singer or two at key points
would place the focus precisely on what a show like this can deliver that TV and movies can't. Attempts to
be contemporary and hip are always misplaced -- God help me, I still remember the horrors of a rapping
Santa from my last visit. When the Rockettes are front and center, dancing with precision, no special 3-D
glasses are needed to enjoy yourself.
