8/19/2005 11:41:00 PMWhat do we know about Supreme Court nominee JohnRoberts? Based on the records we do have, his vision ofAmerica is this:ID cards for all citizens at all timesVoting rights -- you're on your own; good luckWomen's rights -- what discrimination? (Roberts should talkto Justice O'Connor and learn her dramatic life story beforeblithely dismissing the idea that women suffer discrimination.)10 Commandments -- his version gets posted all over theplace; what's the big deal?School prayer -- of course. As long as you pray to his god andin his way. (Buddhists and atheists and agnostics and peoplewho think parents should be teaching their kids how to pray --not the gym coach -- can take a hike.)Find other examples of how Roberts wants to shape thiscountry from his public record and we'll add it here.
