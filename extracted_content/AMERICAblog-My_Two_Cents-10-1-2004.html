10/01/2004 05:01:00 AMOkay, most everyone has gone to bed so I'll throw in my slightlyoff-message comments. I was at a Yankee game and came home atmidnight so I had the typically surreal experience of watching thedebates, discussing it with a friend and then absorbing thepost-debate coverage on ABC, CNN, MSNBC, FOX and elsewhere. Asoften happens when you isolate yourself, my reaction to the debatewas quite different....But don't stop cheering Kerry. We're winning the post-debate spinand that's what really matters. ABC News was all pro Kerry onsubstance and style, (though Nightline had really lame guests andseemed to be more wishy-washy about who'd won). Everyonedescribed the Kerry camp as jubilant and the Bush camp asdefensive. Jon Stewart (duh), Chris Matthews, Larry King all werequoting poll after poll showing Kerry had come out best, lookedpresidential and had the big Mo (momentum) in his favor. Great!Personally, however, I was disappointed though not disheartened byKerry's performance. He held his own -- as John so astutely predictedit was all he needed to do -- but I thought Bush was so weak thatKerry could have skewered him even more.Bush, of course, was bad. He looked like Alfred E. Neuman of Madmagazine, sounded petulant, gulped down water, struck his fist onthe podium in a very annoying way, and -- though few havementioned it in the general media -- he had NUMEROUS deer in theheadlight moments where he couldn't think of what to say, lost histrain of thought, got confused, and so on. All par for the course forBush, naturally.But he gave so many openings that Kerry didn't exploit. I cackledwith glee at times when Bush said stuff and then was disappointedKerry didn't dive in. My main complaint is that Kerry spent too muchtime on the issues, too much time defining himself instead of goingafter Bush. This election is about Bush and the (terrible) job he'sdone. Kerry should pound away at the mistakes of Bush, not wastetime define himself ("I was not misleading..." Oy!) or explaining whathe'd do. Just show again and again how Bush has made a mess ofthings.Part Two Below
