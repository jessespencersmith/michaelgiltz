7/05/2005 01:45:00 PMA fine, sensitive article in the New York Times detailing the endof life decisions surrounding a woman in the Bronx. This veryscenario -- family members coming together with doctors andbioethicists to decide her treatment -- takes place every day allover the country, long before and long after the circussurrounding Terri Schiavo.In this case, the doctors convince the husband to take somesteps before removing her ventilator, the woman recoversenough to make her own decisions and makes absolutely clearshe does not want to be kept artificially alive on a ventilator ifher breathing becomes labored again. It does, she is givenmorphine to ease the pain and quietly dies.Just as the fanatics who circled Terri Schiavo like vultures hadno interest in whatever Terri might have wanted, they wouldnever want this woman to be able to make her own end-of-lifedecisions. They would insist that she HAD to be kept on aventilator, even though the woman herself expressly refused it.The fanatics do not want to help people make their owndecisions, they want to take those decisions out of your hand.Why aren't the fanatics picketing every hospital and hospice inthis country in the wake of Terri Schiavo? Because they knowthe vast majority of Americans disagree with them and thinktheir fanaticism is misguided and wrong. Even so, no one wantsto keep them from controlling their own end-of-life decisions; ifthey want to spend decades as a vegetable hooked up tomachines, no one else cares. But if their real goal -- to forceeveryone else to do the same -- was made clear, the fanaticsknow America would reject them.
