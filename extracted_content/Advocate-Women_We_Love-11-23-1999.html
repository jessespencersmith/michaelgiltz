            <p>SUSAN SARANDON IS TIIE BIG SISTER 
you'd come out to first, and you lmow 
she'd kick the ass of anyone who gave you 
a hard time about it. The feelings of admi­susan 
SARANDON 
ration are mutual. "I appreciate and gravitate toward gay men and 
women," Sarandon tells us. "As a woman I realize the struggle they 
have had and that they face the same enemy: the establishment. And 
I've learned from them humor in the face of adversity and pride in 
being different." It's just that mix of in-your-face strength and sly 
subversiveness that makes the wild, warm-eyed star so appealing. 
And she backs words with actio n. "My early involvem ent with AIDS 
came directly from the loss of a dear friend who felt the need to hide 
his illness from everyone," says Sarandon, who soon appears in her 
partner Tim Robbins's gay-tinged Cradle Will Rock and is developing 
a TV movie based on the story of gay rights activist-mother Mary 
Griffith. "This gave me no choice but to speak out."</p>

ALBRIGHT 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT IS THE FIRST FEMALE 
u.S. secretary of state, and as Congressman Bar­
ney Frank points out, trailblazers strike a chord 
with gay men. "She puts a serious dent in some of 
the stereotypes that have been used to put road­
blocks in women's way," Frank says. Any time an­
other minority gets ahead and gets the job done in 
a unique and telling way, we all benefit. Her ap­
pearance on this list alone helps negate the stereo­
type that gay men only care about Audrey Hep­
burn movies and Madonna

DOLE 
SAYING EUZABETH DOLE'S SEEMINGLY lllGH 
VOTE of confidence an10ng our male readers is a sw'­
prise is an tmderstatement as grand as a certain canyon 
in Arizona True, before she dropped out of the presiden­
tial race in October, she had made polite noises about 
gay support, going so far as to say she wouldn't disquali­
fy someone for a post simply because he was gay. Still, 
that's a far cry from being proactive on gay issues. Per­
haps the things that endear Dole to some gay men are 
her talk show-host ability to chrum a crowd and her 
calm approach to a husband who 
shares his sexual impotence prob­
lems with the world. Rich Tafel, 
executive director of the gay 
group Log Cabin Republicans, 
says he thinks Dole's crunpaign 
shut down "because she doesn't 
have a message," but he adds, 
"She's a strong figure, and a lot of 
people respect that. " elizabeth 
TAYLOR 
WHO WOULDN'T WANT to be­
friend the woman who befriended 
Jan1es Dean, Rock Hudson, and 
Montgom ery Clift? "And Michael 
Jackson!" laughs playwright and 
screenwriter Paul Rudnick. Jack­
son may be straight, but the 
writer notes that the eternal diva 
has "befriended every gay male 
person in history." Larger-than­
life doesn't begin to describe her 
appeal. She's unlucky in love but 
ever hopeful. She's still one of the 
most beautiful women in the 
world. She has starred in film 
classics (Who's Afraid oj Vir­
ginia Wooif?) and notorious 
boondoggles (Cleopatra). And, of 
course, she's a hero. "She took 
great risks early on by linking her­
self to the AIDS crisis," notes pro­
ducer Baf1J' Krost. Other celebri­
ties are just following her lead. 
And we'd follow her anywhere.</p>
<p>THINK OF THE ODDS. Oprah Winfrey may be a one-per-Oillrah WHOOPI GOLDBERG WHIPPED 
INTO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS 
playing a lady-lover in The Color 
Purple. But the shy role she 
played to perfection in Steven 
Spielberg's drama is a far cry from 
the truth-telling, dirt-dishing atti­
tude of Goldberg the woman. How 
appropriate then that she has now 
found success on-<>f all places-­
her self-produced game show. 
"Anyone who could make Holly­
wood Squares not square has a 
will of steel and a lot of chits to 
call in," notes Scott Seomin, enter­
tainment media director for the 
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation , which bestowed a 
wildly eloquent Goldberg with the 
Vanguard Award at the GLAAD 
Media Awards in April. "She was 
gay-friendly before it was trendy." 
Besides, replacing fey Paul Lynde 
in the center square adds immea­
sW"ably to her cachet anl0ng gays. 
son conglomerate today, but early on she was a down-to- .t--<. 
earth black woman trying to make it on the whiter-than- WIN F HEY 
white talk tun. These days while Springer et al. exploit 
their guests for freak appeal, we trust Winfrey to tell oW" stories with respect-as she did 
when she warmly hosted Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche on her show soon after they 
announced their love. Gay men have reason to feel at home with Oprah too. "I've never 
been able to put my finger on why gay men identify so strongly with black women who 
overcome hardship ," says Rich Tafel, executive director of the gay group Log Cabin 
Republicans. "But we do. Oprah's not a victim. She's taken control of her life. And my 
sense is that for her, the gay issue is a nonissue. The way she treats her gay guests, she 
normalizes it-unlike so many of the other talk shows." Winfrey, who is bringing her 
brand of enlightenment to the magazine world next year, continues to rewrite the rules.
