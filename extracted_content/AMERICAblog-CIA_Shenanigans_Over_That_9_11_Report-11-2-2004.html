11/02/2004 07:47:00 PMBush's politicized choice for the C.I.A. -- Porter Goss - is already hardat work doing a terrible job. (Hey, he's only got a few weeks to getthings down, so who can blame him? :))The C.I.A.'s director general was ordered by Congress to deliver areport about the C.I.A.'s performance surrounding 9-11 andspecifically to determine who if anyone should be held accountable forits gross errors. The Bush people aren't too fond of accountability sono wonder Goss has objected -- he wants them to get rid of thesection that names names and actually puts people's foot to the firewho let this president and this country down with their shoddyperformance."The draft report was completed in July, but it has not yet beenshared with the individuals named in the document. That step hasbeen delayed for the last 90 days to allow time for Mr. Goss, who tookoffice in September, and his predecessor, John E. McLaughlin, toreview the document. In recent weeks, members of Congress, bothDemocrats and Republicans, have complained to Mr. Goss about thedelay. The disclosure of the request from Mr. Goss represents the firstindication of how he intends to approach the issue," reports the NewYork Times."An intelligence official said that Mr. Goss had requested only that Mr.Helgerson "consider" making changes in the "formatting andpresentation" of the draft report as he believed appropriate."Ultimately, it is the call of I.G. to decide how to proceed,'' theintelligence official said."Congressional officials critical of Mr. Goss's request said they saw itas inconsistent with Congress's intent that the inspector general, notan internal board, determine who, if anyone, should be heldresponsible for errors related to the Sept. 11 attacks. Among theactions highlighted in previous inquiries by Congress and anindependent commission have been the failure of C.I.A. and F.B.I.personnel to share information in summer 2001 that should have putsome of the hijackers on a government watch list."
