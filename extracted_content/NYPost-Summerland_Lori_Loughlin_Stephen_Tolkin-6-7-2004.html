            <p>One hot, sizzlin 
WB hit a smart move for 'Full House' star 
By MICHAEL GILTZ Ghlo1 
THE summer has its first hit. 
The new drama "Summer­
land," which began last week, 
was the highest-rated debut in two 
years for the WB. 
And the only reason the show ex­
ists is because star Lori Loughlin, 
the star of the early '90s hit "Full 
House," didn't want to look dumb. 
The story goes like this: 
When the WB called to set up a 
meeting, Lori knew one of the first 
questions would be whether she 
had any ideas for a series. 
"I didn't want to say no; I did it 
out of not wanting to look dumb," 
laughs Loughlin, who suddenly 
looks very smart. 
She plays Ava Gregory, a fashion 
designer who quits her job and sud­
denly finds herself saddled with 
three kids after her sister and 
brother-in-law die in an accident. 
"I was in Hawaii on a family 
vacation when my agent called 
me about the meeting," says 
the 39-year-old actress, who is 
married to fashion designer 
Mossimo Giannulli. "I hung up 
the phone and walked out on 
the beach. I might have had a 
cocktail; I can't remember. I 
thought, 'What can I do?' 
"I didn't want to be the mom ... 
And then I thought of this 
woman who -boom! -one day 
her life changes on a dime. I 
wrote it out in longhand and 
my son, who is 12 [her hus­
band's child from a previous 
marriage], typed it up on the 
computer. 
"He got to name the three 
kids. I said, 'Give me a cool 
name for a boy.' And he 
said, 'I think Bradin's a cool 
name.' So that's pretty cool; 
he got to name all the kids 
on this show." 
No one was more sur­
prised than Loughlin when 
the executives said they 
loved it and asked her to 
meet with Aaron Spelling. 
That led to Stephen Tol­
kin, a Spelling protege who writes and is an executive producer on the 
show. He made his own contribution to the 
name game. 
"I met with Lori at the Polo Lounge and 
said, 'You know, Ava Gardner probably sat 
at this table,' " says Tolkin. "And we said, 
'Ava!' And that's how we named her char­
acter." 
With teenagers in lust and an oceanfront 
setting, comparisons to "The O.C.," Fox's 
summer hit from last season, are inevita­
ble. 
" 'The O.C.' is my favorite show," says 
Tolkin. "I'm addicted to it. But this show, I 
wrote the entire pilot before I ever saw it." 
Besides, "The O.c." is a classic soap, says 
Tolkin. "Summerland" is more a family 
drama. And with a lot more surfing. 
In the show, 16-year-old Bradin (played 
by 16-year-old Jesse McCartney) takes 
up surfing and develops an immediate 
crush on his instructor, Erica (Tay­
lor Cole). 
"Basically, on 'The O.C.,' Peter 
Gallagher walks in with wet 
hair and a surtboard,"laughs 
Tolkin, brother of screen­
writer Michael Tolkin 
("The Player") and son of 
a head writer on "Your 
Show of Shows." 
"We're really going to 
use the beach." 
One review put 
the series down as 
"Full Beach 
House." 
But the only re­
views that matter 
-the ratings -
have been terrific. 
In New York and 
Atlanta, in fact, "Sum­
merland" beat every 
other network. ~ 
Loughlin got waves of 
congratulatory phone calls, 
and Tolkin said his mother-in­
law even heard people talking about 
it at the opera. 
Apparently, the WB knew what it was 
doing by launching their best shot at a 
breakout hit in the first weeks of sum­
mer. 
"This show was meant to be shown in 
the summer," says Tolkin. "It screams 
summer. 
It's called 'Summerland' after all."</p>
