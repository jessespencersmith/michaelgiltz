8/18/2005 04:10:00 PMBrother Roger, a 90 year old monk who founded a communitywhere Christians of all denominations and indeed any people offaith were respected and welcomed was brutally murdered byan apparently mad woman. A tragic loss -- Brother Roger wasfamous among Christians the world over, at least those whothought they should admire and honor the religious paths ofother people, those who emphasized love and compassioninstead of punishment and fear.But his brutal slaying is somehow appropriate, somehowindicative of the world today, where intolerance and hatred isheld as the highest ideal by the fundamentalists in so manyreligions, from many in my Catholic Church to the Protestantsin America to the Episcopalians in Africa and Asia to theMuslims in the Middle East.Brother Roger had little in common with people who denouncedand belittled and put down others. Heck, the New Yorkerdetails how even Billy Graham is seen as an apostate byfundamentalist Christians for reaching out to others with love(his son Franklin is a lot more intolerant and so a lot more totheir liking). Yes, Brother Roger was too kind and loving fortheir taste. So, I believe, was Jesus.
