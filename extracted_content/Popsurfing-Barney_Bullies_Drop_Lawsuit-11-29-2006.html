            <p>Newer PostOlder PostW E D N E S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 9 ,  2 0 0 6Barney Bullies Drop LawsuitThis is a huge victory: a guy posted a clear parody of the purpledinosaur Barney that didn't harm a soul. But the people behind themultimillion dollar creation tried to push the guy into taking down hiswebsite, despite the fact that it was a clear example of fair use. Bigmoney expected to triumph but the guy fought back with the help of theElectronic Frontier Foundation and the suit was just dropped. Just ashort time ago, Americablog was sent a threatening letter for posting aclip from CNN in which Bill Maher mentioned that everyone in DCknew Ken Mehlman was gay. CNN cut the clip from its reairing of theLarry King talk show, edited the transcript and tried to force everyoneonline to stop airing the clip, even though it was clearly news and a 10second clip of the actual soundbite is unquestionably a case of fair use.This is going to come up again and again and again over the next fewyears. The only way this story could be better was if it went to trial anda precedent was set. I hope the guy countersues for harrassment anddamages -- the Barney people assumed they could just threaten to sueand force him to do end a practice they knew was perfectly legal. Theyshould be punished for using lawsuits to circumvent the law.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
