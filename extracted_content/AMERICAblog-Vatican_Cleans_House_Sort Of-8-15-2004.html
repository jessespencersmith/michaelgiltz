8/15/2004 03:26:00 PMThat seminary in Austria that was accused of widespread sexualmisconduct, harboring computers with more than 40,000pornographic images and videos (including shots of little boys,beastiality and violent sexual scenarios) has finally been shut down ayear after the scandal first broke.But Bishop Kung -- who dismissed all this as "boyish pranks" -- is stillin power and Bishop Kreen (a far right conservative) only shut theseminary down after resisting as long as possible. In classic "it wasonly a few soldiers" mode, Kreen blamed it all on a few seminarians.
