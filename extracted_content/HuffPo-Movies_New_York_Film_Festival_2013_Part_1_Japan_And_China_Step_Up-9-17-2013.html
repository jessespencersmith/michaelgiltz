#1  --  Japan  And  China  Step  Up
LIKE  FATHER  LIKE  SON  *** out of ****
A  TOUCH  OF  SIN  ** 1/2 out of ****
The New York Film Festival  opens on September 27 with a screening of the Tom Hanks
Oscar-hopeful Captain  Phillips.  But for the press it starts now with early morning
screenings most every day for the next three weeks. As usual, the NYFF has cherry picked
some of the most acclaimed movies that have debuted at other festivals around the world,as well as supporting longtime favorites. Several major Oscar contenders -- like theaforementioned Captain  Phillips,  the folk music film Inside  Llewyn  Davis  and the
acclaimed 12  Years  A  Slave  -- are all eagerly waited.
Film buffs will also savor the art house hopefuls that may never gain a huge wide audiencebut hope to attain the even more enduring trait of greatness. Then there's Blue  Is  TheWarmest  Color,  the top prize winner at Cannes which may do a little bit of both. The
festival is filled with some dauntingly long fare -- a four hour miniseries about the PragueSpring, a four hour+ take on Crime  and  Punishment,  a four hour look at Berkeley and
how a university is run and a relatively brisk three hour and 38 minute film by ClaudeLanzmann on two key figures in the Holocaust. I'm looking forward to them -- I just wishthey didn't sometimes start the screenings at 9 am! If you read that list and get excitedlike I do, then NYFF is for you. Here are my impressions of the first two films I saw.
LIKE  FATHER  LIKE  SON  *** out of ****
Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda has been a favorite of mine since I caught Nobody
Knows  at Cannes in 2004. (Hey, I spent a lot of money going to the Cannes Film Festival
for more than a decade; I'm going to milk that for all its worth.) Other films like AfterLife,  I  Wish and Still  Walking  contribute to an impressive body of work. So does his new
movie which is typically quiet, observant and filled with some excellent performances fromchild actors.
The story is cliched, really. A wealthy couple with a six year old boy is seen going about
their daily lives. The father Nonomiya (Masaharu Fukuyama) is a driven, very successfulbusinessman who expects no less from his child. Classical piano lessons are never to beshirked; if the father can take a little time off from work on Sunday, it's a special treat.Their apartment feels more like a hotel room than a home. But make no mistake. Hisfocus on hard work is well meant and mother Midori (Ono Machiko) is there for a warmertouch. Their lives are deftly established and then upended when hospital officials call tosay their son was switched at birth with another little boy.

<p>The results are perhaps predictable. Their biological son is living with a family that is
relatively poor but boisterous and happy. Hospital officials say in cases like this thechildren are virtually always switched back but the families hesitate. They circle eachother, trade the boys for weekend sleepovers, grapple with new ways of raising kids (ourprotagonists are horrified when their son comes back with a very minor scrape from aplayground) and so on. Will Nonomiya in particular become a better father with thissecond chance? Does he love his son only because his son is his blood or because they've
shared a life together for six years? Will they raise both boys? Or will the other family?
I might have mapped out these changes myself, but Koreeda keeps it fresh by staying
observant and quiet, letting the drama of what's going on unfold naturally. The cast issuitably restrained despite the high melodrama taking place. You wrestle with natureversus nurture and what it means to be a parent while watching this movie -- familiar
stuff all. But it's to the film's credit that I was genuinely unsure of what would happen.
And the familiar aspects (such as Nonomiya loosening up) weren't overdone. Not his best
but another solid film for Koreeda.
A  TOUCH  OF  SIN  ** 1/2 out of ****
Zhangke Jia is another major talent, one of the most important and bold figures in
Chinese cinema. His masterpiece is Platform , but he's also delivered unconventional films
like The  World  and a distinctive documentary about Shanghai called I  Wish  I  Knew  that I
loved but which has never really made it the US. After years as an undergroundfilmmaker, Jia has made films through official channels though HOW they get approvedand made must remain a mystery, one that deepens with his new and critical look at theeffect of corruption, the sex trade and indifferent factories on the Chinese people.
The film covers four separate storylines though blessedly they don't artificially converge a
la Babel . The first and strongest story revolves around Dahai (Wu Jiang). This hilariously
pushy fellow is outraged over the corruption in his village, a stain that spreads from thepowerful man who flies in on a jet down to a local accountant and village chief. Jiang wasdiscovered by the great director Zhang Yimou for To  Live  (1994) and he commands the
screen with ease. The entire cast is strong but his presence is so warm and boisterous andfresh I wish the entire movie had stayed with him. Dahai is mocked and humiliated atevery turn and finally snaps in an orgy of violence that quickly becomes the movie'ssignature. The people of China do not suffer silently in these films; they lash out at othersand themselves again and again.
The second story involves a mysterious young man; we don't discover until the end of his
tale exactly how he makes his living but it's clearly a violent one on the edge of society.Still, while you wouldn't mess with him, it's notable that he doesn't seem like a threat toothers. It's a petty squabble during a gambling session at his local village on New Year'sthat turns brutal. He just watches impassively.</p>
<p>A third story centers on the mistress of a businessman and is the film's subtlest example
of dehumanization. She works in a hotel/massage parlor/brothel but it's the wife of the
businessman that first assaults her and calls her a whore. ("Did your mother give birth to
you just so you could seduce my husband?" demands the woman as she and some men
viciously beat the girl.) The violence throughout has been shocking but here in the film's
major visual misstep, the mistress turns into a warrior, fighting back in the style of a
samurai that seems silly and undercuts the movie's realism.
The fourth story involves a hapless kid working in a factory who takes a job at a high end
hotel/brothel, falls in love with a female coworker and generally feels helpless as his life
narrows down to a miserable job on yet another factory floor.
Throughout the film is well acted and shot and certainly the stories are filled with incident
by his standards. For Jia, this is practically Star  Wars  -- it's far more action packed and
accessible to a wide audience than his earlier films. Unfortunately, it stumbles too often.
The violence in the third tale is too stylish and the violence in the fourth tale is unearned.
How much more wrenching it would be to see that young guy trapped on a factory floor,
doomed like Sisyphus to the endless task of trying to get by.
Jia is too good to miss anything he makes and I won't be upset if this gains him fans in
the West. But far subtler, more ambitious work awaits anyone who plunges into hiscatalog of films. Still, A  Touch  Of  Sin  is a remarkably corrosive look at the price society
pays for corruption, dehumanization and other sins. And while others may profit, thefilm's final shot holds the audience -- all of us -- responsible for allowing it to continue.The tales apply to much of the world, not just China, but still you're surprised it got made.Maybe the authorities in China didn't watch it till the end? Or maybe they thought Jiawas somehow blaming the peasants rather than rallying them to change the system?However it got made and released, A  Touch  Of  Sin  is out in the world and you should
never underestimate the power of art.
