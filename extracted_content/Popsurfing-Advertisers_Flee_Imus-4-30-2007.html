            <p>Newer PostOlder PostW E D N E S D AY,  A P R I L  1 1 ,  2 0 0 7Advertisers Flee ImusVariety says four of Don Imus's top ten sponsors are pulling their adsfrom his show, though they don't detail whether this refers to his radioshow, his MSNBC TV show (which was beginning to challenge CNN inthe ratings) or both. But let's make one thing clear: none of theseadvertisers are leaving Imus because of the bigoted, racist commentshe and his cohorts on the show delivered about the Rutgers' basketballteam. No way: bigoted, obnoxious comments like those have beenImus's stock in trade for many, many years. Some people ignore thosecomments and like the lengthy time he devotes to politics andsubstantive issues. Others like how Imus can flog a serious book andturn it into a bestseller. But all those people are kidding themselves ifthey think they can pick and choose what parts of Imus they findacceptable. His show traffics in typical, shock jock inflammatorycomments that play on obnoxious stereotypes for cheap laughs andImus has been doing it for years. All his advertisers knew this. Theyjust think that now everyone else knows it too and this could damagetheir image. If this hadn't gained traction, they would have happilyadvertised on Imus's show for years to come and laughed at his nastyjokes and contributed to his charity and thought that makes it all okay.And they all advertise on shock jocks just as bad as Imus all over theradio every day. Now they'll just have to switch their ad dollars toGlenn Beck.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
