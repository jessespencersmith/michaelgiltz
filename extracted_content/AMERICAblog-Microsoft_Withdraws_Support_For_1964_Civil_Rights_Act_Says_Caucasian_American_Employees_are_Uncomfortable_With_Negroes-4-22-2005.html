4/22/2005 12:21:00 PMFrom tomorrow's paper:Microsoft is now under fire for its lack of support on equalrights for blacks. For years, the company had touted itsembrace of equal rights for its black employees andcustomers as a sign of how progressive and forward lookingthe company was. But key elements of the Civil RightsVoting Act are set to expire in 2007 and Microsoft hasquietly switched its stance from supporting renewal to"neutral."Critics say Microsoft is caving in to pressure from anevangelical preacher. (Evangelical groups have acenturies-long history of opposing equal rights for women,blacks, gays, non-Christians and Christians who don'tinterpret the Bible the same way they do.) Microsoft admitsit met with the evangelical preacher but insists that hadnothing to do with its change in stance.The preacher says differently. "I threatened them with anational boycott of their products and they backed off, "says the preacher who doesn't represent any national groupbut insists Microsoft has "a lot" of white employees who findthe company's stance on equal rights for blacks offensive.According to several Microsoft employees, the company'sgeneral counsel met with a group of black employees andtold them about the company's switch. Apparently, it waspresented as "good news, bad news." The "good news" wasthat Microsoft was really going to resist the pressure it wasgetting to fire the employees who had testified as privatecitizens in support of renewing the Civil Rights Voting Act."We are NOT going to fire anyone at this time," the generalcounsel reportedly said. The "bad news" was that their rightto vote was toast.Ironically, Microsoft has received numerous awards over thepast ten years for its active support of equal rights forblacks. A Microsoft spokesperson was asked, "Isn't equalrights for all Americans (not to mention all customers andemployees of Microsoft) a core value for the company?"No, not really," said the spokesperson. "It was just goodpr."[FYI - This is a parody, though only barely.]
