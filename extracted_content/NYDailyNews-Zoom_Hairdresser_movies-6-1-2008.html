€ MAKING THE CUT
N dam Sandler is a Mossad agent who yearns to be a hair stylist in New York City? That's the plot
ffi of the new comedy "You Don't Mess With the Zohan," which opens Friday. lt sounds absurd
$$ - not even a top secret agent could survive the pressure of coloring, bobbing and styling the
sN Nhair of Manhattan's fussiest, most demanding clients.
But Hollywood specializes in fantasy, and a great hair stylist is as much of a hero to the desperately
needy as any secret agent. Here are some of Hollywood's favorite hair-care specialists.
SHAMPOOO9TS) BARBERSHOP(2OO2>THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE
(2OOr)
Wash, rinse, repeat: Barbers are like
bartenders - they seem to know everyone's se-
crets. But Billy Bob Thornton has some secrets
of his own: His wife is sleeping with a business-man and Thornton is none too pleased about it.
Split ends: Some people should stick to
cutting hair. Thornton's plan to blackmail his
wife's lover and open a dry cleaning store gets
as messed up as a bad coloring job. Didn't he
realize this story was in black and white?
MichaelGiltz
Washi rinse, rcpeat Warren Beatty proved
once and for all that there's nothing sexier for
a woman than a man who can instinctively give
her the perfect new hairstyle.
Spllt ends: Not even Beatty can talk his way
out of sleeping with the wife, daughter and mis-
tress of a potential backer for his own salon.
Limp hair and a limp wrist won't cut it any longer.
SWEENEYTOOD:THE DEMON
BARBER OF FLEET STREET (2OO7)Wash, rinse, repeat: The black communi-
ty traditionally has had only a few sanctuaries,
among them the church and the barbershop.
lce Gube makes a much more convincing
barber than preacher; hence this hit comedy.
Split ends: Doesn't Jesse Jackson realize
you can say anything in a barbershop? Jokes
about Jackson and Rosa Parks are what
"Barbershop" is all about.
LEGALLY BLONDE (2OO1)
Wash, rlnse, repeat: In this Gothic musical,
Johnny Depp is a man on a mission - to prove
he's the best barber in London and win the
business of evil Alan Rickman.
split ends: Depp is indeed a full-service bar-
ber, providing a shave so close that you might
even object - if your throat weren't already cut.
Also has a side job providing the filling for some
lovely meat pies.Wash, rlnse, repeat: When Elle Woods
(Reese Witherspoon) needs a safe place to get
away from the stress of Harvard Law School,
she heads to a beauty salon.
Split ends: Waiting there for her is
mentor and friend Jennifer Coolidge with
a shoulder to cry on. Now if only someone
could help Coolidge make a delivery to the hot
UPS man,</p>
