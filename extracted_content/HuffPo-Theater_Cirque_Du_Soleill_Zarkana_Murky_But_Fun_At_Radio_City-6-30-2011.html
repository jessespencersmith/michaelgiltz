 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: Cirque Du Soleil's Zarkana
Murky But Fun At Radio City
ZARKANA  ** out of ****
RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL
The troupe Cirque du Soleil is a victim of its own
success. Cirque virtually reinvented the circus formodern audiences. But over the years so many of their
new shows have popped up all over the world it's
inevitable that expectations have been raised andlowered many times. Sometimes they come up with agenuinely fresh way of presenting their acts that feelscohesive and original, that feels like a "show." Othertimes, it seems like Cirque has come to town and you'veseen it before.
But that's what the circus is like too. When Ringling Bros. comes to town, you'd don't expect someradical new experience. You expect clowns and trapeze artists and animal acts and cotton candy. Sure,
they usually give each edition a special name and hype some particular act, but it's the circus and you
know what that means.
The same is true for Cirque, especially after so many years of innovation. Their latest spectacle is
Zarkana , designed specifically for the grand space of Radio City Music Hall . Go into it expecting some
fresh new experience and you'll be disappointed. Go expecting to see some world-class acts with Cirque'susual Euro-pop trappings and you'll be fine.

<p>This particular show -- Zarkana  -- really is a load of nonsense. The ringleader Zark stands around singing
generic pop songs about his lost girlfriend (and his lost magical powers) and by the end of the show they
reunite. Usually, Cirque's songs are performed in a nonsense language; this time they chose to useEnglish lyrics, unfortunately, so you have to hear all sorts of blather in between the acts.
Fortunately, those acts come tumbling one after the other. Cirque makes good use of Radio City for some
grand visuals (like snakes crawling up the side of the proscenium; a spider's web and performers seemingto dangle in the air way, way in the distance until you realize it's video projection. I loved how they usedthe video screens to get the thousands of people focused on intimate acts like the wonderful sand artist
that opened act two. Act one began modestly with a juggler who actually had quite a few bobbles; this
was in fact a nice reminder that these stunts don't come automatically and unintentionally created anedge of suspense for the more daring feats. Since even a juggler can mess up, how much more dangerousis it when two men are jumping and whirling in the air both inside and outside metal cages that spinover and under each other high above the stage?
Even more suspense of an unintended sort was created when a man who we later discovered was an
expert in hand balancing came out on stage, felt the moment wasn't right for whatever reason, and simply
walked off again. The platform he abandoned stayed in the middle of the set for a few minutes while the
music continued and other performers stood around expectantly until the show finally moved on. Myguest said, "I'm totally confused" and laughed. It was another rare moment of quirkiness and the humanelement.
Far more often, acrobats whirled across the stage without missing a beat; men tossed flag-sticks high in
the air and across the stage to fellow performers, all of it in beautiful synchronicity; and artists formedhuman pyramids or swung each other through the air high above the stage and it all came off perfectly.
The tone might be a smidgen darker than usual. But the clowns are always on hand ready to dispel any
air of gloom after a six-limbed baby in an aquarium rolls across the stage or snakes and spiders havedominated the action for a few minutes. Sure, you've seen it all before, at least when it comes to thespecialty acts. But they're still daring and fun. Cirque can't reinvent the wheel any more. And sometimesas with Zarkana  they shouldn't try so hard to make it appear as if they are.
