            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 3 ,  2 0 0 6New Broadway Musical On Johnny Cash:Clueless?I've been sort of intrigued by Ring Of Fire, the new Broadway musicalthat uses the music of Johnny Cash in a revue to tell his life story. Why?Because it got good reviews out of town and it's created and directed byRichard Maltby Jr, a veteran theater composer with good taste. Butthen I see this crazy, clueless quote from him on the thousands of songshe had to go through for the show:“I was looking for songs in which there was talking, and hewrote more of those than I originally thought. I knew I had touse the really famous ones, like ‘A Boy Named Sue,’ ‘I Walk theLine,’ and ‘Folsom Prison Blues,’ or people would be upset. Forthe rest, I looked at the content to see how funny or sexy ormoving the songs were. I know some people don’t expect themusic of the ‘Man in Black’ to be any of those things.Huh? People don't expect the songs of country icon Johnny Cash to befunny or sexy or moving? Is he insane? Now I'm wondering if Maltbyever listened to Cash -- or any country music -- before doing thisproject.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
