8/09/2005 09:14:00 PMA tiny packet of peanut butter "stuffed" with milk, vitamins andminerals is revolutionizing the care of desperatelymalnourished children in Niger. As we know, the world watchedas Niger suffered the slow-motion catastrophe of starvationand did nothing when we could have saved so many for solittle. Now we are sort of acting, but it will cost a lot more andbe a lot less effective.One good bit of news: Plumpy'nut, that "sports bar" of sortsthat lets mothers feed their own children rather than have toleave the kids under the intensive care of a hospital. It reducescosts, leaves doctors free to treat the desperately ill and costsabout $20 for a month of Plumpy'nut. That's right, $5 a week.Which raises a question: if Plumpy'nut is good enough togive malnourished children in food emergencies, why notgive it to the countless thousands of children in Niger whoare hungry when the world's attention is directedelsewhere?To get 1.5 million children back onto the road to health would cost$30 million, known in international circles as "chump change."Paging the "culture of life" President. Hello? Are you there?
