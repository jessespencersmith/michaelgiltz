8/09/2004 05:25:00 PMSenator Chuck Schumer has formally asked the White House for anexplanation of why the identity of a turncoat in Al Quaeda activelyhelping us was leaked to the press just as criticism for the WhiteHouse's terror alert had put them on edge. Anger has come fromacross the political spectrum and overseas. The White Housespokesperson implies it was not a good idea. Condi's defense? It wasonly given on background. That, of course, admits that it was theirfault.Again look at what the White House did.1. It raised the terror alert and used that sobering step as anopportunity to pound the drum for Bush's reelection.2. It backtracked the next day by sending conflicting signals aboutthe currency of the info.3. It un-backtracked the next day by dribbling out more info andgetting a lot more explicit about current events that contributed tothe warning.4. It later leaked the name of an Al Quaeda spy to try and bolster itsimage when the criticism continued to build, thus damaging ongoinginvestigations, angering our allies and wasting a hugely valuable tool.Is it so much to ask that terror alerts not be linked to campaignpronouncements and that any info they need/want to offer be givenup front or not at all?
