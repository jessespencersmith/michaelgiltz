9/05/2005 02:17:00 AMNo debate here:The chaotic government response to Hurricane Katrina,which even President Bush said was ''not acceptable,'' wasthe inevitable result of federal policies emphasizingprotection from terrorist attacks at the expense ofpreparing for far more common natural disasters,state emergency officials and other experts said Friday.As hurricane survivors died along roadsides and at shelterswhere they were told to take refuge, or pleaded for foodand water or a ride to an overcrowded shelter, members ofCongress called for hearings to find out how the responseto this disaster could have failed so badly when the nationhas spent unprecedented billions of dollars in the name ofhomeland security.But the answer may not be much of a mystery.The Federal Emergency Management Agency, once apowerful independent agency focused solely on respondingto earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and other naturaldisasters that occur on average about four times a month,was placed within the huge Department of HomelandSecurity after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Homeland Security sends $1.1 billion each year to states tocombat terrorism, but $180 million to help prepare for suchdisasters as Katrina. Much of the terrorism grant moneyis given under conditions that specifically excludespending it on items or personnel that would be usedin responding to hazards other than terrorism.MAJOR DISASTERSSince 1995, the federal government has declared 562major disasters. All were natural disasters excepttwo terrorist attacks: Oklahoma City in 1995 and the9/11 attacks.
