3/14/2005 09:59:00 PMOne of the many, many details in the Vanity Fair article aboutHalliburton that is linked to below deals with its overchargingfor fuel. Now it turns out the Pentagon auditors finished theirwork in October 2004 -- one month before the election -- andBush promptly buried it despite repeated requests fromRepublicans and Democrats.Rep. Henry Waxman of California -- whose been slam-dunkingall over the place lately -- got a copy and released detailstoday. Among the highlights of Halliburton's thievery from theNYT:1. Halliburton ripped American tax-payers off of at least $108million in this one area of providing fuel -- that's much morethan was thought and the final tally could be much higher.2. A company Halliburton "outsourced" the real work to,Altanmia, is back in the spotlight with this. Depending on whoyou believe, Halliburton let them overcharge mightily becausethe Pentagon would pay any price and Halliburton's commissionwould only be higher. OR, if you prefer, sleazy people in theAdministration forced them to use this company for nefariousreasons of its own.3. "In one case, according to the report, the company claimedthat it had paid more than $27 million to transport liquefiedpetroleum gas it had purchased in Kuwait for just $82,000 - afee the auditors tartly dismissed as "illogical."" says the NYT.That's not illogical. And that's not overcharging. That's WARPROFITEERING. While young men and women are dying,Halliburton execs were staying in luxurious hotels, outsourcingthe work, doing crucial work often poorly and then ripping offthe American people. And these are Bush's friends.
