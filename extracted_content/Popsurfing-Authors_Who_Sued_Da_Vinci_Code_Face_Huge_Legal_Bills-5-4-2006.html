            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  M AY  0 4 ,  2 0 0 6Authors Who Sued "Da Vinci Code" Face HugeLegal BillsThe two authors who sued Dan Brown's publisher Random House forplagiarism in the UK now face massive legal bills. They have to pay85% of Random House's legal bill, plus all of their own lawyers' legalbills. It will total at least 2 million pounds. Since their case wasextremely weak on several fronts, they must really be regretting theiraction. Having to pay the other side's legal bills is one of the manyclever quirks in the UK. Their newspapers and magazines are muchmore carefree with rumors and gossip and half-truths that an Americannewspaper would never run with. Basically, the standards for provinglibel are lower in the UK (that's why the authors filed the suit in thatcountry) but if you LOSE a case you have to pay much of youropponents' legal fees. The result is a carefree press and fewer frivolouslawsuits.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
