From the Publisher: 'Don't talk bunk!' said Mr Douglas. 'You can't carry on
with the show with a man dying on stage. Drop the curtain!' When Douglas
B. Douglas - leading light of the London theatre - premieres his new
musical extravaganza, Blue Music, he is sure the packed house will bedazzled by the performance. What he couldn't predict is the death of hisstar, Brandon Baker, on stage in the middle of Act 2. Soon another
member of the cast is found dead, and it seems to be a straightforward
case of murder followed by suicide. Inspector Wilson of Scotland Yard -who happens to be among the audience - soon discovers otherwise.Together with Derek, his journalist son, Wilson takes charge ofproceedings in his own inimitable way. This is a witty, satirical novel from
the golden age of British crime fiction between the world wars. It is long
overdue for rediscovery and this new edition includes an informativeintroduction by Martin Edwards, author of  The Golden Age of Murder .

What We Say
Stuff and nonsense from start to finish. Huzzah! This dishy satire of the theater world and the mystery novel was first
published in 1934. You wouldn't know it from the ribald characters on tap, including Douglas B. Douglas (the impresariocapitalizing on a sudden death some 20 years before David Merrick appeared on Broadway), a starlet who entertains more
people at her home than on stage, the unflappable stagehand named Robert and the critic who writes his reviews up
beforehand because all these shows are the same -- just stuff and nonsense, from start to finish. Fans of the Great WhiteWay will love how little has changed, including obsessed fans who descend on a funeral like locusts and egotistical stars onthe rise and fall. Equally fun is Melville's tweaking of the conventions of the crime novel. He's got a police detective living
in luxury a la Lord Peter Wimsey, the detective's son working on a lark at a newspaper and so many clues and twists and
turns that I guarantee you won't figure out whodunnit or why. No really, you won't because the last thing Melville wasinterested in was playing fair and giving you all the clues. He pulls out the rug from under us during a farcical finale filledShare This Book

What Others Say
"I am going to go all out and say that Quick Curtain is the best detective novel I have read, after Agatha
Christie's. A big claim, yes, but deserved - this was a huge delight of a novel....a thousand hurrahs to the BritishLibrary and Martin Edwards for rediscovering Alan Melville." (Shiny New Books) "Alan Melville's Quick Curtain ismore than just a detective novel set in the theatre....Before the novel begins, there is a printed playbill of thecharacters and in the structuring of the novel itself where every chapter ends on a cliff-hanger, the way amelodramatic play might close an act or a scene. The style of writing, which is often used to set up a location or
a character can be likened to a play script, concise, sharp and crisp...For all those who enjoy comic detective
novels, which don't take themselves too seriously I would definitely recommend this tale; the humorous
investigative style and dialogue of Inspector Wilson and Derek make this an enjoyable read." (Crossexamining
Crime) "Full marks to Melville for his Pagliacci-like premise, which predates Michael Innes' better-known use ofonstage homicide in Hamlet, Revenge! by three years, and for a confident, waspish wit perfectly suited to histheatrical milieu..." (Kirkus Reviews) "Melville's jaunty, chatty tone (he frequently reminds readers where theyare in the plot) gives us an insider's look at everyone connected to the theater world, including critics whorecycle their reviews. A wonderfully fun British Library Crime Classics revival." (Connie Fletcher Booklist)
