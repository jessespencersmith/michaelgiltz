Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayA frustrating introduction to a new series with a clever premise. The School For Unusual Girls is in fact a trainingschool for spies. But the young women aren't recruited; they're dumped there by indifferent parents who believe theschool is in fact a viciously effective final desperate measure. So when Georgina Fitzwilliam burns down her parents'horse stable with yet another foolish scientific experiment, they coldly drop her there, washing their hands of a willfulchild with a mind of her own that simply won't fit in. Georgina herself believes the school will  turn to torture in order tomake her a "proper" young lady. But in fact the school plans to encourage her talents while ALSO teaching her toblend in with society so Georgina can serve her country as a spy and scientist. Sounds fun, no? Unfortunately, thisopener has numerous problems. One, there's precious little training that goes on: Georgina shows up, invents a newundetectable invisible ink that might just save her country in 48 hours ("It can't be done!" "I've done it!") and is off onan assignment before you blink an eye. Also, dashes of mild, unnecessary magic (like other students who havevisions, commune with animals and so on) is both intrusively present but not developed enough to actually feelgermane. Finally, romance is rather obviously handled, with Georgina and a beau inevitably frustrated by and drawnto each other within one minute of meeting. This would all be forgettable in other hands. But author Kathleen Baldwinhas a deft hand and one has the sense she really could deliver a corker of a novel with more discipline, more focusand less lazy plotting. (I really dislike period novels in which characters prematurely invent flying gliders or machinesjust as an easy way to achieve a goal.) Baldwin can dash off readable pages; here's hoping any success this haspushes her to aim higher next time. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“A School for Unusual Girls sucked me in from the first few pages and kept me reading until late into the night.Kathleen Baldwin has created a completely original—and totally engrossing—world, full of smart girls, handsomeboys, and sinister mysteries.
