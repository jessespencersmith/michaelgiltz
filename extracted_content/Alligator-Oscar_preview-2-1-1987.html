scar predictions 
and Ac~derny predilections 
By MICHAEL GIL1Z 
Do you remember what film won 
the Best Picture Oscar last year? 
Do you care? Well, 
maybe not (It was 
Pl4toon). But 
everyone in Hol­
lywood does. This 
Monday night 
they'll all be 
gathered together 
for the Academy 
Awards, and even 
the people who 
aren't nominated 
probably secretly hope their names will be called to 'receive that 
golden statuette. 
An Oscar meou,s prestige. An 
Oscar means recognition from 
your peers. An Oscar means you_ 
go to the head of the line for good 
projects. But most of all, an Oscar 
means money. 
How much? ,4.rell, it depends on 
the films nominated and how suc­
cessful they've already been, but a 
good rule of thumb is that an 
Oscar for Best Picture can mean an 
extra $20 million .,t the box office. 
Of course, if you're lucky enough 
to. grab a handful of major awards 
-an event that happens less and less as the Academy has grown 
fond of spreading the joy -you 
can expect even more. 
As you might expect, wh~n 
there's money to be had, there's 
money to be spent. Studios spend 
millions of dollars promoting their 
best contenders to the small pool 
of Academy voters, hoping to 
sway them with swanky promo­
tions or even just remind the ab­
sentininded members of the films 
that opened up 10 or 12 months 
before the voting occurs. 
Furthermore, actors and direc­
tors with enough pow~ insert 
clauses into their contracts oblig-ing the studios to spend a certain 
amount of money to promote their 
latest flicks. This results in the 
amusing sight of advertisements . 
pushing Sylvester Stallone for Best 
Actor consideration for his fine 
work in 0rJer The Top. 
But in the end, it comes down to 
the voters, and no one can predict 
what they'll do from year to year. 
Inevitably, there are surprises and 
that is what makes Oscar so excit­
ing. Katharine Hepburn spurns 
the event but has received more 
Best Actress Oscars than anyone 
else, while Steven Speilberg -
who would probably do back flips if it would help his chances -
can't even get nominated. 
This year is no exception. Who 
hasn't been nominated is invariab­
ly as interesting as who was, and 
Monday'night is certain to prove 
as provocative (not to mention 
overlong and boring) as ever. 
If there is any discemable trend, 
it is that the Academy has grown 
less wary of box office success, 
going so fat as to give multiple 
nominations to the runaway 
smash, Fatal Attraction. The follow­
ing are predictions of who will 
win in the major categories, as 
well as who deserves to win. If 
they all prove correct, I'll be even 
more .s~prised than if they don't. 
BEST PICfURE 
The voters are notorious 
Anglophiles -as recent winners 
Gandhi and Chariots of Fire will 
.. happily attest to -but the stately, 
intelligent epic The lAst Emperor 
will edge out Hope and Glory for 
the top award. Moonstruc1c is a 
dark horse possibility, but its 
achievements are too minor. BrOtUl­
CIlSt News failed to get a Best Direc­
tor nomination, greatly dimming 
its prospects, since the Best Pic­
ture and Best Director awards go 
hand in hand. Fatlll Attnu:tion \ 
made too much money. 
Who deserves to win? (In all 
cases, I Ilmit myself to the nomina­
tions.) Well, The lAst Emperor, an 
impressive, stirring piece of work 
from Bernardo Bertolucci. It is in 
the grand tradition of Hollywood 
and wonderfully effective to boot. 
The Academy's failure to 
nominate the sensational leads -
John Lone and Joan Chen -sure­
ly.ranks as the biggest gaffe of the</p>
<p>_ year. But Hope and Glory or Broad­
cast News would be noble choices 
as well. 
BESTA€fOR 
Michael Douglas will win with 
his flashy role in Wall Street for a 
number of reasons. First and 
foremost, he is very much a mem­
ber of the Hollywood community 
with impressive producing creden­
tials (One Flew 0f1eT The Cuckoo's 
Nest and The Chi,.. Synd~), as 
well as the family tradition (Dad 
Kirk) to draw upon. Plus, his solid 
work in Fatal Attraction is still very 
much in their minds. This is his 
year, what with box office success 
and his'emergence as a serious 
actor, and they'll love topping it 
off with an Oscar. 
His stiffest competition is from 
Jack Nicholson, but Ir01lweeil was 
too downbeat for them to pay 
much attention, beloved as Jack 
may be. William Hurt is also a 
comer, but he's been nominated a 
lot and won for Kiss Of The Spider . 
Woman in 1985. Marcello 
Mastroianni and Robin Williams 
are just happy to be npminated. 
Who should win? Well, Nichol­
son was excellent, but the perfor­
mance I enjoyed the most was 
Hurt's in Broadcast News. He'd 
seem to have fallen into a rut play­
ing earnest young intellectuals, 
but here he accomplished some­
thing I never expected: Hurt 
played a believable dummy. To Broadcast News, the 
romantic comedy from 
James L. Brooks, has 
made a star of Oscar­
nominated Holly Hunter 
me, this one role has shown that 
he is in it for the long haul. 
BEST ACfRESS 
Next to the Best Picture category, 
this is the toughest call of all. 
Meryl Streep is adored by the 
Academy and gave a remarkable 
performance in IronWeed, but it 
waS downbeat and they want to 
give her name a rest for a few 
years. Glenn Close is also a strong 
contender and her all-out, over­
the-top performance as an erotic 
psychotic is the kind they love to 
reward. 
But the winner will be Holly 
Hunter. Broadcast News was a criti­
cally acclaimed film from the 
much-admireclJames L. Brooks 
and this is their one chance to 
~gnize it. Besides, her perfor­
mance was terrific. Cherts nomina­
tion was a sign of respect -she'll 
win next time. Kirkland has al­
ready received her gift from the 
Academy and won't be expecting 
anything more. 
BEST DIRECfOR 
Throughout the long history of 
the awards, only a handful of 
times have the Best Picture and 
Best Director awards gone 
separate ways. So, if The Last 
Emperor wins as I expect, Bertoluc­
ci will cop this one. If HoPe and 
Glory wins, Boorman will too. But 
they're so close in the running -
with Moonstruck breathing down 
their necks -that this ~ry well 
might be a year in which the 
. awards are split.

category where everyone deserves 
to win. " 
BESf SUPPORTING ACTRESS

faces. Ann SOthern for what

A True Story? The Academy al­
ways tries to have a little fun and 
thill category shows it. Their most 
worthy instance of plucking a per­
formance from obscurity was 
Anne Ramsey's hilarious role in 
Throw Momma From The Train, an 
otherwise wretched little film. 
But the winner will be Olympia 
Dukakis for her wonderful job in 
Moonstruck as an Italian mother. 
She's been around for years, and, 
besides, her relative's high profile 
on the campaign trail has kept her 
name uppermost in their minds. 
Not that it matters to the 
Academy, but she also happens to 
be the most deserving. BESf FOREIGN 
LANGUAGE FILM 
In a year fraught with uncertain­
ty where no film has come to 
dominate the proceedings, this 
category is the clearest of all. Ap­
parently, My Life As A Dog was 
being pushed for Best Picture con­
sideration, thus splitting its votes 
between these two categories and 
failing togetnominated in either. 
That leaves the fierd wide open 
for Au Revoir Les Enfants (GOodliye-­
Children), the more deserving of 
the two. Based on the experiences 
of director Louis Malle in oc­
cupiE;d France during World War 
II, it is a beautifully realized, per­
fect film." 
Yet to arrive in Gainesville, Au 
Revoir Les Enfants is a remarkable 
achievement. It will be cherished 
and remembered by movie lovers 
long after most of the other actors 
and movies nominated have be­
come mere footnoteS ". And that is 
the greatest award of all.</p>
