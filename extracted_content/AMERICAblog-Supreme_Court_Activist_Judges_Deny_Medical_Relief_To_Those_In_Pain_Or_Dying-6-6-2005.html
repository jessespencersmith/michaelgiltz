6/06/2005 08:42:00 PMThe Supreme Court ruled today that the federal governmentcan prosecute people whose own doctors recommend medicalmarijuana to relieve pain or even help in their recovery. They'drather stone patients than see them get stoned, even if it is themost medically efficient way of providing comfort and relief tothe sick.Whatever you think of the ruling. the 6-3 decision penned byJohn Paul Stevens is a case of hypocrisy by the court's far rightjudges since they pretend to support states' rights but backaway from that philosophy whenever it involves somethingthey object to, like medical marijuana.--30--P.S. The symbol "--30--" is old journalism shorthand for "end ofstory" or in this case, end of blog.
