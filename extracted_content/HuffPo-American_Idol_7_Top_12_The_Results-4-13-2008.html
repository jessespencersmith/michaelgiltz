American Idol  Top 12: The Results

The results show began with a very expensive promo for Horton Hears A Who , which Ryan
Seacrest said with scripted punk-rock attitude was a FOX movie. Way to read a cue card, Ryan!
Then we saw Jim Carrey in the audience wearing an elephant suit, which went on a bit too long.And THEN we saw Jim Carrey sitting with the kids on the bench and joking he should have neversung that REO Speedwagon tune. And that was really one lame plug too many.
Then the kids did their Up With People performance, this time a medley of Beatles songs. Ryan
also said the Beatles tunes were so popular they were gonna be the theme for next week as well. Ithought Michael Johns had the best spotlight during their various trade-offs of vocals.
In the recap of the night before, they skipped over thenegative reviews of most singers, showing only thebad comments for Jason Castro, David Archuleta and
the one lock for the bottom three: Kristy Lee Cook.
Syesha -- She was the first announced for the
bottom three. No surprise, since her performance the night before slipped by without leaving any
impression. This time, her "Got To Get You Into My Life" was a little better. And her hair was a lotbetter.
Kristy  -- Then Kristy joined the bottom three. She knew it, saying "Where's the microphone?" (to
sing) even before Ryan announced she was one of the lowest vote-getters. She sang "Eight Days A
Week" again and since she didn't bounce around as much, Kristy kept her breathing steady and dida little better on the vocals. Simon said the song wasn't suited for country, even though LorrieMorgan covered it well in 1987. I've often wondered if the contestants can work on the songs andrearrange them for the results show if they weren't happy with how it went. It would be a greatchance to see them fixing mistakes and getting better, a tiny recompense for being on the bubble.
Phone calls  -- A cheesy, low-rent low point for Idol was watching Ryan take live phone calls from

Ryan then made a confusing transition by saying that John Lennon and Paul McCartney didn't just
write songs for the Beatles, they also wrote hits for a lot of other artists. And here's Kat to sing a
George Harrison classic. Huh? What Ryan meant to say was that Lennon and McCartney weren't
the only ones to write hits for the Beatles. So did George...etc. etc. Then Kat McPhee came out --
wearing a sexy short dress that would have won her the entire competition if she's worn it to the
finals two seasons ago -- and sang "Something," a song Frank Sinatra famously called the best love
song of the last fifty years when he began singing it in the Seventies. (He also repeatedly credited it
to Lennon and McCartney, even though Harrison wrote it.) She looked smashing and sang well and
had hitmeister David Foster accompanying her on piano. Proof that you don't have to win Idol  to
win With Foster behind her, Kat's second album is sure to be much more commercial.
David Hernandez  -- He joined the bottom three as well. I figured it would happen when he was
paired with Ramiele since I doubted three girls would get the three lowest votes. I forgot there was
a bottom three, but at least my personal bottom four seemed on target: I had picked Syesha,Ramiele, Kristy and David. David sang "I Saw Her Standing There" with grim determination and Ihad the same sinking feeling that one of my favorites who hadn't reached his potential yet wasgoing home. And he was. He was polite and composed,  though I was hopeful for a moment he'd
make some bold statement on live television.
Next week more Beatles and I couldn't be happier. But my girl Syesha has to have a breakthrough
moment soon or she might slip away soon, while far less talented singers than her and David carryon. Was David the right one to go home and who do you think is headed home next?

didn't actually watch the shows on Tues/Wed due to work, but have caught performances on YouTube. 
I'm glad I missed all the filler before the actual singing, I didn't even know Tues was a two hour
episode.
Thought David Cook did really well as well as Chikizie who seems to coming on really strong in thecompetition.David A was like Simon said "A mess". But he was in absolutely no danger of leaving.I was sorry to see David H go, he was one of my favorites, but his performance wasn't very good. Ihope he can use AI as a springboard to bigger and better things in the future.

I keep watching Chikezie's "She's a Woman" over and over, he was pretty damn good on that song.Plus, I love old-timey mountain music!
jadez See Profile  I'm a Fan of jadez  permalink
this is the first season of idol i have watched.i wanted to see what it was all about and why other people seem to enjoy it so much.first off i admit that my preference for music is Sinatra, Piaf. Ella, Billy Holiday.etc..and opera, ofcourse.And i believe KD Lang is the finest female singer in the world today.i say that not so much to comparebut to offer insite into what i believe is good music.I dont believe there are any great singing voices on the entire show. to my ear David Cook is the bestsinger but this show is not about that. if it were how could anyone explain that ONLY cute skinny girlsand good looking (mostly gay) guys can sing? i mean isnt there at least ONE guy or girl who is fat and
can belt out a song as good as these people?
and thats how i see the entire show. a built in marketing tool to get an audience ready to part with there
cash for the most popular person.
people should get what they desire is the argument and i can agree to that but lets NOT pretend idol is
discovering the finest singers in the country.just the other day i read on some board a women, young i am guessing, who stated she "was in love"with one of the singers!.sheesh.anyway from the paid coca-cola glasses to the shilling of other fox products the entire show is just a bigcommercial.as far as the judging goes i actually find Simon to be the most honest and offers the most insight.of course all the banter against him is just silly and lets not forget that the auditions of this show areMEANT to humiliate the wannabees and the viewers love it.otherwise we would just see a string of worthy talent by comparison.
last night we saw the elimination of the only "known" gay man.
he was doomed as soon as it became known.
bottom line?
there are many worse shows on tv (the show that follows it comes right to mind).i wish all the singers well and hope their dreams come true.
but i cant imagine myself looking forward to listening to an entire album by any of them.

Jadez, thanks for checking out the show and commenting. I own every officially released
Sinatra and he's one of the few artists I buy bootlegs as well. And kd lang is indeed one ofthe most gifted singers of all time -- her new album Watershed is lovely, by the way. Idol isnot technically looking for the best singer on the planet, so much as a more general talentshow uncovering a good singer and personality who could be a pop star. (Not the same thing,of course.) Hey, it worked for the Monkees and they had talent too, so don't knock "fake"
groups or talent show winners like Ella Fitzgerald or Tony Bennett. And no, no one in the
seven seasons or the next seven seasons will hold a candle to either of them. Your
perception that only cute girls and cute (sometimes gay) guys go far is I have to say off-target. If you look at the past seasons, the most interesting thing about Idol is that a talentshow where viewers vote for their favorites has not produced the teen idol pin-ups you would
expect -- and certainly not the teen idol pinups found in manufactured boy bands and the like.
Season One winner was Kelly Clarkson, a healthy, normal girl but chubby and not glamorousby pop music standards (when she won, she's had makeovers a plenty since then). Seasontwo's winner was an extremely obese man who sang gospel and r and b named Ruben
Studdard. The runner-up was a super geeky guy named Clay Aiken who would not have
been allowed in the door of any major label, much less been given a contract. Ever. Season
three -- illiterate, raspy-voiced street-wise single mom Fantasia, who became a legitimate star
on broadway (in the right role). And on and on. This season's David Archuleta (very PartridgeFamily ready) and other sexy singers headed for the finals are very much the exception.They're exactly what record labels would have predicted audiences would prefer but viewershave consistently ranged much farther afield and found themselves identifying much morewith real people with talent that lunchbox-ready teen idols. And that's been one of the mostunexpected and satisfying aspects of the entire spectacle.
jadez See Profile  I'm a Fan of jadez  permalink
points well takin as i have admitted this is the first season i have watched.so natuarally my perceptions are limited to this season .
your explaination of what the show is really about will temper my reaction the next
time i hear someone raving about the "idol" having the greatest singing voice ever.
of course the public is entitled to support who they like best.
i have no problem with that.
well its 2;14 am
time for Sinatras.

The name you wanted wasn't Kat McPherson. She is Katharine McPhee.
And watching the results show is getting a tooth pulled without anaesthetic. I look up the loser online
and watch something more interesting.
As for who left, Kristy Lee Cook should've been booted, not David Hernandez, though I'd be more
content with David's departure if Cook hadn't massacred "Eight Days a Week."

Whoops. Thanks for the correction. That's what I get for filing at 2 in the morning afterattending a concert (a talented singer named Hilary McRae) followed by some NCAAbasketball at Madison Square Garden. I know the results show is a waste of time but can'tstop myself.

I totally agree with both previous comments. This show needs to be watched on DVR/TiVo. Wewatched the 2 hour performance show in 1 hour. We just can't stand all the extra chit chats and banterand Paula's useless patronizing comments. And Ryan's insulting Simon is getting more and more

uncomfortable to watch. I think the power of hosting has gone to his head and he's taking advantage of
that and the fact that a lot of people think Simon is a bully. He thinks people will like him more if he
picks on Simon but it's just too much. 
I too think the top 6 will be both Davids, Carly, Brooke, and hopefully Michael and Amanda. I'm ready
for a more interesting, grittier Idol winner, one with a little more depth not the same old pop singer. Just
because they sing well doesn't mean they're entertaining to watch (Jordin). I think David Cook andBrook White would probably be the most bankable ones.

Definitely can only handle when Tivo'd - if not for the commercials, but at least to skip throughPaula's haze of chopped English.
I think the producers are ridding themselves of any "problem" contestants.
If rumors are true, look for Brooke to be ushered off soon - as well as Amanda.
I think Karly and David A are "pegged" to go all the way.
David Cook is the most talented IMO. I also love Jason Castro

What rumors? I've heard about Amanda's traffic thing but I haven't heard anything
about Brooke. I really hope Brooke stays for a while she's my number two pick. I likeAmanda, I think she's a good singer but sometimes her voice is just too much tohandle and she seems like she doesn't want to be there half the time. I agree, Ithink David cook is the most talented and I like Jason Castro for some reason, I likethe little imperfections in his voice, they add some kind of sensitivity to the song, Idon't know it's hard to explain.

The peddling that went on last night was nothing new to American Idol. AI has been doing this for manyif not all the seasons and although I agree it stinks, it's par for the course. If you want to watch the
show you have to be willing to be raped while watching it. A good way to combat the raping is to TiVo it
or DVR it and fast forward through all the horrible Simon/Ryan banter, Simon being rude to Paula,
Paula saying a whole lot of nothing, and Corporate America sheepherding. I chose to DVR the
episodes and I wouldn't watch it any other way. It's about having some say in what you ingest. It's a
MUST!!!
That being said, back to the shows results. Yes, I think David was the right one to go home; however, I
would have preferred to see Kristy Lee Cook go first, but David would have just went next weekanyway. I know it's unfair to make that assumption since I have not seen next week"s performances,but trust me, David's time was up. It's not that he is bad, it's just that there are too many other peoplethat are much better and something"s gotta give. Ya know?
Which leads me to Kristy Lee Cook, Syesha Mercado, Ramiele Malubay, Jason Castro, and Chikezie. I
believe that all of these people mentioned will go in the next 5 weeks in no specific order. They willleave behind Michael Johns, Carly Smithson, Brooke White, David Archuleta, David Cook, andAmanda Overmyer. Those will be AI's final six. They are either the most talented, most attractive, mostentertaining, or the most risky of the final 11.
I unlike many people this past week, LOVED Amanda"s performance. I thought it was immensely
entertaining; from the way she changed the song arrangement, to her style of singing, it was different
and she truly entertained me. Whereas, some of the others, eh, not so much. This late or early in thegame, I am most enjoying Amanda and Brooke and could see Brooke winning it all.
What are your thoughts?

such a deep year for the talent, I wouldn't be surprised to see Chikezie or Castro make it
either. Brooke is definitely coming on strong. Not the best voice, but she's been really smart
about staying in that singer-songwriter vein.
herronsmith See Profile  I'm a Fan of herronsmith  permalink
Well, I guess I will start things off here. Firstly, this show has got to rid itself of Ryan Seacrest.. Initially
his jabs about Simon were playful and the banter evenly distributed. Now he has gotten down right
rude and insulting taking every opportunity to cut into Cowell. I was actually embarrassed (and I don't
even really like the show) for some unexplained reason that made me feel like I was a voyeur. I hadthe feeling Simon felt the comments were (c)overtly sexual in nature or nasties only the two of themshared. It is obvious the banter makes Simon uncomfortable and to do that is troubling. I mean, he cangenerally hold his own. I would have gotten up and left had I been Simon Cowell as it was so veryobvious. Seacrest needs to take a step back or a line will be crossed that may tarnish the show'sstellar? reputation. Perhaps Seacrest believes the kiddies won't "get it" but there are those of us whoare watching to see if new talent is really is going to win out. I gotta agree with you about the Carey appearance and "forcing us to sit through ridiculous padding(peddling) like this". It was a ghastly display of corporate propaganda.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Glad you agreed about the over-the-top product plug of Jim Carrey's movie (even by theproduct placement happy standards of Idol). Again, Ryan and Simon are very good friends soit's not really personal. They're just goofing on each other. But I agree one hundred percentthat it's very very tiresome. That said, Idol has no desire to change a single element of theshow. It would survive any of the judges leaving (i'd make a good one by the way, Idol; areyou listening? Idol? Didn't think so) including even Cowell and a change in host. But as bored
as the judges sometimes get and as often as they sink into familiar patterns, it's the number
one show in the country and you hate to mess with a winning formula.
