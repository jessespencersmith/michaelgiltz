Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayA mystery set in the contemporary world of the Mormons, with the wife of a bishop as the sleuth? Count me in.Unfortunately, the plotting of this debut novel by Mette Ivie Harrison is far stronger on Mormonism than mystery.Linda Wallheim loves her faith and her world, even though she's clearly on the progressive side of her religion. Thework of her husband Kurt is challenging and important and Linda supports him and performs her job well. But thedaily challenges of their life are soon overwhelmed with multiple dramas unfolding. A neighbor insists his wife hasdisappeared and left behind their 5 year old daughter. The man and his father's disdain for the child's mother makesLinda suspicious over foul play. At the same time, another member of their community is watching her husbandslowly die and Linda becomes suspicious about what happened to that man's first wife as well. Linda is not much of asleuth and rather passive at that until the climax of the tale allows her to take some bold action. Harrison is farstronger at delineating some of the interesting facets of Mormon life and the philosophy that guides them in theirdealings with each other and the outside world. (It does involve a great deal of baking, with Linda always seeming topop this or that goodie into the oven as a response to most any crisis.) A subplot even raises the possibility that oneof her five sons might be gay, though this is left for resolution in perhaps a sequel. So the world Harrison creates isvivid and the characters often compelling. But as a mystery, "The Bishop's Wife" falls far short. Either Harrison needsto bone up on her "Father Brown" or perhaps segue into a straightforward novel that doesn't need the trappings ofgenre to compel. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPraise for The Bishop's WifeABA IndieNext Selection for January, 2015An ABA IndieBound BestsellerPLA LibraryReads Selection for January, 2015A Publishers Weekly Most Anticipated Book of Fall 2014“The Bishop’s Wife has good reason to draw a large readership. It places heavy emphasis on domestic abuse and onthe question of how dangerous fire-breathing extremists really are. The man who inveighs against women as whoresand sinners may or may not be anything worse than a crank. The man who speaks sanctimoniously of them may bemuch worse... That’s why Ms. Harrison’s Linda is such a welcome character: In her role as Sister Wallheim, sheencourages women to speak freely, at least to her, and to escape the shame that has burdened some of them sincechildhood."—Janet Maslin, The New York Times"Excellent... Watching Linda Wallheim take on the church and its entitled male members as she unravels the mysteryof Carrie's and Helena's disappearances is one of the chief pleasures of this richly detailed debut." —The Los Angeles Times "Eye-opening... A novel so far…</p>
