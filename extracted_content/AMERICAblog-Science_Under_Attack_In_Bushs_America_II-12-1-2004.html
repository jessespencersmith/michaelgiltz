12/01/2004 11:41:00 AMAs the poll in an earlier posting about people's understandingof evolution shows, basic scientific facts are under attack inBush's America. USA Today details how the debate overwhether religion should be taught in science classes under theguise of "Intelligent Design" (ie. Creationism in a tuxedo) israging across the country.Here's one thought: the next time someone tries to shove theirreligious beliefs into your local public school's science class,make a counter proposal. Demand that the school teach thatthe pyramids in Egypt were built by aliens. You could quicklyprint out lists of hundreds -- if not thousands -- of books,movies and TV specials that bolster this claim and prove it's avalid "scientific theory" that your kids should not be deniedhearing in the interest of fairness.Also propose that your kids be taught humans were put onearth by aliens, the truth about UFO abductions, time travel,how we didn't really travel to the moon (it was faked, youknow) and you name it. There are plenty of quack "scientists"with actual degrees who will argue for this bunk. Once yourschool board has to deal with a whole bunch of junk "science,"they might be more willing to dismiss it ALL in favor ofaccepted scientific fact. Point out that not ONE public universityteaches Creationism as a valid scientific fact and ask why youwant to teach your children something that every reputablecollege in the country will tell them is idiotic and wrong.Next week: how to defend your geography class fromfundamentalists who insist the world is flat.
