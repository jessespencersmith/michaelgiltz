The 
Machinist/American 
~cho: Collector's 
Edition **I,each 
Paramount, $29.99/Lions Gate, 
$19.98 
The June 15 debut of "Batman 
Begins" will hopefully send 
fans in search of the 
challenging, fascinating movies 
starring Christian Bale. Two of 
them prove what De Niro-like 
lengths he'll go for a part. 
"Machinist" is a Kafkaesque 
tale about a man literally 
wasting away -Bale is so 
emaciated it's painful to see. 
On the flip side, the uneven but 
fascinating '~merican Psycho," 
due June 21, shows Bale in 
stunningly handsome form 
with a toned, ripped body that 
would put most male models -
" ~f{~ck, most Greek gods -to ' 
shame. 
Lois & Clark: The New 
Adventures of 
Superman -First ·-season -*** Warner Bros., $59.98 
'0 "Smallville" could learn a few 
lessons in lightening up from 
this delightful romantic 
comedy spin on the Man of 
Steel. Along with all 21 
episodes we get a bonus 
"Smallville" episode and a new 
full-length documentary, 
featuring Dean Cain and Teri 
Hatcher. And anyone suffering The Sopranos: 
f"1fth Season * HBO $99.98 
Let's admit it, this fme 
series peaked two years 
ago. And with a bear 
lumbering onto the 
Soprano compound at 
the start of this season, 
subtlety wasn't in the 
cards. Still, the stellar 
cast keeps it afloat. And 
thank God Drea de 
Matteo got her Emmy 
before being sentenced 
to "Joey." One great 
series, with its fIrst 
season out on DVD, is 
Denis Leary's fIrefIghter 
drama "Rescue Me" 
(Sony, $49.95) -
complex, bitter, and 
fascinating. 
from "Desperate Housewives" 
withdrawal should jump at 
"Footballers Wives" (Capital, 
$34.98), a British soap opera 
about the jaded wives of soccer 
superstars that makes 
"Desperate" seem positively 
tame in comparison. 
Be Cool 
*'1, 
MGM, $27.98 
If only Vince Vaughn had 
been working in the '40s. He'd 
have made a perfect character 
actor for Warner Bros. in its 
heyday -adding just the right 
spice to different films with 
his patented pseudo tough-guy 
weasel shtick. Vaughn's 
certainly one of the few 
reasons to check out this too 
little, too late sequel to "Get 
Shorty" that switches the 
action from movies to the 
music biz but leaves behind 
the wit and hUmor of the 
original.</p>
