DVDs: A Lost Masterpiece, TV's Coolest New
Show (This Week) And More
 01/22/2016 03:53 am ET  | Updated  Jan 22, 2016

A new year and a new flood of DVD and BluRay releases. We start with a
lost landmark of French cinema, dive into the coolest show on TV (at least
until yet another one is dubbed even cooler next week) and then all betsare off. It's only January and thanks to the ever-rising spectre ofstreaming video on demand, studios are emptying their vaults faster than
ever.
OUT 1 BOXED SET  ($99.95 BluRay and DVD combo; Carlotta)
Like Abel Gance's Napoleon , French director Jacques Rivette's 1971DVDs: A Lost Masterpiece, TV's Coolest New Show (This Week) And More</p>
<p>masterpiece Out 1  is much-discussed but rarely seen, a rabbit-hole of a
movie that's more than 12 hours long (in one version) and essentially
invisible. Napoleon  is difficult to screen for technical reasons; Out 1  simply
wasn't available. Now finally the movie has been restored and screened
in cinemas. But it will surely find its real audience via this beautifully madeboxed set. Like the standard bearers from Criterion, this release from
Carlotta is impeccable. You get the entire 12+ hour epic on both BluRay
and DVD. You also get the shorter version dubbed Spectre on bothBluRay and DVD. And to make sense of it all, you get a new 90 minute
documentary that talks with many of the principals as well as using
archival footage to try and nail this sucker down. Like much of Rivette'swork, it's wildly experimental. Inspired by Balzac, it includes not one buttwo theater troupes, each rehearsing plays by Aeschylus. That is just the
starting point for this sprawling, interlocking work. In cinemas, it was
shown in marathon sessions. I think perhaps it will play best over eightnights, with each episode running about 90 or so minutes. You could ofcourse watch it in four nights or binge watch it all in one day. Each
experience would surely reveal different facets of this infuriating,
fascinating work. Just seeing the damn thing makes the cineaste in mefeel a little more noble. But more than that, it starts to give Rivette's
career a shape I hadn't appreciated before. I can see the echoes in the
work of Kieslowski and Lynch and of course in Rivette's entire career. Insome ways, he's been playing off the experiments that began here.Check back in six months from now and maybe I could speak more
sensibly about Out 1.  But unquestionably it's great to have it presented
with such care and authority.</p>
<p>MR. ROBOT SEASON ONE  ($49.98 BluRay; Universal)
TRUE DETECTIVE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON  ($79.98 BluRay;
HBO)
It's fun being the coolest new show on the block. But how long will it
last? For the moment, perhaps no TV show is snazzier than Mr. Robot . It
tapped into the zeitgeist with an overwhelming sense of paranoia and thebelief that privacy is a myth. (Belief? Make that fact.) Rami Malek was theunlikely lead. I'd found him an interesting if somewhat opaque actor insupporting roles but wondered who the heck thought he should be the
lead of a TV show. So what do I know? Malek's opaqueness is part of his
appeal (he has an air of mystery rare in the open-faced new Hollywood ofeasy access to a celeb's every thought). And that uncertainty is absolutelyessential to the balancing act Mr. Robot pulled off in its first season. For
most of the season, we don't know exactly how nuts his character might
or might not be. Literally nuts. Certain episodes chimed in with theheadlines, making Mr. Robot  seem even more timely. (The season finale
was even delayed due to unfortunate echoes of real life.) And now thehard part begins. Launching a series is hard. Launching a potentially greatseries is harder. Fulfilling that promise of course is even harder. So dive in
now because season two can't come soon enough.
Of course, True Detective  might tell the paranoid series Mr. Robot to
watch its back. Get dubbed the hottest show on TV and people will come
gunning for you. That's surely the feeling they have on this series. Season
One was praised to high heaven. Unlike the continuing series Mr. Robot,True Detective  has self-contained seasons, storylines with beginnings and
middles and ends. Season Two starts from scratch with a new cast and
has to win your trust all over again. Rather remarkably, True Detective</p>
<p>failed to do so in spectacular fashion. Not since Season Two of Friday
Night Lights  dove off a cliff with a ludicrous storyline has a series
squandered so much goodwill so quickly. The folks at TD  probably blame
that target on their backs, ignoring the many shows that get acclaim and
keep it (The Sopranos, Hill Street Blues, The Wire, Mad Men, Breaking Bad
and so on.) The fact is that season two really pretty silly. Watch it and
you're more likely to downgrade your feelings about season one than say,hey, it's not that bad! I'm still rooting for/waiting for Vince Vaughan to getback on top, but this wasn't it.</p>
<p>STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON  ($34.98 BluRay combo; Universal)
STONEWALL  ($19.98 DVD; Lionsgate)
The Oscars may be stupid enough to ignore one of the most critically
acclaimed and popular films of the year, but we're not! The truth is thatthe Academy Awards loves underdogs, but they usually prefer the
sacrificial lamb sorts, like Meryl Streep in Silkwood  or Tom Hanks in
Philadelphia . Young black men who gain swagger and success by rapping
bluntly and explicitly about their life? Not so much. And most Academy
voters have never even heard of the legendary group N.W.A., much less
heard their music. So given the film's success and raves, sure it
"deserved" to be in the mix at this year's Oscars. (I put deserved inquotes because no movie "deserves" an Oscar nomination and an Oscarnomination or win has absolutely NOTHING to do with quality, much as
they'd like to think so.) But one can easily understand why Selma  and 12
Years A Slave  were much more Oscar's cup of tea. Polite and noble?
Great. Foul-mouthed and funny? Not so much. The controversy does
have one positive side: maybe even more people will take the time tocheck out this film and learn about one of the most influential acts inmusic history, not to mention perhaps gaining some understanding of
gangsta rap and why it took off and what it actually meant and still
means to its fans.
Stonewall  faced a worse controversy than not getting Oscar nominations:
indifference. It also got tarred with the usual accusation of white-washing
history. It uses the backdrop of the Stonewall riots to tell the usual tale ofa (hot) gay kid from the sticks coming to Greenwich Village and finding
himself, though not before a lot of creepy older men find him and offer
money in exchange for his soul. It's terrible history, but movies aren'tmeant to be history. They are, however, meant to be entertaining and
Stonewall  feels more dated than dangerous or (god forbid) debauched. If
it had been made in 1980 or 1970, this film would make perfect sense.
Coming out in 2015, about the nicest thing one can say is that directorRoland Emmerich had good intentions and clearly did everything in his
power to deliver the best, most widely appealing film possible. But so
often, you find a wider audience by being true to yourself: that's the realgenius of Straight Outta Compton.</p>
<p>THE LOOK OF SILENCE  ($29.93 BluRay; Cinedigm)
LET THERE BE LIGHT  ($29.95 BluRay; Olive)
The Look Of Silence  is one of the best films of 2015. it's a companion
piece to director Joshua Oppenheimer's brilliant The Act Of Killing.  But it's
almost difficult to believe they were made by the same person. Both
movies illuminate the crimes against humanity that took place in
Indonesia, crimes that remain unpunished to this day. The Act Of Killingpushed the envelope for documentaries, to say the least. SomehowOppenheimer talked those who had taken part into reenacting their
crimes...in the style of various movie genres, like crime flicks and</p>
<p>musicals. The result is even nuttier than it sounds. Now with The Look Of
Silence  we get the flip side: an absolutely traditional, straightforward,
deeply compelling and unsettling look at the same subject. It's hero is an
optometrist who lives in the same community with people who killed ororchestrated the death of countless people, including his brother. On
camera, he calmly meets with these officials (they are in power, hence the
lack of shame or fear of justice). He tests their eyes -- the nominal reasonfor the visit -- and then confronts them about the role they played. He is
ignored, threatened, tearfully pleaded with, argued with and it's all just as
compelling as any thriller. The credits are filled with people who workedon the film but in fear of reprisals asked their names to be left out. Iliterally fear the man's life and every time the film comes up, I gingerly
check online to see if his death has been reported. So far, so good.
Justice of course, is another matter entirely.
Director John Huston's work brings another crime to light: the brutality of
even a just war. No one doubts the necessity of World War II (though the
way civilians became acceptable targets for both sides certainly can andshould be debated more). Huston dove in wholeheartedly, making a
series of films for the Army. This BluRay collects four works and as it
attests, shows Huston's transformation from war booster to somethingmore complicated and humane. It begins with a flag-waving shortnarrated by Jimmy Stewart. Then we get Report From The Aleutians,
which captures the boredom of preparing for battle. Even this was
considered risky at the time. Huston really crossed the line with The BattleWith San Pietro,  which showed how a failure of intelligence could cost
American lives. Finally, it ends with Let There Be Light,  a disturbing and
revealing look at soldiers suffering what we now recognize as PTSD. Atthe time, the suggestion of this was seen as a sign of weakness at bestand unpatriotic at worst. Of course, Huston had as much gravitas and
authority as any General. They didn't try and get him to change these
movies. They just buried them deep. We can only be thankful they weren'tdestroyed. As a record of a major director actually coming to grips with
war and its aftermath, this is a unique, fascinating chapter in Huston's
career.</p>
<p>THE MARTIAN  ($39.99 BluRay; 20th Century Fox)
SICARIO  ($39.98 BluRay; Lionsgate)
EXPERIMENTER  ($29.98 BluRay; Magnolia)
EVEREST  ($44.98 BluRay; Universal)
Ok, now I'm going to get testy. I have many friends who absolutely loved
The Martian.  I suppose I understand why; it has an inherent appeal and
stars the very appealing Matt Damon. But to me it's clearly an inferior spin
on Gravity  which was itself an inferior spin on the much better movie
Apollo 13 . Among its many failings is the film's inability to suggest the
passage of time. Damon's astronaut is stranded and alone on Mars,literally out of touch with the rest of humanity for months at a time. But in</p>
<p>the movie it feels like maybe at most a few weeks have passed. Damon
constantly finds a problem to be solved...and then immediately solves it.
At least we get to spend a great deal of time with Damon. Unlike Apollo
13, the scenes on earth are by far the worst. Jeff Daniels is asked to
behave absurdly as the head of NASA taking questions from reporters ina style that is movie-silly and shouldn't pass a test for believability from
even the most innocent audience. Indeed, everything that happens on the
ground is pretty godawful, dramatically speaking, from the manyconferences about what to do about a stranded astronaut to thedreadfully boring ending. Are you upset Straight Outta Compton got
ignored? I'm more upset by the acclaim and Oscar noms for this subpar
film. Yet that's silly since Oscars have nothing to do with "the best filmsof the year" and given this movie's actual acclaim from critics not named
Michael and its popular appeal, it makes perfect sense that it would be
showered with attention.
Sicario  on the other hand slipped through the cracks. It's a would-be
drama hoping to wake us up to the corruption of the drug trade and the
people who cynically, perhaps half-heartedly try to tamp it down. It's anexpose in search of something new to expose, since we already know  the
drug trade has a corrupting influence on everyone forced in contact with
it, from border guards to the CIA to honest good folk caught in the
middle. Everything this movie reveals has been seen many times beforeand more effectively. It doesn't help that our way in is an FBI agent played
by Emily Blunt. Her character behaves so foolishly so often you start to
root against her. The manly man cynic Josh Brolin and the mysteriouscharacter portrayed by Benicio Del Toro are marginally more likable
because they aren't patsies. Yet the machinations they engage in are so
silly in their desire to "shock" that you giggle instead of gasp at everytwist. The only positives here are the sweeping birds-eye cinematographyof Roger Deakins and the moody score by Jóhann Jóhannsson.
On the plus side, Experimenter  is the latest interesting addition to the
body of work by director Michael Almereyda. Documentaries, shorts, an
episode of Deadwood , Shakespeare (Ethan Hawke's intriguing Hamlet) --
Almereyda has done it all. Here he tackles the famed social experimentconducted at Yale in 1961 in which volunteers believed they weredelivering painful shocks to patients simply because someone in a whitecoat (ie. a figure of authority) told them to do so. Peter Sarsgaard as the
Experimenter is right in sync with the director's subtle, complex
worldview and it's nice to see Winona Ryder delivering another good,you-know-I-can-act-don't-you? performance as his wife. It's not great,
but it's intelligent, interesting and ripe for discovery.
Everest , unfortunately, is perhaps not the best movie to see at home. Sure</p>
<p>you've got a widescreen TV and some cool sound. (Or at least, lucky you
if you do.) Even so, a spectacle like this benefits the most from being
seen in a movie theater. Sure, it's not just a spectacle thanks to a solid
cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal. But the main appeal is the sense of dangerand realism surrounding this depiction of a doomed real-life expedition in1996. I can't get into the many arguments about what really happened
and who deserves blame, if anyone. Watching it on a small screen, you
probably won't even care. Sometimes, waiting for BluRay (or VOD orNetflix) just isn't the right call.
THE COMPLETE LADY SNOWBLOOD  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion)
If it wasn't for Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill,  I would have never heard of this
early 1970s revenge classic. His movie paid obvious homage toSnowblood  and as is Tarantino's wont, he urged everyone to check it out.
Now finally we can in a print that does justice to it. This Criterion release
contains the original and the sequel, looking better than ever. Watch out
for that umbrella! Lady Snowblood is a young woman determined to getrevenge against the dishonorable thugs who killed her father and brotherand raped her mother. And by god she gets it, beautifully. The sequel is
less interesting but is good to have here. The extras are modest but the
care with which it's presented, from of course the print itself to thegorgeous artwork on the box itself is evident throughout. It's a career
high for everyone involved, though the star Meiko Kaji is still around and
still acting regularly, so who knows? Maybe 20 years from now Criterionwill release some other work in which she shines.</p>
<p>PARTY OF FIVE COMPLETE SERIES  ($69.98 DVD; Mill Creek)
LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE SEASON EIGHT  ($21.98 DVD;
Lionsgate)
This problem is only going to get worse. What problem? The problem of
getting access to your favorite TV shows in complete, satisfying sets.
Boxed sets come out but don't include all the original music. Individual
seasons are released one by one but before they're done someone goes</p>
<p>and releases a complete boxed set, making you feel like a fool for buying
each one instead of waiting. Or you get one or two seasons...and then
nothing. (I'm looking at you, St. Elsewhere. ) Why will it get worse?
Because there's so much damn television being created. Streaming is
taking over, so studios are losing interest in physical product like boxed
sets. Thank god some are still coming out.
Here for example is Party Of Five. After some individual seasons came
out, they stopped. At least now finally we get the entire series. These are
the broadcast episodes, uncut. However, it seems music rights weren't
cleared so we get a lot of cues that aren't what were originally played.This is maddening, though often I'd argue in the 1990s that the musiccues popping up in these shows did to a degree become somewhat
random. I'm just glad a show that obviously isn't one of the greats but
boasted an excellent cast is available in some form. It's cheap, it's
cheaply packaged, but by god it's the entire series.
Little House On The Prairie  has had an even more convoluted path to
release. We've had individual seasons in DVD and BLuRay, then seasons
remastered on DVD, then a complete boxed set and then remastered on
BluRay and so on and so forth. Some poor bastards have an almost
complete set of BluRays but are waiting for the last two. (And those TVmovies!) Here's the uncut season eight on DVD in nicely remastered
picture and sound. No BluRay in sight yet, but hey, if you bought season
1-7 on DVD, you're gonna want this. It's too late to wish for commonsense. Virtually no one who cares about LHOTP  wants just a season or
two. They want the whole series. I'm not even sure what the commercial
reason is for turning out individual seasons at this point, though again, if
you bought 1-7, well I know why YOU want it. The quiet charms ofSeason One are long gone, of course and by now LHOTP  is just a soap
with so many plot twists it puts to shame the simple plots and insights ofthe original books. BUt it sure looks good.</p>
<p>HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2  ($38.99 BluRay; Sony)
The death of Adam Sandler has been greatly exaggerated. He's received
Razzies for his work on The Cobbler. His Netflix western comedy TheRidiculous 6  got terrible reviews. (No one knows how popular it's been
except for the folks at Netflix and they ain't talking.) And the would-be
franchise Pixels  got terrible reviews (though ok box office). But I'm happy
to point out the obvious: Sandler has become MORE of a worldwide box
office draw in the past ten years. (That's rare for comedy, which doesn'ttravel as well as action.) The good news continues for him with this
animated sequel. It actually improves on the modest quality of the
original, with a snappier story and better voice work all around. Needlessto say, like most of his work it's harmless and sweet in intent,championing the offbeat and the oddball. And it was an even bigger hit
than the first one. Watch it with your kids and you'll be pleasantly
surprised. So yes, expect a Hotel Transylvania 3  and a lot more movies
from Sandler. He's not done yet.</p>
<p>THE UNDESIRABLE  ($29.95 BluRay; Olive)
My favorite director of all time is Michael Curtiz. He embodies the classic
Hollywood system and rivals Howard Hawks for the record of more greatmovies in more genres than anyone else in history. Great pirate flick?Captain Blood  or The Sea Hawk.  Great musical? Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Great western? Dodge City,  perhaps. Great woman's film? Mildred Pierce.
Great costumer? The Private Lives Of Elizabeth & Essex. Great familyfilm? Life With Father  or Four Daughters.  Great gangster flick with a heart
of gold? Angels With Dirty Faces . Oh and here are two more. Great
adventure? The Adventures of Robin Hood.  And just plain greatest film of
all time? Casablanca .
So if Curtiz directed it, I want to see it. And now finally, we get to see one
of his unsung masterpeices. The silent Hungarian film The Undesirable
was thought lost for good, but turned up in a basement in NYC. It's beenfully restored and given a new score, fitting tribute to Hungary's greatest
director. I'm almost a little wary of seeing it: I want it to be great, not just
a good flick. Obviously, Curtiz delivered the goods or wouldn't have madethe leap to Hollywood. On the other hand, if it's really good, I'll be all the
sadder to realize how many of his early films are truly lost for good. I've
checked out the image and score: they're all you could hope given themovie's relatively obscure nature. It's here, presented in as good acondition as possible. Given the swamp of titles that come out every
week, it's hard to know what to watch first. Sometimes, however, I know I
want to wait. It's a treat to know there's a "new" Michael Curtiz film forme to savor. Can I add it to the list above, tossing in "great silent film?"
Soon, I'll know.</p>
