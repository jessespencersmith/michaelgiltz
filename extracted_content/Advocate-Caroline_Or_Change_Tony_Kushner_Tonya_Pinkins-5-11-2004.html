            <p>ierce. That's how people de­
scribe Tonya Pinkins in Tony 
Kushner and Jeanine Tesori's 
bold musical Caroline, Or 
Change. Drawing on Kushner's 
childhood memories of Louisiana, the 
show tells the simple story of the emo­
tionally needy son of a white Jewish 
family and the emotionally shut-down 
African-American maid he tries to be­
friend. In some ways it's the anti-Driv­
ing Miss Daisy because it offers no 
false moment when Caroline lets the 
boy think of himself as her friend 
rather than her boss. 
"I'm so glad they didn't do that," Pin­
kins says, "because it's such a myth. I 
know for Jeanine [the show's compos­
er], there was a moment when her 
babysitter-who she thinks of as a 
member of her family-took Jeanine 
up to Harlem to meet her own family 
and introduced her as her boss. Jeanine 
was devastated. She told Tony about it, 
and he said, 'Well, you're her boss.'" 
Nevertheless, Caroline is bursting 
with passion when all alone-she's ser­
enaded at times by the washer and 
dryer, not to mention the moon-and Pinkins's performance has theatergoers 
clamoring to get in: After an extended 
run at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, 
Caroline moves to Broadway for a May 
2 opening at the O'Neill Theater. 
"One of the hardest things for me is, 
What is this woman's arc?" says Pinkins. 
"Is it a tragedy, or is it hopeful? [Direc­
tor] George [Wolfe] helped me really un­
derstand what that arc was and why she 
was not defeated at the end." 
For playwright Kushner, Caroline 
began as an even more radical depar­
ture: an opera. "I wrote it for Bobby 
McFerrin [to compose the music]," 
he says. "But he didn't like it. I'd 
shown it to George Wolfe, and he 
said he wanted to do it with theater 
people, that it needed to be acted ... to 
be understood." 
The actor Wolfe had in mind was 
Pinkins, who won a Tony under his di­
rection in Jelly's Last Jam only to have 
her life unravel over a bitter, protracted 
custody battle. As her own lawyer she 
developed a defense that inspired arti­
cles in law journals, eventually regain­
ing custody of her children. Along the 
way, she founded Operation Z, an orga-
THE ADVOCATE 1801 MAY 11, 2004 nization promoting zero tolerance of vi­
olence against women and children. 
Pinkins has also just re-signed with 
ABC's All My Children, where she 
plays lawyer Olivia Frye. But she 
couldn't ignore a call from Wolfe. "I've 
known [George] for a really long time, 
so he and I have a kind of wordless 
communication," says Pinkins. "He is a 
master psychologist. He knows how to 
speak to each actor according to their 
temperament. " 
Audiences get to witness Pinkins's 
singing her heart out on "Lot's Wife," a 
second-act tour de force so powerful 
that it had to be modulated so that the 
rest of the musical wouldn't seem like a 
letdown. "I love that song, and it took us 
a really long time to create it," Pinkins 
comments. "In fact, we went into pre­
views at the Public with it unorchestrat­
ed because it was that new." 
It's an indelible moment-a cry from 
the heart of a woman who would never 
let anyone see her tears over her deci­
sion to remain "merely" a maid so that 
her sometimes ungrateful children can 
get ahead. "For Caroline," says Pinkins, 
"it is a heroic choice." •</p>
