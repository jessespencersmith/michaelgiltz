11/01/2004 02:04:00 PMFor a year, I've been preaching that Bush has no natural base ofsupport -- he hasn't satisfied the power-mad religious right (hencePat Robertson's public dig at Bush), he has infuriated fiscalconservatives with his free-spending ways and he's dismayed strong-on-defense conservatives by ignoring the advice of his top militaryadvisers almost every step of the way and bungling the peace in Iraq.So why am I suddenly freaking out all over again? Some polls showBush gaining ground from last weekend to this -- God knows why.And the constant drumbeat that the election is thisclose has medoubting my belief that 10 million new registered voters, waves ofyoung people who can't be polled (cell phones) and who favor Kerryto a strong degree, and the expected high turnout (which is alwaysbad for an incumbent) are maybe not enough.DON'T YOU DARE GO TO THE POLLS ALONE. If you go alone, you arewasting an opportunity. Go before work and stay as long as it takesto vote and BRING A FRIEND. Talk to coworkers today about meetingup at the polls and grabbing a coffee or doughnut to stand in line. It'smore fun and you'll make sure that even the people who swearthey're gonna vote actually vote. Then take more friends on yourlunch break on Tuesday. (They don't know you're just going along forthe fun.) Then badger more friends to meet you after work at thepolls as well. TURNOUT. TURNOUT. TURNOUT. The higher the turnout,the better for Kerry. Pollsters are giddy with the possibility that 60%of eligible voters might actually vote, an extremely high number. Butanyone who DOESN'T vote should be ashamed of themselves. Sinceyou're reading this blog, you're already a lot more informed andinvolved and passionate than most people and you HAVE to light afire under those who care but can get too busy to bother.I don't mind being scared on Monday and Tuesday. I just don't wantto be scared on Wednesday. Somebody tell me we're gonna win.
