ctor Jason Lee is promoting his new fmily fllm
"Alvin and the Chipmunks" (opening Friday),
and that means being griled by the media For
the moment, the media is represented by three
middle-school girls from Long Island who've
won the opportunity to intereiew the acton
Armed with glasses of milk, they pepper Lee
with questions, and though they know him from his
voice work in the movies "Underdog" and "The ./
Incredibles," they're unaware that he appar-
ently is on some Tv show called "My Name
Is Earl-"
'You've never seen it?" asks I€e Politely.
"You should watch it sometime lt's a really
good show."
The entire scene is sweet, just like the
family fiIm he's promoting and indeed just
like the 37-year-old Califomia native's entire
careef, Since his wry but kind-eyed breakout in di
rector Kevin Smith's movies, he's always sought or rector Kevin Smith's movies, he's always sought out good
karma by seeking out good roles.
In "Alvin," t€e plays Dave Seville, the human straight
man to the titular rodents. In this CGI-sPiked update' a
struBgling musician whose lite gets turned upside dom
when three talking, singing chipmunks - Simon, The-
odore and Alvin - pop up in his life. They become pop
sensations when Dave writes them a holiday tune called"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late) " There
is, of course, an evil record company executive (David
Cross) who must be thwarted before Dave md the gang
figure out how to live as a family, though not before Dave
hollers "Alvin. Alvin! ALVIN! !!!"
The goodwill l€e brings.to the frlm is also evident on
his hit NBC sitcom "My Name Is Earl." Though it revolvesmustache, which gets annofng, as petty as that seem:

"Maybe it's a good thing that no matter how angry
I get, I'm still not the fierky guy]," he says. "Or maybe
itts a bad thing. Maybe it mems I would never be able
to play Bill the Butcher in 'Gangs of New York' or som
thing like that. Maybe the audiencejust wouldn't buy
Maybe people would just say, 'Oh, that's Earl.'"
For the moment, though, Lee is not Earl, since the
Miters strike has put TV shows on hiatus and given h
an unexpected vacation. A huge fan of road trips' he's
plaming to head out in pursuit of another of his pas'
iions: photography. And along the way, he'll probably
be listening to the band Midlake, a critically acclaime

he's been championing for years. Talking about Mid-
lake's driving tbrce - singer md sonBMiter Tim Smi
- Lee reveals what's important to himself as well, an
