            <p>T H U R S D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 2 ,  2 0 0 6"Dr. Who" Comes To Sci Fi!Finally! "Dr. Who" has already aired in the UK, Canada and the rest ofthe world to great success. But until now, it hasn't been seen in the U.S.But no need to buy a Tardis: The all-new edition of "Dr. Who" iscoming to SciFi Fridays this March at 9 p.m. where all 13 episodes --overseen by Russell T. Davies of "Queer As Folk" -- will air on SciFi'smost popular night for television.We're so far behind that the new Dr. -- Christopher Eccleston -- isalready the old Doctor. He declined to do a second run and has beenreplaced by David Tennant. Tennant made his debut as the Doctor onChristmas Day to good reviews. Every Doctor takes getting used to, butEccleston wore the part very well. I've seen most of the episodes whilein London. They do have better special effects on the odd occasion, butthe home-made feel of the original is still very much intact. I have toadmit, I got quite a jolt when that theme song struck up and I wasabout to see a new adventure. Great fun.It's been such a hit, the show has already spawned a spinoff starring thecharacter Captain Jack Harness, an American adventurer, if Iremember correctly. Called "Torchwood," it stars the terrific stage actorJohn Barrowman and is already in production. (Look for him in the lastfive episodes where he pops in regularly.)You'll enjoy it, but one word of warning. Since SciFi is squeezing theseepisodes into a one hour slot, they'll inevitably be shaving off a fewminutes. You'll have to wait for the DVDs before getting the fullexperience. Those DVDs -- once scheduled for February have now beenpushed back to July 4th.NOTE: TNB alerted me to the fact that "Dr. Who," unlike most Britishdramas, is only 45 minutes long, so the trims should be minimal.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 7:00 PM
