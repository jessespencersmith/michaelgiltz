~~(f -<"~i!Q Diaries . ***'/2 Focus, $29.99 
What a year for 
actor Gael Garcia 
Bernal. First he was 
the sexy center of 
Pedro Almodovar's 
noir "Bad ffitucation." 
Then he gave a 
soulful, leading man 
performance in this 
thoroughly 
entertaining look at 
the young Che 
Guevara. It's a very 
good look at one 
man's coming of age 
or -more exactly -
his coming of 
conscience. Extras 
include a making-of 
documentary and two 
interviews with 
~-= __ ~=-____ ~~~~ __ ~ Bernru. 
X: The Unheard Music 
*** Image, $1_9_.99 _____ _ 
Here's a reru time capsule: a 
raw, messy look at the seminru 
L.A. punk band X from 1985. You 
get a band biography of sorts 
and lots of random L.A. footage. 
But mostly you get X in concert 
at the height of its powers. For a 
perverse double bill, pair it with 
Hilary Duff's "American Idol"" 
ish flick "Raise Your Voice" 
(New Line, $27.95). 
Goodbye,Dnlgonlnn ***'!: Wellspring, $26.98 
Few movies bring to mind 
directors Yasujiro Ozu and 
Charlie Chaplin, but that's 
exactly the accomplishment of 
this gem A pensive look at the 
audience in a rundown Chinese 
movie pruace on its last night, 
this has ghosts (sort of), noisy 
patrons, a limping ticket taker, 
frustrated romance and the 
handsome projectionist they rul . 
long for. Easily director Tsai 
Ming-Liang's most accessible 
fIlm But that's a matter of degree 
-there isn't a line of diruogue 
until 45 minutes into the fIlm 
The Greatest 
American Hero: 
Season One **'/2 Anchor Bay, $29.98 
This goofy series about a high 
school teacher who stuinbles on a "super hero" suit seemed 
quite the hip, sophisticated 
show -when we were 12. It 
remains good-natured thanks 
to a plucky cast led by 
William Katt and Connie 
Sellecca. The clunky special 
effects only add to the 
enjoyment. Extras include the 
unaired pilot for "The 
Greatest American Heroine" 
spin-off. 
Donnie Darko: 
Director's Cut ***'/2 Fox,$26.98 
Writer-director Richard 
Kelly is proud of the 2001 
theatrical version of his cult 
classic. But this new take on 
"Darko" contains refined 
sound, extra scenes and new 
song cues. It doesn't 
supersede the original, says 
Kelly on the commentary 
track. Consider it a "remix." 
Also out: more disaffected 
youth in the 2001 Japanese 
cult hit ''All About Lily ChouÂ­
Chou" (HVE, $29.95).</p>
