More music from the Number One band of all time, the Beatles. (I guess it's safe to say Idol  won't
be getting approval for a night devoted to the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin anytime soon. What
would they say? Let's celebrate the #2 and #3 bands of all time?) They introduce the singers andno one gets even close to the screams of for David Archuleta. Actually, that's not true: Simon'sscreams comes pretty close. He can no longer be dubbed the judge America loves to hate. He's thejudge America loves to love because he's blunt and funny and usually right.
Amanda Overmyer  -- Sang "Back In The U.S.S.R.," an insanely catchy tune that gently sent up and
celebrated the Beach Boys and yet -- remarkably -- was never released as a single. (It's on the
bursting at the seams White Album, which depending on the day of the week may be my favoriteBeatles album of all.) If you're wondering how deep the Beatles catalog is, knowing this song wasn'teven a single is all the proof you need. (Chubby Checker had a modest hit with it.) Amanda beginsby trying to remember her favorite moment on Idol  so far, a waste of time that amounts to instant
nostalgia and which for most contestants amounts to simply replaying a clip from the previousweek or so. Then she does her Southern rock thing. To be fair, even more of the lyrics areintelligible this time and the song was pretty recognizable. But you can't help noticing how thin hervocals are. The judges are pretty polite and Paula offers the disastrous suggestion that Amandasing a ballad. Not a good idea.
Kristy Lee Cook  -- She tackles "You've Got To Hide
Your Love Away," one of the key mid-period tracks
(from the soundtrack to Help!) that proved the
Beatles weren't just going to pen silly love songs.
Cook chose it because she liked the title and was
apparently completely unfamiliar with it. Then shesings it and Kristy proves she's still unfamiliar with it.
Her arrangement turns it into a power ballad of some sort, she's rough on the low notes, loses themelody completely at one point and by the end the song doesn't even remotely resemble the

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 11: The Beatles
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_92255.html [4/5/2009 7:23:30 PM]original tune. All three judges drop the hammer on her and Simon says simply, "You're not a good
performer." Kristy rejoinders that she hopes to get back next week because -- she tells Simon -- "I
can blow you out of your socks and you know it!" To which Simon laughs and says, "Okay!" Ryan
keeps giggling over the unintended double entendre and Kristy finally catches on and looks
amused and embarrassed at the same time. More to the point, I watched the song again and kept in
mind that most people don't know the tune anyway so they won't notice or care how little it
resembles the original. And Kristy looked just great, clearly did a better job than the week before
and got to belt out a note or two. It might just be enough not to send her home. Still, vulnerable.
David Archuleta  -- Sang "The Long and Winding Road," which he correctly points out was the
last #1 single for the Beatles. (Ryan got it wrong last week and claimed it was "Let It Be.") And yes,
the Archuleta train is back on track. We now know he's fallible, which means his smooth, polished,
utterly professional and charming rendition of a tune that can be quite draggy in the wrong hands
was jut lovely. Randy said David should take more liberties but he's crazy -- the guy's worked withMariah Carey too long and thinks endless, pointless runs are what singers should do. David did agreat job and even looked abashed at the praise when he was done. He even looked like he mightcry, so they cut to a commercial just in time.
Michael Johns  -- Sang "Day In The Life" from Sgt. Pepper,  the very definition of an album track
(that is, a song that works beautifully on an album; sure it can be played on the radio but it belongs
where it belongs). Mashes up a Lennon verse drawing from newspaper stories and a McCartneyditty that blends in perfectly, topped up with an intense, orchestral meltdown. It seems a reallybizarre choice to pick when you've got less than two minutes to sing and will have to cut out mostof the song-- it would be like performing a truncated "Stairway to Heaven." And indeed, Johns getsthe worst of all worlds by cutting and pasting this song which simply HAS to be heard in itsentirety to make any emotional sense. His voice has a nice rasp to it at the beginning, but I thinkhe's messed up the lyrics early on. (It's hard to tell since the song is edited.) Then he really messesup the lyrics at the end, even mumbling for a moment to cover it up. Pretty disastrous. All threejudges drop the hammer. But bizarrely NONE of them mention the obvious fact that he forgot thelyrics. Then the recap at the end of the show replays that very same moment. Can it be that none ofthem know the song that well and didn't realize his mistake? He certainly looked like a deer in theheadlights when it was over and only his good looks (he's really the only mature male sex symbolsince Archuleta is very young and still very Tiger Beat, in a safe way) might save him. Veryvulnerable.
Brooke White  -- Sang "Here Comes The Sun," a George Harrison classic from Abbey Road  that I
will have played at my funeral (many, many years from now, hopefully). It seems like a smart
choice, but she botches it up miserably, including a too obvious yellow dress with layers that looksfrumpy. White seems not to trust this simple, lovely tune. She twirls around on stage, she bounces
too much and seems to speed it up, she dances awkwardly and generally behaves as if she believes
just singing the song would bore people to death. A train wreck, really. Everyone is pretty down,
though Paula says something or other nice. Simon then bizarrely blames the song -- not only is it
one of the absolute greats, it's definitely in what should be her singer-songwriter comfort zone. She
just blew it.
David Cook  -- Sang "Day Tripper" in a rocked-out version modeled somewhat on a cover by
Whitesnake. It was the b-side to the #1 hit "We Can Work It Out" and went to #5 itself. Very good
performance by Cook, despite a voice box interlude that brought up unnecessary memories of PeterFrampton. But overall, very solid. It's exactly what he should be doing. All three gave him credit,though Simon pointed out David's unfortunate tendency to look pleased with himself. (Cook mightbe the most modest guy on the planet; it's just the way he comes across on camera.)
Carly Smithson  -- Sang "Blackbird," another gem from the White Album.  (And really, if you
don't own Rubber Soul  and Revolver  and Abbey Road  and the White Album, then you can't claim
to love music.) Her rather dramatic rendition worked pretty well, though it was marred by an over-
active audience who squealed anytime she let out a little volume, as if "loud" equals "good. Randyand Paula were positive but Simon had some criticisms - again, he seemed to think the song wasbad! Carly's comeback in which she explained why the song was meaningful to her was veryeffective. Plus you got to see her seriously inked-up husband (you can barely see him behind all thetattoos) which I assume scares some of Middle America every week so it's cool to see her cheeredon by him, not covering her own serious tattoo and even proudly displaying a new one she got tocelebrate season seven.

Accused Of...Jason Castro  -- Sang "Michelle," one of Paul McCartney's world-class ballads, a Grammy winner
for Song Of the Year and yet another classic (off Rubber Soul ) that was never released as a single,
though several other artists charted with it in 1966. This is a perfect choice for Castro: light, gentle
and winning. The annoying audience again squeals just because he walks across the stage and claps
along too fast. He really does have a thin voice and sings out of the side of his mouth at times. The
judges are mixed but polite and really he has charm to spare and should be fine. Simon, by the way,
that wasn't a "French-English" version Castro sang, it's the original version. Is this another Beatles
tune he doesn't really know?
Syesha Mercado -- Sang "Yesterday," the #1 smash hit from the Help! soundtrack that has been
recorded more than 2500 times, perhaps more than any other song in history. Finally! Finally,
Syesha -- my crush - has a breakout moment. She's backed by a simple guitar (and later some
strings) but doesn't try to overpower the song. She sings it directly and beautifully and has a great
dress and killer earrings and looks wonderful and was just vulnerable and darn near perfect
(despite a little wavering at one point and a weak run at another). All three judges are very
positive, but not positive enough in my book. That song has been sung by everyone, so not boring
us to tears or actually making us feel it again is a big accomplishment.
Chikezie  -- Sang "I've Just Seen A Face" from Help! Since it worked the week before, Chikezie
decided to do it again and delivered a fairly identical arragment to the one he used last time. Not a
good idea. Personally, I liked the slow, soulful delivery he began with. Then Chikezie vamped it upwith a harmonica solo and a country-ish feel. Simon was right when he said it felt gimmicky. Notbad, but he can't pull this stunt again.
Ramiele Malubay  -- Sang "I Should Have Known Better" from A Hard Day's Night,  which is
exactly what it was for Ramielle. I've never been much of a fan, but to me she came off as a
complete amatuer, even on a night where a number of other singers stumbled. She was flat, off-keyand awful. (Oh yeah, and still cute as a dickens, but that won't cut it anymore.) None of the judgeswere positive, but they didn't trash her the way I expected. This was a "thanks very much, makesure you pack your bags" performance and they didn't treat it as such. But I think the viewers will.
The bottom three will be Michael Johns, Kristy Lee Cook and Ramiele Malubay and I believe
Ramiele is going home. What do you think?

So Amanda is gone. A biker nurse. What guy hasn't had that fantasy? That said, it was her time to go.
Every week, it was the same thing, three note songs. Her journey home started on 80's week when she
sang Joan Jett. She should have tried a Tina thing, but she didn't. In retrospect, I don't think she could.
She would have been better served if she knew any music beyond overplayed classic rock.

What kills me is that none of the singers have to play a guitar and sing at the same time. For pete's
sake how much easier can they make it for these kids?
If you're just going to stand there and sing then do something like " The Magical Mystery Tour", "Get
Back", " It's only love", or "Penny Lane".

It has been interesting to see how few of them take advantage of playing a musicalinstrument. Jason Castro, for one, always does better. I just don't think his guitar picking skillsare up to the task for the harder songs. You can bet Brooke White is going to anchor herselfto an instrument from now on, though. However, just standing there and singing isn't exactlyeasy -- especially on Beatles songs, which often had very intricate vocal arrangements thatgave them their appeal but which a solo singer can't duplicate.

David Archuleta manages to find himself a song that fits his voice and style instead of stretching
himself to fit a different type of song. He may be doing Dean Martin imitations the rest of his life at thisrate. I would like to see him try something like " Mother Natures Son" from the white Album and sing itstraight. (not so much vibrato David) He ought to be able to do that.

Damn it, Michael! Now you've even got me watching this stupid show! I own all the Beatles CDs and socan't resist a show like this.
Where to begin, oh boy!
First, " I've just seen a face" IS a country song and perhaps that's why there was an attempt to sing it
that way. Go back and listen to George Harrison bang away on his Gretch Country Gentleman duringthe solo and he sounds just like Hank Williams, Chet Atkins, and the rest of the cowboys. This is a hardsong to do right and he shouldn't have tried it.
Second, "Here comes the sun" is as much about happily spinning around in a yellow dress as it is
about good riddens to the winter that has just passed away and how cold it was. I really had noproblem with her because the judges keep telling the singers to take the basic song and put YOU into itand stretch so I thought that's what she was doing. 
"You've got to hide your love away" is a slow painful lament by John Lennon who seems to be hurting
over a lost love. I would have kicked Kristy Lee off since this is one of my favorite Beatles songs and
she didn't even come close to sounding mournful. This is an easy song and she should have been able
to really nail it.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Ha! You're hooked. You're right, "Ive Just Seen A Face" does have a country twang in theoriginal, And anyone who knows "You've Got To Hide Your Love Away" would have foundKristy's performance godawful. But once I realized most people DIDN'T know it and listenedto the song again the way they might, I figured it had enough "Idol" moments (big notes and abig finish) and she looked so good that it would keep her safe. Since I was disastrouslywrong about all my other predictions, I'll trumpet this one again. Frankly, none of the Beatles
songs are easy to sing -- Yesterday seems simple but in fact delivering it style ain't easy. The
Long and Winding Road is a tune that's a snoozer when performed by almost anyone else so
again the fact that Archuleta did it well (just like he did with imagine) is very notable in my
book. He is very very young and has already outgrown most of the vocal flourishes and diva-like singing you see him indulge in on clips from Star Search when he was 13. If he keepsimproving, he'll be tremendous at 22. And hey, Dean Martin was a hell of a singer. Thanks forreading. Since next week ain't the Beatles, maybe you'll be able to walk away now from theshow.

Corrections on Beatles factoids for Guitarsandmore:
No Gretch Country Gentleman playing on I've Just Seen A Face. In fact, no electric guitars of
any sort on the recording. (And not to mention, Hank Williams wasn't exactly known for hissolo playing so that comparison is off base.)
Oh Darling is a McCartney tune through and through. Lennon had nothing to do with it.
Guitarsandmore See Profile  I'm a Fan of Guitarsandmore  permalink
I stand corrected and am not too proud to admit when I am wrong. There is a solo
after the bridge in "All my loving" that sounds very country and that"s the one I amremembering, but you are correct "I"ve just seen a face" is all acoustic. I had to goback and listen to it twice to believe it and you are right.
As far as "Oh Darling!" is concerned I was lectured intensely by another Beatles
fan/performer for a week about how that song was all John Lennon but Wikipedia
seems to agree with you. It is a real screamer though and I would like to hear
someone try it; that one and "Golden Slumbers".

About last night: it sucked, basically. Michael should be coming off much stronger and he should be
using some creativity by now. Poor Chikezie, I loved him last week. I also thought of Frampton whenCook did his number, but I still love "Frampton Comes Alive!," great summertime album for me. I'm stillnot crazy about any of the girls, and I hope Kristy goes tonight; although I have a feeling it could beStudboy (Michael.)

It was a pretty weak night. Not because they did the Beatles again. (The Beatles have plentyof classics) but because so many of the Beatles songs are more challenging than they seem.Day in the Life is a disastrous tune to try and squeese into 90 seconds, for example. Thevoice box was a bizarre choice and certainly brings up frampton but I didn't mean to implyFrampton Comes Alive isn't fun.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_92255.html [4/5/2009 7:23:30 PM]
another great summary of the show. I'm mostly on point with all your observations. Here's my take:
My favorite: 
1. Syesha- Yes, at last a great performance from her! She looked fantastic and very confortable on
stage. I'm going to buy this on Itunes and she'll have no problem staying on for next week.
2. David C- I like this guy. He sang the song really well, and he's doing his thing. He's taking it one
song at a time and thats a good thing. He does look a little self satisfied on the stage but who cares atleast he's being himself. I really think he can go all the way, possibly even waylay the Archuleta train ifhe keeps doing his thing and gives a adult/rocking alternative each week.
3. David A- well the little man is back on the horse. I don't bother voting for him since 30 million tweens
already do but he was very smooth. And he got back what he does so well, singing slow -tempo'edsongs where he can nuance and feel a song to great effect. Not one of my favorites as a singeranymore but he sang well.
Non faves:
1. Kristy- please someone give her a ticket outta here! I gotta agree with Simon, she's not a good
performer, she looks like an android up there, albeit a very pretty one.
2. Michael J- I really thought he would be doing well, but each week it just gets worse. Me and my
friends hooted when Paula said that thing about the ear piece. Whoa, embarrassing.
I think Kristy is out. I hope its not Ramiele, she's too cute to kick off and she does have a good voice,
she just hasn't chosen a good song for her yet. Don't give up on her!

Thanks for reading. I think we're seeing why Michael Johns didn't have success when hisband was signed to maverick. He has a good voice and certainly looks like a rocker. He justcan't deliver consistently. Would be a good runway model, though.

thanks Mr. Giltz to actually responding to the readers. Well we all know Amanda gotthe boot. But I agree Michael is just not cutting it. People memories of "BohemianRhapsody" are fading being replaced with mediocre performances week after week.I do like the guy, he's pretty humble and takes the criticism well plus all my co-workers (the female ones at least) think he's good looking so maybe that will beenough for him to coast thru.

The only two performances I really liked were David Archuletta's and David Cook's. I think with DavidCook, Simon just didn't like that version of the song, but I LOVED it! And as far as looking cocky - Ithink he was just grooving on that sexy version of the song and rocking out! I'm youtubing that one forsure! Black Bird was okay - but that's such a lovely gentle song, I really think Carly hit it too heavy and Ididn't really like the interpretation. Syesha did a lovely interpretation of a song that to me is kindofboring - but I wish she'd brought it down about 1/2 key or so, as she seemed flat the whole song.
Everybody else sucked! 
A vocal coach should really work with Jason on his support. He seems to sing from his throat and neck
instead of his diaphragm. And everybody except the two Davids sounded really off pitch last night. As aclassically trained singer - that's my biggest pet peeve!

I went back and forth on whether I thoght Syesha started the song at too high a pitch. Butyou're right about Castro sounding so thin -- maybe it's something as simple as him notknowing how to sing from the diaphragm, though improving that certainly won't make him agood singer, just not as weak a one. Yep, it's always bizarre when you get down to 10 singersfrom literally 100,000 auditions and you still wind up with some who just can't sing decentlyand you think, how the heck did they get in there?

Michael, my assessment of the night is virtually identical to yours but please allow me to pile on for a
moment because there were a few instances that deserve just that:
First, Simon's inane suggestion that the song wasn't good? I'm hoping that he 'meant' that the song
wasn't a good choice for that particular person. None of those great songs seemed to suffer at all when
the Beatles released them. Coincidence? I think not.
Secondly, Brooke White's total destruction of "Here Comes the Sun" was actually painful for me to
listen to. I had no idea there was an annoying Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm version but I hope tonever hear it again. Then her little verbal song and dance during her after-song critique (she's back-
peddling so hard she even cuts Simon off) made me realize just how much she's bought into her
previous praise. This is never a good sign. If you believe that everything you do will be touched by gold(and you're shocked when it isn't) then you're delusional and are not working hard enough to supportwhatever talent you have. I don't believe she's as good as she thinks she is. Not by a long shot.
Thirdly, as Paula was making the 'ear bud monitor' excuse for Michael Johns, he stood there very
stoically and let her speak without jumping in to clarify the matter. It wasn't until Ryan walked over anddid a bit of investigating that it was revealed that he had no ear buds and forced Paula into a quickcritical back flip. Even so, there is little excuse for condensing a song that cannot be Reader'sDigested.
Finally, as too seriously as Brooke White has begun taking herself, Jason Castro seems to think that
everything is a throw away. I thought he was going to bust out laughing during the French part like
some stoner who just realizes they ate a half gallon of chocolate chip ice cream in one sitting. Charm is
still carrying his day but I can't see that lasting unless he actually delivers.

I think (hope) Simon actually meant bad songs for those singers. He may be an idiot when it
comes to Dylan (doesn't like him) but I don't think he could actually dismiss tunes by theBeatles. Good points all around. Michael Johns blew a good chance to have a funny,disarming moment but got "caught" instead of speaking up. By the way, Paula's wrong aboutnot using an ear monitor meaning no excuses: they're used to make your life easier notharder so while they take get used t, not using them doesn't mean it's easier to sing on stagewithout them -- just a different challenge. And why would Michael just be getting used tothem? His band was on Madonna's Maverick label so he might have had opportunities beforeIdol to use one.

I would like to see Kristy Lee Cook go home tonight. At least the other singers that did bad last nighthave personalites when on stage. Kristy Lee Cook looks awkward when on the big stage.

You might get your wish. I think she's very vulnerable. Any time all three judges criticizesomeone, they are thisclose to going home.
