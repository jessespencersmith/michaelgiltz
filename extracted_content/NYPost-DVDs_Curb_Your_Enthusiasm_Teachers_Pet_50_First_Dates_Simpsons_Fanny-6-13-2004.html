***1/2 HBO;$39.98 
Larry David's cringe-inducing comedy 
gets better with every viewing, and is 
just one of many groundbreaking shows 
out on DVD this week. Also look for 
"Monk -Season One" (Universal; 
$59.98) and "Nip/'fuck -First Season" 
(Warner Bros.; $59.98). 
Teacher's Pet 
*** Disney; $29.99 
This animated flick about a dog who 
wants to be a boy got decent reviews but 
disappeared quickly. Fun cast (Kelsey 
Grammer, Paul Reubens and Nathan 
Lane) and extras will please both kids and 
older folks. 
50 First Dates 
* Columbia TriStar; $28.95 
Drew Barrymore has an extremely short­
term memory, so Adam Sandler has to 
woo her again every day. Lots of juvenile 
cheap laughs keep it mean-spirited. 
Think of this as "50 Bad First Dates." The Simpsons: The COmplete 
Fourth Season 
**** Fox; $49.98 
",f­
This is when the most successful comed.¥~~ 
of all time really hit its stride. "A Streetcar,· 
Named Marge," "Last Exit to Springfield'L: 
and "Krusty Gets Canceled" are just a f~w 
of the classic episodes that cemented.the_1 
show's reputation. Extras include I ,. j! ; 
commentary on every episode, deletedf,u(! 
scenes and more. . .rj
