8/24/2005 10:05:00 PMA good broadside at Karl Rove and Scooter and Cheney fromRepublican and Reagan official Tom Pauken. (Thanks to readersjustme and the truth for pointing us to this.) He says it comesdown to those forged documents pretending Hussein was tryingto get uranium in Niger.The worst possible scenario for the administration would beif it turns out that the Niger documents in question (whichall now agree were forged) were fabricated by individualswho may have had a motive for getting us into the war.Shadowy figures previously linked to the Iran-Contrascandal have been mentioned as possible originators of theforged documents. If there is any truth to these charges,the lid will blow off Washington Â? and the Bushadministration will be history.
