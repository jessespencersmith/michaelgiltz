8/08/2005 02:30:00 PMWriter John H. Richardson has a fascinating op-ed column fromthe Sunday New York Times detailing how his own father wasouted as a CIA agent in 1963 -- thus endangering nationalsecurity -- because he wouldn't support encouraging a coupagainst the South Vietnamese president.But in a horrible way, time proved him right. We never didpull off the magic trick of finding a foreign proxy who wasboth strong and obedient, and that meant that we ownedwhat we had broken. Fifty-eight thousand dead Americanslater, it seemed safe to conclude one thing: When "highofficial sources" start exposing C.I.A. officers to forcetheir agenda, watch out.One more sad parallel between Vietnam and Iraq, courtesy of KarlRove.
