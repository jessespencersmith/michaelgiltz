the Piano, the captivating story of the 1958 international piano

American musician showed the potential of art to change the world.April of 1958--the Iron Curtain was at its heaviest, and the outcome of theTchaikovsky International Piano Competition seemed preordained.
Nonetheless, as star musicians from across the globe descended on
Moscow, an unlikely favorite emerged: Van Cliburn, a polite, lanky Texanwhose passionate virtuosity captured the Russian spirit. This is the story ofwhat unfolded that spring--for Cliburn and the other competitors, jurors,party officials, and citizens of the world who were touched by the

What We Say
In 1958, pianist Van Cliburn electrified the world by going behind the Iron Curtain and triumphing at a piano competition.
Since shady scoring still happens today at international sporting events, you can imagine how unlikely that was at theheight of the Cold War. Writer Stuart Isacoff -- the founder of the magazine Piano Today -- tells the story, covering Van
Cliburn's unlikely artistic career and the repercussions of that remarkable event. The narrative he presents is interesting
and surely as thorough as we're likely to get. Isacoff is on firm ground when detailing the state of cultural exchangebetween the Soviet Union and the West in the 1950s and beyond. He is on less firm ground when detailing Cliburn'sShare This Book

<p>eccentric private life, surely in great part because the late, mostly closeted Cliburn was not terribly forthcoming, given the
world he grew up in. A tighter focus on the competition itself might have been better. As it is, we're often brought up short
by the presentation of material. The mania of Russian fans for Cliburn is detailed before Isakoff describes even the first
round of competition and how he did -- thus giving us the effect before the cause, which is confusing, to say the least.People are going nuts and he hasn't touched a key yet, as far as we know. Later, Cliburn becomes addicted to the drugspeddled by "Dr. Feelgood" and Isakoff eventually dismisses this scandal by mentioning that the doctor would have his licenserevoked years later in 1975. (Which left a good decade for the effects of his prescriptions to be felt, though it's never
mentioned again. The doctor's downfall also led a few years later to Van Cliburn's decade-long absence from performing, a
point worth exploring. Instead, Isakoff leaps over this decade-long gap rather quickly.) Isakoff is also ginger when it comesto Cliburn being gay. It's mentioned almost as an aside that Cliburn and most of his close friends studying at Juilliard weregay or bi. And his first important relationship is mentioned in passing a decade AFTER it began. Imagine Cliburn having beenmarried and a biographer not bringing it up chronologically until a decade after they tied the knot. It's confusing and
annoying in equal parts. Again and again, major events seem to have happened long ago or long in the future. More
importantly, the fact that most critics consider Cliburn to have had a pretty tragic, uninteresting career is almost tooimpolite for Isakoff to mention. Cliburn quite clearly never came close to fulfilling his early potential, though he remainedworld famous to the end. One doesn't want sensationalizing and perhaps Isakoff simply didn't have access to any diaries or
materials to fully illuminate the artist's life. But for a man who was clearly a maniacal hoarder, enjoyed a weirdly intimate
relationship with his mother, became addicted to speed thanks to a dreadful medical practitioner, collapsed onstage,stopped performing for a decade and made sentimental but never artistic comebacks, his life comes across here as prettyuneventfully. He had a happy ending personally, finding romance in another relationship that lasted until the end of his life.Cliburn even had his partner on his arm for late career honors, which is pretty amazing given the repressive society he
began in. (Both US and Russian officials seemed to worry quite a lot about Cliburn's sexual orientation creating problems for
them in the 1950s and later, amusingly enough.) The material of his life is dramatic and diverse but Isakoff can't quitecapture the sweep or bring alive some very tantalizing details. He has moments of insight (especially about the intersectionof politics and culture) but gets swamped by the passages that demand a more clear-eyed appraisal. Cliburn may have been
a sentimentalist, but his story needs someone less willing to overlook the sadder, more tragic moments where he lost nerve
or squandered opportunity to turn this friendly, useful account into one that reaches for greatness. -- Michael Giltz
