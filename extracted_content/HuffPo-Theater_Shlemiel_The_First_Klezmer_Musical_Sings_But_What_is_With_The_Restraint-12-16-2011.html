 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Shlemiel The First"
Klezmer Musical Sings But What'sWith The Restraint?
SCHLEMIEL THE FIRST  ** 1/2 out of ****
NYU'S JACK H. SKIRBALL CENTER
Writer Isaac Bashevis Singer helped popularize folk tales
about the foolish men of Chelm , a city in Poland. In this
mythical spin on a real place (G-d help them), the wisemen of Chelm mess things up while the women eitherclean up after them or patiently wait for the men to fix
things themselves. Is it really so different from anywhere
else?
Singer turned some of his tales into a stage play and then it became a musical combining folk tunes with
new lyrics just like Singer combined folk stories with his modern wit. Robert Brustein wrote the book,Arnold Weinstein wrote the lyrics and Hankus Netsky composed the music. The result is a lot offoolishness called Shlemiel the First.
Shlemiel bickers with his understanding wife and isn't too upset when the wisest of the wise men of
Chelm suggests he go out to the wide world and tell them exactly how wise the wisest man of Chelm trulyis. So off Shlemiel goes, only he's tricked by a thief into giving up his food and heading back home whenhe thinks he's exploring new worlds. When Shlemiel finds this "new" town that features a woman exactlylike his wife and kids exactly like his children and wise men exactly like the wise of men of Chelm (in fact,they even call this new place Chelm as well!), naturally he and the wise men decide there must be TWOChelms. So poor Shlemiel must try and avoid the temptation to kiss wife #2 while the men figure outwhat went wrong and how to fix it.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>Silly? Of course, happily so, with a lot of rib-tickling word play and groaners thrown in for spice in this
collaboration between Theater For A New Audience  and National Yiddish Theatre.  The production itself
is right in tune with the show. The costumes by Catherine Zuber are amusing (they include some
imposing bosoms for the women built into the padding) and quick to change since a number of the actorsdouble their parts. The set by Robert Israel simply and deftly sets the tone by including a sloping floor tokeep people off balance along with doors and windows all akilter. The bed of Shlemiel and his wifeprovides quite a bit of good comic business since it's standing straight up and people "climb" in and outand toss and turn in amusing ways. The lighting and sound by Jennifer Tipton and David Meschtercontinue to build on the atmosphere, with Meschter doing an especially good job at miking the actorswithout making them sound too miked, so the show has a more natural, old school feel.
Above all there's the Shlemiel Band, led by pianist and conductor Zalmen Mlotek, which does full justice
to the music of the show and even provides an entertaining intermission. They receive the strongest
applause of the night and rightly so.
So what's the problem? If you can believe it, a certain... restraint. It's not often one sees a broad comedy
and walks away thinking, "Gee, I wish they'd played that a little louder, a little bigger." But MichaelIannucci is too bland and unprepossessing to command the stage as Shlemiel and doesn't even try to uphis game. Shlemiel should be the comic engine that drives the whole plot forward but he seems more likea straight man here, and not a very interesting one. It's easy to forget this is his show. Jeff Brooks is alittle better as the smartest fool, Gronam Ox (he's got a little Nathan Lane snap in his voice) but not somuch that you're overwhelmed.
The women fare much better. Amy Warren (so good in Adding Machine  and August: Osage County ) is a
standout as Mrs. Shlemiel, nailing the humor and pathos and genuine affection of her character in every
scene. Kristine Zbornik is right behind her, humorously and patiently changing her costume (usually on
stage) as she flits between the imposing Yenta Pasha and several other characters. Bob Ader is shameless
-- and I thank him -- as Zalman Tippish, a rich man with a horrible cough. His "I'm Going To Die"
number almost outshines the show-stopper "Geography Song."
The voices are strong throughout and the music rousing and silly and that makes up for a lead who
would be better off following. So the women are better than the men. What could be more appropriatefor a show set in Chelm?
