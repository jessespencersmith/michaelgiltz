 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: Law & Order's Record-
Breaking Boxed Set
LAW & ORDER: THE COMPLETE SERIES  ($699.00; Universal) -- As far as I can tell, Law &
Order: The Complete Series  is the biggest boxed set in history with the most hour of programming
devoted to a single series. No wonder: the show ran for 20 seasons. Gunsmoke  could match it, since that
too ran for 20 seasons. 60 Minutes  has been in primetime for more than 40 years; Oprah could match it
with her daytime talk show; The Ed Sullivan Show  ran for decades too; Doctor Who  is going strong and
some children's shows, soap operas and animated series and other programs around the world have gone
on and on. But in the US at least, when it comes to sitcoms and dramas in primetime, L&O  has the
biggest boxed set in history. The Simpsons has more episodes (it's the longest running sitcom andanimated series in history), but since they're half hour shows, Dick Wolf's L&O  still has it beat for a long
time to come in the number of hours it has.

<p>So all in all this is a very impressive boxed set. Much of it is done well. It contains 20 seasons but the set
is slim enough to fit on my shelf alongside other DVDs. Still, if you prefer you can remove the individual
seasons and place them on the shelf instead. Happily, the DVDs are in standard cases, not those horrible
cardboard sleeves that can make them hard to get out and very scratched. They also contain the crossoverepisodes with Homicide. On the downside, Season 14 is presented in a cropped, full screen version used
for syndication; that's not acceptable in a set this lavish and expensive. And where's the Chris Noth TV
movie Exiled  from 1998? Still, you'll spend weeks watching it before you even realize those items are
missing, That's how long it'll take to plow through this comfort food for people who love procedurals.
So here's a question: is Law & Order the greatest franchise in US TV history? Here are some other
contenders:
Star Trek  -- six TV shows (including the animated one), massively popular feature films and (as with all
these franchises) there is more to come. If you ignore the books and merchandise and movies and focus
just on TV, this is a mighty impressive series.
The Simpsons  -- Again, this is a monster when it comes to merchandising; it and Star Trek  probably
far outstrip L&O  once you add in movie and toy sales. But focusing strictly on TV and even including
Futurama, which isn't really a spin-off as such, this will have to settle for legendary classic rather than
the title of biggest franchise of all time...unless that Krusty spin-off gets a move on.
All In The Family -- For pure TV dominance, All In The Family  was a remarkable franchise. Spin-offs
and spin-off of spin-offs that still took place in the Bunker universe include Maude, The Jeffersons, Good
Times, Archie Bunker's Place, Gloria, Checking In,  and 704 Hauser  (even the house  got its own show).
Of course, it's a remake of a British series, so maybe they deserve the credit. Which brings us too....
American Idol  -- A spin-off from the UK series Pop Idol  (which bizarrely floundered, letting Simon
Cowell launch The X Factor  and steal their thunder). Nonetheless, American Idol  was itself a monster
success, passing All In The Family  by being the #1 show in the country for six years in a row (it's gonna
do it again this season too). it has been duplicated all over the world to massive success. Chalk up another
one for the Brits. But hey, this isn't a sitcom or drama. Still, it was worth a mention. Which brings us to
L&O.
Law & Order  -- It has launched four direct spin-offs, including the current hit Law & Order: Special
Victims Unit  (12 seasons and counting), Law & Order: Criminal Intent  (ten seasons) and the less
successful Law & Order: Trial By Jury  and Law & Order: LA.  Homicide: Life On The Streets is another
direct spin-off from the show. It ran for seven seasons, featured major characters from the earlier show
and included crossover episodes making it explicit that these shows took place in the same fictional
world. New York Undercover and In Plain Sight are more of a stretch but can make their arguments.Putting those two aside, that's still a tremendous amount of television springing from this one series. No
wonder they almost launched a cable channel devoted entirely to L&O.
Which leads us to the boxed set of the future: it could contain all five series (once SVU calls it a day). Of
course, it won't be complete because some other L&O series will already be on the air or in the works. So
a number of shows can compete for the title of biggest franchise of all time. But for now, this is the boxed
set to beat.
