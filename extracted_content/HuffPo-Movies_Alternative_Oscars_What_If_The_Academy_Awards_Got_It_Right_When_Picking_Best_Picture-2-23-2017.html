Alternative Oscars! What If The Academy Awards
Got It Right When Picking "Best Picture?"
02/23/2017 02:31 am ET  | Updated  Mar 07, 2017
What if the Academy Awards got it right? I mean, of course they get it wrong. ( Raging Bull  over Ordinary 
People,  Shakespeare in Love over Schindler’s List  and Crash  over Brokeback Mountain,  to name three 
choices that sparked outrage among fans.) That’s not Oscar’s fault: the Grammys, the Emmys and the 
Tonys usually get it wrong too. So yeah, my favorite movie of the year  has almost never been the Best 
Picture winner. I can live with that. 
Yet the really infuriating thing is that the Oscars never even name the best film out of the five or so movies 
they nominate!  I mean, a thousand movies were released in NYC last year so agreeing on the best one 
isn’t easy. But if you make a list of five or eight or ten movies, how hard is it to pick the best one out of them ? Sometimes you like two or three or even four nominees and damned if they don’t choose the 
OTHER movie just to annoy you. Over the years, my sure fire method for picking the winner of the Best Picture award is simply naming the one that would piss me off the most. Frankly, they’ve been getting it wrong since the very first Academy Awards (sort of).
So let’s imagine an Alternative Oscars, a history of the Best Picture winner if the Academy Awards actually
 
got it right. We’ll start with the present and work our way backwards to the very beginning. With the 
Alternative Oscars, you’ll see Astaire & Rogers on top, Orson Welles and Martin Scorsese get their due (when they deserved it) and yes, maybe even gay cowboys win the gold statue because who loves an awards show more than gay cowboys? 
Here’s my showdown of every movie side by side followed by my reasons for voting the way I did. In short,
Alternative Oscars! What If The Academy Awards Got It Right When Picking "Best Picture?</p>
<p>if I was the only voter, the Academy Awards would be amazing! Or at least different. And yes, they’ll get it 
wrong this year too. I’d vote for Manchester By The Sea and be happy with Moonlight  or Hell Or High 
Water  or even Hidden Figures  but the winner will certainly be La La Land.
2015: Spotlight beat 
The Big ShortBridge of SpiesBrooklyn Mad Max: Fury Road The Martian,The RevenantRoomWe say: MAD MAX: FURY ROAD Spotlight  is a classic consensus choice. Everyone had different opinions about the best movie from this 
batch but everyone had Spotlight  as their second or third choice and it became the inoffensive winner. 
Hey, I’m always glad to see journalists as the hero of a movie rather than the enemy of the people. But for 
sheer lunacy, for building on a great action franchise, for out and out “what the heck were they thinking?” envelope-pushing film-making, it’s hard to beat the far more distinctive work of director George Miller in Mad Max: Fury Road.  Oscar loves to taunt us with potential smarts, so Mad Max  swept all the tech awards 
and I foolishly began to dream it would win Best Picture. Ha! Spotlight  is what happens when a big group 
of people have to come to an agreement. But Mad Max: Fury Road  is by far the better film and the latest 
triumph from an exceptionally bold artist.  
2014: Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) beat American SniperBoyhoodThe Grand Budapest HotelThe Imitation GameSelma</p>
<p>The Theory of Everything
WhiplashWe say: THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTELBirdman  is a bore that looked stale the second it was crowned a winner. (Hollywood is too in love with 
movies about artists.) It’s tempting to award the backstory of Boyhood , an admirable film that was made 
over a period of eleven years (without a script!) to capture the joys and perils of growing up without having 
different actors take over roles at different stages. We literally watched a kid grow up.  But my heart belongs with that truffle of a movie, The Grand Budapest Hotel,  a film that harkens back to Hollywood’s 
golden days and the cream puffs of wit and intelligence crafted by Ernst Lubitsch and so many others. I’ve
 
watched it again and again and every element remains a delight, especially the tremendously fun acting in every part, large and small. Besides, it’s our only chance to recognize director Wes Anderson because Oscar was too dumb to nominate Rushmore .   
2013: 12 Years a Slave  beat 
American Hustle
Captain PhillipsDallas Buyers ClubGravityHerNebraskaPhilomenaThe Wolf of Wall StreetWe say: HERAnimal House  is a better film than 12 Years A Slave. Are you offended? Why? I’m not saying that dumb frat 
parties are a worthier topic than the evils of slavery. My point is that you should reward the movie and NOT
what the movie is about. Oscar gets that wrong time and time again. By far the most distinctive movie, the one that speaks to our specific time but is also timeless in its focus on love and intimacy and loneliness and what it means to be human is Her . Two great performances — by Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett 
Johansson — ground this whimsical, bittersweet story about a guy who falls in love with his computer’s</p>
<p>artificial intelligence. If you’ve spent any time trying to stump Siri (”Siri, where’s Waldo?”) then you can 
relate. And it’s our only chance (so far) to reward director Spike Jonze and his body of work.
2012: Argo beat AmourBeasts of the Southern Wild Django UnchainedLes MisérablesLife of PiLincolnSilver Linings PlaybookZero Dark ThirtyWe say: AMOURHollywood again falls hard for a movie about Hollywood with the pleasant Argo . It’s fun; it’s jut not the 
best movie of the year. It’s so rare that Hollywood nominates an international film for Best Picture that you 
can rarely go wrong picking that one as superior. This is certainly the case with the French drama Amour , 
a heartrending tale of two elderly people facing end of life decisions. It’s a career capper for actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva. While you will weep, the movie doesn’t push  you to weep the way 
a Hollywood version might have. 
2011: The Artist beat The DescendantsExtremely Loud & Incredibly Close The HelpHugoMidnight in ParisMoneyball</p>
<p>The Tree of Life
War HorseWe say: THE TREE OF LIFEHey, I’m not perfect either. AGAIN Hollywood falls for a movie about artists and in this case an ode to 
silent cinema. I dug The Artist  at the time — Black and white! Silent movies! France! — and thought it was 
a fun choice. I might have plunked for George Clooney in The Descendants  except the solution to the 
dilemma at the heart of the film seemed obvious from the start. And by the way, a genuine work of art is on this list. Terrence Malick’s The Tree Of Life  at its peak is sheer filmmaking, immersing you in the world 
of a child when running loose in your neighborhood on a summer’s afternoon was an experience bursting with possibility. Sure it’s flawed — you can’t shoot for the moon without stumbling at times. But it’s breathtaking too.
2010: The King’s Speech beat Black SwanThe FighterInceptionThe Kids Are All Right127 HoursThe Social NetworkToy Story 3True GritWinter’s Bone We say: TOY STORY 3If Hollywood isn’t falling for movies about Hollywood, it’s falling for movies with British accents, especially 
when brandished by royalty. Sure, in The King’s Speech  that British accent may include a stutter, but so 
what? It’s a film for moms everywhere. But the real story here is Toy Story 3,  the finale of a trilogy that is 
truly great. Toy Story  was a stunner. Then they ruined it by making a sequel...and it was, if anything, better.
Both deserved to be nominated for Best Picture and one of them should have already won. Then they</p>
<p>spoiled the pleasure of saying Toy Story 2  was one of the great sequels of all time by making another  
sequel.  And by God, Toy Story 3  wrapped up the story of a kid growing up as seen through the eyes of his  
toys in triumphant fashion. And yes, they’re making Toy Story 4.  Why?? I can’t imagine it will be as good 
as the first three, but they’ve proven me wrong before.   
2009: The Hurt Locker beat AvatarThe Blind SideDistrict 9An EducationInglourious BasterdsPreciousA Serious ManUpUp in the Air We say: INGLORIOUS BASTERDSThe Hurt Locker  won Best Picture? That’s the sort of reaction a fine but unremarkable movie like The Hurt 
Locker evokes just a few years after its triumph. I might have given the gold statue to Pixar’s Up , but we’re
 
rewarding them next year. George Clooney’s Up In The Air  is certainly an old school treat. And while we’re 
tempted to keep our powder dry for 1994’s Pulp Fiction,  we’ve got other plans for that year. So this is 
where director Quentin Tarantino has his moment of glory. Inglorious Basterds  is a great war movie and 
the opening sequence alone — set in a farmhouse — will be studied for generations to come by film buffs. 
It made an unlikely star of Christoph Waltz and is merely the latest terrific film to include Brad Pitt, who somehow manages to be in a lot of really good movies without ever getting any credit for good taste or good acting. Besides, the loopy finale rewriting history is so much fun that Tarantino’s over-the-top violence for once feels justified.    
2008: Slumdog Millionaire beat The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonFrost/Nixon</p>
<p>Milk
The Reader We say: NO AWARD!Sometimes, Hollywood gives you no reason to watch the Oscars at all. This was one of those years. They 
could have nominated WALL-E, Let The Right One In,  the delightful French film The Class,  Emma 
Thompson and Dustin Hoffman in Last Chance Harvey  (check it out!), Kung-Fu Panda , the masterpiece 
The Edge Of Heaven  by the German director Fatih Akin or the terrific debut Shotgun Stories  by Jeff 
Nichols (who saw a nomination this year for his movie Loving) . Yeah, most of those weren’t going to 
happen and it wasn’t a vintage year for movies. But did Oscar have to rub that in our face?   
2007: No Country for Old Men beat AtonementJunoMichael ClaytonThere Will Be Blood We say: THERE WILL BE BLOODI want to reward the sheer pleasure of Michael Clayton.  But director Paul Thomas Anderson is a master 
(and his film The Master  won’t even be nominated in 2012) so the epic drama There Will Be Blood  will 
triumph. Who can deny Daniel Day Lewis, though damned if Paul Dano isn’t his match every step of the 
way.   
2006: The Departed beat BabelLetters from Iwo JimaLittle Miss SunshineThe Queen We say: NO AWARD!</p>
<p>Hey, I don’t like wimping out any more than you do, but director Martin Scorsese will triumph long before 
the so-so film The Departed  proved a pretty good remake of a superior Hong Kong film. And absolutely 
none of the others deserve the top prize. What did Hollywood ignore? The brilliant Pan’s Labyrinth  (which 
didn’t even win Best Foreign Film!) and United 93  and Almodovar’s Volver  and Ryan Gosling in Half Nelson  
and the cult classic indie noir Brick , among others. Sorry, everyone go home. No winner.   
2005: Crash beat 
Brokeback MountainCapoteGood Night, and Good LuckMunich We say: BROKEBACK MOUNTAINFrankly, we’re shocked Hollywood hasn’t already  honored George Clooney. How glamorous and cool does
a movie star have to be to get some respect around here? Clooney deserved it for Good Night, And Good 
Luck,  a pitch perfect drama about journalist Edward R. Murrow standing up to the fear and loathing of the 
McCarthy era witch hunts. The cast is flawless, led by a career peak from David Strathairn as Murrow. AndClooney’s direction is impeccable from start to finish. Indeed, we picked his film and wrote an entire entry. But it just felt wrong. Crash  absolutely shouldn’t have won Best Picture and Brokeback Mountain  
absolutely should. True, in our Alternative Oscars universe, Ang Lee will have already won the big prize. (For Sense & Sensibility? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?  Keep reading!) Still, the “gay cowboys” movie 
has the zeitgeist behind it, along with two great performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger and it can’t be denied.
2004: Million Dollar Baby beat The Aviator Finding NeverlandRaySidewaysWe say: NO AWARD!
The best option here is Million Dollar Baby, but Clint Eastwood just triumphed with a much more fitting win</p>
<p>and two Best Pictures this close together feels a little much. It’s a good movie (though I haven’t watched it  
since it came out), but not that good. The rest aren’t even close. And when we complain that Oscar 
doesn’t even nominate the best movies of the year, 2004 is a great example. They ignored The Incredibles,  
Spider-Man 2, Vera Drake, Friday Night Lights, The Motorcycle Diaries, The Bourne Supremacy, House Of Flying Daggers  and even Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle!  Are you telling us Hollywood has never 
smoked and then had the munchies? But the game we’re playing is not the easy one of naming our favorite film of the year (It was The Incredibles ) but choosing the best of the nominees. And Million Dollar 
Baby  it is.
2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King beat 
Lost in TranslationMaster and Commander: The Far Side Of The WorldMystic RiverSeabiscuit We say: MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLDDon’t worry, LOTR  fans, that movie already has plenty of glory. And let’s face it, the tickle-fest finale was 
not the strongest installment. So I’m choosing Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World,  a 
marvelous seafaring drama by director Peter Weir that stars Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. This is 
Hollywood old school filmmaking at its best, taking a brilliant series of novels by Patrick O’Brian and launching what should have been the first of a franchise. If it had won Best Picture, maybe this would have
 
made more money or at least someone would have been shamed into bankrolling another entry. (It cost $150 million and made only $212 million worldwide.) I mean, Ioan Gruffudd can’t seem to make another Hornblower miniseries for love or money. But surely Russell Crowe should be able to make this happen.  
2002: Chicago beat Gangs of New YorkThe HoursThe Lord of the Rings: The Two TowersThe Pianist We say: THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS</p>
<p>The middle and best entry in The Lord Of The Rings  is definitely the one to celebrate one of the most 
daring and successful film projects in history. Yes, making all three LOTR  movies at once was a bold roll of  
the dice and Peter Jackson was hardly a slam dunk. (And seems to be struggling to prove this wasn’t the 
one project he was born to make after the fiasco of the Hobbit  trilogy.) Chicago?  Musicals are great but 
not when they’re edited to razzle dazzle you to death.   
2001: A Beautiful Mind beat Gosford ParkIn the BedroomMoulin RougeThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingWe say: GOSFORD PARKJust like Oscar, we are tempted to honor careers rather than the film in front of us. Though if this were 
2001 and we were voting, we’d probably have cast our ballot for LOTR  since it was such a game-changer 
and we never imagined those novels would be turned into a satisfying live action movie. But since it’s going to win the gold statue next year, we can give the great director Robert Altman a final bow with Gosford Park . It’s easily the best work screenwriter Julian Fellowes will ever do, far outpacing his soapy 
writing for Downton Abbey ( which isn’t a patch on Upstairs, Downstairs).  In this case, the melding of that 
classic series and its dynamic of toggling back and forth between the servants and the masters is combined with both a murder mystery and Altman’s way with a large cast and overlapping dialogue to brilliant effect.    
2000: Gladiator beat ChocolatCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Erin BrockovichTrafficWe say: CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGONNever have I been more infuriated by the Oscars than the year they ignored the masterpiece Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  It was the highest grossing foreign language film in North American history. It was a</p>
<p>triumph of popular filmmaking for director Ang Lee, who was on an incredible artistic role. It elevated a 
genre of fantasy/martial arts movies with acting of the highest order. (An action film hadn’t been this well acted since Harrison Ford first donned the fedora in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. ) And it was high time the 
Best Picture Oscar went to a movie that wasn’t in the English language. Besides, it’s so much fun! Yeah, the dudes out there can quote lines from Gladiator  and think it’s awesome. But it’s not.
1999: American Beauty beat 
The Cider House RulesThe Green MileThe InsiderThe Sixth Sense We say: THE INSIDERAmerican Beauty  is another Oscar winner that felt like a mistake about two minutes after it won. Indeed, its
stock has fallen among critics ever since. I rather admire the old-fashioned charm of The Cider House 
Rules  but that would seem a safe, soft choice. Let’s go with director Michael Mann and his scathing 
expose The Insider.  This story of a whistle blower in the tobacco industry is a master class in polemics, 
exposing corruption and detailing how the sausages are made when it comes to lobbying and corporate greed. Russell Crowe should be in multiple Oscar winners — just not Gladiator .   
1998: Shakespeare in Love beat 
ElizabethLife is BeautifulSaving Private RyanThe Thin Red Line We say: THE THIN RED LINEWhat an upset! Shakespeare in Love  beat out Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan  and our most popular 
director was denied his rightful award! Actually, no. The real shocker was that one of Hollywood’s greatest
 
directors made a completely unexpected comeback and triumphed to a phenomenal degree with his tone 
poem of a war movie The Thin Red Line.  Director Terrence Malick is a legend and his first movie in 20 
years couldn’t possibly live up to the hype. But it did. True, he’s gone a little batty lately, turning out</p>
<p>movies with increasing speed and a complete disregard for whether or not he has something worth 
saying. But there’s no denying this movie’s power, which already seems better than it did even back in 1998.   
1997: Titanic beat As Good as It GetsGood Will HuntingL.A. ConfidentialThe Full Monty We say: L.A. CONFIDENTIALGive director James Cameron the Best Director award if you must. Titanic  is a fine spectacle and it’s fun to
 
watch the ship sink and yes Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have charm to spare. And that’s it. A 
good movie this is not. (Cameron’s Aliens  or T2  is better.) But by far the best film is L.A. Confidential,  a 
now classic noir-ish story of corruption in the City Of Angels. Yet ANOTHER Russell Crowe movie that deserves to win Best Picture. (Just not Gladiator .) It’s also a good lesson in never writing someone off. I 
would not have imagined director Curtis Hanson had a great film in him, not after The Bedroom Window  or 
The River Wild or The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.  I did think the little seen Bad Influence  (starring James
 
Spader and Rob Lowe) was pretty fun. But a great film? I wasn’t holding my breath. Yet, the right director with the right material and the right cast can click in ways you’d never suspect. That was certainly the casehere and Hanson proved he could do it again with Wonder Boys.  I’ve always avoided insult criticism or 
baldly stating that someone had no talent; that’s just not my style. And as Hanson proves, you never know....   
1996: The English Patient beat Fargo Jerry MaguireSecrets & LiesShine We say: FARGOActually, I typed in Jerry Maguire  first and then erased it for Fargo . Tom Cruise is a great star and that</p>
<p>romantic drama is a treat. You have to like a movie that salutes Billy Wilder. And I’d much rather salute 
three or four other Coen Brother movies. But since I’ve taken away their win for No Country For Old Men,  I 
want to give them the spotlight here. Besides, the movie Fargo  is a comic delight with a deadpan Frances 
McDormand rightly winning Best Actress. I’ve really gone back and forth between these two movies but Fargo  gets bonus points for the unlikely accomplishment of spinning off a great TV series. The English 
Patient  isn’t a patch on the novel and only feels  like a major film. Great score, though.   
1995: Braveheart beat 
Apollo 13BabeThe PostmanSense and Sensibility We say: BABEThis is tough. The Postman  is dreck and I really didn’t like Braveheart  at all, which does show Mel Gibson 
improving as a director but that’s a low bar given his debut The Man Without A Face.  (That film perversely 
turned a young adult novel about a kid learning to accept his sexual orientation — thanks to an inspiring 
adult gay man in his life —  into a movie about an adult man who reacts angrily with disdain when it’s suggested he might be gay. Nice.) I actually quite like Apollo 13,  which is by far Ron Howard’s best movie 
and the perfect time for Hollywood to salute one of their own. I adore Emma Thompson and believe Sense And Sensibility  is a masterpiece. But I also think Babe  is a masterpiece and it’s a more distinctive  
masterpiece, as well as an envelope-pusher in terms of what can be done on screen. Hollywood so rarely honors family films like this one that I feel Babe  deserves it, but it pulls ahead of Sense And Sensibility  only
 
by a snout. And the dudes who couldn’t believe I rejected Gladiator  have now officially stopped reading.)
1994: Forrest Gump beat 
Four Weddings and a FuneralPulp FictionQuiz ShowThe Shawshank Redemption We say QUIZ SHOW</p>
<p>I appreciate the stunt that is Forrest Gump  and Tom Hanks in it. And I won’t argue with the many, many 
people who feel The Shawshank Redemption  is not merely the best film of 1994 but one of the best films 
of all time. They’re wrong, but I won’t argue with them. (However, I do believe the short story collection 
Different Seasons  by Stephen King that includes it is  his best collection. It also led to the movies Apt Pupil  
and Stand By Me,  which is pretty great.) Four Weddings And A Funeral  has charm to spare and Pulp 
Fiction  is a landmark movie. A flawed landmark but a landmark. (I’d honor Reservoir Dogs  and Inglorious 
Basterds  and Django Unchained  ahead of it.) Most people would probably pick Pulp Fiction  as the most 
important film here. But in Alternative Oscars, Robert Redford did NOT triumph with Ordinary People.  So 
this is his moment and a very worthy one. Quiz Show  has fallen off the radar a bit. It’s the story of the quiz 
show scandal that rocked the TV industry in its infancy. And really it’s about America and the price of fame  
and valuing celebrity over integrity and flash over genuine worth. It’s a great, great film that ‘s beautifully made and — unlike Pulp Fiction  — flawless.   
1993: Schindler's List beat 
In the Name of the FatherThe FugitiveThe PianoThe Remains of the Day We say: THE PIANOSteven Spielberg finally won the big one with his Holocaust movie. But he’s already won in our Alternative 
Oscars. It’s an Important Film but the better  film is director Jane Campion’s masterpiece The Piano.  It’s 
long, long past due for a woman to win Best Picture and Campion’s remarkable film is the one to do it.   
1992: Unforgiven beat The Crying Game A Few Good MenHowards EndScent of a WomanWe say: UNFORGIVENI really wanted to honor Howards End,  arguably the peak of the Merchant-Ivory body of old-fashioned and</p>
<p>satisfying cinema. But Clint Eastwood’s triumph with a Western is too good to pass up. Besides, it’s a 
much better winner than Million Dollar Baby, so if Clint is going to win it better be right here. 
1991: The Silence of the Lambs beat Beauty and the BeastBugsyJFKThe Prince of Tides We say: BEAUTY AND THE BEASTThis is actually a pretty good batch. And it’s cool that The Silence Of The Lambs  became the first 
nominally horror film (or perhaps thriller) to win Best Picture. JFK  or Bugsy  would have been fine too 
though both have flaws. Only The Prince Of Tides  would have proven a bad choice. But come on, the first 
animated film to be nominated for Best Picture also fully deserved to become the first animated film to 
WIN Best Picture. It’s also the best movie musical in a generation and remains a treat.    
1990: Dances With Wolves beat Awakenings,GhostGoodfellasThe Godfather, Part III We say: GOODFELLASThis is one of those years in which the winner is roundly mocked as absurd. Actually, it’s not. Dances With
 
Wolves  has sweep and power and is a good film. And it’s FAR preferable to three other options. Thank 
God Kevin Costner won instead of Awakening  or Ghost  or — heaven forfend — The Godfather Part III.  
Still, there’s no doubt that Martin Scorsese should have won (again) for his tremendously entertaining 
gangster flick GoodFellas . Scorsese pulled out all the stops on this one and it’s a masterpiece.
1989: Driving Miss Daisy beat 
Born on the Fourth of July</p>
<p>Dead Poets Society
Field of DreamsMy Left FootWe say: FIELD OF DREAMSIt’s easy to think of a Best Picture type movie as serious and important. By those standards, the corrosive 
and angry and often brilliant Born On The Fourth Of July  deserves to triumph. My Left Foot is pure Oscar 
bait as well, an inspiring bio-pic with Daniel Day Lewis winning Best Actor for his brilliant but unsentimental turn as Christy Brown. Both are good. But I’ve actually watched Field Of Dreams  a dozen 
times over the years and seen clips from it again and again and yes it’s middle brow and sentimental and heart-tugging and has one lame scene at the school board meeting. So sue me! Sometimes I want to tear up at the thought of playing catch with the old man. James Earl Jones’ speech about baseball sends chills up my spine every single time and the movie is bursting with great actors in great roles, including a swan song from Burt Lancaster and a young Ray Liotta wild-eyed with dangerous charm that would catch fire in GoodFellas . It’s goofy and heartfelt and maybe the dudes furious at me for taking away the Oscar from 
Gladiator  and Braveheart  will take comfort in the fact that I got it right this time. Oh and Driving Miss 
Daisy?  Pious claptrap delivered by two good actors.    
1988: Rain Man beat 
Dangerous LiaisonsMississippi BurningThe Accidental TouristWorking Girl We say: DANGEROUS LIAISONSThis is an easy pick since Dangerous Liaisons  is the only movie worthy of snagging the Best Picture. 
Happily, it’s very  worthy, delivering the play (based on the novel) with malicious glee. Keanu Reeves is 
used well, with his dumb lug persona making him easy prey. Glenn Close is brilliant and matched every 
step of the way by John Malcovich in two legendary performances that savor every poisonous line of dialogue. Oh and Rain Man?  Pious claptrap delivered by two good actors.   
1987: The Last Emperor  beat 
Broadcast News</p>
<p>Fatal Attraction
Hope and GloryMoonstruck We say: BROADCAST NEWSAnother very good year for Oscar, with only Fatal Attraction  as a nominee that would have proved 
embarrassing to win. The Last Emperor  is very good indeed and in fact all four of the nominees made my 
list for the best films of 1987.  (Which incidentally, I consider to be in the running for “best year of all time” 
for movies, alongside 1939 and a few others.) It kind of pains me NOT to pick Hope & Glory,  the delightful 
British film by John Boorman. But I’m going to go for the Hollywood crowd pleaser Broadcast News , a 
triumph for James L. Brooks (who also did great work in TV) and a signal achievement for Holly Hunter, 
William Hurt and Albert Brooks. Plus, it has so much to say about the dumbing down of the news that the film remains as timeless as ever.    
1986: Platoon beat Children of a Lesser GodHannah and Her SistersThe Mission A Room with a ViewWe say: HANNAH AND HER SISTERS and A ROOM WITH A VIEW (a tie!)
Why not a tie? The Oscars famously once had a tie for Best Actress with Barbra Streisand and Katharine 
Hepburn. Hepburn didn’t show up (she never did when competing) but Streisand probably would have won Best Acceptance Speech by hungrily eyeing that gold statue and saying, “Hello, gorgeous!” On my list for the best films of each year, 1986 is one of only three years in which I announced a tie:  Hannah and 
Her Sisters  and A Room With A View.  (The other ties on my list are 1944, in which I honored TWO Preston 
Sturges films ( Miracle At Morgan’s Creek  and Hail The Conquering Hero ) and 1940 (whenI couldn’t make 
the Sophie’s Choice-like decision between my two favorite romantic comedies of all time, The Philadelphia Story  and The Shop Around The Corner ). Merchant-Ivory had been quietly making tasteful 
literary adaptations for years. But A Room With A View has a buoyancy, a charm and lightness about it thatis nigh on irresistible. (The score and music cues help tremendously.) And it has brilliant casting for the ages, courtesy of Celestia Fox. Very early or key roles for a clutch of terrific actors including Rupert Graves, Julian Sands, Simon Callow, Daniel Day Lewis (who literally shot to fame when both this movie andMy Beautiful Laundrette  opened on the same day in New York City) and of course Helena Bonham Carter</p>
<p>and her gorgeous hair. (But seriously, what a tremendous lead performance, often overlooked because it’s 
a romance and a comedy and she’s a woman, so of course how could critics take it seriously?) But let’s also honor Woody Allen and his warm masterpiece Hannah And Her Sisters.  It came right at the peak of 
his powers, that great run of movies from Annie Hall  to Husbands And Wives.  (Though frankly, I don’t want 
to downplay the fun of his earlier comedies either.) I value The Purple Rose Of Cairo  even more as a 
perfectly crafted jewel. Shockingly, Hollywood didn’t nominate that one, even though it’s a celebration of movies. Go figure. But Hannah And Her Sisters  is a supreme achievement and embodies everything Allen 
was about — it’s erudite, urban, Jewish, funny and serious. It’s all here, plus a clip of the Marx Brothers. Who could ask for anything more?
1985: Out of Africa beat The Color PurpleKiss of the Spider WomanPrizzi’s HonorWitness We say: WITNESSI sure wish I could keep my powder dry for director John Huston and honor his final film, The Dead.  
Needless to say, it wasn’t nominated for Best Picture. And I’m ashamed to say that when I was young and 
foolish I included both The Color Purple  and Out Of Africa  on my best of the year list, even though both 
are very flawed movies and haven’t held up over the years. Kiss Of The Spider Woman  is a little too self-
important so that leaves Huston’s black comedy Prizzi’s Honor  and Peter Weir’s Witness . I couldn’t decide
and put it up for a vote among two friend: one chose Prizzi’s Honor and the other chose Witness ! So that 
helped. I’m going to lean towards the movie I’ve watched more often since it came out and that means the old-fashioned treat that is Witness .
1984: Amadeus beat 
The Killing Fields A Passage to IndiaPlaces in the HeartA Soldier’s StoryWe say: AMADEUS</p>
<p>They got it right this time. It happens.
1983: Terms of Endearment beat The Big ChillThe DresserThe Right Stuff Tender MerciesWe say: THE RIGHT STUFFYou really couldn’t go wrong this year, thanks to five solid nominees. I suppose most critics look down on 
The Big Chill  and maybe it doesn’t hold up quite as well as I’d hope, but I do love it. I haven’t seen Terms 
Of Endearment  in many, many years but I’m going to let James L. Brooks win with the superior Broadcast 
News  so that’s out. The Dresser  is a lovely two-hander and Tender Mercies  is really a great film. But I have
 
to give it up for the ambition and sweep and tremendous cast and brilliant editing (!) and indeed every single element of Philip Kaufman’s The Right Stuff.  A great work of (new) journalism turned into a great 
film. Too bad it didn’t propel John Glenn into the White House the way some imagined, but that wasn’t about to happen, was it?   
1982: Gandhi beat E.T.: The Extra-TerrestrialMissingTootsie The VerdictWe say: TOOTSIEReally, anything but Gandhi . That turgid, tiresome movie has a great performance by Ben Kingsley and 
absolutely nothing else to recommend it, thanks to the poor direction of Richard Attenborough, who made 
a fine Santa Claus but is not a natural filmmaker by any means. If Steven Spielberg hadn’t won it all just theprevious year, this should have been his moment. But he just  got the Oscar so that leaves the door open 
for the two Sidneys/Sydneys. Sidney Lumet’s The Verdict  is a solid bit of workmanship and frankly I’d vote
 
for Paul Newman over Kingsley. But Sydney Pollack’s Tootsie  is one of the greatest comedies of all time 
and I’d vote for Dustin Hoffman over all of them. It’s brilliantly constructed and reaches a climax so</p>
<p>breathlessly funny I had to see it twice in the theater just so I could hear the dialogue over the audience’s 
laughter. And it’s grounded in character from start to finish. Hollywood always treats comedy like a secondclass citizen and it shouldn’t.
1981: Chariots of Fire beat Atlantic CityOn Golden PondRaiders of the Lost ArkReds We say: RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARKAnother strong batch from Hollywood. I really like Chariots of Fire  and cheered when the little movie that 
could won it all. On Golden Pond  has two performances for the ages but the script is awfully weak. 
Atlantic City  is pretty great and Reds  is the best pro-communist movie Hollywood ever made. But for 
sheer entertainment, for both celebrating the glory days of the movie serials and raising them to high art 
thanks to state of the art technical elements and Harrison Ford bringing new depth and humor to action films, you can’t deny Raiders Of The Lost Ark.  It’s nigh on perfect.   
1980: Ordinary People beat 
Coal Miner’s DaughterRaging BullTessThe Elephant Man We say: RAGING BULLOh the injustice! 1980 is Ground Zero for anyone who wants to complain that Oscar is stupid and gets it 
wrong, wrong, wrong. If you start to type a sentence that claims the Academy Awards honors the wrong movie, I swear to you auto-correct will immediately fill in “and Exhibit Number One is the year Ordinary People  beat out Raging Bull. ” Well, they’re wrong. The real injustice is when a bad  movie beats out a good
 
movie, not when a very good movie beats out another very good movie or even when a very good movie beats out a stone cold masterpiece. Every single film nominated in 1980 is a very good film and has stood the test of time, Ordinary People  very much  included. Nonetheless, Raging Bull  isn’t just the best film of</p>
<p>1980, it’s one of the best films of all time and indeed a stone cold masterpiece. Martin Scorsese, here’s 
your first Oscar.   
1979: Kramer vs. Kramer beat All That JazzApocalypse NowBreaking AwayNorma Rae We say: APOCALYPSE NOWNo obvious groaners but I prefer to make Dustin Hoffman wait for Tootsie  before being in another Best 
Picture winner. My heart belongs to Breaking Away  but there’s no denying Francis Ford Coppola’s 
Apocalypse Now  looms large in cinematic history. It’s definitely the most important and influential film of 
the year. Besides, winning here will make up for the storm of outrage when The Godfather Part II  lost out a 
few years earlier, even though we all know it’s the greatest sequel of all time.   1978: The Deer Hunter beat An Unmarried WomanComing HomeHeaven Can WaitMidnight Express We say: COMING HOMENo, Oscar didn’t get it right. All five of these movies are flawed and unsatisfying in some way, though all 
have worthy elements too. And look at the movies they ignored! Where’s Superman: The Movie  or 
Terrence Malick’s Days Of Heaven  or Scorsese’s brilliant concert film The Last Waltz  or Grease  or National
 
Lampoon’s Animal House  or the horror flicks Dawn Of The Dead  and Halloween  or foreign hits like 
Autumn Sonata  or — why not — Jackie Chan’s Drunken Master ? Instead we’ve got self-importance 
everywhere you turn. But I’m swayed towards Coming Home  for one simple, completely extraneous 
reason: John Wayne handed out the Best Picture Oscar. While I’m sure Wayne was wary of The Deer Hunter,  I’ll bet it would have bothered him even more to see Jane Fonda bounding up onstage in glory. 
Plus, maybe director Michael Cimino wouldn’t have self-imploded in glory and made more good movies</p>
<p>beyond Heaven’s Gate.  
1977: Annie Hall beat 
The Goodbye Girl,JuliaStar WarsThe Turning Point We say: STAR WARSSorry, Woody. It was a deserving win but you’ll get one soon enough. And movies don’t come more game-
changing than Star Wars.  It doubled down on the success of Jaws  to turn summer into a hot season for 
movies. It pushed technology to its limits. It foresaw the era we live in dominated by franchises and B movies being made on A movie budgets (as John Waters once pointed out). And it’s a great film filled with stars in the making. The fact that all three leads went on to substantial careers in Hollywood is no fluke. It would have been wrong to see Hollywood being out of touch because it gave its top prize to a big hit comedy by one of the most famous directors in the world. But Star Wars  is the smarter choice when 
you’ve got one eye on history.   
1976: Rocky beat All the President’s MenBound for GloryNetworkTaxi Driver We say: ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MENAnother solid year with no bad choices. And who doesn’t love the underdog story of Rocky ? I’d argue that 
the 1970s practically belonged to director Hal Ashby, who made Bound For Glory  (a fact first made clear 
to me by critic Peter Biskind). Network  and Taxi Driver  are important and yet stumble a little in their desire 
to BE important. The simple fact is that All The President’s Men  is a tremendous film that turned a very 
unlikely subject (guys typing furiously and talking on the phone) into a gripping story. And its mantra is just 
as important today as it was back in the Watergate era: follow the rubles.   
1975: One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest beat</p>
<p>Barry Lyndon
Dog Day AfternoonJawsNashville We say: DOG DAY AFTERNOONNothing wrong with One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest,  especially since it improved on a novel that’s a 
dated relic of the period. Spielberg will win it all with Raiders Of The Lost Ark  so we can pass over Jaws  
(and bemoan the fact that some of his best films weren’t even nominated, such as Close Encounters Of 
The Third Kind  and Empire Of The Sun — actually, full credit to Oscar for just nominating Jaws ). And boy 
do I love Nashville . But I also love the reckless, anything goes pure Seventies vibe of Dog Day Afternoon. 
Al Pacino is so mesmerizing and compelling you’d swear he was reinventing film acting right in front of you. Plus, it’s a bank heist movie with gender reassignment surgery as the driving plot point! Attica! Attica!
    
1974: The Godfather, Part II beat 
ChinatownThe ConversationLennyThe Towering Inferno We say: CHINATOWNIt’s an outrage! How could our Alternative Oscars have the time to make sober judgements and then 
overrule Oscar when it actually got it right? Yes, The Godfather, Part II  is one of the greatest sequels of all 
time. It actually makes the already great The Godfather  better in retrospect. (Though not in the awful TV 
miniseries version Coppola dished out that ruined the brilliant structure of Part II. ) But in this universe the 
Coppola vote is split by Part II  and his other  brilliant movie that year, The Conversation.  And that’s how we
 
end up with Roman Polanski’s terrific noir Chinatown . Hey, just be glad it wasn’t The Towering Inferno.  
1973: The Sting beat 
American GraffitiCries and Whispers</p>
<p>The Exorcist
A Touch of ClassWe say: CRIES AND WHISPERSHey, it’s the Alternative Oscars so whenever we can, we’ll choose something else. It’s not fun overturning 
a grand entertainment like The Sting,  but we’ve gone heavy on crowd pleasers like Star Wars  and Raiders 
Of The Lost Ark  and Tootsie  and Field Of Dreams;  so snobs we’re not. We’d love to honor a horror movie 
but have an animus against The Exorcist  for some reason. (William Friedkin is his own worst enemy.) Cries
 
and Whispers  is not the Ingmar Bergman film we want to immortalize but it’s the only one we’ve got (he did
win three Foreign Film Oscars) so there you are.    
1972: The Godfather beat CabaretDeliveranceSounderThe Emigrants We say: THE GODFATHERThey got it right. We could blow your mind by arguing for Cabaret  or even The Emigrants  but we’re not 
crazy. The Godfather  really is a masterpiece, even though the idea of honor among thieves is a poisonous 
one that watching the movie carefully should disabuse you of...and yet somehow doesn’t.   1971: The French Connection beat A Clockwork OrangeFiddler on the RoofNicholas and AlexandraThe Last Picture Show We say: THE LAST PICTURE SHOWThree of the five movies are very worthy so that’s a relief. Stanley Kubrick has already been honored by</p>
<p>Oscar (you’ll get there soon enough) so that doesn’t make A Clockwork Orange  a must-pick. (Sadly, his 
greatest film — 2001: A Space Odyssey  — was typically ignored by the Academy Awards.) So I’ll happily 
honor one of my favorite films of all time, The Last Picture Show.  Another sterling cast that enjoyed 
tremendous success is on display here. And while it’s not the debut film of director Peter Bogdanovich, it 
feels  like his debut film and boy did he make three great movies in a row with this, Paper Moon  and What’s  
Up, Doc?  (Thanks, Polly Platt! ) Author Larry McMurtry has surely been blessed by the gods when it comes  
to Hollywood adapting his novels. Here’s proof positive.   
1970: Patton beat AirportFive Easy PiecesLove StoryMASH We say: MASHA very flawed list with no good pick.  Patton  is the sort of ponderous bio-pic Hollywood was running away 
from, which makes it a particularly bad choice for kicking off the 1970s. Airport  and Love Story  aren’t 
worth mentioning and Five Easy Pieces  has that great scene in the diner and a lot to recommend it and a 
lot of flaws, too. That leaves Robert Alman’s MASH , which is a little more poisonous than you remember 
because you’re confusing it with the TV series. That was styled M*A*S*H,  by the way, and for three years 
the show dramatically improved on the film and then it spent another eight years slowly going warm and 
fuzzy. But the movie does capture Altman in fine scattershot, rule-breaking form and it typifies the era in some unclassifiable way. I prefer McCabe And Mrs. Miller  and Nashville , but this and Gosford Park  is 
plenty for honoring Altman.   
1969: Midnight Cowboy beat Anne of the Thousand DaysButch Cassidy and the Sundance KidHello Dolly!Z We say: BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID</p>
<p>I’m not going to wait until 1969 to start recognizing the young turks taking over Hollywood. So I don’t need 
to give acclaim to the always rather sordid Midnight Cowboy,  which was bold for being X-rated (since 
changed to an R) and tackling prostitution and gays and the lowlife people on the streets of New York City.  
I just wish I didn’t feel like the movie  sort of disapproved of all those low-life people and the sad pathetic 
gay characters right along with society. (Maybe that’s why Hollywood embraced it; you think they’re super liberal but Hollywood is actually very conventional and stolid.) So instead I’m picking another crowd-pleaser, the terrific Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid.  It’s a great showcase for Robert Redford and 
Paul Newman, two terrific actors with so much chemistry you’d swear their next movie was going to be Brokeback Mountain.  Plus, it’s a lot quirkier than you remember, George Roy Hill is a fun maverick and it’ll 
give screenwriter William Goldman even more bragging rights.   At the time, Hollywood would have been seen as too timid to embrace Midnight Cowboy  but history would have proven them right.
1968: Oliver! beat 
Funny GirlRachel RachelRomeo and JulietThe Lion in Winter We say: ROMEO & JULIETForget Baz Luhrmann. If you want to see a Romeo & Juliet  positively burning with pent-up desire, this is 
the one. The two young leads are simply beautiful and they really, really want to have sex with each other 
— it makes the entire point of this doomed romance crystal clear. The lines are delivered crisply and with clarity, the production is sumptuous and the supporting cast excellent. You don’t need gimmicks to get across Shakespeare and this proves it. The rest are fine if flawed movies in one way or another. Ignored in 1968: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Once Upon A Time In The West, The Producers, Planet Of The Apes, 
Rosemary’s Baby  and Night Of The Living Dead.  
1967: In the Heat of the Night beat 
Bonnie and ClydeDoctor DolittleGuess Who’s Coming to DinnerThe Graduate</p>
<p>We say: BONNIE AND CLYDE
It might have been The Graduate,  but since director Mike Nichols just won it big the year before, that 
would be overkill. Is there any question that it and Bonnie and Clyde  are landmark films and hugely 
influential? Of course not. They dwarf the stillborn Doctor Dolittle  and the good intentions of In The Heat 
Of The Night  and Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner.  (I do still enjoy Spencer Tracy’s final speech but the film  
is otherwise a bore.) Besides, Pauline Kale was wrong and then she was right when finally appreciating 
this film on a second viewing. It’s only improved with age.   
1966: A Man for All Seasons beat AlfieThe Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are ComingThe Sand PebblesWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? We say: WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?This is an easy one with director Mike Nichols moving from sketch comedy to acclaimed stage director to 
terrific filmmaker without skipping a beat. It’s an extraordinary play turned into an extraordinary film with lead performances by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor that remain the standard by which every stage actor has been judged ever since. The rest on this list simply pale in comparison.   
1965: The Sound of Music beat A Thousand ClownsDarlingDoctor ZhivagoShip of Fools    We say: THE SOUND OF MUSICThey got it right and phooey to anyone who thinks this is sentimental claptrap. It’s sentimental claptrap 
that’s impeccably made and beautifully acted, thank you  very much. Plus, it’s a musical, folks and this is a
 
musical bursting with great numbers. It notably improves on the stage version, cutting out a number that doesn’t work and adding in another (”I Have Confidence”) that works brilliantly. And it’s Julie Andrews, one
 
of the great stage actors instantly cementing her place after Mary Poppins  as one of the most loved film</p>
<p>actors of all time. (To think Oscar didn’t even nominate Victor/Victoria! )
1964: My Fair Lady beat 
BecketDr. StrangeloveMary Poppins Zorba The GreekWe say: DR. STRANGELOVEMy Fair Lady  is one of the greatest musicals of all time, maybe THE greatest musical of all time. And 
Audrey Hepburn is a charming presence on screen. But the film version is fatally flawed for NOT casting 
Julie Andrews. Plus the once great director George Cukor turned a witty delight into a wax museum of a film that seems to take forever . Andrews got sweet revenge by winning the Best Actress Oscar for her turn
 
in the much better movie musical Mary Poppins.  But we’ve got to give the Oscar for Best Picture to Dr. 
Strangelove.  Stanley Kubrick’s blackly hilarious comedy about nuclear war is anarchy on screen of the 
likes not seen since the Marx Brothers broke up. My dad laughed so hard when he saw it in Bermuda for the first time that other theater goers commented on how much he liked it. (They were otherwise thrown for a loop by the film, I gather.) Hollywood wouldn’t really let the kids take over for a few years but this is the first crack in its stodgy old ways of doing things.
1963: Tom Jones beat America AmericaCleopatraHow the West Was WonLilies of the Field We say: AMERICA AMERICATom Jones  is a nice nod to the Brits and the only other worthy film on the list. But this is the Alternative 
Oscars so let’s tip our hat to director Elia Kazan’s all but forgotten ode to immigrants. Maybe if it had won 
Best Picture more people would see it and be reminded that the immigrant story IS the story of America.   
1962: Lawrence of Arabia beat</p>
<p>To Kill a Mockingbird 
The Longest DayThe Music ManMutiny on the BountyWe say: LAWRENCE OF ARABIAThey got it right. 1961: West Side Story beat FannyJudgment at NurembergThe Guns of NavaroneThe Hustler We say: THE HUSTLERI actually like West Side Story  though many of my cineaste friends have issues with it. It’s a lot odder than 
one would think and that’s part of its strength. Again, we’ve got a lead in a musical who can’t sing and 
that’s never a good thing, Marni Nixon or no Marni Nixon. I do enjoy The Guns Of Navarone  but there’s 
nothing special about it. So the Oscar goes to The Hustler,  a great film about pool sharks that features a 
magnetic Paul Newman, a terrific George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason having a blast as Minnesota Fats. He had a remarkable career but it’s a pity he didn’t do more work like this in the movies.     
1960: The Apartment beat The AlamoElmer GantrySons and LoversThe Sundowners We say: THE APARTMENT</p>
<p>Boy did they get it right. The Apartment  is a masterpiece and a peak for all involved, including director 
Billy Wilder and actors Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. Besides any of the other movies would have 
been dreadful picks, with the possible exception of Elmer Gantry,  which would merely have been foolish. 
Oscar had only once chance to get it right and they might have easily overlooked one of the best movies ever made. Remarkably, they didn’t.   
1959: Ben-Hur beat Anatomy of a MurderThe Diary of Anne FrankThe Nun’s Story Room at the TopWe say: ANATOMY OF A MURDERI like the stolid Ben-Hur  and three others are a snooze so it’s not a bad pick. Happily, that leaves Anatomy 
Of A Murder.  Director Otto Preminger gets his due alongside an all-star cast led by Jimmy Stewart in a 
story of rape that fascinates because it gets the details right. Lawyers admire the hell out of this one and 
no wonder. Plus, it’s got a great jazzy score by the great Duke Ellington. First class all the way.
1958: Gigi beat Auntie MameCat on a Hot Tin RoofThe Defiant Ones Separate TablesWe say: SEPARATE TABLESI’m tempted to say NO WINNER for this year’s batch but I’ll settle for the very polite Separate Tables,  
which merged two Terrence Rattigan plays into one film with fine results all around. It’s certainly superior 
to Gigi, one of the worst move musicals created by a team of the renown of Lerner & Lowe. (I mean, they 
did My Fair Lady  and Camelot , for pete’s sake!) Gigi  is creepy and why anyone was beguiled by it escapes
 
me entirely.
1957: The Bridge on the River Kwai beat</p>
<p>12 Angry Men
Peyton PlaceSayonaraWitness for the Prosecution We say: 12 ANGRY MENI really like The Bridge On The River Kwai  but David Lean has already won Oscar’s biggest prize and will 
again, both times for better films. So let’s honor 12 Angry Men.  It’s a corker of a movie with Henry Fonda 
pretty unbeatable as a juror trying to convince everyone else that justice must be done, even if they’re hot 
and tired and would rather be anywhere else except serving on a trial. Further, it shows Oscar acknowledging the great work being done in live TV and how the talent cutting their teeth there (like Sidney Lumet) are welcome in Hollywood.   
1956: Around the World in Eighty Days beat Friendly PersuasionGiantThe King and IThe Ten Commandments We say: THE TEN COMMANDMENTSWhat a dreadful bore of five nominees. (What did they ignore? Just The Searchers .) But if Hollywood is 
going to honor the last gasp of the studio system, at least let it honor the legendary Cecil B. De Mille and 
The Ten Commandments,  which has a wink in its eye while delivering the story of Moses with all the sex 
and violence and spectacle that decency will allow. Even the people who made Around The World In Eighty Days  didn’t like it. It’s the worst of the five by a country mile.   
1955: Marty beat 
Love Is a Many-Splendored ThingMister RobertsPicnic</p>
<p>The Rose Tattoo 
We say: MISTER ROBERTSYeah, yeah, Marty  is the adorable underdog. Tough. I’m gonna save my salute to TV for 12 Angry Men  and 
that means honoring Mister Roberts.  This is old school Hollywood of the respectable sort. Hugely 
entertaining and a bit stodgy but I can only choose from the stuff they nominated and this is the cream of 
the crop. Plus it costars Jack Lemmon, so there’s that.   
1954: On the Waterfront beat The Caine MutinyThe Country GirlSeven Brides for Seven BrothersThree Coins in the Fountain We say: ON THE WATERFRONTThey got it right.  The Caine Mutiny  is the only sane option and it’s not remotely on the same level.  
1953: From Here to Eternity beat Julius CaesarRoman HolidayShaneThe Robe We say: SHANEWe can’t keep saying “they got it right.” This is the Alternative Oscars, after all. It’s hard to argue with 
From Here To Eternity  and Frank Sinatra would beat the crap out of me for taking away his film’s Best 
Picture win. (Though it’s more likely he’d get one of his bodyguards to do it for him.) Nonetheless, it does have a little aura of importance that’s deadly for a film, not to mention dealing with disreputable issues in  a manner so polite and discreet it’s a little silly. So I’m going to plunk for the flawed but compelling western Shane,  the last great role for Alan Ladd. Mind you, if Oscar had picked Shane  I would gladly be 
naming From Here To Eternity  and chiding their lack of taste. So this is a close call.</p>
<p>1952: The Greatest Show on Earth beat 
High NoonIvanhoeMoulin RougeThe Quiet Man We say: THE QUIET MANOy. Not until Around The World In Eighty Days  would Oscar honor a movie so inherently boring as this one.
 
They only had two chances to get it right: the western High Noon  or the romantic drama The Quiet Man. 
High Noon  is actually a bit of a pill; see it once and you’re most assuredly done. The Quiet Man  however is 
a peak for director John Ford and showcases the appeal of John Wayne like never before. Toss in 
Maureen O’Hara and her fiery red hair, a wonderful supporting cast, some of the most gorgeous scenery ofthe Irish countryside you’ll ever see and a memorable score I’m starting to hum even as I type this and you’ve got what we call in the business a classic.
1951: An American in Paris beat Decision Before DawnA Place in the SunQuo Vadis A Streetcar Named DesireWe say: A PLACE IN THE SUNI really am not a fan of Gene Kelly’s arty dance movies and the dull film An American In Paris  is a prime 
example. Give me Fred Astaire’s unassuming grace any day. And the movies based on Tennessee 
Williams’ plays all suffer from cutting the more scandalous elements so they could make it past the censors. (Which begs the question of why no one is making new films of those plays using the original text
 
— we’ve certainly got actresses like Cate Blanchett and Gillian Anderson pulling it off onstage.) Luckily, we’ve got a tremendous Hollywood drama in our back pocket. Director George Stevens would get real world Oscar nominations for movies like Shane  and Giant  and The Diary Of Anne Frank  but he deservedly 
won for this one. Montgomery Clift is married to the harridan Shelley Winters (wonderfully hateful) but he wants to be with Elizabeth Taylor. Can you blame him? Would anyone really mind if they just sort of drowned her? Clift and Taylor at this particular moment in time are the two most beautiful people on the</p>
<p>planet and arguably the two most beautiful people who would ever walk the face of the earth. (Let’s not 
downplay how much sex appeal is part of Hollywood’s allure.) It’s a magnetic film with the audience knowing that of course they shouldn’t  be rooting for the lovers to get away with this terrible scheme...and 
yet doing so anyway. 
1950: All About Eve beat Born YesterdayFather of the BrideKing Solomon’s MinesSunset Blvd. We say: ALL ABOUT EVEActually, Father Of The Bride  is a treat and Judy Holliday deserved to win for her never to be equalled ditzy
turn in Born Yesterday.  Not a bad crop, really. (The less said about King Solomon’s Mines  the better.) But 
really you’ve got two masterpieces vying against one another for Best Picture. Either one is a credit to the 
industry and a worthy Oscar winner. It would be easy to swap out Sunset Blvd.  and who could object? But 
the gothic horror of the Billy Wilder film is slightly less perfect than the bitchy treat that is All About Eve,  
so we’ll stick with it.   
1949: All the King’s Men beat BattlegroundThe HeiressA Letter to Three WivesTwelve O’Clock High We say: THE HEIRESSNot a bad one in the bunch really. But it comes down to the brilliant A Letter To Three Wives  and the 
equally brilliant play adaptation The Heiress.  I’m giving the edge to The Heiress  because it improves on the
play at the crushing finale in a way the play couldn’t match. Plus it has Montgomery Clift as the gentleman 
caller and while you know you shouldn’t believe him you just can’t help yourself, can you? Ralph Richardson is hateful as the father who can’t love his daughter. And frankly I never saw Olivia de Havilland as a romantic lead so it made perfect sense to me that she would be cast as a plain, dull overlooked child.</p>
<p>(It’s not like the travesty of casting Michelle Pfeiffer in Frankie & Johnnie,  for example.) Besides, I’ve taken 
away three of director William Wyler’s wins for Best Picture so I’m giving one back here.   
1948: Hamlet beat Johnny BelindaThe Red ShoesThe Snake PitThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre We say: THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADREMy heart belongs to the great British team of Powell and Pressburger, but The Red Shoes  is one of their 
rare films I’m not wildly enamored by. (Sorry, Marty!) So let’s stick with John Huston’s memorable film 
about the lust for gold. It’s surely a lot more fun than Laurence Olivier’s self-consciously tony Hamlet .   
1947: Gentleman’s Agreement beat 
The Bishop’s Wife CrossfireGreat ExpectationsMiracle on 34th StreetWe say: GREAT EXPECTATIONSGentleman’s Agreement  is an Important Film about anti-Semitism. While apparently it’s a lesson that 
needs to be learned again every generation, that doesn’t make this bore of a film starring Gregory Peck 
any better. (”But would you rent me a room in your hotel if I told you I was a JEW?” is the sort of line Peck has to intone at restaurants and hotels throughout the movie.) Miracle On 34th Street  is a sweet little film 
but we just honored a holiday movie one year ago. Great Expectations  is simply a masterpiece, an early 
peak for director David Lean featuring an opening scene that is a textbook example of great filmmaking. It happens to have great source material (thanks, Charles Dickens!) but it helps even more to have a great technical team and a superlative cast with even small roles anchored by the likes of Alec Guinness and the
 
great Francis L. Sullivan. Favoring Gentleman’s Agreement  over this is Hollywood back-patting at its 
worst.
1946: The Best Years of Our Lives beat</p>
<p>Henry V
It’s a Wonderful LifeThe Razor’s EdgeThe Yearling We say: IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFENow mind you, most critics consider The Best Years of Our Lives  a peak film from director William Wyler. 
Clearly it struck a nerve and captured something about life in the US at the end of the war; the movie was a
monster box office hit (only Gone With The Wind  was bigger) and swept the Oscars. It’s admirable for 
using a real-life veteran to play a major character. And many scenes are tastefully done and often moving, like the near silent beauty where Frederic March returns home unannounced from overseas and surprises his wife Myrna Loy. For all that, it’s always left me a little cold. So I won’t hesitate to name Frank Capra’s It’s A Wonderful Life  as the best film of 1946. At the time it made decent box office but not nearly enough 
to break even. Reviews were pretty mixed (especially given Frank Capra’s record) but some were strong. Of course, the film might have won the Oscar outright if it hadn’t rushed to come out in December of 1946 to make the awards cutoff, since the following year was notably weaker. And as you know TV reruns and being in the public domain have proven its savior. That only means the public has caught up to what I imagine critics would have recognized long ago: this is a dark, dark film with a lot more hard-hitting despair than the warm sentiment at the end that everyone remembers. Yes, that sentiment is there, but boy does Jimmy Stewart have to earn it.   
1945: The Lost Weekend beat Anchors AweighMildred PierceSpellboundThe Bells of St. Mary’s We say: MILDRED PIERCEThe Lost Weekend  is another Important Film, like Gentleman’s Agreement.  This time Hollywood is 
exposing the dangers of alcoholism. Good for them! Just don’t name it the Best Picture of the year. That 
leaves The Bells Of St. Mary’s  and Mildred Pierce. Bells  is one of the great sequels of all time and far less 
bloody than The Godfather Part II.  Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman are so appealing as a priest and a nun</p>
<p>that I imagine they alone kept vocations soaring for a decade or so. I hate to disappoint the great Leo 
McCarey but I’m going to go for the tough-minded women’s film Mildred Pierce.  It’s helmed by my favorite
studio director — Michael Curtiz — and the unlikely screen legend Joan Crawford has never been better. Has an actor so inherently unappealing ever proven such a star? Bette Davis comes close but she never asked you to identify with her, while Crawford craved approval. It’s as if every person who ever felt unlucky or unloved got their revenge by identifying with Crawford and simply pretending  she was a 
glamorous, likable figure. Remarkable and in this film it works brilliantly.    
1944: Going My Way beat Double IndemnityGaslightSince You Went AwayWilson We say: DOUBLE INDEMNITYOh how tempted I am to leave Going My Way  right where it is. Bing Crosby is charm itself as a traveling 
priest who comes to a parish, sings a few songs and makes everything better. Who could fear Catholics 
after seeing it? But surely the cynical Double Indemnity  deserves the top award even more. It’s a simple 
fact that cynicism ages a lot better than optimism or its kissing cousin earnestness. And Double Indemnity  
has cynicism in spades. For those who knew Fred MacMurray from the mild sitcom My Three Sons,  
discovering this film on late night TV was head-spinning. Thanks to director Billy Wilder, he pulls it off. (Frankly, seeing all his other films before and after, I still wouldn’t have thought he had it in him!) He’s great, Edward G. Robinson is great and of course Barbara Stanwyck is great too. I hate to admit it, but I think Stanwyck has replaced Katharine Hepburn as my favorite actress of all time.   
1943: Casablanca beat For Whom the Bell TollsHeaven Can WaitThe Human ComedyIn Which We ServeMadame Curie</p>
<p>The More the Merrier
The Ox-Bow IncidentThe Song of BernadetteWatch on the Rhine We say: CASABLANCAWell, duh.     1942: Mrs. Miniver beat 49th ParallelKings RowThe Magnificent AmbersonsThe Pied PiperThe Pride of the YankeesRandom HarvestThe Talk of the TownWake IslandYankee Doodle DandyWe say: THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONSMrs. Miniver  is the greatest piece of propoganda ever made. (Yes, even better than Triumph Of the Will. ) 
It’s also a fun movie with the added spice of knowing star Greer Garson would marry the actor playing her 
son just one year later. Winston Churchill loved it and Hitler hated it and that should be good enough for anyone. But half the fun of Alternative Oscars is the What If factor. What if foreign films started winning Best Picture right away? What if animated movies snagged the top prize? What if Orson Welles had seen his debut honored rightly as the Best Picture of the year? Maybe he would have had more clout with the studios and not abandoned Ambersons  or at least not seen it butchered in his absence. Screen history 
might have been very different indeed. Even in its truncated form ( I still await a final reel to pop up somewhere so it can be restored), Ambersons  is a remarkable movie and wholly satisfying. If nothing else,</p>
<p>it reminds us that Joseph Cotten is easily one of the most underrated actors in film history. Light comedy, 
dark drama and everything in between — like Jimmy Stewart, Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, he could do it all.   
1941: How Green Was My Valley beat Blossoms in the DustCitizen KaneHere Comes Mr. JordanHold Back the DawnThe Little FoxesThe Maltese Falcon One Foot in HeavenSergeant YorkSuspicionWe say: CITIZEN KANEThe consensus choice for the best film of all time and who am I to argue. (A recent poll put Vertigo  at the 
top but frankly Vertigo  isn’t even the best film by Alfred Hitchcock.) Again, cinematic history might have 
gone off the rails the night this was dissed. On the other hand, Orson Welles did  win an Oscar for Best 
Screenplay and had a free rein with his next film so he was probably self-destructive anyway. I mean, a 
guy who enjoys unmatched success as a child and then in radio and then on stage and then in film? Well, there’s nowhere to go but down.
1940: Rebecca beat All This and Heaven TooForeign CorrespondentThe Grapes of WrathThe Great Dictator</p>
<p>Kitty Foyle
The LetterThe Long Voyage HomeOur TownThe Philadelphia StoryWe say: THE PHILADELPHIA STORYReally? Alfred Hitchcock delivers a string of matchless entertainments from the UK and then comes to the 
US and arguably tops himself here? And the one  movie Hollywood honors is the atypical and not very 
interesting Rebecca?  Heck, it’s not even my favorite Hitchcock film nominated for Best Picture this year!  
(That would be the drum-beating propaganda film Foreign Correspondent  starring the great stone-faced 
Joel McCrea.) And what else is on the list? Just one of Hollywood’s peak achievements in romantic comedy, the absolutely delightful triumph The Philadelphia Story.  It turned Katharine Hepburn from “box 
office poison” to a Hollywood legend now and forever. Director George Cukor and co-stars Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart are all in peak form here. It manages to be family friendly and yet sophisticated adult entertainment all at the same time, one of the glories of the studio system at its best. Shockingly, not on the list is another romantic comedy every bit its equal: The Shop Around The Corner.  
1939: Gone with the Wind beat 
Dark VictoryGoodbye Mr. ChipsLove AffairMr. Smith Goes to WashingtonNinotchkaOf Mice and MenStagecoachThe Wizard of OzWuthering Heights</p>
<p>We say: MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON
Maybe you’re shocked but most critics and certainly most film historians would put a big fat asterisk next 
to Gone With The Wind,  one of the great technical achievements of Hollywood and beautifully acted but 
little better than the more virulently racist Birth Of A Nation  in its distortion of history. (In fact, by making 
that prejudice go down sweeter, it’s even worse than Birth Of A Nation .) But hold on, hold on! Putting 
aside politics and decency, most film critics would also say that there are better, more influential movies than GWTW in 1939. The Wizard Of Oz  was a groundbreaker in terms of fantasy and musicals. If you loved 
those 1970s disaster flicks and Die Hard  and a ton of other similar films, they owe a huge debt to 
Stagecoach , which served as a template for every movie that showed a microcosm of society trapped in a
 
life or death situation (the hero,the coward, the cynical observer, the love interest and so on). Plus it turnedJohn Wayne into a star. Bette Davis holds forth in Dark Victory  to great effect. And while I don’t think 
Ninotchka  holds up on repeated viewings (Ernst Lubitsch made many better ones, including next year’s 
The Shop Around The Corner ) it is a great deal of fun to see Garbo laugh. Wuthering Heights  is notable 
and it’s easy to see why Love Affair  has been remade so many times and yes, Goodbye Mr Chips  tugs at 
the heart. (Shamelessly.) Yes, there’s a reason 1939 is often cited as the greatest year for the studio system in movie history. But I’m going to go with Mr. Smith Goes To Washington  because Stagecoach  
simply wouldn’t have had the gravitas to beat GWTW  even in the Alternative Oscars. Mr. Smith is Frank 
Capra at his absolute best. For a director often derided as cornpone and with a sentimental streak a mile wide, you have to wonder exactly how he got that reputation. His films are clear-eyed and nobody’s fool when it comes to the corruption that can corrode politics and our democracy as a whole. Meet John Doe. It’s A Wonderful Life. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.  These are powerful and dangerous films — at least 
they are dangerous to the people in power. As usual, a timeless classic like this can speak to us today loudand clear.   
1938: You Can’t Take it With You beat Alexander’s Ragtime BandBoys TownFour DaughtersGrand IllusionJezebelPygmalionTest PilotThe Adventures of Robin Hood</p>
<p>The Citadel
We say: THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOODYou Can’t Take It With You  is based on the hugely acclaimed play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart 
about a family of adorable eccentrics. Neither the play nor the film has aged well in the least. Most critics 
—and Woody Allen — consider Grand Illusion  one of the greatest films of all time. It’s an easy choice to 
stake a claim that the Oscars should have recognized international films right from the start. But try as I might, I’ve never taken to it. There’s something about its attitude towards the aristocracy that doesn’t sit well with me. ”Sure, it’s a war, but we’re both gentlemen and can rise above that” is the vibe between Jean
 
Gabin and his German captor Erich von Stroheim. To me, it romanticizes war, though I know that’s not the intent or how most people see it. I enjoy many Jean Renoir films but not this one. Besides, I can wholeheartedly endorse my favorite studio director Michael Curtiz and the unalloyed joys of The Adventures Of Robin Hood.  Errol Flynn is Robin of Locksley now and forever but the entire cast is pitch 
perfect. A great villain in Basil Rathbone and a hiss-ably fun one in Claude Rains, terrific action scenes, humor, romance and a classic sword fight at the finale! It just doesn’t get any more entertaining than this. I understand why people keep retelling this tale but I don’t think they’ll ever match it, much less do better. I can imagine  it, a Robin Hood  rooted in the real world and burning with the injustice of it all, one with 
tension and danger and without the certainty that the hero (especially when embodied by Errol Flynn) was NOT going to die. But they haven’t done it yet.  
1937: The Life of Emile Zola beat The Awful TruthCaptains CourageousDead EndThe Good Earth In Old ChicagoLost HorizonOne Hundred Men and a GirlStage DoorA Star Is BornWe say: 
THE AWFUL TRUTH</p>
<p>Hey, director Leo McCarey! We robbed you with Going My Way  so here’s our make-good. The Awful Truth  
is a delightful screwball comedy with that tried and true device of a married couple who are going to be 
divorced or get divorced or somehow were never married at all but love each other madly, even if they won’t admit it until the final reel. In this case it’s Cary Grant and Irene Dunne determined  to get a divorce 
but also determined to make sure the other has no successful romantic interest in anyone else. This film put the stamp on Cary Grant as “Cary Grant” once and for all and since along with Spencer Tracy he’s probably the greatest actor of them all, that’s saying something. McCarey actually won the Oscar for Best Director and he claimed he won it for the wrong movie that year.  And he was right: Make Way For Tomorrow  is a superlative heart-tugger about an elderly couple who are deeply in love but must live apart 
for financial reasons. You can’t watch The Awful Truth  without laughing and you can’t watch Make Way 
For Tomorrow  without crying. Now that’s a director!
1936: The Great Ziegfeld beat 
A Tale of Two CitiesAnthony AdverseDodsworthLibeled LadyMr. Deeds Goes to TownRomeo and JulietSan FranciscoThe Story of Louis PasteurThree Smart GirlsWe say: DODSWORTHThis is where Oscar really started to go wrong, believing that dull bio-pics like The Great Ziegfeld  and the 
even worse one-two punch of this year’s nominee The Story Of Louis Pasteur  and next year’s winner The 
Life Of Emile Zola  (both starring the dull as dishwater Paul Muni) were what Oscar should be about. God 
help us all. Let’s celebrate instead the subtle work of Walter Huston in Dodsworth . He plays an 
unsophisticated but kind business tycoon who sets off on a Grand Tour of Europe with his wife at the end 
of his career. They both discover that — now that he’s actually retired and spending time with her — well they have absolutely nothing in common, don’t even really like each other and want very different things in</p>
<p>life. (What? He couldn’t have noticed that on the weekends?) She wants a divorce and cheats on him. It’s 
all very adult and quietly devastating thanks to Huston, who is recreating his stage triumph. 
1935: Mutiny on the Bounty — beat Alice AdamsBroadway Melody of 1936Captain Blood David CopperfieldThe InformerThe Lives of a Bengal LancerA Midsummer Night’s DreamLes Misérables Naughty MariettaRuggles of Red GapTop HatWe say: TOP HATSee? Everything old is new again, since you’ve realized now that for many years the Academy Awards 
honored about ten films every year before switching to five and the more recent sliding scale approach. Mutiny On The Bounty  is an honorable choice, as would be David Copperfield, Captain Blood, Alice 
Adams  and the Bounty’s  closest competitor The Informer.  But we must crown Top Hat,  the most popular 
film in the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers library. Some say the choreography in 1936’s Swing Time  is even 
better and certainly if it were nominated we would have chosen that over Dodsworth . But we play the hand
 
we’re dealt by the Academy and that means Top Hat.  Since that also means celebrating song and dance 
perfection like “Top Hat, White Tie And Tails” and “Cheek To Cheek,” we can live with that. It’s all stuff and  
nonsense, delightfully so and just the sort of tonic to help you forget the country was still in the throes of the Depression. 
1934: It Happened One Night — beat Cleopatra</p>
<p>Flirtation Walk
Here Comes the NavyImitation of LifeOne Night of LoveThe Barretts of Wimpole StreetThe Gay DivorceeThe House of RothschildThe Thin ManThe White ParadeViva Villa!We say: THE THIN MANOnly three films in history have swept the Big Five at the Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, 
Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay). They are The Silence Of The Lambs, One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest  and the best of the bunch by a mile, It Happened One Night.  It deserves its place in film 
history and movies don’t get much more influential than this road trip romance. I love it. But director Frank Capra will win it all in 1939, the greatest year for movies in history. Besides, the Alternative Oscars tries to resist endorsing what actually happened whenever possible. There’s another movie on this line that I would argue is equally if not MORE influential and that’s the peerless comic mystery The Thin Man.  William
 
Powell and Myrna Loy remain my image for what married life can and should be (with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn a close second). And boy could they drink! Loy is a great gal and Powell is (just barely) her match in this charmer about a wealthy couple that stumble into one mystery after another. Yes, the second film in the series is even better but it’s all here from the start and their banter/good-natured sparring has been copied again and again in a thousand films and tv shows.  
1932-33: Cavalcade — beat 42nd StreetA Farewell to ArmsI Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</p>
<p>Lady for a Day
Little WomenShe Done Him WrongSmilin’ ThroughState FairThe Private Life of Henry VIIIWe say: LITTLE WOMENI want to honor 42nd Street,  a dazzling early musical with great choreography by Busby Berkeley and an 
archetypal storyline that have since launched a thousand imitators. Its influence is inestimable. But the 
greater film is director George Cukor’s triumph with Little Women.  Katharine Hepburn was born to play the 
irrepressible Jo Marsh but the entire cast is perfectly in tune with the material and you can’t fault a single element of the production. Hepburn is one of the greatest stage and screen stars of all time and her legend
 
starts here, not with the more melodramatic Morning Glory  that came out this same year. 
1931-32: Grand Hotel — beat 
ArrowsmithBad GirlFive Star FinalOne Hour with YouShanghai ExpressThe ChampThe Smiling LieutenantWe say: SHANGHAI EXPRESSGrand Hotel  is a lot of fun, very influential (you can blame it for The Love Boat  and a thousand similar TV 
shows and movies over the years, for starters) and inspired a musical I wish I’d seen. But it’s not nearly as 
good as the novel it’s based on.  Others have their appeal like the overlooked Bad Girl  and Five Star Final  
and the weepy Jackie Cooper flick The Champ . But the two giants battling it out are Garbo and Dietrich in</p>
<p>Grand Hotel  and Shanghai Express  and the latter is clearly the winner. It was also the highest grossing film  
of the year, which is a bit of a surprise since it’s never enjoyed the same visibility since. Shanghai Express  
is a terrific drama set in China in 1931 while the country is embroiled in civil war. Dietrich is a famous 
courtesan (i.e. high priced hooker) who unexpectedly meets up again with her true love on the titular train. “It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily,” Dietrich states bluntly in one of the film’s most memorable lines. The movie is very smart and modern on race, politics and feminist issues. Josef von Sternberg directed and — according to Dietrich — is mostly responsible for the film’s remarkable cinematography, among the most dazzling in history. That alone makes this a must see. 
1930-31: Cimarron — beat East LynneSkippyThe Front PageTrader HornWe say: THE FRONT PAGEThat was a close one! Very early on in Oscar history we might have had to declare No Winner. Cimarron  
has a great land rush scene and a lot of ugly stereotypes and is generally dated. Almost no one has seen 
East Lynne  since and the kiddie flick Skippy  is similarly invisible for the most part. Trader Horn  is 
problematic for about a hundred reasons (animals were treated cruelly and film crew members killed while making this tale of hunters in Africa). So thank goodness for that ode to ink-stained wretches The Front Page.  You know it’s already a big improvement on the stodgy stage play because the film is about an hour
 
shorter. Sure it was vastly improved when they remade it as 1940’s His Girl Friday  (shockingly, not even 
nominated that year!). But even this first stab at the story (lauded in its day) is easily the best option on thetable.  
1929-30: All Quiet on the Western Front — beat DisraeliThe DivorceeThe Big HouseThe Love Parade We say: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT</p>
<p>They got it right.
1928-29: The Broadway Melody — beat* AlibiIn Old ArizonaThe Hollywood Revue of 1929The Patriot(*unofficial nominees deemed by AMPAS)We say: IN OLD ARIZONABy and large, these five films have been lost in the mists of time. The winner of the Oscar is the best-
preserved of the bunch though its rushed final sequence (shot in color) is gone. Alibi  sounds interesting 
and I’d sure love to see Ernst Lubitch’s lost drama The Patriot , staring Emil Jannings. The Hollywood 
Revue Of 1929  is exactly what it sounds like, an MGM grab bag of stars performing this or that number, 
with Laurel and Hardy doing a bit and a game Joan Crawford singing and dancing. The western In Old Arizona helped cement the idea of the singing cowboy, though sadly a freak accident with a jackrabbit left Raoul Walsh with only one eye and he gave up his acting career to stick behind the camera. (Mind you, he was a great director, so it’s not too sad.) Since I’ve seen both it and The Broadway Melody  and since In 
Old Arizona is better, that gets my vote.  But I was strongly tempted to give no award.
1927-28: Wings — (best picture, production) beat7th HeavenThe Racket andSunrise: A Song of Two Humans — (best picture, unique and artistic production) beat Chang: A Drama of the WildernessThe CrowdWe say: SUNRISESo even at the very start, Hollywood got it wrong. At the very first Academy Awards, they gave out two</p>
<p>Best Picture Oscars. One went to the silent film spectacle Wings , a movie like Titanic  that was hailed more 
for its effects than its story. (Also like Titanic , it was hugely expensive at $2 million.) Nonetheless, the film 
did launch the career of Gary Cooper and featured nudity and two male friends kissing (somewhat) 
chastely, making it a landmark in numerous ways. The aerial photography remains amazing. The other Oscar for Best Picture was given to Sunrise  for “unique and artistic production.” In other words, right from 
the start Hollywood was saying ok, yeah, here’s your art but here’s the film that’ll wow ‘em. To add insult to injury, the following year they said, “Never mind that Oscar for Sunrise . The Best Picture was Wings , 
period.” Ever since you’ll hear Wings  mentioned as the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture 
and nary a mention of Sunrise . You won’t be surprised I imagine to hear that they got it wrong. Sunrise  
directed by F.W. Murnau is by far the better film and often named as one of the greatest silent films in history. It’s gorgeously shot, deeply moving and just as powerful today. Damn near as good and a masterpiece in its own right is King Vidor’s marvelously humane film The Crowd.  They’re both proof that 
Hollywood was making great films right from the start. So no wonder they decided to create an award to pat themselves on the back.  Every other artistic endeavor has followed suit with the likes of the Tony, the Emmy and the Grammy. And just like the rest of them, it’s a shame that so often the Academy Awards getsit wrong.
