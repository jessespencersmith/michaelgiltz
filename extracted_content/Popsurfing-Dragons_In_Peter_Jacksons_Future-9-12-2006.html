            <p>T U E S D AY,  S E P T E M B E R  1 2 ,  2 0 0 6Dragons In Peter Jackson's Future?In London, they're auditioning hobbits for the stage musical version of"The Lord of the Rings." It flopped in Toronto, closing three monthsearly. Now it's opening early next year, with the show shortened andtightened and otherwise fiddled with.Meanwhile, MGM says they HOPE Peter Jackson does the movieversion of "The Hobbit" they want. But what project is Jackson actuallydeveloping? Along with "The Lovely Bones," (the book he optioned andis working on a screenplay with his partners on), Jackson has justoptioned the Temeraire series of books by Naomi Novik. These cleverbooks (she's written three) envision the Napoleonic Wars in a worldwhere dragons exist. Combine dragons with naval battles and you aretalking a VERY expensive movie. The books are solid fare for fantasybuffs, with the first one okay and the second two improving on the ideain every way. It's easy to see why Jackson would be interested.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

2  C O M M E N T S :Jimmy said...This is very, very cool! If there was one director that seems perfect tobring these wonderful books to the silver screen, its Peter Jackson. Nomatter the project he works on, Jackson shows respect for the sourcematerial. We certainly saw that in the Lord of the Rings and to someextent in King Kong, which paid homage to the original film and itsperiod. I'm not sure what the box office potential is for the novels, butthey couldn't be in better hands.5:15 PM 
Michael in New York said...Have you read all three? I thought they really improved in complexityin books two and three. I think the movie potential is huge -- since theyhave thrilling battle seasons and of course dragons. It's definitely aspectacle. Jackson will have great fun with it if he sticks with theproject and directs. It's the sort of popcorn movie Spielberg used to doNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
