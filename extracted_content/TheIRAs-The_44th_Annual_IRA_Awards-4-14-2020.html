The 44th Annual IRA Awards -- "Capernaum"
Triumphs
The 44st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2018
Releases
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society launched in 1976
when it proudly named Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon  the best film
of the previous year. Officially known as the New York Independent
Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs -- they are
more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial
than the LA Film Critics and more loyal to their favorites than the
Golden Globes. The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best
movies released commercially in New York City in 2018.
The IRAs are also proud to announce a change in its rule to determine
eligibility. Rolling with the times and acknowledging how IRA
members and the world are accessing more movies in more ways than
ever before (streaming, VOD, DVD, theatrical and so on), the IRAs
adopted a new standard. Eligibility for 2020 voting: If a movie becomes
available to IRA members in any way on any platform (theatrical
distribution, DVD, on demand, streaming, etc.) in the previous
calendar year, a member may vote for it. Festival play alone, however,
does not qualify. Steven Spielberg may be freaked out over Netflix, but
we've seen the future and it's actually the present. Rest assured, IRA
members love nothing more than heading to their local multiplex, art
house or drive-in, sit in a darkened space with a crowd of strangers and
watch a new or classic film. Access on your TV is great, but the silver
screen is greater.
Without further ado, the IRA goes to...

In 2018, the IRAs  had a flood of new members, perhaps the most ever
in one year. Illness and life prevented all four members from returning
again, but happily two braved this querulous, quarrelsome group a
second time. In all, twelve members were present physically or virtually
(IRA member Greg beamed in by satellite, a la Max Headroom), with
the titular IRA member Ira maintaining his non-voting status on the
current year but weighing in boldly with support for the rule change on
eligibility while offering gnomic, pointed and hard to argue with
comments when moved to do so. (His favorite film of all-time?
Vertigo! ) In short, eleven members weighed in on the films of 2018.
The atmosphere -- to this observer -- was a tad more collegial than
usual, which certainly isn't in the IRA tradition. Are the new members
too nice? Will they become more embittered and venomous as life
crushes their hopes and aspirations or the repeated asinine voting of
others weighs more heavily on their cinematic conscience? We shall
see.
And now a blow-by-blow description of the night, in order of voting.
We begin, as always, with th4e category of Best Costumes and the first
voter of the night, Ira. He was dressed nattily in suspenders but passed
on voting in this category. The IRA goes to...
BEST COSTUME
1. Caroline Eselin for If Beale Street Could Talk  -- 34 pts. (out
of a possible 55 pts.)
2. Mary E. Vogt for  Crazy Rich Asians  -- 21 pts.
3. Sandy Powell for  The Favourite and Mary Poppins Returns --
20 pts.
4. Mitchell Travers for Eighth Grade,  The Strange Ones -- 17 pts.
5. Jenny Eagan for American Animals, Hostiles, Widows-- 10 pts.
POINT OF ORDER: This year eleven ballots were in play. With a top
score for each nominee of 5 pts, the maximum any one nominee could
achieve in any category was 55 pts.
NOTE: Half the fun of the IRAs is trying to figure out in advance which
films might be contending, politic for your favorite (or favourite) and
block the one you like least by talking it down or simply ignoring the
offending flick altogether. (That film? Hardly worth discussing, you
sniff.) This year, I imagined the widely admired If Beale Street Could
Talk  and the contentious drama The Favourite  might battle it out all
the way to Best Picture. How wrong I was. Beale Street  easily took the
first prize of the night. The great Sandy Powell was most definitely
honored for her work on The Favourite.  (The IRAs are suckers for
historical costume dramas, esp in tech awards, just like anyone else.)
Mary Poppins Returns  was not liked even on a tech level by most
(those anachronistic bathing suits!), with one notable admirer.
Similarly, Mitchell Travers earned votes for Eighth Grade  (that bathing
suit!) not the little seen sci-fi flick  The Strange Ones, which also had
one admiring viewer. Finally, Jenny Eagan was lauded essentially for
American Animals , though her work on the period western Hostiles
and the crime drama Widows  certainly demonstrates her versatility. In
general, a nominee is lauded for all their work in a calendar year unless
voters specifically exclude work on one or more films -- this, but not
that! --  when voting.
BEST EDITING
1. Nick Fenton, Chris Gill and Julian Hart  for American Animals   --
26 pts.
2. Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders for If Beale Street Could Talk -- 24
pts.
3. Bob Murawski and Orson Welles for The Other Side Of The Wind --
15 pts.
4. Hirokazu Kore-eda for  Shoplifters, The Third Murder  -- 11 pts.
5. Da-won Kim and Hyun Kim for  Burning  -- 9 pts.
NOTE: When editing was added to the list of categories that the IRAs
vote on, some concern arose it might be dominated by nonfiction films.
Even though many docs have a script, by nature they are often
discovered after filming has ended. Well, for the second year in a row
no nonfiction film made the editing list. But arguments continue about
this addition, for change comes slowly and contentiously to the IRAs.
Isn't it really the screenplay of American Animals  that's being honored
here, wondered some? And how could the strongly liked doc Minding
The Gap  (which was shot over many years and clearly didn't even exist
until its brilliant editing took place) not appear here at all? No one
disputed the lure of casting another vote for all-time great Orson
Welles: surely the task of pulling together  The Other Side Of The
Wind  after decades of post-production hell was a daunting task. Too
bad the film they cobbled together was such a mess, harrumphed
others.
BEST SCORE/USE OF MUSIC
1. Nicholas Britell  for If Beale Street Could Talk   -- 25 pts.
2. Marcin Masecki for  Cold War -- 19 pts.
3. Anne Nikitin  for American Animals  -- 16 pts.
4. (tie) Aretha Franklin for  Amazing Grace  --10 pts.
    (tie) Michel Legrand for  The Other Side Of The Wind  -- 10 pts.
NOTE: The category of Best Score was recently renamed Best
Score/Use Of Music to accommodate the endless ways in which films
make use of music. This year is a good example why the renaming is
appropriate. If Beale Street has a classic film score that boldly
dominates the audio mix. (It was my favorite aspect of a film I didn't
care for as much as others.) But it also made significant and effective
use of period jazz and pop tunes. Cold War  has no original score. But it
revolves entirely around music, drawing on jazz standards and Polish
folk tunes, re-arranging them for state-approved festivals and then re-
imagining them again for a jazz trio fronted by a female singer and so
on. The credited winner is Marcin Masecki, responsible for the
arrangements used in the film. Yet clearly writer-director Pawel
Pawlikowski embedded music in this film's DNA. Ignoring it just
because it had no composer for a traditional score would be foolish.
The just-deceased legend Michel Legrand grabbed his last IRA nod just
in time with the Orson Welles project. Finally, Aretha Franklin? Well,
no one was more responsible for how music was used in the
documentary/concert film Amazing Grace  than the late queen of soul
herself.
BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN
1. Eugenio Caballero  for Roma -- 26 pts.
2. Justin Thompson for  Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse -- 20 pts.
3. Benoît Barouh, Marcel Slawinski and Katarzyna Sobanska-
Strzalkowska for  Cold War  -- 19 pts.
4. (tie) Keiko Mitsumatsu for  Shoplifters -- 10 pts.
    (tie) Gary Williamson for  Paddington 2 -- 10 pts.
NOTE: Ah, Roma!  Admired so much by certain IRA members, they
discussed how its overall structure was repeated in individual scenes --
heck, they could teach it to their film students, if only it were shorter.
(A practical consideration.) Its evocation of director Alfonso Cuaron's
childhood won it the top prize for production design. (That garage! So
narrow! The dog poop! So...voluminous!) Many were wowed by the
animated groundbreaker Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse. The look
of that film (which combined multiple styles of animation along with a
comic book aesthetic) might well be its best bet at an IRA yet it fell
short here. And Paddington 2  is not just a whimsical choice: its
adherents spoke strongly for the look, the vocal performance of Ben
Whishaw as the lovable bear (not to mention his fine work on Mary
Poppins Returns   and the film in general. Aaron boldly declared
Paddington 2 the best  film of the year and anyone who disagreed
risked finding themselves in an abandoned train station somewhere far
far away without even a name-tag to help them find their way home
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
1. Alfonso Cuar on for Roma  -- 25 pts.
2. Joshua James Richards for  The Rider  -- 23 pts.
3. Lukasz Zal for  Cold War -- 21 pts.
4. Kyung-pyo Hong for  Burning -- 19 pts.
5. Jimmy Chin for  Free Solo -- 17 pts.
NOTE: Another win for Roma!  Might it take on If Beale Street  at the
end of the night, alongside the rising buzz for American Animals ? I
assumed if The Rider  won anything it would be this award. But this
won't be the last time we hear from that genuinely independent film.
Attention here bode well for both Burning  (very well shot, but this was
not a one-and-done for some great camerawork) and Free Solo,
climbing its way towards contention in Nonfiction Film.
Cinematography proves a rich, world-spanning category indicative of
the wide net cast by the IRAs when it chooses to honor films. Finally, I
can't help noticing the gorgeously shot If Beale Street  doesn't win,
place OR show in this category. A sign of weakness? Finally?
FOOD ALERT: Pizza is ordered.
BEST SCREENPLAY
1. Barry Jenkins  for If Beale Street Could Talk   -- 22 pts.
2. Hirokazu Kore-eda for Shoplifters, The Third Murder -- 15 pts.
3. (tie) Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty for  Can You Ever Forgive
Me?  -- 13 pts.
    (tie) Chloé Zhao for  The Rider  --13 pts.
5. Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman for  Spider-Man: Into The
Spiderverse  -- 12 pts.
NOTE: My faint hope that If Beale Street  was beginning to fade (no
points for cinematography?) are immediately dashed. It triumphs for
Best Screenplay, despite my quickly pointing out to potential voters
that author James Baldwin would  not be showing up to accept the
award on Mr. Jenkins' behalf. More worrisome, when Beale Street  wins
tonight it's usually been winning big, as it does here. Kore-eda had a
banner year with not one but two widely liked movies released
commercially in New York City. Those who saw both insist The Third
Murder  is better, but most IRAnians only saw Shoplifters , which
snagged the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May and proved
a smash hit in his home country of Japan. Nonetheless, writing the
screenplays for two excellent films couldn't sway enough voters to leave
Beale Street. Bubbling under throughout the night was solid
appreciation for the New York-centric Can You Ever Forgive Me?
while The Rider proved it wasn't just a one-trick pony by garnering
points here as well. And yes! The clever screenplay for Spider-Man:
Into The Spiderverse got much deserved attention. Maybe it's not done
yet?
BEST NONFICTION FILM 
1. Won't You Be My Neighbor? -- 27 pts.
2. Three Identical Strangers -- 24 pts.
3. Free Solo -- 20 pts.
4.  Minding The Gap -- 19 pts.
5.  RBG -- 13 pts.
NOTE: The Best Nonfiction Film is a recent add to the IRAs and not
without controversy (of course), since creating a category like this
almost ensures a nonfiction film won't win the much-desired top prize
for Best Film.  Unlike the Oscars, the IRAs wasn't about to ignore nice.
The big winner in a tightly fought category is the heart-warming Won't
You Be My Neighbor? , about the career and impact of children's
television pioneer Mr. Rogers. Heart-warming is normally not a strong
suit of the IRAs (which more often relishes the bitter and angry, thank
you very much). But the balm of this film was too strong in the age of
Trump. Will such appreciation carry over to the performance of Tom
Hanks as the sweater-clad TV host when A Beautiful Day In The
Neighborhood  is released November 21, 2019? Three Identical
Strangers came seemingly out of nowhere to place a close second, with
Free Solo farther back at third, even though everyone involved risked
their lives to make it! Sheesh!  Minding The Gap was a real puzzle. It's
quietly political in its observation of Rockford, Illinois (the hometown
of Andy!) and its economic collapse. It was shot over many years by one
of the participants and clearly came to life in the editing room, with a
great deal to say about class,  gender, passion and the depressingly
common passing down of addiction and abuse and abusive behavior.
And yet, it wasn't even a player, ranking fourth. Ditto RBG , though the
IRAnians certainly send their best wishes to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
expect she will serve on the Supreme Court (and catch up on the best
new films that aren't  about her) for years to come.
FOOD BREAK
Pizza is eaten. Career highlights and lowlights are dissected, looming
marriages are announced (Mazel tov!), career advancements are
planned (tenure, here we come), various medical aches and pains are
probed and so on and so forth. And then action resumes!
BALLOT MEASURES
Change comes slowly to the IRAs but it does happen...after endless,
exhausting debate. Two ballot measures were on deck for
consideration.
1. THE VOTE TO RESCIND  -- a tentative move to consider voting to
rescind the Vote To Rescind option is considered and then dropped by
Andy once he senses little support for the measure. The Vote To
Rescind is offered after every single category is voted on. Once the
totals are in, members may feel the actual winner doesn't reflect the
best choice. Or perhaps they prefer the runner-up. After the winner is
announced, members are asked to consider a Vote To Rescind. If a
majority of the members actively voting support it, the winner is
rescinded and the runner-up is made the official champion. This is
followed by another  vote to rescind until the victor is confirmed. It's a
somewhat controversial tactic. But it rarely comes into play more than
once a year. During the 44th Annual IRAs, not a single victor is
rescinded.
2. CHANGING ELIGIBILITY RULES  -- Since the beginning, the
IRAs have had one rule for eligibility. To qualify for the IRAs, a movie
must have a minimum one-week commercial run in New York City.
This began in 1976, along with the delightful task of keeping track of all
the films that opened in the city at any and every venue. The List was
an essential feature of the IRAs, especially in the pre-Internet era when
keeping track of what movies actually played was difficult. Now of
course, one can go right to IMDB and get a rough sense of when and
where any movie has opened in countries or film festivals all over the
world. More dauntingly, the number of movies opening commercially
in NYC has exploded to some 1000+ titles a year. Further complicating
things, most IRA members don't even live in New York City anymore.
And while members of the IRAs love to go to the movies anywhere and
anytime (to see the latest art house flick or a revival of a classic or really
damn near anything), the truth is that for many years now they have
made full use of DVDs and BluRay and cable and on demand and now
streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and even shared
Vimeo links, all in a desire to see as many of the best films as possible.
And the result of the original rule was that certain films invariably fell
through the cracks or were rejected as ineligible for unimportant
commercial reasons nothing to do with artistry: play Sundance and get
picked up by Amazon and you would usually get a nominal theatrical
release; play Sundance and get picked up by Netflix and you might not.
Why should we care who picks up a movie and how they release it? A
good film is a good film! The issue was debated passionately online and
ultimately festival play was strongly rejected as qualifying. The
following ballot measure was adopted.
ON ELIGIBILITY: If a movie becomes available to us in any way on any
platform (theatrical distribution, DVD, on demand, cable, streaming,
etc.) in the previous calendar year, a member may vote for it. Festival
play alone does not qualify a film for eligibility.
On a 7-5 vote, the ballot measure passed. For the 45th Annual IRAs,
this new standard will determine eligibility.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
1. Regina King for If Beale Street Could Talk   -- 24 pts.
2. Awkwafina for  Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean's 8  -- 22 pts.
3. Kayli Carter for  Private Life -- 13 pts.
4. Amy Adams for Vice -- 12 pts.
5. Nina Arianda for Stan (ampersand) Ollie -- 10 pts.
NOTE: And Beale Street demonstrates again it's one of the most
popular films of the year among IRA voters. Regina King's widely
lauded performance in the film gets recognized here, despite a spirited
campaign for Awkwafina, the best thing in two disparate comedies. The
admiration of Tamara Jenkins and Private Life was solid if modest,
making its biggest mark here with a nod for Carter. And while Vice was
much discussed in the free-for-all known as the IRA email threads, it
came to little except this recognition of Adams as Lynne Cheney.
Because the bio-pic Stan and Ollie  fell through the cracks in terms of
availability, few saw it despite some admiring comments and the allure
of a bio about classic Hollywood stars. The film didn't come out on
DVD until the week of the IRAs and wasn't available on any major
streaming service either (except as a rental). Even with the new rule
change about availability, some movies will get lost in the shuffle.
Technically, its wide availability on DVD and streaming will make Stan
and Ollie  eligible again in 2020, but with a solid, extended commercial
release in theaters at the end of 2018 and into 2019 (in February, it was
playing on 754 screens in North America), it's almost certain the film's
chances have come and gone. By the way, Blogger can't handle the
ampersand symbol and turns it into gobbledygook when one types it.
Hence my insertion of (ampersand) in titles and writing credits when
necessary.)
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
1. Brian Tyree Henry for Hotel Artemis , If Beale Street Could
Talk, Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse, White Boy Rick,
Widows  -- 24 pts.
2. Jonah Hill for  Don't W orry, He W on't Get Far On Foot  -- 19 pts.
3. (tie) Richard E. Grant for  Can You Ever Forgive Me? -- 13 pts.
    (tie) Jake Gyllenhaal for  The Sisters Brothers, Wildlife --13 pts.
5. Steven Yeun for  Burning, Sorry To Bother You -- 10 pts.
NOTE: The Beale Street juggernaut keeps on a rollin'. Brian Tyree
Henry wins for his body of work in 2018. In films good ( If Beale Street
Could Talk, Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse ), ok films ( Widows )
and bad films ( Hotel Artemis  and White Boy Rick ), Henry was the
proverbial best thing in it. Fans of the animated Spider-Man  were
thrilled in particular for his recognition. But Henry probably would
have won this for Beale Street alone, thanks to his powerful
performance of the monologue that serves as the film's beating heart.
Multiple movies that appeared on many best-of lists by IRA voters
enjoyed a moment in the spotlight here: The Sisters Brothers, Wildlife,
Sorry To Bother You, Burning, Can You Ever Forgive Me? and so on.
The IRAs provide a great checklist of movies to watch from the year in
question, especially when you dive deeper than just the winners.
                                            
BEST ACTRESS
1. Sakura Andô for Shoplifters  -- 26 pts.
2. Elsie Fisher for  Eighth Grade-- 22 pts.
3. Thomasin McKenzie for  Leave No Trace -- 20 pts.
4. Melissa McCarthy for  Can You Ever Forgive Me?  --16 pts.
5. Julianne Nicholson for Who We Are Now -- 13 pts.
NOTE: Sakura Andô wins the first award for director Horokazu Kore-
eda's Shoplifters , one of two very good films he released in North
America this year. (She played the would-be mother figure for the gang
of thieves.) My hopes for the terrific debut of Elsie Fisher in Bo
Burnham's marvelous Eighth Grade  were dashed, but just barely. Still,
it gave me some slim hope Burnham and the film might be one of the
contenders to take down the seemingly unstoppable If Beale Street
Could Talk.  Though come to think of it, that film's female lead wasn't
even mentioned in this round. Hmm. Like Eighth Grade (which really
should have won here if it was going to fight for Best Picture), the
movie Leave No Trace  finally got some love with points for its young
star Thomasin McKenzie. Ditto the more established Julianne
Nicholson and her very independent film Who We Are Now.
BEST ACTOR
1. Joaquin Phoenix  for Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot; Mary
Magdalene; The Sisters Brothers; You Were Never Really Here  -- 26 pts.
2. Zain Al Rafeea for  Capernaum  -- 22 pts.
3. Robert Redford for The Old Man And The Gun -- 16 pts.
4. Brady Jandreau for  The Rider  --15 pts.
5. (tie) Ah-in Yoo for  Burning -- 12 pts.
    (tie) Christian Bale for  Vice -- 12 pts.
NOTE: Some award-givers love to recognize actors in a bunch of films -
- it's an easy way to celebrate a lot of different movies and bring more
attention to your awards. (Hey, we liked that cool commercial film,
even if to be honest we're really celebrating this actor's work on that
obscure art film none of you saw. Still!) That's not the IRAs.
Nevertheless, we've got two major acting awards going to two actors
who displayed range and versatility in a clutch of films. Henry won Best
Supporting Actor, though it should be pointed out he appeared in two
films ( If Beale Street  and Spider-Man)  that enjoyed strong support
overall from voters. This is not about quantity over quality. The same is
true for Joaquin Phoenix, who starred in The Sister Brothers
(mentioned a lot if not a big player), You Were Never Really Here  and
Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot.  For good measure, he also
played Jesus in Mary Magdalene .  Phoenix wins Best Actor for the
second time (he won in 2013 for his work on Her) and is honored 27
years after his older brother River won for heartbreakingly good work
on both Dogfight  and My Own Private Idaho.  George boldly declared
Joaquin Phoenix the best actor working today. Phoenix's impressive
year held off strong competition from child actor/refugee Zain Al
Rafeea of Capernaum . An intense, Dardenne-like drama that follows
the journey of a desperate boy in bombed-out Lebanon, Capernaum
depends entirely on the work of Al Rafeea. If this film was going to
triumph anywhere, it was probably here, but the sheer number of
strong performances by Phoenix in multiple good films triumphed on a
technical knockout. At the other end of a career compared to Zain is
Robert Redford, giving a twinkly, this-is-what-a-movie-star-looks-like
turn in the charming flick The Old Man And The Gun.  Not enough IRA
members saw it, sadly. But many saw and admired The Rider,  giving
rodeo rider Brady Jandreau serious attention for his autobiographical
work in that drama. Christian Bale's showy work in Vice  and Ah-In
Yoo's internalized despair in Burning  both brought up the rear for their
deserving turns.
SIDE NOTE: Handling the accounting means I sometimes blow a
chance to make a joke. In my excitement over echoing a vote for Zain, I
forgot to say, "For giving the most enigmatic performance of the year,
where I thought he was the hero but then maybe he was the
villain...Jussie Smollet!" Oh well.
BEST DIRECTOR
1. Nadine Labaki for  Capernaum  -- 23 pts.
2. Chloé Zhao for  The Rider  -- 18 pts.
3. Hirokazu Kore-eda for  Shoplifters, The Third Murder  -- 17 pts.
4. Spike Lee for BlacKKKlansman -- 14 pts.
5. (tie) Debra Granik for  Leave No Trace  -- 11 pts.
    (tie) Adam McKay for  Vice  -- 11 pts.
NOTE: Ok, so the love for Capernaum  wasn't limited to the remarkable
debut of Zain Al Rafeea! Director Nadine Labaki became the first
woman to win Best Director since Nancy Savoca won the 1991 prize for
Household Saints.  (So far, they're the only two to do so for a particular
year, though director Chantal Ackerman is #21 on our all-time best list
with Jeanne Dielman. ) Labaki's victory wasn't by a massive margin but
a five point advantage over the runner-up and the shocking fact that
Barry Jenkins didn't even make the list of honorees despite already
winning five IRAs on the night means this: we've got ourselves a horse
race! And If Beale Street  may not even make it out of the starting gate.
As mentioned, Labaki is only the second woman to win Best Director.
Even better, she's one of three  women on our list this year...including
runner-up Chloé Zhao for The Rider!  (Debra Granik brought up the
rear.) Toss in Japanese director Kore-eda and Spike Lee and we're
looking at a list with only white dude on it -- Adam McKay. And he did
it with a take-down of other  white dudes, I might add. For one brief
shining moment, the IRAs is woke. But "woke" is an on-going process
not a state of being, so we'll have to do just as well in every category for
years to come to indicate real progress in the industry. Happily, the
films released in 2018 let us show we can celebrate diversity with the
best of 'em and for the best of reasons: they are the best.
BEST PICTURE
1. Capernaum  -- 22 pts.
2. (tie)  The Rider -- 17 pts.
    (tie)  Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse  -- 17 pts.
4. If Beale Street Could Talk  -- 14 pts.
5. Shoplifters -- 13 pts.
It's the grand finale and for the first time in history, the best film of the
year is directed by a woman. (The year Nancy Savoca won director for
Household Saints,  that movie was beaten out by Six Degrees Of
Separation  for Best Picture. Bad call.) The IRAs are pretty stalwart
auteurists, but it was a wild and wooly vote with some shockers at the
end. Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse didn't score a single point for
Best Director. That said more about the nature of this particular film,
since animated movies are a group effort like nothing since musicals in
the heyday of MGM. Spidey  almost made history as the first animated
film to win Best Picture, a long-overdue barrier that needs to fall. It was
tied for second, alongside the acclaimed indie effort The Rider . That
one didn't seem a contender for a while, but the points it did score were
in key categories like Cinematography, Screenplay and Actor while the
areas it didn't get points in (Production Design, Use Of Music) had
more to do with the type of film it was tha with the quality of work. Add
in Zhao's strong showing in Best Director and the five point gap
separating it from the winner suddenly seems quite small indeed. Beale
Street fell way back to fourth place, but hey, it's an honor just to be
nominated, right? Jenkins can take comfort in five IRAs and the
dominating sweep Moonlight enjoyed just two years ago when it won
four awards including Picture and Director. Kore-eda might have
suffered from having two movies in contention, but even if he had just
competed with one or the other, it's doubtful his support would have
doubled so he could snag a victory. In short, Capernaum  won and so
did the IRAs, with a woman standing on top clutching the IRA for Best
Film. For the first time but not, we venture to say, for the last.
SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep)
1. On The Basis of Sex -- 14 pts.
2. (tie)  Let The Sunshine In -- 10 pts.
    (tie)  Mary Poppins Returns -- 10 pts.
4. (tie)  Cold War -- 8 pts.
    (tie  A Wrinkle In Time -- 8 pts.
             
DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick)
. The Favourite  -- 25 pts.
2. Bohemian Rhapsody -- 19 pts.
3. Green Book --  17 pts.
4. Roma -- 9 pts.
5. BlacKKKlansman --  7 pts.
NOTE: The Favourite  was my favorite film of the year. Not only didn't
it win anything, it was the most mocked movie of the year to boot!
(Welcome to my world, says Andy.) Apparently, the fish eye lens is
unforgivable. Someone tell Stanley Kubrick, who won the first Best
Picture award for Barry Lyndon.  Fishy, indeed. Fun fact: all five films
here were nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
MECHANICAL ACTRESS
1. Tilda Swinton  for Suspiria  -- 20 pts.
2. Jennifer Lawrence for Red Sparr ow --  18 pts.
3. Meryl Streep  for Mary Poppins Returns  -- 17 pts.
4. Dakota Johnson  for Suspiria  -- 14 pts.
5. Glenn Close for  The W ife --  12 pts.
NOTE: Actors often win a top award only to be tagged with a Mechanical 
award once IRA  voters decide those artists are using the same tics and
mannerisms for role after role. They're an unfor giving lot, to say the least.
That delightful creature Swinton (cooler than all the IRAnians put together
times a thousand) won Best Actress for the 2010 ﬁlm I Am Love.  Deservingly
so. In contrast, the great Meryl Streep (who has indeed done a poor job in
recent years picking roles) has been snapping up Mechanicals since the 1980s.
She was singled out for 1986's Heartburn , 2007's Lions for Lambs  and the
ﬁlm Rendition , 2008's Doubt , 201 1's The Ir on Lady  and 2013's August: Osage
County . Streep has never won a proper IRA  but can take some comfort in 21
Oscar nominations and three wins, along with two BAFT As and three Emmys.
She's also an EGOT  in nominations.  
MECHANICAL ACTOR
1. Rami Malek and his dentures for  Bohemian Rhapsody  -- 18
pts.
2. Lin-Manuel Miranda for  Mary Poppins Returns  -- 13 pts.
3. (tie) Chadwick Boseman for Black Panther -- 8 pts.
    (tie) Steve Carell for  Beautiful Boy , Welcome T o Marwen  -- 8 pts.
    (tie) Cillian Murphy for  The Party  -- 8 pts.
    (tie) John Travolta for  Gotti  -- 8 pts.

WHO OR WHAT ARE THE IRAS? A HISTORY
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the
best films of the year since 1976. Officially known as the New York
Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs --
they are more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more
mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than
the Golden Globes. 
The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained
about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do
better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to
establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is
named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story
lost in the mist of time, alcohol and since it was the 1970s perhaps
cannabis.) The IRAs group has been profiled in  The New Yorker, so it
is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of
it. Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included
Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-selling
and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics,
screenwriters, budding playwrights, film scholars, plain old movie buffs
and so on. 
Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best movies of the
year. The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are
passionate film lovers. Many have careers involving the arts, but it's not
always easy to stay in the swim of things, to keep on top of the flood of
new releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA
members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a
time. The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in
theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) eventually on some
streaming service or DVD. Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay
committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their
college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life,
before jobs and family made frivolous claims on their time. So if you
want to stay on top of great cinema every year or explore its history,
there's no better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs. 
True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the
year than anyone else. But they've been doing it for decades so hey, it's
tradition!
