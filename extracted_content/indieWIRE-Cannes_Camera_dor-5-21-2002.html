CANNES 2002: Camera d'Or Likely To Reward 
Poverty And Despair, Not Animated Horses 
by Michael Giltz 
(indieWiREIOS .21.02) -AI the Cillnn" FUm Festival, the 
Camera d'Or is celebrating its 25th year by focusing on 25 
films thai it believes herald a new crop of distinctive talent. The 
firat winner back in 1976 was an American -Robert M. 
Young with the now forgotten "Alambriate ." Who knows? It 
could hapPen again. 
The two American candidates are Peter SolleU's debut "Long 
WillY Home" and DreamWolks ' "Spirit: Stallion of the 
Cimarron ." Spirit was roundly ignored by one and all as no 
Shrek (last yeats surprise triumph of the fest). Indeed, the 
press screening at the grand Lumiere was one of the least­
attended events so far. 
But Solieit's drama was a last minute delight. This New Yolk 
City-based stoty about a 17 year old would-be Romeo has 
marvelous performances from its young cast and especially 
the always despaifiog Mommy. an elderly Dominican 
grandmothef who can't handle the pressures of modem life 
when thai means one of her grandsons misses mass and the 
other one is masturbatin9 in the bathroom , (She eyes the 
boy's off-camera erection with a withering stare and then says. 
"Oh, the shame." He's going to need a lot of therapy.) It has 
the revelatory feel of George Washington . but with a much 
more audience-pleasing storyline. It's a natural for the New 
Yolk F~m Festival Of" at least New DirectorslNew Films and it's 
just been picked up by Samuel Goidwyn and Fireworks. 
The cineastes -who WOfry whenever a film is too entertaining 
-have thrown their support behind "J.apon" (Japan), a 
Mexico-Spain co-productioo directed by Cartos Reygadills . At 
129 minutes, it's one of the longer films at a festival notable for

its wonderfully brief films (many have clocked in at around 90 
minutes). Even so, it was reportedly cut by 17 minutes after 
previous festival screenings and thank goodness - "Japan" 
takes its own sweet time as it is. 
A corrmercial non-starter, "Japan" shows a limping, middle­
aged man descending to a remote village to off himself. He 
stays in the bam of a elderty peasant woman who senses his 
despair and reaches out in a simple way. 
Reygadas takes bold stylistic chances, p!"esenting some 
scenes with absolutely no sound and a whirling final shot that 
is dizzying and only partially successful. (He also risks the 
wrath of the ASPCA, since the shot of a pigeon's tom head 
that is still breathing is either a great special effect or. more 
likely, gives the lie to the claim that no animals were narmed 
during the making of the film.) 
He also shoots one of the most quietly awkward,least sexy 
sex scenes imaginable. "Japan" is "awed but ambitious and 
achieves enough 10 let cineastes feel Reygadas has more to 
offer. 11'15 the favorite of !hose few disturbed by "City of God"'s 
glossy sheen. 
More ambitious -at least structurally -and much leu 
successful is "Camag .. " (Camage), the first feature by the 
French short film auteur Delphln. G\ei:r. •. 
Her tale begins with a very sexy young bullfighter being gored 
by a half-blind beast. The parts of the bull travel all over 
Europe: the eyes 11'0 to a scientist who has been cheating on 
his pregnant wife (wait till he find out how many babies are in 
that enormous tummy of hers), the meat 10 a mother who is 
afraid her daughter win diSCOller a shameful secret, the bone 
to a family with a beloved dog, the homsto a taxid6fTTlist (who 
I believed was ~ving with his mother, whom another critic 
suggesled was his wife), the ears to the bullfighter f'Shling for 
his life. and so on. 
"CaRWIge " never reached emotional depth and once viewers 
figure out what all these different strands have in convnon 
lhefe's little more to be gained. 
"Madame Sala" prefers to take its chances on real 
melodrama . A Bra:r.ilian film, this one set in the '305, it tells the 
story of one oftha legends of Carnival. "Madame Sata" began 
as an uneducated street tough named Joao Francisco, 
brought vividly to life in a glowering , intense performa nce by 
Lazaro Ramos that is the film's strongestassel Poge2of4

Like a young Robert De Niro -if De Niro played a character 
who longed to sing sambas in girlish costumes after sleeping 
with his passionate male lovers -Ramos command s 
attention. Joao is highly volatile, even around friends tike the 
female prostitute whose son he looks after and the fey male 
prostitute he pulls &Cams with. 
If you know about the glamorous Madame Sala (who lived into 
her 70s), this movie doesn' really explain where she came 
from. If you know nothing about her and watch the film, the 
8witch from a doomed petty thief into a star is rather hard 
shocking. But Ramos' electJic presence forestalls any 
questions -you're simply too seared and thrilled by him 10 
ask. If there W8IlI acting awards for Camera d'Or, he'd be 
highly louted. 
So would Sevenne Caneale, who won Best Actress in '99 for 
her brilliant work In "L'Humanlte " (Humanity). Some griped 
that this temle woriter -an untrained amateur -didn't 
deserve to win over the professionals, a rather bizarre claim 
really. Even if it had been a nuke, Caneele's performance was 
compening . But she proves it was no accident wiItl·Une Part 
du Cle'" (A Piece of Sky). 
"A Piece of Sky" ties together the struggles of female 
prisoners pushing to be compensated for their labor (led by 
Caneele) wiItl female factory woricers also struggling for fair 
practices . Ifs rather too polemica l, even for the leftists thai 
dominate Cannes, but Caneele's worir. is exceptiona l, proving 
her decision to make a second film -despite the briclotbats she 
endured -was the right one. 
Another film getting a ho-hum response is "Sord de 
... ,. (Seaside) , a velY thin slice of life in a tiny resort lown 
where change comes at a snairs paoeSand so does the film. 
Less than nothing happens, though it would have been nice to 
figure out the purpose of the factory where workers sort small 
pebbles. 
Also feeling rather lonely is ·Oix ... pt fol. Cecile 
Cassard," (11 rImeS Cecile Cassard), in which a recently 
widowed woman manages 10 come alive again by watching 
gay men hustle for sex. Really. 
Slightly more believable is "Rana'. Wedding " which pai~ a 
high-concept plot -young woman has just a few hours to find 
a man and marry him! -with the harsh realities of life In Israel. 
Happily, the movie is fairly balanced, with empathy for the 
Jews as well as its Palestinaian protagonists , something that 
can't be said for the main competition entry "Oivln.

Intervention '-That won' be enough to make ~Rana's 
Wedding" lake the cake, ~ever ," Intacto" (Inlact) -which 
imagines luck 10 be as tradable a commodity as gold -was 
also respected by some, but has no champions .
