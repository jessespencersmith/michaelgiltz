Conversations on the Rising Threats to Democracy
by Noam Chomsky, David Barsamian
Price: $18.00 (Paperback)
Published: December 05, 2017
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: In a compelling new set of interviews, Noam Chomsky
identifies the "dry kindling" of discontent around the world that could sooncatch fire.  In wide-ranging interviews with David Barsamian, his longtime
interlocutor, Noam Chomsky asks us to consider âthe world we are leaving
to our grandchildren: one imperiled by the escalation of climate change
and the growing potential for nuclear war. If the current system isincapable of dealing with these threats, he argues, it's up to us toradically change it. These ten interviews, conducted from 2013 to 2016,
examine the latest developments around the globe: the devastation of
Syria, the reach of state surveillance, growing anger over economicinequality, the place of religion in American political culture, and thebitterly contested 2016 U.S. presidential election. In accompanyingpersonal reflections on his Philadelphia childhood and his eighty-seventh
birthday, Chomsky also describes his own intellectual journey and the
development of his uncompromising stance as America's premier dissidentintellectual.

What We Say
This book collects twelve wide-ranging interviews between journalist David Barsamian and linguist/philosopher/activist
Noam Chomsky. They took place as far back as 2013 and as recently as an email exchange in June of 2017 about the TrumpPresidency. As always, Chomsky is an absorbing counterpoint to the talking heads in politics and the media, which typically
range from moderate centrists to the far, far right. The left? The genuine left, the left that exists in Europe and Central
and South America and most of the free world? That is dismissed and ignored in the US. This is where Chomsky comes in.He is a voice of conscience though he's too funny and sharp and pointed to strike one in such a dull, moralistic manner. IShare This Book

<p>am not at the "end of capitalism" or "communitarian" stage (yet). But Chomsky will challenge your idea of what is possible,
what is inevitable and what must be done. Whether calling the US drone program the single greatest exporter of terror in
the world (and almost unquestionably a source of growing anti-American terror) or politely suggesting Senator Bernie
Sanders not term his political movement a "revolution" since it is at best a modest reform of the current system, Chomskynever fails to alter your perspective and question your base assumptions. Foreign policy, his childhood, the Republican Partyas debased and barely a party since it is so divorced from average voters -- Chomsky offers up thoughts on it all. You'llwant to read more and wish you could talk with him yourself. Someone who can be blocked one week by Israel and the next
by Palestinians is obviously someone worth listening to indeed. -- Michael Giltz
