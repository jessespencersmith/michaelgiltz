<p>THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING  ($34.99 Bluray; Warner Bros.) -- I still remember seeing the
trailer for this movie at a movie theater on Federal Highway in Pompano Beach, Florida, as a little kid.
Man, did this film look epic. I didn't get to see it in the theater but when it came to HBO I was glued andwatched it again and again. A mid-period peak for director John Huston, it features the dream team ofSean Connery and Michael Caine as soldiers of fortune. (The term "bromance" could have been created todescribe the great chemistry they show here.) The tale is based on a short story by Rudyard Kipling andfeatures these two men wandering into an undiscovered kingdom via the Hindu Kush. Thanks to rifles(compared to the spears of the locals) and a mistaken belief that they are gods, the two soon have the runof the place. But love for the most beautiful woman in the land and the godly flaw of hubris ruins theirparadise. It's a corker, a real "guy" movie, and I'm always surprised when people don't know it as well as,
say, The Magnificent Seven  or The Great Escape.  I haven't had a chance to sit down and truly enjoy it
again yet, but a spot-check shows a fine transfer.
TRUE BLOOD THIRD SEASON  ($59.99 regular or $79.99 BluRay; HBO) -- True Blood  may be giving
Glee  a run for its money in the most Greenwich Village friendly show on TV. But it also passed Mad Men
as the show with the most talked about plot twists and characters. Love it or hate it, you have to discuss
it. It's still not my cup of tea -- I prefer the more humorous spin of the novels by Charlaine Harris -- but Ido feel I have to watch to stay current. HBO always provides nice packaging, but they also have thepriciest sets in town. It's good the suggested retail price has come down quite a bit from the heyday ofThe Sopranos.
WHO TOOK THE BOMP? LE TIGRE ON TOUR  ($19.99; Oscilloscope) -- This road movie
documentary captures Le Tigre on their world tour after signing to Universal for their first and onlymajor label album. It's a bit raw and for fans only, but captures the spirit of the band well. The DVDfeatures solid extras, including a clutch of live performances not seen in the original 72 minute film,another concert from 2002, outtakes and more.

<p>THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES  ($34.99; Warner Bros.) -- This early directorial effort by Clint
Eastwood gets a bit lost in the shuffle when assessing his career. As a western, it leans more towards his
iconic spaghetti westerns, albeit more serious. As a directorial effort, it doesn't feel like the fresh startthat Play Misty For Me  and such later fare as Bird  would be. The post-Civil War saga is a complex affair
but what sticks in the mind is the revenge Clint takes against the evil Union soldiers who slaughtered hisfamily. Maybe it doesn't quite glorify violence, but he sure looks cool taking them down. I would venturethat Clint went on to make Unforgiven  to spell out clearly, once and for all the toll violence takes, even
when you're in the right. If you saw only this and Dirty Harry,  you might be right to think revenge is
about the most badass game in town. This BluRay edition looks smashing, by the way.
AMERICAN: THE BILL HICKS STORY  ($28.99 regular and $29.99 BluRay; BBC/2 Entertain) -- As
Jesus said, no prophet is accepted in his hometown. Stand-up legend Bill Hicks proved that again. He'san iconic figure to other comics little known to most Americans. Hicks had to go overseas to find acertain fame for his groundbreaking work. That's why this film comes via the BBC label. Just as he wasbreaking through, Hicks discovered he had terminal cancer in 1993. This inventive look at his careercombines interviews, performances, and animation, not to mention hours and hours of extras. Start withone of his classic routines and then come here to find out who the heck this guy is and why you haven'theard of him before.

<p>AMERICAN GRAFFITI  ($19.98 regular or $26.98 BluRay; Universal)
THE STUNT MAN  ($29.98; Severin) 
NIGHT FLIGHT  ($19.98; Warner Bros.)
APT PUPIL  ($17.97; Image) -- A clutch of reissues worth checking out. I've somehow been immune to
the charms of American Graffiti , but I love the movie for two reasons. One, it made classic 50s rock and
roll cool again. Two it helped director George Lucas get the clout to make Star Wars. The Stunt Man  is a
genuine cult movie in a world where "cult movie" is thrown around far too often and a sly spin on
moviemaking beloved by people in the industry. It has a great performance by Peter O'Toole. NightFlight  is a little rickety but this is the very first time on DVD for this curio based on the novel Night
Flight  by Antoine de Saint-Exupery (yes, the author of The Little Prince ). If you want to read a great
novel about aviation, get that book immediately. FInally, Apt Pupil  is a very good adaptation of a
Stephen King short story from Different Seasons,  the peak of his short fiction career, thanks to tales that
led to The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me  and this. Maybe someday someone will tackle "The
Breathing Method," the fourth novella in this collection, but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.

extensive interviews with baseball legends on DVD sets about two hours in length each and grouped byteam. Nothing fancy and no clips, just intelligent, thoughtful conversation. When It Was A Game  collects

is more than two hours long (that is a LOT of flubbed balls) and Heroics  contains all 9 episodes of the
argument-starting series debating the "greatest home runs," "comebacks" and the like. Finally, with Mark
Teixeira and Curtis Granderson of the New York Yankees on pace to make a run for the iconic 61
"record" (and without the cheating that has spoiled the memory of the fake achievements by the forever-
shamed Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa), it's a great time to check out the HBO movie 61*,  the film Billy
Crystal will surely want on his tombstone.
