<p>TRACY & HEPBURN: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION  ($59.98; Warner Bros.) -- So what's your
pick for the greatest screen team of them all? William Powell and Myrna Loy? (I do love The Thin Man .)
Bob Hope and Bing Crosby with their nutty Road  movies? Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor? Laurel
and Hardy? Focus on actors who made at least a few movies together. Think all you like about it -- my
money is on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. This boxed set makes the case. They made nine filmstogether: two are pretty dull ( Sea of Grass  and Keeper Of The Flame ) and one is well-intentioned and
very dull ( Guess Who's Coming To Dinner ). That leaves six films that are good to great. Among the good
are Desk Set  and Pat & Mike  and Without Love.  The greats? Woman Of The Year. State Of The Union.
Adam's Rib.  That would be enough for any career but those are just the movies they made together. Tracy
is simply the greatest screen actor of them all; his naturalness on camera is a wonder to behold. Listen to
him deliver a speech in Union  about the greatness of this country and see how he makes it sound so
convincing and true, an idea that just popped into his head. (Please, someone get Obama to watch this
film. It could have been written yesterday.) And no one ever listened better to their co-stars, fed themmore energy and support. Hepburn ain't so bad herself. And together they have that chemistry that somany movies strive for but rarely reach. The way her eyes shine when looking at him in Dinner . The way
they fight in Adam's Rib , in only the way people in love can truly fight. Their dynamic is still my image of
what a relationship should be: two equals, holding on to their own identities and ideals just as strongly asthey fight for and love the other. The capper is Hepburn's TV tribute to Tracy after he died. If you don'ttear up when she reads the letter she wrote to her late love, then I don't want to know you. Now tell meyour pick for the best team of them all. Or if you prefer, the runners-up to Tracy & Hepburn.

<p>LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD COMPLETE COLLECTIO N ($179.98; BBC)
DR. QUINN MEDICINE WOMAN SEASON ONE  ($29.95; A&E)
HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN SEASON ONE  ($29.95; A&E)
Family programming is very hard to make well, avidly looked for by audiences who don't always want
edgy material when they're sitting down together with their kids to see some drama and often treated
with disdain by networks even when the shows are hits. Brenda Hampton created 7th Heaven , one of the
biggest drama hits of all time and yet all the networks spurned her ideas for new shows and Hamptonfound a new home on ABC Family. Lark Rise  was -- I emphasize was -- one of the biggest hits of them all
in the UK. And yet new programming heads decided they had too many period dramas and cancelled itoutright in the midst of its fourth season. Fans can catch up with this solid, very well-acted show about ayoung woman who leaves her small village to work in the bustling town of Cranford, which itself is prettysmall, so it all feels rather Little House-ish with a British accent. Dr. Quinn  and Highway To Heaven  are
also out again in single season sets at $30 each. How did I miss Joseph Gordon-Levitt popping up in
season one of Quinn ? Enjoy them; major TV networks are too busy trying to find the next bloody and
violent Sopranos  to waste their time with TV families always want to watch.
CASINO JACK  ($29.98 BluRay or $22.98 regular DVD; FOX) -- Kevin Spacey stars in this broad, loopy
look at Jack Abramoff, the disgraced lobbyist who was once the toast of K Street and had direct access to
the White House. We start with Spacey in prison, so we know Abramoff is headed for a fall. But whileSpacey has snap in the role, it's not that interesting to see him and his partner get ballsier and morecrude in their influence peddling. I wish there were more sting, either in Abramoff's self-awareness of hiscrimes or our awareness of how much we might enjoy similar power. But they're basically jerks with noreal talent for anything but bullying and coercion, so what's the fun in that? Jon Lovitz however steals
away with another movie, thanks to his droll and very funny turn as a mattress king looking to get into
casinos. A movie about him? Now that would be worth gambling on.

<p>TAXI DRIVER ON BLURA Y ($24.95; Sony) -- James Cameron and Peter Jackson have made a lot of
noise about shooting movies at a higher speed (48 or 60 frames per second instead of the usual 24 fps).
That might eliminate the headaches some feel when watching 3-D and definitely provides a startling
increase in image quality that Jackson compared to the difference between an LP and a compact disc. Did
you know that BluRays can display movies at 60 fps? You need a high quality TV to get the benefits of
course, but I must say that watching Taxi Driver on BluRay has blown me away. It feels like a completely
different experience, radically changed from how I saw it on what always seemed like muddy prints in
the past. It's different emotionally and visually in subtle and obvious ways. Is this what Martin Scorsesewas looking at on his editing deck and what he wanted us to see, the way so many classic albums soundcloser to the original masters on CD than an audio cassette ever could? This comes loaded with bonusfeatures but the real bonus is to watch a movie that may be overly familiar to you and have it seem sofresh and new.
HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1  ($35.99 BluRay combo pack; Warner
Bros.) -- Yes, this movie felt like one long prelude to the whiz bang action we're going to see in the finale.(I for one can't wait to see Maggie Smith leading a charge of desks.) The Potter DVDs have always beenstuffed with extras and then restuffed on more elaborate sets down the road. Surely there will be onemassive boxed set when all is said and done so you know whether to dive in or wait. I will say this setoffers a BluRay, a DVD and a digital copy. I's on sale for about $23, which is pretty darn good. You canget just a DVD or BluRay for $14 or $17 respectively, so they're all quite good deals and it's nice to seeBluRay slowly lowering its prices to meet regular DVDs. They shouldn't be a premium, just a nice bonus
for those who keep buying DVDs and want the best quality.

<p>WHITE MATERIA L 
LE CIRCLE ROUGE  ($39.95 each on BluRay; Criterion) -- Criterion presents with care the latest film
from director Claire Denis. It shows a white woman in an African country who refuses to abandon the
family farm even as rebels overtake the government and threaten to wipe out competing tribes and ofcourse colonial whites (even ones born and raised there). One reads about such people and thinks, "Whywould they stay?" This film does a good job of getting under the skin of one such woman, played byIsabelle Huppert. It goes off the rails at the end, but it's intelligently made, boasts a great score byTindersticks and comes with the solid extras pne expects. Jean-Pierre Melville made so many great crime
films -- Rififi, Le Samorai, Bob Le Flambeur, Le Doulos -- it's hard to know where to begin. Why not with
Le Circle Rouge, featuring Alain Delon as an ex-con who pulls off an easy heist only to discover that it'sjust as hard to avoid mistakes after the crime as it is during it. one great bonus includes 30 minutes ofon-set footage that gives you a peek at them while they work.
ANYTHING GOES  ($29.98; E One) -- If you can't make it to Broadway for the new blockbuster revival
of Cole Porter's Anything Goes, check out this condensed version made for TV. It was performed live andfeatures Ethel Merman in the role she indelibly stamped forever, along with a game Frank Sinatra andBert Lahr. It's great fun to see them romping their way through the show and then taking bows in front</p>
<p>of a live audience. Catnip for theater buffs.
COUNTRY STRONG  ($34.95 BluRay or $28.95 regular; Screen Gems; Sony) -- This is a curious little
movie. It hits every cliche about a washed-up country singer (Gwyneth Paltrow) hoping for a comeback
and watching younger and perkier women hot on her trail (Leighton Meester). And it ends terribly. Butscene to scene it's actually kind of good, even though the script bungles by avoiding obvious steps like
having Paltrow perform the song she writes with Garrett Hedlund at the very beginning when about to
leave rehab. In fact, Paltrow's big moment in the spotlight is presented incompetently by writer-director
Shana Feste, who never lets Paltrow deliver one big number for an emotional release but cuts and cuts
from a piece of one song to another. Tim McGraw is fine as Paltrow's pushy husband. But the realdelights were Hedlund and Meester, who have great chemistry together and sing well and even get thebest musical moment: a duet called "Give In To Me," which bizarrely is only included on the secondsoundtrack and not the first.
BABE  ($26.98; Universal) -- Babe  is one of the greats, and just in the category of family films. It makes
my short list for one of the best 100 movies of all time. It comes from writer-producer George Miller, whohas unquestionably been creating one of the most unique bodies of work in film history. My onlycomplaint is that the darker, weirder sequel Babe: Pig In The City isn't also on this disc as the perfectdouble bill. If you've never seen the original, you're in for a treat. But be forewarned: for a week or twoafterwards, your kids may insist on being vegetarians.</p>
<p>H.R. PUFNSTUF: THE COMPLETE SERIES  ($34.97; Vivendi) -- I can't pretend this trippy little
series by Sid & Marty Krofft is actually good; I can't claim it has a subversive crazy appeal and adults will
discover an unexpected treat. No, it's just very strange and makes you wonder how it ever got on the air.But it does have a perverse pull for someone like me who saw the show when it originally aired. And Godknows you can have a good laugh (not at it, with it -- everyone involved clearly knew this was campynonsense) watching an episode or two. But the novelty soon fades. I am, however, inordinately pleasedby the collectible bobblehead of Mr. Pufnstuf himself.
FIDDLER ON THE ROOF 40TH ANNIVERSARY  ($29.99 BluRay and DVD combo; MGM) -- Like
My Fair Lady, this film has always seemed a rather turgid capturing of a landmark Broadway musical.Still, it's good to have Topol's Oscar-nominated performance captured forever and the movie certainlylooks smashing. The extras are voluminous.
THE INCREDIBLES  ($45.99 BluRay combo pack; Disney) -- After the Toy Story  trilogy, this might be
the ideal introduction to what makes Pixar so great. It's a tremendous action film, a great superheromovie, a warm family drama and filled with humor. The attention to detail is marvelous with charactersgetting just as much focus as the set-pieces that will blow you away. The combo is a little pricey and they</p>

Woody Allen & Diane Keaton. "Play It Again, Sam," "Sleeper," 'Love & Death, " "Annie Hall,"
"Manhattan ." Those 5 right there are both absolutely hilarious AND romantic. Then, just to show
how wonderful the chemisty was almost 15 years later, "Manhattan Murder Mystery," one of Allen's
most underrated .
Being a big fan of director Jack Hill, the first pair to come to mind is Pam Grier and Sid Haig. Notnecessaril y portrayed as a romantic couple, sometimes deadly adversarie s, always great on-screen
chemistry together. They starred in at least three seminal 70's exploitati on classics together. All
have great trailers on YouTube, though not linked due to being more or less "NSFW" - The Big DollHouse, Coffy, and The Big Birdcage.
Coffy is great fun. Clearly you're smarter about this genre than me.
The greatest movie team of all time? John Wayne and his Ego.
Gotta go with William Powell and Myrna Loy. Even though they played the same characters in most
of their pairings, they were perfect. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara were great too. Non romanticRecency  |  Popularity

pairings; Abbot and Costello; Laurel and Hardy of course. But Walter Brennan and Gary Cooper
made quite a few movies together. I can think of four right off the bat: "Meet John Doe," "Pride ofthe Yankees;" "Sgt. York" and "The Westerner. " All good. I'm sure there were others. Cary Grant
and Irene Dunne made 3 good films together as well. "My Favorite Wife" is my favorite. The reactionscene in the elevator when Cary firsts sees Irene is iconic. And Irene pretending to be Cary's sisterin "The Awful Truth" and singing that song? it doesn't get any better.
Grant and Dunne.
I didn't know Grant Tinker had ever worked with Dominick Dunne!
Actually I meant Grant Goodeve and Griffin Dunne. (Two can play) :-) Cary Grant
and Irene Dunne, of course.
One can make a case for hepburn and tracy but i would add that cooper and kate made thegreatest rom. com. of alltime in bringing up baby!
"Cooper and Kate"? And in BRINGING UP BABY? Every time I've seen BRINGING UPBABY it starred Kate Hepburn and Cary Grant. There isn't anyone named Cooper in it, noteven uncredited . If you mean Gary Cooper, he's not in BRINGING UP BABY. In fact, so far
as I can find out, Gary Cooper and Kate Hepburn never worked together in anything, so I'mafraid they don't qualify as much of a screen team.
Darn, I WISH I adored Tracy and Hepburn together on screen; it could provide hours of goodviewing. I am the rare fish that never got it; not at a true core level. I preferred Hepburn on theone(I think only one) film with Bogart, African Queen. How many movies did Bacall and Bogartmake? Was it the Big Sleep (I am obviously not well versed in this area. I just like what I like).I'd say Taylor/Bur ton moved me more (exception being Cleo).
I remember laughing, at about at 14ish at a series of British comedies called "Carry On (thenwhatever the theme like Carry on Nurse. Does anyone else remember those? Are they are DVD?
Thanks an forgive my ignorance.

425 FansThe Carry On movies were great low-brow fun. There are, I think, about 26 of them. The
first 12 are on DVD in a great boxed set I happen to have. The others have not been
released on American DVD, unfortunat ely, though they are out on English PAL DVDs.
I absolutely adore their 2 best films - Adam's Rib and Desk Set. Their byplay in the latter is alsoclassic - an indescriba ble chemistry that cannot be faked - or even acted - but comes from genuine
love for each other.
Good God! How can 'Catherine Hepburn'-i n the one sub-head-g et by your proofreade rs...espec ially
when her first name is spelled correctly less than one and a half inches away? Homonyms are one
thing when the spelling is similar, but 'Katharine ' is not remotely like 'Catherine '...at least not to
anyone with reading skills beyond the third grade level.
Thanks for pointing that out. I didn't do the tags and might never have noticed if you hadn'tmentioned. There are no proofreade rs of the actual articles, however. They just go up the
way I wrtie them so any mistakes in the article itself are all mine.
Look, I love Tracy and Hepburn as much as the next movie fan, but The Greatest Screen Team wascalled The Marx Brothers. Laurel & Hardy a close second, and after that, I tend towards Karloff &Lugosi, and Peter Cushing & Christophe r Lee. (who made 22 movies together, making Tracy &
Hepburn mere pikers by comparison .) Give me a good monster movie over a rom-com any day.
Glad to see I'm not the only person to find the movie of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF "rather turgid."
I must admit I was thinking of movie duos. But The Marx Brothers are one of a kind indeed.I would feel more strongly about Laurel & Hardy if I had more chances to watch their shorts(which I understand contain by far their best work) but for some reason they're not readilyavailable in the US. If you prefer monster movies, then I guess one of your dream teamswould be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in Whatever Happened To Baby Jane, right?HUFFPOST BLOGGER

425 FansWell many of their shorts are available, if not always in very good condition. I grew
up seeng the shorts on TV all the time, and know many of them very well indeed.Some are pretty weak, but the good ones vastly outnumber the weak ones, and a
good-sized number of them are BRILLIANT. I felt like I was walking on Holy
Ground when I walked up the Vendome Steps in Silverlake up and down which
Laurel & Hardy carried that ill-fated piano in their Oscar-winn ing short THE MUSIC
BOX. Just a month or two ago, TCM had a marathion of their shorts. Why weren'tyou watching them? Stan Laurel was a genius. (Stan was the major creative forcein the team.) AVOID their 20th Century Fox films, as Stan asked us to, because
they had no creative input at all, and they all suck!
Much as I enjoy BABY JANE, two women who so loathed each other that the
hatred onscreen was but a pale reflection of the hatred on the set, is not my ideaof a "team." A team works TOGETHER to do something. Bette and Joan were
busy thinking up ways to sabotage each other. Joan wearing diving belt weights
under her dress for the scene where Bette has to drag her out of bed, downstairs ,
and to the car, nearly doubling her weight, is funny as hell, but it's the opposite of
teamwork.

'rather turgid'??
How about 'boring and sleep-indu cing beyond belief'? :D
That's another way of putting it. I'd be harsher but I've never actually made it all
the way through.
I don't particular ly like the film of "Fiddler" either, despite my friend Barry Dennen
playing the rabbis's son, and one of the reasons is Topol, who gives me the same
feeling that I have when I watch Simon Callow--th at there's an invisible twin of him
a few feet away giving himself a standing ovation. And when did a Russianpeasant ever sound like he'd done a season or two with the Oxford University
Dramatic Society? (P.S. He didn't win the Oscar in 1972--Gene Hackman won that
year.)
