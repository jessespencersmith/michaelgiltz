So here it is in all its glory.Match Point ***DreamWorks; $29.99Once you get over the shock of seeing Woody Allen’s first honest-to-goodness it-doesn’t-suck movie since 1994’s “Bullets OverBroadway,” repeated viewings show this companion piece to “Crimesand Misdemeanors” is a solid, but not spectacular drama with two verysexy central performances from Jonathan Rhys Myers and ScarlettJohansson.
