            <p>T H U R S D AY,  J U LY  1 6 ,  2 0 0 9Best Movies Of The Year -- The Master ListAfter much prodding from Pete, who felt I SHOULD have a list of myfavorite movies from every year and if I did have a list I could put it onNetflix, here is my rundown of the best movies of the year. For everyyear. For people who always ask "What are your favorite movies,"here's the answer. Yes, I know you can argue about which year certainmovies belong to (especially films from other countries), but the pointis not to make an historical record but just to list some great moviesyou might want to check out. I start with my top pick from each year asa sort of uber list. No, it's not "the most important movies" period, justthe movie that meant the most to me from each year. Some years thechoice was easy, other times a few battled it out or I didn't feel stronglyenough about one particular film to make a statement. But you coulddo worse as a film buff than making sure you see all of them.BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME (MY #1 PICK FROM EACHYEAR 1924 -- PRESENT)The Class (2008)The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford (2007)Pan's Labyrinth (2006)The Best Of Youth (2005)The Incredibles (2004)To Be and To Have (2003)Y Tu Mamá También (2002)In the Mood for Love (2001)Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)Topsy-Turvy (1999)Rushmore (1998)L.A.
