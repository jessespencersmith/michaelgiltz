6/12/2005 12:13:00 AMIn their recent joint press conference, Bush and Blair gaverehearsed answers to not-so-probing questions about theDowning Street Memo. (The Memo made clear that top officialsin the Blair government knew Bush wanted to invade Iraq andwas going to fix the evidence any way he had to in order tojustify it.)Rather bizarrely, both Bush and Blair made the same weakresponse: oh, no, the memo can't be right because we wnet tothe UN AFTER it was written. Well, duh, you can hardly plansomething in advance and then cynically go through themotions without, you know, planning something in advance.Going to the UN didn't uncercut the memo; in fact, it supportedthe truth of the memo, because as we now know the US wentthere with evidence that was flimsy at best (the British papertrail to back up a claim Hussein was buying nuclear materialand the tubes that Colin Powell insisted were good for onething only -- helping to build a bomb). In fact,the British papertrail was forged and 99.9% of the experts in the US and aroundthe world who checked out the tubes before the US went publicsaid they were absolutely NOT for that purpose.So what gives? Why say that going to the UN proved theDowning Street Memo was wrong? Because repeating a lie overand over again is all you can do sometimes and pretty darneffective. And what were their other options?Here's MORE PROOF Bush was lying: the Times of London hasobtained more details showing that in 2002 Bush was going toinvade Iraq and that ministers needed to come up withsomething, anything, to provide legal backing. Their plan? Why,go to the UN and get an ultimatum and hope Husseinunilaterally defied it.It's taken the MSM six weeks to pay attention to the DowningStreet Memo. (In fact, according to Salon, during the next 19daily briefings after that memo came to light, only 2 out ofnearly 1000 questions were about it.) It better not make thatsame mistake again.
