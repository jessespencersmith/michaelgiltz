Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayWhat a clever fox Mary-Louise Parker proves to be. She gets the best of both worlds by a single stroke of genius:this memoir-ish novel (or novelistic memoir) is structured as a series of letters from Parker to the men in her life.They range from a poetic salvo that opens the book addressing them one and all to a moving finale of the imaginaryoyster man she imagines gathering the oysters that made up one of the last good moments for her dying father.Parker delivers a short story for all intents and purposes with a letter addressed to the dogs in her life -- not theanimals but the boyfriends who behaved like dogs, here transformed into actual dogs in a head-spinning allegory thatis funny and caustic and utterly unanswerable. (What guy can complain about it, since if they see themselves in itthey are damning their own doggy ways?) Truth and better-than-truth (i.e. fiction) merge here, with Parker's adoptionof a child in Africa to imagining herself talking to that oyster man in a cinematic scene where they are watched from adistance, the actual words she says lost in the noise of the surf. Parker nails details of acting school with deadpanhilarity, skewers herself happily, celebrates her children and so much more. You won't find any dissection of hermany theatrical triumphs or dishing of backstage dirt. Rather marvelously, "Dear Mr. You" is both disarmingly intimate(I feel like I know her) and a bravura performance. And isn't that what great acting (and great writing) are oftenabout? This is her first book but surely not her last. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Mary-Louise Parker’s Dear Mr. You is straight-up fantastic; a gripping and deeply humane and often hilarious book.It catches glimpses of life at all sorts of unexpected moments, electrifying them with its sharp-eyed astonishment athow absurd and joyous things can get. There’s nothing cheaply-earned about its wonder; nothing sugarcoated in itsgratitude.It’s all grit, all messy particulars—full of surprise and full-throated in its song.” - Leslie Jamison, author ofThe Empathy Exams“To have an artist accomplished in one genre triumph in another—seemingly out of the blue—is an extraordinaryevent. Mary-Louise Parker’s Dear Mr. You is a pants-pissingly funny, gut-wrenching meditation on her loving andtormented encounters with the masculine. From grandfather to father to son to the wacky, pre-Burning Man hippiewith a loincloth who haunts her at a co-op job to the lover who deserves the coda ‘Sleep tight, little monster.’ Whetherhonoring the ash-covered firefighter she sees on 9/11 or shouting as a crazy person at her malignantly lost cabdriver,Parker merges memoir with poetry in this haunting, sui generis work.
