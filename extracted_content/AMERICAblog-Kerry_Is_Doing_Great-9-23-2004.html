9/23/2004 01:09:00 AMForgive me if others have already weighed in. But I just watched mytape of John Kerry on David Letterman and he was terrific! I wish hecould appear on the show every day until the election. He wasappropriately relaxed but very Presidential and very serious at times.Letterman asked some very substantive questions and Kerry wasclear and forceful. He even read a Top Ten list about Bush's taxproposals (my favorite was the one that said Cheney could write offBush as a dependent) and then proved he'd actually watchedLetterman by tossing the postcard over his shoulder through the setbehind, as Letterman always does. That combined with his strongspeech on Iraq and focused, serious demeanor make me feel themost confident I've felt since the Republican convention.
