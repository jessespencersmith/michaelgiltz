            <p>F R I D AY,  D E C E M B E R  2 9 ,  2 0 0 6Bad News For Broadway: Record Box OfficeWhy is a record box office bad news for Broadway? Because it came at aterrible price. Broadway's box office is hitting $900 million in 2006.But attendance is down. How'd they do that? Rising ticket prices ofcourse. $110 was just an idea one year ago. Now it's the standard topprice. And that Variety story I linked to only hints at the worst trend:premium ticket prices. $110 isn't the top price on Broadway. Not evenclose. If you want GOOD seats, you're going to pay $150, $200, $250 oreven $300 for a Friday or Saturday night show. This isn't via a ticketbroker or scalper. This is at the box office, where anyone who wants topay a mere $110 for their seat better be buying a ticket eight months inadvance. In fact, I spent much of this year trying to buy tickets forfriends at least six months in advance and could find NOTHING forshow after show. If I wanted to pay $250, I could have bought a ticketfor that weekend though. This is a poisonous, terrible trend. Peopleready to pay what they think is the top price -- a very expensive $110 --will find out again and again that tickets for good seats at the top showssimply aren't available unless you're planning a year in advance.Broadway is making it IMPOSSIBLE for people to go to the theaterregularly, the way they do in London. And what kid is going to discoverBroadway at those prices? People have been decrying the end ofBroadway for many years of course. Broadway isn't going anywhere.Neither is opera. But when was the last time a regular Joe went to theopera? That's exactly what is happening to Broadway. It's becoming thesole province of the super-rich and insiders. Only tourists going to thesame four or five mega-shows ("Wicked," "The Lion King," "The ColorPurple") keep them running. New Yorkers going to the theater for funthe way others go to a movie? Good luck.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
