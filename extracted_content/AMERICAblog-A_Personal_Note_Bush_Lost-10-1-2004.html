10/01/2004 02:21:00 PMMy father is slightly to the right of Pat Buchanan politically. He thinksSingapore is a good way to run a country -- let the little people voteon dog catcher but all the big decisions are made by a strong man inpower. He gets all his information from Fox News and right wing talkradio and the New York Times is filled with lies, etc., etc. You get thepicture -- if Fox News said 1 plus 1 is 3, then you're a dirty commiefor suggesting it might be 2, in my dad's view. I have never heardhim say one negative thing about Bush.For kicks, I called him up and teasingly asked, "What did Fox Newstell you to think about the debate?" He paused and said, "I wasdisappointed." Huh? In the debate in general or Bush?"Bush just slouched too much. Kerry won the debate on looks. Hetold 21 lies [I let that slide] but Bush didn't...he was alright at first.But he kept attacking Kerry -- flip flop, flip flop -- and he didn't sayanything. He just kept repeating the same things."And he kept stopping before time ran out! I couldn't believe it. Youcan rest your arm on the podium and look folksy at a rally, but this isa debate -- even though it's not a real debate -- and stand upstraight! Look presidential! He just didn't seem to have anything tosay. He should have said, here's the situation in Iraq and here's myplan. But he just kept attacking Kerry and saying 'hard work' and'misleading.'"You could have knocked me over with a feather. Did my father changehis mind? Of course not. Will he still vote? Probably. But Kerry just lita fire under his base and Bush deflated his. That means fewer peoplerarin' to get to the polls and drag their friends with them.But don't forget your talking points: Bush is going to do a LOT betterat the next debate and learn from his awful performance here andKerry will be doing well to just hold his own against the Presidentbecause Bush has never lost a debate so he couldn't possibly lose twoin a row. Blah blah blah.Got any stories of far right family members and friends beingdisappointed and disillusioned? We'd love to hear them.
