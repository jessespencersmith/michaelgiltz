8/23/2005 06:48:00 PMThe long, LONG overdue fight over the junk food available inschool cafeterias is heating up, as USA Today shows. The junkfood industry of course tries to fob off new "policies" asimprovements to keep real change from happening. Onechange they suggested: offering "sports drinks" (which areloaded down with high fructose corn syrup just like soda) as anoption. But kids sitting on their ass in class don't need "sportsdrinks," as one critic pointed out. Healthy, tasty lunch menus --no, that doesn't include greasy fries and pizza -- can easily beprovided once schools break the chain of those awful foodservice providers and the bribes from Coke and Pepsi to stocktheir wares. Schools should ban ALL drinks with high fructosecorn syrup, offer 100% juice and water, fresh fruit andvegetables, well-balanced meals and re-institute gym class. Orkids will continue to get fatter and fatter and fatter.
