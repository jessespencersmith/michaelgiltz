Ta e t Ights! Canlera! Actor! As an actor, Joe Mantello has never been more visible, 
winning a Tony nomination for his role as the argumen足
tative louis in Angels in America_ But it's Mantello the 
director who's center stage now. He's directing Faith Prince on 
Broadway in What's Wrong With This Picture? And when Jerry 
Zaks stepped away from Love! Valour! Compassion!-the new 
Terrence McNally play at the Manhattan Theatre Club--Mantel-
10 took on that as well ... despite one week during which he was 
rehearsing both plays. Though L!V!C! was written by McNally 
and Mantello uHimately landed talent like Nathan lane, John 
Glover, and Stephen Spinella, casting was tough_ "H's very 
hard," says Mantello, "to cast plays right now; particularly 
when you try to cast men in their late thirties and forties. The 
casting director would hand us a list of people's names that 
would say 'not interested,' 'not available,' 'doesn't want to play 
gay.' H really is like 
calling in favors to get 
people." Early on, Man足
tello also had reserva足
tions about the 
audience at the MTC. 
"They were described 
to me as 'withholding,' 
as a group that refused 
to give Julie Andrews 
entrance applause. 
(But) the response has 
been great; I'm shocked Malltello alld the "L.'V!C'" cast. 
at how well it's going over." Broadway, of course, provides 
other shock waves. un I actually stopped to think how much 
money was being sunk into [What's Wrongj, I would be unable 
to go to work," Mantello admits. "So I'll just blindly continue on 
and pretend I'm doing a little showcase on 47th Street."
