 New York Times : Cutting Staff But
Making Movies
Read More:  Actors , David Pogue , Funny Videos , Iphone ,
Media , New York Times, Short Films , Sundance , Weapons , Youtube , Media News
Recently, I was mildly taken aback by New York
Times  tech reporter David Pogue creating a
music video for the new iPhone.  Always known
for his humorous and reader-friendly approach totech, Pogue was simply taking the next logicalstep. Ask someone to create videos for yourwebsite and this is what they'll do. But it seemedto cross a line to me, somehow. Not the end ofthe world, of course, but why exactly is the NewYork Times  spending precious resources (time
and money and talent) on entertainment, onshorts practically designed to get lots of hits on
YouTube? It wasn't the clever music video itself that bothered me so much as where I saw itheading.
And this is where it's arrived:  the New York Times  is hosting a series of 12 short films featuring
young actors improvising to scenarios by director Brody Baker. It was all done at Sundance,
apparently, and every few days the New York Times  features a new short in which actors like Josh
Lucas, Jason Ritter and Saffron Burrows emote in and around hotel rooms.
I don't care how good or bad the shorts are -- they could be Oscar worthy gems or an indulgent
waste of time. I don't care if the New York Times  didn't actually "spend" any money on the filming
and casting. I don't care if this is only marginally different from getting young actors to pose inclothes for a fashion spread. (Besides, it still feels like getting in bed with actors you're supposed tobe reporting on objectively.)
All I care about is that this is NOT how the New York Times  should be spending its finite time and
energy. The New York Times  should not be making music videos. The New York Times  should not
be making short films. The New York Times  should not be wasting valuable real estate on its
website promoting them. The New York Times  should not be hiring reporters/talent who look good
on camera and are known for funny videos so they can branch out into YouTube. But you know

I'm pretty sure the New York Times  has its hands full covering the news. And writing terrific, in-
depth articles like this,  articles that few news outlets can afford to spend the time and energy
reporting. Sure, the story of a 22 year old guy buying piles of aging, decaying ammunition from
Eastern Europe and flipping it to sell to Afghani fighters is so blackly humorous that it's probablyalready been optioned for the movies. I just don't want to see the film be funded by the Times  and
debut on their website.
So are these shorts a complete waste because the New York Times  should focus on its core
mission? Or am I just an old fuddy duddy?

Fuddy Duddy or not, you represent a declining readership; print media's inexorable ebb will continue,
unabated, until it recognises that the values to which you allude above -- namely, noble sums of time,energy and costs associated with producing in-depth Journalism -- are not necessarily the same values
young people are interested in protecting.
A 2007 Pew Research poll found as many adults, who regularly got their news from The Daily Show,
demonstrated a "high knowledge" of current events as those who did so from print news outlets (54%).The NYT is the gatekeeper no more, reflected in a declining subscriber base and disappearing offline
advertising revenue. So who is the NYT writing for? And is this the same audience it needs to survive?
You evidently value NTY's investigative, thorough approach; that's fine. But Alexa.com reports
Digg.com has a greater reach than NewYorkTimes.com, suggesting the market does not agree with
you. It marks the rise of the Citizen Journalist, a trend pros like Jeff Jarvis celebrate.
For better or worse, the NYT is not a philosophical experiment; I'm not an employee of the Times, but if I
were, I would be shouting to all who would listen: Our domain is the world, online and off; let our valuesof Truth and Public Service imbue our work in whatever form it may take, from op-eds to music videosto islands on virtual worlds.

Now I understand why our country is so messed up. Jon Stewart is a comedien, not aninvestigative reporter.
Maybe the problem is Americans are so lazy that they want their news told to them by
comediens while they watch TV instead of actually reading books or buying a newspaper andactually reading it.

Daily Show, just like wikipedia shouldn't be your main source but that how people are. stuckbecause for some reason.
editrix66 See Profile  I'm a Fan of editrix66  permalink
I love the Daily Show and watch it regularly, but I would never think it a substitute for in-depthinvestigative journlism, and I doubt Jon Stewart would, either. Identification of events andnewsmakers in a poll certainly cannot discern the level of depth of knowledge of thoseevents. Many on this site have bemoaned the lack of depth and horrible quality of televisionjournalism, and I can certainly understand the fear that newspaper journalism will follow suit.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I agree with editrx66 -- and Jon Stewart. Those polls or surveys are poorly wordedor misguided. You don't really enjoy The Daily Show UNLESS you're alreadyinformed about the day's issues from other sources, you know, tired old media. 
And dkblannar, I believe the core mission of the NYT is to be profitable. The best
way for them to be profitable and build on their brand is to do what they do well:
informed, intelligent, reported news articles. What they cannot and never will do well
is compete with hundreds of thousands of college kids to create wacky videos thatget lots of hits on YouTube. Diversifying into music videos and film shorts withyoung actors improvising their hearts out degrades the brand name value of theNYTimes and diverts precious resources from what they CAN do well to areas theywill NEVER do well. The NYTimes website is one of the most successful in theworld and gets zillions of links because of the original news articles and opinionsand reviews. Dumbing down the site and losing track of its core identity - timely,accurate, balanced news coverage of breaking events and in-depth features -- willendanger he very profitability they're striving for. Making themselves look like Yahooor YouTube or some comedy website is a tempting, but very stupid path for them tomake.

The Times is a private company. Your tax dollars aren't involved. Why do you apparently think you
have a vote?
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Who said anything about tax dollars? The NYTimes is a venerable institution that I and many
others respect and read every day (except Saturdays). The trends launched by the NYTimesinvariably influence papers and media outlets around the country. If I think the Times is doinga great job in an area (like that terrific article on arms dealers that I linked to), I applaud it. If I
think it's making a mistake (like diverting energy to time-wasters like music videos and film
shorts that are far, far afield of what it does best), I jeer it. I don't own stock in NBC but I havean opinion on the sitcoms and dramas it airs. What the NYTimes does is far more important.
And as newspapers everywhere struggle to find their footing amidst declining readership and
ads, they're going to make some mistakes. This is one of the them. If you go to the NYTimeswebsite to see film shorts and YouTube exercises in entertainment, by all means email them
and let them know or publish your own commentary. As one of the most important media
outlets in the world, it would be bizarre if people DIDN'T comment on something radically newby the Times. They haven't done it yet, but it would be dumb of them to try developingwebisodes of sitcoms that could be spun off to the major networks or a cable channel. Etc.

The New York Times , "... one of the most important media outlets in the world.",not. Mike, you are one of the few users of HP who would comment that the NYT isan important element of the MSM mix any more. FYI The NYT is no longerAmerica's sole newspaper of record. The NYT can't even be considered to be anewspaper of record among America's newspapers of record. The NYT suffers frompoor writing & editing. One wonders why SLATE includes the NYT in "Today'sPapers". TP is a daily survey of the more important news, etc America's newspapersof record cover. Some consider TP as the de facto list of America's newspapers.Others would object to including the dying, lack luster NYT or USA TODAY, aka
McPaper, a dumbed down paper with national distribution, short stories which use a
limited vocabulary or simple, short words, a number of color photos & simple graphs
& other media short comings in a de facto, informal roster of America's newspapers.
The NYT continues to survive on the basis of the NYT's long past reputation. Rupert
Murdoch, who now controls the Wall St Jl, has said that he wants to drive the NYTout of business. His Rupertship & his editors are turning the WSJ, once the USA'ssole fimancial newspaper of record, into a general interest paper. Some feel that theUK's, FINANCIAL TIMES's American ed, has become by default America's financialnewspaper of record.
