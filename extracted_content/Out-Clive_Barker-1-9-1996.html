<p>honorable death"). and has given countless media interviews, 
Barker's sexual orientation has so far surfaced only in a round of gay­
press interviews published a year ago to herald his film Lord of 
Illusions. "I think it is strange itwas never more of an issue," says the 
44-year-old Liverpool native. "People came to the house, people met 
my lover, met my best friend, saw this was an all-male household . But 
they never mentioned it. Never even asked the question." 
That should change with Sacrament(HarperCollins). Barker's 
most personal novel yet, which focuses on gay wildlife 
photographer Will Rabjohns, takes AIDS-devastated San Francisco 
as a central setting, and is dedicated to Barker's lover, Malcolm. 
While the novel has moments of gore and hints of magic, its driving 
force is an overarching psychological tension, that deep sense of 
unease that's been Barker's trademark since his first short story 
collection, 1984's Books of Blood: Volume One (which also included 
a tale with a gay protagonist) . 
Despite the forces of evil his imagination continues to muster, 
Barker's new novel clearly signals movement away from the early 
despair of the Books of Blood series to a real sense of optimism. 
"Sacramentis a redemptive story," he says. "And even though it 
plunges very deeply into the things that give me anxiety as a human 
being living in an increasingly spoiled world, I do think there's 
plenty of light at the end of this tunnel." 
Working in genres not known for their social conscience ­
gory books, horror films, fantasy epics-Barker uses his pop 
platform to take on the big issues: man's destruction of life on Earth 
in Sacrament, racism and homelessness in the film Candyman, the 
poverty of the American imagination in his novel The Great and 
Secret Show. "One of the things that horror does is deliberately 
address issues in a very extreme form," he says. "So it's kind of 
aversion therapy. You getto look at these things in an extreme form 
and, yes, in a safe situation. I think movies in that sense can be 
quite therapeutic ; they can strengthen your antibodies where this 
stuff is concerned ." 
At least one ofthe frightening themes of Sacrament-the 
ravages of disease-continues to play out in the author's own life. 
"All of us live with the notion that we are frail and that we are 
transforming," he says. "My father contracted leukemia six months 
ago. You know, there's my dad-the cornerstone of my life-and 
here is this thing which is in his body and part of him, doing its 
vicious thing." (His father is currently in remission.) 
Not your average paperback writer, Barker is also an artistwho 
has exhibited his paintings at major galleries and illustrated a 
number of his own stories. He's now editing a second collection of 
his plays (titled Forms of Heaven) and keeping an eye on Paramount 
Pictures' animated production of his children's book The Thief of -~ 
Always. "I think it's importantto hold on to the 19-year-old inside who 
says, 'I can do that: because you don't know until you try," he says. 
With that in mind, he's juggling story ideas that may take him 
into science fiction and erotica. As is evident in Sacrament, where 
gay sex is part ofthe natural terrain, a respectforthe sensual has 
always been a part of his work. "Sex and arousal is one of the 
places where our minds look atthe world with a kind of clarity," 
says Barker. "It's one of the places in our regular lives, our normal 
lives, where we get a sense of holiness."-MICHAEL G ILTZ
