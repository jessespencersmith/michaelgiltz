6/18/2005 12:00:00 PMIt's not bad enough that Bush pretends he wants to spreadfreedom around the world but then coddles ugly repressiveregimes like Uzbekistan, which boils alive dissidents and is oneof the nastiest governments in the world. But offer Bush amilitary base and he becomes dizzy with delight. So we'veprovided aid to this horrible government and when it gunneddown hundreds of its own people and NATO countries wantedto investigate, Bush blocked it because he's a stand-up guyand we can't have an investigation into terror interfering withthe war on terror.But it turns out we're not just shielding Uzbekistan. Accordingto the New York Times, we've armed and trained the very unitsthat were involved in the massacre of hundreds of innocentUzbekistan citizens. Mind you, the NYT published our implicitinvolvement in such a horror on the dead news day ofSaturday.The United States has worked closely with Uzbekistan,a corrupt and autocratic state with a chilling humanrights record, in the fight against internationalterrorism. It has also tried to professionalize theUzbek military, improve its border security and helpsecure materials that could be used in nuclear,chemical or biological weapons - areas of engagementthat American officials say are of clear nationalinterest.But such policies can backfire, improving the martialabilities of units that commit crimes against Uzbekcitizens, and associating the United States withrepression in the eyes of Uzbek people and the Islamicworld. Uzbekistan is an overwhelmingly Muslimcountry with severe restrictions on freedoms ofworship and expression.But actually this massacre is just another success story.Uzbekistan described it as "a counterterrorism operation." Boy,they learn fast.
