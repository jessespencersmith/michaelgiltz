            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  D E C E M B E R  1 2 ,  2 0 0 7Oh, FuckI was reading the New Yorker tonight and twice the magazine used theword "fuck" in casual settings. Once, in a front of the book storyinterviewing Rufus Sewell -- who stars on Broadway in "Rock and Roll"-- about his musical tastes. Sewell was a huge Bowie fan as a kid."My brother called me the Fat White Duke," says Sewell to the NewYorker. "I dyed my hair -- blond in the front, orangey on top. I was anearly adopter of 'bad haircut.' I was really into 'David Live.' 1974. Bowiewas absolutely drug-fucked. That's when he was living on peppers andmilk."That caught my eye, for the use of the word in print AND its clevercompounded context of "drug-fucked."Then a few pages later, David Sedaris in a comic piece about airlinetravel describes the dirty looks he gets when sitting in first class andthe people headed for Coach glance his way."The looks they gave me as they passed were the looks I give when thedoor of a limousine opens. You always expect to see a movie star, or, atthe very least, someone better dressed than you, but time and timeagain it’s just a sloppy nobody. Thus the look, which translates to 'Fuckyou, Sloppy Nobody, for making me turn my head.'”Twice in one issue and not even in the context of say, war reportingwhere you want to capture the salty vernacular of the soldiers. Just acasual use of the word and no blushing necessary. A fucking line's beencrossed, is what I think.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
