            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 2 ,  2 0 0 7Renee Richards -- Changing Her Mind?The NYTimes has a combative and somewhat tacky profile of Dr. ReneeRichards, who made headlines around the world when she had a sexchange and competed professionally in women's tennis. It's headlined"The Lady Regrets" (fair enough, since she ends her new autobiographylisting a series of regrets), says talking to her you get the feeling "of thatimpatient male surgeon trapped in her body trying to get out" and soon. That's pretty amazing to say, since her entire life has beenstruggling with the fact that Richards had a FEMALE surgeon trappedin her body trying to get out. It twists an old comment into suggestingher sex change was a mistake. Richards has said very clearly she wishesshe HADN'T been a woman trapped in a man's body that needed a sexchange. She was practically the first person in the US to do so, it was anextremely difficult battle to win and took many years and she wasvilified and treated like a freak by the media for years. She says clearlyand repeatedly that she has never regretted getting the sex change --she just says she wishes it hadn't been necessary in the first place. Butbecause it WAS necessary, she's never wished she hadn't done it. Notfor a moment. I have a profile of Richards in an upcoming issue of TheAdvocate, so maybe I'm just jealous: I got a cookie but the NYTimes gotan entire lunch.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
