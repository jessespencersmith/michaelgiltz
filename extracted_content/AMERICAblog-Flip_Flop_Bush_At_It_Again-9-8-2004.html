9/08/2004 01:24:00 PMGeorge "flip flop" Bush is at it again.Bush was against the 9-11 commission before he was for it. (Flip-flop!)Bush was against giving them mounds of pertinent evidence beforehe was for it. (Flip-flop!)Bush was against the commission finishing its work before theelection until he was for it. (Flip-flop!)Bush was against the commission extending its deadline (necessarybecause Bush had dragged his feet in cooperating) before he was forit. (Flip-flop!)Bush was against testifying before he was for it. (Flip-flop! Though heremained firm on being too afraid to testify alone.)Bush was against Condi testifying before he was for it. (Flip-flop!)Bush was opposed to an intelligence czar before he was for it. (Flip-flop!)And now Bush was opposed to an intelligence czar with anybudgetary authority before he was for THAT. (Flip-flop!)
