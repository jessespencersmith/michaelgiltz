 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Road To Mecca" Proves
Bigger Is Not Always Better
THE ROAD TO MECCA  ** 1/2 out of ****
ROUNDABOUT THEATRE COMPANY
It's so difficult not to lose your shirt when producing
theater that one feels churlish wishing a revival of Athol
Fugard's drama The Road To Mecca were in a tinier, Off
Broadway house. The American Airlines Theatre is
hardly sprawling -- it's the fourth smallest house on theGreat White Way. And yet even it feels too large for thisintimate, modest, three person drama.
Fugard's tale is a simple one. Miss Helen (the great Rosemary Harris) is an elderly widow who lives onher own in an isolated town in South Africa in 1974. Since her husband died 15 years earlier, she's beencreating what we would call folk art, fantastical (or monstrous) cement figures that fill her yard and homeuntil there's not enough room for even a radish to grow. We take this on faith since unlike the originalNew York production, none of those giant, disturbing sculptures are visible to us. Al we see is a warm,expansive home with lots of candles, small hand-crafted works throughout, a glittering ceiling (createdwith ground-up beer bottles) and walls painted with streaks of orange and blue. To us it seems warm andinviting; to her fellow Afrikaners at the time, the word they would use would be closer to unhinged.
Miss Helen receives an unexpected visitor -- the English South African schoolteacher Elsa (a fine Carla
Gugino), an English woman of South Africa being considered inherently freer, more modern, less"traditional" than an Afrikaner like Miss Helen. They are also, of course, from different generations.(This is not a play that focuses on race and prejudice, though of course every play of Fugard has suchreality woven throughout it.) Miss Helen needs Elsa's support because the local man of the cloth Marius(an excellent Jim Dale) is coming to get her signature on a consent form so Miss Helen can be movedinto an old folk's home.
Essentially, we spend the first half of the play hearing hints about a mysterious letter from Miss Helen,
tragic events of 15 years ago, problems for Elsa and the looming, threatening appearance of Marius. Inthe second half, we discover exactly what happened 15 years ago, the contents of that letter, the unhappystate of Elsa's life and a showdown where the three of them sort out their complicated feelings for oneanother.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>It's quiet, sometimes affecting and directed smoothly if not piercingly by Gordon Edelstein. The set by
Michael Yeargan perhaps could have been more of a presence to give us a better sense of Miss Helen's
significance as an artist. The lighting by Peter Kaczorowski felt a little abrupt. Suddenly the stage would
seem far dimmer than a moment earlier and then a character would comment that the sun was setting.Snuffing out one candle at one or two points had a similarly dramatic effect, rather than the subtle onecalled for.
The three actors prove themselves capable of a great deal, even if this production doesn't make the most
of Fugard's play. Gugino really impressed me at first, but my confidence wavered as the show went on.Perhaps it's just a modern, savvier attitude towards the elderly, but Elsa seemed rather clueless and meanto Miss Helen at times. And her character's big moment felt tacked on after it seemed to me the businessof the show was over. I felt alternately a bit annoyed and a bit confused by this woman. When a show isthree quarters of the way over and you're still trying to puzzle out the dynamics between these two
characters, something is wrong. (How long have they known each other? Is Elsa like a daughter? A
friend? A crutch? And why exactly does Elsa travel so far to visit this woman? And if the friendship of
Miss Helen means so much, why does Elsa complain about coming on short notice for what is clearly a
crisis?)
Harris had a better time as Miss Helen, but I was never quite sure what we were supposed to think of
this woman either. Was she a talented artist? (The show is based on the life of a real Afrikaner whosehome is now a national monument, so presumably that's the intent.) For all we know, her sculpturemight indeed just be a hobby, albeit an admirable one. Even the intriguing modernist poster for thisproduction is bolder than anything we see from Miss Helen. At times she appears a confused frail oldwoman while at other points she's a vibrant figure who knows exactly who she is. Characters can containcontradictions of course, but in this case it seemed the show that was confused, not Miss Helen.
But Dale was a revelation to me, never having had the chance to see him onstage before, I think. His
Marius is crystal clear every step of the way. We're told he's a scheming man trying to oust Helen from
her home. But when he arrives we find a reasonable, if mannered fellow who might just have her best
interests at heart. Dale slowly reveals layers and layers to deepen our understanding of this man, as
opposed to our whipsaw emotions about the two women.
Each has strong moments and the three of them make it a show worth seeing. But I can't help preferring
it was in a smaller space that would allow these three actors (who never overact, mind you) the intimacythe piece calls for. And I wish this production had developed a clearer idea of these two women so wecould see Fugard's play more clearly as well.
