Religious Right Turns On Bush
by Michael in New York  on 7/12/2004 10:58:00 PM
The New York Times buried this story on an inside page,
characterizing it as being about social conservatives peeved that
more of their far right leaders aren't speaking at the Republican
convention. But this is actually a much bigger story about how
everyone on the religious right is FURIOUS at Bush. They're mad
because he doesn't gay bash enough; they're mad that he
endangered their tax exempt status by trying to turn local churches
around the country into campaign headquarters for his reelection;
they're mad that he's afraid to let the country know how radically farright he is (Bush agrees with them that science is for losers; thateveryone deserves equal rights except for infidels, women, gays,
agnostics, atheists and so on) and they are letting him know it.
Quoting top radical right figures who say that if Bush is tooembarrassed to stand by him during the convention, why thenmaybe they'll be too embarrassed to stand by him on election day?Shocking. One more sign that less than four months before theelection and things are not going well for Bush.
