8/24/2004 10:11:00 PMBush might want to file a complaint that North Korea is working forJohn Kerry. Surely there can be no other explanation for the streamof insults directed at Bush by that mad, Orwellian nightmare of adictatorship. Among the choicer complaints:Bush is "an imbecile, ignorant, a tyrant and a man-killer," accordingto a diplomatic spokesman. Bush is "a tyrant that puts Hitler into theshade." Bush's allies are "a typical gang of political gangsters. Andthen, apparently running out of steam, he said Bush is "a bad guy."Who said Dubya wasn't a uniter?
