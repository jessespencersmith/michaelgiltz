9/03/2004 02:08:00 PMWhy shouldn't George Bush be happy? The latest job figures showhim on track for the best year of his presidency. Unfortunately forhim, his BEST year is weaker than Bill Clinton's WORST year. The LATimes reports Kerry smartly putting it in perspective."Kerry, in a statement issued before his first campaign event todaylooked back at the overall loss of jobs across Bush's tenure, and said:'President Bush is now certain to be the first president since the GreatDepression to face re-election without creating a single job.'"Since Herbert Hoover we have had eleven presidents: FranklinDelano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F.Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter,Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. These presidentshave faced wars and recessions, but not one of them has failed tocreate a single job,' Kerry said."Kerry is starting to come out swinging strong on every issue. Abouttime.
