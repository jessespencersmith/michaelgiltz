Malcolm X: 
~P -al Edition 
I'< *1/2 
Warner Bros., $26.99 
Thank God (or should one say 
Allah?) that director Spike Lee 
fought tooth and nail to direct 
this film and then passed the 
hat to get it finished. It's his 
masterpiece, thanks in no 
small part to Denzel 
Washington's measured, bril­
liant performance. Extras 
include a fine 1972 documen­
tary about Malcolm X, as well 
as a lengthy, entertaining mak­
ing-of feature. Also just out: 
"Slavery and the Making of 
America" (Ambrose, $79.99), a 
four-part PBS documentary 
narrated by Morgan Freeman. 
Deadwood: 
First Season **** HBD, $99.98 
This brutal, foul-mouthed, 
wonderfully entertaining 
western started out very 
strong and got better and 
better. It's the best show on 
TV. The cursing has a point 
-as detailed in documen­
taries about the making of 
the show and interviews 
between creator David Milch 
and actor Keith Carradine. 
Also out: "Murder One: First 
Season" (Fox, $59.98), anoth­
er terrifically well acted 
drama. The Martin 
5corsese Film 
oJlFon 
What better way to 
prod the minds of 
Oscar voters than 
this boxed set of four 
disparate movies by 
Scorsese. Two of 
them -1972's 
"Boxcar Bertha" and 
1977's "New York, 
New York" -are a 
mixed bag. But 1978's 
"The Last Waltz" is 
one of the great 
concert films and 
1980's "Raging Bull" 
-in a lavish new 
edition with 
commentary and 
extras -is 
overwhelming in its 
greatness. 
The Notebook 
Zero stars 
New Line, $27.95 
Director John Cassavetes pio­
neered raw, urgent drama with 
movies like "A Woman Under 
The I~uence." So this weepy, 
stunnmgly conventional melo­
drama by his son Nick 
Cassavetes can only be seen as 
the most rebellious movie of 
the year. The story of a wrong­
side-of-the-tracks romance 
between Ryan Gosling and 
Rachel McAdams was a word­
of-mouth hit. As was "Shark 
Tale" (DreamWorks, $29.99), 
the animated movie also pillo­
ried by critics but a hit at the 
box office. 
Miami Vice: 
~~~onOne 
Universal, $59.98 
Michael 
Mann's fea­
ture film 
version of 
this iconic 
show (set to 
star Colin 
Farrell and 
Jamie Foxx) 
could be a 
lot of fun. 
But it won't really be "Miami 
Vice," which is firmly rooted 
in the '80s, thanks to the cloth­
ing, the pop songs and Don 
Johnson's star turn.</p>
