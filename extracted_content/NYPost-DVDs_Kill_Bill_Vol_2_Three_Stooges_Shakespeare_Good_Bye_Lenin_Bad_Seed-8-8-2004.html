This week's DVDs By MICHAEL GlLTZ 
Kill Bill: Vol. 2 * * * 
Miramax, $29.99 
Finally, fails can watch both halves of Quentin Tarantino's "Kill 
Bill," afilm about a bride on a rampage. "Vol 2" is a slow-paced, 
thoughtful ode to spaghetti westerns. Uma Thurman shines and 
David Carradine deserves his career resurgence. But fans will 
have to wait for a special edition with both f1lm.s and lot or extras, 
The Three Stooges 
in ChromaChoice 
**1/2 
Columbia Pictures, $24.96 
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! It's hard to 
imagine anyone demanding to 
watch the Three Stooges in 
color. Nevertheless, Columbia 
offers two new DVDs -
including ~'Goofs On The 
Loose" -with four shorts in 
both black and white and 
"ChromaChoice," aka the 
dreaded colorized versions. 
Didn't we leave this goofy idea 
behind? You'd be much better 
offwith "The Flying Deuces" 
(1939), a lovingly restored 
Laurel and Hardy classic 
($24.95, Kino) that's fuIinier 
and has fIve shorts as extras. 
Shakespeare: The 
Animatedlales 
*** Abrose, $79.99 
These Russian animated shorts 
with voices by members of the 
Royal Shakespeare Company 
aren't dumbed down for kids -
just condensed , 25-minute takes 
on 12 classic tales .. The styles 
vary from classic cel animation 
("Othello") to haunting paint­
on-glass ("Hamlet") and 
puppetry ("The Winter's Tale"), 
all nicely done. Tilda Swinton, · 
Antony Sher and Michael 
Kitchen-are among the stars 
involved in this intriguing, 
unusual project. Good Bye. Lenin! 
***1/2 
~ony, $29.95 __ _ 
An East German mom falls into 
a coma and 'Once she awakens, 
her son (Daniel Bruhl) tries to 
maintain the illusion that the 
Berlin Wall never fell. But this 
unanticipated hit has 
surprising depth and subtly 
demonstrates how maintaining 
a lie can be so important that 
nothing else matters. Includes 
the usual extras, like 
commentary and deleted 
scenes. 
The Bad Seed 
*** Warner Bros., $19.97 
Both a camp classic and a 
genuinely spooky little flick, 
1956's "The Bad Seed" stars 
Patty McCormack as the most 
devilish little girl in the world. 
But the real treat is the 
hilarious audio commentary 
with McCormack and 
theatrical legend Charles 
B.usch. 7
