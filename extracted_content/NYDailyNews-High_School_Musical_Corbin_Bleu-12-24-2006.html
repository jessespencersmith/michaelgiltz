The TV phenomenon arrives 
Xi ' -"In concert BY MICHAEL GlLTZ 
The Disney 1V movie "High School Musical" was the biggest 
pop cultural phenomenon of 2006 -and it's set to be the 
biggest one of 2007 as well. The "Grease"-like songfest was 
an unprecedented hit on cable, airing repeatedly and draw­
ing massive viewership every single time. The soundtrack is the 
best-selling album of the year. Most of the cast members are on 
tour with the show, hitting Nassau Coliseum on Dec. 29 and New: 
Year's Eve. And in February they start filming the sequel. 
For star Corbin Bleu - a veteran 
actor and dancer even though he's only 
17 years old -the fun has only begun, 
"I'm actually on the tour bus riding 
to the next stop," says Bleu, who plays 
basketball star Chad Danforth and best 
buddy to the hero, Zac Efron. (In the 
film, Efron wants to play basketball 
but also is drawn to the smart new girl 
and the possibility of auditioning in the 
school's new musicaL) 
"There are like six buses," says Bleu, 
the son of parents who are also in the 
entertainment business . "I'm in my little 
bunk right now. Oh, my gosh," he says, 
sounding exactly like someone who'd 
be in a high school musical, "we're hav­
ing so much fun." 
Bleu is performing to some 15,000 
fans a night and trying to map out his 
schedule for the next year, 
"While I'm on tour, my new movie 
'Jump In" premieres Jan 12 on the DIS­
ney Channel," he says, In it, Bleu stars 
as a teen boxer who gets drawn into the 
world of competitive jump roping (you 
read that right). His dad -played by Bleu's real·life dad, actor David ReiverS,' 
-is not amused. 1 
"Then I got back to Hawaii to film " 
the two-hour finale to my Discovery 
Channel show, 'Flight 29 Down' [a se­
ries about people stranded after a plane 
crashl. Then I go to Utah to film 'High 
School Musical 2: And while I'm out 
there, my first solo album will come out 
in April. There's so much going on right 
now." 
In the past year, Bleu has made his 
first trip to Europe (where "HSM" was 
also a big success), gone to the Emmys 
(where Rosie O'Donnell thrilled him by 
saying how much she loved (he movie) 
and finally heard himself on the radio 
when the single "Push It to the Limit" 
(which is on his first solo album) got 
some airplay, Didn't that happen with 
"High School Musical"? 
"No'" Bleu laughs. "I don't have any 
solos in 'High School MusICal' The only 
time you actuall~\.' hear m.Y voin·' is on 
'Stick to the Status Quo,' when' ,OU can 
hear ll1e say the WOl U 'Wh,II')' But al 
least 1 got a dance solo' •</p>
