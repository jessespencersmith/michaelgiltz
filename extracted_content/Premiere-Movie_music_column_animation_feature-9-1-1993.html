            <p>ANIMATION INSPIRES THE 
best and worst in film 
scoring. The music is 
often dismissed as little 
more than the simple­
minded mimicry of what's hap­
pening onscreen-and it some­
times is. On the other hand, 
animated movies have had mu­
sical scores worthy of Broad­
way and sophisticated sound­
tracks in the classic Hollywood 
tradition. Here's a sampling. 
• Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs (Walt Dis­
ney). The Disney 
standard in almost 
every way-what 
Beauty and the Beast et 
al. are measured 
against. Lighthearted 
tunes ("Heigh-Ho") 
and songs of gentle 
yearning {"Some Day 
My Prince Will 
Come"} combine 
with rarely matched 
ease. A delight. HEAR HERE 
SCO.ING 
ties," "I Wan'na Be Like You," 
and a handful of others equally 
good. 
• Stay Awake (A&M). A 
quirky, memorable Disney 
tribute album, on which con­
temporary artists perform 22 
tunes from the studio's films in 
a wide range of styles (e. g., 
Harry Nilsson's "Zip-A-Dee­
Doo-Dah" and Aaron Neville's 
"Mickey Mouse March"). 
• The Tune (Newport Clas­
sic). Bill Plympton's droll 
• The Jungle Book 
(Walt Disney). This 
buoyant score of un­
flagging wit features

Very left field and very funny. 
• The Lord of the Rings (In· 
trada). Leonard Rosenman' :

dispels any notion that animat· 
ed movies can't benefit from­
or don't deserve--a seriou: 
composer's attention. While 
more modest in its goals, Jerq 
Goldsmith's The Secret 0 
NIMH (Varese Sarabande' 
proves the same point.

distracting dialogue.
