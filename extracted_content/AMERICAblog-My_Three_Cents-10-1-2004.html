10/01/2004 05:55:00 AMWow, this post-debate coverage is heady stuff. I've forgotten what Iseen and only remember that Kerry won! Kerry won! He's got themomentum! Yep, it's not really about my own personal analysis, it'sabout how the general public saw it and how it plays out in themedia.Day One looks great, with most people saying Kerry won the debate.Bush's tired repeating of one or two talking points wore people out.His body language and facial expressions were a catalog ofindifference, pettiness and a man deeply uncomfortable in his ownskin. It's probably the worst debating night of his life.Now how do we keep the Bushies from setting up debate two as hischance for a comeback? Keep repeating what John said: all Kerry hasto do is look presidential.Keep saying, "Oh George Bush had a terrible night so of course he'sgoing to do better the second time." Beat them to the comebackstory so that even if Bush shines it's only what the Dems insisted allalong was the least we can expect from Bush. "Remember, he's wonevery debate of his career before these so of COURSE he'll learn fromhis mistakes and end all that wretched body language (weren't thosegrimaces of his a hoot, Matt and Katie?) and do much, much better.Frankly, we're just hoping Kerry can hold his own, Ted. You knowBush is going to improve dramatically in the next debate."Raise the expectations to grandiose heights and then watch him fallshort and admit, gee, maybe he really is in trouble.
