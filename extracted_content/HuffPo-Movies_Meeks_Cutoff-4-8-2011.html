 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyHuffPost Review: Meeks' Cutoff
MEEK'S CUTOFF  *** 1/2 out of ****
Opening day in limited release
Director Kelly Reichardt gets better and better with
every film, and here she fulfills the promise of Old Joy
and Wendy & Lucy . The latter starred Michelle Williams
as a woman who lost her dog; her central rivetingperformance kept the slight story afloat.
Here, Williams is part of a marvelous ensemble, and
while the plot comes fast and furious, it's presented in alow-key, ambiguous manner that suits Reichardt to a"t." In this Western set during the 1800s, three families
are headed west with their guide Meek (Bruce
Greenwood). Meek is either lost or being urged by residents of the Territory they're headed for to steer
newcomers away to a certain death. (Too many Americans might turn the Territory over to the U.S. in avote, something certain independent settlers want to avoid.) Meeks may be clueless or cruel but theyundoubtedly need water. The capturing of a "savage" gives them a chance to ignore Meeks and use thisman to save them.

<p>There you go. That it's, all delivered in an open-ended manner sure to frustrate general audiences. But
what a cast Meek's Cutoff  offers. Paul Dano is wonderful as a weak-willed man who only seems strong
compared to his hysterical wife (Zoe Kazan), a woman who sees Indians lurking behind every tree. The
inestimable Shirley Henderson is wittily on target as a woman constantly keeping an eye on her
wandering son and a husband who refuses water when it's scarce (to all of their detriment). Greenwood
is wonderfully offbeat as the guide, and Will Patton is a rock of common sense as the husband of
Williams, though their relationship is a little tense. (She's his second wife, and he seems uncertain about
this woman with opinions.)
Without a hint of modernism, Williams creates a strong, fascinating character who insists on seeing the
captured "savage" (Rod Rondeaux) as a man and not just an object of scorn or even pity. Exceptionallywell-acted, quiet and observant, Meek's Cutoff  is pure arthouse fare, which is meant as a warning for
those who might want, you know, a little action or some answers, and as praise for a talented directorcoming into her own.

So I won't miss this new collaborat ion with Kelly Reichardt. It looks promising.
Even the poster for this movie is excellent.
I hadn't seen the poster but checked it out thanks to your recommenda tion. It is indeed
very cool.
