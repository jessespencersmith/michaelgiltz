<p>THE FIGHTER  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular; Paramount) -- I wish I liked The Fighter  more than
I do. It's a passion project for Mark Wahlberg, a very good actor with good taste in scripts. It's bursting
with talent, including Oscar winners Melissa Leo as Wahlberg's pushy mom and Christian Bale as hisdrug-using brother. And it gives the talented director David O. Russell another hit to his credit. Great.Unfortunately, the story is so familiar and rote that you wait in anticipation for some curve ball, somenew insight that never comes. Further, the fights are shot to mimic the style of TV coverage back in theday. That's an interesting choice aesthetically but it means the fights themselves are fairly dull to watch.It's a decent film with Amy Ryan and especially Wahlberg very good again. It's just hard to think ofanything new here worth your time.
HEREAFTER  ($35.99 BluRay combo; $28.98; Warner Bros.) -- After a disturbingly realistic tsunami in
the opening scenes, Hereafter settles into a rather dull story of a reluctant psychic (Matt Damon)constantly hounded by people who want him to use his gifts to give them solace and closure. He justwants a normal life but it's not to be. The similarly-themed Biutiful  has an excellent performance by
Javier Bardem and a darker tone to recommend it. Here Clint Eastwood never seems to dig into thematerial with any passion. That's not true on the extras where Eastwood holds forth on his entire careerin a very lengthy interview that is engaging and fun to hear.

<p>YI YI  ($39.95 Criterion BluRay)
AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS  ($39.95; Criterion BluRay) -- People throw around words like
"masterpiece" with casual abandon. Not me, I promise you. But here are two masterpieces. You'll find
them both among my lists of the best films of all time  -- Au Revoir  is my favorite film from 1987, one of
the best years for movies in history, in my opinion. And Yi Yi  was an instant classic for me in 2000. It
would have been my #1 pick except for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,  one of the best action
adventure films of all time and another masterpiece. You owe it to yourselves to watch both of them and
Criterion makes it a pleasure more than ever. Yi Yi was previously out on a disastrously poor DVD release
that was the only available copy for years. It was still watchable, but it deserved much better. Au Revoirhas had fine releases but Criterion always raises the bar. I love that they include the Charlie Chaplinshort seen only briefly in the film. Yi Yi is a group portrait of a middle class family in Taiwan. You'll get toknow them all but at the heart of it is a little boy so wise and clever and with such a wonderful outlook onlife you'd swear he's the reincarnation of the Buddha. (That is not a plot point, by the way.) Au Revoir isbased on a childhood memory of director Louis Malle about the Jewish boys hidden in their Catholicboarding school during WW II until the Nazis come and ferret them out. It's heartbreaking and lovely. Iinterviewed Malle shortly before his death and did something I rarely do which was to praise this film inperson and say how much it meant to me and how I believed he had done his memory justice. He's usedto praise and probably forgot it an hour later but I was glad I did it.

<p>MICHAEL JORDAN TO THE MAX  ($19.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)
ULTIMATE JORDAN DELUXE LIMITED EDITION  ($69.98 BluRay; Image)
THE ULTIMATE WAVE TAHITI 3-D  ($24.98 Image)
WALKING ON WATER  ($14.94; Sony) -- Okay, lots of sports documentaries. Michael Jordan To The
Max  is a terrific looking 46 minute movie created for IMAX in theaters. It looks just great if you want a
demo DVD and love Jordan. The same is true for the 45 minute Ultimate wave Tahiti BluRay. (It
contains both the BluRay and BluRay 3-D version; my TV is not 3-D compatible.) If you're really intoeither of these sports, this brief but amazing looking flicks could work for you. Ultimate Jordan is a muchmore substantial collection of four highlight films from Jordan's career as well as five key games from his
career in their entirety along with other extras. Unfortunately, it's a huge letdown if you watch the IMAX
movie first because these pre-HD titles have not been remastered sufficiently or the source material is sodegraded that it kind of seems subpar. If you're a fanatic, you've been warned; the content is great.Finally, Walk On Water  follows surfers Tyler Hallen and Luke Davis as they travel the world looking for
some gnarly waves but end up finding Jesus.

Spurlock...THE SWITCH  ($39.99 BluRay combo and $29.95 regular DVD; Lionsgate)
BURLESQUE  ($34.95 BluRay combo and $28.95 regular DVD; Screen Gems) -- Why aren't Jennifer
Aniston and Jason Bateman bigger movie stars? Because they -- or their agents/managers -- can't pick
good scripts. Even when Anniston is in a hit film, it's usually bad and she doesn't get the "credit" as far as
Hollywood is concerned. Bateman can't seem to get any traction despite being in great movies like Up In
The Air  and Juno , cult favorites like Extract  and hits like Hancock  and Couples Retreat.  The Switch  will
change nothing for either of them, despite being a romantic comedy about best friends who, surprise,finally realize they're perfect for each other. And I wish Burlesque  were much better or much worse than
it is, but you can't have everything. It just... is.
SHARKTOPUS  ($24.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay) -- This movie is a different kind of bad. It's the Saturday
night SyFy scare-fest starring a ridiculous creature that's "half shark, half octopus, all killer!" Of course
it's awful. But with a name as silly as that and an awesome poster you kind of want to see it anyway,don't you? And thus was the drive-in movie born. Even Roger Corman thought it was a bit much but thathasn't stopped him from presenting it, has it?
