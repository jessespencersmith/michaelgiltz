9/12/2005 11:38:00 PMIf you're lucky enough to ever be introduced to Secretary ofState Condi Rice, I suggest you look her in the eye, say "Niceshoes" and walk away. Imagine the toll that would take if Ricemet this again and again. They can't hide in photo ops atwealthy communities for the rest of their lives. If you meetDick Cheney, ask him "How did you enjoy your vacation whilethousands of Americans died?" Or you can be crasser and moredirect. If you know Rice is appearing somewhere in yourvicinity, make up a sign that says "NICE SHOES" and makesure she -- and the MSM -- sees it. Until they apologize forabandoning America during the worst natural disaster in ourcountry's history, they don't deserve anything less.
