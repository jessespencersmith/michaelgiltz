            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  D E C E M B E R  0 6 ,  2 0 0 6"Gilmore Girls" -- Why Do I Keep Watching?It's hard to say goodbye to a show you've loved. But the current seasonof "Gilmore Girls" is beginning to spoil my entire appreciation of theseries. The last two weeks have been especially annoying: Lorelai andRory are now the least likable, most annoying characters on their ownshow! Lorelai and Christopher have been married for about twoseconds and they already seem headed for divorce. So why get themmarried? So they could fight and turn their solid friendship after yearsof estrangement into something bitter and ugly? Thanks. Lorelai'smom used to be smart and together but very difficult and usuallywrong or at least wrong-headed, with Lorelai's witty comments a nicerejoinder. Now Lorelai seems like a spoiled brat unable to spend twoseconds in the company of her mother. Her mom pops up on Lorelai'sdoorstep, offers some heartfelt and well-intended (and good!) adviceand you long for Lorelai to at least say, "Thanks Mom" or reach out toher in some way but she says nothing. And is Christopher an idiot? Aguy we've grown to like is now a moron -- did he really think Lorelaiwould want to move away from Star's Hollow (where her business islocated, I might add) and live in another town nearby? Why? And Roryhas no friends. Her best pal -- Lane -- is pregnant with twins and Idon't think we've seen Rory pay a visit to Star's Hollow to share in thejoy. After years of working on the Yale newspaper, she doesn't even likeany of her coworkers and can't be bothered to go for a drink with themafter they give her a going-away gift. (Believe me, in college journalismcircles, not going for a drink is supremely rude.) Who are her friends?Two idiots we barely know and don't care about. When Logan -- theman she's been pining for -- suddenly appears from London, does Rorydrop everything to be with him? Nope, she insists she has to go to thebirthday party of one of these two gals, whom she's known for all of 30seconds. Does Logan say he'll join her right after his business dinner?Nope. But at least he's not behaving like a child; Logan refuses to lie tocover up the fact that Rory knew her gal pal's boyfriend for years, a factNaked Guy inexplicably wanted to hide. And Luke! Luke wascompletely wrong in promising a 12 year old girl she'd spend all sorts oftime and Thanksgiving and part of the summer with him beforediscussing it with her mom. And then he brutishly threatens all sorts oflegal action against the mom. That could have been a last resort, butwhy couldn't he have made his case first with heartfelt affection for theNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
