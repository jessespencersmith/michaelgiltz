PREVIEW 
Let's all go 
to the lobby 
By Michael Giltz 
*SEPTEMBER * 
A Letter to True 
(September 8, NYC) 
Famed photographer Bruce 
Weber's tone poem on his love 
of dogs typically jumps all over 
the map to cover Dirk Bogarde, 
Elizabeth Taylor, and 9/11. 
Look for godlike beauties scat­
tered casually in the back­
ground. (Zeitgeist) 
Kinsey Scale: 3 
Testosterone 
(September 10, NYC, L.A.) 
Antonio Sabato Jr. is the object 
of David Sutcliffe's desire in this 
gay film noir directed by David 
Moreton (Edge of Seventeen), 
who coadapted James Robert 
Baker's novel with frequent 
Advocate contributor Dennis 
Going for the jug-ular: Selma Blair 
is Ursula Udders in A Dirty Shame, Hensley. (Strand) 
Kinsey Scale: Sabato in the 
altogether? Out talent behind 
the scenes? A 6, of course. 
When Will I Be Loved 
(September 10) 
Writer-director James Toback's 
umpteenth ham-fisted explo­
ration of the straight mating 
ritual is a poor man's Indecent 
Proposal, with Neve Campbell 
playing the pickup artist and 
having a gauzy tryst with anoth­
er woman. (IFC Films) 
Kinsey Scale: 2, though the 
whole film reeks of Toback's 
homy-straight-teenager attitude . 
Merci Docteur Rey 
(September 17, NYC, L.A.) 
Merchant Ivory's gayest movie 
since Maurice stars Dianne 
Wiest as a narcissistic opera 
singer with a gay son addicted 
to phone sex. Add to the mix a 
nervous hustler, a gay dad, fly­
ing lesbians, dead therapists, 
Jerry Hall, Vanessa Redgrave, 
and Jane Birkin (as a nut who 
thinks she's Vanessa Red­
grave). (Regent) 
Kinsey Scale: 3 
Head in the Clouds 
(September 17) 
Real-life amours Charlize Theron 
and Stuart Townsend play star-crossed lovers in this epic ro­
mance set against a backdrop of 
the Spanish Civil War and World 
War II. Completing the triangle is 
Penelope Cruz, who plays a 
dancer-tumed-nurse who was 
Theron's lover before Townsend 
came into the picture. Their les­
bian affair is mostly referred to in 
the past tense, but Theron and 
Cruz do cut a mean tango togeth­
er in this latest film from director 
John Duigan (Flirting, Sirens). 
(Sony Pictures Classics) 
Kinsey scale: 2 
Sky Captain and the World 
of Tomorrow 
(September 17) 
This sci-fi adventure tale sounds 
like a '30s Saturday aftemoon 
serial, looks like an art deco 
reimagining of MetropOlis, and 
stars dreamy Jude Law and 
tough-but-tender Angelina Jolie 
as butch can-do pilot Franky. 
(Paramount) 
Kinsey Scale: 2, if only for the 
nifty production design. 
The Raspberry Reich 
(September 24, NYC, L.A.) 
Bruce LaBruce's latest sexually 
provocative feature focuses on 
modern Germans on the Left 
THE ADVOCATE 1&11 SEPTEMBER 14, 2DD4 who desperately mimic the 
extreme-left movements of the 
'70s. Think what you will ofthis 
outrageous Canadian queer 
punk auteur-he never plays it 
safe. (Strand) 
Kinsey Scale: Achtung, baby, 
it's a 4. 
A Dirty Shame 
(September 24) 
The new John Waters comedy 
stars Tracey Ullman as a 
woman whose accidental con­
cussion puts her sex drive into 
high gear. The NC-17 comedy 
boasts a deliciously quirky cast 
featuring Johnny Knoxville, 
Selma Blair, Chris Isaak, and 
Mink Stole. (Fine Line) 
Kinsey Scale: 4, for Waters 
and for Dirty's trio of sexy gay 
bears, though most of the film's 
couplings are hetero. 
The Forgotten 
(September 24) 
In this paranoid thriller, Julianne 
Moore plays a single mom who 
is told her missing son isn't 
missing--:iust a figment of her 
disturbed imagination . (Bunny 
Lake Is Missing, anyone?) Mak­
ing it all happen are out produc­
ers Bruce Cohen and Dan ~</p>

This earnest Irish film focuses on 
a Catholic Church where priests 
have long-term lovers, where the 
hierarchy ignores those who keep 
their behavior quiet but preaches 
intolerance, and where seminari­
ans look at each other longingly 
in the showers. A handsome 
priest-in-waiting pays the price 
when falsely accused of consort­
ing with a fellow student. (Watch

straight. 
Team America: World Police

new comedy, a mockery of 
bloated action flicks, features a 
team that fights terrorism and 
evildoers around the world. It's 
all performed via marionettes , a 
la the original Thunderbirds TV 
series. Ex pect lots of rude 
jokes, political provocation, and 
more than a few gay references 
that would offend if they 
weren't so funny. (Paramount)
