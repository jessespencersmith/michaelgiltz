            <p>Tale!11 What's the Score? 
enry Mancini said that along with JelT}' Goldsmith, 
Patrick Doyle was the finest musical talent working in 
the movies. Patrick who? Even if his name doesn't have 
the marquee value of a JelT}' Goldsmith or John Williams, Doyle 
is an increasingly visible--and certainly audible--presence. 
Last year, he scored four wildly different movies: Much Ado 
About Nothing, Into the 
West, Needful Things, 
and Carfito's Way. "H 
may have seemed as if I 
were a bit of a sausage 
factory," he says. "But 
they'd been sitti ng 
around for a while." 
Like John Williams with 
Steven Spielberg and 
Bernard Herrmann with 
Alfred Hitchcock, Doyle 
has formed a bond with 
director Kenneth 
Branagh that extends to 
their latest collabora­
tion, Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein. Except for 
Peter's Friends, every 
movie directed by 
Branagh features 
Doyle's unabashedly romantic, full-bodied music. So when he's 
not writing a piece to celebrate the queen mother's birthday or 
turning down commissions for symphonies (much too busy), 
what does Doyle do to relax? No music, please; he reads 
books •.. about other composers. "I've just recently read Ben­
jamin Britten's (biography]," he admits. "And I've just bought 
Verdi's and Berlioz's biographies. I'm desperate to get into 
them." MICHAEl GILTZ</p>
