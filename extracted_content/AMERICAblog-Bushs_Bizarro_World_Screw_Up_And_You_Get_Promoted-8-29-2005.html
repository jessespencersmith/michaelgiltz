8/29/2005 02:56:00 AMBush does it again. Whether you're a major player or small fry,Bush rewards incompetence and attacks anyone who tries tostick to reality. Gen Shinseki said we'd need hundreds ofthousands of troops to secure Iraq (he was right, obviously)and got pushed aside. Last week, one gov't official refused tohide the facts about racial profiling among cops and wasdemoted. Now, Bush has finally been able to demote the bravewoman (a top Army contract official) who denounced long-termno-bid contracts to Halliburton. Bush has no shame.
