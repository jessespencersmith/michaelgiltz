Original Soundtrack 
Madonna 
I'm Breathless 
The release of this summer's blockbuster 
has been 
but three 
contains 
write the 
Elfman -ye 
album by Madonna and a multi-artist com­
pilation are already here. Surprisingly, the 
g.r:ouR effort is more consistent and enjoy­
able .. 
These albums only work when the music 
is linked in some way, such as on the classic 
soundtrack The HRrder To Come, which 
intro UC! a woe generatIon to l"reggae. 
Themostred!m mple was Some­
tftifJ8 W~ a vaguely conceptual w'ork 
whose cuttin -e a tists som~now 
get er. 
It work~ again on DidrTrticy, this time 
i-"'II6ijIilWag, s~~f~tJnh~ tracks are performed 
in the mold of popular music created 
during the '305. Most of the songs also bear 
the imprint of producer Andy Paley: He 
co-wrote all but two songs and his White 
eat Swmg. Orchestra (a nice nod to James 
~agney) provides most of the music. 
The result i~ an -eminently listenable 
al.bum. It kic~ off with a marvelous col­
laboration between k.d. lang and Take 6 
called "Ridin' The Rails." lang slides into 
tlus ode to travelling tramps ("Hoboing is 
my game/ And B & O's my middle name") 
with ease. The whoo-whooing back-up vo­
cals are charming and it passes so quickly 
that you almost don't notice how intricate 
and graceful it is. 
Similar pleasures abound. Jerry Lee 
Lewis shambles through "It Was The Whis­
key Talkin' (Not Me)," Brenda Lee rips up 
the stomper "You're In The Doghouse 
Now" and Darlene Love has a blast with 
"Mr. Fix-It." Like all the songs performed 
here, these three are too well-crafted and 
witty to be considered merely pastiche. 
"Even the songs featuring the rather 
limited vocals of Andy Paley and Tommy 
Page make sense. In the '30s, faceless male 
crooners with thin voices were the rule 
rather than the exception, so they sound 
right at home. 
The only track that doesn't work is Ice­
T's "Dick Tracy." A rap could never sound 
'30s enough to fit in with the album's con-

<p>· .................. -.-.-..-.. -. .----.-..-. ... --.. --..--. 
cept. And the lyrics are too simple-minded 
to allow Ice-T's personality to shine 
through. 
But there are highlights aplenty. "Look­
ing Glass Sea" is a campy treasure from 
Erasure, and "Slow Rollin' Mama" is a very 
obvious double-entendre in which LaVern 
Baker searches for a big, long rollin' pin fo 
her red hot oven. They help make Dick 
Tracy an unexpected delight. 
Madonna's album is also appealing , 
though less successful. Like Dick 1'ra.cy, she 
tries to recreate the mood of the '305. But 
her biggest task was tackling the three 
songs contributed by Stephen Sondheim, 
one of the giants of Broadway musi~als. By 
and large, she does an admirable job.
