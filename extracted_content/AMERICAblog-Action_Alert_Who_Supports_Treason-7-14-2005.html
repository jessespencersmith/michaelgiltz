7/14/2005 02:50:00 PMUPDATE FROM JOHN: Please do call your Senators and Housemembers about Karl Rove. The only reason they're speaking uptoday is because the White House is begging them - Rove is inseriously trouble. We have seen time and again how extremistRepublicans are able to steal the message and spin any crimetheir way. Don't let them. Call your Senators and Housemembers and demand they speak publicly on where they stand- with the traitors or with the troops. Trust me, if enoughmembers of Congress feel the heat, Rove will be toast.Okay, now the gloves are coming off.First the RNC posted an item saying their rank and filemembers are nonplussed about Karl Rove. Really? Whywouldn't Republicans be angry that Bush's right hand manleaked classified information to the press, violated nationalsecurity and endangered the lives of a covert agent and thepeople around the world who worked with her to spreadfreedom and democracy? Don't they love their country?Now the White House is twisting arms and gettingSenators and Congressmen to speak up and say they"support" Karl Rove. Really? Why would you support atraitor? (Ann Coulter likes to throw that phrase around foranyone who disagrees with her. I save it for people whoactually commit treason, such as leaking classified informationduring a time of war.) Why would anyone say, "Yes, I know KarlRove leaked information and lied about being involved and it'striggered a very serious investigation and he might havebroken the law and put our nation's safety at risk but I thinkthat's just dandy"?As the London bombings and 9-11 and the daily death tolls inIraq remind us, this is about life and death. We are at war. Howcan anyone blithely support a government official who leakedclassified info and then lied about it? At best, at BEST, asenator or congressman should say they want to wait until allthe facts are in. At least, anyone with common sense shouldcondemn anyone who leaks national secrets at a time of warand insist anyone doing so should be fired.Where does your Representative or Senator stand ontreason?Phone and email your House members and Senators.The time for fence-sitting is over apparently. According to theWhite House they don't want to talk about the investigation butthey DO want to rally the troops and demand everyone showtheir love for Rove when he lied to the country and leakedclassified info.So do your elected officials support treason, do theysupport outing CIA agents during war time, or do theysupport our troops and our country?Anyone from any party who leaks classified information andendangers national security should be condemned. How faradrift are George Bush and the Republicans that they don't
