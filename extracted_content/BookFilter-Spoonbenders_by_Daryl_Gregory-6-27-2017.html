What We Say
Here's the pitch: "Spoonbenders" is like the Redford-Newman movie "The Sting," but with psychics. And a cute dog. And a
ray gun straight out of Buck Roger)! And it's so unclassifiable and fun you might find it at the bookstore filed under fictionor mystery or even sci-fi, but you should definitely find it now and start reading. The Amazing Telemachus Family were
(almost) world-famous practitioners of E.S.P. and the like...until they are exposed as frauds on "The Mike Douglas Show"
back in the 1970s. Now it's the 1990s and this sad-sack group is burdened by the memory of what might have been. Oh, andthey're burdened by actual psychic powers. (They weren't ALL faking it.) That's not as fun as it sounds. It turns out knowingShare This Book

<p>when someone is lying isn't exactly great for relationships, being able to manipulate objects with your mind won't usually
get you more than some free pinball games and the ability to astral project out of your body is just plain embarrassing
when you're a 14 year old boy and it only works if you're thinking dirty thoughts about your cousin (not by blood!). In this
winning, very funny and grounded novel by Daryl Gregory, the rough life of the Telemachus family is beset by dangers likethe Mafia, shadowy government agencies that know psychic ability is real and even the allure  of online dating. (You can't
tell if someone is lying when reading a computer screen, so it's kind of awesome for a mind reader who wants to try andtrust her date for a change.) "Spoonbenders" has all the genre-flipping fun the premise suggests. But it's also aching and
lovely and sweet, filled with memorable characters like grandfather Ted (who was just a card sharp and con man when he
met the love of his life, a woman with real psychic powers), Irene (who had to grow up too fast when her mom diedbecause even being the World's Greatest Psychic won't protect you from cancer) and Buddy (the child cursed withknowledge of the future who must desperately plan for the climactic showdown and pray he doesn't forget something).Highly recommended. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“Masterful. . . . gracefully balances the outrageous melodrama of Chicago mobsters and shadowy government
agencies with the ordinary mysteries of family dynamics. . . . Readers will emerge from the fray sure they knoweach Telemachus down to the smudges on their hearts. A skillfully written family drama that employs quirk andmagic with grace.” —Kirkus Reviews (Starred) “This gloriously imaginative novel featuring a family of somewhatreluctant psychics has a nifty trick up its sleeve—as whimsical and eccentric as the Telemachus family is, theirhopes and desires perfectly mirror our own. Spoonbenders is hilarious, heartfelt and brimming with humanity.” —
Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney, New York Times bestselling author of The Nest “Imagine amazing powers—but do so
with uncommon creativity, rigor, and humor. You might, if you're lucky, arrive at the delicious drama of the girl
who can smell lies; the all-at-once-ness of the boy who can’t not see the future; the great dilemma of the
psychic pressed into service as a spy. Daryl Gregory's novel traces the line where gift balances against curse andby the end, we realize he isn’t only talking about amazing powers after all. Spoonbenders is X-Files…
