The 45th Annual IRAs -- Argentine film "End Of
The Century" Tops All, but "Once Upon A
Time...In Hollywood" Wins The Most Awards
The 45st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2019
Releases
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society launched in 1976
when it proudly named Stanley Kubrick's  Barry Lyndon  the best film
of the previous year. Officially known as the New York Independent
Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs -- they are
more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial
than the LA Film Critics and more loyal to their favorites than the
Golden Globes. The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best
movies released commercially on any platform in 2019.
Without further ado, the IRA goes to... 
Best Picture:  End Of The Century
Best Director:  Lucio Castro for  End Of The Century
Best Actor: Antonio Banderas  for Pain And Glory
Best Actress:  Lupita Nyong'o for  Us
Best Supporting Actor: Asier Etxeandia  for Pain And Glory  
Best Supporting Actress: Shuzhen Zhao  for The Farewell 
Best Nonfiction Film:  American Factory 
Best Screenplay:   Pedro Almodóvar  for Pain And Glory
Best Cinematography:  David Gallego  for Birds Of Passage
Best Production Design: Barbara Ling for  Once Upon A Time...In
Hollywood 
Best Score/Use Of Music:  Mary Ramos for  Once Upon A Time...In
Hollywood
Best Editing:  Kim Horton  for 63 Up 
Best Costumes: Arianne Phillips for  Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood
Sominex Award (The Movie That Put Us To Sleep):  The Lighthouse 
Dramamine Award (The Movie That Made Us Sick):  Joker
Mechanical Actress: Renee Zellwegger  for Judy  
Mechanical Actor: Joaquin Phoenix for  Joker
In 2019, the IRAs braved a pandemic to cover both the best films of the
1980s and the best of 2019. True, handshakes and hugs were not to be
seen, while snacks were available in individual bowl servings. A small
gathering, following the protocols established by Dr. Sanjay Gupta of
CNN and the evening was both medically responsible and a stirring
example of "the show must go on." Reasons large and small kept four+
anticipated members from attending but we trust the influx of new
members that made 2018 the start of a new, vibrant era for the IRAs
will come through in 2021.  
And now a blow-by-blow description of the night, in order of voting.
We begin, as always, with the category of Best Costumes and the first
voter of the night, Ira. Dressed to the nines, as always, Ira juggled two
absentee ballots and offered up the votes of both Adam Orman and Joe
Smith. Uncannily, without makeup or changing his voice in any notable
fashion, IRA seemed to become, to embody each member as he
delivered their choices in each category. The IRA goes to...
BEST COSTUME
1. Arianne Phillips for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -
- by acclamation  
2. Catherine Rodríguez for  Birds Of Passage  -- 19 pts. (out of a possible
50 pts.)
3. Julian Day for Rocketman -- 16 pts.
4. Mayes C. Rubeo for  Jojo Rabbit -- 11 pts.
5. Jacqueline Durran for  Little Women, 1917 and Peterloo -- 10 pts.
POINT OF ORDER: This year ten ballots were in play. With a top score
for each nominee of 5 pts, the maximum any one nominee could
achieve in any category was 50 pts. However, voting begins with each
member naming their top pick. If a majority of the ballots name the
same winner, this triumph is acknowledged as a win "by acclamation."
However a winner is chosen (by acclamation or by a complete vote),
this is followed by the automatic vote to rescind.
The Vote To Rescind is offered after every single category. Why? Once
the totals are in, members may feel the actual winner doesn't reflect the
best choice. Or perhaps they prefer the runner-up. After the winner is
announced, members are asked to consider a Vote To Rescind. If a
majority of the members actively voting support it, the winner is
rescinded and the runner-up is made the official champion. This is
followed by  another  vote to rescind until the victor is confirmed. It's a
somewhat controversial tactic. But it rarely comes into play more than
once a year. During the 45th Annual IRAs, only one category winner
will be rescinded, much to the displeasure of the group's most ardent
critic of Vote To Rescind and ardent supporter of Once Upon A
Time...In Hollywood .
NOTE: Half the fun of the IRAs is trying to figure out in advance which
films might be contending and then campaigning for your favorite and
blocking the one you like least by talking it down or simply ignoring the
offending flick altogether. (That film? Hardly worth discussing, you
sniff.) This year, four films widely recognized by other critics' groups
and the Oscars threatened to make the IRAs part of the echo chamber
of awards season. Those films are The Irishman, Once Upon A
Time...In Hollywood, Pain and Glory and Parasite. Or, if you prefer,
foreign language fare like Pain and Glory and Parasite which the IRAs
have always celebrated are finally breaking through to the rest of those
lesser bodies. However, it was an excellent year for documentary films.
Might 2019 prove the first year since the still-hotly debated win of Eyes
On The Prize triumphed in 1986 that a doc will take the top prize. Or
will other films like Birds of Passage or the last-minute, where-did-
that-come-from surge for End Of The Century outflank the aging
auteurs? After just one category, it's clear that Quentin Tarantino is
going to be a force to be reckoned with.
BEST EDITING
1. Kim Horton  for 63 Up   -- 24 pts.
2. Nicholas Monsour for  Us -- 14 pts.
3. Chris Dickens for  Rocketman -- 11 pts.
4. Fred Raskin for  Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 10 pts.
5. Lee Smith for  1917  -- 8 pts.
NOTE: When editing was added to the list of categories that the IRAs
vote on, some concern arose it might be dominated by nonfiction films.
Even though many docs have a script, by nature they are often
discovered after filming has ended. Happily, the recent trend of the
editing category being dominated by docs has been snapped. However,
the winner is the latest entry in the documentary epic Up series.
Interestingly, it will not win the Nonfiction Film category, proving that
editing will not just allow a doc to double on wins and that the best
edited film won't necessarily win the top prize as well. In this case, the
deep appreciation and respect for the Up series gave it a deserved leg
up here.
BEST SCORE/USE OF MUSIC
1. Mary Ramos for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood   -
- 17 pts.
2. Michael Abels for  Us -- 14 pts.
3. Jean-Baptise de Laubier and Arthur Simonini  for Portrait Of A Lady On
Fire  -- 11 pts.
4. Leonard Heiblum for  Birds Of Passage  --10 pts.
5. (three way tie) American Factory, Atlantics and Wild Rose  -- 8 pts.
NOTE: The category of Best Score was recently renamed Best
Score/Use Of Music to accommodate the endless ways in which films
make use of music. More proof that Once Upon A Time means
business. On the other hand, Tarantino's movies are always known for
their great use of music and its win here wasn't nearly so dominant as
in Costumes. But the real news is the runner up. This makes two
categories in a row where the horror film Us takes second place,
presaging the film's win of a major category. In third place, we list the
official composers are correctly honored. However, Portrait Of A Lady
On Fire  is being singled out not for its modest score but for how music
is so sparingly and strikingly used in the film. Indeed, there is NO score
at all until halfway through the film when women gathered outside
around a fire begin to chant an a cappella tune. (Turns out this seeming
folk song was actually given lyrics by director Celine Sciamma when
she couldn't find the right ancient tune with the rhythm she needed.)
And at the end of the film the other key use of music is a performance
of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. We always list those mentioned in the credits
but in this case it could as easily be Sciamma and Vivaldi.
BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN
1. Barbara Ling  for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood   --
31 pts.
2. Angélica Perea (art direction) and Juan David Bernal (set
decoration) for  Birds Of Passage  -- 25 pts.
3. Ha-Jun Lee for  Parasite  -- 15 pts.
4. Dennis Gassner for  1917 -- 13 pts.
5. Bob Shaw for  The Irishman -- 8 pts.
NOTE: Well, who can dispute that the production design of Once Upon
was a triumph, recreating Los Angeles to perfection? Not the IRAs,
certainly. However, it's worth noting that Birds Of Passage  was a very
close second indeed. The house in Parasite and the trenches of WW I
were also honored, with The Irishman bringing up the rear. That film
once seemed a comer but proved to be a non-factor throughout the
night. Martin Scorsese was rightly honored by seeing Raging Bull make
the top 10 of the IRA's list of the 100 Best Films of the 1980s (see
below, waaaay below). The Irishman? Not so much.
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
1. David Gallego  for Birds Of Passage  -- 26 pts.
2. (tie) Claire Mathon for  Atlantics and Portrait Of A Lady On Fire -
- 22 pts.
    (tie) Robert Richardson for  Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 22
pts.
4. Roger Deakins for  1917 -- 15 pts.
5. Fejmi Daut and Samir Ljuma for  Honeyland -- 9 pts.
NOTE: Hmm, it's a close battle but the night is proving interesting.
Once Upon A Time has won three of the first five categories and had a
fighting chance in the other two. Here it's tied for second. But Birds of
Passage is proving a contender and wins its first category after being
runner up in two more. And the gorgeously shot Portrait Of A Lady On
Fire gave that a tie for second, thanks to the work of Claire Mathon, a
rare DP who also did excellent work on Atlantics. The great stunt of
1917 got some appreciative nods while the stunning work of the
documentary film Honeyland should have ranked higher. So far, End
Of The Century isn't capitalizing on its buzz, but that's probably
because the low budget indie wasn't going to be a factor in flashy tech
categories like Production Design and Costumes.
FOOD ALERT: Pizza is ordered.
BEST SCREENPLAY
1. Pedro Almodóvar  for Pain And Glory   -- 24 pts.
2. Lucio Castro for  End Of The Century  -- 22  pts.
3. Quentin Tarantino for  Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 21 pts.
4. Joe Talbot & Rob Richert for  The Last Black Man In San Francisco  -
-18 pts.
5. Greta Gerwig for  Little Women  -- 11 pts.
NOTE: Speak of the devil. Suddenly End Of The Century makes its
move. And what a move. It doesn't win Best Screenplay; the autumnal
Almodovar speaks too strongly to the admittedly august members of
the IRAs. But writer-director Lucio Castro edges out Tarantino by a
hair for second place. The complete absence of Birds of Passage is just
as telling a sign of weakness for that film.
BEST NONFICTION FILM 
1. American Factory  -- 28 pts.
2. Honeyland  -- 23 pts.
3. Leaving Neverland -- 13 pts.
4. 63 Up -- 12 pts.
5.  Le Livre d'image -- 7 pts.
NOTE: The Best Nonfiction Film is a recent add to the IRAs and not
without controversy (of course), since creating a category like this
almost ensures a nonfiction film won't win the much-desired top prize
for Best Film.  Nonetheless, it was a rich year indeed. Honeyland
scored a nomination in Cinematography, 63 Up won Editing and
American Factory scored a mention in Best Use Of Music and won the
top prize. All were eligible for Best Picture but failed to break through.
Just as sadly, the Obamas were not on hand to accept their award.
FOOD BREAK
Pizza is eaten. Career highlights and lowlights are dissected, recent
marriages are announced (Mazel tov!), career advancements are
planned (tenure, here we come), various medical aches and pains are
probed, the pandemic is analyzed ad nauseum and so on and so forth. 
And then action resumes!
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
1. Shuzhen Zhao  for The Farewell   -- 28 pts.
2. (tie) Carmiña Martínez for  Birds Of Passage  -- 17 pts.
    (tie) Margot Robbie for  Bombshell  and  Once Upon A Time...In
Hollywood -- 17 pts.
4. (tie) Luàna Bajrami for  Portrait Of A Lady On Fire  --9 pts.
5. Julieta Serrano for  Pain And Glory -- 9 pts.
NOTE: The delightful grandmother "Nai Nai" proved the role of a
lifetime for Zhao, easily besting a strong group. The Freudian analysts
in the crowd noted an IRA propensity for awarding this prize to women
who serve others as mothers, wives and the like with no agency of their
own. Perhaps an issue to raise with their analysts in the months ahead?
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
1. Brad Pitt  for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 20 pts. RESCINDED
2. Asier Etxeandia  for Pain And Glory  -- 19 pts. WINNER
3. Noah Jupe for  Ford v Ferrari and Honey Boy -- 18 pts.
4. Dean-Charles Chapman for  1917 --14 pts.
5. Choi Woo-shik for  Parasite -- 9 pts.
NOTE: Heartbreak for the fans of Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood.
Tensions rose as various people rightly insisted Brad Pitt's role in the
film was a leading role, Oscar win or no Oscar win. A hasty compromise
ensured the two leading supporters of Pitt would both give him five
points (the maximum) when he competed for Supporting and Lead.
And it worked! Pitt won for his excellent turn in the film. However,
whether because they felt he really wasn't a supporting actor or simply
for a desire not to repeat a win at the Oscars, a majority of voters
present voted to rescind, cruelly taking back the prize. it was thus
awarded to the heroin addict actor portrayed in Pain And Glory. 
                                            
BEST ACTRESS
1. Lupita Nyong'o for Us -- 22 pts.
2. (tie) Awkwafina for  The Farewell  -- 16 pts.
    (tie) Camilla Morrone for  Mickey And The Bear -- 16 pts.
4. Saoirse Ronan for  Little Women  --15 pts.
5. (tie) Adèle Haenel for  Portrait Of A Lady On Fire  -- 9 pts.
    (tie) Beanie Feldstein for  Booksmart -- 9  pts.
NOTE: The bubbling under passion for Us came to a boil here with
Lupita Nyong'o triumphing for her turn in that horror film. Michael
stuttered and stammered with confusion and anger, insisting the film
was complete nonsense and what was with the rabbits and that Hands
Across America finale? It made no sense and no one could defend it . In
a Hands Across The Internet moment of solidarity, Aaron agreed
wholeheartedly. The film's ardent supporters were ready with theories,
but the late hour prevented a thorough airing of the dispute. Michael
was heartened by the runner-up status of his passion project for the
year: championing the indie film Mickey and the Bear and its terrific
lead Camilla Morrone. His attempt to champion a vote to rescind since
second place was a tie with the very popular Awkwafina ready for her
closeup along with Morrone was met with sneers of indifference by the
Us contingent. Nice try, they laughed.
BEST ACTOR
1. Antonio Banderas  for Pain And Glory  -- 28 pts.
2. Brad Pitt  for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood   -- 24 pts.
3. Shia LeBeouf for  Honey Boy-- 17 pts.
4. (tie) Juan Barberini for  End Of The Century  --12 pts.
    (tie) Leonardo DiCaprio for  Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 12 pts.
NOTE: Pedro Almodovar's late career triumph hit its peak with the win
of Antonio Banderas for Best Actor, a notable achievement alongside
its trophies for Supporting Actor and Screenplay. Brad Pitt almost won
as Supporting and Lead, but it wasn't meant to be. In an act of integrity
admired by all, Pitt's most fervent and disgruntled champion Andy
refused to vote to rescind the win by Banderas. He objects to the Vote
To Rescind tool and introduced a measure to end it last year. That
measure was rejected. But even when a Vote To Rescind would give
Andy his most cherished win, he refused to bite the apple tantalizingly
offered to him. A tear or two of admiration was discreetly wiped away
by his fellow IRA members. And hmm, the lead actor Juan Barberini
popped onto the list. A last gasp or an indication of better things to
come?
BEST DIRECTOR
1. Lucio Castr o for  End Of The Century  -- 28 pts.
2. (tie)  Pedro Almodóvar  for Pain And Glory  -- 21 pts.
    (tie) Quentin Tarantino for  Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 21
pts.
4. Cristina Gallego & Ciro Guerra for  Birds Of Passage  -- 14 pts.
5. Bong Joon Ho for  Parasite -- 13 pts.
NOTE: And here it is. Thanks to auteur slant of the IRA members (not
officially but present nonetheless), a win for Best Director often
presages a win for Best Picture. And indeed, End Of The Century wins
here and again in a moment. You can see it's close with Almodovar and
Tarantino breathing down its neck as they tie for second. But neither
contingent would sacrifice their favorite to ensure the top prize for an
aging hero.
BEST PICTURE
1. End Of The Century  -- 26 pts.
2. Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 24 pts.
3. Pain And Glory  -- 21 pts.
4. Birds Of Passage  -- 19 pts.
5. Parasite  -- 15 pts.
And so End Of The Century  wins the top prize, beating out Once Upon
by a mere two points.  Fans of Tarantino will surely take comfort in
that film's dominant performance in the tech categories. It won three
and competed everywhere, with two actors in the mix for Lead, an
actress popping into Supporting and the heartbreak of a technical
victory for Brad Pitt that was rescinded. Nonetheless, history
remembers best the film that won and this year it's the enigmatic
Argentinian puzzler End Of The Century, a film that subtly combines
Grindr with The Twilight Zone in a way that Rod Serling would
appreciate. Only time will tell if Lucio Castro can deliver on this early
promise. But for now, he's beginning the century very nicely indeed.
FOOD BREAK 
Best of all, the great night fell on the birthday of IRA member in good
standing David. A birthday cake procured by Andy proved a delicious
capper to the evening. The sugar high may be partially responsible for
the harsh tone of the "negative" awards, which spared neither small
children nor (in an outburst by Michael that seemed more like a brain
aneurysm) beloved filmmakers like Errol Morris. (Michael was not a
fan of American Dharma.) 
SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep)
1. The Lighthouse  -- 14 pts.
2. The Irishman -- 10 pts.
3. The Souvenir -- 9 pts.
4. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire  -- 8 pts.
5. (tie)  Judy -- 6 pts.
    (tie) Marriage Story -- 6 pts.
             
DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick)
. Joker  -- 37 pts.
2. A Beautiful Day In The Neighbor hood --  10 pts.
3. Uncut Gems -- 9 pts.
4. (tie) In Fabric --  8 pts.
    (tie) The Irishman -- 8 pts.
MECHANICAL ACTRESS
1. Renee Zellwegger  for Judy  -- By Acclamation
2. Florence Pugh for  Little W omen --  14 pts.
3. Meryl Streep  for The Laundromat and Little Women  -- 12 pts.
4. Dakota Johnson  for The Peanut Butter Falcon  -- 8 pts.
5. Mindy Kaling for  Late Night -- 7 pts.
NOTE: Like our Mechanical Actor winner , comments throughout the night
made clear Renee Zellwegger would not be going home empty-
handed...unfortunately for her . The buzz surrounding Florence Pugh puzzled
the IRA  members, who instead singled her out in the worst way possible.
Tellingly , both Meryl Streep and Dakota Johnson repeated as Mechanical
Actress winners...and exactly in the same slots they occupied one year
earlier .   
MECHANICAL ACTOR
1. Joaquin Phoenix for  Joker  -- 32 pts.
2. Adam Driver for  The Dead Don't Die, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,
Marriage Story , The Report and Star W ars Episode IX: The Rise Of
Skywalker  -- 16 pts.
3. Robert De Niro for  The Irishman --  16 pts.
4. Azhy Robertson for  Marriage Story  -- 14 pts.
5. Tom Hanks for  A Beautiful Day In The Neighbor hood  -- 6 pts.

WHO OR WHAT ARE THE IRAS? A HISTORY
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the
best films of the year since 1976. Officially known as the New York
Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs --
they are more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more
mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than
the Golden Globes. 
The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained
about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do
better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to
establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is
named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story
lost in the mist of time, alcohol and since it was the 1970s perhaps
cannabis.) The IRAs group has been profiled in  The New Yorker, so it
is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of
it. Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included
Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-selling
and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics,
screenwriters, budding playwrights, film scholars, plain old movie buffs
and so on. 
Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best movies of the
year. The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are
passionate film lovers. Many have careers involving the arts, but it's not
always easy to stay in the swim of things, to keep on top of the flood of
new releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA
members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a
time. The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in
theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) eventually on some
streaming service or DVD. Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay
committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their
college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life,
before jobs and family made frivolous claims on their time. So if you
want to stay on top of great cinema every year or explore its history,
there's no better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs. 
True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the
year than anyone else. But they've been doing it for decades so hey, it's
tradition!
