 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Tyne Daly Delivers a
"Master Class"
MASTER CLASS  ** 1/2 out of ****
MANHATTAN THEATRE CLUB  AT SAMUEL J.
FRIEDMAN THEATRE
Terrence McNally's idea for this play -- to show an opera
singer conducting a master class, complete with nervousstudents, moments of musical glory and the audiencemade complicit as if they were merely attending thatevent rather than a drama -- is so simple and yet richwith possibility, I imagine other playwrights kickedthemselves for not having thought of it first.
McNally made the diva at the heart of the show the
great but aging Maria Callas, her voice shot but her ego
in full force. Callas imperiously asks for the lights to be turned down in the auditorium, demands water,
wonders where the seat cushion she has asked for repeatedly might possibly be, continually brings theconversation back to herself even as she insists this master class is not about her, and almost as an asidecuts to the quick the three promising young singers who have come to perform and get some insights ortips from the great one.

<p>This is the first time I've seen the show and it's easy to imagine the role being played broadly for laughs.
Daly however is a model of restraint. She's funny, astringent and cutting, without ever getting too grandor camp. Two major monologues are a little less successful here. First, Callas has a long conversation withher lover Aristotle Onassis which doesn't come off very convincingly until Callas then segues into thememory of one of her greatest triumphs at La Scala. In the second act, Callas falls into a memory hole yetagain, this time reliving the painful moment when she becomes pregnant and Onassis tells her to get ridof it.
But by and large this is a light drama, played a little too broadly for my tastes by the three actors who
come in to sing. Alexandra Silber makes her Broadway debut as the goofy Sophie De Palma, whosenervousness is not relieved in the least by Callas. Silber's voice is not terribly convincing in the classicalpieces she tackles so I was never clear what we were supposed to think: is Sophie not that talented or isCallas simply uninterested in finding that out?
Garrett Sorenson has the best voice for this genre and yet is the weakest actor, playing the outgoing
Anthony Candolino as an eager puppy. And yet, Sorenson for all his lack of subtlety when acting has
charisma and presence and a friendly chemistry with Daly that works marvelously. His scene is the only
time we know exactly how talented he is and how Callas feels about it. Sorenson's musical climax is alsothe moment that sends a genuine thrill through the audience so it was no surprise to discover in thePlaybill that he's a rising star in the opera world.
The confusion returns with Sierra Boggess as Sharon Graham, a role knocked out of the park by Audra
McDonald in the original production. Boggess (who starred in The Little Mermaid ) doesn't convince as
an opera singer. So when she and Callas come to blows, it's unclear what director Stephen Wadsworth'sintent might be. It could be played many ways. Graham could be a genuine talent and thus Callas cuts herdown as a threat. Or Graham could be talented but only of a certain sort. She certainly wouldn't be thefirst to be told she wasn't right for a particular role like Lady Macbeth so Callas is simply being blunt. Thefireworks between the two just fizzle out. Jeremy Cohen has the fewest lines of the principals but creates
a warm, distinct personality as the pianist Manny Weinstock. He knows how to provide accompaniment
both as a musician and an actor.
Played broadly and musically uncertain, this Master Class  doesn't do full justice to the quiet charms of
McNally's play. But Daly never puts a foot wrong. No wonder she's a Tony winner and (I believe) the only
person to win an Emmy for a leading role in three different TV shows. When she's leaving the stage andalmost -- but not quite -- picks up an orange given to her as a sentimental gift, it's a brief but poignantmoment she captures easily. Callas doesn't want our pity but she always commands our attention,especially when played by Daly.
