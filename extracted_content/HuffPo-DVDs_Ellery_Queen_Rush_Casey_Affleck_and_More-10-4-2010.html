<p>the camera (to me!) and asking if we'd figured it out. The Ellery Queen mysteries were famous for that:
they provided all the clues upfront so that if you were clever and smart, you had just as good a chance offiguring out whodunit as the sleuth. Oddly, Ellery Queen has never been very successful outside of books
and short stories, where he's sold a reported 150 million copies and counting. A hit radio series lasted
quite a few years, but every TV incarnation was a flop, including this one, which lasted only one season.
Still, it's warmly remembered by fans as faithful to the spirit of the books, due in no small part to the
easy charm of Hutton and dependable character actor David Wayne as his dad. Dipping into the 22
episodes plus the TV movie pilot, it's very clear this was a warm-up for Murder She Wrote : a weekly
anthology of crime with a genial host and a raft of guest stars like Don Ameche, Ed McMahon, Sal Mineo,
Vincent Price, Joan Collins - you get the idea, the Love Boat, Fantasy Island  sort of gang. Pretty mild
stuff, in other words. A solid presentation, with modest extras like an interview with co-creator William
Link.
GET HIM TO THE GREEK  ($39.98 BluRay; $29.98 regular DVD) -- I do not get Russell Brand. But
this spin-off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall  played and played in movie theaters, obviously getting
great word of mouth. So when I was in the mood for silly fun and ready to give Brand another try, I knew
it was time for this comedy about a hapless record company employee (Jonah Hill) who must play nannywith a drinking and drugging rock star (Brand) and get him to a massively important concert on time.
When the movie began with a feeble rock parody (showing Brand in a pathetically "important" video
called "African Child") I knew I was in trouble. It did not get funnier as the rock star loosens up theemployee and the employee gives some heartfelt advice to the rock star about how to live his life andlessons are learned all around. By and large a time waster, some modest pleasure can be had on the
fringes, namely Sean Combs pretty amusing as a record company exec and Elizabeth Moss of Mad Men
sexily appealing as Hill's girlfriend. I dread Brand in the Arthur  remake more and more.
RUSH CLASSIC ALBUMS: 2112 AND MOVING PICTURES  ($14.98; Eagle Vision) -- It's a banner
year for Rush, what with the acclaimed documentary film Beyond The Lighted Stage  and this look at
their two most important albums. The Classic Albums series is a dependable one for fans of the actsinvolved and the formula is simple. A brief rundown of the band and their history is provided as a lead-into discuss one or two of their landmark albums, including fresh interviews with band members, a rock
critic or two, record label execs, producers and engineers and so on. If you're a fan of the band involved,
you can be sure the DVDs won't disappoint and most likely will dig up some info you didn't know before.(Finally, I know why that instrumental is called "YYZ.") Of course, it helps when the band is articulate

<p>and smart, as Rush is in spades and the commentary ranges from pressure from the record company to
breakdowns of individual tracks that reveal interesting little flourishes. Extras include extended
interviews, some new and classic performance footage that doubles the running time to two hours.
THE KILLER INSIDE ME  ($29.98 BluRay and $19.98 regular; IFC) -- Casey Affleck is obviously
flustered and surprised by the reaction to his performance art piece/mockumentary I'm Still Here  with
Joaquin Phoenix. But he should take comfort in the fact that if you want to talk about the movies of 2010
you need to see his directorial debut and you need to see his work on The Killer Inside Me,  a darker than
dark noir based on the Jim Thompson novel about a small-town sheriff who has to cover up one murder
with more murders and -- more distressingly -- finds he doesn't mind so very much. Affleck has a gift for
playing unpleasant, awkward characters and that's used to full effect here in scenes that areuncomfortably violent in a disturbing, unflinching manner that divided critics and audiences but made itone of the most talked about indie films of the year. It's the latest curve ball from the ever-restlessdirector Michael Winterbottom. Clearly not for the delicate, it's noir without the romanticism.
RICH MAN, POOR MAN  ($79.95; A&E) -- This is the miniseries that made a star of Nick Nolte AND a
star of the miniseries in general. The first 12 hour miniseries aired during the early months of 1976 andexploded in the ratings, ranking #2 for the year, right behind All In The Family.  Naturally, it was brought
back that fall for a second full season of 22 episodes, though Nick Nolte for obvious reasons was notinvolved. The Irwin Shaw novel was pure soap opera but the first edition had fun with it, to a degree,jamming the film full of actors like Ed Asner and Steve Allen and Robert Reed to join Nolte and Peter
Strauss in the epic tale of two brothers and their struggles from the end of World War II through the
Sixties. Though dated on every level (acting, dialogue, production values, etc.) the first miniseries isgenius compared to the Falcon Crest -level intrigues of season two. As with many A&E TV releases of
catalog titles, the video transfer is merely passable but certainly watchable despite wavering video andlines of age noticeable now and then. Fans will savor this release but the uninitiated will soon realize thisis no American equivalent to Upstairs Downstairs,  just trashy fun gussied up as art.

<p>LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE LAURIE BERKNER BAND!  ($16.99; Paramount) -- Wildly popular
fixture on Jack's Big Music Show,  Laurie Berkner pulls together some (but by no means all) of her videos
found there and elsewhere on Nick Jr and Noggin. You get 16 songs, intro'd by Moose and Zee with
encouragement to get up and dance along, as well as four more music videos. "Rocketship Run," "VictorVito," the hard to argue with "I'm Me and You're You" are some of the cuts included, all of which arecatchy and clever enough to keep parents engaged as well.
I'M GONNA EXPLODE  ($24.98; IFC) -- This "Mexican New Wave" drama follows two misfit teens
who pretend to run away from home but really camp out on the roof of the boy's residence while his
corrupt politician father and her easily distraught mother seek them out all over the country. Writer-
director Gerardo Naranjo has a pretty good eye and a certain talent for stringing out an entire film fromthis very modest premise, which barely develops more than I've described here. The boy is sexily
confused about his life of privilege and the girl is blunt and no-nonsense but we don't know much more
about them at the end than we did at the beginning and they certainly don't seem like star-crossed loversa la Romeo & Juliet. Late in the film, when they crash a birthday party and the boy is a boorish drunk, wereally start to question liking him at all. Maybe he is just a spoiled kid. Then the movie lurches into
unearned melodrama that's utterly out of step with the previous 95 minutes and they lost me for good.
Maybe Naranjo will develop more, but this is a part-boring, part-pretentious Godardian riff.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST</p>
<p>MY FAVORITE SPY  ($24.95; Olive Films/Paramount) -- Olive Films is an imprint that's been diving
into the Paramount vaults and rescuing the movies that the studio hasn't released for one reason or
another. After months of releases, it's safe to say that Olive is a dependable label. Their movies have noextras to speak of usually (something I personally don't care about, frankly). But the important point isthat they take good care to present a decent print. I wish the price point were lower but they're probably
doing what they can to eke out a profit on movies that are curiosities even to most film buffs. So if the
movie interests you, rest assured the quality should be fine. This Bob Hope vehicle will hopefully proveone of their best sellers. It's Hope in fine form as a cowardly comic dragooned into the spy business and(growllllllll) happily paired off with Hedy Lamarr. It's all handled ably by Norman Z. McLeod and ranks
as one of Hope's solo best. Also out is the Danny Kaye vehicle Knock On Wood , a so-so movie star biopic
Harlow , late period Bette Davis in Where Love Has Gone  and Kirk Douglas slumming it in the gloriously
tacky Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough.
TV ROUNDUP
TV sets come out in such a deluge, it's hard to keep up. Here's a rundown of the latest.
Petty Blue  ($19.99; Paramount/CMT) -- This won't interest non-fans, but for people who
love NASCAR and know the Petty family legacy, this Kevin Costner-narrated documentary
is a fine look at the men who literally made NASCAR from its earliest beginnings to itsheyday with Richard Petty and into the future.
The Lord Peter Wimsey Mysteries Set Two  ($49.99; Acorn) -- I do enjoy Lord Peter
Wimsey (the books are splendid) and Ian Carmichael is good in these three mysteries, all
of which are four-parters of 50 minutes each. But since we had this series in a complete (ifbulky and expensive) boxed set, it seems a step back to release them again in multi-set
offerings. Anyone who wanted to rent or buy Set One will surely want Set Two and vice
versa so why bother doing them alone?
CSI Tenth Season  ($79.99; Paramount) -- Marg Helgenberger becomes the de facto head of
the team even as Laurence Fishburne settles more into his role. You get the usual season-
long arc of a serial killer, crossover episodes with the other CSI 's (included in the extras)
and the high-tech wizardry that has about as much to do with most police work as Formula
500 racing does to your regular commute.
Legend Of The Seeker 2nd Season  ($45.99; ABC Studios) -- As so often happens, this show -
- based on the much darker Sword Of Truth novels by Terry Goodkind -- started to find its
way in season two just as the plug was pulled. A little more action, a little more freedom tohew closer to the books (rather than create standalone episodes) and a realization that this
was NOT Hercules  or Xena  all helped. Not great but fantasy pickings are slim on TV.
Magic & Bird: A Courtship Of Rivals  ($19.98; HBO) -- Earvin Johnson and Larry Bird
comprised one of the great rivalries in all of sports and that's lovingly captured in this look
at how the bitterest of on court enemies later become the closest of friends.
Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Year Eleven  ($59.98; Universal) -- Since this L&O has
always delved more into private lives, SVU has peaked much sooner than the original and
it's time to call it a day. Guest star arcs from Sharon Stone and Christine Lahti onlyemphasize that. Still, Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay give it dignity.</p>

these greatest hits compilations, both with an extra 20 minutes of sketches added in. It's
been a long time since they were originally released, still it's a shame the "extra" footagewasn't just included in the first place. But if you're a fan and didn't buy the earlier set, it'spretty much fool proof. If you did buy the earlier set and aren't certain if you should buy it
again, ask yourself this question: do you know all the words to The Hanukkah Song?" If so,
buy it.

59 FansWoody Allen fans might be interested in "My Favorite Spy." 
Allen has often cited Hope as a major influence. In movies like this one, along with Hope'sother "My Favorite" pictures ("Blonde," "Brunette" ) and "Monsieur Beaucaire, " you can see
it. With "Sleeper" and "Love and Death," especially , Allen paid homage to Hope's bragging
coward who fancies himself a ladies' man--even using some of Hope's physical mannerisms .
"Love and Death" is basically a Bob Hope movie for Russian Lit. majors. 
Haven't thought of the Ellery Queen show since I was a kid. I remember the mysteries being
cleverly worked out, but that the character of Queen was yes, "genial," yet not at allcompelling in the way that Levinson and Link's greatest creation, Columbo, was. The showwas more like an amusing braintease r, like a crossword puzzle or a game of chess (love that
DVD cover artwork), than a drama. I also recall John Hillerman, one of my favorite character
players, being his usual urbane self as Queen's arch-nemes is.
Thanks for reading and commenting . You're absolutely right about Woody Allen's
love for Bob Hope and how he modeled early roles on Hope's persona. It's also more
fun to watch My Favorite Spy than most recent Allen movies.
