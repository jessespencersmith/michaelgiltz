Hotel Rwanda . **1/, 
MGM,$26.98 
"Hotel Rwanda" bears the 
terrible weight of history. Not 
the history of genocide in 
Rwanda that it depicts, but the 
exact same nightmarish events 
taking place in the Sudan right 
now that unfairly make this fIlm 
seem so impotent. Don Cheadle 
is contr~lled and marvelous; the 
bountiful and sad extras include 
commentary from the real-life 
man the film is based on, Paul 
Rusesabagina. and a 
documentary, "Return to 
Rwanda." 
1be Bob Newhart 
Show: Season One **** Fox, $29.98 
Hi, Bob! One ofTV's sharpest, 
drollest comedies comes to 
DVD sans extras but with the 
marvelous ensemble (his sexy 
wife, annoying neighbor, 
wisecracking secretary and 
amusingly disturbed patients) 
that made it a classic. Also out: 
''All in the Family: Fourth 
Season" (Sony, $29.95) and 
"Sledge Hammer! Season Two" 
(Anchor Bay, $39.98). 
Morrissey: 
Who Put The 'M' 
In Manchester? *** BMG,$19.98 
The Wllde-at-heart u.K. Bad Education *** Sony, $26.96 
Most would say 
director Pedro 
Almodovar reached his 
peak with "serious" 
movies like ''All About 
My Mother." But his 
comic melodramas like 
"Women on the Verge 
ofaNervous 
Breakdown" are a lot 
more fun. "Bad" falls 
somewhere in . 
between, with its tale 
of a pedophile priest, a 
film-director suffering 
writer's block and an 
actor (Gael Garcia 
Bernal) desperate for a 
part. Extras include 
deleted scenes and 
audio commentary. 
singer Morrissey enjoyed a 
comeback, thariks to a strong 
new album and a live show, well足
captured in this concert film. 
New songs like "Irish Blood, 
English Heart" and "I Have 
Forgiven Jesus" stand alongside 
classics like "Shoplifters of the 
World Unite" quite nicely. Also 
out: the engrossing 
documentary "Dig!" (Palm, 
$24.98) about two rival bands足
the Brian Jonestown Massacre 
and the Dandy Warhols -with 
loads of extras. 
Ocean's 1\veIve 
*'/, 
Warner Bros., $27.95 
2001's "Ocean's Eleven" was a 
fluke: a fun trifle about robbing a 
casino that far surpassed the dull 
original. "Ocean's Twelve," 
unfortunately, is much more in 
the spirit of a Rat Pack movie: It 
looks like it was a lot more fun to 
make than it is to watch. 
Everyone is properly abashed: 
there are no extras to speak of.</p>
