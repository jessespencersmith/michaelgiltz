8/12/2004 09:35:00 AMKerry and Bush are in a tight race in Nevada, where Bush'sflip-flopping on a nuclear waste site may cost him the state. (Hepledged in the 2000 race to veto the proposed site in the Yuccamountains but went back on his word as soon as he got into office.Kerry has always been consistently opposed.)But what's annoying is this article about that race and how it mildlyoffers up in the middle that Bush is flat-out lying about Kerry's recordon the issue. Here's one example."'The Kerry-Edwards ticket was for Yucca Mountain before they wereagainst it, and Nevadans should not be fooled by election-yearpandering,' Nevada's Republican senator, John Ensign, said in astatement circulated by the Bush campaign."But Mr. Ensign himself, when pressed on a cable television programlast week, said of Mr. Kerry that 'on this one issue he's been betterthan George Bush, but that's on one issue.'"Why isn't this article about Bush distorting and lying about hisopponent's record? Isn't that worthy of mention any more? Or is itjust a given? There's a big difference between saying your way is forthe good of the country and their way leads to disaster and flat-outlying.
