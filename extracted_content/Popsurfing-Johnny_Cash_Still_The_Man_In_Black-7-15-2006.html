            <p>S AT U R D AY,  J U LY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 6Johnny Cash -- Still The Man (In Black)There's something about a great singer at the end of their life. Theirvoice is a shadow of what it used to be, but they know so much aboutsinging that they can plumb the depths of a song like never before. Thefrustrated ones can't get past the fact that their voice simply won't dowhat they tell it to anymore. The great ones know how to use what theyhave. Frank Sinatra. Maxine Sullivan. Ella Fitzgerald. Some of myfavorite songs by them came at the end of their careers. And nowJohnny Cash. His last album was almost painful to hear -- I think it'sbecause Cash felt that frustration, not to mention the death of his wifeand the sickness stealing over his body like a stain. But now on"American V: A Hundred Highways," he seems much more at peace.His voice still had its good days (a wonderfully strong take on therighteous standard "God's Gonna Cut You Down") and its bad ones (thewhispery frailness on the last song he ever wrote "Like The 309"). ButCash seems to have come to peace with his voice, not to mention thedeath staring him in the face. The result is singing that is transfixing,even when tackling the maudlin Gordon Lightfoot tune "If You CouldRead My Mind" (which sounds a LOT more compelling when Cashsings it) or Rod McKuen's "Love's Been Good To Me," which even Cashcan't rescue other than to offer a little much needed dignity. Plus, heand producer Rick Rubin avoid the formula they almost fell into ofincluding a wacky rock cover or two on every album just to keep thekids listening. Larry Gatlin's lovely "Help Me." Springsteen'scompelling "Further On Up The Road." Hank Williams' "On TheEvening Train." Seriously good songs sung with the fervor they deserve.This isn't bleak like "American IV" (which I also liked). It's elegiac,which is becoming my favorite adjective for describing the works of artthat calm and compel me at the same time. Wonderful stuff here.Listen.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
