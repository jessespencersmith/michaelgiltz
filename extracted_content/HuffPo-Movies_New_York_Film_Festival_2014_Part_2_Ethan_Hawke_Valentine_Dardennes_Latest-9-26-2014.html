They're in luck; the early reviews are raves. And the critic screenings are in overdrive withthree or four movies playing during the day for over a week now. So there's a lot to catch up on and a lot to see.Here are two very good documentaries and two dramas. Only one may be truly great at first blush but they're allworthwhile in one way or another.THE LOOK OF SILENCE *** 1/2Director Joshua Oppenheimer's Oscar-nominated film The Act Of Killing is one of the brashest, strangest,downright surreal films of recent years. It looks at the bizarre and unsettling facts of Indonesia, where undercover of the fight against communism a massive genocide took place in the 1960s. The people who committed itare still in power, still living among the survivors of the people they brutally slaughtered. The PBS series POV isairing the film on October 6 and it's not to be missed. What makes the film so strange? Well, Oppenheimer metwith the people who committed these crimes against humanity and somehow got them to reenact theirmurderous actions...in the style of various movie genres. This doesn't begin to accurately capture the rare moodof the film, which is funny and horrifying. It's no surprise that Errol Morris and Werner Herzog championed it;they love breaking the rules in their documentaries as well.Now comes a companion piece, The Look Of Silence. It is in many ways the polar opposite of the first. Nogimmicks, no tricks, no high concept framing to coax people into documenting their own crimes. It simply showsthe brother of one man who was slaughtered quietly talking to and sometimes confronting the many, manypeople in power who are responsible for murder.One of my (many) pet peeves is describing this actor or that director as "brave." There's nothing brave aboutplaying a part on stage or in a movie, no matter how audacious. Save "brave" for people who genuinely risk theirlives for others, like cops and firemen and soldiers and the like. But genuine courage is the only way to describethe father who takes center stage in this work. Oppenheimer's earlier film documented who killed his brother andhow. In this movie, the man literally risks his life to confront the people -- including an uncle -- who did this.The title comes from the way he can ask a question and then simply sit and stare as their absurd, insulting,petty, dismissive or disingenuous answers fall to the ground, unworthy of comment. Some crumple under hisquiet bearing of witness; others literally threaten his life. A young woman hears her elderly father describedrinking the blood of the people he slaughtered (in order to not go crazy, others explain, in a superstitiousresponse to the evil they were perpetrating). She begs forgiveness. Others stonily refuse to admit the obvious.</p>

It's not just a brave act; it's also a genuine work of art. Surely at thebeginning of every audience Q&A, at every press conference, the first question will be: has this man beenkilled? One of the best films of the year, The Look Of Silence is a startlingly different but just as potentcompanion piece to one of the best documentaries in a long time.Here's the trailer for The Act Of Killing, which airs on PBS October 6.SEYMOUR: AN INTRODUCTION ***Ethan Hawke is becoming rather annoying. He's been an acclaimed actor on stage and screen for many years.He's written novels. Then he took up journalism and delivered a great profile of Kris Kristofferson for RollingStone. Now he's starring in Boyhood, one of the most acclaimed films of the year and a genuine indie hit. To topit off, he's making his debut as a documentary filmmaker with this sweet valentine to Seymour Bernstein, abeloved music teacher.They met at a dinner party a few years ago with Hawke immediately opening up about his almost crippling stagefright and self-doubts about whether what he did had any worth. Bernstein was an ideal sounding board: he'dquit his brilliant public career as a pianist and devoted himself to teaching and composing.Bernstein's philosophy is that practice of any craft, any talent, makes you better at your craft and better as aperson. He turned his back on the treadmill of fame and perhaps feels it's mostly destructive. But fear is ok,even essential. Doubt is ok. And the doing of it, the working at your talent is essential. So indeed, is creating andnot just recreating. (A pianist who plays a piece by Bach is "recreating." A pianist who composes his own work is"creating." One is not worthier than the other but Bernstein feels strongly that artists should create.Hawke, as a writer and director and producer sometimes beleaguered for having the temerity to do so (muchlike james Franco is today) surely was sympathetic to this. Plus Bernstein was so delightful, so full of life, sohappy in his calling as a teacher. Why didn't someone make a movie about him? Why indeed?So Hawke did. The film is quietly bold. It's a profile of Bernstein. But it also documents his philosophy of life andHawke's struggles are a modest subplot. This makes it a little shaggy, especially when it climaxes with whatshould be the cheap sentimentality of a public performance: Bernstein gives a benefit concert for the theatercompany Hawke helped found. But this becomes the film's masterstroke since Hawke intercuts footage ofBernstein practicing the piece and performing the piece, symbolizing the man's approach to life with one boldstroke.Not since To Be And To Have has a teacher been shown in such a disarming way; you want to immediately sitin on one of Bernstein's classes. Or at least buy some of his music. (A brief search turned up nothing officially inprint.) Hopefully a soundtrack won't be far behind this charming work.EDEN ** 1/2Film festivals can play a vital role for some filmmakers. They may not achieve international success at first. Buta festival that believes in a talent can keep championing their work, telling critics to pay attention. I was notenamored with Mia Hansen-Love's debut Father Of My Children. So I skipped her similar seeming secondfeature. But here she is again with a new movie. It's radically different in nature from her earlier work and thebuzz is good so here I am.Indeed, Eden is very different from her small-scale dramas, though it surely is linked in theme and other subtlerways. On the surface, it's about raves and DJs, tracing the career of one talented young artist from fan to deejayto a name big enough to travel the world a bit and rub shoulders with the likes of Daft Punk. it's not about fame</p>

Eden rather interestingly shows passion -- inthis case, for garage music -- turning into a job. And a young man slowly realizes that the joy of his youth isn'tgoing to be enough to sustain him for the rest of his life. What next?It roams over many years but has a light touch. Since the film isn't truly interested in deejays as an art form, wedon't spend much time at all learning how they do what they do, to say the least. Our hero Paul (the handsomeFelix de Givry) is seen more often being hapless in love than working at his craft. (Seymour would havesomething to say about that.) The rave scenes are pretty but never quite get under your skin; you can seepeople reacting to the music and the deejays dancing in ecstasy but it's all at a slight remove. Perhaps becausethey know eventually the party will end.That remove is probably the film's biggest strength. They're not making a grand statement about raves, howeven the most rebellious art forms become co-opted. They're not examining the scourge of drugs. They're notromanticizing or criticizing youthful passion. Eden simply watches life happen; it just so happens that in this caselife is often at a rave or disco.The result is certainly meandering. And surely it's not a good thing that after more than two hours of film timeand years of story we barely have a sense of Paul's relationship with his artistic partner in deejaying. But deGivry is very compelling, along with Roman Kolinka as an artist friend, and something here has stayed with me alittle. Hansen-Love isn't there yet. But the faith shown in her by festivals like NYFF might pay off yet.TWO DAYS, ONE NIGHT ** 1/2The new film by the Dardenne brothers is a disappointment. So often, their movies rank among the best of theyear and have for nearly 20 years. They've made seven feature films beginning in 1996 and five of them havebeen great, often really great. Only The Silence of Lorna from 2008 felt like a genuine misfire, with its hokey plotcontrivance. They got back on track with 2011's The Kid With A Bike, a movie that seemed to push theirsignature style into modest new territory with good effect.Two Days, One Night however is a noble failure, a step backward as it seems to recapitulate what they've donebefore with more elan. Still, it's a timely tale with a strong hook and their fans will surely not feel they've wastedtheir time by checking it out. Marion Cotillard stars as a woman who has fallen into a serious depression and isnow recovered. Or is that recovering? We stay right on top with Sandra as her story quickly reveals itself. She'sbeen on leave from work but the owner of the company forced her coworkers to vote: did they want Sandra toget her job back or receive their annual bonus. The company couldn't afford to do both. After a vote heavilyweighted against Sandra, the owner is forced to agree to a new vote. Sandra has the weekend to go visit eachof her 16 coworkers and plead for her job... and in the process ask them to give up a 1000 euro bonus.Two Days, One Night has the usual immediacy of a Dardenne film, movies where the camera is usually perchedon the shoulder of the protagonist and never leaves their side. But this film soon feels too episodic, too neatlystructured in a way. Each coworker has their own psychodrama on display: one is worried about voting againstwhat the owners want because he's on a limited contract, another has been wracked with guilt over votingagainst Sandra and begs her forgiveness, yet another has a troubled marriage, many try to avoid her and ofcourse they can all use (sometimes desperately) that 1000 euros.Quickly, the meetings between Sandra and her coworkers become too schematic. A happy scene of acceptanceis invariably followed by one of rejection or indifference; if one features a poor family, another is sure to feature afamily using the bonus for luxuries like a back porch and so on.Some late twists feel cheap and should have bigger ramifications; others give the tale a much-neededsubstance. No movie by the Dardennes could be without worth and Cotillard is always a pleasure to watch. Butthis is a minor entry in their filmography and hopefully just a stumble on the way to the next great work by one of</p>
