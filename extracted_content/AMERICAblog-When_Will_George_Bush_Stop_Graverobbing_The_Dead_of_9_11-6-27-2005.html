6/27/2005 05:34:00 PMNo, President Bush, we haven't forgotten. Your attack dog KarlRove came to New York City and the sacred ground of 9-11 andmade a nasty, partisan political speech and he used thatnational tragedy to do it. Rove very directly made a comparisonbetween conservatives and liberals, but put that aside.Whether you believe Bush was using Rove to attack a smallgroup of Americans he thinks are misguided or the 50 millionAmericans who didn't vote for him or the vast majority ofAmericans who now realize he lied about Iraq, using the deadof 9-11 to try and beef up your poll numbers is reprehensibleand wrong.No one should use the dead of 9-11 to try and further theirpartisan political agenda. Whomever Bush wants to pretendthat screed was directed at, he used the innocent victims of9-11 to do it.Of course Bush hasn't apologized. He's abused the tragedy of9-11 repeatedly. Bush used the carnage of 9-11 in a politicalad. He showed the corpses of loved ones being pulled from therubble of the World Trade Center to try and score a few extravotes. Widows and children were put through the trauma of notknowing whether the ad might be showing their husband orwife, their brother or sister, their son or daughter beingremoved from that scene of horror. And Bush didn't care. Theoutcry was so immediate and intense over his crass use of anational tragedy for partisan political purposes that the addidn't run. But Bush never apologized. In fact, he defended itto the hilt.And Bush's Republicans have graverobbed the innocent dead of9-11 again and again to push every pet project of theirs underthe sun, from oil drilling in Alaska to the flag-burningamendment. The bereaved family members have begged andpleaded and prayed for everyone to stop politicizing their lovedones and making hay out of their pain and suffering. AndGeorge Bush has turned his back on them again and again.The entire country was united behind our president after 9-11and everyone, to put it bluntly, wanted revenge. George Bushhas now had almost four years to hunt down and kill OsamaBin Laden and he has failed miserably. And because he's tooweak to attack Bin Laden, Bush has resorted to attackingAmericans. Because he's too weak to divide and conquer AlQueda, Bush is trying to divide and conquer America.When will George Bush stop graverobbing the dead of 9-11?Never.
