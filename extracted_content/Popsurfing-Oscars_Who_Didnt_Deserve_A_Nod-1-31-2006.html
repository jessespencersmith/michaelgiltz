            <p>T U E S D AY,  J A N U A RY  3 1 ,  2 0 0 6Oscars: Who Didn't Deserve A NodEveryone talks about the people who were snubbed, but they rarelyfollow that up by detailing which nominations should be removed tomake room for their choice. So here's a rundown of which nominationswere lazy, misguided or just plain wrong. Mind you, many of theseactors and other talent are terrific and have done great work. This justshouldn't have been their year. (And this isn't just my personal taste --I didn't like "Crash" but I'm not quibbling with that; ditto KeiraKnightley in "Pride & Prejudice, which I didn't like but was acommercial and critical success. I'm quibbling with nominations evenAcademy voters probably don't feel strongly about. These are the onesthey can't justify.)BEST PICTURE: Take back "Munich."BEST DIRECTOR: Take back "Steven Spielberg"BEST ACTRESS: Take back Judi Dench in "Mrs. Henderson Presentsand Charlize Theron in "North Country"ART DIRECTION: Take back "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"COSTUME DESIGN: Take back "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"and "Mrs. Henderson Presents"DOCUMENTARY: Take back "March of the Penguins" (It's NOT adocumentary!)SCORE: Take back "Munich" (I love John Williams but it's a weak,cliched score)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Poorly reviewed and poorly received commercially, I think it was just alazy, rote nomination -- not a comment on the film (which I didn't like)but again, just taking them to task for auto pilot.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
