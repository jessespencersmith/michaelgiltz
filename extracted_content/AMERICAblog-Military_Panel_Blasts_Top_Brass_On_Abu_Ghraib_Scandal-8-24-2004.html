8/24/2004 02:35:00 AMA major independent panel set up by Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld implicitly blasts him and blames "leadership failures at thehighest levels of the Pentagon, Joint Chiefs of Staff and militarycommand in Iraq" for the shameful scandal in which our militaryengaged in widespread torture, rape and even murder of prisonersthat in most cases were unimportant low-level combatants or eveninnocent civilians.Now if they'd included the Commander in Chief as well, we couldchime in. And where are those videos of rape? As Commander inChief, why hasn't Bush demanded to see those videos of war crimes(which is exactly what rape is)? Doesn't he care?
