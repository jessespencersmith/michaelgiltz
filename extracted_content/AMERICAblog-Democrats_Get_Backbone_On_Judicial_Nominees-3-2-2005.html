3/02/2005 06:14:00 PMCan you imagine the Democrats nominating a lifelong lobbyistfor Planned Parenthood to be a judge in the US Court ofAppeals? The mere idea is absurd. But Bush nominated alifelong lobbyist for the mining and ranching industries to be ajudge in the very Circuit where he would be dealing with somany cases that affect those industries. William G. Myers IIIwas blocked by the Dems -- quite rightly -- and was one of tenjudicial nominations (about 5%) that didn't get approved. A95% approval seems pretty darn high but the Republicans liketo pretend that's somehow obstructionist. Ever heard anyonesuggest that if you don't do exactly what they want everysingle time then YOU"RE the problem?Well, the Republicans -- before launching the nuclear option ofending the long Senatorial history of fillibusters -- decided toreach out the olive branch. How? By simply renominating thesame extremist Myers to the same job? What could be morereasonable? Sure, Myers was a senior lawyer in the InteriorDepartment where he drafted rulings that a judge later saidperverted the clear mandate of a federal law. Sure he met withmine owners 127 times but refused to meet with Indian tribeseven once. But God help us, the Dems -- perhaps emboldenedby their success in countering the lies Bush pushed on SocialSecurity -- showed backbone.The New York Times quotes the Senators who grilled -- and Ido mean grilled Myers:"The most anti-environmental candidate for the bench I haveseen in 37 years in the Senate," Senator Patrick J. Leahy ofVermont, the committee's ranking Democrat, said, according tothe NYT. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York,said, "Your record screams 'passionate advocate' and it doesn'teven whisper 'impartial judge.' "USA Today also weighs in with a good story, reminding us thatthe Senate approved 214 of Bush's judicial nominees andblocked 10. Every time one of them tries to throw that absurd"obstructionist" charge at the Dems, throw those figures backat them. 96% approval? How much more accomodating dothey expect the Dems to be?As for the nuclear option of ending fillibusters, my God, is it toomuch to ask that 60 Senators are willing to back a SupremeCourt Justice? I wouldn't think asking they get 75 of theSenators to support them would be asking too much frankly(that 's about what it was in the early 70s till they changed therules). What would be the result? Moderate, mainstreamjustices that BOTH parties could approve of. God forbid.
