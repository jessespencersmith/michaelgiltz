"I'd much rather play to 50,000 people
than 1,000!" says Bass, who plays Corny
Collins, perkv and popular dance-show
host in 1962 Baltimore, stafting Tuesday.
"In a theater, you can see everyone!
"It is like doing a live TV show," adds
the 28-year-old Mississippi native who
shot to fame as one of the members of the
massively successful group, who, at their
peak, rivaled Backstreet Boys for squeal-
ing fans and launched the careers of Jus-
til Timberlerke, Joey Fatone md the rest
"Everything has to be perfectly il-sync,"
Bass says, smiling at the pun, "I hate to
use that pbrase. But lon stagel you don'twant to miss your rue "
Even though Bass made
headlines by coming out
last year, among the
'N Sync guys, it's Fatone
who's the real musical-
theaterbuff Heevenbeat
Bass to Broadway by appear-
ing in "Rent" and "Uttle Shop of
Honors "
Like other out pop stars, Bass says the
fears that fans - especially young female
fans - would grow disenchanted with
him was wildly off-base
"When I came out, my female fan baseexploded," says Bass. He'll be testing that
again next yeil by developing a reality
show for the gay cable chamel Logo (md,
he notes, hopefully MTV; both networks
are omed by Viacom)
Pass says he fell in love with
perfoming as a kid, when he
appeared in his church choir,
in Attache (the "show choir"
that was a huge part of his ad-
olescence) and high school
productions of "West Side
StorJ/ and "Bye Bye Birdie"
before dropping out his sopho-
more year to join 'N Symc
In small-town Clinton, Miss ,
"you either played football or you per-
formed in Attache," says Bass, who notes
that one strength of the show choir was
that kids needed to act like adults and
train with utter professiona-tism."That's where I leamed the discipline
I needed to do 'Hairspray,'" says Bass,
whose autobiography, "Out of Sync," will
be published this October. He explains
that the group had constant rehearsals, a
band, their om stage crew md a reper-
toire that ranged from Broadway classics
to Van Halen; they gave two amual recit-
als and competed nationally.
It underscored a passion for the stage
that began even eulier for him
"The flrst time I was ever on stage, it
was in the third grade," says Bass, friendly
and confldent despite being dubbed "The
Shy One" during'N Sync's heyday.
"I played Smokey the Bear I remember
being so happy that I'd memorized all my
Iines; I knew the entire script, and I was so
proud And I hadabear costume Iwas so
cute!" he insists drolly. "An6, 1-or", tot
Halloween, too " a</p>

he latest revival of "Grease"
has a secret weapon - and
it isn't the stunt casting of
the leads, Max Crumm (as
revival of "Grease" closed on Broad-
way but Marshall pooh-poohs the
idea that this revival is too soon
"I look at the audience md
you see a lot of families md a
lot of kids who weren't bom
when the last revival came
out," she says "Itwould be
like a dance company not do-
ing'The Nutcracken"'
She says opening the same
weekend as "High School Musical 2"
airs on the Disney Channel - that's the se-
quel to the massively popular TV movie -
feels right, too
'nvhen they were fllming 'High School
Musical,' I heard that they were catling itDanny) and Laura Osnes (as
Sandy), via the recent NBC reali-
ly show "Grease: You're the One
That I Want."
For the first time ever on Broaowav.
''Grease' will inctude four now-iconii sones
from I he smash I 978 movie that weren't
in eiLher rhe original producrion during
the I 970s or ihe successful revival that ran
in the early '90s Director and choreogra-
pher Katrueen Marshall (a Tony wimer,
most recently for her revival of "The pajama
Game") says that's actually one of the rea-
sons she signed on to this show.
"Now Sandy says, 'Tell me about it, stud,,
dnd Darny finally gets to sing: 'I got chills,
they're multiplyin'," says Marshall about
the climax of the show with "You're the One
That IWant '
.. rThat No. I smash hit from summer'78 ap-
pears along wirh "Sandy." "Hopelessly De-
voted to You" and the new opene4 "Grease
Is the Word " (ronically, "Grease" spillover
is everJryhere: Frankie VaIIi, who sang the
title song, has a Tony-winning life story on
vlew in the current smash "Jersey Boys,"
and Olivia Neu.ton-John's musical followun
to "Grease." 'Xanadu," is also packing them
in, with tongue firmly nestled in cheek )
It has been almost a decade since the last
'Grease 3, " says Marshall (there
was, of course, the ill-fated 1982
sequel "Grease 2") "It's another
high-school rommce with peo-
ple from different groups, the
jocks and the brains."
As for the realify show that
played on TV this winter and
gave the show its leads, "Grease
You're the One That I Want" onlv
reached about 7 million viewers a
week But most episodes scored higher
than the Tony Awards in the ratings. Still, it
was a risk of tainting the actors as not pros
In the U.K., theypulled the same tactic and
the revival that recently opened in the WestEnd got withering reviews
"Some people will come in with a precon-
ceived notion about the show and a precon-
ceived notion of how our leads were cast,"
says Marshall, who has also done acclaimed
work on 'Vonderful Town," "Follies" and
"Kiss Me Kate " "And if they decide to be
negative, they can be "
But all those eager new kids performing
all the songs people associate with the mov-
ie and show are her biggest plus
"We've got 14 people making their Broad-
way debut," says Marshall "We've got a re-
ally fresh, young exciting cast They've got a
spirit and energy you kind of can't fake You
can't fake freshness " a.i.w
