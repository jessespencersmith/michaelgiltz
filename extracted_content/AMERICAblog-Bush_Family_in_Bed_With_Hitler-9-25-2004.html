9/25/2004 02:29:00 AMThe Guardian in London has a nice, juicy story about Dubya'sgrandfather Prescott Bush and how he had business dealings with theNazis -- including the businessman that literally funded Hitler's rise topower -- and continued with those business dealings even AFTERPearl Harbor. No wonder Bush doesn't think it's a big deal Cheney didbusiness with Iraq through Halliburton even though it was against USlaw.The allegations have been around for a while but now numerousdocuments recently declassified have buttressed the case. PrescottBush's actions were so bad that assets of the company he served as adirector on were seized by the US government..."...in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act [and] has led morethan 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought inGermany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers atAuschwitz and to a hum of pre-election controversy."That's right. Bush is being sued by survivors of Auschwitz(!)because they say his family profited from the death camps. TheGuardian also suggests that one reason Bush backtracked onClinton's support of the World Court was because his family could bedragged in front of it!"...the new documents, many of which were only declassified lastyear, show that even after America had entered the war and whenthere was already significant information about the Nazis' plans andpolicies, [Prescott Bush] worked for and profited from companiesclosely involved with the very German businesses that financedHitler's rise to power. It has also been suggested that the money hemade from these dealings helped to establish the Bush family fortuneand set up its political dynasty."If we wrote it as fiction, you'd say it was crazy and over-the-top --Bush's family doing business with the Nazis even AFTER PearlHarbor? No one is that cynical and cruel.
