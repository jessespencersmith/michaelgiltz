            <p>DVDs:  Is  Tom  Hanks  the  Most  Popular
Star  of  All  Time?
A final batch of new and upcoming releases before choosing the best DVDs and BluRays
of 2013. Here goes....
BIG  25TH  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION($19.99 BluRay/DVD; FOX) -- Is Tom Hanksthe most popular actor in history? Look at hislist of movies and their remarkable box officesuccess on IMDB or The Numbers. You canslice the numbers a lot of ways. And of courseyou can't really compare actors from the lastfew decades with actors from the studio heyday.Clark Gable. Bette Davis. Humphrey Bogart. Alot of stars had lengthy careers with many boxoffice hits -- if we could look at ticket sales, wecould start to better compare different eras,though again you'd keep in mind that thepopulation has exploded. So box office is arough estimate, sure, even if you adjust forinflation (which I don't). But by some estimatesHanks has the all-time worldwide box office
total. $8.2 billion and counting. Daniel Radcliffe is #2 with $6.5 billion, thanks to onefranchise of course. (Give Robert Downey Jr. a few years and a few more   Iron
Man/Avengers  and he'll be #1. Harrison Ford used to have bragging rights thanks to both
Star  Wars  and Indiana  Jones . No, don't bring up Hugo Weaving; he's not the leading
man/main draw in Matrix  and LOTR.  Ditto Ian McKellen.) But here's why I think Hanks
is unquestionably one of the most durable and appealing stars of all time and arguably the
most popular. He's starred in 18 films that have grossed more than $100 million at the
North American box office, beginning with Big  -- just out in a 25th anniversary edition
and as delightful as ever -- right up to Captain  Phillips  from this summer. His new movie,
Saving  Mr.  Banks,  might possibly be his 19th one to do it. That's 25 years of remarkable
consistency; 25 years of making critical and commercially successful films and only five of
them come from a franchise ( Toy  Story  and the Da  Vinci  movies). Tom Cruise has 15 to
17 movies that have grossed more than $100 million in North America, depending on howyou score cameos and small supporting roles in movies like Austin  Powers  InGoldmember  and Tropic  Thunder  (I wouldn't count either, just as I don't count Hanks
doing minor voice work on The  Simpsons  Movie. ) In this era where movies enjoy $100
million opening weekends, this record will surely fall someday, as will his perch atop theall-time list. But what an amazing run. He achieved it with comedies and dramas, periodpieces and contemporary romances, serious Oscar contenders and popcorn fare. He's doneit for 25 years, along with success as a producer (multiple TV projects like Band  OfBrothers ) and directing himself. And he doesn't do it by playing safe: recent films include
Cloud  Atlas,  Larry  Crowne,  the black war comedy Charlie  Wilson's  War,  The  Ladykillers,
The  Bonfire  Of  The  Vanities  and Joe  Versus  The  Volcano  (a personal favorite and a career

<p>high for Meg Ryan.) Those are all films that didn't work commercially and got mixed
reviews. But they're just as important to his success as his hits, since Hanks doesn't have aformula.
Surely Jimmy Stewart was a durable star in his era, breaking through in 1938 and
gracefully bowing out of the big screen more than 30 years later. Hanks -- often called theJimmy Stewart of our day -- is still firing on all cylinders and could keep going for anotherdecade or two as a leading man without breaking a sweat. If you're having a debate on the
most popular/most enduring/most successful movie star of all time, Tom Hanks has to be
in the mix.
He broke through with Splash  and made Bachelor  Party  far funnier than it deserved to
be. But it was Big  that made Hanks an Oscar-nominated star of the first order. It was the
first time a female director helmed a $100 million grossing movie and all credit to Penny
Marshall, who like Hanks made the leap from TV. It's his best feature, by far, and still a
key role in his career. Playing a boy trapped in a man's body, Hanks has a goofy nature, a
sweet disposition and a safe sexiness that would serve him well in the decades to come. If
you want to know why Hanks deserves such acclaim and the laurel of "most popular
movie star of all time," start right here.

Like Tom
Hanks, MattDamon hasproven a veryinterestingmovie star,an actor whopopularized
one of the most successful and smart franchisesin recent memory (the Bourne films, which
unquestionably served as the template for the revitalized James Bond franchise as well).But he's also consistently chosen very interesting projects mixed in with the blockbusterhopefuls that keep him bankable. Case in point was signing on to this dystopian sci-fimovie with Damon trapped in a future where the 1% live literally in the clouds and therest of us scrounge for survival on the scorched surface of the earth. Damon ain't havingthat. It's not as successful as Neill Blomkamp's District  9  and poor Jodie Foster just looks
silly spouting French (so we know she's evil?) in space. But Damon grounds Elysiumnicely until the action takes over and obliterates any actual drama.
Ken Loach is deservedly known as a committed director of politically committed works,</p>
<p>movies that embody his ideals and hopes for social justice by telling tales like the brilliant
The  Wind  That  Shakes  The  Barley  (a look at the inexorable cycle of violence), Bread  And
Roses  (a look at Latina maids trying to organize) and so on. But this obscures his overall
desire to tell tales, to portray people in all their complicated glory, whether it's the
alcoholic romantic of My  Name  Is  Joe , the mess of a mother in Ladybird,  Ladybird  or
sports-centric movies like the very amusing Looking  For  Eric.  This is all embodied in The
Angels'  Share,  which depicts a man who just avoids prison, makes lots of mistakes but
vows to make a better life for his newborn son and thinks whiskey might just be the
answer. The people are flawed, funny, hapless and sweet. Loach never judges or excuses
these characters and this comic drama is as good an introduction to any for Loach the
filmmaker as opposed to Loach the activist, the role that has dominated his perception for
too long.
Kick-Ass was a surprisingly successful black comedy that got a lot of mileage out of
showing little kids creating genuine mayhem a la vigilante super heroes. It was always an
oddball project but Nicolas Cage had great fun riffing on the TV Batman  and Aaron
Taylor-Johnson is a genuine talent. They should have left well enough alone because the
lucky mix of surprise and violence doesn't gel in Kick-Ass  2 , the sequel that no one was
asking for.
Speaking of unexpected humor, critics and audiences seemed bemused by this over-the-
top drama and found it "laughable," not apparently realizing that director NicolasWinding Refn is clearly in on the joke and Only  God  Forgives  is supposed  to be funny in a
Lynchian vein. Ryan Gosling is a drug-smuggler with a mother of Oedipal greatnessthanks to Kristin Scott-Thomas who wants him to kill, kill, kill to avenge his brother. Letthe reappraisal and cult status begin now. Great title by the way.
Casey Affleck needs a big success to turn him into a bankable star. Meanwhile, he just
keeps on making quirky, dark very satisfying indie films like Ain't  Them  Bodies  Saints,  an
offbeat crime drama with Affleck escaped from jail and determined to reunite with hislove Rooney Mara. Can you blame him? Add this to his distinctive resume that includesthe brutal The  Killer  Inside  Me,  Gerry,  The  Last  Kiss  and other off-the-beaten-track
movies. Too bad he wasn't working when noir ruled.
I just saw a brilliant live production of Julius  Caesar  with an all-female cast and set in a
prison. So I am definitely primed for this Taviani Brothers movie which features an all-
male cast doing Julius Caesar in a prison, with performing the play having unexpectedrepercussions. Unlike the female version, Caesar  Must  Die  has a lot more drama beyond
what Shakespeare wrote. It's one of the best reviewed movies of the year and is Italy'snominee for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars.
Speaking of acclaim The  Hunt  has it in spades. It's directed by the fascinating talent
Thomas Vinterberg, who has been one to watch since Festen  burst onto the international
scene. Mads Mikkelsen is a quiet school teacher whose life is dramatically upended when
he's accused of molesting a student. Here we see with devastating accuracy how even anaccusation can destroy someone forever. Mikkelsen won the Best Actor Award at Cannesand like Caesar  Must  Die,  it is the Danish entry for Best Foreign Film.
Frances  Ha  is the latest collaboration between director Noah Baumbach and his wife/co-
screenwriter Greta Gerwig, who also starred in Bambauch's Greenberg. What this film
captures very well is the friendship between two women. There's no man to fight over and
any jealousy is the very natural jealousy of two people where one is getting ahead and the
other is trying to figure out her life, not the cattiness that dominate so many films about
women. It feels natural, observant and real, with moments of awkward humor andgenuine sadness and a general air of spontaneity that is refreshing. No wonder it's beingreleased by Criterion, which also offers a raft of extras ranging from Sarah Polley talkingwith Gerwig to Baumbach talking with the many talented behind the scenes artists whoworked on the filme. This one will age well.
Lea Seydoux has received more attention than ever for her work on Blue Is The Warmest
Color. But she's clearly no flash in the pan, with numerous acclaimed films gaining</p>
<p>international recognition. Switzerland even submitted Sister  as its entry for Best Foreign
Film last year and Seydoux is a key reason why. She stars in this initially amusing but
ultimately piercing film about a little boy who tries to win his sister's affection by stealingfrom rich guests staying at the ski lodge they live near. This is why God made DVDs, soyou can catch up with an actor's body of work after discovering them.
MARTIN  SCORSESE'S  WORLD  CINEMA  PROJECT  ($124.95
BluRay/DVD -- Martin Scorsese is second to none when it comes to
film preservation and a serious push to introducing audiences to all
sorts of films, from silent shorts to the great works of cinema from
around the world. Hence his World Cinema Project, which doesjust that for international films. Now he's working with Criterion tomake sure these restored movies reach as many people as possible.
This first of what will hopefully be many volumes, includes six
films from 1936 to 1981, from Senegal to South Korea. They're all
presented with impeccable care, including new introductions from Scorsese explaining
why these movies are important to him personally and cinema in general. You know all
rage for online studies via university? Your education in world cinema's lesser known
offerings has just begun and you'll enjoy it a lot more than that intro to physics.
THE  LITTLE  MERMAID  DIAMONDEDITION  ($29.99 BluRay/DVD; Disney) -- You
can mark Disney's renaissance from The Fox and
the Hound (when they started to show signs of life)or The Great Mouse Detective (my personal pickfor an exclamation of "they're back!"). But everyoneagrees and rightly so that The  Little  Mermaid  is the
first out of the park masterpiece of its secondgolden age and a key film in the overall renaissanceof animation that extended throughout Hollywoodand the world. Reason number one is that it boastsa score by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, whobecame one of the all-time great composers ofmusicals. But it's also the rich animation, terrificvoice work and a script that is smart and modern
without ever including dated contemporary slang (something Dreamworks Animationshould have learned a long time ago). It's been packaged and repackaged many times butDisney always presents their film library with care. If you don't own it, don't hesitate. Ifyou have a recent version, you probably don't need to bother. But if you watch it again, itwon't take more than a few minutes to realize we may be coming up on its 25thanniversary but this looks as good as ever.</p>
<p>SPEAK  THE  MUSIC  ($24.99 DVD; First Run Features)
MORE  THAN  HONEY  ($329.95 DVD out December 24; Kino Lorber)
RUSSIAN  ARK  ($29.99 DVD; Kino Lorber)
MEN  AT  LUNCH  ($24.95 DVD; First Run Features) -- Four documentaries worth
tackling and gifting to those who prefer their movies with a little fact rather than fiction.
Speak  The  Music  is an engaging, fascinating look at Robert Mann, a legend in the classical
music world and the founder of the Juilliard String Quartet. Now 93 years old, he's stillfiery and fun, coaching the brightest new talents on violin while sharing his stories from arich and varied career, from his childhood to the vagaries of life in a string quartet. (Itain't all wine and roses; in fact, it's rarely wine and roses.) Essential for fans of classicalmusic.
More  Than  Honey  is an in-depth look at the bee and why it's disappearing. Narrated by
John Hurt, this is a visually stunning and non-polemical look at a vexing, indeed
frightening phenomenon in nature.
Russian  Ark  is a grand stunt of a film, a tour through the Hermitage in Russia done in
one long take. It shouldn't work and you wouldn't want anyone else to do anything like it
again, but it maintains a tension amidst the beauty and splendor of what's on display,combined with actors and set pieces that take us through history as well as the museum.
One of a kind, truly.
Finally, there's Men  At  Lunch.  I live in Long Island City, Queens, and there's a trunk that
drives around sporting a huge sculpture depicting that famous photograph depicting
construction workers on break high on a beam of the partially built Rockefeller Center. SoI'm as primed for anyone to see this new documentary about exactly who those guys wereand how the photo was taken and what's happened to them since. Nothing earth-shaking,but an amusing side journey nonetheless.</p>
<p>JUSTIFIED  FOURTH  SEASON  ($65.99 BluRay; Sony)
THE  PALLISERS  40TH  ANNIVERSARY  EDITION  ($99.99 DVD; Acorn) -- The late
Elmore Leonard had the intense pleasure of seeing one of his works turned into the very
fun TV series Justified. Starring Timothy Olyphant, it captures Leonard's distinctive blendof violence, offbeat humor and memorable characters better than anyone else. They stillhaven't matched the peak of Season Two but it's definitely fun and Olyphant is one of the
best crime fighters on TV.
The  Pallisers  is one of the many high-falutin' soap operas that aired on PBS. The
intelligentsia may have frowned upon daytime soaps and certainly didn't stoop to Peyton
Place  and the like. But add a British accent and a stately home, and they're suckers for
"quality drama" (the quotes are to make fun of this distinction between art and Dallas ,
not to critique the show. Mind you, these British soaps had impeccable source material (inthis case the novels by Trollope) and casts to die for: it's hard not to have fun when starsSusan Hampshire and Philip Latham are joined by the likes of Jeremy Irons, DerekJacobi, Penelope Keith and Anthony Andrews.
THE  BELLS  OF  ST.  MARY'S($29.99 BluRay; Olive/Paramount)INTOLERANCE  ($49.99 BluRay;
Cohen)A  LETTER  TO  THREE  WIVES($24.99 BluRay; FOX)SHACK  OUT  ON  101  ($29.99
BluRay; Olive/Paramount)MONTY  PYTHON'S  THEMEANING  OF  LIFE  ($19.99 BluRay;
Universal)NORTH  TOALASKA  ($24.99
BluRay; Fox)DESK  SET  ($24.99
BluRay; FOX) -- It'sthe holidays, so whatbetter time to savorBing Crosby as apriest and IngridBergman as a nun inthe delightful comic</p>
<p>drama The  Bells  Of  St.
Mary's.  A Christmas
pageant scene makes
this ideal seasonalviewing, even thoughit's not centeredaround the holiday assuch. It belongs onthe short list of trulygreat sequels, thanksto being a follow-upto Going  My  Way.
Crosby won the Oscarfor Going My Wayand both movies weremonster box officehits so only Godknows why they didn'tmake a third filmabout the affableFather O'Malley.
D.W.
Griffith made the hateful, remarkably racist but technically innovative movie Birth  Of  ANation,  a film that perverted history to make heroes of the KKK and distort the Civil War.
In an attempt to make amends, Griffith created this centuries-spanning epic that lookedat the damage intolerance has wrought throughout history. If any good can be said aboutBirth , surely it is that it gave birth to Intolerance , an equally stunning work, which finds
Griffith at the height of his power. It's a pity not to see it on the big screen first, but thisBluRay is surely as good as anyone ever saw it when the movie first came out.
A  Letter  To  Three  Wives  is pure Hollywood melodrama delivered with class by Joseph L.</p>
<p>Mankiewicz and a cast that includes Ann Sothern, Linda Darnell and Jeanne Crain, the
three wives who discover a friend has run off with one of their husbands. A woman's
picture through and through and an Oscar nominee for Best Picture.
Shack  Out  On  101  is a genuine B movie that shows a young Elia Kazan making the most of
a very modest budget. It's a nutty tale of a waitress who realizes her business is a hotbed
of spies, but it's beautifully shot and features crackerjack talent like Lee Marvin and TerryMoore. This is why people love B movies and it's rare enough to still be a genuine find formost.
Anyone who knows Monty Python are performing in London next summer (anyone got a
spare ticket?) surely has already seen this swan song for the movies. The  Meaning  Of  Life
is a return to their sketch roots, with not even a hint of an overall plot. Like most suchcompilations, the result is varied. But the high points are many, including the gross-outdiner eating a wafer-thin mint and the Catholic family with literally hordes of children
that refuses contraception and sings "Every Sperm Is Sacred." One of the happiest
memories of my life is showing that one to my very Catholic mother, having her laugh and
be shocked but amused...and then hours later hearing her hum the song without realizing
where the tune came from.
Surely by now you realize John Wayne was a versatile star. No, he didn't disappear into
roles but he could tackle everything from the vengeful racist in The  Searchers  to the
romantic hero in The  Quiet  Man.  Comedy was within his range as well, as seen in North
To  Alaska,  an offbeat tale about a gold prospector who goes to Seattle to fetch the fiancee
of his partner. When the gal is already married, he drags back another woman instead but
of course they fall in love on the way. Nutty.
Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn were one of the great movie duos though honestly
about half their films aren't great. This is one of the good-not-great ones, though theircharm elevates the material tremendously. In Desk  Set,  Hepburn is the head of research at
a major network and any kids watching the movie will surely wonder why people call upthis research team and ask them questions like "Who are the seven dwarfs?" (Why don'tthey just google it, the kids will ask.) Tracy comes in with computers, a modern innovationthat will make the gals obsolete. Or so he thinks. Sparks fly, of course and no one doesthat better than these two. I don't turn to it often, but if it comes on TV or someone elsepulls out the title, I can't stop watching. They're that good together.
