8/05/2004 02:34:00 AM"The danger here is that once a president loses credibility with theCongress, as this president has through months of lies and deceit andmanipulations and deceptions, stonewalling, it raises into doubteverything he does and everything he says, and maybe everything hedoesn't do and doesn't say." He added: "I just hope and pray thedecision that was made was made on the basis of sound judgment,and made for the right reasons, and not made because it wasnecessary to save the president's job."Is this a Democrat daring to question Bush's honesty in the war onterror? Nope, it's Daniel R. Coats, then Republican senator fromIndiana and now the ambassador to Germany. He was attackingClinton and suggesting missile attacks against Al Quaeda were simplymotivated by a desire to make us all forget about Clinton's personalindiscretions.Just in case you thought it was unprecedented for someone toquestion the motives of the President :)
