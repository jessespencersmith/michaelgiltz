6/25/2005 12:09:00 PMThe US and the CIA have endured a lot of criticism forkidnapping people and sending them to countries where weknow they'll be tortured. Now the CIA may have to enduresome arrests. In Italy, the New York Times reports a judge hassubmitted arrest orders for 13 people who either work for orare linked to the CIA. Imagine, a country that expects the USto follow its laws. Two things struck me here, beyond theembarrassment for the US and the Berlusconi government.First, this note about where the CIA folk stayed:The [CIA] suspects stayed in five-star Milan hotels,including the Hilton, the Sheraton, the Galia and Principe diSavoia, in the week before the operation, at a cost of$144,984, the warrant says, adding that after Mr. Nasr wasflown to Egypt, two of the officers took a few days' holidayat five-star hotels in Venice, Tuscany and South Tyrol.Who the hell do they think they are? US Congressmen? Second, thiscomment by an Italian official:A senior Italian official said the apparent abduction ofMr. Nasr had disrupted the Italians' attempt toidentify his connection to a suspected terroristnetwork in Europe. "Our belief is that terrorist suspectsshould be investigated through legal channels and broughtto a court of law - not kidnapped and spirited away to betortured in some secret prison," the official said.Clearly, this guy is unpatriotic and weak in the war on terror.
