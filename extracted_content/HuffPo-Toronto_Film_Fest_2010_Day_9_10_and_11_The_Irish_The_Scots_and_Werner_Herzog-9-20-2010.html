DAY 9: JUVENILE DELINQUENTS, VIDEO
GAMES AND HORROR FILMS
NEDS  ** 
The first half of Neds  (short for Non-educated
Delinquents) had me very excited. Director Peter
Mullan's earlier drama The Magdalene Sisters was a
well-acted if heavy-handed look at the abuses ofyoung women by the system. Now he is telling the
story of a smart young kid with a vicious dad, a
criminal older brother and a world that wants to lowerhis expectations at almost every turn. The casting of
the two young actors who play John McGill (Gregg
Forrest and Conor McCarron) is spot-on. They're both excellent and look strikingly similar, making his
growth from little kid to bulky teenager very believable. John is very bright and some teachers doencourage him. But the spectre of his older brother, his nasty father and his poor circumstances frustrate
the boy at every turn. He snaps finally when a nice kid he befriends from a wealthy family is cut off from
him simply because he's lower class. John takes refuge in a gang and they drink and thug around inincreasingly violent ways. John is both victim and persecutor here. But I simply didn't buy the ham-
handed way he descended into Taxi Driver territory, no matter how inexorably brutal his world may be. A
compelling case study became a whacked out tale with multiple hard-to-swallow twists (especially fromhis dad) and not one but two crazily metaphoric moments, one with Christ stepping down from the Cross
and the other with John walking through a field of lions that is spoiled by what appear to be obvious
digital effects. Mullan has great skill and brought together an excellent cast. But like so many directors hepushes his stories into the extreme when small and quiet was proving far more effective.

<p>After Neds,  I had a chance to sit and chat with Midnight Madness impresario Colin Geddes. He's a
genuine enthusiast for all genres of movies, especially the under-appreciated horror, sci-fi, action, Hong
Kong, martial arts and other movie types that fall under the broad midnight movie banner. I'll link to my
feature when it appears in the Los Angeles Times. You can follow Colin on Twitter  or check out the
Action Fest,  which he just helped launch this year. At the end of the interview, he mentioned he was
intro-ing The Butcher, The Chef and the Swordsman,  a movie I'd missed earlier and was glad to sneak
into. I should have checked to see if the Rush line for movie fans was full and whether I was takingsomeone's place. Happily, the screening was full but not sold out so everyone got in and I wasn't a jerk.Or at least, not in this case.
THE BUTCHER, THE CHEF AND THE SWORDSMAN  ** 1/2
This entry from mainland China feels a lot more contemporary and smart and just plain cheeky than you
would expect from the People's Republic. Inspired by Peking Opera conventions, it's a broadly funny,
over-the-top melange of entertainment, containing stories within stories that nod and wink at the
audience at every turn. The Butcher is a fat, vulgar but decent fellow who falls hard for a beautiful
courtesan. Every time he tries to approach her the Butcher is frustrated by the evil Swordsman or
laughed off by the tea house mistress, who even breaks into a rap at one delirious moment. But that's just
the framework for all sorts of tales that revolve around a potent weapon: a butcher's cleaver crafted from
the metal of five legendary swords. The best story within a story revolves around a handsome mute whoworks as a servant in the restaurant of a master chef. The mute is really the son of a slaughtered family
who is planning revenge on the cruel court eunuch who is sure to come calling at this famous restaurant
sooner or later. It's a funny, but moving tale with genuine drama and emotion amidst the silliness.Director Wuerhsan delivers it with aplomb. The problem is that this should be the heart of the film.
Instead it's a diversion while the main focus is on the Butcher. The Butcher is like one of Shakespeare's
fools, perfect for comic relief but not potent enough to be the center of the tale. That fatal mistake is whatkeeps this caper from being more than a one-time pleasure. (Tossing in yet another fight scene staged as
a video game showdown doesn't help. This idea has been done to death, people.) Still, it's silly fun while
it lasts.
CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS  *** 1/2
I'm writing this sentence in the year 2010. Now imagine that someone came along in the year 7010
(some five thousand years later) and added this second sentence. Then the two sentences sit there side by
side until the year 32, 010 when we come along and see those sentences for the first time. That's the spanof time we have to grasp when watching this bewitching film. I would have been ashamed to come to the
fest and miss this new work Werner Herzog. It's a documentary -- shot in 3-D no less -- that explores a
recently discovered cave in France filled with drawings some 25,000 to 32,000 years old that rank as oneof the great cultural and archeological finds of all time. The cave is off limits to everyone except rare visitsby scientists. But Herzog being Herzog he is rightly given some brief hours to document the find. The
result is not as eccentric as his recent documentary Encounters At The End Of The World  but it's a
marvel nonetheless. And the usage of 3-D is spectacular; you want to reach out and stroke the walls again
and again. A hush fell over the crowd watching this film as we absorbed the images: a herd of horses

<p>galloping across one wall, the palm print of a visitor appearing over and over at the entrance and at
various points throughout the caves, not to mention the sheer beauty of the space itself. Herzog asks his
usual philosophical, probing questions that elicit unexpected remarks from the scientists. But hismasterstroke was commissioning the perfect score by Ernst Reijseger, which is angular and haunting,celestial and ancient, religious and earthy all at once. The postscript wanders off to a nearby sanctuarywhere albino alligators are spawned in the warm waters tossed off by a nuclear reactor and I don't quite
get the connection. But Herzog is always looking for those connections or just taking in the world in
wide-eyed wonder and he is the perfect tour guide. An experience.
DAY 10: DRINKING AND GAMBLING AND FIREWHITE IRISH DRINKERS  ***
TV talent John Gray ( The Ghost Whisperer ) takes a promising step into cinema with this solid coming of
age tale. Relative unknown Nick Thurston is very appealing as Brian Leary, a sensitive young lad growing
up in the rough and tumble of Brooklyn in the Seventies. His older brother is a petty thief. But Brian
works at the local cinema, convincing the owner to book rock acts from time to time, obsessively draws
in his basement hideaway and fancies the local travel agent with a sharp tongue but a friendly smile.
When Brian's boss unexpectedly pulls in a favor and arranges to have the Rolling Stones do a one hour
concert in Brooklyn, everyone's dreams collide, with Brian's brother pushing him to rob the place and his
boss hoping to avoid a death sentence from the local hood he owes too much money to. Melodrama
might intrude towards the end, but the acting is solid throughout and Thurston has a low-key charm --
he could be the kid brother to Kevin Connolly's Eric on Entourage . But unlike a player in Hollywood,
Brian has to learn that he has a right to play the game in the first place. Sweet, unforced.
CASINO JACK  **
Kevin Spacey stars in this broad, loopy look at Jack Abramoff, the disgraced lobbyist who was once the
toast of K Street and had direct access to the White House. We start with Spacey in prison, so we know
Abramoff is headed for a fall. But while Spacey has snap in the role, it's not that interesting to see himand his partner get ballsier and more crude in their influence peddling. I wish there were more sting,
either in Abramoff's self-awareness of his crimes or our awareness of how much we might enjoy similar
power. But they're basically jerks with no real talent for anything but bullying and coercion, so what's thefun in that? Jon Lovitz however steals away with another movie, thanks to his droll and very funny turnas a mattress king looking to get into casinos. A movie about him? Now that would be worth gambling
on.

<p>FIRE OF CONSCIENCE  ** 1/2
I caught the opening night movie at Midnight Madness. And after profiling Colin Geddes, I'm ready to
check out the closing night film, even if it does mean getting home at 3 in the morning. Soup to nuts! Myspace in line was held by Peter Kuling, a college professor, film critic,  pitch spokesman and actor I
bumped into last year at Midnight Madness. He needs to update his Facebook  (which focuses on his alter
ego Professor Kuling, the mind behind Recessionomics) but you can follow him on Twitter  and -- if
you're in Canada-- watch for him in a new Nikon camera campaign.
Anyway, Peter and his girlfriend held a seat for me and I dashed in at the last moment to see this Hong
Kong police flick that reveled in every Hong Kong police flick cliche I'd seen to date: corrupt butappealing cops, the noble loner who just won't play by the rules, a hapless sidekick who gets injured or
killed and an uber competent female cop (in this case May, played with dash by Michelle Ye, who
deserves her own film). The story becomes crazier and sillier as the movie progresses but it's a terrificshowcase for director Dante Lam, who's been turning films out for the past decade. He stages numerous
gun battles with daring style that make this undercooked storyline worth the ride. Undoubtedly Midnight
Madness programmer Colin Geddes has seen most of his work and could school me on Lam. Maybe he'salready made a great film and I missed it. But he deserves to be seen in the US (though the English
subtitles are terrible; I'd be glad to tweak them for you, guys). And here's hoping he gets a great script
sometime soon.
DAY 11; WESTERNS, KINGS AND MADDIN -- A WONDERFUL FINAL DAY
Argh. I just HAD to sleep in and missed the Errol Morris documentary Tabloid. I'm gutted. If I'd had a
ticket I would have gone. But I was going to have to get up three hours after falling asleep to get in linejust for the hope of seeing the film at 9:30 am. And I knew I'd be exhausted for the rest of the day and
decided to be smart. That meant sleeping in, sort of, and filing my profile of Colin Geddes in the
afternoon. Just before heading off to what I thought was my final film, I found out The King's Speech (amovie I really wanted to catch) had won the Audience Award and was going to be screening for free at 6
p.m. Huzzah!
MEEK'S CUTOFF  *** 1/2
What a great way to start off the final day. Director Kelly Reichardt gets better and better with every film
and here she fulfills the promise of Old Joy and Wendy & Lucy . The latter starred Michelle Williams as a
woman who lost her dog; her central riveting performance kept the slight story afloat. Here, Williams isFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST</p>
<p>part of a marvelous ensemble and while the plot comes fast and furious, it's presented in a low-key,
ambiguous manner that suits Reichardt to a t. In this Western set during the 1800s, three families are
headed west with their guide Meek (Bruce Breenwood). Meek is either lost or being urged by residents of
the Territory they're headed for to steer newcomers away to their deaths. (Too many Americans mightturn the Territory over to the US in a vote.) Meeks may be clueless or cruel but they undoubted needwater and the capturing of a "savage" gives them a chance to ignore Meeks and use this man to save
them. There you go. That it's, all delivered in an open-ended manner sure to frustrate general audiences.
But what a cast. Paul Dano is wonderful as a weak-willed man who only seems strong compared to hishysterical wife (Zoe Kazan) who sees Indians lurking behind every tree. The inestimable ShirleyHenderson is wittily on target as a woman constantly keeping an eye on her wandering son and a
husband who refuses water when it's scarce (to all of their detriment). Greenwood is wonderfully offbeat
as the guide and Will Patton is a rock of common sense as the husband of Williams, though their
relationship is a little tense. (She's his second wife and he seems uncertain about this woman with
opinions.) Without a hint of modernism, Williams creates a strong, fascinating character who insists onseeing the captured savage (Rod Rondeaux) as a man and not just an object of scorn or even pity.Exceptionally well-acted, quiet and observant this is pure art house fare, which is meant as a warning for
those who might want, you know, a little action and some answers, and as praise for a talented director
coming into her own.
THE KING'S SPEECH  ***
Middlebrow. That's the derogatory term for "prestige pictures," mainstream movies geared towards an
adult audience that is intelligent but not necessarily wildly bold or cutting edge. The Hurt Locker is arty.
The Blind Side is middlebrow. But I like middlebrow films, the sort of movies that studios are
increasingly reluctant to make. A friend dismissed The King's Speech but then added that the two centralperformances by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush were very good. Well, if a movie's two centralperformances are very good, it's got to be worth seeing. Is it a movie for my mom, I asked? "Exactly," he
said. "All our moms will love it. In fact, it should have been dedicated 'To Moms Everywhere.'"
Well, Mom, this one is for you. It tells the story of George VI, a reluctant king who was always in the
shadow of his glamorous brother and beloved if tradition-bound father. George (Bertie to his family) alsosuffers from a terrible stutter, which makes it painful to fulfill his obligations as a member of the RoyalFamily in the 30s. Thanks to his wife (a spot-on Helena Bonham Cater), Bertie finally finds a speech
therapist who can help him: the eccentric Aussie Lionel (Rush). In Lionel's home, under terms of equality
and respect, Bertie slowly and with difficulty starts to master his stutter. This is pure MasterpieceTheater, with both actors relishing the many comic moments in the script (cursing helps one avoid the
stutter, it should be said) and the drama in Bertie's situation. When his brother abdicates for the woman
he loves, Bertie is thrust onto the throne just as England needs a king to rally around for World War II.Tom Hooper's film is a broadly appealing, very funny and quite moving film. it's unquestionably headed
to the Oscars. I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that Firth and Rush will be nominated and Carter is a strong
possibility as well, not to mention the film and the director. Many festival audiences are friendly (atCannes, they give most everything a standing ovation and in Toronto solid applause is considered onlypolite). But the audience at this screening without the stars in attendance ate it up, laughing strongly andbursting into huge applause at the very end. This isn't just a prestige pic: it's a potential hit looking at
$50 million or more, handled properly. Me? I can't wait to take my mom.
GUY MADDIN  ****
Finally, I ended the fest on the perfect note by checking out the brilliant installation at the Lightbox by
Canadian director Guy Maddin, one of the best and most distinctive directors in the world today. If
you're in Toronto, by all means, check it out and take the time to watch at least some of the shorts hedisplays in full. I'll talk about it more in my festival wrapup on Tuesday.
