THEATER: "Scotland, PA" or, The Bloody King Of
Burgers
SCOTLAND,  PA  ** out of ****
ROUNDABOUT  AT  LAURA  PELS  THEATRE
Really, there are no bad ideas. It wasn't a bad idea to make a movie
called Scotland,  PA,  which set Shakespeare's Macbeth  at a burger joint
in the 1970s. I mean, why not? The movie was a poorly reviewed flop,
but with Maura Tierney and Christopher Walken in the cast (not tomention Andy Dick as one of the witches), it inevitably became a "cult"
classic. Now, turning a poorly reviewed, flop movie into a musical, well
that's certainly not a BAD idea either. Just...unexpected.
The result is Scotland,  PA  (and not, sadly, Scotland,  PA!  The
Musical! ). It's 1975 in Scotland, Pennsylvania where Mac (Ryan
McCartan) and his wife Pat (Taylor Iman Jones) are trapped in dead-
end jobs at greasy burger joint. Mac's got a ton of ideas to spruce theplace up. Plastic tables that are easier to clean! Chicken nuggets! Areally colorful sign with a giant "M." And a drive-through window. The
guy's a genius. But his boss ignores him and won't even give the kid a
try. When Mac proves the current manager is ripping the place off, theboss is mildly grateful...but insists his rebellious son Malcolm (WillMeyers) gets the job.
Modestly goaded on by Pat (mostly, she grumbles that it isn't fair),
they plan to rob the place, accidentally kill the boss, buy the joint
outright from Malcolm, turn it into a massive hit suspiciously like afast food chain that also begins with "M" and plan to go nationwide!You might even say Mac is a burger king. (The book by Michael
Mitnick is filled with such obvious bits.) If you know Macbeth , you
know Mac's meteoric rise comes with an equally meteoric fall, along
with ghosts, a wife haunted by her crimes and lots of blood.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>The mostly forgettable songs by Adam Gwon serve their function and
director Lonny Price does too, whether it's an efficient if anonymous
early number like "Drive Thru," a quick transformation from burger
dive into gleaming fast food emporium (Anna Louizos, nicely doing
what's expected) or the hard-to-stage bloody finale. Apparently, theirsuper-expensive (and pointy!) giant yellow M sits on the ground. Twonumbers stand out. "Clairvoyant" is distractingly built up into the
show's big number when it might have worked better in a more
intimate setting. "Why I Love Football" actually moves the storyforward with humor and a little heart, though even that has a filler linelike "Russell does pushups."
[Here's a music video for one of the show's big numbers. It featuresthe two stars but does not reflect the staging of the song in the actualmusical.]
Worse, the book bends over backwards to make its characters moreappealing. Pat, the Lady Macbeth character, hardly goads Mac on atall. Maybe she kvetches a little. And Mac seems about as ruthless as aBOOKS: Don't Bother Trying To

<p>disgruntled employee who might  steal rolls of toilet paper just to stick
it to the man.
Kinder characters neuter the relentless ambition which powers the
original play. Mac and Pat's first murder isn't a ruthless gambit toseize power. It's an accident! Worse, the musical removes a powerfulplot twist from the film. In the movie, the manager actually installs a
drive-in window to great success, but still ignores Mac. In the play, he
just ignores Mac's ideas, which makes the decision to burglarize thestore more random than desperate. In the movie, that's their moneyfrom their idea! Hey, if you want to tell a story about pretty decentpeople who get in over their heads, just don't make Macbeth !
The trappings are still there, including three witches (here seen asthree hippies), a ghostly vision during a live TV interview and thatbodies-piling-up finale. But the final result is barely Macbeth -adjacent
rather than the bloody Macbeth  Shakespeare wrote. And that's a
hamburger without meat.
Still the plot picks up in the second act and the two leads are
appealing. Most everyone has a decent voice, though not always whensinging those big notes for that AOR feel. Ironically, Will Meyers asMalcolm has one of the weaker voices, but still pulls off the show's bestsong with sex appeal and a warm presence.
Megan Lawrence killed in Broadway's The  Pajama  Game.  Here
Lawrence  does what she can to gin up a role as a suspicious detective
looking into this mess. And two veterans of Broadway's recent 
On  The
Town  revival are together again. Alysha Umphress (who was the
cabbie Hildy) has little to sink her teeth into as a hippie/witch. But Jay
Armstrong Johnson as the dim but likable Banko steals what littleshow there is with his comic timing. He makes you think Banko's big
number "Kick-Ass Party" is better than it actually is here. On the
downside, he's so likable, the show's desire to keep the audience onMac's side falls flat after he offs the poor dude.
That's a lot of talent and they make this too-harmless show bearable.
The actors didn't lack for courage but the creators did. Guys, the nexttime you want to tackle a power-hungry tale with a villainousprotagonist who slaughters everyone in his path until the curse of hisgreed brings him low, go for it. Screw your courage to the sticking
place and you will not fail.
