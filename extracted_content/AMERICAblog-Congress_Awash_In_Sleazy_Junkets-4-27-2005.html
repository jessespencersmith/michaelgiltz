4/27/2005 10:21:00 AMUSA Today reports that privately financed travel byCongressmen and Senators has totaled about 5400 trips in thelast five years -- half of them paid by non-profits who don'tneed to disclose who is paying the bills. The total cost of theseprivate junkets? About $16 million.For a government that spends billions of dollars, is it reallynecessary to ransom our politicians' souls for a measley $16million just so they can cozy up to big business and take nicegolfing trips?Here's an easy fix: ban ALL travel financed by outside groupsof any nature. If you are a Congressman or Senator youCANNOT accept any travel -- not a private jet to Scotland to hitthe links; not a taxi down the street.Create an annual slush fund for travel for these politicans,divide it up evenly, with more for seniority and more for headsof committees, who'd presumably need to travel more. Letthem spend the money as they will, be it vacation orfact-finding mission, but EVERY SINGLE TRIP will be detailedand every one will be reported annually by law to theirconstituents, including price, length and purpose of stay and soon. Once they're spending OUR tax money, see how often theygo on that "fact-finding" trip to London or Fiji, with moneyspent on golf and tennis and scuba diving. Since lobbyists andnon-profits would be BANNED from giving them these gifts, itwould be one less source of sleaze in our government.
