 Inspiring Funny Typical Scary Outrageous Amazing Infuriating ExtremeWhy I Love Baseball
So Major League Baseball is running a contest to pick
some lucky (?) baseball fan who will spend an entireseason eating, sleeping, drinking, breathing and bloggingabout baseball. They'll watch every game humanlypossible, give interviews, write stories about it, tweet,blog, crack wise, sing, you name it. A friend sent me alink to the entry form. (I'm a devoted Yankee fan with
two season tickets in the bleachers.) Then another friend
sent me the link. Then another. And another.
I glanced at the rules and info and realized I would
never get picked. I know a lot about movies and musicand TV and a lot of other topics. I know a lot about theYankees. But baseball in general? I'm no expert. I find it
challenging enough to keep up with the ins and outs of one team. (Now tennis I could yabber on about....)But one of the questions on the entry form caught my eye: why do you love baseball, in 500 words orless? Why do I love baseball? I suddenly found myself waxing poetic (when I wasn't checking the wordcount). Nothing brings out the sentimental fool in a fella quite like baseball. So here's what I wrote. I
could have gone on and on, but here it is in about 498 words. When you're done, tell me why you  love
baseball.
WHY I LOVE BASEBALLMy love of baseball -- and especially the New York Yankees -- came through the movies. I grew up in
South Florida when there was no major league baseball team based there. Until I moved to New YorkCity in 1991, I'd never been to a baseball game -- not little league, not softball, not the minors, not the

<p>pros.
But I loved the movies. And some of the best sports movies of all time have been baseball movies. Bull
Durham. Pride Of The Yankees. Bang The Drum Slowly. Eight Men Out. Field Of Dreams. Fear StrikesOut.  So I was primed to love baseball when I entered Yankee Stadium in May of 1991 and sat in the front
row of the upper deck just past first base. I came back a few weeks later and then again. And then again.
The following season I went to about ten games and soon migrated to the bleachers. Year by year, the
number of games increased. And this was when it took dedication to sit in the bleachers. They only sold
tickets on the day of the game and if it was a popular one, you had to arrive very early or you'd be shut
out. Suddenly, a game that already took three hours to watch was a six or seven hour event. But I was
hooked.
First it was the excitement. But now it's the lulls as much as the hits and strike-outs, the chance to chat
with lifelong friends I've made in the Bleacher Creature section (and who forwarded me an email
insisting I apply). I call it urban fishing. You sit and relax and chat and show a little patience and every
once in a while something happens. And this is the amazing part: time after time, you see something
you've never seen before.
Until baseball, I never realized how much satisfaction you could receive out of cheering others on. I
enjoyed watching sports but always preferred to play them. I never imagined I would be so obsessed witha team, feel such joy over winning a game or clinching a post-season berth. You don't say, "They won!"You say, "We won!" And you mean it.
The winning is sweet, naturally. But that's not why I go to 40+ games a year. It's the humbling awareness
that I can study baseball all my life and still have more to learn. It's the mini-dramas that take place
during every at-bat. It's watching a player grow and apply themselves and become a star. It's pinpointing
the ones that don't apply themselves; the ones who drive you nuts by squandering their chance. It'sraging at a move of the manager or a trade by the owner. It's insisting the moves and trades that do workout were ones you championed all along. It's high-fiving the person next to you when you've never seenthem before and don't even know their name. It's starting fresh every spring training. It's baseball.
