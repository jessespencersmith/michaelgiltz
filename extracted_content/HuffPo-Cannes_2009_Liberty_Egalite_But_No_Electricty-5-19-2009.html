 Cannes 2009: Liberty, Egalite, But
No Electricty!
Read More:  Cannes , Cannes Electricity , Cannes Film
Festival, Cannes Power , Power Outage , Strike , Entertainment News
The Cannes Film Festival has seen some
fireworks onscreen but is starting to lack power
where it matters most: at the generators. French
workers are striking one of the nation's powersuppliers and power is being cut throughout
Cannes grid by grid. So far, they've spared the
main buildings where the festival is held. Butmarket screenings throughout the city have beencancelled here and there. Other stores -- like
FNAC, an electronics store deluged with festgoers
both day and night -- were turning people awayas recently as one hour ago. It's a 24 hour strike
and should end some time tonight, hopefully without affecting the black tie premiere of PedroAlmodovar's "Broken Embraces," which received a ho-hum reception from critics this morning.

Strikes are no stranger to Cannes. One year, people were lining up to empty every ATM in sight of
cash because the security guards who guard the people who bring the cash to the ATMs were on
strike. Money was literally becoming scarce. That strike lasted the entire festival.
And anyone foolish enough to travel on Tuesday (like me) faces another strike: rail-workers are
joining countless others nationwide in a 24 hour walk-out to voice their displeasure with FrenchPresident Nicolas Sarkozy. Hey, someone should make a film about all those strikes. Too bad theywon't be able to screen them in Cannes until the strike is over.
Still think Cannes is glamorous? Check out this unidentified reporter who is writing a story while
balancing his laptop on a motorcycle parked along the main Croissette.
