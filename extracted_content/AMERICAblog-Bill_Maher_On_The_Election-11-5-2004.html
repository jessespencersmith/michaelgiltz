11/05/2004 10:29:00 AMTonight is the season finale of "Real Time With Bill Maher" on HBO at11 p.m. It's one of the sharpest shows around, kind of like a Sundaymorning news show with attitude and a lot more cursing. And Mahergrills his guests with the kind of pointed questions that Ted Koppelused to specialize in.Here's Maher's take on what the Dems should do:"The Democrats need to do what the Republicans did this time.Energize their base. I really don’t think there are more Jesus-lovingcrazy people in this country than sane people. I just think that thosepeople vote more. When it comes time to getting out the vote withyour base, they’re more energized because they’re hearing themessage they really want to hear. Whereas the Democrat is trying tohave it both ways. He’s trying to get his people and he’s also trying toget enough of those kind of people. And those kind of people arenever going to come over. They’re always going to vote for the Bush."-- Bill MaherMaher's guests tonight will include Noam Chomsky (whom I assumedidn't vote for Bush) and conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan whowill undoubtedly say that now the election is over we need to"support" our President. Which means what exactly, look the otherway when he behaves incompetently or lies? How does one support aPresident with a reverse-Midas touch? Especially when his screwupsmean young men and women are dying every day? I agreephilosophically but just don't know how it would work realistically --do you let Bush nominate any Supreme Court justice? Do you let himkeep spending us into a fiscal crisis? Do you not keep askingquestions about ammo dumps in Iraq and how many there are andhow many are being guarded as of this moment?
