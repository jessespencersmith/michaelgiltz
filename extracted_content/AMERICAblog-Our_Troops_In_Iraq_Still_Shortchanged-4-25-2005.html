4/25/2005 06:14:00 AMThe NYT has an excellent, despairing story about an illustriousMarine unit in Iraq and the travails they underwent thanks to alack of armor on their vehicles and a lack of troop support.Stories like these should be on the FRONT PAGE every day untilour men and women get the full support they deserve.Among the sad details: soldiers propping up cardboarddummies at outposts to fool the enemy when we wereundermanned; soldiers forced to literally hold shut the doorson vehicles that wouldn't stay closed on their own; and thetravesty of justice about an excellent Marine who fought forbetter treatment of his men and was rewarded with seeing hiscareer go down the toilet.But among the tales of low funding and lack of committment,here's the kicker: the Marines are finally going it alone to makecertain all the Humvees of their troops will be fully armored.They expect to reach 100%...BY THE END OF THE YEAR. Yep,it's another eight months away.
