 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyFringeFest NYC Finale - Fun "Pear"
and Great "Mountain"
FringeFest NYC  is winding up its encore series of the
most acclaimed shows from the festival. That gave me a
chance to catch up with two treats that help make this
year another winner for uncovering new talent andshows with great promise. Pearl's Gone Blue  is a musical
that with work could become very special; it already hasthe talent. And The Mountain Song  introduced me to the
terrific company PigPen.
PEARL'S GONE BLUE  *** out of ****
It's no secret that a strong cast and good story can hold
an audience's attention without elaborate sets. But it's
good to be reminded of that every once in a while and
FringeFestNYC  does that in spades. Pearl's Gone Blue  is a great example. A table and a few chairs plus
an excellent guitarist on the side provide all the backdrop it needs to tell its story.
Seddy Pearl (Roz Beauty, well named) is a church-going schoolteacher who is ready for a little fun. She
and her best friends Bell (Benja K. Thomas) and Tiny (Pamela Monroe) are out having fun when they
realize the blues singer performing in their small town is Beau (Billy Eugene Jones), a handsome fellowwho had left for the bright lights years ago. Beau immediately takes a shine to Seddy -- who has grown upvery nicely since he last saw her -- and you might expect the usual tale of a bluesman seducing the nice
girl and drawing her into trouble. Not really. Pearl's Gone Blue  is more complicated and real than that.
Seddy is hardly a blushing wallflower (though Beauty has great fun teasing out her sensuality). Beaudoesn't just waken her physical desires; he also awakens her desire to sing the blues. Everyone knows she

<p>has the best voice at church on Sunday. Can she cut it on Saturday night as well? Things turn dark when
Seddy keeps a charm that Beau loses, a powerful talisman that contains his dreams and helps him toperform. Beau loses his mojo and Seddy starts to get stronger and more forceful. Meanwhile, her friends
struggle with their own desires including an ailing sister and a dream of opening a BBQ joint.
Most of the songs in the show come out naturally as performances in a club or the casual singing among
friends and are serviceable to good. The strongest factor is the easy camaraderie among the cast. You
quickly accept that these three women are old friends. Act Two could use more focus. The women bickerfrom the start and it's not as clear as it should be that the bickering from act one has turned into
bitterness and a potentially irrevocable split in act two. We should feel more strongly that the amulet is
poisoning everything in their lives.
but the book by Leslie Kramer already has a great deal of heart and humor. And the songs by her and
Gabriel Gordon offer the core of a solid score in the making. The direction by Julie Kramer is brisk andefficient, surely a major reason why the show feels so whole even at this stage. Casting helps a great deal,
with Thomas and Monroe very strong and Jones appealing even as he becomes weaker and weaker.
Tiffany Thompson does well in the dual role of a battling neighbor and an uptown blues singer.Thompson delivers her tune with just enough smoothness to convince she's a success but leaving enoughroom for grit from our heroine to establish who the real deal really is. It's a generous choice.
Beauty is a delight throughout. Even when she's not speaking, you can focus on her face and now exactly
what Seddy is thinking and feeling. She mines the humor of the script and the darkness, without ever
tipping into broad brushstrokes. She's a find. And an unexpectedly subtle finale gives the show an
emotional heft that an easier, more feel-good ending would have lost. Good fun right now, but Pearl'sGone Blue  has a lot of potential.
PIGPEN PRESENTS: THE MOUNTAIN SONG  *** 1/2 out of ****
If the Avett Brothers branched out into theater, you might expect them to deliver the tunes that pepperthe folk/country/Americana score of The Mountain Song.  The theater company PigPen  became the first
troupe in history to win the overall excellence award at FringeFest  two years in a row with this show.
And no wonder, it's a one hour delight brimming with a talented cast, delightful puppetry, a sweet but sad
tale delivered at just the right length and with charm to spare.
Even before the show begins you know you're in for a good time because the entire troupe is onstage
diving into one rousing instrumental after another while the audience claps along. They've won us over
even before the curtain rises. Then comes a tall tale about a father raising a mute daughter. Hereluctantly sends her off to the big sister to learn to talk with her hands. She sends word years later that
she's getting married but the details are muddled. So the father goes on a quest down the three different
rivers that lead from their mountain home (his only clue is that it's taking place at the end of a river) totry and find his daughter and celebrate her happiness.
This story is told through song and puppetry. The title credits appear as clouds floating behind an
illuminated screen. The daughter is seen as simply a tiny dress that one cast member manipulates. (How

<p>quickly our imagination adapts so that simply having the dress tilt forward or side to side can become an
eager "yes" or a sad "no.") The biggest man in the world is a giant foam head held up by yet another cast
member. And on and on, from a piece of folding cloth to mimic a bird to a wooden platform turning from
a raft into a flying machine.
This is all delivered with ease and pleasure by the cast, all of whom are onstage for most of the show
singing songs, playing instruments and diving in to turn a prop into a character at the drop of a hat. You
smile from start to finish, even as the story gets a little sad, as stories sometimes do. It never hurts thatthe all-male PigPen players are cute as a button, either. You want to buy their CD if they had one (the
songs are that good) and friend them on Facebook all at the same time.
The book could use a little tightening. And the avuncular narrator Ben Ferguson holds the stage well as a
performer, handling the bulk of the show's narrative drive. But his voice might be the weakest of thebunch; he'd shine more on "The Mountain Song" if that were his main solo. But everyone from MattNuernberger as the dad on down handles the stage with the ease of people who belong there.
PigPen  is definitely a six-man company (recent grads from Carnegie-Mellon) to keep an eye on. They are
remounting last year's success The Nightmare Story  in October. And next year they'll be bringing an all
new show to Manhattan. I for one won't want to miss any of it.
