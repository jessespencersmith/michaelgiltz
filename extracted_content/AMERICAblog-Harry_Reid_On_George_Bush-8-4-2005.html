8/04/2005 03:45:00 AM"The New Yorker" has a very good profile of Senate MinorityLeader Harry Reid by Elsa Walsh. Well worth reading -- he'sdefinitely a social conservative (Mormon) and I can't REALLYgive my heart to someone who doesn't think I deserve thesame basic civil rights as everyone else in this country. (Callme crazy.) But he's tough and a seasoned backroom dealer. Myfavorite anecdote is about when Reid was overseeing (withothers) gambling for the state of Nevada and someone tried tobribe him. Reid helped the cops set up a sting. But when theywere busting the guy, Reid tried to strangle him because hewas so angry the guy thought Reid could be bribed! My kind offellow.Reid's most interesting perspective is on the filibuster. Some ofus have been wary of the deal, which included putting throughthree of Bush's stalled nominees and, arguably, holding off the"nuclear option" showdown for another day, rather thandefeating it. Reid says simply he wasn't certain he could winover enough Republicans to defeat it and was glad he didn'thave to find out. Fair enough. But here's a doozy you'll love --Reid's comment on Bush at a public speech. At an elementaryschool, no less."I didn't come here to beat up on President Bush," he said."But I have served three Republican Presidents. PresidentReagan -- I cared a great deal for him, and he got most ofwhat he wanted. If you disagreed with him, he did not holdit against you." He went on, "President Bush No. 1 is such anice person. Some of my most prized possessions are thethree letters he wrote me. But this President is totallydifferent. He takes after his mother. It's either hisway or no way. It's very, very difficult." Even Reid seemedsurprised by the depth of his reaction. "I'm sorry to giveyou this report on President Bush," he said, "but that's howI feel."Ouch.
