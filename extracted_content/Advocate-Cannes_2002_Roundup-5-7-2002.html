the Cannes film feSlival promised 
fUlure fun as well as some milder 
moments of gay and lesbian desire for 
the here and now. Then there's 
{,.re'·~"sihll!, a French Ml!lm:I1fO with a 
scene in a gay bar that's both hard to 
take and a must-scc.

performance as --fiercely proud." 
On the mild side was Blue Gale Cros.Jing, a 
Tai~:;c film about high school S1udcnlS 
and $oCxuaJ confusio n. Since one of the 
leads is a prell)' boy on the swimming leam. 
it threw us for a loop .... hen!he same-sex 
desire sprang from his sir\rrier>d, who' d 
ratlH:r hold hands with her best paltlum 
with her dreamy beau. 
An even IJlC)le W1CXpecteO love trians1c 
came in The Embalmer. an Italian film 
about a middle-aged dwarf and taxidermist 
who shyly vies with a prelly sir! for the 
attention of his vay tall and handsome new 
assistant. The film is !iIIOng enough 10 make 
the compelilion real (you don 'I actually 
know who will triumph) but it "hie kens out

tensiOll belween !he men. 
Equally timid was the translator of one 
French film's title: A literal rcnderins 
would be The PU$$}' Wjlll Two Heads. but 
the festival officially designatoo its English 
lillc as the bland. meaningless Glowjng 
Eyes. Stronge, since the film itself is so 
very explicit-it's SCI enlirely in an adult 
theater showing straight porn. where male 
clients and trans"es!ites ( .. tJo "''Quldn'l pass 
for female in the darkest oralltys) have 
sex. With full fronlal nudity and actors 
apparently performing sex acts on camera. 
it's the latest film to blur the diSlinction

be I%rt.ain dim:tor lacqucs NolO! had an in

A \rue oddball was 17 rima C.:t;iI£ 
Cassard. IlIlOIheT Freroell film. In this one, a 
widow bereft after the death of her husband 
finds iIOLace in her gay friends and a TM:W 
zest for life after watching men have casual 
SCl( by a river. I\'$ good 10 know cruising 
can be beJ1eficial for others and nol just the

finally, there's Irre\V!:rsib!.t. by writer­
direclorGaspar No.!, the movie !hal really 
"'lIS the scandal orthe festival. Technically 
brilliant and s~ly the most ludacious film 
since Pulp Fie/ion. Noe's provoealivt: piece 
has an almost unbeanblc: rope SlCCne and an 
equally horrifie murder. TIle murder, 
unfortunate ly, takes place al a gay bar 
aIled the Rectum during one of the first 
scenes of the film. It· s a red-lighled descenl 
into hell, complete with heaving, panling 
grotesqueries and a crowd so jaded thai 
when Ihe protagonist begins to crusllihe 
skull ora man, inslead of running for their 
lives like any sane person they stand around 
MawedM by the beauty of the killing and 
practically applaud It the end. "The lurid and 
ludiel"OU$ aspects of the Rectum come in a 
film that simply can'l be ignored. It's told 
backward '13 Akmenlo and has a visteral, 
overwhelming power (and in the end a true 
beauty) that lJ1eans this movie will be: secn 
and those sleazy, absurd moments will have 
10 be discussed and disxeted. Like the 
movie, they \;lin 'I just be dismissed .
