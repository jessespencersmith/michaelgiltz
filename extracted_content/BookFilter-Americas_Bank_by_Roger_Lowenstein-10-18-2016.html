From the Publisher: A tour de force of historical reportage, America’s
Bank illuminates the tumultuous era and remarkable personalities that
spurred the unlikely birth of America’s modern central bank, the FederalReserve. Today, the Fed is the bedrock of the financial landscape, yet thefight to create it was so protracted and divisive that it seems a smallmiracle that it was ever established. For nearly a century, America, alone
among developed nations, refused to consider any central or organizing
agency in its financial system. Americans’ mistrust of big government andof big banks—a legacy of the country’s Jeffersonian, small-governmenttraditions—was so widespread that modernizing reform was deemedimpossible. Each bank was left to stand on its own, with no central
reserve or lender of last resort. The real-world consequences of this
chaotic and provincial system were…

What We Say
Actually, watching sausage being made is rather fascinating. That's what I learned from Roger Lowenstein's nonfiction work
"America's Bank: The Epic Struggle To Create The Federal Reserve." Make no mistake -- this is a story about legislation,lawmaking designed to create a central bank for the US (just like the rest of the developed world) despite massive popular
resistance to the very idea of big government. And it was the Democratic Party -- whose Jacksonian DNA rebelled against
federal power -- that made it happen. Oh how times have changed. Lowenstein lays out the story of what became known asthe Aldrich Plan very ably, from the many panics (capped by the Panic of 1907) that made the need for a central bankShare This Book

<p>painfully obvious to the tussle over actually making it happen. He details the secret meeting held on Jekyll Island that laid
the groundwork for the Aldrich Plan to its transformation in Congress and how investigations into Wall Street corruption and
politicians voting to benefit their own investments colored the final deal. The tale has many heroes including the noble
embrace of the idea by President Woodrow Wilson. But above all Lowenstein champions the role of Paul Warburg, a GermanJew who became a naturalized citizen while he argued and cajoled and analyzed the plan in all its various permutations.Lowenstein manages to make financial debates and legislative back and forth both comprehensible and engaging, no smallfeat. You'll learn how the Great Depression of 1929 and the Great Recession of 2008 were both ameliorated by elements of
the Federal Reserve. And yet those financial tragedies might have been softened much more or even prevented if certain
battles had been won at the start. That makes this a far from remote story. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“As Roger Lowenstein tells it in ‘America’s Bank,’ an illuminating history of the Fed’s unlikely origin story, the
central bank represented an ambitious — and not entirely successful — effort to resolve several long-standingtensions that lay at the heart of the American experiment in self-government: East Coast vs. the interior, urban
sensibilities vs. rural ones, mercantile vs. agrarian interests, Wall Street vs. Main Street. It is still working out
the kinks.”— Washington Post  
“The fun of the book — and its enduring value — lies in the rich details about the cranks, pawns and prophets
who jousted with one another in the days of Teddy Roosevelt, William Taft and Woodrow Wilson.” –  Forbes
“Roger Lowenstein tells, vividly and compellingly,…the remarkable tale of the politics, disagreements, decisionsand crises that culminated in the Federal Reserve Act…But Lowenstein, the author of several works on economics
and finance, builds off it to describe the history of the era, the rise of the Progressive movement, the
compromises and machinations that were critical to Congressional passage and the key figures in the drama of
creating the Federal Reserve System.”—Robert…
