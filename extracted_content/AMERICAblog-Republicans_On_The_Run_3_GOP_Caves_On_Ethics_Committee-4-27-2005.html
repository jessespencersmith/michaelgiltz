4/27/2005 12:50:00 AMThe Washington Post reports that the GOP has caved on theethics committee.House Republican leaders, acknowledging that ethicsdisputes are taking a heavy toll on the party's image,decided yesterday to rescind a controversial rule changethat led to the three-month shutdown of the ethicscommittee, according to officials who participated in thetalks.I especially loved their "positive" spin on this.A congressional aide said that changing the rules will mean"a couple of great days for Democrats" but that Republicanshave calculated this will deny them long-term use of theethics issue heading into next year's midterm elections.Uh actually, changing the rules to coddle a serial ethical violater,trying to insist that even someone indicted on serious charges couldbe party leader and punishing Republicans who try to hold everyone-- including DeLay -- to reasonable ethical standards is still going toplay badly in 2006.
