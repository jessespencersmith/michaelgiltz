9/10/2004 01:58:00 AMThe shame of Abu Ghraib -- wherein US soldiers tortured, raped andbeat to death prisoners in Guantanamo, Afghanistan and Iraq --continues to grow. At every stage, the Bush administration tries topretend these are very limited actions of a few bad apples, when thepractices have been widespread and condoned up and down thecommand chain.During Congressional testimony, the latest facts to emerge are thatdozens if not up to a hundred or more prisoners were hidden fromthe International Red Cross by the CIA so we didn't have to gothrough the niceties of obeying international law. The total is far morethan previously reported."But even some Republicans were scathing in their comments. 'Wehad a gigantic failure of leadership - one that a year ago, I wouldhave said was impossible to have in the United States Army,' saidRepresentative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota, who is a retiredMarine colonel."Impossible? Not in George Bush's Army.
