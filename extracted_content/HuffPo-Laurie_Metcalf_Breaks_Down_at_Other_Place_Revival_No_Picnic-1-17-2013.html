MANHATTAN THEATRE CLUB AT SAMUEL J. FRIEDMAN THEATRE
Over-stuffed isn't quite the right word. I'm looking for a term that describes plays like
this, plays with so many different storylines and ideas that they exhaust each other
out. Whatever that word might be, playwright Sharr White attempts to juggle so many
balls that it distracts from appreciating any of them.
White offers up a confessional play filled with a present-day presentation, flashbacks
and delusional memories. We're told about a teenage daughter who runs away from
home and tragically disappears forever, a man accused of luring her away who isdriven to suicide, a world-class scientist turned marketing maven launching a new pillthat will be worth billions on the market, a mental and/or physical breakdown and theirony of that scientist suddenly suffering from the very illness the pill combats... eventhough the scientist wasn't driven to study that illness because of any family historywith the disease. Any one of these storylines would be rich material for a complex,interesting play. But the tottering structure overwhelms our interest in any oneelement.
Laurie Metcalf holds the stage as Juliana and is the main reason the show works tothe degree that it does. Her tale is framed like a presentation at a medical conference,the very task Juliana is performing when she has an "episode," that is, shows the firstsigns of her medical condition. It's easy to see how this is all meant to tie together:Juliana suffers from an illness that messes with her memory, which is fine since shedoesn't want to remember the terrible night when her daughter disappeared forever.False memories about the long-dead daughter reaching out to her mother andagreeing to meet at their weekend home (the other place of the title) are welcomeindeed. Metcalf digs into every caustic, unpleasant, lashing out of Juliana as she sinksinto despair, offering up what drama she can. Daniel Stern as her husband is moreadrift. From scene to scene he seems to waver: is he the loving husband, the false
memory of a philanderer, the tortured father who bitterly resents Juliana for driving
away their daughter? Stern seems to choose none of the above and fades into thebackground.April 30, 2014

<p>Once we realize Juliana is having a breakdown and her memories are often self-
deluding, nothing is left to happen. We might ponder exactly why her husband
remains so loving, giving the tragic devastation Juliana perhaps unintentionallywrought but we certainly won't find the answer here. She's got a terrible disease andthe very drug she's developed might perhaps offer help. Ironic? Yes, but also ratheruninteresting.
In contrast, the set by Eugene Lee & Edward Pierce is a model of clarity. It uses
wooden window frames staggered one on top of the other to create a vivid and
striking wall. Juliana is trapped in her mind, unable to see out properly and the set
captures that subtly and easily, especially when combined with the moody, strikinglighting of Justin Townsend. Unfortunately, director Joe Mantello cannot bring his
usual skills to bear on a work that is just as incapable as Juliana of seeing its way
clearly to a story that doesn't get in its own way.

ROUNDABOUT THEATRE COMPANY AT AMERICAN AIRLINES THEATRE
Sometimes the stock of a playwright falls for a very good reason. Such is the case
with William Inge, a wildly successful artist in the 1950s whose work quickly seemeddated and fell strongly out of favor. He's a modest talent whose most famous works --Bus Stop, Come Back Little Sheeba, Picnic -- are at best modest entertainments. Butyou need the best possible casting to bring such slim material to light and that's farfrom the case in Roundabout's revival of Picnic . The show has impeccable actors in
key roles, such as Mare Winningham, Ellen Burstyn, Elizabeth Marvel and ReedBirney.
But the young lovers at the show's heart -- the two people who can't keep their hands
off each other and send their world a-tilting -- are played by Maggie Grace of Lost  in
her Broadway debut and Sebastian Stan of the film Captain America  in his second
Broadway show. Despite the almost laughably aggressive attempts to sex up Stan
and his body (when he shows up late in the show and still  hasn't buttoned up his shirt,
it inspires chuckles), they have absolutely no chemistry together and one fears nochemistry with anyone else either. Even with the best casting in the world, this showwould never be more than mild, passable fare. But without a beating heart at thecenter, it never comes to life
The story is banal, contrasting the many options of Grace's character (who is prettyand dating the handsomest and richest boy in town, the appealing Ben Rappaport)with the limited future of Marvel's spinster-ish schoolteacher. She's been datingBirney's businessman for years but he's in no hurry to get married. Aren't things finethe way they are?
The show has a few interesting moments of desperation, such as the scene where
Marvel begs, literally begs Birney to call her the next morning after a night of passion.Similarly, Mare Winnignham desperately clings to Grace's luggage when she sees herdaughter throwing away her life on the layabout no good loser Stan.
But generally the show slides along, a mild chuckle here as middle-aged women
gawp at the shirtless Stan, a mild moment of drama there as Stan and Grace give into their passions and Stan loudly proclaims, "We ain't going to no picnic!"
The set by Andrew Lieberman is perfunctory at best, with the homes of Winningham
and Burstyn abutting one another and sharing a tiny strip of lawn where all the action</p>
<p>takes place. It's all crowded right towards the edge of the stage, as if he couldn't be
bothered to fill up the rest of the space. All the other tech elements from director
Andrew Gold are equally bare. One feels everyone realized the play they wereworking with simply didn't inspire.
Any modest pleasures come from the sidelines, with Madeleine Martin doing what she
can with Grace's tomboy little sister and Burstyn and Winningham standing aroundand reacting to what's going on. It's a relief just to have them sitting together towardsthe end of the show; you know you're in good hands. Shockingly, this is the verytalented Winningham's Broadway debut (which should have happened long ago, mostrecently with the excellent drama Tribes ). Hopefully, she'll return to Broadway very
very soon in a much better show.
OPUS NO. 7  ** 1/2 out of ****
ST. ANN'S WAREHOUSEThe Russian troupe Dmitry Krymov Laboratory comes to St. Ann's with two one act
pieces, one a meditation on World War II and the Holocaust, the other on the
conflicted life and legacy of composer Dmitry Shostakovich, an artist who fell in and
out of favor throughout his career in the Soviet Union and was a patsy of thetotalitarian regime or perhaps a clever rebel who mocked them and made his proteststhrough his music or more likely a man striving moment to moment to survive and dowhat he could.
Both pieces are essentially wordless spectacles, with the troupe beginning with some
seemingly innocuous task (like splattering paint on a white wall) that slowly,marvelously expands into some visual stunner combining puppetry, circus-like anticsand imaginative use of set design.
Photo by Pavel Antonov
Unquestionably both "Genealogy" and "Shostakovich"have their moments. You watch quietly as actors cutaway at the cardboard backdrop, create shapes akin to
the familiar silhouette of early 20th century Jews (the hat,
the black clothes) and then before you know it, the
silhouettes along the wall are "dancing" and moving as
arms punch out through the cardboard and sway backand forth. Later one man holds "hands" with a paintedgroup of children and then he steps away and his coatand hat remain, still holding hands with the children. Inthe highlight, holes in the wall open up and scraps of
newspaper swirl out at the audience in a storm of text and actors grab at the scrapsand read off the names of the people who are missing. Video, text, photos and soundall combine with the actors and props like a seemingly endless outpouring of shoes(their owners long gone) to capture the disappearance of an entire people and way oflife.
In "Shostakovich," the highlights are perhaps the cleverly ironic uses of his own music
to tell the composer's story as he scrambles around Charlie Chaplin-like to avoid thebullets that pick off his contemporaries one by one. When Chaplin scampers this wayand that, always just out of reach of the authorities, they finally pin him down not withguns but with medals, a giant Order Of Lenin that has a giant pin which slices through
him completely. At one point -- somehow -- Shostakovich is dangling in mid-air,
clutching for dear life to a chandelier while a man high above him holds on to theornament and a piece of furniture is caught on the artist's foot. It's amusing and sad:they show a real empathy for Shostakovich, refusing to simply ennoble or denigrate aman trapped in such a difficult time.
Those moments stay with you. The problem is that each one takes quite a bit of effort
to reach and Krymov has yet to find a theatrically satisfying way of holding ourattention while each effect is slowly created. Yes, it's fun to see metal pianos bashingand clanging against each other like bumper cars and for a change the slow paradeas they're wheeled into the performance space has a certain drama. But too often wesimply sit and watch patiently while an effect is built, with the payoff only coming atthe end.
If the on-stage creation of their imagery can become as intriguing as the peak
moments, then Dmitry Krymov Laboratory will become not merely a worthy andinteresting troupe but a great one.
DECEIT  * 1/2 out of ****
THEATER FOR THE NEW CITY
Deceit is no way to live your life. That's the message of the uninteresting drama by
Richard Ploetz that just now has discovered that people can create new identitiesonline and enjoy secret second or even third lives separate from their "real" ones.</p>
<p>The protagonist is Frank, a businessman who has a wife and little boy. But online he
goes by Bob and enjoys secretive gay assignations, sex without the commitmentwhich is all he wants or thinks he needs, depending on whom he's talking to. "Bob"decides to open up to a reporter doing a story on men married to women who cheatwith other men. That reporter happens to be working for... Frank's wife. That's furthercomplicated by Frank starting to actually date a man (rather than just sleeping withhim and moving on), a clerk at an Hermes store who befriends... Frank's wife! If youexpect it all to come tumbling down and these various people to cross paths, youwon't be disappointed.
Photo by Adele Bossard
A few modest moments provide a spark in thistale: a scene in a park in which Frank and his sonmust interact with Frank's boyfriend and a dinner
party at which everyone shows up and the
reporter and boyfriend find it impossible not to callFrank by his online name of "Bob."
Otherwise, it's just a banal rehash of familiar
material, like Frank getting beat up during somerough sex, and some odd touches such as hisson's bizarre habit of saving Frank's used dentalfloss. Despite the pedestrian script, Steven Hauckholds the stage as Frank. The script may notmake much sense but Hauck keeps our attentionand turns this thin conceit into a flesh and bloodperson. Glory Gallo is similarly solid as Frank'swife. They're a testament to the fact that evenunder the most straitened circumstances, talentwill out, even if not all closeted businessmen can
do the same.
