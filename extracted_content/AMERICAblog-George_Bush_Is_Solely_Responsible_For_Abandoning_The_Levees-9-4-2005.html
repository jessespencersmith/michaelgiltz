9/04/2005 03:48:00 PMGeorge Bush is solely responsible for weakening the leveesystem that should have protected New Orleans. Yes, fordecades projects have been on the boards to do a massiverebuilding project. (Total cost? $14 billion, which is exactlywhat we spend in Iraq every six weeks.) Louisiana hasbegged and pleaded for that work to begin and we all shoulderresponsibility for ignoring that obvious need -- you can blameevery President from JFK to Bush for that, not to mention theCongress. But the burden does grow for each succeedingPresident (the longer you wait, the more dangerous it is todelay), so Clinton and Bush are a lot more to blame thanKennedy and Johnson.But beyond that massive project there is the daily hard work ofkeeping the levees in shape. It's tough and unglamorous but ithas to be done. Every President since Nixon understood thatand made sure the levees were strengthened. Every Presidentbut Bush. Bush attacked the levee system with unprecedentedglee. He cut funding for flood protection by 80%. He let mostlyoil and gas companies gobble up the wetlands that act as anatural defense for New Orleans at a rate of 25 square miles ayear.And read this:But the skimping has worsened since President Bush'selection, particularly after September 11. Federal spendingon flood control in south-east Louisiana has been cut byalmost half since 2001, from $69 million per year to $36.5million. Funds for work at Lake Pontchartrain, the source ofthe flooding, have fallen by nearly two-thirds over threeyears, from $14.25 million to $5.7 million. As a result,work on New Orleans' east bank hurricane leveesstopped last summer for the first time in 37 years.Every President since Nixon knew maintaining the levees wasimportant, essential work. But it ground to a halt on Bush's watchbecause he didn't care. Nixon worked to maintain the levees. Fordworked to maintain the levees. Carter worked to maintain the levees.Reagan worked to maintain the levees. Clinton worked to maintainthe levees. Even his own father worked to maintain the levees. ButGeorge Bush abandoned ship. Work on maintaining the levees hadbeen going on for four decades and it ground to a halt on Bush'swatch. Like Cheney, he had "other priorities."George Bush is solely responsible for cutting funds to the marrow andletting levee work grind to a halt last summer for the first time since1968.For most people, the rule is "you break it; you own it." Thanks to hisdereliction of duty, for Bush the rule is clearly "You own it; you breakit."
