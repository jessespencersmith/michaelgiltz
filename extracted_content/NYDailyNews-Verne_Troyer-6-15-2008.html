ctor Verne Troyer yells and curses his way through
the upcoming Mike Myers comedy,.The Love
Guru," as the hard-nosed coach of a Canadian
hockey team. When he isn't bawling out his play-
ers or hitting on the hot owner (JessicaAlba), he's trading
insults with Myers, who tosses little-person insults at the
diminutive actor - and has them all tossed right back at
him with an added spin and a quickpunch to the crotch.
Troye4 best-knowri for his role as Mini-Me in the
'Austin Powers" movies, clearly gives a's good as he gets -
and Myers loves it.
rear-end,c - which is al! you see at your
eye level.
And I say, "Now you know what it's
like" fiaughs] . I just saw a screening two
weeks ago. I didn't know they caught that
on film.
I'm sure people still bring up the reality
show "The Surreal Life,'where you werC
naked and urinating on carnerain the
corner of a weight room.
Yeah, they do. I am tired of it. That's in
the past. I did it and I'm just moving on. I
had understanding and learning from that
gxperience. It was not a great time in my
life. I'm very happy right now. I've changedYou clearly have a very similar and silly
se_nse of humor to Myets" Are there any
iokes you ever object to?
Not really. The way I look at it is, it's a
movie. You've got to be able to have ftln
with it and laugh at it. If it vvere outside
the movie, yeah, some of that stuffwould
be insulting.
Do people in your community ever give
you grief for appearing in a f lm where
Myers refers to you as a Keebler elf, orpretends you're an oscar statue?
Like I said, get over it. I'm sorry; it doesn't
ciffend me. Why should it offend you?My favorite scene in .The love Guru- iswhere Myers, Alba and others come toyour offce for a meeting and it's scaleddown to your size, so they're sitting ontiny couches and their heads scrape theceiling.
We used that set for a lot of interviewsI did, with reporters sitting on the small
couch while I sat at the desk. When I walk
into that room, it's like stepping into a dif-
ferent world.
And you get the last joke in the film: Ina blooper during the end creditg an off-camera voice complains that the cam-era is only showing you and a bunch ofa lot of things. I'm taking care of myself.
You did your firct voiee work for a videogame on Postal lll and you\re been apitchman for the online game World oflitarcraft Are you still really into gaming?
It's hard to stop. The new Grand TheftAuto just came out and I was up fortwodays.
It's been five years since Mike Myers'
last live-action film. Do you ever wish hewouldn't take so long?
I do, as long as I'm in'em. Write some-
thing else!
