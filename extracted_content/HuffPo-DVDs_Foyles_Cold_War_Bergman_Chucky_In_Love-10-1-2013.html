Foyle's  War  is an acclaimed drama about a detective (Michael
Kitchens in the role of a lifetime) who must continue his job on
the home front during World War II when he'd rather be doing
his bit. Of course, you need police even during war so his job is
vital and invariably includes lots of telling crimes (black market,
Nazis and so on) that relate to the war. It was always conceived
to end with the war and to be frank, the show dragged it out a bit and the last season ortwo weren't always up to par. And then, as so often happens, they said goodbye. And
then, as so often happens, they said hello again. It's simply the best thing most everyone
involved with this series has ever done. So they've relaunched the series with Foyle
involved in the Cold War, being drawn into MI5 against his better judgment. Foyle fits
smoothly into this deceptive, who-can-you-trust post-war atmosphere and the series feelsreborn in many ways. It's as good as it's been in many a year. The three TV movies in thisnew season are very strong and set the show up for many seasons to come. They'll need to
stop Foyle from being lied to by his superiors and Foyle unmasking them again and again.
That's run its course even in just three shows. Creator Anthony Horowitz is clearly torn
between calling it a day and ending on a high note (something they failed to do last time)and exploring the fresh new territory. I say, commit to the Cold War, write somesmashing episodes and don't worry about the finish line. Just tell great tells when you canfind them. They have some great new characters and watching Foyle work with themcould be fun. And for heaven's sake, bring back Foyle's son. That wouldn't hurt a bit.
Garnered with Emmys, this TV movie about Liberace is mostly a draw for the
performances of Michael Douglas as the pianist and Matt Damon as his lover. What mighthave been disastrously campy somehow managed to be both serious and fun at the sametime. Candelabra  won't send people scurrying to unearth their old CDs of the performer,
of course. He sure could play but his main gift was showmanship. Some people master theclassical canon. Others prefer to glitter and be gay.
Not since Friday  Night  Lights  has a great TV show collapsed so completely in its second
season. But like Friday  Night  Lights,  Homeland  has a strong enough cast that they have
the ability to find their mojo again. Mind you, the real problem may be that Homeland is
a TV series that really should have been a miniseries. Hopefully, they'll prove me wrong inSeason Three.
Both those shows won tons of Emmys (and Foyle's  War  has been garlanded overseas).
Don't be surprised if a lot of trophys get showered on The  Hollow  Crown  next year. It's a
wildly ambitious miniseries that tackles Shakespeare's history plays with an all-star cast.
Sam Mendes, Richard Eyre and other theatrical heavyweights oversaw the project. JeremyIrons, Tom Hiddleston and Ben Wishaw (as Richard II) star, alongside a bevy of greatslike Patrick Stewart, Simon Russel Beale, Julie Walters, John Hurt -- you get the idea. You
can't swing a stick without hitting a great actor. This monumental work tackles four plays:
Richard  II,  Henry  IV  Parts  I  and  II  and Henry  V, which may cast the longest shadow
since it's been filmed so successfully before. It's airing on PBS right now and will surely beshown in classrooms for years to come. Hey, if kids are trying to cheat and not read the
plays, they could do worse.
Now we know the seventh series is the last for Matt Smith as Doctor Who (he has a few
upcoming specials and then passes the torch at Christmas). It's been a vaguelyunsatisfying final season. His previous one had a major arc running throughout season sixthat was so ambitious and successful that it was inevitable that the next one would pale incomparison unless they raised the stakes again. They didn't. The goodbye to companionsAmy and Rory were a bit abrupt, though in fairness I'm not good with goodbyes. Theholiday special ("The Doctor, The Widow And The Wardrobe" was very weak) and the</p>
<p>mystery of his Impossible Girl was both too built up and not bold enough. They even had
a few genuine clunkers. I don't mean to go overboard. The second half of the season was
solid and Smith held his own throughout. But looking back, I think the decision to bring
in a new Doctor will let Smith walk away with his head held high. They clearly ran out of
steam and nothing jolts the place like a new lead actor. God help Peter Capaldi. So-so final
season or not, Smith is a very hard act to follow.
If you want to catch up on previous Doctors, the special set The  Doctors  Revisited  Fifth
To  Eighth  is one of your most reasonably priced ways into the good Doctor's adventures.
Here you get a solid look at four Doctors (including Peter Davison, who I still think ofimmediately as a vet from All  Creatures  Great  And  Small ) and four complete adventures,
one for each Doc.
Two rare-ish releases round out the Doctor Who titles this week. The  Ice  Warriors  is from
the little mentioned years of Patrick Troughton. The villains in this piece were included
nicely in the season that just ended. This is the first time they appeared. It's rare because
two of the six episodes were apparently lost for good. They've been recreated via so-so
animation and using the original voice soundtracks, a rather clever way to fill in the gaps
that they've used before. In contrast, Scream  of  the  Shalka  was a web only animated series
offering a new adventure of Doctor Who for his 40th anniversary when no live action
series was happening. Richard E. Grant did the voice of the Doctor. He was the ninth todo so, but reboot creator Russell T. Davies really did not like Grant's performance andinsisted Christopher Eccleston was the Ninth Doctor and Grant's animated turn wouldremain outside the official canon, making Grant grist for trivia questions for generationsto come.
The Luther  crime series is notable almost entirely for the electric performance of Idris
Elba. The mysteries and cast surrounding him are fine if familiar, but he raises the quality
by his acting alone. In a crazy bit of over-acting, David O'Hara is a fellow officer whobegins to suspect Luther is responsible for crimes himself. Isn't it suspicious that Lutherseems to show up at so many crime scenes? (Um, well, he's a cop, so...no.) O'Hara delivershis sometimes ludicrous lines at a glacial pace that begins to have its own weirdfascination. Never a great show, but even Elba can't do much with the material here.
Harbor  Command  was a syndicated half hour cop show that aired on TV stations back in
1957. It's standard police stuff -- with a no-nonsense Dragnet vibe -- with one twist: all
the crimes take place at the major seaport of San Francisco. Instead of pulling up in cars,cops are just as likely to pull up in boats. it stars character actor Wendell Corey (RearWindow, The Rainmaker and many others) in the biggest role of his career and he makesthe most of it. Corey is one of those actors made for television; he doesn't try to hard andhis naturalistic style lets the clunky dialogue feel unforced and convincing. I can't imaginemany people were clamoring for the 39 episodes of this show that ended after just oneseason but anyone who was will be very happy. The episodes I looked at were insurprisingly great shape: they look pretty darn terrific. It's just a small hint at the wealthof TV material that's still waiting to be unearthed.</p>
<p>AUTUMN  SONATA  ($29.99 DVD; Criterion)
SLACKER  ($39.99 BluRay; Criterion) --
Autumn Sonata is like one of those rock super groups -- a pairing of two giant talents that
often seems better on paper than in reality. In this case, the reality worked out beautifully,with director Ingmar Bergman making his one and only film with actress Ingrid Bergman.The mother-daughter tale co-starring Bergman's muse Liv Ullmann is tense, dramatic andsubtle. Strong extras include a new interview with Ullmann and a 1981 interview withBergman at the National Theater in London just three years after the film came out.
I can never remember if Slacker  brought the term "slacker" to national attention or just
solidified its meaning once and for all. In any case, this shaggy dog tale by director
Richard Linklater is a master class in how a neophyte director can make the most of hissurroundings. Here Linklater shows a day in the life of Austin, Texas. He eschewed astrong narrative and just created a mosaic of quirky individuals, of which Austin boastsmany. It's a key work of independent cinema though I favor Dazed  And  Confused  as his
real breakthrough. Made for $23,000, it's surely never looked better than on this CriterionBluRay. The marvelous extras include his first film from 1988, a short, three audiocommentaries, casting footage and much more.</p>

Chucky has proven a
surprisingly durable
little</p>
<p>menace, thanks to half a dozen movies that keep making money. Like Frankenstein , the
series started in creepily strong fashion and peaked with the satirical, vicious Bride  Of
Chucky.  The  Complete  Collection  comes out October 8 with all the movies on BluRay, just
in time for Halloween. The comeback film Curse  of  Chucky  is also available on its own
since many fans probably own the last boxed set they put out.
World  War  Z  ultimately proved Brad Pitt's highest grossing film to date. Thank goodness
for him, since this trouble-plagued production had shot up in costs and needed reshoots.
Unfortunately, financial success won't lessen the sting for fans who insist that the clever,
multi-layered novel its based on was turned into a standard issue shoot-em-up.
Halloween  has been released and re-released so many times it's almost silly. If you don't
own it and want to, this Bluray edition will serve you well and includes a new commentary
by John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis. If you do own a good copy already there's noneed to upgrade here. They might consider selling the audio commentary online for a fewbucks so fans who want to hear it don't have to shell out for the movie all over again. Justa thought.
Director John Carpenter made many other films beloved by horror and sci-fi fans and I'm
sure Prince  of  Darkness  has its adherents. But to most of us, this is nonsense, closer to
camp than horror and that ain't good.
Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite actors and it's been unexpected fun to see him getting
a payday by making a string of smart, low-budget horror flicks like The  Purge.  In the near
future, the 99% are allowed one night a year to blow off steam. It's the "purge," a 12 hourperiod when anything goes -- rape, murder, you name it. The rich bunker down in theirmansions; the poor go nuts. Hey, I thought that was what the lottery was for -- to keep usall distracted. Anyway, to me the plot is very similar to an old Star  Trek  episode where
Kirk and Spock end up on a very pleasant planet, only to discover the natives go wildingwhen the sun goes down. Fan reaction was all over the place; critics don't really matter onthis one.
Vincent Price has a great boxed set of his Hammer movies coming out in a few weeks. For
now, you'll have to settle for one of his campier horror flicks. The  Fly  is a nutty film best
remembered for the creepy finale where a half-human, half-fly is trapped in a spider'sweb and squeaking out "Help me! Help me!" It was remade brilliantly by DavidCronenberg and that has simply made the original superfluous in my book. In a similarand far sillier vein is Bela Lugosi's The  Devil  Bat.  You know you're in shaky territory when
even the DVD says the premise of the movie is ludicrous (Lugosi trains vampire bats toattack his enemies and uses after-shave lotion to lure the beasts to his target). Still, Lugosigives his all.
I doubt anyone was more shocked than the filmmakers when the original low-budget
nothing The  Amityville  Horror  became a box office smash. It spun off two sequels and a</p>
<p>remake (so far). All three of the original series are in this BluRay boxed set, with the third
available on BluRay 3-D, though I don't have a TV that lets me judge how well it's done. I
really didn't need a stand-up comic to tell me that anyone who spends more than aminute in a home whose walls are dripping blood and has a voice that moans "Get out!" is
pretty stupid.
Director George Romero's original zombie trilogy stumbled to the finish line with the so-
so Day  Of  The  Dead.  it's simply not up to the standards of the classic Night  Of  The  Living
Dead  or its clever sequel Dawn  Of  The  Dead.  Here military men and a hot female
scientist are holed up in a missile silo while the zombies are rampaging all over the earth.This edition looks great and includes new commentary from Romero along with otherextras.
THE

Classics)THE  KINGS  OF  SUMMER  ($35.99 BluRay;
Sony)IN  THE  HOUSE  ($34.99 BluRay; Cohen Media
Group)PETER  GABRIEL  LIVE  IN  ATHENS1987/PLAY  THE  VIDEOS  ($24.97
BluRayDVD; Real World/Eagle Vision) -- I do</p>
<p>like the mock serious posters for The  Hangover
Part  III.  They're kind of funny. And that's about
it for the final entry in this dim-witted series. Ididn't think much of the original, so you mightprobably tune me out right away. Fans of thatwere pretty defensive about the stupider sequel --
"it wasn't that bad" was the most they could muster. And virtually no one spoke up forthis humor-free Part III. At least it means there won't be a Hangover  IV.  Hey, I'm liking it
better already!
Fill  The  Void  is one of the most popular Israeli films in recent years. It swept the top
awards in that country, won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and was seen around
the world. In it, a young woman is about to be married when her sister dies in childbirth.Suddenly, tradition is demanding that she marry the widowed husband instead of the manshe loves, forcing the girl (Hadas Yaron) to quash her dreams. Despite strong reviews, itslipped through the cracks in the US.
The  Kings  Of  Summer  is a Sundance favorite about four teenage boys who spend a
summer trying to build a cabin in the woods and living off the land. It's Stand By Me,
sans the dead body. It's one of the lucky few films from Sundance to get a theatricalrelease. But bizarrely the movie was rated R, making it inaccessible to a good chunk of itsaudience. Why was it rated R? For "language and some teen drinking," If the MPAAthinks teens haven't heard every word in this movie countless times before, I'd like themto meet my nephews.
Francois Ozon is one of the most exciting directors working today. You wouldn't really
know it because he's so darn prolific. Like Fassbinder, every time you turn around Ozon
has made another movie in another unexpected genre. In this case, it's In  the  House , the
sexy and strange story of a high school student who weasels his way into the home of his
favorite professor with the usual unexpected consequences. It's about the 17th film for the
45 year old French director (notn counting one in the can and one being filmed) and Ican't wait to see what he does next.
Finally, here's a terrific concert film from musician Peter Gabriel. Peter  Gabriel  Live  In
Athens  1987  was directed and edited with care, unusual for most concert films from the
Eighties (and today), where quick edits are the norm. Gabriel is creating more of atheatrical piece than a straight concert here. While it never ascends to the heights of StopMaking Sense, every song is well thought out and choreographed and Gabriel performswith intensity. The BluRay includes the entire three hour concert, which begins with a 40minute set from Youssou N'Dour and Gabriel's headlining show, featuring 16 songs whenGabriel was at the peak of his commercial and artistic powers. Oddly, it's not evenmentioned on the cover, but this release includes a bonus DVD of Play  The  Videos,  the
excellent compilation featuring 23 of his groundbreaking music videos. Apparently it's asop to fans who shelled out for an elaborate boxed set that included this concert but onlyon DVD. This BluRay only release means they have to pay for it all over again in a sense,so the Play DVD is perhaps a "sorry about that" gesture, though of course any fan whobought that massive boxed set surely already owns it. Putting that aside, this is anexcellent concert with great visuals and sound that even casual fans of Gabriel will enjoy.If you don't own Play , that makes this a must-have.</p>
