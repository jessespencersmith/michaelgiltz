Cannes reflects both the movie industry and the world
at large. So it's no surprise that the economic
recession has meant fewer movie posters along the
Croisette, fewer lavish parties and indeed fewer partiesperiod, fewer journalists (with the rise of online
journalists making up for the lack of traditional print
reporters), and indeed fewer stars. On the flip side,that same economic angst has fueled a number offilms, notably Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps
(there's no 2  in the print I saw) and especially Inside
Job by Charles Ferguson, a documentary film about
the Wall Street meltdown that has immediatelyvaulted into everyone's consciousness. It's not in
Competition (god knows why) or everyone would be
calling it the front runner for the Palm d'Or.
With more serious fare and fewer glitzy stars, that means even the streets are a tad more navigable,
which is nice. Running back and forth from cinema to cinema, it's a relief not to always face a mob ofpeople outside the Lumiere. Of course, it's a matter of degree; there are still people everywhere. But if no
Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Brad Pitt, etc means fewer fans to dodge, I won't complain. And even the girls
are friendlier on the streets, without so many parties and billionaires to woo them. Three women perchedon a rail with their backs to the Croisette enjoyed being ogled by every man in sight. When I strolled by
behind them and just smiled politely at their enjoyment over being the center of attention, one of them
leaned back, giggled and tickled my chest as I walked by. No, no, no, she seemed to say in French, youhave to love us too. And I wasn't even in a tux. The recession does have its upside, as every trader will tellyou.

<p>DAY FOUR
ANOTHER YEAR  *** 1/2 out of **** -- Director Mike Leigh -- one of the best working today -- has
fallen into an interesting pattern. A really inspired film is often followed by a smaller, less ambitious one,
a sort of throat-clearing before the next big effort. It's just happenstance, I'm sure; he certainly
approaches every film with dedication and intensity. But there it is: his worldwide hit Secrets & Lies
(1996) was followed by Career Girls;  his atypical but brilliant Gilbert & Sullivan film Topsy-Turvy  (
1999), my favorite, was followed by All Or Nothing;  the piercing Vera Drake  (2004) followed by the
lesser Happy-Go-Lucky . All of them are worthy additions to his CV, but that's my observation and I'm
sticking with it. Besides, it meant I could hotly anticipate Another Year  and that eagerness has been
rewarded with one of the best films of the fest and surely the year. Simply put, we watch a year in the life
of a happily married couple (the great Jim Broadbent and disarmingly natural Ruth Sheen) as Tom andGerri. (Yes.) We see the family and friends in their orbit, all punctuated by the seasons and their work at
the local cooperative vegetable garden. It begins brilliantly with Gerri, a psychiatrist at the local clinic,
talking with a tightly wound Imelda Staunton. Staunton simply wants some sleeping pills because she
hasn't slept well in weeks or even months. Gerri gently probes to find out what the real trouble might be.
("On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your happiness?" asks Gerri. "One," says Staunton brusquely.
"Well, there's a bit of room for improvement there," observes Gerri.) Staunton's character is so vivid, so
wounded and yet defensive that we spend the rest of the movie anticipating her return -- if Judi Dench
can win an Oscar for a brief appearance as the Queen in Shakespeare in Love,  Staunton can win for this
turn. As my friend Stephen pointed out, in a brilliant bit of writing, we see Gerri go home. When her
husband asks about her day and she launches into an anecdote, we immediately expect her to talk aboutStaunton. When she doesn't (Gerri talks about another patient, an alcoholic teacher who showed up
drunk), it lets us know that desperately unhappy people aren't so scarce on the ground. Indeed, the film
is filled with them: their lonely but stable son, then there's the brother of Tom who has lost his wife andbarely knows what to do with himself, an old college pal who is single and grossly overweight and
stuffing himself with potato chips and beer plus many others as well. But above all there's Leslie Manville
-- a Leigh regular -- who plays a co-worker of Gerri's and slowly becomes the heart of the film. She's amess, kindly indulged by Gerri and Tom. Divorced, her big plan is to buy a car, which becomes a cock-
up: it breaks down, she gets lost, piles up ticket after ticket and so on. She's painfully eager in
conversation, awkwardly attracted to their son (who is 10 years her junior and thinks of her as an auntand certainly not a love interest) and just desperate, really. Quietly, masterfully, the film reveals itself:everyone's life is messy and difficult at times, but some people look around and see their friends with
homes and careers and children and just know, just know  that life is passing them by. They're slightly
dazed by the thought and wondering exactly what they did wrong. All these characters are so vivid, it's a
while before you realize who is taking center stage, since any one of them could. Leigh's improvisational
approach to building the script means scene after scene flows naturally, with hilariously awkward
moments following delicately sad ones. And it ends just beautifully, with the sound dropping out and theaudience looking compassionately at the tense and confused face of Manville's character. If you're not
looking at yourself at that point and wondering where your  life went wrong, you should just thank your
lucky stars.
YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER  ** out of **** -- Is it worth seeing? No. At this stage,
as mediocre film follows mediocre film and the bad outnumber the good and threaten his reputation
(which deserves to remain high, no matter how many bad films he makes), I think most fans just want toknow if seeing the new Woody Allen movie will diminish him in their eyes just a tad more or keep his
integrity undimmed. This comedy is too innocuous to tip the scales either way, but if it isn't a net positive
like Match Point , why bother? Why cloud your memory of Annie Hall  and Manhattan  and Husbands &
Wives  and Hannah And Her Sisters  and The Purple Rose Of Cairo  and his other great works from the
70s and 80s with more of the same, only less? Tall Dark Stranger  certainly won't surprise you in the
least. Josh Brolin and Naomi Watts are an unhappily married couple; he's a frustrated novelist (onesuccess, multiple failures) who has a wandering eye; she's an assistant in an art gallery whose sexy new
boss (Antonio Banderas) isn't being nearly forward enough. Anthony Hopkins is her dad, saddling
himself with a dim-witted prostitute turned girlfriend. (At least this time the old man with the young gallooks foolish.) And her mom is the redoubtable Gemma Jones, who comes off best as a womansideswiped by her husband's abandonment but consoled by a faux psychic who promises her that she's in
a glow of triumph and all will work out well. Everyone does their job, a few moments sparkle (a little) and
Freida Pinto (of Slumdog Millionaire ) as Brolin's quite reasonable obsession is ready for a great
Hollywood role. But it's telling that a director so identified with one city doesn't even begin to capture
London here. Clearly, shooting overseas woke Allen up out of his 90s stupor. But this film could be set in
any major city without making the slightest difference and the characters are equally cardboard. Londonshould not feel like Barcelona or New York. It should feel like London . So I don't come to bury Allen or to

and start making them only when he feels truly inspired. He certainly wasn't this time.
SOMOS LO QUE HAY/WE ARE WHAT WE ARE  *** out of **** -- Another film at Directors'
Fortnight and another quality pick. I'm three for three there and that event is clearly having a great year.
What made me pluck this Mexican drama out as one to see? Well, it's "the Mexican cannibal movie" as
everyone describes it, a serious-looking film about a family whose father has suddenly died.
Unfortunately, dad's the one who always procures the people for them to eat and without him around,
the two teenage sons need to step it up. Everyone has a slightly tired look about them (apparently flesh
isn't the most well-rounded of diets) and is edgy and unexpectedly violent. The mother resented thefather for always dabbling with whores, the sister and younger brother seem to have some sexual tensiongoing on and older brother Alfredo (a memorable Francisco Barreiro) may be more bothered about
possibly being gay than being a cannibal. The obvious comparison is Let The Right One In  and it's a good
one: Somos Lo Que Hay  isn't that accomplished but it takes its subject very seriously, even as the film
escalates into some blackly humorous scenes when the family members must awkwardly subdue one of
their victims. (An axe comes in awfully handy right about then.) Their home is wonderfully oppressive(with all the windows blocked and the light a sickly brown) as is every detail overseen by director JorgeMichel Grau. It's probably not violent or "out there" enough for midnight movies nor is it quite successful
enough as a drama for arthouse audiences. But Somos Lo Que Hay  is certainly an impressive, distinctive
debut.
BELLE EPINE  * 1/2 out of **** -- Hmm, a French coming of age tale crossed with a Roger Corman
exploitation flick? Count me in. Belle Epine  doesn't live up to the promise of that build-up unfortunately
as it details a teenage girl mourning the death of her mother just days ago. She takes to shoplifting and
then starts hanging out with the out of control youth who risk their lives racing motorcycles on an
abandoned strip of asphalt every weekend. Our heroine is quite adrift, since her dad is in Canada dealing
with his wife's effects and seemingly paralyzed by grief while her older sister can't bear to even be in thehome. So she's all alone, which means wild parties with the bikers, one of whom happily takes her up on
the offer of sex. It becomes quite silly, eventually, with the biking and "dangerous" scenes played at a
music video level that undercuts the solid performances all around. The two genres don't play off eachother or give each other a fresh spin; they awkwardly coincide and never truly cross-fertilize. Thatintriguing description at the beginning proved too good to be true, just like the idea that foolishly risking
your life or offering yourself up to strangers could make you feel better.
LES AMOURS IMAGINAIRES/HEARTBEATS  ** out of **** -- One of my most highly anticipated
films of the fest is both a mild disappointment and a step forward for its director, Xavier Dolan. He had a
smashing debut last year at Cannes with the blackly humorous drama I Killed My Mother.  It won three
top prizes at the Directors Fortnight and was one of the major hits of the fest. (It went on to acclaim in
Canada and festivals around the world.) This year, his second film played Un Certain Regard, which is
where young filmmakers go on their way up and elder statesmen go on their way down. At this rate,Dolan will be in Competition with a film in the next few years. Let's certainly hope so. His new movie,which has the godawful English title Heartbeats  when The Imaginary Lovers  is far better, is a bisexual
Jules & Jim  with a dash of Wong Kar Wai thrown in for good measure. The movie is interspersed with
people talking about their doomed romances in faux documentary style, with an Almodovar-esque beauty(the actress has a wonderfully angular face) especially memorable. Then we meet best friends Francis
(Dolan) and Marie (Monia Chokri). He's gay and makes little slashes on his bathroom wall every time a
guy turns him down for a relationship (really? 40+ guys wouldn't want him?) and she wears vintageclothing and hangs out with him while they run down everyone in sight. Like a dappled deer, in wanders
Nicolas (Niels Schneider), a tall curly-haired Adonis who loves ingenuously flirting with both of them. He
shares a bed with the two friends -- innocently of course -- and is then surprised when they both developcrushes. The film is a tug of war between the two, with Nicolas either bemused or unaware of their desire.
Mostly it's an excuse for Dolan to develop his skills as a filmmaker.  I Killed My Mother was accomplished
and had some nice framing of its characters but was by and large dialogue driven. Les Amours
Imaginaires  is a huge leap forward stylistically with Dolan telling much of the story through visuals. He
goes a bit overboard, with some scenes playing like music videos, and his choice of classical music cues
are far more cliched than his taste in pop. But if he's to become a great filmmaker, these are exactly the
sort of talents he needs to develop. Dolan and Chokri are inherently appealing but the audience shouldbe given more reason to care for them; they're so busy being sour and dissing each other that we don't get
to warm up to them like we should. The eye candy of Nicolas should just be an excuse for them to spar as
only friends can. And Dolan uses the Wong Kar Wai trick of repeating a pop song over and over and overagain but only proves how difficult that can be to pull off. He also finds the perfect ending -- a nice visual
moment -- only to tack on a coda that is thoroughly unnecessary. The movie looks great but seems to

is also acting in other films -- will continue making movies at a furious pace and keep pushing himself to
grow artistically. He's got a great film in him and perhaps a great career as well.
DAY FIVE
To prepare for the deluge of movies at Cannes, I try to read as many books as possible. Huh? That is, I
try to read any books that movies are based on or, failing that, any books about the subject the film
covers. That means I read Valerie Plame's Fair Game, since her memoir is the basis for a drama starring
Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. A French film about atrocities in Algeria led me to A Savage War Of Peace
by Alaine Horne, the definitive account of France's final days in that troubled colony. Wall Street: Money
Never Sleeps  and the documentary Inside Job (about the financial meltdown) convinced me to lug The
Big Short  by Michael Lewis, Fools Gold  by Gillian Tett and House Of Cards  by William D. Cohan. You get
the drift. So another French film -- this one about Cistercian monks slaughtered in 1996 (in Algeria, noless) -- led me to another book. And that explains why I am surely the only person in the entire world
who will be lining up for Gregg Araki's super-gay apocalyptic college sex comedy Kaboom  while reading
The Cistercian World: Monastic Writings Of The Twelth Century.  People in line would glance at the
book, get a very puzzled look on their face and then turn their backs. Not a conversation starter,
apparently. I knew I should have brought Michel Foucault instead.
LA PRINCESSE DE MONTPENSIER  ** out of **** -- In keeping with my book theme, I'll mention
that I'd never read the novels of Madame De Lafayette. Rather than reading this one, I purchased her
masterpiece The Princess Of Cleves.  Considered the first modern French novel (it dates from 1678), the
novel demonstrates LaFayette's subtlety and focus on ethics and mores rather than heaving bosoms. But
this film of her other great novel, by director Bertrand Tavernier, has no subtlety or charm or wit. It's
flatly obvious as we follow a princess forced to marry one (rather jealous) man but in love with a dashingcompetitor and inspiring love in her spouse's older mentor. Swords flash, with Christian wars as a
backdrop for her passion. We're told the Princess has rejected her lover and come to appreciate her
husband (quite a winning fellow, actually) but then it's back to the lover and the film is too simple for usto know whether she genuinely changed her mind again and again or was dissimulating. The same is truefor all the characters so instead of the devious, thrilling intrigue of Dangerous Liaisons,  we just follow
the surface action without ever really knowing or caring about who really loves whom.
ARMADILLO  ** 1/2 out of **** -- A fine Danish documentary this follows a group of soldiers on a six
month tour of Afghanistan. The director's statement said the film was about the addiction of war. Clearly,
he came in wanting to understand why anyone would choose to go to a war zone, especially people asnominally involved in the politics of the US occupation of Afghanistan as young Danish men. Happily,
the film evinces no such agenda. We follow the guys as they're tearfully hugged goodbye and then endure
months of boredom. Many scenes are depressingly familiar, with local Afghanis caught between soldierswho show up during the day and the Taliban who show up at night. The men reinforce the idea ofsoldiering as frat boys with guns: they party, call each other gay, wrestle around, watch a lot of porn and
do public service -- in this case serve their country with diligence. It's only late in the film when we
witness two firefights and the filmmakers are so clearly in danger that we become frightened for them.The rush of actually facing the enemy (the soldiers are worried they'll go home without being tested in
battle) is clearly the key as far as the filmmaker is concerned. Their actions on the field, which may be
callous by civilian standards (they boast about their actions, joke about the enemy dead) seem perfectlyreasonable. But in the film one soldier's mother calls in to complain about his description of the eventsand an investigation is launched that peters out. Now, with the release of the film, a new investigation
has been launched into whether anyone behaved inappropriately. What's no surprise is that about half
the men re-up. I think it's not that momentary rush a la The Hurt Locker  but more the camaraderie and
sense of genuine purpose they have. Perhaps most striking is the film's strong visuals under very difficult
conditions. The material is too similar to other documentaries to recommend it, but it's a solid work
nonetheless.
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO  * 1/2 -- The most entertaining moment of this documentary about nuclear
proliferation is when the first talking head pops up: it's Valerie Plame, the CIA agent who specialized in
this issue. Right wingers who demonize her will learn she's always been smarter and more hawkish about
the threats around the world than they'd like to admit. That was about it for me. A perfectly competent
movie, it tells us remarkably banal facts: nuclear weapons can cause a lot of damage, major powers likethe US and Russia have at times almost launched them, accidents and mistakes continually happen and if
you want some enriched uranium of course you should head for the former Soviet Union. Other than
middle school students who grew up post Cold War, it's hard to imagine most people not knowing andagreeing with these facts. People may not know the number of countries that officially have nuclearweapons (9, if you count Israel) or the number of weapons out there (around 16,000), but there's
precious little beyond a few vivid anecdotes to engage adults. The cause is impeccable (of course, there's aFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST</p>

INSIDE JOB  *** 1/2 out of **** -- What a difference a screening makes! From a banal examination of a
compelling international issue we go to a wonderfully illuminating documentary about an especially
complex topic.  Inside Job  is unquestionably the most important film that will play at Cannes and
hopefully can arouse people into forcing legal action to be taken against those who have so clearly brokenthe law and swindled the taxpayers and citizens out of literally hundreds of millions of dollars. Inside Job
is a relentless, accurate and highly entertaining look at the financial meltdown. Director Charles Ferguson
clearly maps out the origins of the crisis, how it could have been prevented, how it could have been
lessened, where the bodies are buried and who buried them. From Elliot Spitzer to a spokesman for thefinancial industry on Wall Street, from France's head of finance to guys living in tents in Florida,Ferguson went everywhere and spoke to everyone willing to talk. (He also has a ball noting when people
refused to talk, typically after a damning fact in the film about them is driven home.) it's like a Michael
Moore movie without the light touch that can allow some people to dismiss the substance of what is said.
No one can dismiss this film; Ferguson is too thorough, too specific. Interview after interview, he politely
makes people squirm. If the result is not even sterner reforms from Congress than those pushed byObama to wholesale ethics reform on our college campuses, the only one we can blame is ourselves.Ferguson has done his part.
KABOOM  *** OUT OF **** -- I should probably give this film 2 1/2 stars out of four but sometimes you
have to be honest and just admit you had a blast, whatever a movie's flaws. In this case, the movie is
Gregg Araki's totally ridiculous apocalyptic, end of the world, cult crazy, lesbian witch, fluid orientation
college sex comedy. Yeah, I enjoyed it. The movie marries the absurdist, out there scenarios of his earlywork with the formal mastery of his masterpiece Mysterious Skin and the stoner flick Smiley Face.  The
result is queer-friendly, polished fun. It stars Thomas Dekker of TV's Heroes  and Terminator: The Sarah
Connor Chronicles  as Smith, a gay-ish college student who considers his orientation "undeclared."
(Labels are so 90s.) In an homage to Risky Business,  it starts with a dream. Typically for Araki, when
Smith is naked by God he's fully naked and in the end he spots...a red trash container. Huh? Don't worry.
It all soon spirals into a sexual cornucopia of a surfer roommate who digs chicks but wants to self-fellate,
a female best friend trying to dump a vengeful sexy witch, a disappearing girl, another girl who booty callshim every five minutes...oh, and a massive cult that may spell the end of the world, thus dooming Smithfrom having a date with an actually sane guy who met him at a party. Someone called it The CW on acid
and it's hard to get that description out of my head. If it sounds up your alley, it is. If it sounds a little
dicey for your tastes, Kaboom  won't win you over with subtlety. It's a nutty, silly ride. Oh and for those
who were bitterly disappointed that Dekker's gay character on Heroes  was turned straight and then
dumped from the show, you can discover that revenge (in this case his role here) is sometimes a dish bestserved hot. And sexy.

Michael, 
Great inside look at Cannes and the movies. Enjoyed your look at how the people and the town are
different since the meltdown, especially the girl tickling your chest. Can't wait to see Inside Job. 
But I have to ask, where are your priorities , man? You choose to be at Cannes instead of watching
American Idol? A couple of good movies instead of seeing Casey going home to Cool, Texas. I'm
guessing, of course, and we won't know for a few more minutes. He could surprise; the girls lovehim and he's likable enough. But he didn't seem to try very hard last night. Lee killed; maybe thebest singing of the season. And Crystal was quite good. 
But I confidentl y predict that Lee, Crystal, and Casey will comprise the Bottom Three tonight. 
Tell France hi for me. And thanks for covering Cannes. I'd hate to be there when I can sit here
instead and watch TV. ;- )
