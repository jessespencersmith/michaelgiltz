Burnett  And  More
What's going on? Why have even more TV shows been pouring onto DVD and BluRay
lately? And not just full season offerings but elaborate boxed sets of entire runs of shows?A couple things. DVD sales are slowing but the one area of strength is TV shows; peoplemay not bother to purchase every movie that comes out on DVD anymore, but they see alot of value in buying an entire season of a show they like. So if that's where the money is,that's where studios will focus their energy. Plus, it's a lot easier to sell a digital downloadof a movie as opposed to 12 or 20 episodes of a show. So again, when it comes to TV,consumers like BluRay and DVDs. Finally, all the studios believe physical copies of moviesand TV shows are a thing of the past. Paramount even handed off a chunk of its valuablelibrary to Warner Bros. and said, we can't be bothered putting them out on DVD andBluRay. (They kept the digital rights.) In a few years, they imagine everyone will eitheraccess streaming video via Netflix, Hulu and the like or just buy a digital copy.
So for all these reasons it's a mad dash to cash in while the getting is good. So fans of
classic TV get to dig into lavish sets devoted to The  Fugitive  and The  Carol  Burnett  Show
and Poirot  and Peter  Gunn  and on and on. Here's hoping studios and music unions (one
of the big roadblocks keeping certain shows off of DVD because of high royalty demands)wise up and cut deals so we can finally see shows like The  Wonder  Years,  I'll  Fly  Away,Hill  Street  Blues  and (fill in the name of your favorite TV show missing on DVD) come out
on disc while they still can. Here's a rundown of some terrific sets that came out just inthe last two or three weeks. It's impossible to put them in order of preference: many ofthese are gems we've been waiting a long time for.
THE  FUGITIVE:  THE  MOSTWANTED  EDITION  ($259.98 DVD;
Paramount) -- Here's a classic example ofa TV show held off the market or released
poorly in the past with substitute music
cues. (That's why you don't see The
Wonder  Years  or many variety shows on
DVD much; the royalties for musicbecome insanely prohibitive even though
the result is that the shows aren't seen foryears and no one makes any money. I'mall for a fair price but for too long musicrights holders have been stubborn andshort-sighted.) The  Fugitive  is an
anthology show disguised as a drama.Like Route  66,  the vagabond Richard
Kimble (David Janssen) would come into town, right a wrong or make friends and thenhead off into the night, with the determined Lt. Gerard hot on his heels. The music of

<p>composer Dominic Frontiere was a key element in the show and it's almost all included
here. (Apparently something  is still missing -- maybe a song on a jukebox they couldn't
clear? -- but most of the cues are original.) And they do right this time with a rare and
welcome focus on Frontiere and his contributions to the show, down to a bonus CDsoundtrack. The packaging is very attractive if you want to display it. Better still, theslipcase contains all four seasons in standard sized cases that will fit neatly on your shelfif you want to file them alongside all your other shows. It's a bit pricey (though it worksout to just $2 an episode, that's still a lot for such a vintage series), but the quality of thetransfer throughout is top-notch. Loads of extras. This is how it's done.
MAD  MEN  SEASON  FIVE  ($44.98
DVD; Lionsgate) -- Don Draper couldteach Richard Kimble a thing or twoabout going on the lam and crafting anew identity. I've been waiting andwaiting for people to come to their sensesand realize the emperor has no clothes onthis show to no avail. I've been deeplyunhappy with the creative direction of
this show from season two on and now I
just "hate watch" it to yell in frustration
when they undermine good characterswith idiotic plot twists. Season Five wasthe worst by far and yet few others seem
to care. Don is cursed with wives played
by actresses who can't act. Peggy (the
heart of the show) is shunted off to the side even though every time she's given a scene the
show is immediately far more interesting. Joan Harris has resisted using her sex appeal to
advance her career throughout her life and proven herself invaluable to the firm thanks toher smarts and know-how...only to trade sex for advantage. Really? After all these years?
We pop into a minor character's travails over writing which haven't been referenced in
years  and are supposed to care? Really? And on and on and on. It's a very talented cast
and the intelligence and craft is there. But the scripts are dreadful and getting worse.
ALL  IN  THE  FAMILY  COMPLETE
SERIES  ($199.99 DVD; Shout Factory) -
- This show can still take your breathaway with its bluntness and truth-telling.I honestly don't know if it would be airedon network TV today. Yes, it pushed theenvelope but not in vulgarity andcrudeness as such, but in honesty abouthow people talked. It's genius was not tomake Archie the butt of all jokes, anignorant fool constantly shown up by theliberal Meat Head Michael. He often wasthis, very often. But Archie was a humanbeing. Sometimes he actually won anargument or more accurately left Michaelsputtering for a response even though
Michael knew (and we knew) Archie was wrong. Sure the show grew softer and Archiebecame more irascible and lovable than the sometimes ugly-minded bigot he began as.But that was seven or eight seasons in, or on the continuation of the show Archie  Bunker'sPlace  (which thank God is not included here). This is the complete nine seasons of the
original series (surely three or four too many) and the first four or five are still potentstuff. You can see the show appreciating the impact it was having and starting to make"points" with its storylines, such as the attempted rape of Edith, all to the show's ultimatedetriment. At its best, the main point of the series was to show a modern family dynamicin all its finger-pointing, name-calling, you drive me nuts but we're stuck with each otherreality. It put a face on ignorance and bigotry not merely to disarm it or mock it butsimply to see it for what it was; they didn't demonize Archie but they didn't downplay his</p>
<p>nastiness either. And it was hilariously funny to boot, especially early on. This nicely
compact set has everything you'd want, including all 208 episodes solidly remastered,
retrospectives, pilots for the direct spin-offs and more. It's a landmark series in everyway.
PETER  GUNN  THE  COMPLETE
SERIES  ($99.99 DVD; Timeless) --
Another ground-breaking series, this is
one I've heard about more than I've seen.It's great to finally get a chance to dive in.The pilot -- written and directed by showcreator Blake Edwards -- has to be one ofthe all-time great pilots in TV history. Ina tight, half hour, it sets up our coolprivate eye hero (Craig Stevens), the jazzclub where he hangs out, the girl singer(Lola Albright) he dates AND creates andsolves a mystery at the same time. It'sintelligent, adult, sexy as all get out andnoir to the hilt; as good as many a solidnoir film. The picture and sound were
solid in the pilot. I dipped into episodes throughout the rest of the three seasons andthey're not all as pristine -- there's a notable background hiss on some -- but it's quitewatchable and this is the best we're going to get. I assume the solving of crime in the blinkof an eye will get repetitive (and the girl apparently has a habit of always showing upduring a shoot out) but it's fun fare and far superior to most of its era. The bonus ismainly a CD of that great score by Henry Mancini.
THE  CAROL  BURNETT  SHOWULTIMATE  COLLECTION($199.95 DVD; Time Life) -- I
recently reviewed a six DVD set of
Carol's Favorites that came out. But if
you're really a fan of this variety show
(which I grew up on Saturday nights),
you're undoubtedly pleased that thosemusic rights issues which kept theshow truncated in syndication and off
the market in proper form for so long have been resolved. This mega-set contains 50 ofthe show's best episodes on 22 DVDs, along with commentary, reunion specials and thelike. I'm not a fan of big bulky sets that can only sit on a coffee table or take up an entireshelf in your library. This one is especially awkward with a thick carboard "curtain" youhave to yank up to reveal the DVDs inside. Happily, they're all in standard sized cases youcan line up on your shelf alongside other shows. The remastered episodes look great andit's a blast to realize how embedded even the dance numbers are in my memory. (I mustadmit the song and dance numbers often came at the end of each episode and I drifted offto sleep sometimes when I knew no more skits were coming; hey, I was a kid.) It's a pitywonderful talent like Bernadette Peters and Sammy Davis Jr. often lip-synced toprerecorded tracks but that doesn't take away from the appeal of their vocals. And theheart of the show is the intro by Carol and the skits, all of which you know well. It'sstartling to see again how dark the "Family" skits became. (It was more Edward Albeethan Neil Simon by the end.) But skit after skit still appeals because they were such awarm ensemble and loved nothing more than to make each other laugh. I said it beforeand I'll say it again: it has the appeal of community theater where you watch old friendsperform in shows and have a rooting interest in how they do. Of course here our "oldfriends" are talented TV stars we've never actually met. But did any other variety showever feel so approachable and down to earth despite the major talent on display? Carol</p>
<p>chose the episodes to include herself and she's a crowd-pleaser so it's probable most of
your favorites are here. I know mine are. Available direct from Time Life.
POIROT:  THE  EARLY  CASES
COLLECTION  ($249.99 BluRay; Acorn)
-- We're approaching the grand finale ofPoirot , one of the most ambitious and
successful TV mystery shows in history.Star David Suchet has made AgathaChristie's prickly Hercule Poirot entirelyhis own. Despite a brief scare withcancellation, Suchet's desire to essentiallyfilm every single Poirot short story andnovel is coming to fruition with the 13thand final series that is filming right now,including Poirot's final case from thenovel Curtain . In the UK, series 1-12 have
been sold as a boxed set. Here, since weknow a final series is coming, Acorn has
opted for two complementary boxed sets. Here we have Series 1-6 with 45 mysteries in all,
including hour long episodes and feature length adventures, all very smartly remastered
and available in their original UK broadcast order and length. (Too often for AmericanTV, we see snipped episodes of Poirot  and Foyle's  War  and the like with minutes trimmed
off to fit the time slot. Not here.) The chance to see them all in order and watch Suchet
sharpen and refine his performance is one I'm relishing, especially since for some bizarre
reason I missed the train when this all began and only saw the show in bits and pieces
here and there. He'll surely rank with Jeremy Brett's Holmes as one of the great TVadaptations of all time. Find out how great starting here and now.
FANTASY  ISLAND  COMPLETETHIRD  SEASON  ($39.97 DVD; Shout) -
- Not every TV series from the past is agem. Most aren't. But few are as puzzling
today as a show like Fantasy  Island.  Why
oh why did we watch this anthology
series? It began as a lame-brained showvaguely set in reality: people paid for theprivilege of coming to Fantasy Island andgetting some wish fulfillment that couldbe arranged for a price. But by the thirdseason the show -- always bad -- becameludicrous as hints of Mr. Roarke's magicalpowers and godlike abilities becameincreasingly common and the fantasiesleft reality (I wanna be a cowboy!) to
absurd heights. An easy paycheck for faded stars, Fantasy  Island  did frequently have the
benefit of guest stars better than the material. More often, everyone deserved each other.
UPSTAIRS  DOWNSTAIRS  SEASONTWO  ($34.98 DVD; BBC) -- It would
have been hard enough for this drama toget out from under the shadow of theclassic 1970s series it sprang from. (Thatshow is one of the all-time greats.) Butthis edition had the extra stumbling blockof Downton  Abbey , a cheerful rip-off of
the original Upstairs  Downstairs  that
stole its thunder. They might have foundtheir own voice with season two butdisaster struck repeatedly. Jean Marsh(the star and co-creator of the original)</p>
<p>was the key link to the past and she
suffered a stroke. Eileen Atkins (the otheroriginal creator) took a pass, unhappy
with where the new team led by Heidi Thomas was taking her character. The result is atruncated season that was cancelled and so couldn't even muster a proper farewell. Still,it's worth checking out the entire two seasons to see what might have been and imaginethe reception for it if those tarts at Downton  Abbey  hadn't thrown themselves at the
masses.
THE  DUCHESS  OF  DUKE  STREET($79.99 DVD; Acorn) -- The real spiritualheir to Upstairs  Downstairs  was this
marvelous series by that show's mainstay
producer John Hawkesworth. He created
this drama based on the true story of a
scullery maid who became the mostfamed chef in London and proprietor of a
classy hotel, Cockney accent and all. It
was the role of a lifetime for Gemma
Jones who made the most of it. You get
all 31 episodes in this compact edition.
Anyone who is a fan of Upstairs  or
Downton  should jump immediately.
TOUCH  COMPLETE  FIRST  SEASON($49.98 DVD; Fox) -- If you're like me,you can be wary of committing to a newTV series. If that's what held you back onTouch , the new drama from the creator
of Heroes , you can rest easy that season
two begins in January on FOX. KieferSutherland stars as the father of a littleboy who has mysterious powers. Week toweek, Sutherland gets involved inmysteries that connect disparate people inunexpected and life-changing ways a laBabel  and other movies with cross-
current plots that tie together nicely bythe end. Sutherland is in fine form,tempering his Jack Bauer drive with moresensitivity and heart here.PSYCH  SEASON  SIX  ($59.98 DVD;
Universal) CASTLE  SEASON  FOUR  ($45.99
DVD; Buena Vista) -- Sometimes I don'twant my TV to be ground-breaking andenvelope-pushing and filled with zombiesand elaborate backstories. Sometimes I</p>
<p>just want to zone out with comfort food of
the TV variety, a pleasing series withamiable characters that can gently
entertain me for an hour. Enter fun
shows like Psych  and Castle . Psych  is
surely nearing the end of its run but the
faux psychic Sean (James Roday) and hisfriend Gus (Dule Hill) remain goodcompany as they solve crimes in jokey,teasing fashion. Castle  is in better shape
since it's only on its fourth season andstar Nathan Fillion is as addictive ascatnip. (If Hollywood still made 'em likethey used to, he'd be a movie star.) Eithershow is a very dependable source ofentertainment. They don't win awards orrock the world, but every once in a whilethat's exactly what you need.
WISH  ME  LUCK  COMPLETE
COLLECTION  ($79.99 DVD; Acorn) --
World War II is a seemingly endlesssource of fascinating material for books,movies, and tv shows. Take this littleknown British series from the late 1980s.Based on true stories, of course, it's aboutwomen trained to serve as spies inEngland then dropped into Occupied
France to work alongside the French
Resistance, every minute of every day a
test of their nerve and resolve. It's a
corker of a set up and the three seasons
offered here nicely follow the war from itsearly days to D-Day so there's a solid
feeling of completeness in the 23
episodes. The cast is very strong but since
none of them were major stars, the senseof jeopardy remains paramountthroughout.THE  ERNIE  KOVACS  COLLECTIONVOLUME  TWO  ($29.93 DVD; Shout) --
The early days of television was a free-for-all. No one knew anything so,technically, there were no rules to bebroken. But if there had  been any rules,
Ernie Kovacs would have surely been thefirst to do so. Volume Two of hispioneering antics that have influencedeveryone from David Letterman to JonStewart includes all sorts of material Ithought you'd have to go to a museum tosee in an archive (if you were lucky). We</p>
<p>get eight more episodes from his anarchic
morning show, three episodes of his"gameshow" (Groucho has nothing on
Kovacs), an interview with this maverick, a pilot for a series starring Buster Keaton (!) andbonus sketches from here, there and everywhere. A true original.
