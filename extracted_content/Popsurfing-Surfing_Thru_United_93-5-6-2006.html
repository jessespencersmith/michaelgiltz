            <p>Newer PostOlder PostS AT U R D AY,  M AY  0 6 ,  2 0 0 6Surfing Thru "United 93"I wanted to see it. I needed to see it. (For work.) But I kept sort ofavoiding it, even though I didn't expect the movie to bother meemotionally beyond whatever the movie itself might achieve. But it did.And it was certainly the quietest New York audience I've been aroundat a movie theater in a long time, if ever. Not a sound from anyone frombeginning to end. Director Paul Greengrass did a terrific job -- nosurprise since his "Bloody Sunday" was an exceptional look at the Irishtroubles that felt so authentic you wondered if it was a documentaryand his "Bourne Supremacy" proved he had a way with action andviolence. It was matter of fact, moving and sad. I don't ever need to see"Mission: Impossible" again because it moved me so little. I don't everwant to see "United 93" again because it moved me so much.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Thanks. Bloody Sunday is very good and certainly not as wrenching asUnited 93 because we have less emotionally invested in the topic(assuming you're not living in Ireland).12:34 PM
