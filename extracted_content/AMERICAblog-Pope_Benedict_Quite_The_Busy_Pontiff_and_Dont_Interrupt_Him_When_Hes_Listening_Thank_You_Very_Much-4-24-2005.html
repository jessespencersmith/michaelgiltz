4/24/2005 12:15:00 PMThe New York Times has a lengthy, nuanced article about the'68 student revolt in Europe and how it radically shaped thethinking of the future Pope Benedict XVI. It's well worthreading for anyone who wants to learn more about Ratzingerand what makes him tick.However, maybe we can learn more from a Washington Postarticle. Hilariously headlined "Pope Wants Dialogue" on themain web page, it describes the Pope's first meeting withreporters. Yes, the Pope who wants dialogue:...sat on a gilt throne in a large auditorium and read astatement of thanks in Italian, German, French and English,but took no questions. When John Paul was elected pope in1978, he first met with reporters inside the tight confines ofthe Clement Room in the Apostolic Palace, took questionsand mingled with journalists....Benedict lectured the journalists on the need to possess"clear references of the ethical responsibilities" and toengage in a "sincere search for the truth and thesafeguarding of the centrality and the dignity of theperson." Vatican TV broadcast not only his speech, but alsothe images of a line of clerics as they approached the pope,knelt and kissed his hand.Now that's dialogue. Bush must be jealous. The British, as always,weren't afraid to be caustic and noted a cultural snub that passed bythe Americans. The Independent's reporter quoted the Pope assaying:Only by a "sincere search for the truth and the safeguardingof the centrality and dignity of the human being" can themedia "fulfil the purpose of God, who has put them at ourdisposal."So that was clear. We assembled in the Paul VI Hall,Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs,Buddhists, Don't Knows and None of the Aboves, tofulfil God's purpose - if we were doing our jobsproperly, that is.Benedict took no questions, unlike his predecessor,who fielded them for 40 minutes at his first pressencounter. And the new Pope shocked Spaniards andLatin Americans in the audience by reading his briefmessage in Italian, English, French and German, butnot in the language of half the Catholic world: somewondered if this might be an oblique rebuke to Spain'sPrime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, forgiving Spain's homosexuals the right to marry -condemned by a top Vatican official this week as "aniniquitous law" - so painfully soon after the papalelection.Again, nothing like dialogue, an open heart and snubbing half theworld's Catholics with your first press conference. Finally, this may bethe most shocking news of all: Pope Benedict XVI supposedly reachedout to the Anglican Church by inviting the Archbishop of Canterburyto attend his formal acceptance of the pontificate. But behindWilliams' back, according to the Times of London, Benedict has been
