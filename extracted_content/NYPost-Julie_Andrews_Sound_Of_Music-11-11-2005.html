            <p>'The Sound of Music' is 
40 years old, yet star Julie 
Andrews says her prim 
image refuses to die 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
JULIE Andrews is professionally polite and 
chipper. Even if she hadn't starred in 1965's 
"The Sound, of Music" and 1964's 
"Mary Poppins" 
-two of the most ---~~-
delightful and whole­
some musicals of all 
time -it's easy to believe she'd still be seen as 
proper and very well behaved. . 
So if you're hoping Oscar-winner Andrews 
will dish dirt on her co-stars, you hope in vain. 
Our image of the 70-year-old Andrews is these 
roles, even though she's worked consistently 
ever since. Recent hits include "Shrek 2" and the 
upcoming "Shrek 3" (she voices a queen), "The 
Princess Diaries" fJ1ms (ditto), the TV movies 
based on the "Eloise" books, and her own line of 
best-selling children's books. 
But Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp keep 
demanding her attention. "Poppins" has just 
been turned into a critically acclaimed stage 
musical in London, which will likely hit New 
York in 2006. And "The Sound of Music" is out 
on DVD Nov. 15 in a new deluxe set (Fox; $26.98) 
bursting with commentaries, new documen­
taries and, of course, Andrews. 
"The Sound of Music" was an overwhelming hit. 
Were you bored by the goody-goody image. ? 
It ain't true. I knew at the time how lucky I was 
to get the role. I think the press made a lot about 
my squeaky-clean image and my wanting to 
tweak it. I think it bothered the press more. 
So 1981's ''S.O.8.'' (your husband Blake Edwards' 
scabrous valentine to Hollywood in which you 
bared your breasts) wasn't meant to shock us ? 
Blake wrote "S.O.B.," and he knows me very 
well It was a fimny idea There's nothing wrong with tweaking your image every once in a while. 
It's nothing I get uptight about, I assure you. 
I suppose it's only fair people tease you for that 
wholesome image since you mocked "1be Sound 
of Musie in one of your concerts with carol Bur­
nett before you'd even been cast in the film. The 
footage we see on the DVD extras of you perf0rm­
ing "From Switzerland: The 
Plat Family" is funny. 
[Laughs] I had no idea 
I'd be playing the role at 
that point and was a bit nervous 
about it when they started to consider 
me. Carol and I are talking about doing a ret­
rospective on those concerts. Sort of a best-of. 
One other big myth surrounding "The Sound of 
Music" is that you and Christopher Plummer 
despised each other during the filming. He's very 
frank in the new documentary on the DVD, admit­
ting he thought at the time the movie was beneath 
him. He also says he behaved snobbishly and 
rather poorly on the set. So isn't it true? 
No. We were friends even before we went on 
the set. We'd-been friends from the Broadway 
stage, but it certainly cemented the friendship. 
We've worked together since, and we send each 
other notes and go to see each other's shows, and 
it's a very lovely friendship. 
You were confused by the lyrics to "I Have C0nfi­
dence." Your decision to play it as babbling non­
sense -Maria will say anything to convince her­
self she's not scared -comes across perfectly. 
The lyrics were complicated, and I wasn't 
quite sure what they meant. "Strength lies in 
nights of peaceful sillmber?" I had a real, "Hmro, 
what am I supposed to be doing" moment. It 
actually helped the scene. I did the best I could. 
Many fans of the movie know the field in that 
opening shot where you sing the title song isn't 
reaDy that accessible on foot. Tourists who go 
there have to take a troIley-car ride. But I had no 
idea that the helicopters used to capture those 
sweeping first images came so close that you were 
getting battered to the ground again and again. 
Yes. It was fimny and ironic. You see this love­
ly shot on mm, but I'm getting pummeled.</p>
