9/27/2004 03:04:00 AMHowever, when the US behave unilaterally, it ignores international lawand invades another country (and breaks with the Geneva Conventionin the process). When Britain behaves unilaterally, it decides to payoff 10% of the the debt of the Third World.Specifically, the New York Times reports that "Britain will set asidethe equivalent of $180 million a year to pay off 10 percent of themoney owed by 32 countries to international lenders, notably theWorld Bank and the African Development Bank. Poor nations contendthat they often must choose between paying these debts and meetingurgent needs of their people, or making expenditures that wouldstrengthen their economies."This move was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,Gordon Brown, who would love to unseat Tony Blair as head of theLabor Party (and thus become Prime Minister). So maybe this is somecynical political ploy. But isn't it lovely to picture politicians trying toout-manuever each other in helping Third World countries get ontheir feet economically? Instead of just blowing them up?
