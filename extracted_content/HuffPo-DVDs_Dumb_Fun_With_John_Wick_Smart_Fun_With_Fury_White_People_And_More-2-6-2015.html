The best part of January and February for DVD and BluRay (and streaming) buffs? The fact that all the bigaward season contenders come flooding into your home. It's probably the best time of the year for hardcore filmbuffs who don't live near an arthouse cinema or just prefer to screen their flicks at home -- just like studio mogulsand all the Academy members who choose the Oscars, by the way. Here's a rundown of big recent titles sincethe beginning of 2015.JOHN WICK ($39.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)There are good movies and bad movies and movies so bad you sort of enjoy them anyway. But there's anothercategory, the sort that B movies and drive-in movies specialized in for a while. These are knowing movies -- notcamp or movies intentionally so stupid that they'd hope you laugh. But the sort of guilty pleasure movies thatdove into genre with unrestrained glee. They weren't striving for greatness and unlike some B movies, theyknew even a certain underground greatness that might be recognized decades later wasn't in the cards. They'rejust good dumb fun. And here we have John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves as some sort of hired killer who haswalked away from the game. Then some random bad guys give him a tough time at a gas station. When he isn'tfazed, they invade his home, beat the crap out of him...and kill his puppy. You don't kill a man's puppy. Not aman like John Wick. All hell breaks loose, with massive gun fights and fisticuffs staged like a video game and somany shots of Wick shooting people in the head it could become a drinking game of dangerous proportions. It'sall patently absurd and if you're in the right mood, unmitigated joy.THE PALM BEACH STORY ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VAN KANT ($29.95 DVD; Criterion)For sheer, dizzying pleasure, it doesn't get any better than writer-director Preston Sturges. The Palm BeachStory comes right at the height of his powers. In the past, I've seen some weak prints of the film and it sure</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=0a09fbc0-7dff-4fdc-9cdd-44821d8b4156&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&2/6could use a complete restoration. But here Criterion has delivered the strongest visual presentation I've seen ofthe movie so far -- not quite a complete rebirth but much more convincing. Sometimes on TV I've been worriedthe movie might fade away before my eyes. Not here, so you can relish the absurdity of the plot with twins anddouble weddings and a nutty old coot worth millions and so much more. I've never quite understood how JoelMcCrae does it. Some actors are just "present" and always convincing, like Spencer Tracy. Others act theirbums off, like Marlon Brando. McCrae is sort of convincingly unconvincing -- whether in a comedy or drama healways seems at a slight remove from the action. And yet you buy him, even if he's telling you it's all a load ofbunk. Whatever it is, I'm crazy about it and the more I see of McCrae the more I appreciate him as one of thegreats. Claudette Colbert, I get. She's beautiful, a great actress and has the comic timing of a master. Of courseevery man falls for her; they're only human after all. What a joy this film is and if you've never seen it you're in fora treat. This set includes the usual extras along with a military training film Sturges wrote about the same timeand a radio play adaptation of the movie done in 1943.The reputation of Preston Sturges has just grown and grown among film buffs. Yet, he has four or five absoluteclassics so Sturges never ranks high on polls of the best films of all time. No one can agree on which one tofocus their attention; plus, they're funny and you won't find a comedy on Sight & Sound's once a decade polluntil you reach The General at #34 and precious few after that. Fassbinder has a similar problem. He has somany strong films in so many varied styles it can be hard to get a grasp on all he accomplished. I have thesense he's fallen out of favor in recent years. Happily, Criterion and others have been keeping his body of workfront and center with their efforts. The Bitter Tears Of Petra Van Kant is as good a starting place as any. Inspiredby his own obsession with a handsome young actor, Fassbinder's tale uses the melodramatic style of DouglasSirk to inform his story of the twisted relationship between a brilliant fashion designer and her icy muse. Thegreat Hanna Schygulla is ideal as the object of desire and Fassbinder is both broadly entertaining andsubversive at the same time. This set contains various new interviews with his collaborators as well as asubstantial German documentary from 1992.DEAR WHITE PEOPLE ($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) THE RETRIEVAL ($34.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber)Why pair these movies together? They both tackle race in America with precision and intelligence. Otherwise,they are very different. Dear White People is a sly comedy that gained all sorts of deserved critical attention,strong press and some modest but encouraging box office for a truly independent film. (In the indie world, $4.4million at the box office should translate into strong numbers on DVD and BluRay sales and rentals, VOD and soon.) The Retrieval was a festival favorite but its critical acclaim didn't even begin to garner press or ticket sales.But both are worth your time and both signal directors who might well go on to substantial careers. Dear WhitePeople has fun mixing in reality TV, talk radio, gay geeks and more into a combustible mix lit by a frat party witha racist theme. Tyler James Williams of Everybody Hates Chris is all grown up here and quite winning but thestar of the show is Tessa Thompson as the voluble, smarter-than-you Sam White. Her tug of war between twomen is no contest since one of them is such a drip chemistry-wise and the violent showdown feels utterlycontrived and out of character. But some less effective acting in minor parts aside, writer director Justin Simienhas declared himself one to watch.Similarly, The Retrieval makes the most of a modest budget to tell its compelling story. In this case it's a dramaset during the Civil War era in which a boy named Will (Ashton Sanders) is assisting bounty hunters who trackdown runaway slaves. One can't help but think of Huckleberry Finn as the film progresses. Writer and directorChris Eska has delivered the sort of little-seen gem that was made for DVD. Not so long ago, a movie like thiswould be screened in a big city or two and then disappear and if it was lucky get rediscovered on late nite tv orat a revival house. Today? Everyone has the chance to see it right now. And should.FOYLE'S WAR SEASON 8 (streaming on Acorn.TV) -- I rarely discuss streaming or video on demand options;</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=0a09fbc0-7dff-4fdc-9cdd-44821d8b4156&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&3/6hey, it's hard enough to stay on top of the stuff coming out on BluRay! Nonetheless, I'll make an exception forFoyle's War, a show which launched with a brilliant first season and quickly became one of my favorite on TV foryears. It's hard to say goodbye to a beloved series for fans and it's often just as hard for the people making theshow itself. That's why so many great shows have drawn out their welcome, producing a final season or two (ormore) that is far inferior in quality to the original. Think MASH or All In The Family or Little House On The Prairieor ER or a million other examples. (That's why I give the most credit of all to a series like The Mary Tyler MooreShow or Breaking Bad or The Office (UK), which know when to leave well enough alone.) So here is Foyle'sWar finally saying goodbye. If you have any interest in a series that was initially set during WWII, a mystery witha strong grounding in history as a fascinating backdrop to some fascinating stories, dive into season one. You'llfind an excellent cast with Michael Kitchens giving a performance for the ages as Foyle, a man of integrity andfew words. As all involved tried to walk away and then came back again and again for just a few more episodes,the quality has unquestionably dropped. It's been precipitous enough that I've had to downgrade the seriesoverall from one of TV's best to one of those good shows marred by a drop-off in later seasons. Still, fans of theshow will undoubtedly want to say goodbye and the only way to do so is to watch the final three episodes onAcornTV. That's where newcomers will find earlier seasons as well, along with everything from Rumpole of theBailey to Doc Martin. It all began with Season 1, which of course is available on DVD for those Luddites whocan't handle streaming. (But even my mom can, so it's really pretty easy and you do get one month free.) Watchthat first season and you'll be hooked. And if someone can explain to me why creator Anthony Horowitz neverwrote a novel around these characters, I'd be mighty pleased. That's the real mystery, as far as I'm concerned.BOYS ($24.95 DVD; Wolfe Video) -- This is a gay coming of age tale, reportedly made for Danish TV and set inthe world of high school track teams. The fascinating aspect of seeing gay films from around the world is seeinghow starkly different different societies are towards gays and sex in general. Some countries, you feel like you'rewatching a gay film that would have been made in the US in the 1960s -- they try to be positive but are filled withself-loathing and stereotypes. Others make the culture you're in seem passe they're so progressive and coolabout it all. The Danes are awfully forward thinking in some ways, but this was made for TV so it's not terriblyexplicit or envelope-pushing, though the emphasis on one boy's home life proves especially interesting. Sieger(Gijs Blom) is questioning and confused, vulnerable after his mom's death and drawn to friendship with Marc.Marc (Ko Zandvliet) is most definitely not confused and wants a relationship. The usual misunderstandings andtwists and turns ensue. But the two actors have great chemistry. (Blom in particular is a find.) And the look of thefilm (by cinematographer Melle Van Essen) is top-notch. For those interested in the subject, it's a modest littlefind with one or two actors who might well break out into wider stardom.DOWNTON ABBEY SEASON 5 ($54.99 BluRay; PBS)  TYRANT SEASON ONE ($39.98 DVD; FOX)Have you switched to Empire yet? Primetime's hottest new soap of course is set in the world of hip-hop musicbut they're both essentially the same -- shows you watch for crazy plot twists and to see what happens next.Character development? Not so much. Downton Abbey began as a show that ripped off superior entertainmentlike its obvious precursor Upstairs Downstairs to the movie Mrs. Miniver and countless others. Now it's devolvedinto ripping off itself by just recycling storylines they've already done like Bates being accused of murder (again),Thomas being evil and then sympathetic and in the good graces of the family and then out of them and then inthem again so often it's become ludicrous. (Surely at some point, they'd learn their lesson?) The cast is soskillful, pleasures are there to be had even for those who prefer a modicum of logic and continuity.What's the difference between Downton Abbey and Empire or Tyrant? The latter two seem to know they're overthe top fun and let you revel in it, without the pretense of high art. Mind you, Tyrant is from people behindHomeland so they might have considered it a bid for Emmy greatness. Tyrant is set in a fictional Middle easterncountry run by a dictator, the father of the show's protagonist. Our hero who has made a decent life for himselfin America reluctantly returns for a wedding. When the ruler dies, he suddenly finds himself drawn into aiding his</p>

Fun? Yes, not to mentionwell-acted in a soapy sort of way and given a nice jolt by the various real-life events that intrude onto the action,like the Arab Spring.FURY ($34.99 BluRay; Sony) PORK CHOP HILL  KING: THE THE MARTIN LUTHER KING STORY A HOLE IN THE HEAD ($29.95 each BluRay; Olive Films)Fury came out, got some strong reviews, did well at the box office and will surely find more fans on DVD. Fairenough. But if you could invest in futures on movies the way you do in other markets, this would be one to put a"buy" on. Its reputation is sure to grow in years to come. It's a classic war film, built around the denizens of atank who face the horrors of war, the camaraderie of bonding under fire and all the other usual experiencesfaced by men in battle. Set during WW II, it's episodic and familiar in its way. But the cast led by Brad Pitt isexcellent from top to bottom, with Shia LaBeouf doing more to rehabilitate his image by simply delivering a goodperformance and Logan Lerman proving yet again he's got an innate likeabilty that is one of the sure signs of amovie star with a long career ahead of him. It's a big leap forward for David Ayer, the writer of Training Day andthe director of End Of Watch. Think Sam Fuller and you'll have a sense of the gritty reality this movie captures.It's a keeper.Every scene of the Korean war film Pork Chop Hill starring Gregory Peck is emblazoned on my brain. Why?Because apparently the local TV station in South Florida where I grew up owned a print of it. Back in those days,they'd fill up a late night/early morning slot with whatever was at hand. Why go dark (remember when TVstations signed off?) when you could show something for free and keep the lights on? So week after week afterweek, Pork Chop Hill would invariably air at 1 am or 2 am after regular programming was over. I've seen itdozens of times and have a fondness for it far beyond the film itself. As a fledgling night owl, I didn't want to goto sleep any more than that local station wanted to sign off and we'd both fight off the inevitable with Peck andhis men being ordered to take a hill. It was a meaningless gesture for a meaningless, militarily insignificantspeck of land. But in war you did as you were told and didn't ask why, even if you knew the goal at hand wasexceptionally pointless. The cynicism of the film is what makes it so lasting. Little did I know it was by directorLewis Milestone, who earlier delivered that classic anti-war film All Quiet On The Western Front. The castingwas an early triumph of the great Lynn Stalmaster, who got his start in TV and began to break into movies with IWant To Live and this one. You'll recognize almost every actor, but many became familiar faces after this moviecame out, not before. It's a minor gem and well worth any war movie buff's time. The BluRay looks quite goodand is the latest example of savvy vault diving by Olive, which goes into studio archives and puts out titles onBluRay that might otherwise escape notice. Also just out is King: The Martin Luther King Story starring PaulWinfield (a nice companion piece to Selma), and the Frank Sinatra vehicle A Hole In The Head, one of the lastgasps of the great director Frank Capra, and it shows. Still, you gotta love a movie with an advertising campaignthat insists it's "The Most Wonderful Entertainment In The Who Wide Wonderful World!" Only Sinatra and Caprafanatics will agree but at least it's out and looking pretty good.THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN ($39.99 DVD; PBS)Who can understand the vagaries of DVD and BluRay? This critically acclaimed, landmark miniseries aired in1984, won the Emmy for Best Miniseries and has been rather haplessly treated ever since. It garnered all sortsof accolades and brought new converts to the brilliant Raj Quartet series of novels by Paul Scott. It got excellentratings. And yet, after a desultory release on VHS it's been treated like a red-headed step child. It came out onDVD but looked poorly. It was rereleased in a 25th anniversary edition..and still looked terrible. It came out in amuch better looking version in the UK, but for some reason that's taken a decade -- a DECADE -- to come out in</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=0a09fbc0-7dff-4fdc-9cdd-44821d8b4156&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&5/6the US. So we're looking at a decade old remastering presented on DVD instead of BluRay. Nonetheless, it'sthe first time a decent edition of this show is worth watching in your home since it aired originally. The miniseriesis notably adult and reserved in its tone and plot lines. The central character is the rather hateful Merrick (TimPiggott-Smith), who becomes obsessed with the relationship between a young, London-educated Indian and aBritish girl right around the time India is beginning to decide maybe it doesn't want to be under the thumb ofBritish rule after all, thank you very much. The great Peggy Ashcroft has a plum smaller role, Charles Dancemade his mark and the cast throughout is exceptional. In trying to capture the scope of the books, the miniseriesdoes bite off more than it can chew. Scandalously, I would suggest it's ripe for remake, perhaps as four seasonswith ten episodes per. If you do it again, you better devote a lot more air time to a work that already runs to 14episodes. But it is satisfying overall, thanks to the general care and intelligence that marks this work that alongwith Brideshead Revisited and I, Claudius and others made it seem like the British owned the miniseries for awhile.THE FACTS OF LIFE -- COMPLETE SERIES ($199.99 DVD; Shout Factory)I remember a distressing number of episodes from The Facts Of Life, even though I swear it was never afavorite show of mine. Still, it was a key element in NBC's revival as the show was spun off from Diff'rent Strokesand helped launch The Golden Girls on Saturday night. A perennial Top 30 hit, it lasted for nine (!) seasons andgave Charlotte Rae the sort of showcase every journeyman actor dreams of. (Journeyman is a compliment; asin trouper.) It tackled countless hot button issues with a sitcom's half hour solution always at the ready, fromacceptance of people with disabilities to weight issues and drinking and about a million other things. At the heartof it was an ensemble of characters who got along great. They certainly got long in the tooth by the time Raestepped away after seven seasons (an old pro, she even knew when to get when the going was good) butNancy McKeon, Mindy Cohn and the rest always somehow kept our good will. This set contains most everythingand certainly everything Shout Factory could get the rights to include. You get the backdoor pilot episode thatintroduced the setting, two TV movies and a reunion panel discussion among other goodies. (The 2001 reunionmovie is missing; God knows why but I'm certain it wasn't for lack of trying on Shout's part.) Most of all you getall 201(!) silly disposable, dated episodes -- each of them comfort food for those who grew up with the seriesand perhaps serviceable entertainment for kids a little bit younger than the characters on the show. For fans,this is as good as it will ever get.NOTE: All prices are the suggested list price of the format offered for review. Typically, this is the mostexpensive format offered, such as a BluRay bundled set that includes a DVD and digital download. Most titleswill be on sale and many will be available in cheaper editions. Additionally, some titles will also be available viastreaming services and VOD. It would be exhausting and not terribly informative to offer all that info for everypurchase, especially since sale prices differ from website to website and week to week. Just keep in mind, mosteverything covered here will be more available more cheaply (and often a lot more cheaply) than the price welist.Thanks for reading.
