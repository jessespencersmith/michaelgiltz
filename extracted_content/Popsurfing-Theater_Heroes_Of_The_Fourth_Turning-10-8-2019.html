THEATER: Wrestling With Faith in "Heroes Of
The Fourth Turning"
HEROES  OF  THE  FOURTH  TURNING  ** 1/2 out of ****
PLAYWRIGHTS  HORIZONS
Wrestling with your faith is a noble and essential effort.  You'll find
many examples in the Torah, various Christian Bibles and  
commentary on the Koran, to name just some religious texts. Jacob
wrestles with the angel. Moses kvetches with Yahweh. And Abrahamargues with G-d about the possible destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah. True, that last one didn't turn out so well. But the very act
of questioning is the point.   Indeed, in the Jewish faith, for some,
arguing and challenging and thinking about ethics and morality andwhether this rule applies to that situation can seem the  purpose  of
religion.
Playwright Will Arbery hastens to assure us he moved far beyond this
movement and its politics. "I uncoiled myself from their world," hewrites in an author's note to his new play Heroes  Of  The  Fourth
Turning.  And yet, that world informs who Arbery is, as surely as
William F. Buckley Jr. and William Safire and Michael Novak
informed me, a Catholic conservative turned independent turnedprogressive.
Like Jacob, Arbery wrestles with the angels of his childhood: the
parents who embraced a far-right strain of Catholicism (and hosted a
political event for Pat Buchanan), the isolated Wyoming school wherethey flourished as academics and inspired so many students, and thedeeply conservative friends he grew up with and studied with and
debated and argued with far into the night. He wants to understand
and empathize and humanize the people he loves, but agonizes overwhether this might legitimize some of their poisonous beliefs andactions.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On</p>
<p>The result? His play is set in August of 2017 as four friends come
together to celebrate Gina, one of their moms and a mentor to them all
becoming the head of the Catholic college that has defined their life.  
Two of them remain true believers. And while two of them are either
questioning some of those stances or so fucked up they can't help butquestion everything, they're far too timid in their tentative steps
towards the light (or away from it, depending on your point of view),
that they can't really challenge the relentless convictions of the othertwo.
It's like hanging out with in-laws or old friends. You might hint at a
difference of opinion, but just don't have the energy or heart to get
into it. Or you think, "What's the point?" And so the apostates, theones who have realized not all liberals are the devil in disguise, aresimply too afraid to righteously speak their minds. The true believersare happy to question themselves, but only when it comes to tactics.
These people are afraid to confront their own doubts and failings
because doubt is for nonbelievers. And if someone else tries to open up(which they all do, however tentatively), it's met by an embarrassedsilence or an angry closing of the topic. This is a thoughtful, well-acted, sometimes frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying drama worthwrestling with. But one element of the production is spot-on:  Heroes
Of  The  Fourth  Turning  takes place in near-total darkness.
The action takes place mostly in real time at the tail end of a party.First we met the quiet, stoic Justin, a burly man of few words who isalways carrying a weapon. At the beginning of the show, he shoots a
deer from his back porch but then has trouble gutting it. Then during
the party, he casually sports a pistol jammed casually into the back ofhis pants. If the culture wars break into real violence, Justin will beready.
He's paired in our minds with Emily. She is dealing with a debilitating
illness and the fact that everyone around her insists on seeing Emily asShaky Ground

<p>a paragon of suffering virtue and the illness as a wonderfully
ennobling cross to bear. And with a word here and a gesture there, we
sense Emily and Justin have an unspoken, un-acted upon bond.Towards the beginning of the show, Justin says he has something totell Emily and we know precisely what she is hoping for.
Emily is the daughter of Gina, the woman named the new president of
the tiny Catholic Transfiguration College of Wyoming. (Picture AveMaria University,  the school founded in Florida by Tom Monaghan of
Domino's Pizza. He fondly hoped the nearby town would be free ofpre-marital sex, contraception and pornography. In short, PopeBenedict, yes. Pope Francis, not so much.) But she's ever so cautiouslythe most rebellious of her friends. That amounts to being friends withsomeone who works for Planned Parenthood while still quickly
agreeing abortion is murder full stop, but it's something.
Maybe Emily is simply shaking off the restrictions of being the
daughter of two rock star parents, the people everyone around heradmired and loved and indeed worshipped. Their friend Kevin,
however, is just messed up. Maybe his cloistered childhood where any
intimation of sex or desire was painted as ugly and sinful is to blame.Maybe Kevin would have had issues even if he was raised by twolesbian moms of color. But Kevin is a hapless figure, drinking too hardand incapable of going five minutes without mentioning masturbation
or his penis or pent-up sexual desires. He's not a train wreck because a
train wreck might actually leave some damage in its path. Kevin willonly hurt himself.
He shows up unexpectedly for the party, and is thrilled to discover
Teresa has popped in as well. She's a fire-breather of a conservative
thinker a la Ann Coulter, seemingly making a name for herself
delivering diatribes for a Breitbart-style website. Arbery is at his bestbringing Teresa to life. He may not agree with her views, but he knowsthe power and poetry of a steam-rolling monologue and Teresa gets
the best of them.
These friends banter and bicker back and forth and it's all rather
familiar. Of course, instead of debating the dotcom bubble or OccupyWall Street's importance, these four debate the culture wars, the
incipient violence sure to engulf America (a truism of true believers on
the far right and the far left) and various theological ideas. But mostlyit amounts to dredging up old issues and new desire. Teresa had pre-marital sex but was allowed to remain in school, for example. AndKevin desperately wishes the engaged Teresa had shared that bit of
sinning with him.
Like any party, Heroes  of  the  Fourth  Turning  has an up and down
rhythm. Something of interest takes place and then it all settles back
down again before something else worth noting happens. It's never
boring, but stretches of the show simply happen, a problem when your
characters are afraid or uninterested in confronting one another. Oh,</p>
<p>they argue and fight and make up and argue again and Kevin throws
up (of course) but the unspoken mostly remains just that.
Director Danya Taymor keeps things on an even keel, though I'm not
as sure about the technical side. The costumes by Sarafina Bush aresolid. But the setting is too  solid. A large imposing rock or the
intimations of a hill or mountain in the distance turns what mighthave been the wide open spaces of Wyoming into a constrictedsuffocating location. Maybe their world is as cramped as their ideasseem, sure, but that vaguely imposing structure is too hard to makeout in the too-dark lighting of Isabella Byrd. Instead of a specific
setting or a symbolic one, it remains...insubstantial.
Then Gina shows up and the play comes to life. Gina is Emily's mom
and the mentor they all admire. She's also the first person ready totangle. Why would the new President of Transfiguration College ofWyoming hesitate to put these kids in their place? So Teresa has aworthy opponent and they go at it with vigor. Gina also takes Emily,
Kevin and Justin down a peg or two, but it's Teresa who cuts the most
formidable target and Gina doesn't hesitate. Michele Pawk commandsthe stage every moment she's on it.
The problem is that these two alpha women are not really challenging
each other. Teresa is a firebrand who is convinced the culture warswill soon turn violent. She sees Christians in the US as an oppressedminority, even though most American Christians (even most Catholics)don't agree with her far right stances on abortion, gay rights and the
like. She mocks identity politics, sees Hillary Clinton as essentially the
anti-Christ and pitys the fool who would try and out-debate her on anyof this. I'm sure Gina would agree with every word.
Sure, Gina mocks Teresa for admiring the yahoos in the new Trump
administration. Teresa responds by questioning Gina's embrace of PatBuchanan, a stone-cold racist who paved the way for Trump and hisilk. But they're not really hitting at the core of their beliefs. It's allabout tactics. Later, when Emily apologizes for her mom'sbrusqueness, Teresa brushes off their argument as fun. And she means
it. We've been waiting all night for someone to either embrace their
beliefs in a convincing manner or question them with power andauthority. Ultimately, all Arbery can bring his characters to do is hintat the more radical break they might make some day.
The cast is strong, but the writing lets them down at the crucial
moment when their masks are dropped. Justin begins the show bykilling that deer and then hesitating to gut it. But if there's aconnection to that and his character during the rest of the show, Imissed it. Indeed, Justin wants the school to add marksmanship to the
curriculum. He's a true believer and  a Christian soldier. (Gina says no
to adding weapons training, but purely because of the optics. Again:
tactics!)</p>
<p>Kevin blurts out his feelings repeatedly yet they're so entangled with
self-loathing it's hard to listen. He could use a lot of therapy, if far
right conservatives believed in therapy.
Teresa briefly, shakily confesses she thinks her wedding will be a
disaster because she doesn't really have friends, because she keepseveryone at a distance...because she really doesn't know how to love at
all.
Emily shakes off the sickly martyr label everyone slaps on her and even
insists her Planned Parenthood friend maybe isn't a Nazi. But whatshe really longs for is someone to care for her like a woman and we
just know the monk-like Justin won't be the one. Their moment of
openness with each other might have been a strong ending for theshow.
Instead, Arbery gives Emily a fit, to the point where she's practically
speaking in tongues. For a moment it even seems she might be literally
sitting on Justin's face after collapsing, forcing the issue of sexual
intimacy. That outrageousness would be preferable to her out-of-character aria about sleeping around, which is both unconvincing andbeside the point. Kevin maybe just needs sex; Emily needs love. Whena character spends the entire show primly saying "gosh" to this or thatbit of profanity, it's too easy to have them curse as a way of insisting
they're revealing their authentic selves.
Let's be clear. Jeb Kreager is quietly convincing as Justin and doesn't
overplay the gung-ho military aspect at all. Julia McDermott is strong
as the pain-wracked Emily, who is more pained perhaps by slowly
understanding her faith is misplaced. John Zdrojeski takes an over-the-top loser like Kevin and keeps him rooted in reality, so consistentlya loser you accept him rather than tire of him. Zoë Winters dives into
the big speeches of Teresa with fervor. And yet none of their big
emotional scenes truly work. It's not their fault. Arbery perhapsprefers his characters with their masks on because taking those off --even for a moment -- feels like a betrayal. They don't want to removetheir masks, so how can he do it for them? I'll be very interested to see
his next play, a show that doesn't come freighted with so much of his
specific childhood.
And a final metaphysical flourish fell utterly flat for me. Is it hinting at
the End Times? The coming War? Are the walls of Jericho falling? No
thanks, not in a show that strives to be rooted in flawed but sincere
people. Arbery wrestles here with the angels of his childhood. Butunlike Jacob and Moses and Abraham, I don't think he was playing towin.
