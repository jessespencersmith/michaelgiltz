            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 7 ,  2 0 0 7The NYTimes Looks Lost On "Lost"I'm probably just jealous, but the NYTimes coverage of TV is justdownright odd. They can't really take TV seriously because it's beneaththem. But so many of the reviews and articles they write treat TV withabsurdly high-falutin' analysis. Recently, they decided reality showslike "American Idol" were an example of generational warfare. (Thetruth is that "Idol" is wildly popular in part because it is one of the fewshows entire extended families from grandparents to grandchildrencan watch and enjoy together.) Now they're dissecting "Lost" and theNYTimes seems as lost as ever.“Lost” is at heart a science-fiction thriller, while “Heroes” ismore of a comic book, but both genres have a similar appeal:they provide an alternative society for those who don’t fitcomfortably into their own. (That is to say, smart, sociallyawkward adults and all 12-year-old boys.)No matter how far-fetched and complicated that imaginaryworld may be, it is bound by its own intricate set of rules andcustoms, be it Quidditch regulations at Hogwarts; etiquette onSuperman’s native planet, Krypton; or military rank in“Battlestar Galactica.”"Lost" and "Heroes" appeal to smart, socially awkward adults?Meaning socially well-adjusted adults can't be bothered with them? Ithink they're confusing the feelings of some of the characters with theaudience. Surely, "Heroes" appeals to anyone who enjoys fun,well-written TV shows. Does "24" appeal only to hawkish people with ataste for torture?And whatever could they mean by the intricate set of rules and customswhen they refer to the etiquette on Superman's native planet, Krypton?I haven't devoured ALL of Superman's many forms, but I've seen manyof the movies and TV shows and read years of the strip and haven't aclue as to what she might be talking about. And the military protocol on"Battlestar Galactica" is so loose an entire storyline was built aroundtheir shock when they came into contact with another ship that WASrun by the rules. Some more strange comments:The fans of these kinds of serialized thrillers are unusuallypassionate and devoted, carrying a clout not unlike that ofanti-abortion activists — their intensity is in some ways moreNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
