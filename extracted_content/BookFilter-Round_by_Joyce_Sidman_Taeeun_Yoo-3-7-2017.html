From the Publisher:
If you look closely, you will find that the world is bursting, swelling,
budding, and ripening with round things awaiting discovery—like eggs
about to hatch, sunflowers stretching toward the sun, or planets slowlyspinning together for billions of years.Whimsical and imaginative, this poetic ode to all that is round and full of
wonder by the Newbery  Honor–winning author and poet Joyce Sidman,
with illustrations by
the two-time  New York Best Illustrated Book award recipient Taeeun Yoo,
inspires curiosity and wonder for this (round) little earth we call home.

What We Say
This gentle ode to all things round begins and ends with the same words: "I love round things." The straightforward,
declarative sentences of Joyce Sidman don't invite repeated reading and sound more like an adult than the inquisitive,wonder-full girl depicted. It's the warm and inviting images of Taeeun Yoo that save the day. They offer mushrooms that
are almost Wonka-like in their bursting glory, eye-catching fields of sunflowers, a gorgeous full moon and enough less-
obvious round items to keep kids pointing, without turning the illustrations into a banal guessing game. Not the best, butpleasant enough for nature fans. -- Michael GiltzShare This Book
