9/23/2004 01:14:00 AMAs the US spends $200 billion (and counting) on the quagmire that isIraq while shouldering a record federal debt and record annual deficitof $420 billion (and counting), no one seems to suggest that war isn'tthe best time to enact huge tax cuts without any way to pay forthem.The Democrats and fiscally mdoerate Republicans like John McCainwere holding the line, but Democratic leaders caved to election yearfears of looking weak on tax cuts and agreed to terms far worse thanwhat the Republicans were offering just a few months ago. Nicegoing, guys. As the New York Times noted,"The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated thatdebt will climb by $2.3 trillion over the next 10 years, and thatmaking all Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent would cost an additional$1.9 trillion by the end of 2014."That's an ADDITIONAL $1.9 trillion, for a total from these cuts aloneof $4.2 trillion. I'd love to see say $200 billion spent on a ManhattanProject to develop alternative energy sources within the next tenyears and end our dependency on not just foreign oil but ALL oil. (Ifwe can put a man on the moon....) Think of the dramatic savingslong-term in not having to prop up huge dictatorships or letting oureconomy be held hostage by overseas countries. But this money isjust being frittered away without any reason, without anyacknowledgement that we're at war and deep in debt and maybe thisisn't the time to show largesse to a segment of the population. It'stime to dig deep and pay a price to secure our future.
