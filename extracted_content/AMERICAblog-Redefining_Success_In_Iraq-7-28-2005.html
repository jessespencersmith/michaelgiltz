7/28/2005 01:35:00 PMI posted yesterday about the Army's recruitment shortfall andhow a top US general said we could begin a pullout in spring of2006. And what conditions did that general call for before webegin pulling up stakes and heading home? How did thatgeneral (re)define success in Iraq?Speaking earlier with U.S. reporters traveling withRumsfeld, Gen. George Casey, the top Americancommander in Iraq, said he believed a U.S. troopwithdrawal could begin by spring 2006 if progress continueson the political front and if the insurgency does notexpand.So the insurgency is stronger than ever, killing more people this yearthan it did last year, killing foreign diplomats with impunity, andgenerally things have gone to hell in a handbasket in the two yearssince Bush trumpeted "Mission Accomplished." And now we're saying,well, as long as IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE, our job is done? Talkabout moving the goalposts.
