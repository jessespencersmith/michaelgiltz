            <p>S U N D AY,  M A R C H  3 0 ,  2 0 0 8The IRA's 2008: An Historic SweepThe 2008 IRA Awards have just been announced and it's an historic,perhaps record-setting sweep for one of the year's most acclaimed butoverlooked movies.The IRAs is an annual get-together of movie buffs that was launched bycollege friends 32 years ago as a counter to the more mundane Oscars.These are film fanatics who go to Film Forum and Anthology Archivesand film festivals throughout America and around the world. Membershave won major Oscars and worked on Oscar-winning Best Picturewinners, they've written acclaimed and best-selling Hollywoodbiographies like Ed Sikov's Dark Victory: The Life Of Bette Davis, thedefinitive Oscar book (indeed the definitive awards book) Inside Oscar,worked at major magazines and newspapers covering the industry,worked at major studios and in the independent film industry or in mycase just schlepped around as a freelancer and watched a lot of moviesyear in and year out. In other words, IRA members range from majorplayers to avid fans.So here are this year's winners followed by the balloting as it happenedwith all the top vote-getters listed and the Bronx cheers at the end ofSominex and Dramamine movies (those that put us to sleep or made ussick) and Mechanical Actor and Actress.BEST PICTURE: The Assassination of Jesse James By The CowardRobert FordBEST DIRECTOR: Andrew Dominik - The Assassination of JesseJames By The Coward Robert FordBEST ACTOR: Casey Affleck - The Assassination of Jesse James ByThe Coward Robert FordBEST ACTRESS: Marina Hands - Lady ChatterleyBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Paul Schneider - The Assassinationof Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford, Lars and the Real Girl.BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Amy Ryan - Gone Baby GoneBEST SCREENPLAY: Corneliu Porumboiu - 12:08 East OfBucharestBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY: Roger Deakins - The Assassination OfJesse James By The Coward Robert Ford, No Country For Old Men, InNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
