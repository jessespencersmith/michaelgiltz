            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 9 ,  2 0 0 7Should "Ratatouille" Go For The Best PictureOscar?There's a lengthy article in the New York Times about Ratatouille. It'sarguably the best-reviewed movie of the year and in a year of lengthy,darker movies, it's a pure delight. (And while being a huge blockbustercan be a problem for a nominee -- despite Titanic -- in this case, I don'tthink Hollywood would care at all that it made $200 mil here and amassive $400 mil overseas.) It has a shot at being the first animatedmovie since Beauty and the Beast to get nominated for Best Picture.The big debate? Should Ratatouille go for Best Picture and risksquandering its chance at Best Animated Film, especially in a year withvery worthy competitors like Persepolis, The Simpsons Movie andShrek The Third? Duh. The Best Animated Film Oscar is a ghettoizedcategory that is literally meaningless at the box office and in prestige.Except for winning your office Oscar pool, it's a joke. Frankly, thecategory was created because animated films like Toy Story and TheIncredibles were so clearly superior to their live action competitors thatHollywood was finding it increasingly difficult to explain away whycartoons didn't count when it came to Best Picture. If Ratatouille has ashot -- and it does -- Disney should go all in. Make absolutely clear theyare pushing for a Best Picture nomination and don't even talk about theconsolation prize of Best Animated Film. Disney has never won a BestPicture Oscar and this film has the accolades and the struggling artisttale that would make it catnip for voters. Why settle for a dullsecondary category when you've got a shot at history? Even snagging anomination would be historic and once that happens anything ispossible.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
