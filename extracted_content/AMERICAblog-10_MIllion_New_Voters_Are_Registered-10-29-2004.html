10/29/2004 04:27:00 PMWell, if nothing else, this election (and the fiasco of 2000) haveenergized Americans into taking their right to vote seriously. USAToday reports that 10 million new voters are on the rolls, almostpromising a bit of chaos thanks to the new voters, new machines,new rules and batteries of lawyers and poll watchers spreading out allover the country.You better get to the polls early -- they're anticipating the highestvoter turnout in three decades.
