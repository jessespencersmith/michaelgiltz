8/09/2005 05:36:00 PMBush continues to show his utter disregard and contempt forthe brave men and women who are dying in a war he launchedbased on lies to the American people. (Thanks to threaderSean for reminding us of the memorial.) Bush is the firstPresident in modern history and probably the first Presidentever to refuse to attend a single military funeral. And he'sdoing so during wartime and after his reelection, when anycynical calculation that pictures of Bush at a funeral might notpoll well are absolutely moot. What possible reason does Bushhave for ignoring this pain and suffering? Even the New YorkPost called on Bush to attend this memorial service. And Bushcouldn't be bothered.Thousands mourned in Cleveland. Where was Bush? Onvacation -- the longest Presidential vacation in 36 years.George Bush: MIA. As Always.
