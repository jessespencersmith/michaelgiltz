 28Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyIdol : Judges Refuse To Save Lacey
Brown; Top 11 Back Tuesday

Lacey Brown was the first contestant to be dumped
from the Top 12 on American Idol.  Though her
reviews for performing "Ruby Tuesday" on RollingStones night were okay, Lacey found herself in thebottom three, along with Paige Miles (who was still
fighting laryngitis) and the pin up-able but lambasted
Tim Urban. A stunned Urban was the first to be toldhe was safe. It came down to Paige and Lacey andLacey was the one with the lowest vote total. If Urban
can stay out of the bottom two with his universally
derided reggae spin on "Under My Thumb," his looks should keep him safe for a few weeks.
Paige and Lacey were left to face off. The judges can use one "save" per season, giving the person with the
lowest votes one more chance. (The following week, two people will be sent packing and the save is onlygood until the show reaches the Top 5.) Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson confirmed one of them was
worth saving but apparently it was the under the weather Paige and not Lacey.
The show began with former Idol winner David Cook performing a solid version of "Jumping Jack
Flash," talking up an album in the works and his upcoming trip to Africa for Idol Gives Back. Later
performances included Orianthi doing her new single "According To You" (then delivering a thoroughly
unremarkable anecdote about auditioning for Michael Jackson) and Ke$ha's Gaga-like "Blah Blah Blah."
Do you agree it was Lacey's time to go or should the judges have used their save?

i was taken back that lacy and page were in the bottom 2. page has a good voice and energy, so i
was worry that she might be voted off. lacy is one dimensiona l. if she was not voted off last night
she would've been gone next week. so, it is not a big deal that tim urban escaped the grim reaperthis week, because he will be gone within 2 weeks. im tired of his saucer eyes. Didi is one contestant that im shocked that the judges like her. her voice is so weak. none of hersongs i find enjoyable. i like casey james, but i do not think he will win. his head must be swimming from the judgescomments. they told him he should not be standing still playing his guitar; however, that is whatcrystal does. im annoyed with the labels they put on him--blues guitar and hendrix. he does not playa blues guitar and he does not play like hendrix. i thought he had the best song choice (the songnot heard on the radio but a strong song) and i liked the sound.
i was shocked that siobhan did "paint it balck". i did not think anybody would do that song. she did a
very good job. which leads to my top 3 siobhan, lynche, and crystal.
Thanks for reading and offering your analysis. If the top three is all women, you willcertainly be in line with the judges who say it's the year for them.

okay for lacey to go - though liked her closing save-me performanc e
urban has been putting on that what me? shock face for too long. lots of bloggers on other sites
seem to swoon for him. he has weakest voice
i hope paige has a break out moment. she does have a power voicemichael lynche annoys me - something insincere about him i can't put my finger on.aaron was great with angie but my gut favorite is lee dewyze.michael - did you already clarify if it is the top 10 that goes on tour rather than the top 12?
I'm not Michael, but historical ly it is only the top 10 that goes on tour, next weeks show sill
be about who gets to go on the tour. They do the same build up so they can start selling
the tickets. And I agree with your take on Lynche. Something phony there. But I admittedly ,
liked the Urban version of Under my Thumb. I never liked the song before, but I enjoyedthe fact that he tried something new. And I think that shocked look is genuine. After theripping to shreds he got by the judges, I think he expected to go home. I think the overpagenty Amber Tamblyn look a like is the one with the worst voice. She has hit her peakas a singer and has nowhere to go but down.
Yikes! Wrong again about the tour. I absolutely believe Urban's stunned reaction tonot being cut. If it's fake, he's a much better actor than singer. And since thejudges have given him loads of criticism (except for Hallelujah ), he had every
reason to believe he could be cut. Thanks guys for the tour correction .
I don't really watch the show, but I heard Lacey's "Ruby Tuesday" on a morning news show, and Ithink she proves that what the endless auditionin g process Idol uses is looking for is decidedly NOT
talent. Yes, she deserved to be sent home.
Paige is overrated, whether she has laryngitis or not, so it's not surprising she's in the Bottom 3. Her
rendition of Chaplin's "Smile" (when she was healthy) was cringe-wor thy, and it's hard to tell if that
odd vibrato in her voice is the result of nerves or bad technique.
Urban's rendition of Under My Thumb" wasn't nearly as bad as everyone made out. Jason Castro
went far doing that exact kind of thing, and Sting has made a career of it. yet it's spooky he mayparlay the teen idol thing past where he should go.

59 FansLacey should have gone, should have gone before Lilly as far as that goes. Wonder why she was
overpraise d for doing "The Story" initially when what makes that song amazing was Brandi
Carlisle's ability to be fragile at first, then break into full-throa ted rocker in the same high key,
something Lacey avoided altogether .
It was like listening to someone cover "Stairway To Heaven" while doing the soft ballad at thebeginning, and then totally omitting the rocking second part. But at least now they're letting themchoose their one-for-th e-road song, rather than forcing them to sing the song that got them booted
off, which seemed like cruel and unusual punishment .
It's hard sometimes for the band to have multiple versions ready to perform for every
contestant . But since the band had already worked up an arrangemen t for The Story, I
agree that they let the contestant choose, rather than forcing them to sing the song that put
them in danger. Plus, I'm glad they perform while the judges talk rather than after gettingbooted (a change I suggested in seasons past) because it let's them sing to stay, ratherthan warble during the pain of knowing they're gone.
BTW, Michael is spot on regarding Ke$ha. It's hard to believe the producers of AI are so
hard up for filler material that they turn over their platform to that wannabe. Her performance was so ridiculous , it was a wonder that half the contestant s didn't depart in the middle of
it, having suddenly decided they no longer wanted to be in show business.
Forget waterboard ing. Just play Ke$ha and Heidi Montag songs back to back and the CIA
will get all the confession s they can handle. Knew she was a no-talent when she was
trashing Britney Spears earlier this month, instantly making Britney sympatheti c for the first
time in ages. But, did she really have to remove all doubt in front of millions and millions?
This is the first time I have heard Keisha sing I thought at first it was the judges
idea to have her and then after she finished they would judger her and send herhome and keep all the kids and say that is not what we ever want to see any ofyou do!
What was interestin g about last night's show was how Crystal Bowersox was given the opportunit y
to explain herself. 
Obviously the Judges are doing everything in their power to try to position her as the winner. But again..... .. She acts like a frumpy old woman who keeps an 8x10 glossy of Tyrone Power on her
bedroom wall. Paige Miles is a great singer despite the fact that the Judges have decided she will not go far. Concerning Michael Lynche:... .... Am I the only one who thinks it's inappropia te for a large-size d
man to dance and act like he's a skinny, teenage kid?FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

164 FansTyrone Power? Funny, but I don't get a granny vibe from a chick with dreadlocks singing
the Stones. And you're wrong about the judges and Paige: they said that they would usethe save on one of the bottom two. Since they didn't use it for Lacey, clearly they wouldhave used it to save Paige this week. It may just have been her illness and they won'tnecessaril y use it for her down the road, but at least they agreed with you that last night
was too soon for her to go home.
Let's be honest, five years from now when someone brings up the name of CrystalBowersox it will be followed by the qustion; "She owns how many cats?"

Actually I'm glad that Crystal got to say something because EVERY season Simon et alpick a frontrunne r and ram them down our throats and at times that can backfire (remember
the Daughtry fiasco?). What Simon said the other night about Crystal's performanc e, then
went on to say that she can't feel she has this in her pocket was just wrong, so I'm gladthat Ryan let her say something about that. 
Wow, did I just say something nice about Ryan? Will wonders never cease.Anyway, I actually like Crystal but I think that Siobhan is the better singer/per former for the
girls and I hope she does well. She won't need to win to have a career, but it would be nice
to see her go far in this competitio n.
I actually like Mike's voice, though not a fan of the dance moves. He has talent and willlikely go much further than most of the guys, along with Lee. Aaron will get the tween/teenvote, as will Tim Urban, though he isn't as good as Alex Lambert who didn't even make thetop 12.
I thought David Cook gave a very good performanc e, but I wasn't crazy about Orianthi's
vocals, though her guitar playing was stellar and she can really shred. I could have done
without Keisha altogether and I hope that future results shows don't repeat this week's. 
Looking forward to next week. Any idea what the genre/form at will be?
No idea about the genre. I wish they'd tell us every week and let us peek at the
playlist of song choices.
Ewww.. sorry for the misspellin gs, etc. It's late. I'm tired and you can't edit the darn thing, I guess.

Definitely time for poor Lacey to go. She shouldn't have been in the Top 12 to begin with, jmho.

5 Fans"quirkines s" in the world couldn't cover that up. 
Nice to see David Cook. Finally someone to do justice to a Stones theme week. Orianthe is a very
good guitarist, but I'm not sure her trying to piggyback a vocal on that is working. Ke$ha a GaGawannabe? Maybe so, but not even close. The was crude, grating, amateurish and I don't think evenSHE believes it. 
But, OHHHZZZZZ. .. the dramazzz this week of Simon and Ryan. Could it possibly get more
contrived? Maybe I'm just getting to old to watch this show any longer. I'd love to be a fly on the
wall in a producer's meeting. Just sayin'
I agree with your comments about the pro performers . David Cook was good but the other
two were dull. Ryan and Simon's face-off is just a joke of course and not a very good one.
The average age of the viewers of Idol is creeping up into the 30s....
Well my last comment didn't make it through moderation . Let me try this.....I am on the west coast.
AI has not yet aired. If you must spoil, could you please be a little considerat e and keep it out of
the headline? Or wait an hour, please.
I sympathize , but I've learned to avoid cruising the internet when I haven't yet viewed the
results. That way Michael gets to finish his work before bedtime and we won't get a spoiler,so everyone's happy.
AmandaRuth , I'm sorry to have spoiled the show for you by posting the results. Unfortunat
ely, I'm not the only one. If you go onto any news website, they will have the results in a
headline or a ticker of breaking news. On Huffington , they often also post the AP story on
the results with photos of who was sent packing. Generic headlines (like "Idol ResultsAnnounced" ) just don't cut it with editors and readers, I'm afraid. If I delayed posting the
results, people who wanted to know would just go to other websites, defeating the purposeof providing coverage on HuffPo in the first place. Plus, if I delayed an hour, someonewould ask for it to be delayed two hours till they got home from work. (I used to have thisproblem with "24," when the show was so hot the plot twists would be discussed the nextmorning. Now I can wait and watch two weeks at once without fear of stumbling on aspoiler.) As with the Olympics and the Oscars and sports all live events, I'm afraid you just
have to avoid going online to news sites. The same thing happens to me: some weeks,
when I'm late watching the results on DVR, I forget and go online to check my email andspot the FOX press release in my inbox with the name of who got cut in the header.Arghh!
MichaelI certainly appreciate your being on top of it - and trying to make it into somethingvaguely interestin g. 
But don't you agree that this really is the most lamentable season in AI history??!Somewhere along the line they decided that a singing competitio n was NOT aPermalink  | Share it

If you held off, yes, they might go to other sites to read who won, but they would
always come back to you because you actually talk about it in an honest andcompelling way. You don't get snide about anything, except maybe Crystals teeth-but I can forgive that, and you sometimes reply to those who are following you. Idon't read the other posts here about the show because they are always bittersounding. Keep up the good work, and I'll keep coming back.
