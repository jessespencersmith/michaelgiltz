This is really weird for Cannes Film festival. I have never seen so many badly dressed, overdressed,winter dressed females. It is hot in May in the south of france, what happended to beautiful spring clothes. I guess the President of the jury brought with her the sense of ugliness and doom that she used for herchoice of winners. All dreadful dreary films that will attract pseudo intelectuals.Hopefully we will be spared the Antichrist and the white Ribbon both by totally self absorbed director s.Pistoo.

Carine Roitfeld's dress is okay, but her hair and makeup make her look like that girl who
comes climbing out of the well in "The Ring".
LemonGrass2  I'm a Fan of LemonGrass2  permalink
Aishwarya Rai's looked like something from the "Special Occasion Dresses" dept. in Loehmann's orsomething. 
Hilary Swank's was an interesting archtiectural using what seems to be a relatively new twist in red
carpet bodices: napkin folding. Flattering and stunning nonetheless. 
Robin Wright Penn's were lovely. (boy what she's been going through!). Sharon Stone mustn't be well, so no critiques from me about her. Dita Von Teese came out a winner. (what's she done that's so important as to merit a fabulous dress
lent by a terrific designer? Or was it vintage? Still, someone must have donated or lent it!)
OH and to someone who said M. Obama's inaugural gown inspired all this: She wasn't the first to wear
asymmetrical. It was trendy all season prior to her big debut--in that infantile monstrosity, btw. She justput it on the global map...

Who is number six? The ladies all look fabulous but as others have noted they do look a littlelike a cheeseburger, fries and a big shake would do them some good.
LMPE  I'm a Fan of LMPE  permalink
The last time that I saw such asymmetry was in "A Clockwork Orange" (Alex's eyelash).

Wright Penn and Abbie Cornish look especially lovely. Angelina looks frumpish with a bony
chest.

OMG, did Sharon Stone just come from the set of The Leona Helmsley Story.
What did she do to herself?
BlueBoomer  I'm a Fan of BlueBoomer  permalink
i have always liked the asymmetrical neckline, but this seems to be a continuation of the "Michelle
Obama inauguration dress" phenomenon (a dress I didn't like on her, BTW)... BUT, Michelle Yeoh andDita von Teese had the best looks, by far...Angelina looked washed out, and that editor of FrenchVogue -- YIKES, what a mess!!!
scubalady  I'm a Fan of scubalady  permalink
Maybe Michelle Yeoh's look is good but it's almost painful to watch her collarbonesstruggling very hard to actually stay under her skin. And I guess if we could see herfrom the back, the same could be said about the shoulder blades.
