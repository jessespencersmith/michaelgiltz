 DVDs: What Should Obama
Watch?
Read More:  Animation , Barack Obama , Criterion , Dvds,
Movies, Tv, Entertainment News
So people have been suggesting books for Obama
to read.  But what DVDs should 44 watch? We
know he's very well read and that The Godfatheris one of his favorite movies. (If I'd been invitedto the inauguration, I would have brought theBluRay edition of that as a thank-you gift. Youlose, Barack!) But what films/documentaries/TVshows would you recommend for him? They canbe something fun to take his mind off thepressures of work ( Arthur  and Monty Python
and the Holy Grail  are two of my favorite
comedies), documentaries about serious subjects
(I'm sure he's already seen An Inconvenient Truth ), TV shows about people he should keep in
mind ( The Wire  is a great example) or movies that illuminate serious ideas. Just this week is a new
release of a classic film Obama should watch or watch again. He doesn't need a primer onimmigrants but maybe if he screened Gregroy Nava's acclaimed, groundbreaking El Norte ($39.95on regular or BluRay; Criterion) it would prompt OTHER Americans to check out this film. It's oneof the first and certainly most notable efforts to put a human face on illegal immigration via thestory of a brother and sister who journey from Guatemala to the US hoping for a better life. Ihaven't seen the BluRay version, but Criterion's typically thoughtful extras will give Obamasomething new to enjoy if he's already seen the film: you get commentary from Nava, adocumentary about the making of the film, Nava's student film and even a reprint of Roger Ebert'sinsightful review at the time.
So what DVDs would you put on Obama's Netflix list?
ALSO OUT THIS WEEK:
CRITERION:  El Norte  isn't Criterion's only release. They've also put out Douglas Sirk's
Magnificent Obsession  ($39.95; Criterion), a movie bedeviled with problems in earlier DVD
releases. This Rock Hudson-Jane Wyman weepie is absurd, even by the standards of a

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Should Obama Watch?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-should-obama-wa_b_159411.html [4/5/2009 12:35:35 PM]melodramatic master like Sirk. I prefer some of his other films, but boy does this look great and
you get the equally over-the-top 1935 version starring Robert Taylor and Irene Dunne in the storyof a playboy who becomes a world-class doctor so he can perform experimental surgery on thewoman he loves and restore her sight. I've always associated Roberto Rossellini with neorealism soit's a shock for me to discover The Taking Of Power By Louis XIV  ($29.95; Criterion) and
Rossellini's History Films: Renaissance and Enlightenment  ($59.95; Eclipse). The history films
were made for TV in the 70s and are talkie expositions of Pascal, Cartesius and the like. Taking ofPower is a look at the Sun King I'd never even heard of -- and by definition for me, any film not
listed in Leonard Maltin's movie guide is "rare" and "little known." And only Criterion's "budget"line Eclipse would take the time to release three high-minded films that are 2 and almost 3 andover 4 hours long.
DOCUMENTARIES  -- A film crew has been following Obama around since before he announced
he was running for President ( Ed Norton is involved ) and boy, that promises to be a humdinger.
Until then, we have the curio Patti Smith: Dream Of Life  ($24.98; Palm). It's interesting, but
frustrating. Filmmaker Steven Sebring knew nothing about Smith when he began the project 11
years ago and his indifference to her stature perhaps helped Smith let down her guard. But is
someone unmotivated by the work that makes her important really the best person to capture what
matters about Smith? The film is elusive and beautiful but after 11 years with unimaginable access,
it falls far short of what might have been. Also out: Frontrunners  ($29.95; Oscilloscope), a look at
kids running for student body president at Stuyvesant High in NYC; The Point Of LeastResistance/The Right Way  ($24.98; Icarus), two Swiss artists who dress up in animal costumes
(Rat and Bear) and meander about;  The End Of America  ($29.95; Indiepix), the director's cut of
the documentary about Naomi Wolf's argument that democracy itself was threatened during theBush years; MGM: When The Lion Roars  ($29.95; MGM), a Patrick Stewart narrated six hour
romp through the MGM archives with loads and loads of classic clips, a la That's Entertainment;
Blindsight  ($27.98; Image), a look at six blind Tibetan teenagers climbing a mountain near Everest
that manages to be fascinating without leaning on the tiresome effect of being "inspirational;" and
Our Daily Bread ($29.98; Icarus), an extremely well reviewed movie about food production that is
both beautful and fascinating. In sports, you've got Raiders 3 Greatest Games: Super Bowl
Victories ($26.98; Warner Bros./NFL), the complete original broadcasts of their 1977, 1981 and
1984 triumphs; and a wrestling cornucopia with The Twisted Disturbed Life of Kane  ($34.95;
WWE) with more than 2 dozen matches and Starrcade: The Essential Collection  ($34.95; WWE)
with more than 25 matches taken from the 1983-2000 history of the event.
BLURAY  - A solid Western, Appaloosa  has Ed Harris (who also directed) and Viggo Mortensen
teamed up as lawmen dealing with Harris's mercurial, angle-seeking girlfriend Renee Zellwegger
and Jeremy Irons as a foppish baddie. Quiet, observant fun. It's $35.99 on BluRay versus $28.98on regular DVD from New Line. Even on sale on Amazon, there's a big $8 difference. It's a goodlooking movie, but that's no way to launch a new format. Swing Vote  ($34.99 on BluRay versus
$29.99; Touchstone) is closer in price but there's no reason for even a $5 difference whenpurchasing this Capra-esque comedy about Kevin Costner, a voter who suddenly finds himself withthe power to choose the next President. Happily, we didn't need this wish fulfillment in 2008.Without A Paddle: Nature's Calling ($36.99 on BluRay versus $29.98; Paramount) a dumb sequelto a dumb original movie that at least had the benefit of a fun cast led by Seth Green. The sequeldoesn't have Green or even a nominal link to the original or any reason for being. If you must, rentit. Also out: Luke Wilson's sentimental drama Henry Poole Is Here  ($39.98 on BluRay versus
$29.98 on regular DVD though Amazon has it on sale for $14, which is $6 LESS than the regular;Anchor Bay); Mark Wahlberg's revenge fantasy Max Payne  ($39.98 on BluRay versus $34.98 for
the equivalent regular DVD special edition); Kiefer Sutherland's horror suspenser Mirrors  ($39.99
on BluRay, an absurd $10 more than the regular DVD; Fox); and finally the gem of a comedyElection  ($29.99 on BluRay; Paramount), a terrific film that made Reese Witherspoon a star. Too
bad it's listed at THREE TIMES the cost of the regular DVD (which is now discounted at $9.98and even on sale on Amazon costs twice as much. Prices do need to come down quickly if BluRayhas a hope of surviving.
MOVIES  -- Brideshead Revisited  ($29.99; Miramax) is a woebegone attempt to remake the
classic novel that was captured nigh on perfectly in the brilliant miniseries. I can't think of a single
novel that was given the definitive version via a miniseries and then was later remade into a twohour feature film that had any reason for being, much less outdoing the miniseries. If you've got 12hours or so to tell a story and do it wonderfully, how can anyone hope to top it with a two hour

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Should Obama Watch?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-should-obama-wa_b_159411.html [4/5/2009 12:35:35 PM]film? It's possible, I suppose, but awfully difficult. This version, which mildly downplays the
homoerotic subtext of the miniseries (and book), doesn't come close despite a fine cast includingEmma Thompson, Michael Gambon, Ben Whishaw and Matthew Goode. If you can't answer thequestion "why are we making this again and what can we do better than the last one?" thenperhaps you shouldn't. Also out: Jackie Chan's terrifically fun Supercop  ($18.99;
Weinstein/Genius);  Taxi Blues  ($24.98; Koch), a well-reviewed glimpse into the Wild West
atmosphere of Putin's Russia; two Audrey Hepburn films nicely remastered -- Funny Face ($24.99which is $10 more than the 50th anniversary edition put out just two years ago; Paramount), asweet film despite the creepy age difference between her and Fred Astaire and Breakfast atTiffany's  ($24.99 -- $12 more than the version put out just two years ago and do they really think
DVD prices should be rising?; Paramount), which is half delightful and half so racially insensitiveeven David Dukes would blush; horror franchise hits My Bloody Valentine  ($19.98;
Lionsgate/Paramount) and Saw V Unrated Collector's Edition  ($39.95; Lionsgate), which has
really fun packaging; cult in the making Repo: The Genetic Opera  ($19.98; Lionsgate); the
inexplicably successful monster movie franchise Underworld & Underworld Evolution DoubleFeature ($19.94; Sony); Gordon Scott's b-movie sword and sandal flick Samson and the 7 Miracles
($19.98; Retromedia) with a bonus of an entire other movie Ali Baba and the 7 Saracens that Scotthas nothing to do with but at least has the number "7" in its title for continuity's sake; Brick Lane($28.96; Sony), a so-so adaptation of the fine novel by Monica Ali; the dumb rom-com My BestFriend's Girl  ($29.95; Lionsgate) starring Dane Cook; the costumer The Children Of Huang Shi
($28.96; Sony); The Express  ($29.98; Universal), the story of Ernie Davis, the first black athlete to
win the Heisman with Dennis Quaid as the coach who pushes him along; and On Each Side($24.95; First Run Features), an Argentian film about the lives transformed while a bridge is beingbuilt between two cities over a period of years.
TV -- I'll bet Barack and Michelle Obama's daughters would enjoy The Powerpuff Girls: 10th
Anniversary Collection  ($59.98; Warner Bros.). It collects together all 78 episodes starring
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup, the three pint-sized but tough crime fighters. Extras include a
new episode, a special about the show, the holiday special, a poster and more. saturday morning is
still a wasteland if you're looking for independent, smart female role models who can take care of
themselves and yet are genuinely human. All that in a silly, amusing cartoon series? Yep. Also out:
The American Future: A History  ($34.98; BBC Video), the latest documentary churned out by
Schama (and yes, that's the word), with the popular historian looking a bit adrift as he tackles
American culture and history; Chris Rock's Kill The Messenger Collector's Edition  ($29.98; HBO),
his latest funny stand-up show which has some great extras -- you see the entire performance in
three cities (Johannesburg, London and New York City), plus a chat with Rock and a digital copy;George Wallace Special Edition  ($24.98; Warner Bros.), the Emmy-winning miniseries starring
Gary Sinise in the role of his life as Alabama governor Wallace, who ultimately abandoned everyhateful principle he held dear (getting shot and losing elections will do that to a man); Make 'EmLaugh: The Funny Business Of America  ($34.95; Rhino), a six part PBS series hosted by Billy
Crystal and narrated by Amy Sedaris about comedy that like most such series is more notable forthe great clips than the context the show places them in; Captains and the Kings ($39.98; Koch),the soapy miniseries starring Perry King, Blair Brown and Henry Fonda from back in the day whenthey turned these out like clockwork;  Lovejoy Season Four  ($69.98; BBC Video), the latest
installment in Ian McShane's star-making turn as the antique dealer/crime fighter; SaxondaleComplete Seasons 1 & 2 ($39.98; BBC Video), Steve Coogan's roadie/philosopher series -- it wasAlan Partridge  that made him famous forever in the UK but this show is an enjoyable goof as well;
Tess Of The D'Ubervilles  ($34.98; BBC Video), the latest version of the Thomas Hardy novel that -
- like Brideshead Revisited  -- has no reason for being other than the fact that it's been a few years
since the last one; Little Britain USA ($29.98; HBO), the UK sketch show that hasn't quitetranslated -- it seems more a collection of grotesqueries than characters they care about or areinterested in; The Last Detective Complete Collection  ($99.99; Acorn) is the third successful series
starring Peter Davison, who previously had fun with Dr. Who and especially All Creatures Greatand Small; This American Life Season Two  ($18.99; Showtime/Paramount), a delightful series
that unfortunately is only for sale at Borders -- boy, do I hate these exclusive agreements; 'TilDeath Second Season  ($29.95; Sony), the Brad Garrett sitcom that is no Raymond , I'm afraid;
Matlock Second Season and Conan's favorite show Walker Texas Ranger Sixth Season  both come
complete ($49.99; Paramount) so why do they tease out My Three Sons First Season Volume Two($39.98; Paramount) which means it'll cost $80 to buy one season of a show that's almost 50 yearsold?; Emergency! Season Five  ($39.98; Universal) seemed pulse-pounding at the time, though
now thanks to ER  et al I keep thinking, 'Hurry Up!;' History Channel has a gift for attention-
