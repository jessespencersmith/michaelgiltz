<p>TREME COMPLETE FIRST SEASON  ($79.98 BluRay; $59.99 regular DVD; HBO) -- The new season
of Treme  begins on HBO April 24. The great cast and the track record of the people behind it (they did
The Wire , a show I can confidently refer to as one of the best of all time and know it's true) mean I'll
probably keep watching. But this look at New Orleans post-Katrina is one of the most frustrating shows
I've ever watched. Half the storylines are low-key and engrossing -- a trombonist scrambling for gigs, alocal Indian chief rebuilding his life and upholding traditions, one woman running a bar and the other arestaurant who both must deal with endless roadblocks. The other half of the show is filled withuninvolving storylines that make no sense whatsoever -- street musicians who wander about avoidingwork, a goofball who runs for local office and then bizarrely stops despite loving the attention and evenmaking money off a campaign song, a professor and writer who gains fame via his rants on YouTube. Ihave friends who love New Orleans and can tell me the specific source for every storyline and every plot
twist, but the one basic rule of storytelling is that it's no defense to when a story makes no sense to
respond, "But it happened!" Yet, what a cast! The great Khandi Alexander gets a role worthy of hertalents as the bar owner, Wendell Pierce is funny and wonderful as the trombonist who juggles numerouswomen; and Clarke Peters is subtle and moving as the Indian chief. The white roles and actors invariablycome off weaker, including John Goodman, Melissa Leo and Steve Zahn. (It's the writing, not them.) Theexception is Kim Dickens as the restaurant owner, perhaps the only one in New Orleans who doesn'tknow when setting up an outdoor cooking business that you must always be prepared for rapid changesin weather. I could spend days mapping out exactly what frustrated me this first season. Hopefully, I'llwatch in season two as they pull it together and deliver the show I know they are capable of producing.
TANGLED  ($39.99 BluRay combo or $29.99 regular DVD; Disney) -- It's been more than a decade since
Disney (not Pixar) delivered a wholly satisfying animated movie. That was 1999's blockbuster Tarzan  and
now it's joined by Tangleda  a spin on Rapunzel. It's not absolute peak Disney, but it's very solid fun from
start to finish, with Many Moore's Rapunzel given a far more active role than in the fairy tale, ZacharyLevi very winning as the thief with a heart of gold Flynn Rider, and a raft of good songsby Alan Menken.A spotlight must be shone on the horse Maximus. This non-speaking role steals the show from the veryfirst moment he bursts onto the screen. Part bloodhound, part Inspector Javert and all hero, Maximus is

<p>tracking down Flynn but teams up with him and Rapunzel to see justice down. He is one of the most
vivid characters in recent memory and everyone involved in creating him deserves applause. Often, one ormore people will be in charge of a certain character's animation. On this film, I only see a credit for fourpeople overseeing all the characters: Jin Kim, Glen Keane, Shiyoon Kim and Bill Schwab. They and thewriters and sound people and others involved in bringing Maximus to life did a sterling job. Heck, hedeserves his own short or spin-off series. I hate to think we'll never see Maximus again.
ARTHUR/ARTHUR 2 ON THE ROCKS ($19.98 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- If you own a Bluray player,you can finally -- finally! -- watch this delightful, Oscar-winning comedy in widescreen, the way it wasshot. Dudley Moore, Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud all enjoyed career peaks thanks to a brilliant,hilarious script by writer-director Steve Gordon. It's a bittersweet, slightly melancholy but always veryfunny movie about a billionaire who discovers true love with a waitress. I wrote at length about theremake  when it was shooting in New York. The original was my favorite movie of 1981  and remains one I
can never watch enough. Will I see the remake? No, unless it gets such rapturous reviews I feelcompelled. Heck, I never even saw Arthur 2: Arthur On The Rocks  because it seemed so unnecessary.
It's included on this modestly priced double feature which has no extras to speak of other than theoriginal trailer.
TRON: LEGACY/TRON: THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC COMBO  ($79.99 BluRay combo; Disney) --
While Arthur is a terrible movie to remake, Tron is a perfect one. The original had a cool concept, lots ofname recognition but wasn't actually any good. Unfortunately, the reboot isn't any better but boy doesthis set offer everything you could possibly want. You get a BluRay version of the new film in 3-D and 2-D and a 2-D version on a regular DVD plus a digital copy AND a DVD of the original film! Plus, needlessto say, loads and loads of extras. Various other editions offer the new movie in less expensive and regular
DVD only versions, but they're too numerous to mention. Undoubtedly in another 20 or so years
someone will try again with this one. Life inside a computer is just too natural an idea not to explore andwe do it more and more every day anyway. Maybe they'll do a comic spin by landing our hero in Twitterand force all dialogue to be limited to 140 characters? Just a thought.

<p>TOPSY-TURVY/THE MIKADO  ($39.95 each on BluRay; Criterion) -- These two BluRay releases
create one of the most delightful double bills imaginable. First comes Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy, a look
at operetta impresarios Gilbert & Sulivan as they create their masterpiece The Mikado. Leigh has createdmany films I love (incuding Another Year, which comes out on DVD June 7). But this atypical 2 hour and40 minute drama is his masterpiece. It's filled with a love of theater and actors and the act of creation.Then you can turn to the 1939 movie The Mikado which features members of D'Oyly Carte OperaCompany, the troupe G&S founded to showcase their work. It's a rare bauble of a film from the greatestyear in Hollywood history, both stage-bound and effervescent. Then comes the real shocker: the usually
gruff and abrupt Leigh (who hates doing press) is warm and forthcoming when discussing this 1939
movie. He shares his opinion and even politely offers up countering opinions of others about the casting,the addition of scenes and other marginalia. His passion and love for G&S shines through. Both moviesare presented with the usual Criterion care and a bevy of insightful extras.

<p>BLACK SWAN  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular; FOX) -- This is unquestionably one of the success
stories of 2010: a dance film with a psychological bent a la Polanski that proved a hit with critics and a
genuine worldwide smash hit. It cost $13 million to make and grossed an astonishing $292 million
worldwide. The story of a prima ballerina who is going mad under the pressure of performance, it
contains some fun spicy work by Mila Kunis and an effective Barbara Hershey. I found the whole thing
rather silly but many, many people disagree with me and I'm glad a clearly ambitious serious film provedso successful, even winning an Academy Award for star Natalie Portman. That can only mean good thingsfor director Darren Aronofsky and his mercurial career.
UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION  ($199.99; Acorn) -- One of the all-
time greats, this TV series is one to savor. The unexpected batch of new episodes begins on PBS thisSunday. Longtime fans and newcomers should all dive into the original which goes from black and whiteto color but always maintains the highest standards of acting and writing. (Production is another matter.On early episodes, the sets are so rickety I sometimes fear if an actor leaned against a wall it wouldtopple over.) This set contains all five seasons, which are marvelous from start to finish. I'm not quiteready to rewatch the series. But this set is bursting with extras, including one hour retrospectives forevery season that go into delicious detail about studio machinations, infighting, changes to stories and
characters and other dish that fans will love. it also includes the 25th anniversary retrospective and audio
commentaries for 24 episodes. And yet I still don't know why Eileen Atkins isn't anywhere to be heardfrom. (If I missed her in all the wealth of extras, you'll understand.) On a negative note, the show is longoverdue for remastering but does not get it here. Picture and sound are fine but should have been better.</p>
<p>I LOVE YOU, PHILLIP MORRIS  ($39.98 BluRay or $27.98 regular DVD; Lionsgate) -- Is it possible
to over-emphasize chemistry? It's a magical blending of two actors that can't really be predicted even
with screen tests and readings. You just never know. This film by the writers of Bad Santa  stars Jim
Carrey and Ewan McGregor as two prison inmates who fall in love. Carrey is an inveterate con man andgives McGregor the lavish life Carrey believes they deserve. But Carrey's illegal activities keep getting himthrown into jail and away from his love. That's unacceptable so he begins a series of clever prison escapesthat made him famous and shamed the Texas jail system to no end. Did I mention this really happened?Skipping blithely between comedy and drama, the film has some clever sequences and great scams. Butthrough no fault of their own, I never bought that Carrey and McGregor were lovers. It's not out of anyfear from them about getting physical; they just don't have any spark. Without that passion, nothing
really matters. But the film does have some very fun moments, including mockeries of golf and Texas
that won't be forgotten any time soon.
MAD MEN SEASON FOUR  ($49.98; Lionsgate) -- For some reason, studios delay putting out season
boxed sets until right before the next season begins. That, of course, gives new fans very little time toplunge into a show and get up to speed so they can watch the new season. It also gives current fans verylittle time to reacquaint themselves with what happened previously. In the UK, they get the season boxedsets out as soon as the current run is over, giving fans the maximum amount of time to commit to ashow. But in the US? You get Treme  a few weeks before the new season starts. And you get Mad Men  a
few weeks before they THOUGHT the new season would start. But because negotiations hit some snags,the fifth season of Mad Men  won't be airing until March of 2012. So we unexpectedly get a chance to deal
with Season Four almost a year before the new one begins. Me, I've long found the show flawed bythinking it should be a Peyton Place-style melodrama and dread all flashbacks to Don Draper'schildhood. Whenever an episode actually focuses on work (like the classic all-nighter pulled by Don andPeggy in episode 7 "The Suitcase") the show comes to life. But whatever its shortcomings, the excellentcast keeps me coming back. The regular DVD packaging, by the way, is notably chintzy and awkward todeal with.</p>
<p>WHO'S THE CABOOSE?  ($19.95; Flatiron/New Video) -- This mockumentary spoofs the pilot season
when actors scramble to get cast in one of the dozens and dozens of sitcoms and dramas that get to shoot
an initial episode and hope they get picked up by a network. It's mainly a testament to how smart youngtalent often surrounds themselves -- or simply becomes friends with -- other talented people. Hence, thismovie stars Sarah Silverman and also features about-to-be-ready-for-primetime talent like David Cross,Andy Dick, Kathy Griffin and H. Jon Benhjamin in a story co-written, directed and starring Sam Seder ofHome Movies.</p>
<p>DENNIS THE MENACE SEASON ONE  ($29.93; Shout) -- It's easy to see why this mild sitcom was
such an instant hit. Dennis was a lovable but frustrating kid who got into wholesome scrapes (breaking a
vase, letting a dog get loose, "helping' his neighbor Mr. Wilson) that frustrated everyone around him.That was literally it. No one ever changed or grew, nothing ever happened. Every week Dennis wouldinnocently create some mishap and his parents would hold their heads and Mr. Wilson would shake hisfist. It made the series a Top 20 hit for three seasons, until even fans grew tired of the repetitiveness andit quickly faded away. But for fans of the scamp Jay North, Shout delivers all 32 episodes of season one ingood shape and at a very reasonable price, along with some extras like a cross-over episode with The
Donna Reed Show. Fans of the comic should definitely check out Hank Ketcham's collected works,
lovingly presented by Fantagraphics. The jokes are just as familiar but his draftsmanship lifts it to highart.
THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES COLLECTION  ($129.98 BluRay; MPI) -- This collection
presents all 14 of the Basil Rathbone films. Twelve of them were beautifully restored by the UCLA Flm &Television Archive. The first and best movies -- The Hounds Of The Baskervilles  and The Adventures of</p>

From Jail After...Sherlock Holmes , both from 1939 -- were NOT remastered but look fine. It's definitely a case of
diminishing returns but Rathbone and Nigel Bruce put their indelible stamps on these roles and it's a
pleasure to have all 14 in one compact collection that takes up the space of a single standard DVD. Extrasinclude six audio commentaries by scholars (including one new one) and film footage of author Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle. I still get a thrill out of knowing I'm probably enjoying a better print and image at
home on my plasma tv than most fans saw in movie theaters some 70 years ago.
THE ALAN BENNETT COLLECTION  ($54.98; BBC/2Entertain) -- Here's a long-overdue set. Alan
Bennett is a beloved figure in the UK with no equivalent I can think of in America. He was a
groundbreaking comic in his youth, became a major dramatist, delivered sterling work on radio and, asan aside, one of the most popular chroniclers of British life via his memoirs and other pieces both writtenand performed. He also produced brilliant television and this set covers some of his best, including theacclaimed but long unavailable movie An Englishman Abroad. That story of a disgraced British spy forthe Soviets living in Moscow wasn't the masterpiece I hoped for but certainly worth seeing, as iseverything here, which features sterling talent like Danie Day Lewis, Alan Bates, Janet McTeer and manyothers. Now if we could only get a complete set of his TV masterpiece Talking Heads I could rest easy.

Wow... I absolutely love everything about Treme. To me, it's the best drama on TV in the last 15
years -- yes, better than The Wire or The Sopranos.
Thanks for commenting . Glad you're enjoying the show.
Treme is a great show if you "get" New Orleans. I guess you just don't get her. Luckily, I do and I
love the dvd. To each their own.Recency  |  Popularity

359 FansI've only been to New Orleans a few times so I'm not hardcore expert like some of my
friends. But I absolutely loved it; went in the off season. I would have moved thereimmediatel y after my first visit if I wasn't convinced I would sink into a mellow, worry about
work tomorrow routine in about five seconds flat. It's a wonderful place for doing nothing,which I'm prone to. I know every plot line has its basis in reality but that doesn't mean itmakes for good storytelli ng. I know some real street musicians are snobs and won't play
anyone else's music or do studio work but that doesn't mean they convinced me of why thetwo street musicians on this show behaved the way they did. She didn't seem "above"doing studio work when offered a chance to record and get an album credit and make somemoney, she just seemed indifferen t in a way that puzzled me. I didn't get those two at all.
Again, half the storylines were just wonderful. But why did Steve Zahn drop the political
campaign when he loved the attention and was making money? If he was worried a
genuine candidate might get blocked by his siphoning off votes, couldn't he have said so? If
it was for the 'free pass," I say, really? Not when he was having fun. It was completely
inexplicab le to me, no matter what the real guy did.
Part One:LOL! Don't worry about it, Michael. I am a New Orleanian, and I don't understandan America that could leave one of their own cities to rot for years after beingdestroyed. So you see, we are equal. Anyway, let me try to answer you questions,
1,) A wonderful place for doing NOTHING??? Is enjoying the moments of your life
nothing? In the end, those moments are all you have and to do it right takesenergy, presence and creativity . I would say that is more than nothing. 2,) You say
that "Treme" is not good story telling, even if it is telling the truth. I lived Katrinaand the years afterwards and it is epic story telling. It is the story of struggle,abandonmen t and bravery in the face of it. That is the truth and I think David
Simon has done it justice. 3,)Those street musicians are outsiders, but, anyway,
money is not the great motivator in the culture of New Orleans, It used to be the
enjoyment of the life of the city and in family, but Katrina added the insistance onthe survival of the culture itself. We have seen what life is like without it. That isnot an option for us.
Part Two:
And finally 4,) Davis. LOL! I really laughed at this one. I am part of a blog called
"Back of Town". It involves mostly a group of bloggers that fought for the city post
Katrina. The John Goodman character is particiall y based on one of them, Anyway,
they had a poll early on on the characters , Davis had 4% approval. I voted for him!
That is another characteri zation of New Orleanians . We like our characters ! They
provide the entertainm ent in life. Davis is harmless. Enjoy his antics, He is the
smile in the theater masks of Thalia and Melpomene. See you next season! (Well,in your case, maybe not.) I hope you make it. You may be surprised.
Look, I have yet to see "Treme". I'm just too busy living that wonderful South-of-I -
10 Luzianna life to watch that much TV. 
I gotta clean up the kitchen after making curry cream butternut squash and coconut
milk soup and and backyard lettuce salad. Last week we had fresh Pontchartr ain
flounder fillets with homemade Hollandais e and a Spanish Tarragon garnish. We
caught the flounder and grew the tarragon. And I gotta get up mighty early to trollthe Trestles for specs and flounder before the wind kicks up whitecaps on big Lake
Pontchartr ain. And that's just fishing and food. I don't even indulge in music andMichael Giltz    03:33 PM on 4/10/2011

78 Fansnightlife. Much.
But I will get around to renting Treme. Eventually .
As a former New Orleanian, my guess as to why N.O. characters seem indifferen t
to success is that at the end of the day, they calculate success differentl y than the
rest of America. 
It just ain't all about money, folks. There truly are some things money ---well lots of
it anyway---j ust can't buy. 
Life in South Louisiana is one of them.
Must agree with you on Dudley Moore's Arthur.
Haven't seen it in years and now can't wait to get my hands on it.
Disagree on Treme and Black Swan.They are both marvelous.I love the total unpredicta bility of Treme.
Real life does just start and stop.
And Melissa Leo is doing some of her best and yet most understate d work.
It's almost hard to imagine she's the same woman who won an Oscar for the Fighter.
Black Swan is a Horror masterpiec e pure and simple.
They come very few and far between.I've never heard of Alan Bennett.Must find out more.Thanks again MG.
Thanks for commenting . Certainly Treme is intelligen tly made with a great cast; glad you're
enjoying it.
