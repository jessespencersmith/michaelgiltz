            <p>F R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 7 ,  2 0 0 6Joe Roth On PixarJoe Roth speaks out about Disney buying Pixar and makes the samepoint Popsurfing did when the deal was announced: this is really aboutPixar taking over Disney (at least Disney animation and maybe thetheme parks). (Roth has been a studio honcho and film producer anddirector and sits on the board of Pixar.) He makes two odd assertions,however. First, Roth says he wouldn't be surprised if five years downthe road Disney was releasing two animated movies a year -- one aPixar original and the other a Pixar sequel. That's pretty dumb since itmeans Disney would abandon the Disney brand and never make anymovies outside the Pixar aesthetic, like stop-motion or hand-drawnmovies. Pixar's people are too smart to think there's only one "type" ofanimated movie to make. Pixar movies don't succeed because they'reCGI; they work because they are creative and have solid stories.Second, Roth says we can expect sequels to The Incredibles, Toy Story,Monsters Inc., Little Nemo and so on. Hasn't Roth been listening? Thatwas a dealbreaker for Pixar. They didn't want ANY sequel made unlessit made sense and was justified creatively. The last thing they would dois churn out annual sequels to all their movies. And that's why they'llflourish creatively.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

1  C O M M E N T S :Anonymous said...Wasn't Disney's threat to make cheapo direct-to-DVD sequels to allthose Pixar movies driving them to drink? I certainly didn't get the ideaPixar WANTED to make sequels and just wanted to keep Disney'shands off them. They seemed to think sequels were unnecessary formost of their films. A sequel can be easily imagined for The Incredibles,for example. But Finding Nemo? Monsters Inc? Those would probablybe stretching it. And Toy Story 3? Only if they have an undeniably greatidea. What can Roth be talking about? If Pixar gets its way, most ofthose sequels will never be made.9:27 AM
