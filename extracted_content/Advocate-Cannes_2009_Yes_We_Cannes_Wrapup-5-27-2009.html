Yes, We Cannes
The annual Cannes Film Festival never fails to combine a sampling of the best in
cinema with the not-as-great.
By Michael Giltz
An Advocate.com exclusive posted  May 27, 2009
The big news at the 2009
Cannes Film Festival -- at
least for queer cineasts --was the ho-hum reception
to new films from Pedro
Almodóvar and Ang Lee andthe breakout success of
Montreal's out talent Xavier
Dolan. Dolan wrote,directed, and stars in I
Killed My Mother,  a
blisteringly funny account of
a mother and son’s love-
hate (or, more often, hate-
hate) relationship. Itdominated the Directors'
Fortnight, winning three top
prizes, including best
French-language film and best first or second feature.
Dolan’s film will play at the Toronto Film Festival this fall and is rumored to be in the running for
the New York Film Festival (which selects only the cream of the crop from other festivals around
the world). Confident, handsome, and charming, with just the dash of ego needed for a director,
Dolan proved himself a serious talent and is certain to be making films for years to come.
Almodóvar’s Broken Embraces  came and went in the competition without causing much of a fuss.
Starring Penélope Cruz, it features his currently typical mix of melodrama (involving a blind
director turned screenwriter, a secretary turned mistress, an angry gay son turned would-bedirector, a dead titan of industry) that adds up to much less than the sum of its parts. Critics
shrugged after checking with each other to see if they'd missed something. Was that all there
was, they asked? Yep. On the other hand, the brochure that was distributed to the press to
promote the film was by far the most lavish and eye-catching of the fest -- it looked more like a
fabulous edition of Vogue  than something as banal as a promotional item. Almodóvar still has
style.
Lee's mild, amiable Taking Woodstock  has a gay central role played by Demetri Martin, and that
alone is cause for celebration among his gay fans. It tells the modestly diverting story of a closeted
young gay man in the 1960s helping his parents with their ramshackle Catskills hotel when
Woodstock comes to town and upends their lives. It too barely caused a ripple even among serious
Lee fans and seemed more like a throat-clearing by Lee (who had made a string of serious films)than a substantial work.
