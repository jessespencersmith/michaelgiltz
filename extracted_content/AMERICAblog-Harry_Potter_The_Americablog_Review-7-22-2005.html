7/22/2005 01:45:00 PM"HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE"By J.K. Rowling**** (out of 4)By Michael GiltzNO SPOILERS!!Okay, I won't discuss the novel at length, to avoid spoiling it forfans who haven't finished it yet. Suffice to say, I think it's a bigimprovement on the last two (which felt a bit self-indulgent).Briefly, the first book was an unexpected delight. The secondand third were good, but felt like Rowling was slipping intoformula. The fourth and fifth ended that formula, but you gotthe impression an editor didn't come within a mile of thosedoorstoppers -- if Rowling thought of it, she put it in."Half-Blood Prince" is much more focused and streamlined.Plus, Harry isn't so teen angsty anymore, so he doesn't speakIN CAPITAL LETTERS any more, which is quite a relief. It'srestored my faith in the series and made me painfully eager forthe final book.But why are we discussing this at Americablog? As a number ofpeople have pointed out, it's very much a post 9-11 (and sadly,post 7-7) book, with the government clamping down on rights,people suspicious of one another and fear everywhere.There's a rather clueless prime minister seen in the very firstchapter who is informed by the real powers behind the countryabout what is going on. It's easy to see him as a mild dig atBush.But one element -- that doesn't spoil the plot at all -- involvespeople thrown into jail by the wizards in power. As Dumbledoreand Harry discuss it, some of those people are completelyinnocent AND THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT. But they leavethose people to rot in jail because they're desperate to be seenas doing SOMETHING to fight the terrorists...pardon me, Imean the Death Eaters. Harry knows this is wrong and says so.So think about that. Millions of kids around the world havebeen reading and respecting Harry Potter. They probably can'timagine anyone in the real world would ever do something likeleaving people they KNOW are innocent to rot in jail. And whenthese young people realize it's actually being done this verymoment by their own government, they'll say, quite simply,"That's not right!"No wonder the far right radicals try to ban "Harry Potter" fromschool libraries. No wonder Pope Benedict thinks it's dangerousfor children to be "seduced" into questioning authority andthinking on their own when making moral decisions, ratherthan just blindly accepting what they're told.Thank you, J.K. Rowling.
