9/05/2005 04:43:00 PMWolf Blitzer on CNN just showed footage of Air Force Onetaking off from another photo op in Mississippi and this isexactly what he said:Air Force One is taking off from near Gulfport, Mississippi onits way back to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.The President has been in the region touring once again. Hewas in the region on Friday. He came back todaycancelling so many of his plans for Labor Day, ALL ofhis plans for Labor Day and for so much of the monthof September as he focuses in now one week after thishurricane struck almost exclusively on this tragedy, on thishorrible, horrible situation.Well, guess what: the people of New Orleans had to cancel theirLabor Day plans as well. Really, is Blitzer out of his mind? Bushcancelled his plans for Labor Day? The man just spent five weeks inCrawford, Texas on one of the longest Presidential vacations inhistory. For God's sake, how pathetic is the MSM, trumpeting Bushcancelling his plans for a holiday weekend as if he's made majorsacrifice instead of telling people again and again that during the firstcrucial three days of this disaster when the federal government failedcompletely and people died unnecessarily, BUSH STAYED ONVACATION. How low are they going to lower the bar for this man?Bush cancelled his plans for Labor Day??!!?? Email Wolf Blitzer here.Unbelievable.
