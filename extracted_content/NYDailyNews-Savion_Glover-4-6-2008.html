Hoofer Savion
Glover brings his
unique tap style to
Hadem's legendary
Apollo Theater next
Sunday.BY MICHAEL GIIJTZ
N $ e is arguably the dancer most responsible
N $ for keeping the tap tradition alive, yet
ffi Savion Glover never saw some of the leg-
N $ endaryhooferswho graced the stage of the
N N Apollo Theater.
"I didn't have the chance," says Glove4 34.
That's probably because he was too busy making
dance history himself. The Newark native debuted
on Broadway at the age of 10 in "The Tap Dance
Kid," became one of the youngest performers ever
nominated for a Tony - at l5 - in "Black and
Blue," and starred in the landmark, Tony-winning
"Bring in'da Noise, Bring in'da Funk" in 1996.
On Sunday, Gloverbrings his unique, urban-
ized style of tap to the Apollo in Harlem with "Bare
Soundz," an improvisational performance featur-
ing him, two other dancers and gospel singer lori
Ann Hunter.
Part of the Apollo Family Series (with tickets
priced at $12), it's Glover's latest effort to share his
life-long passion for tap with a younger generation.
"It's been l0 years since'Noise/Funk,'and I
think the dance has remained visible," says Glover.
"We've obviously done something to make peoplestop saying that this is a dyrng art form, orthat
'You've brung back tap dancing.' I don't hear those
types of things anymore."
Though Glover appeared on "Sesame Street"
throughout the early 1990s and wrote a biogra-
phy in 2000 titled "Savion! My Life in Tap" that was
geared toward young people, probably his biggest
impact on kids came when he choreographed and
"danced" the role of Mumble in the 2006 animated
hit "HappyFeet."
"It was cool," says Glover of the movie, about a
tap-dancing penguin who saves his colony through
his unique talent. "I didn't know what to expect. But
after I got used to it, it was just tunny."
His next goal is to open a dance school at the
Newark Community School of the Arts, which he
attended as a child.
"I'm continuing the educational process of get-
ting people to accept dance as music," he says. "I'm
going to be taking my production company there,
and also my tap school. We won't otferballet or jazz
or hip hop, or anything like that.
"We will deal with just the art form known to
me as hoofing. It's going to be my planet over
there," adds Glover. "It's going to be, like, Savion
World." <)</p>
