8/11/2004 02:15:00 AMThe Atlantic Monthly (one of the best magazines around) points out inits current September issue that when Donald Rumsfeld became Sec.of Defense, the Department of Defense web site posted "Rumsfeld'sRules" for "government, business and life." Since only subscribers canaccess AM's website, I've posted the rules they republished below."Establish good relations between the departments of Defense andState, the National Security Council, CIA and the Office ofManagement and Budget.""Don't divide the world into 'them' and 'us.' Avoid infatuation with orresentment of the press, the Congress, rivals, or opponents. Acceptthem as facts. They have their jobs and you have yours.""Don't do or say things you would not like to see on the front page ofthe Washington Post.""If you foul up, tell the president and correct it fast. Delay onlycompounds mistakes.""Be able to resign. It will improve your value to the president and dowonders for your performance.""Your performance depends on your people. Select the best, trainthem, and back them. When errors occur, give sharper guidance. Iferrors persist or if the fit feels wrong, help them move on.""It is easier to get into something than to get out of it."Yep, the irony comes fast and furious.
