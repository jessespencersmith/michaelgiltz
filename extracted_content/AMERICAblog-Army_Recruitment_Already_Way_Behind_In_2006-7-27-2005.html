7/27/2005 03:39:00 PMThe Army has already conceded it's going to fall short of its(lowered) goals for 2005. Now USA Today reports the Army isalready dramatically behind its goals for 2006.The pool of recruits who sign up as much as a year beforethey report for training is dwindling. So far, 3,100 havesigned up for 2006, according to Army RecruitingCommand at Fort Knox, Ky. The Army says it hopes tohave 7,200 recruits in the pool by Oct. 1, when the2006 recruiting year begins. By comparison, the Armystarted the 2005 recruiting year with about 14,700recruits in the delayed entry pool.Yeah, right. They're gonna DOUBLE the numer of recruits in the poolin the next nine weeks. Gee, think this shortfall might havesomething to do with the Army's belief that it can (make that "must")start a major pull-out in spring of 2006.
