1/28/2005 04:59:00 PMHere's a good, blistering editorial in today's New York Timesthat mocks Bush and his much ballyhooed plan the MilleniumChallenge Account, which should be doling out $5 billion a yearby 2006 to the poor countries (mostly in Africa and LatinAmerica) that put in place common sense reform and worktowards development. As always, Bush announces big numbersand then quietly cuts back funds after the spotlight moves on.They tubthump this project all over the world as an example ofthe USA doing good. But how much have they doled out sincestarting the MCA last year? Not one dime. Zero. Zip. Nada. Anumber of countries have qualified according to Bush's lackeys,but none of them have seen any greenbacks. This echoes whatBush did about AIDS in Africa -- callously using the worstplague in our lifetimes to pretend he was a compassionateconservative and then DEFUNDING international groupsalready on the ground trying to fight the disease and savelives, refuse to back generic drugs because he'd rather sendfunds to pharmaceutical companies than save three times asmany lives (the cost difference between name brands andgenerics) and finally demanding that science and commonsense be abandoned by refusing to work with any project thatmentions condoms.Paul Krugman details today how Bush lies when he pretendsblack Americans are shortchanged by Social Security. Bush justwants to spend trillions to switch to a privatization plan andhe's willing to con black Americans into thinking the system isstacked against them. (His lie is based on the fact that somany black people die at a young age.) But why let facts get inthe way?
