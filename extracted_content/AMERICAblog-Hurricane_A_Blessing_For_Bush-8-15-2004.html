8/15/2004 03:44:00 PMThis is deeply cynical -- and I have many friends in Florida whoworried their homes might be destroyed -- but I can't help thinkingthe natural disaster Hurrican Charley is a blessing for Bush. It comesright before the election and he gets to tour the state, hang with hisbrother Jeb and pour oodles of money into the state. He's certain todo a better job than his dad, who famously dragged his feet ingetting support to Florida after the devastating Hurricane Andrew. SoBush gets to hand out cash and look Presidential? That could be adeciding factor there.Note to Kerry: laud Bush for acting promptly and then damn him forbacktracking on his promises to New York -- New York has nevergotten the funds Bush promised and his national plan to defend thecountry has been turned into pork barrel, with states that face littleor no threat getting a LOT more money per capita than obvioustargets like New York and Los Angeles and DC that are stilldesperately underfunded, have virtually open ports, etc.Note to bloggers: I address one blogger's complaints at length in thecomments. But let me restate the obvious: I'm noting anuncomfortable but real political fact, just like all the commentatorswho talk about the "bounce" Bush might get if there was an attack onAmerican soil before the election. That isn't politicizing a terroristattack; that's discussing the political ramifications of a real orpotential tragedy. If I had suggested Bush had engineered thehurricane to gain political points, that would be politicizing somethingbeyond his control. (We all know only Pat Robertson can control theweather.) Politically, all I did was say Kerry should continue to pointout the many times when Bush has not responded rapidly in a time ofnational tragedy.
