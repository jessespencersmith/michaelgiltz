Theater: Campbell Scott in "The
Atheist" and Christine Lahti in "ABody Of Water"

Entertainment News
Two terrific film stars are on the stage in New
York, something neither of them do nearlyenough. Like most of the best theater actors, bothCampbell Scott and Christine Lahti have apiercing intelligence that keeps you on your toes.
THE ATHEISTScott stars in the one-man show The Atheist  by
Ronan Noone (a playwright that's new to me) at
the Barrow St. Theatre in New York. AugustineEarly is a sleazy journalist (is that redundant?)
from a white trash background who is determined to make a name for himself one way or another.When he stumbles onto a would-be actress renting an apartment from a politician who secretlyvideotapes her sex-capades, Early couldn't be happier. Squeezing the politician for favors whileplanning to run the story anyway suits Early just fine. The role of an amoral climber suits Scott
just fine, too. He commands the stage easily, drawing us in with the easy charm of someone you
don't trust but can't help enjoy chatting with. Whether battling with an editor who is wedded to
old-fashioned ideas of reporting or sparring with the politician over ethics, Early is compelling in a
sneaky, better-not-turn-your-back-on-him manner.
The name of the show seems misleading. Early talks about losing his religion, but he certainly
hasn't lost his faith: he firmly believes in rapaciously doing anything and everything to help himself.We get some religious trappings, like the moment Early lost his faith (though it really wasn't losingfaith in God but losing faith in trusting others that changed him), not to mention the politician'swife, who is quite a turn-on, especially when she's sitting in church and trying to avoid Early'sadvances. Why not call the show "The Journalist" or "The Reporter?" It would take the weight off astory that really doesn't have issues of faith on its mind. That wouldn't make this familiar story ofsmall-town corruption and small-time power-grabbing more original. But it would lower thepretension level that such a title raises.

<p>Michael Giltz: Theater: Campbell Scott in "The Atheist" and Christine Lahti in "A Body Of Water"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/theater-campbell-scott-in_b_135354.html[4/5/2009 1:20:36 PM]Scott has no pretension in him and turns this low-rent Woodward and Bernstein into a compelling
character. He doesn't oversell Early's charm or his sleaze. Scott chose to keep Early on a short leash
emotionally. It's only when he makes the mistake of opening himself up to feelings that Early
explodes briefly in anger before reining himself back in.
Unfortunately, Scott is completely alone up there. I don't mean the fact that there are no other
actors. I mean the fact that the production design and sound design and directing are all uniformlydull and unhelpful. The backdrop is a generic image (perhaps evoking a window and a tree branch;perhaps not). The random moments when Early's image is projected onto a screen and thenmultiplied again and again into the distance serve no purpose. The musical interludes betweenscenes are noir-ish jazz; those cues might become more frantic as the play progresses but ingeneral any one of the cues could be switched with any other and no one would notice or care. Andfor a play that's only about 90 minutes long, an unnecessary intermission wastes everyone's time.Worst of all, the entire play is presented as a confession and the fears about the too-obvious
direction Early is headed in prove well-founded. Right before the end, Early tells a very effective
story about his mother that ends with a cold comment from her and Early daring the audience to
feel sympathy for him -- the sharp silence that followed his story will be the memory of this play I
walk away with. Too bad they didn't stop there; any good journalist knows you should end with a
kicker.
What others are saying:The New York Times'  Charles Isherwood said: the show has "all the sting of a ten year old tabloid
headline.... Under Justin Waldman's direction Mr. Scott's breezy conviction imbues the writing
with a liveliness that holds the attention, but the inconsistencies and occasional absurdities pile uplike the notebooks littering the floor of the set."
Variety's  Sam Thielman said: "Noone's yarn gets better and better as it rockets along, especially
with Campbell Scott to give the title character a well-placed jolt or two. As Augustine Early, a
newspaper reporter swallowed whole by ambition, Scott has enough hypnotic charisma for aboutfive actors, keeping the aud enthralled by Early's smooth-voiced, friendly facade and occasionallyletting his barely controlled rage smash it to bits."
The Associated Press'  Michael Kuchwara said: "Noone's writing has a rhythmic quality, call it a
staccato lilt, that Scott captures with complete assurance. Nattily dressed in a light suit and tie, the
actor resembles a fast-talking salesman, sort of a darker, nastier version of Professor Harold Hill of"Music Man" fame. And director Justin Waldman never lets the pace of the evening slacken,despite the play's two acts."
Theatremania's  Barbara & Scott Siegel said: "If you see a better performance on a stage in New
York City this year, it will have to surpass the extraordinary work by Campbell Scott in the one-
person play The Atheist, a co-production of the Culture Project and Circle in the Square, now at
the Barrow Street Theatre."
A BODY OF WATERUnlike Campbell Scott, Christine Lahti is not alone up there in Lee Blessing's A Body Of Water  at
Primary Stages. She's one of three actors, but I'm really referring to the technical aspects. The set is
an hypnotic one, with a living room bordered on two sides by visions of a green countryside thatare 3-D in their inviting beauty and a backdrop of a marvelous view of more greenery and thewater (a lake? a river?) of the title. Along with the lighting and sound, it's all elegant and simpleand vaguely mysterious, just like the story.
A description of the play sounds Brechtian or Pinter-esque. Two adults (Christine Lahti and
Michael Christofer) wake up in a home with a wonderful view, seemingly cut off from the world.And they have no idea who either of them are (are they married? friends? siblings?) or what'sgoing on. A young woman later appear (Laura Odeh) who provides them with a string of answers,seemingly whatever fits her mood or perhaps just what might appeal to the two people and keepthem calm.
Happily, the show is not nearly so abstract. The two people are probably married and either they
lost a daughter in a terrible crime or maybe the young woman is their daughter and maybe the wifetried to kill the husband for cheating on her emotionally (she may or may not have found a diary in

<p>Michael Giltz: Theater: Campbell Scott in "The Atheist" and Christine Lahti in "A Body Of Water"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/theater-campbell-scott-in_b_135354.html[4/5/2009 1:20:36 PM]which he detailed her annoyances) or maybe it's something else entirely. And it seems quite clear
that these two people wake up each morning and start all over agan -- their memories are sieves, itseems, and even an hour or two can separate them from whatever facts they've learned or beentold about themselves.
No, you don't get a lot of answers, but the show is so grounded and specific and engagingly
performed that it seems less like an exercise in existentialism and more a genuine exploration of
what it means to be happy. Can two people ever really know each other? What brought them to
this point in their lives? Is joy meaningless or more real if we acknowledge how alone and yet
interconnected we are? It's a credit to Blessing's play that we feel genuinely engaged with such
abstract ideas. It's a modest, intriguing work. I think on a Broadway stage it would feel too blown
up, too important and the weighty metaphysical ideas that are quietly present now would take
over. As it is, in the intimate space of Primary Stages, the show has its ideal setting.
Odeh as the young woman is a bit mannered, but that works just fine for a character that may be a
daughter forced to reenact the same wrenching details over and over again. I was a bit worried
about Christofer, who is better known to me as a playwright ( The Shadow Box) and film writer and
director ( Gia, The Thomas Crown Affair ) than as an actor. But he is very good as Moss, the
disheveled man who is invariably attracted to this compelling, beautiful, funny woman he'sstranded with on an island of no memory.
And who can blame him? Lahti is effortless as Avis, a sexy, confident woman confronting the
frightening circumstance she's found herself in. Early on, she and Moss are alone, trying to figureout if they know each other. He suggests they open their robes and look at each other's body --maybe a birthmark or some such intimate detail will trigger something. Avis amiably distrusts him,but she's no prude and soon agrees. Moss opens his robe and she takes some tongs from thekitchen to move around his privates. After a moment, she says thoughtfully, "Just like apenis...only smaller" before he jumps away in annoyance and the audience laughs. The line isnothing special, but Lahti is so present in the moment, laughing so easily and without malice at herlittle joke that you can't help being won over. Whoever they may be, he's lucky to be trapped withher. Later, Lahti looks so terrific in a blue dress that you can't help feeling a little cheated inretrospect when she flashed him but kept her back to us. In every other respect, Lahti exposesherself fully with the talent and charm we've come to expect from the actor behind movies likeSwing Shift, Housekeeping, Running On Empty and the late, lamented TV drama Jack and Bobby.Look at her credits and you can't help feeling she hasn't been given her due nearly enough in anymedium -- not in the movies, on TV or onstage. Her character might forget herself, but we won'tforget her - Lahti is too good for that to ever happen.
What others have said:
The New York Times'  Charles Isherwood said: "This sputtering drama about a man and a woman
who wake up one day with matching cases of amnesia is ultimately so, er, forgettable that its
resolution ceases to be a matter of suspense long before it arrives.... Ms. Lahti gives a warm
performance (she looks sensational too) and Mr. Cristofer an energetic one, but their charactersnever move beyond fussing over the oddity of their predicament to reveal distinct personalities."
The Daily News'  Joe Dziemianowicz said: three stars out of five. "Staged by Maria Mileaf for
Primary Stages, the production boasts a smooth flow, consistent tone and handsome design. A
rainstorm seems so real you'll want to open an umbrella. Lahti, onstage after a 15-year gap, andCristofer ("The Shadow Box") bring out the couple's confusion and wariness and are quite movingas they reach out to each other."
Variety's  Sam Thielman said: "Blessing's script is unlikely to ruffle any feathers, but the central
insights about intimacy are sneakily disturbing. The couple's rude awakening is an everyday
occurrence (maybe), followed by an exploration of the Edenic world around them (possibly) thatvanishes into the haze of forgetfulness as soon as they go to bed together in the evening, again forthe first time (perhaps). Is the love that blossoms every day between Moss and Avis (convincinglyplayed, especially by Lahti) the real thing, or is it simply better living through that initialchemistry?"
Theatermania's  David Finkle said: "The Edenic view is represented by three huge and captivating
Timothy Arzt paintings -- one upstage, one stage left, one stage right -- that look like something
Henri Rousseau might have rendered as the 20th Century got underway. You look at it and wish
