 American Idol  -- Hollywood Week
Day Three Wins Night
Read More:  American Idol , Ryan Seacrest , Simon Cowell ,
Entertainment News
Idol  won the night with a 13.5 rating, per Marc
Berman of Mediaweek,  though CBS's strong
lineup led by The Mentalist  was a very strong
second. And fans of Fringe should expect a time-
slot switch -- no show holding onto just 43% ofIdol 's audience can expect to stay in place
forever. Idol hit 24.5 million viewers perHollywood Reporter,  down a tad from last week.
The Mentalist,  the biggest new hit drama since
Grey's Anatomy,  I think, hit 19.7 million viewers.
The most telling moment of Tuesday night's
episode wasn't a performance or a backstage glimpse of drama (hey, Tatiana!). It was the voice-over from Ryan Seacrest when discusssing Leneshe Young, a promising singer with a backgroundof grinding poverty. Ryan said Lenesha stole America's heart not just with her singing...but withher story. Really? Because I wouldn't have liked Lenesha's solid performances less if I heard shehad grown up in the Hamptons. And the less I hear about people's wrenching backgrounds andpersonal growth in the face of adversity the more I like it. But that's not Idol . Especially until we
get to the final 12, the Idol episodes aren't edited to highlight the singing. They're edited tohighlight the stories.
72 people began the day and were grouped into four rooms -- with three rooms going forward and
one being sent home. Or as Ryan cruelly put it, sent back to "their everyday lives." It's almost
impossible to judge them fairly because we virtually never saw a complete performance and moreoften than not it was a medley of different people forgetting their lyrics or doing well or whatever.
Adam Lambert  -- sang Cher's "Believe." It could have been a bold choice but it definitely came
across as cabaret to me. The way he sang it just made the song sound gay, in the bad sense of the
word. Just strange.
Matt Giraud  -- played piano and nailed "Georgia On My Mind." We even got a shot of the backup

Song Hits Radiossingers (who were just watching) nodding their heads and smiling throughout. I'd take a lot of
comfort from that any day.
Jamar Rogers and Danny Gokey  -- Jamar again seemed the weaker of the two though still
improving. If only he would lose the giant wallet chain. Danny gave a nice raspy spin on "I Hope
You Dance," apparently the first of MANY covers of that tune.
Anoop Desai, Jorje Nunez and Scott Macintyre  -- a quick medley of all three, with Macintyre
sounding flat and uninteresting to me, especially notable since he was supposed to be more
comfortable than ever when sitting down to the piano to perform.
Kendall Beard, Stevie Wright and Lil Rounds  -- another medley, with Lil Rounds sounding
by far the best.Kristin McNamara  -- a so-so performance and more notable for her chat with Ryan when he
said Nancy (the woman who got fed up with the uber-drama from Kristin and Nathaniel) wanted
to apologize but was just teasing. Shouldn't Kristin apologize to Nancy?
Then loads of people we barely know led by one we know too well: Tatiana Del Toro, who is shown
giving a terrible performance, a relief since it means she'll be going home. She's followed by Alexis
Grace, Kenny Hoffpauer, Jasmine Murray and Nathaniel Marhsall, none of which stand out.
Joanna Pacitti  -- friend of the producers who has already had her songs placed on numerous TV
shows, etc. Pacitti had a record deal that went nowhere. Now she has a second chance and to prove
how stressful Idol can be, she blows it completely by mumbling her lyrics. Followed by a montageof other train wreck performancs by Casey Carlson, Stephen Fowler and Nick Mitchell aka Normanwho jokes his way through another song. Is this Idol or Mad TV?
Anna Marie Boskovich  -- the latest of many to trudge through "I Hope You Dance."
Ju'not Joyner  -- who already has a cool spelling of his name to go with stardom, does a good take
on "Hey There Delilah."Kaylan Loyd  -- Simon ended her song.
Kai Kalama  -- lost his voice
Michael Sarver  -- oil rigger who sounded so-so.
Now imagine being in the room with Tatiana. Even if you think being with her is a good sign
because she's so annoying you might imagine she'll get through for another day (though thecontestants won't know how much airtime she'd get for weeks), still...very annoying to sit with herin a corner, all alone, holding court with herself.
And why did we watch tonight? Did anything make sense? Of course not. Tatiana and Nick
Mitchell got through. As did Joanna Pacitti who completely forgot her lyrics, the one unforgivablesin of Idol. Yes, it was done just to goose ratings -- there's certainly no vocal reason some of thesepeople got through. But before we yell and scream, remember that it's meaningless. More peoplewill be cut tomorrow and then the final 36 will be cut down to the final 12. THAT'S when it starts tomatter who makes it and not a minute before. But still, Tatiana? Have the producers no shame?Entertainment Weekly's Michael Slezak feels your pain.

Please explain to me, "just made the song sound gay, in the bad sense of the word."

"Gay" -- slang, for dumb, goofy awkward, uncool. I'm gay, as in you know, gay, myself. Adam
Lambert's big criticism from the judges has been he's too Broadway, not code for gay as inhomosexual (like they often mean) but too broadway as in theatrical and broad -- fine forsinging "The Impossible Dream" but a bit melodramatic for a pop singer. Singing a hit song bya diva like Cher is certainly no way to prove them wrong, unless you can somehowdramatically makeover the song and reveal some new hidden depths. That's what Adam said
he would do, but in fact his version would have sounded fine on a dance floor or a piano bar.
Hence my use of immature, schoolyard slang for "not good."

Tatiana - excusing her voice, talent and personality, I think she's quite good.

Very funny. She's good for the producers, maybe.
