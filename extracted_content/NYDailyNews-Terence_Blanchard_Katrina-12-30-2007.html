a"It's hard for me to feel it's a break-
through pl ocess because it was almost a
semi-comatose project," says Blanchard,
who began the project by scoring direc-
tor Spike Lee's acclaimed documenta-
ry "When the Levees Broke" in the after-
math of Hurricane Katrina. "l was still
trying to get my mom settled and make
sure she rvars okay "
That project led to his current album,
which includes preces written for that
film, and more pieces by Blmchard, as
well as tunes composed by his long-time
band-members such as bassist Denick
Hodge, who will perfom with Blanchard
at Symphony Space on Jan, 3 lt's paft of
an ongoing series called "Blue Note Re-
cords Live," where musicians chat on-
stage with label head Bruce Lundvall
"ln a certain sense - and I've never
been this type of person - but in a cer-I tain sense you start to feel a bit of an ob- :
: ligation to perform it,'says the 45-year- :
i old father of two who has composed more :
: than 40 film scores as well as numerous :
: jzz albums
"We've been playing it around the :
country and it's made a lol of people re- :
flecl on New Orleans ll's kept the sro- :
ry alive in terms of keeping people aware i
of what's not going on here and some :
of the positive things lhat are going on. :
Bul mostly it's allowed all tlre local peo- :
ple who are strewn about the country to :
come hear this music and moum " :
Blanchard didn't have much time to do :
that himselt when first composing some :
of this music Since I99l s "Jungle Fever," :
he's enjoyed a prolific and satisfying col- :
laboration with Lee akin to some of the :
great Holl)ryood pairings, Iike Bemard :
Herrmann with Alfred Hitchcock or John iGrammy-winning, coolly elegant jazz tnrmpeter, New Or-
Ieans native Terence Blanchard has never made an albumn:
Re-, more heartfelt and moving than "A Tale of God's Wll: A
quiem for Katrina" @lue Note).Williams with Sleven Spielberg
But writing music for the four-hour
HBO documentary that detailed Katrina's
devastating impact on New Orleans was
daunting both literally (the project ex-
panded from two hours to four hours)
and emotionally (one key scene shows
Blanchard and his mother enterins
her flood-ravaged home for the
flrst time)
"Emotionally, it was hard to
deal with," says Blanchmd,
who begins the new album
with the musicians chanting
"This is the tale of God's will"
a la John Coltrane's "A Love
Supreme" and ends with the
poignant track "Dear Mom "
"I didn't want to look at it I just
didn't Theroughpartaboutitwasyou :
couldn't take a break- If I took a break, I'd :
step out the door and I was in the realiff :
ofwhal I was working on " :
But today Blanchard is hopeful While i
talking on the phone, he's on his front :
steps in New Orleans, waying to people :
who walk by, like the woman he some- :
times boxes with. "She hits hard. ex- :tremely hard," laughs Blanchard And
without domplaying the hard work that
needs to be done or the many mistakes
of the past and present, he does look for
the positive effects that might come out of
Katrina
"The local musicims who are here
are really helping to pr eserue the
hopes md aspirations of the
people who live here," says
Blmchtrd '1 /hen I go to
some of these local clubs
with local musicims play-
ing, they're playinB music
that is so energefic, so up,
so helpful, it allows all ol us
to cope
"In the aftermath, you're
starting to see people coming
logether and you're starting to see
people doing things for their community
they would never have done before, and
it is making a dif{erence in how we re-
late with one another. But it's still a slow
process " a
