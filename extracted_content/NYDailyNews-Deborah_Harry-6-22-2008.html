aMermaid role pulls Harry in deep
"The mermaid intrigued me," says
Harry, who loved delivering such lines as,
"Nothing against sea cows, but I'm hardly
a manatee."
Harry also improvised a flirtation during
one scene with the hero, 35-year-old Alby
(Matt McGrath), a husband and father who
idealizes his barelyfinished childhood and
- in a fit of nostalgia - goes on a road trip
to a faded amusement park.
"In real life it would be a beautiful thing
for a person to really embrace what they're
doing so wholeheartedly," says Harry about
her character. "I know it's part of the whole
arrested-development theme, but there's
something beautiful about it and so sweet."
And there's something very satisfying
about touring with Blondie to celebrate the
30th anniversary of their best album, "Par-
allel Lines," which the group will performin its entirety at the Nokia Theater tonight.
The album, which included hits like
"Heart of Glass," just hit the U.K.'s Top 40
again thanks to its showing up in a com-
mercial directed by David Lynch.
But thanks to more recent albums and
hit singles like "Maria," Blondie can avoid
the trap of nostalgia. The band, which was
recently inducted into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, also will play at least bne
song from Har$s2007 album "Necessary
Evil." One listene4 U2's The Edge, consid-
ered it one of the best of the year.
Yet Harry, who became a star thanks
mostly to "Parallel Lines," still has mixed
feelings about the album.
"I'm not totally in love with every song,
but I feel like I can stand up for it," she
says. "I'm proud of the whole thing. That
was a long time ago and the music is really
okay. Some of it's a little melancholic and
sweet. And some of it, I think, 'Well, that
was a ctaztjt person.'"
Which song makes her think that? "I'm
not telling," she says, laughing.
