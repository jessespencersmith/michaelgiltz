7/20/2005 11:18:00 AMYep, gays. The Iraqi people have been watching nightlyconfessions on TV for a while now. But the latest criminal hastruly shocked the nation...not just by the beheading of childrenbut by the even worse crime of kissing other men.Nadia Mohamad, 49, a government employee who waswatching the program with her husband and children whilehaving dinner at the Sky Cafe in downtown Erbil onThursday night, said the beheading of a terrified youth onthe first program - shown before the sex scenes beganappearing - had literally sickened her."The first time I saw it, I vomited, because I couldn'tcontrol myself," Mrs. Mohamad said.But then, she said, she was almost equally shockedwhen the men started stripping and fondling eachother before the scene cut away to Sheik Zana and abouthalf a dozen of his underlings giving confessions againstblank backdrops. "Sex is something sacred for us," Mrs.Mohamad said. "But when we saw them doing that, itbecomes humiliating."It was hard to find anyone who did not express outrage atthe sex scenes when asked about the programs this week."The homosexual part - that's the worst thing," saidArkan Hamza, 27, who was having lunch with a friend atthe Abu Shahab Restaurant on Wednesday.Some people are so upset, they want to believe the videos aredoctored rather than that a Kurd could do such a thing (the kissing,mind you -- no one finds the beheading hard to accept). Nice to knowthat even when you're being terrorized by suicide bombings thateveryone can agree on one thing: gays are worse.
