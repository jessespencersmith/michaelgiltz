One could go on, but suffice to say Pulitzer Prize-winner Steven Millhauser delivers a newcollection of short stories, 16 tales (and "tales" is probably the right word) for shivering and laughing over.What's he like? Perhaps Ray Bradbury or Jorge Luis Borges or John Collier (if you want to seem cool andnamecheck an obscure but appropriate precursor) or The Twilight Zone without the (obvious) moralizing orreally just Steven Millhauser. His stories are rooted in details, the here and now (wherever the here and nowmay be), a place so firmly imagined -- be it a backyard lawn or a palace of dreams -- that you never doubt it for asecond. It's reality, but reality shifts and the strange and uncomfortable always slip in or linger just out ofeyesight. "Coming Soon" is classic Millhauser: a man has moved from the city to an up-and-coming small town.Not a sleepy small town, no thank you, but a place where things are happening. A Saturday morning jaunt to afavored cafe in its bustling downtown allows our narrator to describe the pleasurable improvements taking placehere and there: a new restaurant, an addition to a neighbor's home and so on. But the pace of change quickensand the parade of improvements becomes dizzying. Soon, this quiet town is a frenzy of activity and our herogets lost simply trying to walk home because so many new developments and add-ons have taken place in thepast few minutes. A row of townhouses replace a park perhaps or homes are remodeled beyond recognition andon and on. Desperate to orient himself, he's in his car now, trying to find his way. Construction is everywhere,even on his own block. Change is now a constant and our hero barely knows where he is anymore. Panicked,he asks for directions from a man in a hard hat and is sent fleeing up a newly built ramp onto a newly builthighway headed God knows where. It's disturbing, bewildering, scary...and funny. And it can't be spoiled bydescribing it because Millhauser's writing is so diamond-sharp and distinctive. "Phantoms" uses one of hisfavorite devices -- a report or summary or some such official document -- to describe a town where peopleapparently see (sometimes or often or or once in a great while, depending on the person) other "people" whoare not really people, but phantoms that walk away the moment they're spotted. This phenomenon is describedand analyzed, explanations are offered but ultimately it's left as a dark puzzle. And on the stories come: aretelling of "Rapunzel" in which she and the Prince have their misgivings about the whole affair, a riotouslyamusing new adventure for Paul Bunyan that's pure pleasure, a moving story spun-off from the Bible tale ofSamuel answering the voice of God and my favorite: a lovely, subtly impassioned, fanciful depiction of the soon-to-be Buddha as he awakens from pleasure to the possibilities of a contemplative life. Magic realism is a phrasecrafted for Millhauser; it's the phrase of choice for refined critics discussing great writing that involves thefantastical. But isn't all great writing magical? It certainly is here.SECRET WARRIORS  By Taylor Downing $28.95; PegasusTARGET TOKYO By James M. Scott $35; W.W. Norton & CompanyDid Oscar winner The Imitation Game give you a hankering for more tales of code breakers and war? Well diveinto Secret Warriors, the critically acclaimed work that charts the critical work done by spies and code breakersin World War I, a war not generally thought of as crucial for covert ops and cryptographers. But just as with WWII, their unsung brilliance was a key to victory.James M. Scott's potentially breakthrough work of popular history dives into a far better known event: thebombing raid on Tokyo led by Jimmy Doolittle that was retaliation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. In TargetTokyo, Scott tells this act of derring do in al its complexity, from the civilian casualties that enraged theJapanese to the revenge the Japanese took...on mainland China. Fellow historians like James Bradley haveraved and best-selling author Pat Conroy declared it's "one of the most incredible accounts of American militaryvalor I've ever read."</p>

So thetiming is perfect for the first full-scale biography of Tony, Grammy and Emmy-winning composer Cy Coleman.He did the music for everything from Sweet Charity to City Of Angels, not to mention collaborating on classicsongs like "The Best Is Yet To Come," "Witchcraft" and many more. Journalist Andy Propst covers Coleman'slife and speaks to seemingly everyone still alive that worked with the talented composer, including Tommy Tune,Chita Rivera, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, Bebe Neuwirth and many others. I went to the theater last night andthe man next to me was clutching a copy of it. it's that kind of buzzy book everyone in that world will want toread. (And knowing the show we watched, he probably wished he had stayed home to focus on the bookinstead.)THE WINTER FAMILY By Clifford Jackman $25.95; DoubledayOk, the TV show Justified just ended and you're already missing that Elmore Leonard-inspired modern daywestern. That show had a larky tone at times, but this is Western noir of the bloody sort. it's about a ruthlessgang of outlaws spawned by the Civil War and traces their cold-hearted adventures right up to their epic finalstand in the Oklahoma territories. Westerns are enjoying some of their most substantial works in years andJackman's book has earned pre-release acclaim from all the industry gate keepers like Publishers Weekly, aswell as the stamp of approval from Craig Johnson, the writer behind the Longmire series.CAPITAL DAMES By Cokie Roberts $27.99; HarperJournalist Cokie Roberts delivers her latest look at American history through the lens of its women. From the"Founding Mothers" she chronicled in an earlier bestseller, Roberts has moved forward to examine the crucialrole played by women in DC throughout the Civil War. She draws upon letters, diaries, gossipy coverage ofparties in the press and other often overlooked sources to shine a new light on those events. When history waswritten by men, women tended to be invisible or perhaps seen bravely waving a handkerchief as their husbandsand sons marched off to war. Roberts shows women politicking via parties and social calls, women spying forthe South, women crafting military strategy (and then fruitlessly demanding recognition for it), women sizing upthe political situation better than their husbands, women organizing medical care for soldiers despite stumblingblocks placed in their way by men who didn't think to do it themselves, women campaigning or using their solepolitical right to petition Congress as ways to push for an end to slavery and on and on. The siege of DC (whichwas virtually surrounded by hostile territory at the start of the war and filled with citizens who mostly hadsympathies for the south) is given a jolt thanks to the fresh perspective here. She also captures the doomedtrajectories of both First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the First Lady of the Confederacy Varina Davis, wife ofJefferson Davis. Mary had Southern roots and was viewed with suspicion by Northerners. Varina had Northernroots and was viewed with suspicion by Southerners. Both faced tragic losses, and both lost the former slaveand seamstress they treasured. Mary's side won the war but Varina won the peace. Mary had to fight to gain herfreedom from a mental asylum while Varina ultimately enjoyed a rich and satisfying post-war life. Mini-portraitsof countless other fascinating women abound in this diffuse but engaging work.Thanks for reading. Michael Giltz is the founder and CEO of BookFilter, a book lover's best friend.
