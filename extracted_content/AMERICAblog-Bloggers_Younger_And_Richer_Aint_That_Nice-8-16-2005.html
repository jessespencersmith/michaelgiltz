8/16/2005 11:26:00 PMA new Nielsen/NetRatings study on the blogs reported byMediaWeek says this:Nielsen//NetRatings found blog readership has grown 31percent since the beginning of the year, as blogs attracted29.3 million visitors in July. About one in five Internet usersvisit blogs, the research firm said. ComScore Media Metrix,another Internet research firm, last week released a studythat found blog readers are younger and more affluent thanother Internet users.Growing by 31%, some 30 million readers and as we know, liberalblogs are kicking the ass of rightwing blogs. Hey, they got cable newsand radio, at least we have the Internet.Most of the article is about RSS, which I don't use and don't reallyunderstand either. Any of you on it? As for being more affluent, tell itto my landlady -- she's still waiting for August's rent.
