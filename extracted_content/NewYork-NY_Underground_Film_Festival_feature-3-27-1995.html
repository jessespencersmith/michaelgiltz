            <p>Festiv,,1 New York, Underground 
THE CITY WILL BE 
LlnLE MORE DANGEROUS 
COME THIS MARCH. Controversy, and plenty of it, 
appears to be the M.O. for 
the New York Underground 
Film Festival, held March 22-26 at 
Anthology Film Archives (see "Muse­
ums, Societies, Etc."). Andrew Gur· 
land and Todd Phillips, a couple of 
smart·ass 24-year-old film·school 
grads, founded the festival last year. 
And for all the pair's antiestablish­
ment prattle, they've clearly taken 
some cues from the big leagues. 
Like Miramax, the Disney-owned 
iiberindependent that never met a 
fracas it couldn't milk for publicity, 
these boys live to provoke. Last year, they sparked attention by screening the 
NAMBlA documentary Chicken Hawk. And this year, the hot buttons recur: 
They've scheduled the festival to go head-to-head with Lincoln Center and MOo 
MA'S New DirectorslNew Films series. And they reportedly tangled with Miramax 
over the screening of Who Do You Think You're Fooling?, a short that claims 
Quentin Tarantino cribbed from an obscure Hong Kong film for sections of 
Reservoir Dogs. (Gultand and Phillips pulled it from a press screening at the 
last minute, saying it was overshadowing the other films in the series; Variety 
says Miramax strong-armed them into lying low; Miramax isn't talking.) In 
person, the guys are ragingly impolitic. They slag Slamdance, an alternative 
festival to Sundance, for trying to get aligned with its more established coun­
terpart. They mock the New York Film Festival's showcasing of Miramax's Bul­
lets Over Broadway and other movies already guaranteed wide 
exposure. "We don't want to be Richard Peiia's ugly stepsister," 
snorts Phillips, referring to one of that festival's organizers. 11'1 
fact, the two are so seH-consciously "alternative" that one 
would hate them entirely had they not put together an au­
thentically engaging lineup, including Mod Fuck Explosion 
and Memoirs of a Madman; shorts like The Straight 
Agenda (a parody of the right-wing video The Gay Agen­
da); and a tribute to the master of good bad taste, 
John Waters. After premiering in New York, the series 
goes on a 4O-city tour that-if things go according to plan-
will be dogged by controversy at every stop. MICHAD. Glm</p>
