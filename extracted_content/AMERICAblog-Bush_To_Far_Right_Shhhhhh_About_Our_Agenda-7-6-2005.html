7/06/2005 12:30:00 PMBush is urging the far right to tone down the heated rhetoricabout the opening on the Supreme Court. And stop mentioningall those hot button issues like abortion and equal rights forgays and government-sponsored religion.Why? Because Bush wants to play nice? No. Because Bushdoesn't agree with their agenda? Nope again. It's because Bushwholeheartedly agrees with their fringe, far right agenda andhe knows most Americans don't.Most Americans believe in a woman's right to choose. MostAmericans don't believe someone should be fired from theirjobs or be denied housing or kept away from their loved onesdying bedside simply because they're gay. Most Americans areuncomfortable with the government raising one particularreligion -- say, oh, I don't know, fundamentalist Christianity --high above all others. Most Americans want the government tostay out of their private lives and not take away their right tomake end-of-life decisions for themselves and their loved ones.Most Americans believe in reasonable gun control. And on andon.Bush doesn't. The far right doesn't. And they want to putsomeone on the Supreme Court who is WAY out of themainstream of judicial thought on all these issues. Someonelike Robert Bork, who recently said people imagined he wouldhave overturned Roe v. Wade. And you know what, he said?They were right.
