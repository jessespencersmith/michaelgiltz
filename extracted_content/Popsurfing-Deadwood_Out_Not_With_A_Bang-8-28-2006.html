            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  A U G U S T  2 8 ,  2 0 0 6"Deadwood" -- Out Not With A Bang.......but a whimper. In my book, last night was the series finale for"Deadwood." It had a terrific first season, a very good second season(that started slow but ended well) and a terrific third season with 11great episodes that absolutely flew by -- and a final episode thatsputtered to a halt. Gunmen were amassed for battle, violence hung inthe air, Powers Boothe was desperate for something to do, Trixie wasdesperate to die and it all just sort of...ended. It wasn't a bad episode,mind you. But clearly, the story isn't over and the feeling that this wasit probably overwhelmed the creators. Surely they sensed their dayswere numbered, even though the official word didn't leak out until afterthe episodes were filmed. But maybe HBO wasn't answering DavidMilch's phone calls as quickly. Just like the last few episodes of"American Dreams" and countless other great shows who heard theclock ticking, "Deadwood" failed to do justice in its final moments. Thatpair of two hour movies will probably be even worse, with forced arcsand a reaching for finality that really needed another two seasons.Don't let these hard words fool you into thinking the show failed tomeet expectations. Most every week it met and exceeded them. Then itgot shot in the back by the penny-pinching cowards known as networkexecutives. That's no way for a gunslinger to meet death.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
