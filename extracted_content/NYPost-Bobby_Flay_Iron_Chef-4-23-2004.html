            <p>Flay in the kitchen. Bobby vows to Flay the 'Iron Chef' 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
THE campy Japanese 
cooking show "Iron 
. Chef' returns to Amer­
ica for one-on-one battles 
between top U.S. names 
like Mario Batali of New 
York's Babbo and Wolf­
gang Puck and Japanese 
counterparts. 
Up first tonight at 9 p.m. 
on the Food Network: 
Bobby Flay takes on Hi­
royukiSakai. 
It won't be easy for Flay to win: Sakai has com­
peted in more than 80 
"Iron Chef" face-offs and 
he's never lost when_ the 
main dish is fish. The item 
'"S~kar and Flay' have to 
tackle? Trout. 
"The Japanese chefs take 
[the show] incredibly seri­
ously," says Flay. "They 
put their pride and reputa­
tion on the line." 
Certainly Flay's pride 
was wounded when he 
first competed on "Iron 
Chef" four years ago. "I cut my finger," admits 
the 39-year-old Flay. "I cut 
my finger. I had a tough 
time with the pressure." 
Not surprisingly, he lost. 
"I was a little pissed," 
Flay admits. "In this com­
petition, there's no substi­
tute for experience." 
That experience came in 
handy when Flay went to 
Japan for a rematch and 
won. 
Viewers who tune in to 
"Iron Chef" will see Flay 
serving a soup in an over-flowing coconut shell, a 
subtle nod to Japan. 
"I got the idea from the 
sake," says Flay. "They 
have the square, wooden 
cups and they always 
overflow them. I asked 
someone about it and they 
said it's about abundance." 
In the "Iron Chef" finale 
airing Sunday at 10 p.m., 
Flay and Masaharu Mori-. 
moto take on Hiroyuki 
Sakai and Batali. But Flay, 
despite "Iron Chef" and 
the shows he hosts for Food Network, still fo­
cuses on his restaurants. 
"I haven't opened a res­
taurant in 10 years," says 
Flay, who has a Mesa Grill 
opening this fall in Las 
Vegas as well as a new 
book, "Boy Gets Grill: 125 
Reasons to Light Your 
Fire," due out next month. 
"My restaurants [take up] 
90 percent of my time. 
The great thing about the 
Food Network is you 
shoot a little bit and they 
show them a lot."</p>
