Suiting up for a trip through the galaxy: Rachel Luttrell and Joe Flanigan. a 
o 
By MICHAEL GllTZ 
ON the new Sci Fi series "Slargate: 
Atlantis" - a spin-off from the qui­
etly successful "Stargate SGI," which 
just launched its eighth season -the lost 
city is finally rediscovered . But accord­
Ing 10 c<>-cr~3IOr Roh 'n ooper, it 
should have OCCUlTed lljles ago. 
"We plannell for this t happen a 
couple f years ngu." says oop 'r, 
who "Iso helps oversee "SGt." 
"But we were victims of our 
own success because the ratings 
for 'SGI' kept growing on Sci Fi. 
We originally planned the spin­
off to be more of a hand-off. 'SGI' 
would be finishing and then we 
would pass the baton to ''Atlantis.'' 
When they said they wanted both at 
the same time. it made us rethink the 
concept for the spin-off." 
Now, instead of one show ending and the 
other beginning, sci-fi fans get the best overload 
of entertainment since "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation" and "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" 
aired at the same time in the early '90s. It's the 
latest mark of success for "SCI," which was itsdf 
a spin·off from the modest 1994 theatrical hit 
starring James Spader and Kurt Russell. 
That led to the series debut on Show time 
starring Richard Dean Anderson as the leader 
of a team of explorers that travels through Star­
gates to other worlds. Five years on Showtime 
and in syndication led to its reloc~tion to Sci 
Fi. with the show always growing in popularity 
both overseas (where it's a smash hit and seen 
in more than 60 countries) and on DVD. 
The show's unique appeal? The Stargate sto­
ries don't take place in some distant future -
they involve people who live on earth here and 
now who must deal with alien cultures as best 
they can. Cooper knows that wish fulfillment 
-getting to interact with other worlds right 
now -is at the heart of "SC!." But he knew 
''Atlantis,'' especially since it would be airing at 
the same time as "SG\," had to be different. -I 5 
'Stargate' 
spin-off 
introduces 
new villains, 
the Wraiths 
That's why the team in this sbow is trapped 
in a different galaxy and living in the lost city 
of Atlantis. It's fm from a safe \1~ven thanks to 
its alien technology, the lack of fdrce fields that 
leave it vulnerabl e to the elements and the 
threat of new uber-villains, the:Wrruths. 
In conceiving the new show, ,Cooper doesn't 
hesitate to name the one element of "SGI" he 
was happiest to jettison. 
"The Coa'uld," he says firmly about "SCI's" 
main baddies, "I find them sort of ridiculou s. 
That's something I probably shQuldn't be say­
ing, considering I still executive produce the 
other show. 
"They're great for 'SGI' and they have a spe­
cific tone and feeling to them -these arro­
gant, theatrical, over-the-top, weird-dressing 
bad guys," Cooper says. "But for me it was a 
lot of fun to create the Wraiths -something 
fresh. They're a much more gothic, dark type 
of villain." 
The cast is populated with newcomers, 
including Joe Flanigan as the daring, rcbellious 
Maj. John Sheppard and Rachel Luttrell as Teyla, 
the hal, sexy leader of the Athosian race. 
Coopcr." lifelong fan of"The Six Million Dol­
lar Man," confesses he approached l.indsay 
Wagner about playing Dr. Elizabeth Weir, the 
head of the Stargate team, but ultimately decid­
ed the show didn't need a name to draw view­
ers (Torri Higginson got the part). 
Those fans shouldn't get too att3ched to 
"SCI," however. It looks like this could be the 
final season for that franchisc _ 
"We definitely think of the second half of 
this season as the series finale," Cooper 
admits. "There are economic s involved in 
moving forward to a season nine. and even to 
a season eight, quite frankly. But we'll see. I've 
learned never to say never. If 'SGI' docs even 
better than last year, it's entirely possible Sci 
Fi will do whatever they have to do to make 
[anothet season] happen."
