9/04/2005 06:11:00 PMDon't be surprised when confused stories come out and getcontradicted. Here's the latest, according to the AP and the TVfolk; the Army Corps of Engineers had contractors at work,they were shot at by some lunatics (obviously, there is nojustification for such lunacy) and the police shot and killed thepeople who were attacking them. Assuming these are the facts,bravo to the police for protecting emergency workers, bravo tothe people volunteering to go into these dangerous situationsand our thoughts are with the 99.99% of the Americans whocontinue to suffer, mostly due to incompetence by Bush duringthis national disaster. Remember: this chaos has erupted andcontinues because for the first three days of this disaster Bushand Cheney and Rice STAYED ON VACATION.
