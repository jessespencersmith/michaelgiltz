            <p>F R I D AY,  M A R C H  0 2 ,  2 0 0 7TV Quiz Show Scandal!!!!!I didn't tape "Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? but I will nextweek. Aaron aka watchboy aka richboy aka reality show junkie, insiststhat the kids must be getting the answers in advance. He says NONE ofthem have missed a SINGLE question yet, which certainly boggles themind. I don't think the kids are being fed answers (there's simply noadvantage to the show for the producers to risk doing that). But wehave to assume these kids are not "fifth graders" but GENIUS fifthgraders. That's fine, but that's also a very different show. "Are YouSmarter Than A Genius-Level 10 Year Old" should be the name of theshow and Ben Stein should be the host then instead of Jeff Foxworthy.How many teaspoons are in five tablespoons?What is the largest breed of bear?Who was the first President to be impeached?Okay, polar bear or grizzly bear. I actually guessed polar bear, but theyALL got it right. Are they taking home ec? If not, how the heck did theyALL know the measurements in a teaspoon versus a tablespoon. NotONE of them thought it might be two teaspoons per tablespoon insteadof three? And they ALL knew Andrew Johnson was the first Presidentto be impeached? Okay, I suggested to Aaron that maybe with Nixonand Reagan and Clinton (and Bush) that kids today learn a lot moreabout impeachment than they did back in the happier days of theSeventies and early Eighties. But still, they ALL knew it was Johnson.And Aaron says not one of them has missed a SINGLE question in anycategory. Let's keep an eye on this. Is it fishy or are these just thesmartest kids in the world? In either case, the premise of the show isdeeply misleading.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

I found it hard to believe thatany normal fifth grader would know the answer. I certainly did not,Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
