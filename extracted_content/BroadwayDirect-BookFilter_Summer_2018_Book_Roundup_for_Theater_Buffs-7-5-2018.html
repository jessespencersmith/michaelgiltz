MICHAEL GILTZ  | JULY 5, 2018
SHARE</p>
<p>By Henry Alford
$26, Simon & Schuster
Henry Alford is this generation’s Bill Plimpton, a writer who dives into a topic by actually diving
in. Here, Alford tells the story of dance while sharing his own story of using dance lessons toboost his confidence. Part popular history and part memoir, you get thumbnail sketches ofartists such as Twyla Tharp and George Balanchine along with the origins of everything from tapto ballroom to swing and even Zumba. (Alford wrote a hugely popular article for The New YorkTimes  about taking Zumba lessons, which led to this book.) By the time he’s dancing with
Alzheimer’s patients as part of their therapy, you’ll be laughing and tearing up at the same time.Read it before the heart-tugging film version does a tango with Oscar.

Beyond</p>
<p>By Frank “Fraver” Verlizzo

But most every image has a succinct paragraph about it, ranging from amusing storiesto insights on how it was created, or just Verlizzo’s enthusiastic excitement over working with,say, Mia Farrow or the show at hand. Before you know it, you’re knee-deep in stories andknowledge that will be a treat for fans and genuinely useful for professionals.

this acclaimed debut novel. Jana, Brit, Daniel, and Henry have nothing in common but theirpassionate devotion to classical music. But none of them has any other constant in their livesexcept their music, so they are linked for life. Oh, and there’s sex and friendship and betrayaland (sometimes) respect and hard-nosed business decisions and artistic gambles and triumphand tragedy. (It’s not all debates over the pacing of a movement!) Their ensemble, the Van NessQuartet, finds success, and so has author Aja Gabel by capturing the risks and rewards of a lifein the arts. Whatever the fate of their ensemble, Gabel is clearly off to an excellent start.</p>

Outside the Jukebox</p>
<p>By Scott Bradlee
$23, Hachette Books
Postmodern Jukebox is the genius brainchild of Scott Bradlee, a struggling jazz musician in New
York City who stumbled onto viral video success by doing “period” covers of current hits. Theband performed songs by Nickelback done in the style of Motown, and doo-wop, ragtime, andswing versions of other songs soon followed — all recorded in Bradlee’s basement apartment inQueens. But a cover of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’s “Thrift Shop” exploded in popularity, andbefore he knew it, Bradlee’s goofy idea led to appearances on Good Morning, America, albums,massive YouTube success, and eventually world tours. He’s featured a slew of American Idolalums, Broadway vets including Shoshana Bean, and more musicians than you can shake abaton at. It works because they’re not making fun of the songs they cover. PMJ is demonstratingthat Meghan Trainor’s “All About That Bass” isn’t just a catchy single, it’s a solid song. NowBradlee has delivered this DIY manifesto/memoir with Outside the Jukebox,  a book that
chronicles his unlikely journey and details the stumbles and successes along the way with thesame enthusiastic charm that has made his high-concept band such a triumph.
