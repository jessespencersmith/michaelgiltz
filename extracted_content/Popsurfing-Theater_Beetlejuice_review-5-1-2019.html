THEATER: "BEETLEJUICE" SHOWS A LITTLE
LIFE
BEETLEJUICE  ** out of ****
WINTER  GARDEN  THEATRE  
The new show Beetlejuice  just scored eight Tony nominations,
including Best Musical. But its best bet to win a statue is surely in Best
Scenic Design. Nominee David Korins gets to play in the world createdby the film's director Tim Burton and he  in turn was inspired by
Edward Gorey, old horror films and a thousand other sources. Korins
has a blast in this show, creating a nicely askew old home and then
layering on look after look for the main set right in front of our eyes.Combine that with ghouls, a giant snake (I mean, a GIANT snake),wacky costumes by William Ivey Long (also nominated) and great
lighting by Kenneth Posner and Peter Nigrini (both also nominated)
and sound by Peter Hylenski (ditto, or is that thritto?) and you've gota fun show with a pop-up haunted house aesthetic that fans of TimBurton will enjoy. Toss in Alex Brightman's tireless cheerleading asthe title ghoul (essentially delivering the same Red Bull of a
performance he delivered in School  Of  Rock  even though it's supposed
to be subversive rather than inspiring) and you've got a show that's not
bad, a backhanded compliment but a sincere one.
Turning the movie Beetlejuice  into a musical made more sense than,
say, Pretty  Woman  for the simple fact that everyone who saw it
remembers the big musical number and funniest moment in the film.
That's the scene where people at a dinner party are unwittingly forcedby a demon to lip sync to Harry Belafonte's "Day-O (The Banana BoatSong)." On stage, the actors actually sing the song, though I think it
would have been funnier to have them lip sync, just like in the film. It's
still the highlight of the stage show, just like in the movie. And there'sthe problem. All the fun bits of Beetlejuice  (just like most of the fun
bits in Tootsie ) feel like call backs to what was done better and first onMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>film. Worse, unlike Tootsie  the movie  Beetlejuice  is a modest comedy
at best, so there's not much to mine in the first place.  
The show's creators knew that. The film is a collection of gags sort of
held together by Michael Keaton's manic turn and the achingseriousness of Winona Ryder (which makes her intentionally all the
funnier). There's almost no plot worth mentioning or caring about. So
the show must engineer one.  
Our teen goth heroine (a solid Sophia Anne Caruso) isn't just a kidwho LOVES to embrace the weird. Instead of  choosing  to be goth, she
is burdened by the death of her mom, which is a lot less fun. Her dadadds to the pain by refusing to mention his dead wife's name. It takesa haunted house, two very dull ghosts, the sexy beast Beetlejuice, afake guru, that giant snake and a trip to the underworld (or the Nether
Region or whatever they call it) just to get dad to admit he misses his
wife too. It's a big journey for a very small and obvious payoff.  
Ultimately, the show collapses under our lack of interest in the blandghosts (poor Kerry Butler and Rob McClure, doing their best), theforgettable songs and the heartfelt confessions of a girl and her dad we
could see coming a mile off.  
Beetlejuice  is a lot more fun when it just goes nuts, from the crazy
costumes to the chorus of ghouls to Brightman getting all sexually fluid
with every character in sight. The first act really is pretty good, almost,
thanks to Brightman, a lot of sight gags and Leslie Kritzer doing a
great turn as the ditzy Delia   (played in the film by Catherine O'Hara).
Really, it was Tony-worthy but fell through the cracks in a strong yearfor supporting women.  
We barely cared about the characters in act one. When act two keepsintroducing more of them to less and less interest (a bland fakeguru/exorcist; an underworld bureaucrat, etc.) along with thatthoroughly unnecessary heartwarming revelation, the show's energyflags entirely.

<p>and cheers can't mask that fact.) Thankfully, they reprise "Day-O" at
the curtain call. How could they not? But I still say they should have
lip-synced it.
