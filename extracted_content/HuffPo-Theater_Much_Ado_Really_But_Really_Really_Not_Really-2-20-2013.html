Really?'  Not  Really.
MUCH  ADO  ABOUT  NOTHING  *** out of ****
REALLY  REALLY  * out of ****
MUCH  ADO  ABOUT  NOTHING  *** out of ****
THE  DUKE  ON  42ND  ST.
One of Shakespeare's most performed and yet most frustrating plays, Much  Ado  About
Nothing  features young lovers you don't really want to see get together. But if you've got a
battling Beatrice and Benedick, the night is sure to be rescued. That's certainly the casewith this new production by Theatre For A New Audience and director Arin Arbus, a teamresponsible for some of the best Shakespeare in recent years.
Maggie Siff and Jonathan Cake are the two wits who are the last to realize they are fated
for each other. The play is set in Sicily before World War I to no particular effect. Buttheir barrage of insults and put-downs is as devastating as trench warfare and just asfruitless: neither one gains any ground on the other until their friends whisper in theirears that it is true love masked by the poison gas of their disdain.
Siff begins a little sourly, perhaps, but after the laying of the trap (in which she is hidden
in bushes and turns a sound of astonishment into the cooing of a bird), Beatrice is ready
to be won. We're already won over by Cake's Benedick. He's an actor with exceptional
appeal, combining a romantic's heart with a Nathan Fillion-like ability to not take himself
too seriously. Their inevitable coming together is wholly satisfying.
Arbus has taken to heart Trevor Nunn's admonition that he's never seen this play donewith sufficient seriousness. (Though one wonders what was stopping him from doing sohimself.) She has a gift for simple, elegant choreography in her staging that keeps us
focused on the characters and the text. Her Much  Ado  is set at twilight, not for the sake of

<p>romance but rather for the gloomier prospect of the end of the day (and perhaps the
dawning of war). This keeps the dark heart of the play from being such a shock. Claudio
(Matthew Amendt) falls instantly in love with the lovely Hero (Michelle Beck) and just as
instantly is tricked into believing she is a trollop. He denounces her at their wedding and
she swoons. The world is told that Hero is dead and Beatrice demands that Benedickprove his declared love for her by killing Claudio. Frothy fun it's not.
The main stumbling block to enjoying Much  Ado  -- and one not quite surmounted here --
is that you don't much want Claudio to get Hero back. He certainly doesn't deserve her.
Amendt does not figure out a way to play Claudio's foolish anger to make us empathize
with him. And Hero's decision to marry him anyway leaves us cold, despite Beck's appeal
in a thankless role. Shakespeare missed an opportunity towards the end when Claudio
believes he is marrying another woman in Hero's place. He should have declared his
unworthiness more fully, explained to this veiled woman how unworthy he was of Hero,
how he should have doubted his eyes before he doubted her heart. Alas, Shakespeare is
not around to take my notes.
On the positive side, the essentially serious tenor of the evening allows the real pain that
Claudio causes to be given its due weight. Saxon Palmer finds a strong, straightforwardmalice to animate the scheming Don John, the bastard who manipulates Claudio intobelieving he has been cuckolded. This dark matter also, oddly, allows the humor of theplay to come across more naturally and not as the odd interruption it can sometimes be.
As the bumbling Dogberry, John Christopher Jones avoids playing to the crowd and milks
more laughs because of it. His assistant Verges is captured to hilariously serious effect byJohn Keating, who has the hair and crazed demeanor of a young Christopher Lloyd here,watching Dogberry with admiring intensity and echoing his every word in a way thatmakes sense of this hanger-on. With admirable versatility, Keating also plays the seriousFather Francis, a character who has some hellaciously long and expository speeches hedelivers with ease.
But it's Beatrice and Benedick who remain in our memory thanks to two performers who
charm right to the very end. In an amusing bit of business, they are the last to leave thestage, with Beatrice wanting to go one way and Benedick the other. They pantomimebickering until he finally pulls her off to one side... and then a moment later she crossesback the other way and he follows helplessly behind.
REALLY  REALLY  * out of ****
LUCILLE  LORTEL  THEATRE
One struggles to understand what drew director David Cromer to this over-stuffed, under-
baked nonsense of a play that desperately pushes buttons in hopes of creating somedrama. His recent triumphs include Tribes  and Our  Town , but this drama by Paul Downs
Colaizzo offers nothing for Cromer to work with.
Similarly, Zosia Mamet has shown great taste in landing parts in movies like The  Kids  Are
Alright  and memorable roles on TV shows like Mad  Men  and Girls . Perhaps the lure of
her first leading role convinced her to tackle the character Leigh in a show that wouldinevitably be compared to David Mamet's Oleanna  and found wanting.
It begins in a tiresome display of testosterone as three college dudes recover from a wildparty the night before. Cooper is played by David Hull, who is rarely allowed to keep hisshirt on and has the muscle-bound physique to both make that pleasant and convince asan athlete. Coop is the most aggressively frat boy-ish of the guys, though video gamefanatic Johnson (Kobi Libii) isn't far behind. They're both just pleased that their friendDavis (Matt Lauria) finally broke his dry spell and scored the previous night with Leigh(Zosia Mamet). The fact that it's with a girl who is in a serious relationship with theirfriend Jimmy (Evan Jonigkeit) is a minor inconvenience but nothing more.
But we know something worse than infidelity is afoot because in the opener Leigh
stumbled home in a drunken stupor with her roommate Grace (Lauren Culpepper). They</p>
<p>laughed and giggled and knocked things over but when Grace went to bed, Leigh curled
up on the couch in pain.
Soon, Leigh is accusing Davis, a guy so sweet and kind he's nicknamed "Good Davis," of
rape. Davis doesn't know what to say -- he was so drunk he literally doesn't remember
what happened the night before but the idea of raping someone astonishes him. Being
Good Davis, he also doesn't want to offend by insisting that something he can't remember
doing might not have happened at all. Heck, he doesn't even remember kissing Leigh.
It's no surprise to find out that this accusation is soon colored by confusing information.
Colaizzo's story offers up so many twists and turns we soon lose interest. The following
paragraph includes some spoilers, though since we're never quite sure what might be true
or not, it doesn't seem cheating to cover some of them.
Leigh may be faking a pregnancy with her boyfriend Jimmy and the rape story might be a
useful way to explain a "miscarriage." Or Leigh may actually have been pregnant andcheated on Jimmy and now she's had a real miscarriage and claiming rape seems the
easiest way out. Or Leigh may be getting revenge on all women since Good Davis
apparently wasn't so good and when drunk he perhaps hit his last girlfriend and that's
why she left him but Leigh thinks he needs to suffer more. Or Leigh may be jealousbecause she's always had a crush on Davis but he would never date her so accusing him ofrape is sweet revenge. Or Leigh may simply be unhinged since she and her sister Haley(Aleque Reid) were brutalized by their father and have the horrific scars on their backs toprove it.
This dizzying array of possibilities is more about the confusion of the play than the
complexity of Leigh, who devolves into an emasculating nightmare Coop and Johnson andDavis couldn't have dreamt up in their most dude-ish dreams. When a play is a mess, it'sno surprise that the confusion extends to the tech elements, notably the scenic design byDavid Corins. It's dominated by a couch and an archway that is moved this way and thatto indicate the entrance to apartments and homes but mainly seems to just be in the way.
Literally no one in Really  Really  is sympathetic, which is hardly a problem. Plenty of plays
and movies and TV shows involve unpleasant and even villainous people. But no one is
compelling or interesting in the least either. Cooper panics and wants to protect his jockstatus, where he doesn't have to really take classes or graduate but just play and drink andeventually accept the cushy job waiting for him from his dad. Johnson is given a bizarrespeech in which he explains what a good friend and person he is while insisting he mustkeep his distance from Davis because Johnson has spent his whole life barely breathingwhile he struggles to maintain his reputation. (Though if he's desperate not to be sulliedby association with an accused rapist, why the heck does he come over to play more videogames?) Jimmy is Leigh's unconvincingly born-again Christian boyfriend who blithely
insists she must dump her best friend once they get married.
Said best friend has a wildly uninteresting side plot where she is hosting a semi-annual
meeting of a club devoted to future leaders of America. Grace must improvise her big
speech when she loses it and talks on and on about the economy and the world we live in
and shrinking opportunities and so on, none of it germane or amusing or insightful. It's a
credit to Culpepper that she keeps this section from going completely off the rails. But
nothing can make sense of her outburst against Leigh. Grace believes Leigh has fabricatedthe rape charge and they have a falling out. Storming off, Grace says that if Leigh was infact raped, she hopes it hurt. Huh? Imagine trying to discern your motivation for thatlittle zinger.
Lauria (very good on Friday  Night  Lights ) has it even worse as Davis, a passive befuddled
character who is asked to make several utterly unconvincing moves late in the play that
are thoroughly unbelievable and then simply unjustified given the little we know abouthim. The actors do their best and it's mainly to their credit that we don't burst outlaughing after the fourth or fifth soap-like revelation, from Leigh's sister bizarrely pullingdown her jeans so she can wipe her ass on Leigh's couch in disdain when no one islooking to the wildly improbable twists at the end.</p>
<p>Anyone can do anything, of course, and characters can surprise us. But we have to believe
in them before they can do that. Colaizzo hasn't done a thing but traffic in broadbrushstrokes. Davis can't surprise us since we never for a moment believe Davis or Leighor any of these characters really exist. Really.
