 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdOperation Backpack Sends Hope To
NYC Homeless Kids
The annual Operation Backpack NYC  campaign led by
Volunteers of America and its spokesperson Paige Davis
is in full swing now through July 24 in New York City.The facts are simple: New York City has an estimated11,000 school-age children who are homeless right now.They'll be headed to school in September without thesupplies they need to succeed. In fact, not having thebasics like a backpack and the tools that come with it
can be so shameful they don't want to go to school at all.
Operation Backpack  works now to buy new backpacks
and fill them with age-appropriate supplies  (hand
sanitizer and washable markers for little kids, athesaurus and calculator for high school students and so
on) and gets them into the hands of the kids who desperately need them in time for the start of school inSeptember. If you're in NYC, you can drop off supplies or new backpacks  at any Duane Reade throughout
the five boroughs and beyond ( check here for a full listing of drop-off sites ). And anyone can donate
anything they can afford right here . VoA estimate it costs $35 to provide a new backpack, supplies and
the knowledge that somebody cares to a 4th grader.
Here's an email chat I had with spokperson Paige Davis  about the campaign, which has sprouted up
around the country. An actress, author and TV personality as host of Trading Spaces,  Davis has been
involved with this campaign for years.
What's the goal for Operation Backpack 2011?Paige Davis: Last year Operation Backpack distributed more than 7,000 filled backpacks with grade-
specific supplies to children in need. But each year we exceed our previous mark. This year our goal is todistribute at least 9,000, and we need all the help we can get.
Why backpacks? I assume it's because at-risk kids may not have a permanent address but
can always take a backpack with them anywhere.
Paige Davis: Feeling different, or even ashamed, can be one of the greatest deterrents to a homeless child
going to school. Operation Backpack strives to help children from homeless shelters look and feel liketheir housed classmates. Most kids have backpacks these days, and picking out a backpack at the
beginning of the school year has become a rite of passage. Also, Volunteers Of America doesn't just drop
school supplies in random boxes or bundles at the shelters. We get lists from each shelter of how manyboys and girls in each grade [are staying there]. Each and every backpack becomes its own gift bag withALL the grade-specific school supplies for each individual child. Kids from grades Pre-K thru 12th gradeare supplied with everything from watercolors and crayons for the younger grades, to calculators anddictionaries for the older kids.
You must have seen these backpacks -- or just the fact that people are reaching out -- make
an impact in so many lives. What's the most moving part of the campaign for you?
Paige Davis: I like that we get the public involved. Operation Backpack serves as much as a public
awareness campaign as it does a collection drive. With official drop locations at every Duane Reade store,any person can contribute. And I simply love how tangible all of it is. Giving money to a charity can be

<p>easy (and believe me, we will take the money!- www.OperationBackpackNYC.org ). But it's so rewarding
to pick out packs and supplies, and be involved in the actual packing and sorting of the backpacks.
There's something very moving about knowing that each and every backpack that passes through myhands will end up directly in the hands of a child who needs it.
Work like this is an example of celebrities giving back, but I'm certain you feel you get
more out of it than you ever put in. Tell me what being involved with Operation Backpackmeans to you.
Paige Davis: Sometimes, receiving a backpack from VOA is the first time a child feels anyone believes in
them, and their ability to go to school and succeed. Seeing the looks on the children's faces when theyreceive their school supplies is priceless and beyond words. You don't see many smiles in a homelessshelter, so to see a young girl or boy thrilled with their new crayons or folders or glue is so fulfilling. Thatsmile represents something these children rarely feel -- hope.
