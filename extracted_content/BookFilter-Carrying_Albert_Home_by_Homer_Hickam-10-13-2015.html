Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayIf I had a bookstore, I'm not sure where I'd stock this new book by Homer Hickam, the author of a string of memoirsand novels, namely "Rocket Boys" aka "October Sky" about his childhood in coal mining country. It's called "CarryingAlbert Home" and since it's a sort-of true memoir about a road trip his parents took with their pet alligator down toOrlando Florida during the Great Depression, at first why the Biography section makes sense. Then you keepreading and the stories get wilder and more improbable -- bootleggers, smugglers, bank robbers, union radicals,making a Hollywood movie, a hurricane and both John Steinbeck AND Ernest Hemingway -- make appearances --and well, maybe fiction makes more sense. By the end, after the ghosts and the wild mountain man spouting poetrywith his salacious Muslim wife and that dancing fool actor Buddy Ebsen, I'd be looking for the Tall Tales section. Inthe end, I'd just stock it up front by the door, so everyone can see the great cover, recognize the name Hickam,glance at a summary, and maybe open a page or two and find themselves sucked in and bingo, you've got anothersale. Sweet, funny, and somehow clear-eyed but romantic at the end. And sort-of true. -- MIchael GIltzLessWhat Others Say“Great memoirs must balance the universal and the particular...In his debut, Hickam...walks the line beautifully...Nomatter how jaded readers have become by the onslaught of memoirs, none will want to miss the fantastic voyage ofBCMA, Auk and Coalwood.” - Publishers Weekly on Rocket Boys“Recalling a lost era, the transition between small-town life and the dawning of the new technological age, he bringshis American hometown to life with vivid images, appealing characters and considerable literary magic.” - PublishersWeekly on The Coalwood WayWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
