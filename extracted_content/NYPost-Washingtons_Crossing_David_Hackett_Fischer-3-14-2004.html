How Washington really won the \Nar 
By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
Historical nonfiction books 
often face the unfortunate 
fate of being, well, deadly 
boring. 
Not historian David Hackett 
Fischer's new one. 
In "Washington's Crossing" 
(Oxford University Press, $35), 
Hackett tackles one of the signal 
events of the American Revolu­
tion -the night a bedraggled 
group of rebels led by George Washington crossed the Dela­
Ware River and launched a sur­
prise attack -and brings it to 
such vivid life, you'll be worried 
about whether they'll succeed. 
Every school kid knows that 
iconic painting by Emanuel 
Leutze titled "Washington 
Crossing The Delaware," and 
most people with a passing ac­
quaintance with American his­
tor~ think they know the story 
bchmd It: how the Hessians (i.e. 
the paid German soldiers) got 
it's American history 
convincin gly declares that the 
Hessians were not drunk. They 
were simply worn out with ex­
haustion over false alarms and 
sneak attacks. 
He also shows that the tide 
was already turning in the reb­
els' favor, thanks to Thomas 
Paine's rousing "American Cri­
sis" pamphlet, spontaneous up­
risings among tbe peoples of 
New Jersey, regular raids that 
kept the Hessians jumpy, and 
the vicious behavior of the Brit­
ish <lnd Hessian soldiers. 
And vvhile W~lshingto n may not have stood quite so tall in 
that boat, anyone actually sitting 
down on that stormy night 
would have been sitting in a 
pool of icy cold water. 
The details are fascinating. 
Even Fischer's description of the 
different groups that made up 
the revolutionary army is telling. 
Backwoodsmen showed up with 
uniforms featuring the slogan 
"Don't Tread On Me," reflecting 
their individualistic streak. 
V.iashington himself came from 
the stratified world of Virginia, 
'Nhere ail men were "[we" --hilt those without land and property 
knew their place. 
The troops from Massachu­
setts were integrated with Indi­
ans and Africans alongside 
whites, reflecting the life on 
ships where many of them 
worked. And the Philadelphia 
Associators were the most egali­
tarian fighting unit imaginable. 
Ambitious, carefully re;;soned 
and great fun, "Washington' s 
Crossing" refuses to gl2.morize 
that iconic moment in .A.mt'rican 
history -and make!< it 'lll. the 
more remarbble in th tclling.</p>
