4/30/2005 11:15:00 AMA blog of disgruntled employees at Los Alamos is focusingattention on the turmoil and anger created by the currentdirector G. Peter Nanos. The New York Times reports:Four months of jeers, denunciations and defenses ofDr. Nanos's management recently culminated indozens of signed and anonymous messagesconcluding that his days were numbered. The postingsto a public Web log conveyed a mood ofself-congratulation tempered with sober discussions ofwhat comes next....Dr. Nanos would not comment. A spokesman for LosAlamos, Kevin Roark, said false rumors of the director'sresignation had circulated for months....Several outside experts said that the director's quickdeparture was inevitable and that the blog's attackswere playing a significant role."Nanos is leaving," said Greg Mello, director of the LosAlamos Study Group, a private organization inAlbuquerque that monitors weapons laboratories. "Theblog changed the climate, giving people an outlet theydidn't have before."Blogs seem to be everywhere. But this one is unusual,in that the Los Alamos National Laboratory, isolated inthe mountains of New Mexico, has a long history ofmaintaining the highest level of federal secrecy. Thelab's very existence was once classified. Today, barbedwire rings many of its buildings, federal agentsmonitor its communications, and its employees areconstantly reminded that loose lips sink ships.The blog (lanl-the-real-story.blogspot.com) wentpublic in January and since then has registered morethan 100,000 visits, with more than half a millionpages viewed and more than 5,000 comments, someextensive. Discussions run on a variety of topics, fromthe sanctity of retirement benefits to the likely identityof the next contractor who will run Los Alamos.One more reason for business and government to take blogsvery seriously indeed -- and for people who contribute to blogswith postings and comments to be cognizant of the impact wecan have. With great power comes great responsibility, as PeterParker was once told.
