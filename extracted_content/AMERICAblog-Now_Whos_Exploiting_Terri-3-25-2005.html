3/25/2005 10:26:00 PMExploiting the pain of Terri Schiavo's family (which INCLUDESher husband and parents) has begun. The Traditional ValuesCoalition -- which spends most of its time attacking the basiccivil rights of gays -- is piggybacking on the media firestormwith posts on its website saying "Help Save Terri Schiavo'sLife!" How? By donating money to TVC, of course. (Help saveher life by making sure the loved ones of gay people are deniedentry to their death beds? Huh?)The Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability -- accordingto the New York Times -- says exploiting causes peripheral toyour work is a no-no. Accusations that cannot be proved --such as the lies many websites have spread that MichaelSchiavo shoved Terri down a flight of stairs, etc. -- would"stretch" the org's requirement that you be truthful. Yeah, italso stretches one of those commandments.Wanna have some fun? Go to those religious-right websites,find some examples of their breaking these rules, and file acomplaint at www.ecfa.org. Go for it!
