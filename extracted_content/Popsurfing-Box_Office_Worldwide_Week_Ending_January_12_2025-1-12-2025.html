Bold: movies that have or likely will triple their reported
budgets. That's my standard for a movie being a box office hit
from theatrical alone. Many films will be profitable for a
studio even if they don't triple their reported budget, but it's
a good marker to indicate a big hit. 
ANALYSIS 
Boy, is it January! I went to see A Complete Unknown at my local
multiplex on Sunday afternoon and the parking lot was practically
empty. After a huge run from Thanksgiving to New Year's and lots of
different movies doing well, everyone needed a break, apparently. The
massive winter storm didn't help either. Oscar hopefuls like The
Brutalist and Nickel Boys are expanding nicely while A Complete
Unknown  holds well. Meanwhile, Nicole Kidman proves her star power
as Babygirl passes $30m worldwide. (He makes her drink milk! I just
wish he'd made her wear that AMC promo spangly pant suit.) 
Wicked foolishly went to Premium Video on Demand, even though the
blockbuster film could expect two more months of attention from
Oscar nominations and sing-along screenings and needs to raise its
profile in other countries. (Unlike most big Hollywood spectacles, it
made most of its money in North America. But a sequel comes in
November and they should position it to do even better overseas.)
Nonetheless, the film went to PVOD and Universal proudly announced
it grossed $70m right off the bat. They're thrilled of course: the studio
gets roughly 80% of PVOD grosses but only 50-60% or so from boxTHE ULTIMATE GRAMMY

<p>office. So the movie needed to make say $110m or so for them to make
the same amount of money. And maybe if they'd waited, the PVOD take
would have been substantially less. Sure, but everytime they rush a hit
film onto PVOD,  they're undercutting theatrical, releasing a pristine
bootleg into the world and arguably making a film less
special.  Wicked is substantially more fun in theaters than sitting at
home alone. It's a huge film. And it's got part two coming out later this
year. The cash grab "worked" but at what expense. And how
disappointing for the exhibitors Universal depends on 365 days a year,
for upcoming films like  Wolf Man, Dog Man, Bridget Jones: Mad
About The Boy, the live action  How To Train Your Dragon, Jurassic
World: Rebirth, Downton Abbey 3 and  Wicked: For Good in
November. The shorter the window for  hit films, the shorter the days
they can expect exhibitors to support  them and the shorter the time
before theatrical dies entirely. 
We've got more data from 2024, the year when wide releases in North
America were down 25% from what Hollywood turned out in the peak
years pre-COVID. Naturally, one would expect box office to be down
25% but we did better than that. Ticket sales? That's another story,
with some 740m being sold and that's a slight underperformance. (It's
down 26% from the roughly 1 billion sold from 2016-2019. One billion,
minimum. ) 
Now pretending we know admissions is a joke. For North America, the
MPA takes the box office gross and divides it by the average ticket price
to get a very rough estimate of ticket sales. You've got matinees and kid
price tickets and people who use monthly passes but they just pretend
they can track admissions. Still, since they've always done this it's a fair
measure to compare against itself. It's not good to see box office
stronger but ticket sales slowing. That means more people are paying
more money for fancy tickets like IMAX and such. You want movie-
going to be a regular event for people, not a special big night two or
three times a year. But again, no chain wants to release a breakdown of
actual admissions and I've no clue how those passes (like my AMC A-
List!) factor into this. So I'll take this one metric with a big grain of salt
and yet still wish it were showing admissions back where they were
seven years ago. Maybe 2025! 
I did see a lot of trailers on my Dylan outing and from 28 Years Later
to Rami Malek as The Amateur to Anthony Mackie as Captain
America: Brave New World to Love Hurts with Ke Huy Quan making
like Jackie Chan in an action comedy, it looks like some big movies will
be popping up regularly. I've got my eye on Dog Man, which I think
will handily outperform expectations. 
And how was A Complete Unknown? As a Dylan fan (not fanatic, but
huge fan) I should have found it ridiculous but didn't. The acting (and
singing!) were generally very strong. Edward Norton is very good in
what might have been a jokey or tiresome role. It sort of fell apart for
me towards the end when Dylan became more "Dylan" but all in all a
fine movie, with some very strong musical moments. It became a little
too broad brushstroke by the end to get across the ideas they wanted,
but still. It might easily have been laughable and really, it wasn't. A3/24/25, 3:03 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  12, 2025

<p>lovely image at the end says it all about Dylan and Pete Seeger. Dylan is
riding away alone on his motorcycle (too fast, I might add!). He's
leaving the 1965 Newport Folk Festival he just upended by going
electric. Dylan pauses for a moment near the stage area and sees Pete
Seeger, ever the folkie and man of peace, helping to collect the folding
chairs and stow them on a truck. Of  course Pete Seeger is helping clean
things up! 
NOTE: I still don't have good final box office info on two of the biggest
hits of 2024: India's apparent all-time India and worldwide smash
Pushpa 2: The Rule and Hong Kong's all-time local smash The Last
Dance. 
NOTES 
mb = a film's budget in millions of US dollars; ww = worldwide
1. Mufasa: The Lion King– $200mb 
2. Sonic The Hedgehog 3– $120mb
3. Nosferatu– $50mb for Robert Eggers, acclaimed director of The
Witch, The Lighthouse and The Northman. That had his biggest budget
and was not a commercial success. I saw him as more of an arthouse
guy. But backers stuck with him, gave him a big budget and a starry
cast for a remake of  Nosferatu, which I guess is classier than
remaking  Dracula but still a hard sell I thought. And on Christmas
Day? That's counter-programming I was not behind. Happily, I was
wrong and Eggers looks more like the next Peter Jackson/Guillermo
Del Toro than a guy given big budgets too fast or for the wrong
projects. Good for him! 
4. Game Changer–$45mb for Indian-Telugu political action film w new
politico uncovering corruption and kicking ass.
5. Moana 2– Is the budget lower since it was intended for tv, at first?
Or higher because they had to rethink everything? Disney says it cost
$150mb, just like the original. You can bet Dwayne Johnson gets more
than his share of coconuts, but that won't matter with a hit like this.  
6. Octopus With Broken Arms aka Wu Sha 3 (Manslaughter 3)–
Chinese drama about businessman's daughter kidnapped from his
home. 
7. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera–$40mb for Gerard Butler action flick. 
8. Wicked– $150mb for each part, so $300mb total plus beaucoup
marketing. It's a big movie! 
9. Big World– $29m ww debut. Chinese drama starring pop star and
actor Jackson Yee as a young man living with cerebral palsy. Yee has
gone from boyband TFBoys to having the Mandarin song of the year in
2017 to success in TV and film. How's his English, asks Hollywood? 3/24/25, 3:03 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  12, 2025
https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/01/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending_12.html 4/7</p>
<p>10. Babygirl–$20mb for this Nicole Kidman sexy drama about a
powerful businesswoman finding her kink with a younger, dominating
man..her intern, no less! No milk was harmed in the making of this
movie. 
11. Honey Money Phony–Chinese rom-com about young woman
suddenly burdened with debt who falls for a (very handsome) young
con man. Will he go straight for her or teach her his wicked ways so she
can get out from under this financial disaster? 
12. Finist. The First Warrior–a Russian fantasy film starring actor Kirill
Zaytsev as "the strongest, most agile, and handsome hero of
Belogorye," according to Wikipedia. Zaytsev certainly fits the bill,
though since Belogorye currently has fewer than 3000 people, that may
not be such a major claim. Russians are surely starved for homegrown
cinema; it's been a while since Russian films made the charts. But I
couldn't even find a trailer for it on YouTube. 
13. A Complete Unknown–$60mb+ for this Bob Dylan biopic? That's a
lot of money for a film about Dylan going electric at Newport. I mean, I
want to see it but then I'm a Dylan fanatic. Off to a very good start and
star Timotheé Chalamet is sure to get an Oscar nomination, so it
should keep going. But $180m worldwide seems highly unlikely to me,
if not impossible. (Do other countries give a toss about this? Is
Chalamet a big enough draw for this story? I doubt it.) I'm glad it was
made, but it was made for too much. Like  Gladiator II, this will be seen
as a commercial success, but it's not. 
14. Conclave– a reported $20mb for this Vatican thriller means this is
a hit. It's at $60m and still going strong, with a boost from potential
Oscar noms. I do  not see the point in putting it on PVOD and flooding
the market with bootlegs while potentially harming box office. This is
exactly the sort of film that can play and play in theaters.  
15. Gladiator II–$250mb for Ridley Scott sword and sandals epic. It
needs $750m worldwide for me to call it a hit from theatrical alone but
$600m would be just fine. It's got swords. It's got sandals. Does it have
legs? No, it does not. This is the sort of film that everyone thinks of as a
hit, but actually didn't deliver. The talk of  Gladiator 3 is nonsense.
Maybe many years from now they'll use the name to launch a new
franchise, but this is the end for now. 
16. Paddington in Peru–$50mb? I'm just guessing. (That's sort of
midpoint between the original and  Paddington 2.) Sadly, three times is
not the charm artistically for this once-perfect franchise.
17. Harbin–A South Korean historical drama set in the early 1900s
about rebels fighting against the Japanese occupation of Korea. When
one rebel leader shows mercy to Japanese prisoners and his men pay
the price, he vows to redeem himself by assassinating the first Prime
Minister of Japan. So this one will probably  not have a good run in
Japan. 
18. Detective Conan: Crossroad in the Ancient Capitol  (2003)–
China reissue of Japanese animated franchise entry. Film had $32m3/24/25, 3:03 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  12, 2025
https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/01/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending_12.html 5/7</p>
<p>before reissue in China. I mean, they keep making them so
I assume they're profitable. 
19. The Prosecutor–Chinese drama starring Donnie Yen, who uncovers
a deep conspiracy when a poor young man is framed for drug
trafficking. Not on Donnie's watch!
20. The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim–per Screendollar, the
budget is $30mb for this animated prequel to  The Hobbit and  The Lord
of the Rings movies. Even at that price, it's a flop.  Taken solely from
minor footnotes in the novels, it was a gamble but a smart one. An
animated film won't be compared to Peter Jackson's masterpiece. (See:
the TV series.) And it's not retelling stories we've already heard. (See:
superhero movies that go back to the well by redoing an origin story for
Superman, Spiderman, et al.) Unfortunately, you still have to be good.
The trailer I saw disappointed and audiences are not responding. A
pity. 
21. Homestead–faith-based post-apocalyptic drama from Angel
Studios. A survivalist fantasy. Based on a series of ten, poorly reviewed
novels.
22. Better Man–$110mb!!! I just gasped when I saw the budget. Oh
dear. I love the craziness of this movie. But that's a LOT of money for
such a nutty idea. And forget the nutty idea. It's a musical biopic about
an artist whose music I really like but has virtually no profile outside
the UK. For heaven's sake, Queen is one of the biggest acts in the world
and their biopic cost literally half of this one. Better Man would have
been a big gamble at $30mb. 
23. Hot Pot Artist aka Huo Guo Yi Shu Jia –A young Chinese man
dreams of becoming a film director, but somehow ends up running a
hot pot restaurant for artists, instead. 
24. The Last Showgirl–$2mb for Pamela Anderson's performance as
Vegas showgirl whose revue suddenly closes after 30 years. Not so fast,
Demi, says Anderson. 
25. Fake Dad–Chinese comedy
26. Red One–Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans action/Xmas comedy.
A budget reportedly up to $250mb. It's a theatrical failure, but that
failure would have been just as clear if it had gone straight to
streaming. Now at least it is (almost) paying for a worldwide marketing
blitz and that can only help. Remember how people rented crap movies
at Blockbuster simply because they'd "heard" of it during the theatrical
run? Same idea. 
27. The Firefighters–Korean drama with hot young newbie joining
firefighter squad, only to butt heads with a legendary veteran. 
28. The Fire Inside–$12mb for this indie drama about the true story of
female Olympian boxer from Flint, Michigan. It's a stellar week for
director Barry Jenkins, who wrote and produced this film and sees his
family film  Mufasa: The Lion King finding its audience. 3/24/25, 3:03 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  12, 2025
