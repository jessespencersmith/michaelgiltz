9/08/2004 01:48:00 AMBush is under fire for the first time in his life -- not during battle, asJohn Kerry was, but for avoiding battle by hiding in the NationalGuard. The guns are finally blazing away on this one, with New YorkTimes columnist Nicholas D. Kristof devoting a column to it where hequotes men who served in Alabama who insist they would have seenBush if he'd ever shown up more than once.Bush was clearly derelict -- pilot after pilot says remaining ready tofly was a point of honor for them, even though some, like Bush, weretrained on planes that would never see combat in Vietnam. Therecords clearly show he was absent for months at a time and theONLY person who would claim to have seen Bush in Alabama morethan once unfortunately for Bush insisted he saw the future Prezthere even when Bush admits he wasn't.Plenty of other officers have said they also don't recall thatMr. Bush ever showed up for drills at the base. What'sdifferent about Mr. Mintz is that he remembers activelylooking for Mr. Bush and never finding him.Mr. Mintz says he had heard that Mr. Bush - described as ayoung Texas pilot with political influence - had transferredto the base. He heard that Mr. Bush was also a bachelor, sohe was looking forward to partying together. He's confidentthat he'd remember if Mr. Bush had shown up."I'm sure I would have seen him," Mr. Mintz said yesterday."It's a small unit, and you couldn't go in or out withoutbeing seen. It was too close a space." There were only 25to 30 pilots there, and Mr. Bush - a U.N. ambassador's sonwho had dated Tricia Nixon - would have been particularlymemorable.This issue can and should speak to Bush's integrity and presumablywill play a lot more poorly for him than debating how serious JohnKerry's wounds were while serving in 'Nam. It also ties in with hispossible drug use, that new Kitty Kelley book and the confession bythe politico who got Bush into the Guard and now regrets it.If the media can stay focused for more than one news cycle on this(remember Abu Ghraib, remember Afghanistan for god's sake?) thenthis could start to build up the negatives for Bush.
