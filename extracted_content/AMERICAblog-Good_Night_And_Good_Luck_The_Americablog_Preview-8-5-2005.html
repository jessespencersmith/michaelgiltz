8/05/2005 05:45:00 PMTHIS IS NOT A FILM REVIEW NOR DOES IT CONTAIN SPOILERS(UNLESS YOU'RE IGNORANT OF RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY).George Clooney's second feature film as a director has beentapped to open the 43rd New York Film Festival on Sept. 23and no wonder. The Oscar buzz is already building for thissmart, entertaining look at the showdown between thefear-mongering Sen. Joe McCarthy (seen only in vintage newsclips) and crusading journalist Edward R. Murrow (a great,controlled David Strathairn). Shot in black and white, it's aboutmuch more than McCarthyism -- it's about decency and what itmeans to be an American, the politics of fear, the increasingcommmercialization and dumbing down of TV (back in thegolden age of live drama, mind you) and more."Good Night. And, Good Luck" -- named after Murrow'ssignature sign-off phrase -- confirms Clooney as a serioustalent and is bursting with great actors giving tightno-nonsense performances. Everyone from Robert Downey Jr.and Frank Langella to Patricia Clarkson and Clooney himself istop-notch. And for everyone tired of bloated moviemaking, it'sabout a trim 90 minutes long, with several subplots we haven'teven mentioned. It's going to send more young people intojournalism than any movie since "All The President's Men."But why is Americablog talking about it? Because this movie isincredibly relevant. The far right can't turn this into some leftiediatribe -- this is recent American history, based on the factsand often using historical footage from the HUAC hearings andthe actual words of Murrow and McCarthy. It's the far right'sown unease over Bush's deeply un-American policies (torture,smearing people who disagree with you, attacking anyone whodoesn't support you as weak on terror/communism) that let'sthem understand why this film speaks to us today.You'll thrill to what journalism was capable of and can be againwhen Murrow delivers some stirring commentary. Hear himargue with network executives about taking on McCarthy --when Murrow says passionately that there AREN'T always twobalanced sides to every story -- and you'll want to applaud.Listen to Murrow finish a broadcast by saying we can't fight forfreedom abroad by abandoning it at home and you'll reach fora pen to write those words down. Watch a clip of Eisenhowertrumpet the greatness of America -- how no one has to fearbeing thrown into jail by the government, how we have habeascorpus and are proud of it --and you'll realize how far we'vefallen from that American Dream.This is going to be one of the major films of the year and itdeserves to wake people up to the debates we should behaving today. Clooney isn't a Hollywood liberal trying to attackBush. He doesn't need to. All Clooney needs to do is illustrateour recent past and help us remember the lessons we shouldhave learned. Still, can't wait for that Bill O'Reilly sit-down.Anticipate it eagerly.
