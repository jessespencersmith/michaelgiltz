8/03/2005 12:16:00 AMHere's the first look at some of John Roberts' written responsesto questions asked in writing by the Senate. Among thehighlights:The 10-page questionnaire yielded 83 pages of response. Itincluded information about Judge Roberts's financialassets and net worth - nearly $5.3 million, including astock portfolio worth more than $1.6 million; his workduring Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that decidedthe 2000 election in President Bush's favor; and hismembership, or lack thereof, in the Federalist Society, aconservative legal group. Other documents, released earlierTuesday by the National Archives, offered new informationabout his work for the Justice Department in the Reaganadministration....In his essay on judicial activism, Judge Roberts spoke of theimportance of precedent, a concept particularly importantto those who fear that he would tilt the Supreme Court in amore conservative direction, possibly undoing pastdecisions like Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court rulingthat made abortion legal.He wrote, "Precedent plays an important role inpromoting the stability of the legal system, and asound judicial philosophy should reflect recognitionof the fact that the judge operates within a system ofrules developed over the years by other judgesequally striving to live up to the judicial oath...."On the role of the courts, Mr. Roberts wrote a long article,presumably as a ghostwriter for Mr. Smith, in which heheld that courts should defer to Congress and theexecutive branch whenever possible."Not only are unelected jurists with life tenure less attunedto the popular will than regularly elected officials," heasserted, "but judicial policy making is also inevitablyinadequate or imperfect policy making."Thoughts?
