6/09/2005 10:00:00 AMDavid Brooks has a rather tortured column on AIDS in Africa.He tries to paint Bush's inactions in the best possible light whilestill arguing that much, much more needs to be done. Even theheadline (which he probably didn't write) is wrong: "In Africa,Life After AIDS," it reads, when any responsible observerknows that the worst is still ahead of us. Africa won't have lifeafter AIDS until decades from now and only then if we takeaction today.All he concedes is that, "Obviously, there is still a long wayago." Then Brooks makes a comparison that even he admits isperverse: he compares the underfunded hospitals to SiliconValley in the early '90s.They're facing the problems start-ups face: how to offertreatment to hundreds when you have only one sink andone phone, how to use the survivors who suddenly have therest of their lives to lead.That IS perverse, David. A Silicon Valley start-up is a luxury enjoyedby people with the freedom and wealth to roll the dice on a newcompany that could make them millionaires. Hospitals in Africastarved for resources are a sign of dire necessity and the moral failingof the world community. People are dying and no one cares.Brooks also describes money "rolling in" from the US, which is also alie. Here's the truth: Bush made a big splash by promising to spendan extra $15 billion fighting AIDS in Africa and his words have provenhollow.1. Bush hasn't come close to spending the amount he promised.2. Bush has politicized the funding, placing religious purity ahead ofmedicine and saving lives.3. Bush has defunded effective international groups like the GlobalFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Why? Because theydon't meet his standards of religious purity.4. Bush has forced Uganda to switch from an effective preventionprogram that cut HIV infection in the population from 15% to 6%.What new program does he dangle money in front of the governmentto force them to use? An unproven abstinence only program thatevery responsible health expert says will result in more illness anddeath.Rolling Stone has a decent article detailing the roadblocks Bush hasplaced in front of those trying to help Africa. It proves Brooks iswillfully lying or woefully ignorant when he tries to credit Bush withhelping to fight AIDS on that troubled continent.It's pretty simple. Bush pretends he wants to fight AIDS but won'tbuy condoms. That's like saying you want to fight hunger but won'tbuy any food.
