            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 8 ,  2 0 0 6Jesse Jackson: No More "N" WordHappily, Jesse Jackson isn't just mentioning Michael Richards -- he'salso calling on all rappers, hip-hop artists and black comics to stopusing the "n" word as well. Just as gay people feel free to call each other"fags," many black people in the entertainment world especially say"nigga" constantly. Indeed, no one uses the word more than blackpeople, especially in the media. And if Richards hadn't been on anangry tirade, if he hadn't been mocking and attacking two blackpatrons, wouldn't the question of using that word in a standup act bemuch more complex? Of course, Eminem never uses the word; heknows there are certain lines you don't cross. But surely Jackson andBill Cosby et al are right: any desire to defuse the word and claim it astheir own (a la fag and queer and fairy for gays) has long outlived itsusefulness and now it's just a case of filling up the world's image ofblack people with gangstas and thugs and gold-toothed caricatures ofrappers and the "n" word. The one annoying postscript to this is thatJackson also called for a boycott of the just-out Season Seven of"Seinfeld." Why? Richards has apologized publicly and repeatedly (andsomewhat convincingly albeit in a clueless manner). The show itselfcertainly isn't racist and Richards is only a small part of it creatively.What possible purpose could a boycott of the DVD set serve? And sinceit won't be a successful boycott, why would Jackson idiotically call forone? It's like that college student on "The Daily Show" last nightstaging a hunger strike over his meal plan. You just cheapen theseprotests by calling them willy-nilly for any old reason. The LA Timeshas a good rundown of the issue.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
