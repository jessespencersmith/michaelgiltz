By Andy Propst

MICHAEL GILTZ  | APRIL 21, 2015
SHARE</p>
<p>Cy Coleman is back on Broadway with the wildly acclaimed revival of his
musical On the Twentieth Century  (created with Comden and Green).
Remarkably, the prolific and hugely successful Coleman — think“Witchcraft,” “The Best Is Yet to Come,” “Big Spender,” and many otherstandards — has never been the subject of a biography. That’s changedwith Broadway Direct’s regular contributor Andy Propst, who dove intoColeman’s life with the full cooperation of the late composer’s estate. Hetalks to everyone and reveals a 30-plus-year career rich with successes ranging from the NeilSimon musical Little Me  to City of Angels  (just seen again in London) and The Will Rogers
Follies . It’s a long-overdue appreciation of a major talent. Learn more.
PLAYED IN BRITAIN: MODERN THEATRE IN 100 PLAYSBy Kate Dorney and Frances Gray($29.95, Bloomsbury Methuen Drama)
London theater is heaven for any Americans lucky enough to cross the
pond. But few of us can do that with any regularity, so thank goodness thecity’s shows keep coming to us. For armchair travelers who can’t plunkdown the pounds to sample British theater whenever the mood strikes (andwho wouldn’t love to dash over to see Imelda Staunton in Gypsy  right now?
), this book is the perfect treat. The award-winning, scholarly but accessible work surveysmodern drama, from J.B. Priestley’s landmark postwar classic An Inspector Calls right up toLaura Wade’s Posh  (no, we hadn’t heard of it either). It’s bursting with evocative photographs
from the productions, descriptions of the shows, and insights into why they had such an impact.You can spend hours torturing yourself over the shows you missed, savoring the ones youcaught, promising to read the ones that intrigue the most, and start debating what plays wouldmake a similar list for the U.S. A forward comes courtesy of the late actor Richard Griffiths.

TOMMY CAN’T STOP
By Tim Federle (author) and Mark Fearing (illustrator)($16.99, Disney-Hyperion)</p>
<p>Tim Federle is the Broadway dancer who is making a splash with his
theater-crazy middle-grade books Better Nate Than Ever and its sequel,Five, Six, Seven, Nate!  We haven’t heard the last from Nate, but up now is
Federle’s first picture book, created with illustrator Mark Fearing. Notsurprisingly, Federle has created a hyperactive kid named Tommy. The littleboy’s nonstop bouncing around drives everyone to distraction until his sistersuddenly has a lightbulb moment: tap class! It’s a paean to the joys ofdancing, but any kid who wants to turn their passion into their life’s work (drawing, singing,adding numbers, studying bugs, you name it) will surely learn from Tommy. And, no, there’s noreason to think that author Timmy and star Tommy have anything in common whatsoever. Now
accelerando  with the books, please, Federle! Learn more.
THE PARTNERSHIP
By Pamela Katz($30, Nan A. Talese)
Come to the cabaret! The decadent and fertile Weimar Era has dominated
the popular imagination for decades, thanks especially to the brillianttheatrical work of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. This acclaimed new work —called “colorful, perceptive, and riveting” by Kirkus Reviews — tells the fullstory of their combative collaboration on The Threepenny Opera  and The
Rise and Fall of the City of Mahogonny.  Author Pamela Katz — who scripted
the praised film Hannah Arendt  — also gives full due to the women who
played signature roles in the birth of these works. Because frankly, the cabaret of our dreamswouldn’t be half as memorable without the contributions of actresses Lotte Lenya, Helene
Weigel, and writer Elizabeth Hauptmann. Learn more.
NIGHT LIFE 
By David C. Taylor($25.99, Forge Books)
Usually, it’s the critics who kill a show on Broadway. But in this hard-bitten</p>
<p>noir from debut novelist David C. Taylor, the bodies are literally piling up on
the Great White Way. This 1954 mystery is no breezy backstage romp. Ourhero, Michael Cassidy, is a New York City cop called in when the bodies ofchorus boys start appearing with unnerving regularity. Cassidy is perfect forthe job: His father is a successful Broadway producer and his godfather is aMafia boss. Your typical cop, he’s not. With the McCarthy hearings as anominous backdrop and everyone from the FBI to the mob taking an interest in the case, Cassidyhas his hands full in what should be the start to an intriguing series that takes its theater as
seriously as its crimes. Learn more.
BLACK BROADWAY: AFRICAN AMERICANS ON THE GREAT WHITE WAY
By Stewart F. Lane($39.95, Square One)
Broadway insiders know Stewart F. Lane as the six-time Tony-winning
producer behind shows such as the current hit A Gentleman’s Guide toLove & Murder, as well as co-owner of the Palace Theatre. Lane is also anincreasingly ambitious chronicler of theater history, and his new bookcelebrates and explores the story of African Americans on the Great WhiteWay, as its subtitle puts it. Black Broadway  works in two ways: It is profusely
illustrated and can serve as a handsome coffee table book, but it’s also deeply researched andcan be intensely read for the text alone. It journeys from minstrel shows to the present day, and
theater buffs will enjoy this chronicle of a vital element in Broadway history. Learn more.
THE COLLECTED PLAYS OF ARTHUR MILLER
Edited and Introduced by Tony Kushner($115, Library of America)
Any shortlist of America’s greatest playwrights includes Arthur Miller’s
impressive body of work. He won the Pulitzer Prize; he won multiple TonyAwards; and most important of all, he left behind plays including The</p>
<p>Crucible, All My Sons,  and A View From the Bridge that are produced and
performed all over the world again and again. As proof, look to London,
where the great Antony Sher is tackling Death of a Salesman  for the Royal
Shakespeare Company in a landmark production. Now, the Library ofAmerica has collected his plays in a handsome three-volume set. You get all his works, alongwith the Miller novella that inspired his screenplay for the film The Misfits, as well as editor Tony
Kushner’s impassioned eulogy delivered at the playwright’s funeral in 2005. Learn more.
WORDS WITHOUT MUSIC
By Philip Glass($29.95, Liveright)
Composer Philip Glass is one of the most prolific and acclaimed artists
working today in classical music. Glass might have focused on one keyevent in his life — such as the original mounting of Einstein on the Beach  or
an eye-opening journey to the East. He might have delivered his thoughtson classical music and the best way a would-be composer should preparefor a career. Glass could have focused on his childhood, before the musicstarted in earnest. Instead, he does a little bit of everything. He offers upanecdotes from his youth, like how he smashed unsold LPs so they could be returned asdamaged goods, and recalls how during his first audition for Julliard as a flutist, Glass wasstopped and told, “You don’t really want to play the flute, do you?”; he honors the teachers whomolded him through fear (Nadia Boulanger) and love (Ravi Shankar); and he remembers beingbroke after the sold-out success of Einstein . Mixed in here and there are Glass’s still-scrappy
defenses of his music. Sure to be enjoyed by admirers, it’s probably too discursive to win Glasssome new ones. If you want a good musical introduction to his work, see the film Koyaanisqatsior buy the album Glassworks . If you’re already a fan, rest assured you’ll enjoy Glass in what
ever mode he holds forth here. Learn more.</p>
<p>THE B-SIDE
By Ben Yagoda($27.95, Riverhead)
The songs of Broadway were the songs of popular music for decades. Then
abruptly, in the 1950s, it stopped almost overnight. Instead of popular musicbeing dominated by Berlin, Gershwin, and Porter, people started gobblingup Elvis Presley and nonsense like “How Much Is That Doggie in theWindow?” What happened? Author Ben Yagoda explains it all in this culturalhistory that explores events like the battle between ASCAP and BMI, theimpact of TV, and Frank Sinatra’s feud with Mitch Miller, showing how theyshaped and changed the songs that America danced to and sang along with. Yagoda showshow the arrival of the 78rpm format helped shape and refine songwriting, explains why jazzexploded and evolved after World War II, and much more in a critically acclaimed work that willbe fascinating for anyone who loves the Great American Songbook and wonders why it is frozen
in time. Learn more.
BALANCING ACTS
By Lucy Gray and Hilton Als($24.95, Princeton Architectural Press)
Think being a ballerina is tough? Have you seen the movies and
documentaries in which struggling with weight is a constant oppressiveissue? Imagine doing all that, following your dream, performing at thehighest level . . . and becoming a mother. That’s the focus of this ambitiousproject that combines intimate and revealing photographs shot by LucyGray during a 14-year span, with interviews of the artists and their familiesby Hilton Als of The New Yorker.  The visuals and incisive text tell the story of
three dancers at the San Francisco Ballet who all chose to have children at the peak of theircareers, with all the challenges and rewards one can imagine such a journey would deliver.

1964 SEASON</p>
<p>By Peter Filichia
($29.99, St. Martin’s Press)
The movies have 1939, often called the greatest year for the Hollywood
studios in history. Baseball has the 1927 Yankees. And theater, some wouldsay, had the season that ran from the fall of 1963 through the spring of1964. Most would say the creative heyday was in the 1940s, but it’s hard toargue with Peter Filichia’s fondness for the astonishing talent on displayduring the remarkable season he celebrates here. A fixture on the theaterscene for many years as critic, TV personality, and force on the Drama Deskand other awards, Filichia goes deep into the shows, gossip, and lore behind the season. Justlisting the stars trodding the boards among the 68 new productions will whet your appetite:Barbra Streisand, Carol Channing, Hal Holbrook, Mary Martin, Christopher Plummer, KirkDouglas, Albert Finney, Robert Redford, Carol Burnett, Alec Guinness, Julie Harris, and many,
many more. Learn more.
