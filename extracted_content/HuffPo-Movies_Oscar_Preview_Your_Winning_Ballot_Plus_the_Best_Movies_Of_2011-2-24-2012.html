MY OSCAR BALLOT -- BREAKING IT DOWN AND NAMING THE POTENTIAL SPOILERS
BEST PICTURE  -- The Artist
It's hard to believe a B&W foreign film with modest box office success in the U.S. is the front-runner but
that has to be admitted at this stage. A film from overseas should have won the Best Picture Oscar many
years ago. (I'm still gutted that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  didn't pull it off.) But for those who
find this movie shallow, it could have been worse -- the first foreign film to win Best Picture could have
been Life Is Beautiful.  The Help  did so poorly in everything but acting, it's not the factor here it might
have been. If there's an upset, it will be The Descendants.  But there won't be an upset.
BEST DIRECTOR  -- Michel Hazanavicius for The Artist
The Best Picture and Best Director awards don't always go hand in hand, but they probably will here.Hollywood loves a Valentine and they love a gambler who places their own money on a passion project
and succeeds. Plus Michel and his star/wife Berenice Bejo are charming as heck and have that great dog
in tow everywhere they go. The Academy clearly loved Hugo  as well, but not enough to nominate any of
its actors. Still, Martin Scorsese is the only potential upset here and it's not out of the question.
BEST ACTOR  -- George Clooney for The Descendants
Here's one of the tightest races of the night. Jean Dujardin is the frontrunner for his wonderfully
appealing, George Clooney-like work in The Artist.  He won the SAG award for Best Actor and the smart
money is on him. But I keep thinking the Academy is passionate about The Descendants  (far more than
The Help  and Hugo ). TV ads for the movie with Clooney breaking down in tears at his wife's bedside are
reportedly running nonstop in LA and the movie has been one of the great success stories at the boxoffice this year. I think they want to reward the movie with more than Best Adapted Screenplay and thisis the place to do it. If you want to win your Oscar pool you have to do well in the tech categories andpick an upset in the big races. If you like to play it safe, go with Jean. I'm going with George.
BEST ACTRESS  -- Viola Davis for The Help
Meryl Streep is such a good actress she had us all convinced that her performance in The Iron Lady  was
going to finally win her another Oscar after decades of being an also-ran... even though the movie was
poorly reviewed, did poorly at the box office and annoyed the liberal sensibilities of Oscar voters by soft-soaping such a controversial figure. She's very good as always, but the movie just doesn't stay with you.More to the point, The Help  is one of the big hits of the year and Viola Davis is the heart of the movie
(even though in typical Hollywood fashion it deals with the plight of maids in the racist Deep South bytelling the story of a white woman who risks her social standing to tell their story). Davis is a terrificactress and Streep will have to give an even better performance when her name isn't called and she triesto look delighted.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR  -- Christopher Plummer for Beginners
A career award, though his role in the little-seen Beginners  does press a number of Oscar buttons. The
only question is if he'll make some allusion to his most famous film role in his speech, something like
"Your applause feels like the sound of music to me." Not likely.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS  -- Octavia Spencer for The Help
Like Davis, she's won every guild award in sight. For a while, it seemed like Spencer would be carrying
the banner for the film come awards time, but Davis fought off Streep again and again so they both get towin. For all its flaws, thank goodness people have the taste to reward the maids and not the white ladiesthey worked for. Is there a possible upset here? Melissa McCarthy caused a stir in Bridesmaids  but I
think the movie is too vulgar for Academy voters. Still, this category is often a spoiler and I wouldn't besurprised to see McCarthy or even Jessica Chastain of The Help  being named. Chastain's win would be an
anointing of a new star and recognition for her excellent work in The Tree Of Life, Take Shelter, The Helpand several other films this year. Not out of the question but I believe they'll feel it's in bad taste givenThe Help's story and avoid this.
BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY  -- Woody Allen for Midnight In Paris
BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY  -- Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash for The Descendants,
based on the novel by Kaui Hart HemmingsI'm still a little surprised that the biggest box office success of Woody Allen's career didn't snag his usual

<p>clutch of acting nominations. But the Academy loved this movie -- like The Descendants , another major
word of mouth hit, especially for the middle-aged voters that dominate the Academy (the media age is
roughly 62). I think the major threat is The Artist . If it wins here and for Costumes, the movie is
sweeping and Clooney can stop worrying about what speech he'll give. For Adapted Screenplay, The
Descendants  will win. I have a nutty idea that Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy  might upset, but that's nutty.
Stick with the frontrunner.
BEST ANIMATED FEATURE  -- Rango
How is it that director Gore Verbinksi turned to animation for the first time and made by far the best
film of his career? Rango  looks great, makes clear and repeated nods to classic movies like Chinatown
and the spaghetti western genre, it stars Johnny Depp and made money at the box office. As if that's not
enough, Pixar didn't make a good movie this year and wasn't even nominated. A lock.
BEST FOREIGN FILM  -- Monsieur Lazhar
I hope I'm wrong and that A Separation  wins the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Heck, it should have been
nominated for Best Picture as well. Do not miss this gripping, exceptionally well-made Iranian film that
was good enough to snag a nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a rarity for foreign films. (The
screenwriters have great taste and often make smart nominations like this.) But the "obvious" choice is
rarely the one that wins in the Foreign Film race, for reasons too complicated to go into right now. My
original choice to upset was In Darkness  because it's about the Holocaust. But that movie is a little too
caustic in its approach. So the nutty, leftfield, WTF were they thinking pick is this heartwarming
Canadian film about a schoolteacher. The smart money is on A Separation.
BEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE  -- Undefeated
Another exceptionally difficult category to call. Do they reward Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory  for being
such a committed project that helped bring justice by shining a spotlight on a remarkable case of
railroading teens in a murder case? Do they celebrate Wim Wenders' beautiful 3-D accomplishment andthe career of the late, great Pina Bausch? Do they go all feel-good with Undefeated , a real-life Blind Side ?
(Though The Blind Side  was based on a real story.) I've been thinking the media attention for the case
would tip the scales in favor of Paradise Lost 3 . I'd pick the one movie I saw in this category, Pina ,
simply because it's so lovely. But you can't go wrong with the unexpected crowd-pleaser so I'm ratherrandomly picking  Undefeated . Your guess is as good as mine.
BEST ART DIRECTION  -- Hugo
Assuming The Artist  doesn't sweep and that Hugo  gets some love in the tech categories it dominated,
this one goes to Scorsese's love-fest for the movies.
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY  -- The Tree of Life
Again, The Artist  could sweep and win for its gorgeous black and white look. But the work on The Tree Of
Life was SO stunning that it should be undeniable. War Horse  had the worst  cinematography of the
year. If the Academy confuses its kitsch overkill with artistry, the howl of despair you hear will be coming
from my apartment.
BEST COSTUME DESIGN  -- The Artist
Another very tricky category. The traditional pick would be Anonymous , because it's a lavish period
piece. My friend Howard calls this the Most Costumes award. But that movie truly was anonymous in
every sense and has been so thoroughly forgotten it seems unlikely. And when you think of Hugo , the
costumes do not come to mind. That means it's down to the glamour of The Artist versus the realism of
Jane Eyre . Glamour wins every time. Mind you, the Costume guild gave it to Madonna's movie W./E. ,
which is also period and very glamorous. And this category has been willfully offbeat for the past 10years. Still, that's not how voters think when they're voting; that's just how we think when we're trying topredict  how voters think. Michael O'Connor of Jane Eyre  won before and that never hurts. But I'm
sticking with the "obvious" choice of The Artist.
BEST EDITING  -- The Artist
Sometimes an action film or editing-heavy special effects movie can win here. But there's no tech
heavyweight here. It's down to The Artist versus the legendary Thelma Schoonmaker and her work onHugo . I think it's a toss-up myself because The Artist  might sweep, but Schoonmaker is a powerful name
who has won three times already. Like Scorsese, I think they'll feel she's won enough already and stickwith their heart and go for The Artist.
BEST MAKEUP  -- The Iron Lady
Meryl Streep really did do a marvelous job as Margaret Thatcher and all due credit to her makeup team
for giving Streep the tools to deliver that performance. Watch her smile with delight when they win while

http://t.co/aF6W2ZQh</p>
<p>she's secretly wondering if the Academy thinks the makeup delivers the performance and not her. The
work on Glenn Close for Albert Nobbs  was too subtle to win. If the final Harry Potter  had been
nominated for Best Picture I would have seen this as its consolation prize. It still might pull off an upset,
but The Iron Lady  should win.
BEST SCORE  -- The Artist
This branch should be ashamed of itself for giving the great John Williams not one but two Oscar
nominations for his rote work on two disappointing movies. The Artist  does face some controversy for its
use of extended passages from Vertigo  but that was an artistic choice, not a cheat. The movie is wall to
wall score so I think it will triumph. If not, Howard Shore might sneak in with Hugo .
BEST SONG  -- "Man Or Muppet" from The Muppets
The biggest disappointment of the night for me is that we don't get to see Jason Segal and the Muppetsperform this charming tune. The song from Rio  is a group sing-along I can't imagine winning, though
voters may be swayed by the name of Sergio Mendes. Still I doubt it. And why the heck did they only
nominate two songs? I still haven't heard a good explanation of why. And here's hoping the brilliant idea
of having the Muppets host the show some year comes through. Heck, it airs on ABC which is owned by
Disney which owns the Muppets, so that should be a no-brainer, especially since their movie was acommercial success. Animal intros the Best Song, Miss Piggy flirts with actors and tries to hog thespotlight, Kermit is gracious and unassuming...the jokes practically write themselves and actors wouldlove to be paired with muppets while presenting awards. Do it!
BEST SOUND EDITING  -- Hugo
BEST SOUND MIXING  -- Hugo
One of the most mysterious categories of all for Oscar voters, who have a vague idea of how editing and
other tech specialties work but really don't understand sound. Heck, neither do I, particularly. Movies
like Transformers: Dark Of The Moon often dominate here, but not this year.
BEST VISUAL EFFECTS  -- Rise of the Planet of the Apes
Here's the most obvious spot for the final Harry Potter to get a pat on the back. But I believe the Oscar
push for actor Andy Serkis really educated voters on the amazing technical achievement of Rise of thePlanet of the Apes . It was a ground-breaking leap forward in using motion capture to let an actor create a
genuine performance and I think the Apes  will triumph. If you're really aggrieved HP7P2  wasn't
nominated for Best Picture, you may want to plug for it here because you think Oscar voters will beembarrassed by that omission. But Oscar voters don't really do "embarrassment," so I' sticking with Apes .
BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT  -- Saving Face
This seems the clearest winner to me in the shorts categories. it happens to be the best of the shorts, butthat's rarely the point. It also juggles several stories gracefully: you get women's rights, a court battle andthe charity work of a plastic surgeon all wrapped up in one tale about the horrifying practice of men inPakistan throwing acid on the faces of wives and women they want to punish. I'll be shocked if this loses.
BEST LIVE ACTON SHORT  -- Raju
Often, at least two of the three shorts categories are easy to pick if you've seen them. The crowd-pleasers
just jump out. Not this year. We've got three light comedies, one serious drama and one muddled effortwith the only name actors and name director ( The Shore  with Ciaran Hinds and Terry George). George
has been nominated in major categories before so he seems like a frontrunner. But Raju  has a noble tale
of adoption, kidnapping and features white people in India. It's a dead heat but since The Shore  is pretty
lightweight throughout, I'm going to give it to the most "serious" movie on the list. But the namerecognition of The Shore could be a serious draw for Oscar voters.
BEST ANIMATED SHORT  -- A Morning Stroll
Another very hard category to call. Many people are predicting the warm but rather long tale The
Fantastic Flying Books Of Mr. Morris Lessmore  and there's no question the elderly crowd I saw it with
oohed and aahed over it. On the other hand, Pixar's entry La Luna  was short and sweet and much
punchier with a nice Italian air that makes it feel very different from their many other winners in this
category. But A Morning Stroll  was the cleverest and most ambitious in its tale of a chicken that goes for
a morning stroll, revealing the changes in the world via different animated styles and by jumping forwardin time by 50 years each time it goes out for a walk. I just wish the "button" at the end were stronger.And Dimanche  had the most distinctive animation. I'd be surprised by absolutely none of them except the
weak Wild Life.  My heart says La Luna,  my brain says go with the top pick of others and choose
Fantastic Flying Books  but my gut says this category has been very envelope-pushing in recent years and
that A Morning Stroll will continue that trend in the absence of a clear front-runner.
So that's my Oscar ballot. Good luck with your pool! Now here are my picks for the best films of 2011.</p>

Wow, Michael, you get the Oscar for best list of best pictures. I might have snuck "Another Earth,"
"Margin Call" or "Take Shelter" in somewhere, and I loved "Buck" and "Cinema Komunisto," which
has only been around on the festival circuit. But I don't know how I'd edit your choices.
01:10 PM on 02/28/2012
Thanks for commenting Joseph. Take Shelter is on my list of course. I liked both margin
call and Another Earth, both of which I'd give three stars to (and Another Earth almostmade my list).I still need to see Buck, which is on my pile of DVDs to watch and hadn't
even heard of Cinema Komunisto. Thanks for the tips.
06:37 PM on 02/26/2012
Thank you for leaving Hugo off the 10 Best List. It was one of the worst movies I saw in 2011. Not
just me, I turned to my friend when we left the theater after being silent throughout, and we saidsimultaneously, "What a horrible movie!" The very name of Scorcese must work like crack on critics
and cloud their judgement.
10:34 AM on 02/27/2012
You are, of course, entitle to your opinion
but I left the theatre saying to myselfWow
What a great movie
How enjoyable
and
I bet that somewhere there is someone gnashing teeth and saying What a dreradful movie,You haven't let me down
12:09 PM on 02/26/2012
Solid. But you say Arthur Christmas is better than your prediction to win Best Picture--The Artist?Come on now.
And my opinion is that The Artist's long run of award success won't continue as heavily as people
think tonight at the Oscars. I bet they win 3 or 4 out of 10, and I don't think one of them will be BestPicture. If it is, The Artist won't win Best Director.
I guess I have a hard time seeing a silent black and white film winning the two biggest categories at
the Oscars for 2011. I predict Payne wins for The Descendants, Dujardin wins for Best Actor, andPicture goes to either The Artist, Descendants, or The Help. I have a feeling The Help may sneak
away with this one--but in the end I wouldn't be surprised if The Artist steals the major awards from
the talkies.Recency   | Popularity Page:  1 2  Next  ›  Last  »  (2 total)

I liked The Artist but don't see it as the Best Picture of the year; it's a pleasant gimmick. I couldn't
stand Hugo and wouldn't give it any awards. But the Academy voters will undoubtedly disappointme as they so often do.Agree with the kudos for Tree of Life, but my favorites this year in terms of pure entertainment were
Drive, Moneyball, and The Descendants.
01:11 PM on 02/28/2012
You can always count on the Academy voters to frustrate you!
11:28 PM on 02/25/2012
My picks, based on what I think should and would be cool to win:
Best Pic = ArtistBest Director = Artist
Best Actor = Pitt
Best Actress = Mara (nice upset)Supporting Actor = PlummerSupporting Actress = Spencer (these last 2 total locks)Animated = RangoOrig Screenplay = Midnight/ParisAdapted Screenplay = MoneyballArt Direction = Harry Potter (an actually good 'consolation' win)
Cinematography = Tree/Life
Costumes = Artist (so seamless, pun intended)Editing = Dragon TattooMakeup = Albert Nobbs (kinda a consolation for not awarding Glenn)Score = ArtistVisual Effects = Harry Potter (undeniable)
Sorry, Scorsese, I'm not feeling Hugo this year.
And why wasn't Fincher nom'd for Best Picture or Director for 'Tattoo'?Nor the score for 'Tattoo,' that music was amazing!
Billy Crystal is such a yawner choice, who are they trying to attract, sheesh??
Anyway, my ballot is ready, bring on the show!
12:12 PM on 02/26/2012
If Brad Pitt OR Rooney Mara win, I will let you shoot me in the face. 
They each have literally a 0% chance of winning. Seriously, it's been measured. Close and
Streep in one category..and then Dujardin and Clooney. It was nearly an outrage that Pitt
was even nominated.
12:12 PM on 02/26/2012
Oh and to qualify that....I am pretty much in love with Rooney Mara and would love if shewon. But she won't...maybe in the next few years. Definitely in her lifetime.Permalink  | Share it

"The Rise of The Planet of the Apes" should have been nominated for Best Picture because it was
was. Streep should win Best Actress. The category is not foe Best Film, but Best Actress.ArtDirection definitely should go to "Hugo". Simply gorgeous.
I have a large framed poster of that train crashing through the station wall down into the street (yes,
it really happened) and at La Gare Montparnasse in 1895. To see the actual photos go to:

I think I agree with you on which films/performers you think will win. I'm so happy I'm not the only
one who didn't like "The Help," aside for the performances. At least I don't think it's best picture
nomination worthy. Octavia Spencer should certainly win in the supporting category, but Meryl
Streep blew me away in "Iron Lady." Her performance is the only reason I stayed awake through
the whole thing. I wish Pitt would win best actor, but I Clooney was outstanding as well.www.thelettersproject.org

I can see a genuine Academy-Award-quality silent film any day of the week. The Artist is a gimmick,nothing more. As for the return of Billy Crystal? Yawn. This may be the first year in my long life thatI've missed the awards, but I honestly can't see much to look forward to.
10:29 AM on 02/25/2012
When I was a kid I really enjoyed watching movies. Not so much anymore. Without me going into alot of reasons let's just call it a personal preference. Up until the age of nine I used to watch theOscar's. Then one day I said to myself. Hey all these decisions are pretty much all about politics
and money. As far as I can see it, it really doesn't have much to do with the quality of most of the
productions. I'm not saying don't watch the Oscar's. Some of the entertainment is really pretty good.
All I'm saying is if you expect awards given to the best of the best chances are you will be badly
disappointed.
09:13 PM on 02/25/2012
I'm very selective about even going to a movie theater today. there's so much crap e.g.,
shoot'em ups and explosions and Sci-Fi crap like those Transformer films. I usually watchat home on DVD and mostly foreign films and those films few films we make that are good.
As for the Oscars; it's a guilty pleasure.

I gave up when Brokeback lost to Crash. Ernest Borgnine didn't even see it and voted against it.HUFFPOST SUPER USER

Jean Dujardin needs to win Best Actor!

Most egregious ommission. Albert Brooks in Drive deserved at least a nomination for Best
Supporting Actor. He was simply brilliant. How they could nominate Jonah Hill (who I like) instead ofBrooks is beyond me.

I do not go to movies. I used to , but got tired of being disappointed. Ms. Daryl Hannah was beinginterviewed by a talk show host , many years ago. Her reply pretty much says it for me: "I'd ratherwatch any of the old movies then the best of the new ones".
I'll be watching on Sunday night , but , I'll be channel surfing between Billy Crystal spots.

I hear you. TCM and AMC capture my attention more often than not. "The Young
Philadelphians" recently aired on TCM and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I'm not a movie snob, but many films today seem to lack the storytelling of past films, but
then, I don't watch every film that is released. 
Just like "Midnight in Paris," we sometimes think that things past are much better than
things of today...some things. Many in society wouldn't want to return to the past.

" we sometimes think that things past are much better than things of today...somethings. Many in society wouldn't want to return to the past."
Yes. Too bad we can't live in the past with the wisdom of the future. 
If we could, I certainly would not have wasted all that money on 8 track music
cassettes and VHS video tapes. And, the thought of running to the outhouse in themiddle of a dark and snowy night , just puts my brain in shudder shock!HUFFPOST BLOGGER

Clooney didn't even deserve a nomination. Plenty of actors could've played that role. The only time
where I saw him do any real acting was when he was running to his friends house.

Boy, opinions differ. I thought Clooney was great.

The film from overseas that should have been Best Picture several years ago was "Lives of Others"from Germany.One 2011 movie that too many people missed was "Higher Ground," directed by and starring VeraFarmiga. I only went to it because a friend was involved with making it, but I was extremely
pleasantly surprised at what an original and powerful movie it was.

Actually, "La Grande Illusion" should have won Best Picture in '38. It was actually
nominated, but lost to "You Can't Take It With You". Having seen both, I just cannot believethat YCTIWY won over Grand Illusion, it is pure insanity! 'Das Leben der Anderen' was
good though, I'll agree with you on that.
