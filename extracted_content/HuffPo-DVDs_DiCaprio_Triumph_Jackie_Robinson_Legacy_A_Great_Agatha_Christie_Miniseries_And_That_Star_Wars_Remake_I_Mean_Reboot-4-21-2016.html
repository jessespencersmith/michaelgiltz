<p>THE REVENANT  ($39.99 BluRay; 20th Century Fox)
STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Walt Disney Studios)
Two movies widely recognized as critical and popular successes...and all I can do is harrumph. I read the
novel The Revenant  to prepare for the movie and thought it was a fun, propulsive tale. Pure adventure but with
an intriguingly off-kilter ending. No big finale after a novel's worth of building and building to said showdown.It reminded me in a way of Elmore Leonard's great Western Valdez Is Coming.  But here, there's just a touch of
mysticism, of communing with nature. I thought, "Huh! That'll be interesting to see. I wonder how they'll pull itoff." Well, they didn't even try. Rather hilariously, they ignore the great ending of the novel and just have aboring old, mano-a-mano showdown that made me laugh knowing what I knew and having spent the wholemovie anticipating the non-showdown showdown. That's not the only mistake for this movie that will surelysuffer when looked back on even ten years from now. The book was a model of efficiency. But the moviedumbed down most everything. Various tribes of Indians attack the white men intruding on their territories. Butsince that might make them look savage, the movie creates an Indian princess held hostage and threatenedwith rape (but seemingly not actually raped) so the Indians would have a "reason" to attack white men, as ifwhite men invading their world wasn't reason enough. Worse, one Indian is given a noble speech about howbad white men are, in case we missed the point. Ditto our hero, played very well by Leonardo DiCaprio. In thenovel, he's abandoned when wounded by two men who even steal his only means of self-defense. Apparentlythat's not enough to justify a passionate desire for revenge. So he's given a son they kill off-handedly soLeo's revenge will seem purer. He's also given an indian wife, now dead, who appears to him in dreams,smiling mystically when he is soaked in blood because of course she approves. All this means the beautifulcinematography is undermined by hocus-pocus, again because the simple beauty of nature isn't enough. Ifyou watch the movie cold, it will be fine in one viewing but you'll hardly be drawn back. If you've read thegood, not great, book, even once is too much.</p>
<p>Similarly, Star Wars: The Force Awakens  is a let down. It's not the crushing let-down of Phantom Menace.  It
was hard to convince yourself that  movie was good even as you watched it. But this time around, the vibe is
right, the look is right, the old gang is back and it actually feels  like a Star Wars  movie. They're homages to
those Saturday morning serials (just like Indiana Jones franchise) and frankly it's been 33 years since we've
seen a "new" chapter. (Those flashbacks to 1-3 don't count.) So, great! Unfortunately, once it's over and youcan happily breathe again because it didn't totally suck, you have to admit it also wasn't that good. In fact,wait a second, dear God, it's the EXACT SAME PLOT AS STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE  aka frickin' Star Wars, as
far as I'm concerned. It's not the next chapter, it's not even a reboot really. It's almost a note for note remake.Most tiresome are the jokey, nudge-nudge references to the earlier movies that constantly take place. And I'madmirably annoyed as only a leftie New Yorker could be over the treatment of Chewbacca. I mean, really, he'sSTILL not the pilot of the Millennium Falcon, just the co-pilot? That's kind of absurd, really. As with so manyof these franchises, you watch it and sort of enjoy what you can and immediately kindle a new hope: maybethe next one will be really good. God knows, I dig the trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
JACKIE ROBINSON  ($24.99 DVD; PBS)
I'm almost certain I'm saying the same thing every other reviewer of this four hour documentary by Ken Burnshas said before. Hasn't Jackie Robinson been done already, from an entire episode of Baseball  to feature films
to biographies? Well, not nearly enough, apparently. This work tells the full arc of Robinson's life and it's afascinating one. Just start watching and in ten minutes you'll know you made the right decision.</p>
<p>ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion)
I was just a dumb kid the first time I saw Only Angels Have Wings  at the Olde Tyme Movie House, a revival
theater in South Florida in the 1970s. Every week they showed a classic Hollywood film. I thought movies
about adults that were funny and mature and sophisticated and sexy and daring and captivating and yetsomehow fine for the whole family were a dime a dozen. Today, they seem like a unicorn, a magical creaturewe spot once in a great while from the studios of today, but rarely enough that we're never sure if the latestspotting will be the last one in our lifetime. I was also too dumb to know that director Howard Hawks wasonce dismissed as a genre director, sort of a glorified hack churning out entertainments until various critics(not just the French), said holy cow, these guys directed a lot of great movies. Here you've got Cary Grantrunning an airmail service in the middle of nowhere. Flying the planes is dangerous. Landing them is evenmore dangerous. Great broads like Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth are along for the ride but it's a manly man'sworld. What a corker! It was released in 1939, often dubbed the greatest year in movie history and this is justone of many, many reasons. But it's a damn good one and this new edition from Criterion is spotless, from thegreat print to great extras like a radio play version with most of the cast and a chat between Hawks and PeterBogdanovich.</p>
<p>EPISODES SEASON 4  ($29.98 DVD; Showtime)
THE ODD COUPLE SEASON ONE  ($36.98 DVD: Paramount)
CASUAL SEASON ONE  ($29.98 DVD; Lionsgate)
GRACE AND FRANKIE SEASON 1  ($29.98 DVD; Lionsgate)
SILICON VALLEY SEASON TWO  ($34.98 BluRay; HBO Studios)
When it came to the cast of Friends , I handicapped Matthew Perry as the One Most Likely To Succeed. But
darned if Matt LeBlanc isn't the guy piling on the interesting credits, from hosting Top Gear  to this British-US
sitcom Episodes , a deft spoof of Hollywood and the star system. The next season of Episodes will be its last,
ending in 2017 once they figure out when to film it around all of LeBlanc's other commitments.
Meanwhile, Perry is in the far less interesting reboot of The Odd Couple.  Nothing wrong with that in theory; it's
been done one way or another countless times before and will be countless times again. The twist here is that
Perry is playing the slob...and that's where the inventiveness ends. Maybe they'll find their reason for being inseason two.
Increasingly, the action for sitcoms is not found on the major networks but farther afield, whether it's cable or
even streaming services like Hulu. They've got Casual , created by Zander Lehmann and given a stamp of
approval by Jason Reitman. A divorced single mom and her brother live together, raising her daughter andtrying to try try again on the dating scene. The Golden Globes were savvy enough to nominate it for BestComedy (they've got a thing for Reitman) and when you're trying to decide what to watch among the ever-growing list of good TV, that's as good a marker as any.
The pleasures to be had from Netflix's Grace And Frankie  are certainly modest. But reuniting two-thirds of 9 To</p>
<p>5 and letting them goof off around each other is surprisingly endearing if not earth-shaking. Lily Tomlin is so
loopy you're almost surprised when she remembers her lines and Jane Fonda is amusing when tart. Sure theirhusbands left them for true love...with each other. But that's nothing compared to the daily indignity ofgrowing older in a youth-obsessed world. Mild but consistent fun.
Finally, HBO is in dire trouble when it comes to new dramas. But its sitcoms are in solid shape, from Veep  and
Girls (both of which should indeed wind it up) to Silicon Valley, a look a the world of tech start-ups. Its co-
creator is Mike Judge, who has an impeccable track record. Beavis and Butthead  may be a little over-praised
but it's distinctive and goofy and pretty awesome. (And the movie is better.) The animated sitcom King Of The
Hill is probably the most underrated sitcom of the past few decades, capturing middle America without
condescension or pandering (no small feat). Throw in the cult classic movie Office Space  and his couch-potty
invention in Idiocracy  and you've got yourself a heck of a resume. Now he can lay claim to this show, battling it
out with AMC for a look at the oh-so-spoofable insular world of Silicon Valley and its nerdy denizens. ElonMusk may not get the joke, but the people being tweaked usually don't.
LOSING GROUND  ($39.99 BluRay; Milestone Films)
One is torn between bemoaning what might have been and celebrating what is -- let's lean towards the latter.Writer-director Kathleen Collins died too young of cancer at 46, but not before delivering this acclaimedfeature film debut, a movie rescued from oblivion by MIlestone Films. A professor of philosophy sees herhusband's eye a'wandering and decides to take up a student's offer to act in his student film. And that wasbefore realizing her co-star would be the student's uncle, a magnetic fellow who'd already begun flirting withher. Seret Scott holds the screen beautifully, Bill Gunn is solid as her husband and Duane Jones ( Night OfThe
Living Dead, Ganga & Hess, Beat Street
) is outstanding as Duke, the man who can philosophize with the best</p>
<p>of them. But it's a tribute above all to the unfulfilled potential of Collins who in 1982 at least proved she could
deliver the goods. Included as a bonus feature is her 1980 work The Cruz Brothers and Miss Molloy,  a 54
minute film which I've yet to watch.</p>
<p>BANSHEE: COMPLETE THIRD SEASON  ($34.98 BluRay; HBO Studios)
PRISONERS' WIVES COMPLETE COLLECTION  ($59.99 DVD: Acorn)</p>
<p>HAVEN: COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON ($49.98 BluRay; Entertainment One)
Almost by accident, US companies have cotttoned on to the fact that producing 22 episodes of a drama or
sitcom every season is exceptionally difficult. More importantly, they now realize it's often not good forbusiness either. Some shows aren't meant  to run 100 episodes. Between tentative orders for eight or ten
episodes for the first season and not being able to afford cranking them out 22 at a time, cable and streamingchannels almost by default have discovered that one size doesn't fit all. A show like Banshee  has a very
particular premise about a guy just out of prison and facing off with organized crime. To tell the story right, itcan't be dragged out forever. And if they want to make money off people binge-watching the entire run orbuying a BluRay set, then letting the show run its course and stop -- giving viewers a beginning and a middleand an end -- is actually more profitable than destroying the experience by ramping up production. So nowwe've got season three of Banshee  with the last eight episodes already airing on Cinemax. They'll have 33
episodes in all and that's just fine. Similarly, the acclaimed Prisoners' Wives  from the UK shows the life of
wives when their loved one is put behind bars. It's quiet, observant and funny. Season one had six episodes.season two had four. Maybe there won't be any more. That's fine too. Haven  is most like the major network
shows of old. But it's an offbeat sci-fi series spun off from a Stephen King tale and it too has a specificbeginning and middle and end, all centering around a small town in Maine that is beset by supernaturaldoings. Endlessly stretching it out would frustrate everyone! So you've got four seasons of 13 episodes each.And a fifth and final season...of 26 episodes. Does that make sense? Not really. But you get 78 episodes in alland the knowledge that they could prepare for the finale with their eyes wide open. Is all this mapped out atthe beginning of every series? Of course not. Is the temptation to keep a show like Breaking Bad  going and
going awfully strong? Of course. But thanks to so many outlets vying for content, more and more we're seeingshows being given at least a chance to end on their own terms.</p>
<p>THE LADY IN THE VAN  ($34.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Home Entertainment)
I was awfully lucky to see Maggie Smith on stage in London performing in the Alan Bennett play The Lady In
The Van. Based on an event in the playwright's life, it was about a somewhat homeless, fitfully eccentricwoman who parked her van in the driveway of a playwright one day and stayed put. For years. It was ashowcase for Smith, who could bring this creature to endearingly eccentric life without ever actually makingher cutesy. Never once did Smith deign to make the lady in the van merely amusing or god forbid adorablyamusing or worse of all sentimental. She was enraging and funny and a little frightening. All in all it was a fineevening of theater though not one of Bennett's best. But my eyebrows rose when hearing they were turning itinto a movie. Was that wise? It was not. Whatever pleasure one received from Smith's impeccably floridperformance, her lady in the van was very much a creature of the stage. The more constrained realism of filmwould not be kind to this pretty flimsy excuse for a tale. And indeed it isn't, despite the valiant efforts of allinvolved. Best to have left well enough alone.</p>
<p>DEAD PIGEON ON BEETHOVEN STREET  ($29.95 BluRay; Olive Films)
TRY AND GET ME!  ($29.95 BluRay; Olive Films)</p>
<p>AND THEN THERE WERE NONE  ($34.99 BluRayl Acorn)
Here are two tough noirs and a tough -- yes, tough -- Agatha Christie to finish off this column. Okay, so
director Samuel Fuller helped a German critic snag interviews with Hawks and Ford for a documentary filmproject. In thanks he was offered the chance to direct an episode of a German crime drama in 1974. Thatexpanded into an English language film vaguely inspired by the Profumo affair called Dead Pigeon OnBeethoven Street.  Now it's been expanded by 25 minutes to a more complete director's cut and is widely
available for the first time in ages if not ever in its full form. For fans of Fuller, one of the more frustrated ofgreat directors, this is a rare if unusual treat.
Equally rare is director Cy Endfield's noir with Lloyd Bridges as a ruthless manipulator and a lot to say about
journalistic ethics and our violence-saturated society. It's tough and cold and a genuine B movie, free thus tosay and do as it pleases with only nominal nods towards the decency codes that once ruled Hollywood. TryAnd Get Me!  is for hardcore noir fans.
Most anyone, however, should enjoy this new miniseries adaptation by the BBC of Agatha Christie's And ThenThere Were None.  Even people who've never read the novel or seen one of its many adaptations know the
premise, if only because it's been lifted or satirized so many times since. A group of people is invited to anisolated location. They don't know each other or their host. But it's soon clear the host has a grudge --seemingly a valid one -- against each and every one of them. And the host is going to kill them off, one byone. From the first stage adaptation on, the cold-hearted conceit of the book has been softened. Not here. Anexcellent cast including the likes of Sam Neill, Miranda Richardson and Charles Dance is let loose in a storythat does full justice to Christie's original story, as black as any noir. Acclaimed in the UK, it seems set to bethe definitive version for years to come.
