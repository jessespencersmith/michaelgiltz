<p>Dazed and Confused/Fast Times at Ridgemont High  ($26.98 each on BluRay; UnIversal) -- I love Dazed
and Confused  for the remarkable group of actors they found -- full credit to casting director Don Phillips
for a Hall of Fame job on this one -- its very specific sense of place and time (the last day of school in
1976), and its ability to show the high school experience as it is, rather than the heightened sense ofimportance that a teenage perspective gives those years or high school as a commentary on society. It iseasily the high point in director Richard Linklater's career. Fast Times  attempted a similar tone and to
most people's minds succeeded. It's an "expose" showing what high school is really like; I love the sceneof a girl losing her virginity in the dugout by a baseball diamond. It's raw and dull and unromantic
enough to have probably convinced a generation of girls to maybe wait a year or two. But the broad
comedy of the hilarious Sean Penn seems at odds with that. For that and many other reasons, Fast Timesdoes not make my list.
THE BEST HIGH SCHOOL FILMS OF ALL TIME -- REVISED
After reading through all the comments posted so far, I've revised the list to include some movies I had
forgotten or that you made me reconsider. But I'm still keeping "Breaking Away" -- even if it DOES takeplace during the summer after high school!
1. The Last Picture Show
2. Dazed and Confused
3. Rebel Without A Cause
4. Rushmore
5. The Class/Entre Les Murs
6. Risky Business
7. Donnie Darko
8. Clueless
9. High School  (Frederick Wiseman documentary)
10. The Breakfast Club
11. The Belles Of St. Trinians
12. Friday Night Lights
13. Election
14. Brick
15. Heathers 
16. Breaking Away
Now remember, I've updated the list so don't wonder why people are complaining that I skipped, say,
Heathers  when it's on the list. It's on the list now because I listened to them. As for all the movies I didn't
list, I might have loved the movie but felt it was "really" about sports ( Hoop Dreams, Hoosiers)  or the
arts ( Fame ) or being gay (Another Country, Get Real) or being bullied ( My Bodyguard ) or an evil mother
(Carrie, The Virgin Suicides ) or adults ( Grease  just doesn't feel like high school to me) and so on. Or
maybe I just didn't like it. So what's your favorite high school movie of all time?

<p>NAKED ON BLURAY  ($39.95; Criterion) -- I am NOT suggesting people start doing remakes of great
movies. Usually, there's no point. But it does seem a bit unfair that only David Thewlis gets to tackle the
role of the relentlessly verbal Johnny, one of the most corrosive and fascinating characters in film.Director Mike Leigh gave Thewlis full rein in this 1993 drama and of course Criterion presents it nicely --extras include a BBC interview of Leigh by authot Will Self and an interview with Neil LaBute (he's a fan,what a shock!), as well as an earlier short that Leigh did with Thewlis. But if Naked were a play, actorafter actor would get to dig into those monologues and get a chance to put their own spin on this likablyunlikable character. Surely at the very least actors must use these monologues for auditions and just tostretch their muscles. Great stuff.
BILL MOYERS: GOD AND POLITICS  ($49.99; Athena) 
LEON MORIN, PRIEST  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- With the Republican field of Presidential
candidates crowded by people who avidly appeal to the Religious Right, insist their faith trumps scientificfact and promise to enshrine their religious beliefs into law, it's high time to listen to the calm andreasoned insights of Bill Moyers as he discusses the mixing of religion and higher office with his three

<p>episodes of God and Politics. Originally broadcast in the 1980s, it's a welcome reminder that religion and
politics have been mixing since our nation's founding and that listening can still provide some insight asto what is truly motivating someone. Substantial bonuses include a 2006 Moyers documentary aboutevangelicals embracing Bible-based environmentalism, and related segments from his much-missed TV
series Now with Bill Moyers. An unexpected look at faith comes from French director Jean-Pierre
Melville, who delivers one of the sexiest and yet respectful looks at Christianity in Leon Morin, Priest.
Jean-Paul Belmondo is the seriously attractive priest in a small town in Nazi-occupied France. His
confessional is bursting at the seams with local women who want some quality time, none more so than
Emmanuelle Riva, a widow who doesn't even really believe. The Thorn Birds this isn't, but the movie
clearly savors the sexual tension as the widow is slowly drawn into embracing her faith. Presented withthe usual care by Criterion.
THE BIG LEBOWSKI LIMITED EDITION  ($29.98 on BluRay; Focus Features) -- The Coen
Brothers' much-loved cult comedy comes to BluRay. It has been packaged and repackaged so many timesthat the handful of new extras are nice but not essential. If you already own the movie, they're no reasonto fork out more money. On the other hand, the movie has never looked great on DVD. The BluRay isdefinitely an improvement if not definitive. This surely is the role that Jeff Bridges should have won hisfirst Oscar for (if not earlier). Of course, the Academy Awards look down on comedy. But Bridges wouldhave been a much better winner than Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful.  Bridges wasn't even
nominated that year, with the Oscars dominated by the usual brooding performances, in this case TomHanks for Saving Private Ryan,  Ian McKellen for Gods and Monsters,  Nick Nolte in Affliction  and
Edward Norton in American History X.

<p>OMNIBUS: AMERICAN PROFILES  ($39.98; EOne/Archive Of American Television)
THE MUSIC ROOM  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- How many segments shown on 20/20 or the current
Nightline would be insightful and interesting to watch decades from now? Precious few I imagine.
Perhaps only 60 Minutes in the US still does substantial profiles of artists and other pieces that will standthe test of time. And even those are usually only 20 minutes long at best. So what a treat it is to dive intothis collection from Omnibus, the cultural program that aired mostly on CBS in the 1950s. High brow? Itdidn't even have commercials most of the time. Hosted by Alistair Cooke (and a training ground for DonHewitt of 60 Minutes), this show encompassed everything from excerpts from operas and musicals toadaptations of short stories and documentaries. This all too short set contains two DVDs and more than6 hours of programming, including everything from profiles and chats with Frank Lloyd Wright andWilliam Faulkner to pieces with Pearl Buck, James Thurber and Leonard Bernstein to looks at the NewYork Times, Grand Central and "Doctor Seuss Explores The Museum That Ought To Be." Great stuff.
Satyajit Ray's The Music Room  is not merely a time capsule. It's a moving drama about an aristocrat
desperately trying to keep up appearances and a vanishing way of life. The heart of his world is the music
room and like with Omnibus , fans can savor glimpses of some of the top musicians of India when this
movie was made in 1958. Copious extras include a feature length documentary about Ray, video from aroundtable interview including Ray, a chat with his biographer and more.
DARK DAYS  ($34.99; Oscilloscope) -- Omnibus would have been proud to devote an entire episode to
this 84 minute documentary. Director Marc Singer reveals the bizarre, unexpected society of homelesspeople who have carved out a life for themselves inside abandoned train tunnels deep beneath New YorkCity. Shot in black and white by the homeless people themselves along with Singer (who spent six yearsworking on the film), it's a true original. Extras include Singer returning to the tunnels 10 years later tosee what has happened to the residents of this parallel world.</p>
<p>HIGH AND LOW  ($39.95 on BluRay; Criterion) -- This corker of a thriller is one of director Akira
Kurosawa's best non-samurai movies. Toshiro Mifune is the wealthy businessman who just wants to
make high quality shoes for women. When his child is kidnapped, everything in his world is threatened --he'll either lose control of his company and throw his family into eternal debt or lose his child. Based onan Ed McBain novel, half the film focuses on Mifune and half on the seedy underworld. Highlightsinclude a stunning train sequence, many fascinating glimpses of the Japanese police force and a tone ofrighteous anger about kidnapping that even reportedly convinced Japan to strengthen its too-lenient lawsfor abducting people. The BluRay looks smashing and duplicates all the fine extras from the DVD,including a substantial documentary about the making of this film and a rare video chat with Mifune.
DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY  ($29.95; Lorber) -- True, it's not like reality TV was invented with The
Real World -- it's been around since TV began. And navel-gazing books and films have been around sincepen was put to paper and film loaded in a camera. Still, this oddball 1967 mockumentary by Jim McBridefeels awfully prescient as it shows David collapsing in on himself as his girlfriend gets bored with himand he's soon reduced to peeking at neighbors and staring at the TV. Dead-on satire, this DVD releasealso contains three bonus shorts by McBride, who went on to make the fun drama The Big Easy,  but also
made a horrific remake of Breathless and a TV biopic of Meat Loaf and must have said to himself, "Whatthe heck happened here?"
