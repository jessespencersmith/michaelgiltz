11/05/2004 03:21:00 AMA good, cynical LA Times editorial shows how Bush got a lot of ruraland exurban folk to vote for him cause he shares their Christianvalues -- like fighting the homos. But his real priorities are quitedifferent: lower taxes for the rich and privatizing Social Security soaverage folk can sink or swim in their retirement depending on howsavvy they are in playing the stock market."Meanwhile, what about opposing gay marriage, the one mandateBush might legitimately claim? Earlier this year, Bush barely lifted afinger in support of a constitutional amendment banning it. (Comparethis to the furious arm-twisting he performs to get moderates to backhis tax cuts.) If he has a mandate to do anything, it's to bring up theamendment again. However, he's said nothing about doing so, andnobody expects him to," writes Jonathan Chait in the LA Times."No surprise there — it's hardly in the Republican Party's interest. Ifgay marriage is banned everywhere, what's going to bring all thoseheartland conservatives to the polls next time?"
