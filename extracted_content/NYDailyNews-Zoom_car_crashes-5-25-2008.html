            <p>AUTO FOCUS
ith drivers these days distracted
by cell phones, GPS devices, iPods,
portable DVD players and grande
lattes to go, it's a miracle there aren't
more car accidents. Happily, Hollywood is ready
to take up the slack - and not just bY
crashing and buming would-be
blockbusters like "Speed Racer."
Everyone enjoys a
good smashup, though
it's not much fun if the
person you've run over
remains half-alive and
wedged through your
windshield. That's the
plot of "Stuck," the new
Mena Suvari thriller
opening Friday. Here are
five more movies, from
deadly dramas to goofy B-
flicks, that take a twisted delight
in twisted metal.

entertainingly.
