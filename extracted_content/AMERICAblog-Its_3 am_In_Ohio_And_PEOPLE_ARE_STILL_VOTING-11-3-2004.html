11/03/2004 03:19:00 AMYep, ABC News just reported at 3 in the morning that people are stilllined up and voting in at least TWO precincts in Ohio -- includingpredominantly college students at one polling area. With cell phonesand portable cameras, it's startling to me that we weren't seeing LIVEFOOTAGE of people lined up and voting in the most hotly contestedstate in the country, but there you are.Ohio is STILL casting ballots and there are provisional ballots ANDoverseas ballots AND absentee ballots. I am disconsolate at thismoment that it was even close, much less that Kerry is trailing in thepopular vote. But is it too much to ask that we count every vote or atleast wait until people have stopped voting in Ohio before calling it aday?Laughably, a Republican lackey just insisted that it was outrageousthat Kerry's people wanted to wait until all the votes were countedand claimed the Democrats were gonna try all sorts of legal wranglingand that the American people want their leaders chosen by votersand not by activist judges. Amen, brother, but where the hell wereyou in 2000?
