            <p>Reunionat 
Or, how to succeed in Hollywood 
by playing gay. 
THE NUMBER OF ACTORS who have launched 
. stellar careers with gay, lesbian, or trans gender roles is 
the best-kept secret in Hollywood. Now we know

the juicy queer parts for its students and, sure enough, turning 
their loser resumes into celebrity bios. The evidence: a program 
from a hush-hush Homo High reunion, excerpts from which 
are reprinted here, recalling graduates' yearbook entries and 
touting their subsequent successes. We hear another reunion is 
in the works, to honor James Duval, who recently went from 
Totally F**"ed Up to Independence Day.-MlcHAEL GILTZ
