Baseball behaving better 
Yankee Stadium is 
no better or worse 
than other sporting 
venues when it 
comes to fans using 
gay slurs-go to a 
game and you usual· 
ly hear people heck­
le an outfielder by 
saying he's Ua fag­
got" Or that he "goes 
both ways-men 
and boys." Go to a 
hockey or football 
game and you'lI.hear siml­
lartaunts. 
Stephen Cohen, a gov­
ernment employee in his 
mid 30s from Clifton, N.J., 
is a heavy-duty Yankees 
fan-who even frequents 
gay sports Web sites to 
talk about his paSSion-and 
also goes to games in hock­
ey, soccer, and other pro­
fessional sports with his 
partner of two years. Thus, 
he knows that hearing that 
kind of language Is the 
price you pay if you want to 
go to a sporting event. 
"Usually I'll just turn 
around and shake my 
head: he says. 
But Cohen's days of 
hearing perhaps the most YOUR 
~DDY11 
notable example of gay 
slurs at Yankee Stadium 
are coming to an end, In 
1996 the team began the 
tradition of playing the Vil­
lage People hit "YMCA" be­
tween the fifth and sixth 
innings. Shortly afterward, 
fans in the rowdy bleachers 
began the tradition of sin­
gling out a fan of the op­
posing team, surrounding 
them, and singing new 
lyrics; "Why are you gay? 
I saw you sucking that 
O+C-K: and so forth. 
That ribald tradition 
ended on June 14 during a 
game against Pittsburgh. 
This reporter was present 
In the stands when security 
officials and police offl-
www.advocate .com cers-who usually 
laughed along with the 
rest of the fans when 
the song was sung­
suddenly swooped in 
and escorted the peo­
ple leading the tune 
out of the stadiUm. 
New rules, the cops 
said. (Calls tothe Yan­
kee organization to 
clarify the "new rules" 
were not returned.) 
Fans complained 
loudly and bitterly. 'What Is 
this, a pollee state?" some 
asked. But after a few 
games they accepted It as 
the way things were. Gay 
fans have even noted an­
other positive side effect: 
Since the police clamped 
down on "Why Are You 
Gay: fans are much less 
likely to yell gay slurs at 
outfielders for fear of being 
ejected. 
Cohen, who can't get to 
many games at Yankee 
Stadium, is Just hearing 
about the new policy. 
'Wow," he says, 'Wow, If 
the Yankees did that, I 
would be very proud. And If 
they fead, other teams wHl 
fOllow." -MIchael Glitz
