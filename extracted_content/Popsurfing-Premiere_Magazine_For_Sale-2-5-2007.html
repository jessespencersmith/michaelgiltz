I can still rememberwhen the first issue of "Premiere" magazine came out -- it wasrevolutionary in covering the film indsutry seriously. Very few otherpublications did on-the-set pieces. Premiere did them all the time.Premiere launched the Power List, a ranking of everyone in Hollywoodby their amount of power. Brilliantly, it made PREMIERE powerfulsince everyone wanted to be on that list and higher than they were theyear before. Premiere also perfected the ranking of Summer and Fallmovies -- they used to give actual tough predictions, unafraid to saywhat looked like bombs, etc. Now EVERYONE has a Power List andeveryone ranks or previews summer movies. Premiere did great, meatyin-depth stories and while they weren't afraid of colorful personal lives,the focus was firmly on great artists making (or trying to make) greatfilms. They took movies seriously but still had fun. They've been socopied and beaten by the nimbler Entertainment Weekly, thatPremiere has faded in recent years. But it was extremely influential andit was the only place I wanted to work at when I first moved to NewYork and it gave me my first internship and job and byline so I willalways be fond of it.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
