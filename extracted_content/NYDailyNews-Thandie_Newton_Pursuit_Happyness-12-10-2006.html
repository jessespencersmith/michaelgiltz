Actress Thandie Newton says -half seriously -that 
she doesn't really know Will Smith, even though 
they both star in "The Pursuit of Happyness," the 
true story of a semi-homeless man who becomes a 
millionaire stockbroker that opens Friday. 
"To work opposite Will in this way, I knew 
it was special, even though part of me was 
pretty bummed out," says Newton about 
the drama that showcases a new side to the 
famously likable megastar. Smith's perfor­
mance as Chris Gardner is sober, subtle and 
was reportedly a labor of love. Newton co­
stars as Linda, the wife who abandons Gard­
ner -and their child, played by Smith's 
real-life son, Jaden Smith -when times are 
tough. Newton and Smith's scenes together 
are not the easiest things to watch. 
"How come I get to work with Will and 
we shout at each other every day?" Newton 
says, smiling. "I arrive on set and everyone 
is like, 'Oh, this is going to be so sad .... ' " 
It was that intensity that leads her feel she 
doesn't know her co-star as well as those 
who worked with him in action comedies or 
romantic comedies . 
.. At the end of the day, when we've been 
horrible to each other, it was very hard to 
then just be sweet and nice, because we had 
to channel so much s-to do it. We never 
got to know each other as who we are. He 
is Chris Gardner as far as I'm concerned . 
Will's a completely lovely guy, but I didn't 
get to know that. I sacrificed that in 
order to give him what he need-
ed. I really felt my job was to give 
Wlli and give the story what 
it needed. It had to be pretty 
rough. 
"That's my gift to it and to 
him, although I wish 1 could 
have been in 'Hitch!'" 
Elegant and funny, the 34-
year-old Newton is on a roll, 
th~ to "Happyness" and co­
starring in last year's Best Picture win-
ner, "Crash" (in which she had one of the 
most memorable scenes, when her charac­
rer was saved from a buming cal' wreck by 
a cop played by Matt Dillon). She docs have 
a lighter side (highlighted in two upcoming 
comedies. induding one with E:ddie M ur­
pby). and the British-born Newton is poised 
and poHle-except when given a bad cup of 
tea, as she receive' mid-interview, 
"Ooob, that is vile!" she laughs good­
naturedly . "Such awful tea'" 
Newton was worried people might have 
the same violent reaction to Linda in "Hap­
pyness," a mother who leaves behind her 
son with a man who ha~ no source of in­
come. She was (ietelIDine d to create "cracks where people can feel compassion, as op­
posed to judgment." 
Capturing the worn-down look of a 
woman working double shifts and facing a 
husband who can't feed himself, much less 
his family; was made easier by the fact that 
Newton is a mother herself (her daughters 
are now 6 and 2 years old). 
While making the movie, "I was al­
ready very, very thin, because I'd 
been nursing my child for 15 
months. And when 1 nurse, I lose 
weight, which is just me,". says 
Newton. "It was good to be 
looking kind of strung-out. No 
makeup, except for dark shad­
ows under my eyes. 1 didn't do 
anything with my hair. And I had 
a mean mouth." 
The result is that the glamorous 
star of "Mission: Impossible II" and 
"The Truth About Charlie" truly looks like 
a woman beaten down by life. Newton­
who came to attention in serious fare in­
cluding "Jefferson in Paris" and "Be­
loved" -was leery of doing press for the 
film, worried that everyone would see 
her character as "the bad guy." Yet the 
chance to work with Smith -even if they 
didn't get to bond -was simply too good to 
pass up. 
"Whatever he touches does turn to 
gold," says Newton. "So to be around 
him when he's stripping down that 'Will­
ness' we all know and love and expect and 
showing every dimension of this man, was 
wonderful." •</p>
