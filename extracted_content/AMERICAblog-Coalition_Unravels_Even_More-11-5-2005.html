11/05/2004 02:35:00 AMThe coalition of the not-so-willing continues to fall apart, withHungary the latest country to say, "You're on your own!" to theU.S. I suppose they were trying to be polite by not announcingthis before the elections, but it would have been nice if they'dlet the American people know BEFORE they voted that Hungarywas voting with its feet on Iraq and getting the hell out. Out of160,000 total coalition forces, 138,000 are U.S."Other nations that have recently announced withdrawalsinclude: Poland, with 2,350 troops; Italy, 3,000; theNetherlands, 1,300; Ukraine, 1,450, Norway, 300; NewZealand, 61; and Thailand, 880," reports USA Today."Previously, Spain, the Dominican Republic, Honduras,Nicaragua, the Philippines, the Czech Republic, Kazakhstan andEl Salvador withdrew forces. New contributors to the force areSouth Korea and Tonga."I'd take pleasure in knowing Bush has to deal with this insteadof Kerry, but our young men and women are dying in Iraq andwe desperately need MORE TROOPS. Bush insists the generalshaven't asked for any, but they know they're not supposed toor their career is over so what a surprise that they don't.Meanwhile, any fool knows we need more troops to defendthose ammo depots, pretend to defend the leaky borders andstart attacking the insurgents.
