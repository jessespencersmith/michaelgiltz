            <p>Yet Again 
Broadway is cummtly giving the people what they want in the 
fonn of lavish, lumbering shows that take years to mount 
but rarely attempt to stretch the boundaries of musical the· 
ater. Happily, one of the theater's most promising talents, compos· 
er Michael John LaChuisa, manages to be both prolific and 
consistently surprising-if consistently Off Broadway. In the past 
fourteen months alone, he's mounted three shows. First Lady Suite 
was a musical·theater piece that focused on three presidential 
wives; Hello Again, based on Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde, linked a 
musical daisy chain of lovers. Now he returns to the Public with 71Je 
Petrified Prince, a ribald tale based on an Ingmar Bergman script 
and directed by Harold Prince. "It's a vel)' simple stOI)'," explains 
LaChuisa. "A mythical European kingdom, Slavonia, 
is ruled by a queen, Katarina, who had been a 
whore. Her husband, the king, dies of a heart 
attack, and her son is set to inherit the crown. 
However, her son is a complete catatonic, a real emotional wreck because his mother is such a hor· 
rible human being." Writing for an imperious character like the queen was a breeze. "I love Katari· 
na," LaChuisa says. "She's a cross between Leona Helmsleyand Nancy Reagan." Also in the works 
is another opera librett.-.a welcome source of cash, but hardly his favorite medium. "Most opera 
houses have this ridiculous working schedule," he says. "You meet with the director once. Two years 
later, you meet with the director again and that's the week of dress rehearsals. When I go to an opera house, I feel like 
saying, 'Please treat me as if I were dead.' You get much more respect" MICHAEL GILlZ</p>
