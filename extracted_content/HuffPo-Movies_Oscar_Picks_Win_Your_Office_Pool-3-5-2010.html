 28Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyOscar Picks: Win Your Office Pool!
What's Your Reaction:
Read More:  Academy Awards  , Avatar  , Inglorious Basterds  , Kathryn Bigelow  , Oscar  , Quentin Tarantino
, The Hurt Locker  , Up In The Air  , Entertainment News
RESULTS: In one of the easiest years to predict in
memory, I only got 17 out of 24. I blew it on the
smaller categories where you have to shine, like the
live action and animated and documentary shortswhere I only got 1 out of 3 right. Oh well, there's
always next year.
Ok, I won't  guarantee that you'll win your office pool.
My track record is spotty -- especially during years
when I passionately love a movie. (Never bet on your
favorite team; you never bet smart.) But I've spoken to friends in Hollywood who attend the screenings,
studied the tea leaves and here are my picks for the winners, along with info on close races if you want to
ignore my advice.
And when people tell you, "But it's been 60 years since a movie grossed so little money and won Best
Picture" or "no movie that has been nominated for Best Director AND won Best Editing has ever...." Yep,
all those trends are good to note. But Academy voters don't vote that way. They (or their sister or theirassistant) vote spontaneously from their heart. Assuming they themselves aren't on the ballot.
So here's my ballot followed by my explanations where necessary and the favorite choice among other
voters. Good luck!
BEST PICTURE  The Hurt Locker  YES!
BEST DIRECTOR  Katheryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker  YES!
BEST ACTOR  -- Jeff Bridges for  Crazy Heart  YES!
BEST ACTRESS  -- Sandra Bullock for The Blind Side  YES!
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR  -- Christoph Waltz for Inglorious Basterds  YES!
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS  -- Mo'Nique for Precious  YES!
BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY  -- Inglorious Basterds  NO.
BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY  -- Up In The Air  NO.
BEST ANIMATED FEATURE  -- Up  YES!

<p>BEST FOREIGN FILM  -- El Secreto De Sus Ojos  YES!
BEST DOCUMENTARY  -- The Cove  YES!
BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT  -- Music By Prudence  YES!
BEST LIVE ACTION SHORT  -- Instead of Abracadabra  NO.
BEST ANIMATED SHORT  -- A Matter Of Loaf And Death  NO.
BEST SCORE  -- Up  YES!
BEST SONG  -- "The Weary Kind" from Crazy Heart  YES!
BEST SOUND EDITING/SOUND MIXING/ART DIRECTION  -- Avatar  NO. NO. YES!
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY  -- The White Ribbon.  NO.
BEST MAKEUP  -- Star Trek YES!
BEST COSTUME DESIGN  -- The Young Victoria  YES!
BEST FILM EDITING -- The Hurt Locker  YES!
BEST VISUAL EFFECTS  -- Avatar  YES!
BEST PICTURE  The Hurt Locker  (runner-up Avatar  or could it be Inglorious Basterds  or Up In The
Air? ) -- I'm the only one who thinks Up In The Air  still has a shot but with this new ranking system
where voters list all 10 movies in preference, anything goes. And whichever movie wins, people will point
to that new voting twist rather than the simple fact that The Hurt Locker  or Avatar  or whatever was the
most popular film among voters. Why do I pick Up In The Air  as the dark horse? It plays very well on TV
(where many voters watch the nominees), it's a film in the classic Hollywood style a la Billy Wilder and
thus appeals to older voters, it stars an honest to goodness movie star and it was a strong hit (unlike
Locker ). Most importantly, the people who love Hurt  will probably list Avatar  last while those rooting for
Avatar  will list Hurt Locker  last. And what will be second or third on all of their ballots? I'm betting it's
Up In The Air  and Inglorious Basterds.  I don't love Hurt  (it's quite good and very well directed) so I'm
not passionate about this category. But since Oscar loves to frustrate me, the most annoying win would
be Avatar  and therefore that might just pull it off.
BEST DIRECTOR  Katheryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker. Long overdue for the gender, of course and
Bigelow has come into her own.
BEST ACTOR  -- Jeff Bridges for  Crazy Heart.  A career award, yes, but also a very good performance.
BEST ACTRESS  -- Sandra Bullock for The Blind Side.  The only acting category that's a close call. Meryl
Streep is the dark horse here; if only her movie were better. Bullock had a career year thanks to The
Proposal  and then this wildly popular smash hit that she carried with some of her best acting yet. Not a
great movie, but obviously they love it. (Best Picture nomination, anyone?) It's her year.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR  -- Christoph Waltz for Inglorious Basterds .
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS  -- Mo'Nique for Precious .
BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY  -- Inglorious Basterds  by Quentin Tarantino. Hollywood loved the
film (it won the SAG for Best Ensemble), it was the biggest hit of his career and this is their best chance
to reward him, assuming it doesn't swoop in and win Best Picture. The Hurt Locker  could contend but
that movie was all about the direction.
BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY  -- Up In The Air  by Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner. A model of
adaptation, especially if you read the very different book by Walter Kirn. (By the way, notice how I name
the movie first and then the people? I wish the Academy Awards would do this instead of naming people
we've never heard of before finally telling us it was, say, Avatar  that won Special Effects or whatever.)
BEST ANIMATED FEATURE  -- Up  by Pixar, of course. They should have won Best Picture by now
and some day they will.
BEST FOREIGN FILM  -- El Secreto De Sus Ojos.  The White Ribbon  has won everything and Un
Prophete was my favorite film of 2009, bar none. But this category is always a crazy wild card. I'm
picking this film because of its heart, whereas White Ribbon  is cold and austere. But most people pick
White  so if you want to be conservative go with that.
BEST DOCUMENTARY  -- The Cove.  Food Inc  also pushes the buttons the Academy loves and The
Most Dangerous Man in America  is liberal and has a Jewish angle but The Cove  is about lovable
dolphins being slaughtered and is moving them to tears.BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT  -- Music By Prudence.  I have NOT seen these shorts (I have in the
other categories) so this is based solely on the subject matter. Heart-tuggers and anything on the

<p>Holocaust usually triumph. China's Unnatural Disaster: The Tears Of Sichuan Province  is about the
shoddy school buildings in China that collapsed after an earthquake and killed so many children. It's
painful. Music By Prudence  also deals with adversity but with a far more upbeat way since it's about a
deformed child cast out by her society but protected by her mother and ultimately proving to have a
lovely, haunting singing voice that has been her salvation. See? You're tearing up already. (I'm not beingflippant about the actual issues addressed in these films, just the way Academy voters respond to them.)
BEST LIVE ACTION SHORT  -- Instead of Abracadabra.  By far the best short of the five, and it's fun
and sweet with a great kicker (ie. closing gag) to boot. The others are mostly grim. The New Tenants  has
some well-known actors (always a good pull with voters), but has awkward shifts in tone and ends
poorly. Nonetheless, friends report it has played well at screenings. Still, my money is on Abracadabra .
BEST ANIMATED SHORT  -- A Matter Of Loaf And Death . Nick Park of Wallace & Gromit owns this
category and that isn't changing this year. French Roast  is very mild. Granny O'Grimm's Sleeping Beauty
is very well-animated but has one joke and no ending. The Lady And The Reaper  is not bad but also has
a weak kicker that spoils the modest fun. Logorama  is the only contender: it has a great visual look that
employs logos for an entire world, not to mention advertising characters like the Michelin Man as cops,Mr. Clean as a gay tour guide and so on. Two negatives: it's not funny when EVERY character is foul-mouthed and the short is too long and goes completely off the rails with a very confusing ending. Still, ithas a cool factor and could upset. But stick with Wallace & Gromit. (Note: make sure you check out David
Wallechinsky's post  for more on the animated shorts, including clips and complete entries available for
viewing. Then you can make up your own mind and tell me how crazy I am!)
BEST SCORE  -- Up  by Michael Giacchino. You can take it to the bank. He's won every award in sight
and it's a glorious work that tips a hat to classic Hollywood film scores. And it's from a movie everyone
loves.
BEST SONG  -- "The Weary Kind" from Crazy Heart  by Ryan Bingham and T-Bone Burnett. Another
sure shot. Bet your house on it.BEST SOUND EDITING/SOUND MIXING/ART DIRECTION  -- Avatar  in a technical categories
sweep.
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY  -- The White Ribbon.  Why would this win Best Cinematography but
White Ribbon  not win Best Foreign Film? Because everyone can vote in this category while you have to
prove you saw all five foreign films to vote for that one. The White Ribbon  is in black and white (which
Hollywood is a sucker for), it won the guild award and it looks absolutely stunning. Still, this is a toss-up.
Avatar  or The Hurt Locker  could triumph. Personally, I'd root for Inglorious Basterds  and the great
work of Robert Richardson. If he wins, that might mean an upset in Best Picture.
BEST MAKEUP  -- Star Trek  by Barry Burman, Mindy Hall and Joe Harlow.
BEST COSTUME DESIGN  -- The Young Victoria  by Sandy Powell.
BEST FILM EDITING -- The Hurt Locker  by Chris Innis and Bob Murawski. They won the guild award
for this category so other editors love it the most. I'd vote for Sally Menke and her great, great work on
Inglorious Basterds and if it wins that could be another sign of an upset. Obviously Avatar  is also a
factor here.
BEST VISUAL EFFECTS  -- Avatar  by Joe Letteri, Stephen Rosenbaum, Richard Baneham and
Andrew R. Jones. I'd give it to District 9,  which did the most with the least (and beat out 2012  to get
nominated) and my favorite of the three is Star Trek  but Avatar  it is. Without a doubt.

 FollowYou're absolutely right. Not having a dog in the fight helps a lot. You should also never bet
on your college sports team: emotion always trumps logic. Hence my inability to accept thatAvatar could win Best Picture.
I rented Dist.9 (not my ilk in genre..but curiosity got the best of me)..and while the "team" deniesit...I kept wondering (which IS a good sign)..the re MUST be a sequel..3 years...th e promise... and,
maybe because it was made in S. Africa...v ery political. ..uber day aparteide (sp?)... the whole
Avartar thing just doesn't interest me (forget that I HATED Titanic).. I guess fantasy ..not my
fav..altho ugh I have to say..I didn't see Lord of the Rings in theater..( again..did n't interest me)..and
today..the Two towers is one of my favorite movies ever..so this old dog (me) CAN learn new tricks..I can't wait until White Ribbon is on DVD...I'm guessing it may effect me like The Boy in theStripped Pajamas (one of THEEE most powerful movies I've EVER EVER seen...).. .didn't it win last
year or before for best foreign?Love Jeff Bridges... always have..alwa ys will
A sequel to District 9 is certain to happen. The filmmaker and talent want to see it happenand probably won't be demanding so much money that they'd make it impossible . And the
film was a huge success. It could be a prequel or a sequel or they might do both and makeit a trilogy. Glad to hear you're open to new things like sci-fi and fantasy movies that get alot of praise. Two Towers is definitely a corker and the trilogy as a whole one of the majoraccomplish ments of the decade. The Boy In The Striped Pajamas was not nominated for
Best Foreign Film (which is a very complicate d country by country process) nor any other
Oscars.
I sometimes think it's easier to predict the winners if you haven't seen any of the nominees, as thereare so many additional factors affecting the voting. There certainly see to be some simple tips to
winning an Oscar - I've been checking them out here: bit.ly/9GP AIQ
I gotta go with Hurt Locker.
There was a bit of the Lone Ranger and Tanto dynamic with the lead and supporting actors, but it's
a solid movie.
Well, I'm finishing watching The Hurt Locker and the suicide bomber scene really won me over. I'd
say yeah, this is the best picture.Permalink  | Share it

88 FansOk, I've seen Inglorious Basterds, and I have to say, it had its moments and also it's moments
lacking in something. .. 
I'm most of the way through The Hurt Locker, and the male-bondi ng aspect of it is pretty rancid. 
I haven't yet seen the movie about the blue aliens, but I vote it.
Balzac...I 've not seen IB yet..but question.. do you think Quenton has unsolved anger
issues? (seriously )...I mean.. Sam Peckenpah had a pretty high body count in his
movies..bu t there was substance. ..n'est pas?
My personal favorite Avatar..A movie you want to see again just for the effects.Ne ver saw anything
like it before.... ...Do hope Up gets something as it was a very good film..
The anti-Ameri can movie "Avatar" had very cool special effects, but the liberalism throughout made
it tough to enjoy.
My son is a Sci-Fi fan. He made me watch District 9. While he can be political, a goodmovie to him is a good movie. For instance, Old Boy is one of his favorite movies. Wasthere a political undertone to that? No. Sometimes a movie is just a movie. In the 30'S and40's, movies were escapism from WWII.
He didn't see political messages in that film. He saw no undertones in Avatar. He just saw
a good Sci-Fi movie. 
Lighten up, enjoy a film for what it is. Watch Julie and Julia. Watch Nine. Watch Up In The
Air. Those are character driven movies. 
Heh, I find it amusing when Liberal (or in your case, liberalism ) is used as a dirty word. If
this is indeed America, Land of the Free, we're free to be Liberal and you have to live with
it. Maybe you and Kirk Cameron can start your own production company to put out the
movies you prefer to see. Meanwhile, you can ignore what's going on in the rest of the
world and the movies they produce to illustrate it.
Liberalism ? So indiscrimi nately destroying nature while stealing land and resources from the
people who live there are not bad things to do (as those pesky Liberals claim) but are
actually considered good things to do from the Conservati ve viewpoint?

20 Fansmade it a Conservati ve movie instead?
Yes, one has to wonder, is Dances With Wolves a liberal movie? It surely is as
Kevin Costner rides off with his Indian bride so the "white man" won't badger therest of the tribe. 
I dare say, Conservati sm is the whole reason Oklahoma exists. Oddly enough,
American Indians are fairly conservati ve...just look at Ok's reps and senators. Yet,
they do get a good healthcare plan through their respected nations which comes
from the government .
For me, I think it should be either Inglorious Basterds or Hurt Locker. I enjoyed them both. I haven'tseen Avatar, that's not really my favorite genre (I did see District 9, which I thought was outstanding) I just watched Up in the Air yesterday, and while it was a good flick, it was average. Preciouswas a good movie, but oh my goodness, the story was bleak and painful to watch.
I love a good foreign film, so I'll be hunting the other nominees down soon. I did see The White
Ribbon and enjoyed it, although the editing to me was at times a little disjointed and confusing. 
If Christoph Waltz doesn't win for Best Supporting Actor, the voting was rigged. I think Mo'Nique
should win her category as well. She killed in that roll!
Best Horror Show:
Health Care Reform Debate
I've seen none of the nominees. I'd rather watch a good planet earth nature show. Sorry :)
Well, then I hope you've watched "The Blue Planet" and "Planet Earth" on DVD (especiall y
BluRay). They really are head and shoulders above most nature programmin g I've ever
seen. Great stuff. Wiki entry: http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/T he_Blue_Pl anet

I love "The Blue Planet (Seas of Life)" but, unlike "Planet Earth", I don't think it's on
Blu-ray hi-def yet (which is practicall y a crime!), so it's just on DVD.
And every David Attenborou gh nature documentar y is an absolute must-see! (
http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/D avid_Atten borough#Fi lmography  ). The high-quali ty is
consistent across all of them.

And if you like nature shows, why not check out The Cove, nominated for Best Documentary? It's a good (not great) film about dolphins and the people striving to protect them fromillegal slaughter in Japan. Not a pure nature film but should appeal to anyone interested innature and animals.
I haven't even seen most of the nominees.
Well, there are certainly some worthy ones. Up in The Air, Up, Inglorious basterds and ASerious Man are all on my best of the year list and District 9 is good fun. That's a drama,an art film, a war movie, an animated film and an art house movie. So hopefully one ofthem should be the sort of movie you like and worth a look.
