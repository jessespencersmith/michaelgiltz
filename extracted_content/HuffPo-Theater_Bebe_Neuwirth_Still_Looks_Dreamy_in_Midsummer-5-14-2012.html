 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: Bebe Neuwirth Still Looks
Dreamy in "Midsummer"
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM  ** 1/2 out of
****
CLASSIC STAGE COMPANY
The Classic Stage Company's production of
Shakespeare's bauble A Midsummer Night's Dream  has
an eye-catching set and an eye-catching cast in various
stages of undress. If you've ever wanted to see an Abercrombie & Fitch model recite verse in theirunderwear (and who hasn't?), this is the show for you. Run and catch it before it closes on May 20. Butthe visage you're most likely to remember is that of the lithe and self-assured Bebe Neuwirth,
commanding both physically and theatrically in dual roles as the fairy queen Titania and the slightly
morose Hippolyta. She moves with grace and speaks her lines with authority, matched moment to
moment by Anthony Heald's Oberon/Theseus (a very lucky man, indeed).
I'd say Neuwirth is sexy despite the costumes of Andrea Lauer. Shakespeare's tale of young lovers put at
cross purposes by a mischief-making Puck (an over-exuberant Taylor Mac) is certainly one that
encourages a free spirit in all areas. But her costumes are a little broad and jokey for my taste, even in
this context. Still, Neuwirth looks wonderful, even in a silly leather dominatrix outfit.
I certainly won't fault Lauer for stripping the lovers down to their smalls. It's a good way of distracting us
from the fact that Christina Ricci, Nick Gehlfuss, Jordan Dean and Halley Wegryn Gross are all more
confident cavorting about than turning the verse of Shakespeare into natural-seeming dialogue.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>That's presumably why director Tony Speciale has them bouncing about and wrestling and tackling and
tumbling over one another throughout the long night where lover after lover is bewitched into switching
their passion. Equally broad are the rude mechanicals, the local buffoons led by Nick Bottom (Steven
Skybell) who simply want to rehearse their woebegone play in the woods, only to have Bottom turned
into an ass and become the paramour of Titania.
This is not a production for insight but it is handsomely mounted. The set design by Mark Wendland is
especially striking. It features a wall of mirrors tilting gently over the stage and beautiful touches like a
shower of flower petals that also became amusingly bounteous at one point. The lighting and sound by
Tyler Micoleau and M. Florian Staab worked together seamlessly to create the pastoral magic this workcalls for.
A special round of applause for the music of Christian Frederickson and Ryan Rumery. Songs are
peppered throughout the play and I've rarely heard them given such beautiful musical settings or sung so
well as they are here. (On a similar note, Jordan Dean has a very amusing running gag as Demetrius
where he delivers some of his lines in a quavering, r&b crooner style; a goofily funny touch that wasn't
overdone.) When it sings, this Midsummer  soars, but even at its most earth-bound it's an amiable night
of theater.

I agree! They didn't post any video with Neuwirth in it so I had none to share, I'm afraid.
