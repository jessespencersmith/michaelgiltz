THE MCKITTRICK HOTEL
Punchdrunk  is a theater company that specializes in
"immersive" theater in which the audiences wanders in
and throughout spaces, interacting with the cast to onedegree or another and having a unique experience oftenquite different from the people they attend the showwith. They're currently performing Sleep No More , a
spin on Shakespeare's Macbeth  that is one of the most
entertaining and involving works of theater you're likely
to see. Here's the artistic director of ART waxing enthusiastic about their work.

<p>It's easy to just treat what they do as an event, as some sort of "experience" and leave it at that. While
Sleep No More  may be unusual and hard to classify, it is also most assuredly theater of the highest order.
You enter the space, don a mask that's very Eyes Wide Shut , are enjoined not to speak a word and then
spend several hours wandering through four or five floors of an abandoned warehouse, each floor filledwith rooms that are bursting with specific and fascinating detail -- from a detective's office to a sweetsshop to a graveyard and a banquet hall. Everywhere you go you'll spot people trailing this or that actor.Once you latch onto Macbeth or Lady Macbeth, friends suggested you follow them for a while until youfeel the scenes repeating or just want to move on. That's what I did, following Lady Macbeth for about 45minutes. At several points she stood inches from my face, peering into my eyes with a distracted, hauntedlook. Seeing hordes of masked people dog her every step, literally haunting her as she ran down a
hallway must provide a thrilling energy to the cast and made this show intriguing to watch. Beyond a few
whispered lines about "blood" and "damned spots," you don't hear much dialogue from her or anyone.
Then I started trailing Macbeth. When I felt the storylines crossing again (the basic plot seems to repeat
two or three times), I began to stalk one of the secondary actors, a handsome fellow who danced amarvelous solo piece before being put into a sleep by one of the witches. Then I purposely stepped awayfrom the "action" and just wandered into this and that room, opening drawers and peering into ledgers. Istumbled upon one actor stitching up a teddy bear and at another moment a woman grabbed one of theaudience members and pulled him into her bedroom, shutting the rest of us out. Just when I felt I'd seeneverything, an entirely new level of rooms and scenes opened up in front of me. One nursery tucked away
into a corner (my guest never even saw it) was so haunting and beautifully done (headless and limbless
dolls sprayed up from an empty battered crib) that I wouldn't have been surprised to see an identicalinstallation at the Whitney Biennial. It's that good and this sort of attention to detail continuesthroughout.
I'm making it sound like some sort of hipster interactive theater, but that's far from the mark. Time and
again, I was blown away by some stunning scene: a banquet dinner with the cast moving in slow motionand set to overwhelming music and hypnotic lighting was thrilling, as was a dance scene and what mighthave been a rave or the witches' prophecies. The choreography, the sound design (which includes musicfrom films by Alfred Hitchcock among other sources), the sets, the lighting are all wonderfully realized. Ican't even single out individual castmembers since I rarely knew who was playing whom. Certainly afamiliarity with Macbeth  helps but it may not even be essential. It's not handicapped friendly and if
you're not spry, this may not be for you. A LOT of stair-climbing is involved. But if you have any sense of
adventure, this is theater you don't want to miss.
EVANS HAILE: SALON SOIREE  ***
ETC. ETC.Evans Haile is a theatrical impresario and performer who has performed all over the world. He's perhaps
best known for being the Artistic Director of the Cape Playhouse , America's oldest professional summer
theater; his acclaimed recordings of 50 Million Frenchmen, Magdalena  and Babes In Arms,  among
others; and the late, lamented series of NPR specials he hosted called Toast Of The Town that centered onBroadway and the theater world.
His current one-man show is typical of Haile, combining personal memories with casually informative
anecdotes. A memory of watching Ingrid Bergman in Intermezzo  leads into a performance of Christian
Sinding's "Rustle Of Spring." A story about playing music with -- not "for" mind you, but with  --
Gorbachev heralds a dive into Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody #10."

<p>How to describe the lost art he displays of informed comments sprinkled with wry jokes and asides about
polo season in Camden mixed with assured and sparkling renditions of everything from Gottschalk andLecuona (the Cuban Gershwin) to Debussy and Strauss? If Liberace were witty and sophisticated ratherthan campy and silly, you might wind up with Haile, a performer never afraid of showmanship but withenough style to keep excess in check.
