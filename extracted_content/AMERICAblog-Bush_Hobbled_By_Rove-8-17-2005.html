8/17/2005 07:26:00 PMA depressing but accurate story in Rolling Stone details thatwhile Bush was seemingly hobbled by Karl Rove, bombings inLondon and the endless blood-letting in Iraq, Bush was alsoscoring victory after victory on Capitol Hill. Among histriumphs: that pork-packed energy bill, that equally filled-with-fat highway bill, the passing of CAFTA and the renewal ofthe Patriot Act with almost all of it intact and now permanent.The Dems big victory? Not getting in the way when Bushimploded with his dangerous and unpopular desire to destroySocial Security. Some lame duck.
