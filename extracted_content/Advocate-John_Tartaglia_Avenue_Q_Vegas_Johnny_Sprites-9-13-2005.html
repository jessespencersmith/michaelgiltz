THE SCENES 
AvenueQ's 
under construction 
Apparently, Avenue Q is the road to 
success. John Tartaglia-one ofthe 
stars ofthat Tony-winning Broadway 
musical-heads to Las Vegas for its 
much-anticipated bow in September . 
"I've actually never been there," says 
Tartaglia, who has won audiences over 
with his winning portrayal of puppets 
Princeton and closeted Republican Rod 
in the hilarious show, still doing block­
buster business in New York City. 
Tartaglia will make an even bigger 
bow when Johnny and the Sprites-a 
kids' show he created and stars in­
begins airing on the Disney Channel in 
October. 
"It's very musical, very funny. My 
character is named Johnny, so it's a big 
leap for me," laughs Tartaglia. "I'm a 
singer-songwriter who moves to this 
place in the woods and meets all these 
fantasy characters. It's right where the 
real world meets the fantasy world." 
Look for tunes by Broadway legend 
Stephen Schwartz (who wrote the 
theme song) as well as Gary Adler and 
Michael Patrick Walker (the talent 
behind the off-Broadway hit Altar Boyz) 
and others. With Johnny and the 
Sprites, Tartaglia becomes perhaps 
the first openly gay artist ever to star 
in a TV show geared to kids. The 
initial airings will be in the form of 
"interstitials"-three- and four-minute 
segments-and if all goes well, half­
hour episodes will start shooting in 
the spring. 
"I was asked to create something, 
and I wanted to deal with differences 
and emotional development :' says 
Tartaglia. "A lot of kids' shows are 
about letters and numbers and colors, 
but they're not preparing kids to deal 
with the world. I wanted to celebrate 
who we are and the things that make 
us unique and the things that we share 
together." -Michael GUtz
