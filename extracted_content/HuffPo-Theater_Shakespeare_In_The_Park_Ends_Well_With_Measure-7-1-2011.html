 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Shakespeare In The Park
"Ends Well" With "Measure"
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL  **
MEASURE FOR MEASURE  ***
SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK
Shakespeare in the Park  has experimented the last few
seasons with performing plays in repertory with the
same cast. It's proven a very strong success. With bothshows alternating you can catch two differentproductions in a week. With the same general cast, youhave the fun of seeing actor after actor tackle radicallydifferent roles or give a subtle spin to similar characters.The longer timespan may also have kept the biggestnames from committing which might also be a goodthing. Star-heavy casting sometimes tilts the shows
towards those names. This summer you genuinely have a sense of a company coming together to present
these shows. Here's hoping they continue with this approach. If the Public Theater  is our de facto
national theater, then for a few weeks in the summer we get to see what it would be like to have an
ongoing theater company a la the RSC in London. Here's a video chat with some of the male castmembers.

<p>Both plays are romantic dramas, rather serious in their way but filled with entertainment. They work
wonderfully with the outdoor setting -- as darkness creeps in, the shows themselves get more and moreweighty. In general, they are both acted quite well. All's Well That Ends Well  is rather poorly directed by
Daniel Sullivan, who enjoyed a great season on Broadway with The Merchant Of Venice  and Good People.
The set is dominated by a large, imposing balcony running across the stage with staircases leading down.He makes almost nothing of it, turning this large structure into a major distraction. Both shows arerather slowly paced and keep the text basically intact, though All's Well  is the one that feels more draggy.
It didn't help All's Well  that I just saw an absolutely marvelous, definitive production at London's Globe
Theatre. It's considered a "problem" play because our heroine Helena (Annie Parisse) yearns for Bertram
(the talented Andre Holland) who is - how to put this? -- a jerk. The more we admire her, the more wewonder what she sees in him. The London production decided there was no problem and presentedBertram with his warts and all. Love isn't logical, after all. Plus, they emphasized his youthfulimpetuosity. He may behave like a cad from scene to scene, but at least we know he believes in his ownpassions -- however much they may be the opposite of what he swore to believe a minute ago -- down to
his core. Not so here, where Bertram is more typically calculating.
John Cullum and Tonya Pinkins are strong in their significant roles as the mother of Bertram and the
King Of France, especially when Cullum gets to drop the hammer on Bertram. It gets a little lively at theend, when all the couples are intertwined for good (whether they like it or not), but the show takes toolong to get there.
And look at Reg Rogers. He plays a cowardly friend of Bertram's called Parolles. Comic relief, Parolles
came to life in London as a real person, not just a fop to make sport of. That made his humor funnier andhis comeuppance more painful. Here, Rogers is just a fool. But in Measure for Measure , he plays Lucio
with more subtlety, getting more laughs and creating a genuine man in the process. it's typical of director
David Esbjornson's more thoughtful work in Measure .
The show begins with demons prowling the stage (our inner id or at least our fear of sexual desire made
manifest). They prompt the Duke (Lorenzo Pisoni) to high it out of town and put his confidant Angelo(Michael Hayden) in charge. The Duke wants to see how Angelo with perform and expects a man of suchsober character can clamp down on vice more convincingly. And how. Angelo outlaws all fornicationoutside of marriage, which soon means he must execute a fine young man Claudio (Holland again) whohas impregnated his fiance. Claudio begs his sister Isabella (Danai Gurira) to plead for mercy fromAngelo. To his shock, Angelo finds himself deeply, furiously desirous of Isabella and says he will spareher brother's life if she gives up her maidenhood to him. Oh the villainy! The show has a vague rock and
roll feel, with punkish, comically sexual costumes by Elizabeth Hope Clancy, a memorable music and
sound score by John Gromada (aided by Acme Sound Partners strong sound design) and even endingwith the Rolling Stones performing "Sympathy For The Devil" (a bit of a stretch, that one).
The exceptional Dakin Matthews does his usual yeoman's work in dual roles. Carson Elrod has fun
playing a male prostitute, Pompey, wandering through the crowd and teasing the audience during onescene, offering his services to a hulking executioner in another. David Manis -- just like Rogers -- createsa more believable dullard (and therefore a funnier role) in Measure  than he did in All's Well.
Pisoni is a very unmemorable Duke; it's almost a surprise at the end to realize this is his play. He deliversthe poetry and music of Shakespeare, rather than the meaning -- always a fatal mistake. He's not bad,just not nearly as good as his two main costars in Measure. Just as the actress Annie Parisse did

And...marvelous work in All's Well  as Helena, Measure  is dominated by Isabella. It makes sense that a star
would be born out of doors and that surely seems true here for Danai Gurira. She shows a fierce
intelligence and commitment to her part that makes this show come alive whenever she is onstage.Gurira has been on Broadway in Joe Turner's Come and Gone,  had a small role in TV's Treme  and other
parts here and there but truly flowers here.
She is matched line for line by Michael Hayden as the corrupt Angelo. Their scenes together when they
spar for the life of Claudio and the soul of Isabella are electric and worth waiting online all day for. That's
why people return again and again to Shakespeare in the Park  -- free theater, fine casts, a convivial
audience, sometimes great productions that become the talk of the season, and once in a while a chanceto see a new talent flourish.
