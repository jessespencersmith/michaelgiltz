            <p>The Hitchhiker's Guide 
To The Galaxy **1/2 
(Touchstone; $29.99) 
Go into the future for a giggle 
with this sci-fi comedy that 
begins with the end of the 
world and does a pretty good 
job of capturing the anarchic -
Fingersmith ***1)% (Acorn; $29.99) 
This smashingly fun UK. 
miniseries is almost certainly 
the best Sapphic Dickensian 
melodrama we will ever see, 
telling a tale of con artistry and 
lesbian love based on the best­
selling novel by Sarah Waters. 
Other TV just out: the Emmy­
nominated miniseries "Empire 
Falls" (HBO; $29.98) from the 
Pulitzer Prize winner by 
Richard Russo; the hilarious 
hip-hop interview spoof "Da 
Ali G Show: Da Compleet " 
Second Seazon" (HBO; $29.95); 
and the final season of the 
legendary Second City sketch 
comedy show with John Candy, 
Eugene Levy, et aI., "SCTV 
Volume 4" (Shout; $89.98). 
. Ben-Hur 
***1/2 (Warner Bros.; $39.92) 
Today, big, lumbering epics like spirit of the comedic novel by 
Douglas Adams. Martin 
Freeman is perfectly cast as the 
helpless hero, Arthur. Dent, 
though the usually engaging 
Mos Def is disappointingly 
subdued as alien writer "Ford 
Prefect. Witty extras include 
deleted scenes,fake deleted 
scenes, two commentaries and 
a sing-along, 
"Troy" and "Alexander" are 
reason to flee the theater. But 
in the golden era of Hollywood, 
big, lumbering epics like 1959's 
l!-time Oscar winner "Ben-Hur 
Collector's Edition" managed 
to remain intelligent and 
engaging -thanks to director 
William Wyler and the stolid 
Charlton Heston. Extras are 
beyond lavish, not least of 
which is the complete 1925 
silent version, two substantial 
documentaries and much more. 
Also out: the near-miss of 
1983's "Rumble Fish Special 
Edition" (Universal; $19.98) and 
the triumphant 1980 Loretta 
Lynn bio-pic "Coal Miner's 
Daughter 25th Anniversary 
Edition" (Universal; $19.98). 
Director's Label Series 
Vol. 2 
***1/2 (Palm; $79.98) 
This new boxed set collects 
the work of four 
groundbreaking music video 
directors, each of which is 
available for $24.98. It makes 
clear these short films aren't 
just launching pads for young 
talent or promos for rock stars, 
but fascinating, brilliant works 
of art. Artists featured with 
roughly a dozen works each 
include Anton Corbijn (U2's 
"One"), Mark Romanek 
(Johnny Cash's "Hurt"), 
Jonathan Glazer (Radiohead's 
"Karma Police") and Stephane 
Sednaoui (Bjork's "Big Time 
Sensuality"). til c:
