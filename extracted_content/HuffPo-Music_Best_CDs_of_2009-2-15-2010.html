The Best CDs of 2009
1. The Avett Brothers  I And Love And You (Americana)/ Regina Spektor  Far (quirky pop via Russian
kitsch) -- Both of these acts have been garnering acclaim for a few albums. What I love here is how they
both reach out to a wider audience without sacrificing the qualities that make them special. They'reswinging for the fences -- and connecting, whether it's Spektor with her heart-stopping tune of faith on"Laughing With" or the Avett Brothers with that instant classic title track. And both are even better in
concert. Two major talents who continue to blossom.
2. Ella Fitzgerald  Twelve Nights In Hollywood  (swinging jazz vocalese) -- Is Ella the greatest jazz
singer of all time? This set puts her over the top in my book. Billie Holiday dealt with a lot of weak
material early in her career and a weak voice late in her career. Dinah Washington was just as prolific inher way but always more of a force live than in the studio. Carmen McRae always swung it hard but
never soft, Sarah Vaughan was like a delicious liqueur -- fine in small doses. But who can match Ella
both for her recorded output and her live performances? Obviously, her Songbook albums are hermasterpiece and indeed one of the masterpieces of popular music, along with Sinatra's concept albumsfor Capitol. But to hear these four CDs worth of music unearthed after so many decades is a revelation.
Ella starts off at a gallop with "Lover Come Back To Me" and never lets up. Funny, charming,
heartbreaking, joyful, scatting with ease, swinging with delight, Ella takes your breath away again andagain. It's stunning. Just try and listen to it without smiling.
3. Maxwell  BLACKsummers'night  (Seventies soul)- Maxwell pulled a Sade and just like her, he returned
to the spotlight after many years off without missing a beat. For young artists trying to stay current, that
can seem impossible. For a classic talent like Maxwell, it's easy. Music like this concept album about a

<p>romance is simply timeless. It's the first in a proposed trilogy and I for one am chomping at the bit. Akin
to Stevie Wonder in his heyday, and is there any higher compliment than that?
4. Willie Nelson  American Classic  (Stardust II)/ Rosanne Cash  The List  (the Great American
Songbook, country style) - There's still a prejudice in rock and roll about covers. Not so in country. Willie
Nelson delivered his umpteenth sequel to his best-seller Stardust ; it just so happens that this time he did
it right. Meanwhile, Cash proves the singer in "singer-songwriter" can deliver too, with songs her father
pinpointed as essential. So are both these albums.
5. Madeleine Peyroux  Bare Bones /Melody Gardot  My One And Only Thrill /Kristina Train  Spilt
Milk  (songbirds, via Paris and Memphis) -- Sure, every artist wants to be dealt with on their own terms
but it's only natural to compare one talent to another. So Peyroux is an heir to Billie Holiday but
increasingly her own gal. Gardot is an heir to...well, Peyroux. And Train is clearly Blue Note's desire to
mint another Norah Jones but she owes more to Dusty Springfield. All three deliver wonderfully.
6. Mark Olson & Gary Louris  Ready For The Flood  (Jayhawks redux) -- Oh how I love the Jayhawks.
Just hearing these two voices wind around each other again is a pleasure. And thank goodness their
album delivered on every level. I'm just surprised it wasn't more fussed over by the critics. Sheer delight.
7. Mayer Hawthorne  A Strange Arrangement  (blue eyed soul) -- Sometimes, you CAN discover an
artist via the slush pile. There it was, just sitting there, with a note from an acquaintance insisting it was
really good. Yeah right. But, hell, it really IS good, blue-eyed soul delivered with fervor and charm. Fun
stuff.
8. Loudon Wainwright  High, Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project  (hilarious, heartfelt
blues) -- Never been a huge fan of Loudon Wainwright's recordings, though he has a classic debut and is
a fun live performer. His kids (Rufus and Martha), of course, are bursting with talent, thanks to Loudonas a dad and the late, great Kate McGarrigle as a mom. But here Loudon blossoms as never before.
Poole's music suits him to a tee and he delivers these amusingly wry tunes of a ne'er do well with relish,
sticking to suitably rustic arrangements that never seem retro, but rather just right. Great fun.
9. The XX  The XX  (boy-girl dynamics)/ Girls Album  (quietly ambitious rock) -- The two best debuts of
the year. UK band The XX play off a boy-girl dynamic whereas Girls features all guys and an anything
goes retro rock sound that jumbles 50s rock n roll with modern influences. You never can tell with newbands, but these are terrific debuts and I'm eager to hear more.
10. Duncan Sheik  Whisper House  (the real twilight soundtrack) -- What's a guy have to do to get some
attention? Duncan Sheik has been a pop star and critics' darling. He's co-created a musical that turned
into a Broadway smash and won every Tony in sight. He's paid obeisance to Nick Drake both in concert
(where he's performed the album Pink Moon  in its entirety) and on albums (where he resides in the same
hushed world of confessional pop). And now he's working on multiple musical projects, including The
Emperor and the Nightingale  and this, which is about a haunted lighthouse. With all that, how come I
didn't know about this CD of music for that work in progress until I saw it in a store? It's absorbing,
wonderful stuff, perfect for fans of his musicals OR his increasingly sophisticated pop career.
11. Nellie McKay  Normal As Blueberry Pie: A Tribute To Doris Day  (effortless old-fashioned pop) --
Another talent destined for Broadway greatness, McKay has delivered several wonderfully quirky pop
albums and is now collaborating on at least two or three musicals that have their eye on Broadway. I
think the discipline of a musical and its storyline will be perfect for focusing her all-encompassing talent.But until one of those musicals appears we have this: her finest pop album to date. On it, McKay pays
tribute to her idol, the perennially under-appreciated acting and singing talent Doris Day. McKay's
arrangements of Day classics are wonderful and her vocals are marvelous. It's a tribute to both of them.
12. The Black Crowes  Before The Frost...Until The Freeze  (roots rock enlivened by a live audience) --
You'd think a pop music critic wouldn't be prejudiced but of course they are. I always dismissed the Black
Crowes as anonymous Southern rock until I saw the two brothers performing an acoustic song onLetterman, where they blew me away. That set me up perfectly for appreciating this double album, much
of which was recorded in front of a live audience and reveals their breadth of rustic talent AND their
Southern rock skills.
13. Brad Paisley  American Saturday Night  (country with a dash of humor) -- Forget Zac Brown and his
frightening mash-up of country music and jam bands. Paisley is the real heir apparent to Jimmy Buffett
and a bigger talent in every way. This album was picked as #1 of the year by Time  magazine, mostly as a
nod to Paisley's great consistency over the past decade. He always delivers funny, witty, solid albumsfrom beginning to end. But this charmer may be his best, thanks to an all-encompassing vision ofTOP VIDEO PICKS

<p>America that celebrates immigrants and people of all stripes to rueful tunes about parenthood like
"Anything Like Me." Whoever said country music was right wing never listened to the outlaws or to
Paisley.
14. Allen Toussaint  The Bright Mississippi  (casual jazz brilliance) -- Toussaint dives into the history of
jazz steeped in New Orleans, flavored with his own distinctive talent. A debut for Nonesuch and a notably
exceptional one in his long career. Thank producer Joe Henry and great support throughout.
15. Pearl Jam  Backspacer  (the sound of veterans waking up)/ Green Day  21st Century Breakdown
(worthy successor to American Idiot; really) -- Never been a huge fan of Pearl Jam, probably because I've
never seen them live. But this short, sharp, shocked album of ferociously tuneful rock blew me away. That
means hardcore fans will truly love it or be nonplussed. To me, they haven't sounded this raucous, this
fun, this UN-sanctimonious since Ten . Everyone loved Green Day's American Idiot.  But I think only Billy
Joe wanted to see them become a latter day Who and turn out another concept album. If you just ignorethe very modest concept album trappings, however, 21st Century Breakdown  is a terrific collection of
great rock songs and a worthy followup. But please, no Lighthouse  project.
16. Bassekou Kouyate  I Speak Fula / Vieux Farka Toure  Fondo  (world class world music) --
Kouyate is a master of the banjo-like precursor the ngoni while Vieux follows in the footsteps of hislegendary father. Both produce world class world music, rooted in tradition without either closingthemselves off to modern influences or feeling the need (like Bebel Gilberto) to stay current at the sake ofquality.
17. Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band  Outer South  (Americana)/ Elliott Brood  Mountain
Meadows  (Canadiana)/ Low Anthem  Oh My God, Charlie Darwin  (evolutionana) -- It's an Americana
hoedown showdown. I keep waiting for Oberst to stumble: he's too obvious an eccentric folkie, too
obviously following in Dylan's footsteps (just like Dylan too obviously followed Woody Guthrie) and yetalbum after album he rewards my attention. Elliott Brood is a little known Canadian band I discovered in
a bar when they were still self-releasing their music. They've grown by leaps and bounds and landed a
label deal; they haven't quite broken through yet, but they will. And Low Anthem delivered a charmerthat would probably place higher on my list if I hadn't just discovered it and only been album to play it a
few times. "Charlie Darwin" is haunting and weird but much of it is thoroughly accessible Americana,
which is to say country-ish, folk-ish but cool-ish rock n roll. Good stuff.
18. Alicia Keys  The Element Of Freedom  (tougher beats; same talent) -- Her new album came out
rather quietly at the end of the year. Here Keys moves away from the melodic keyboard sound that made
her name and focuses on rhythm and beats more. So when the album concludes with the melodic,keyboard driven "Empire State Of Mind" it feels like an emotional, artistic release that's quite moving. A
serious talent.
19. M. Ward  Hold Time  (faithful pop) -- A protean talent, whether collaborating with actress Zooey
Deschanel on She & Him, the supergroup Monsters of Folk or his solo work. Here, Ward delivers songs
that probe the mysteries and rewards of spirituality, all wrapped up in tunes that are effortlessly melodic.
20. RZA  Afro Samurai: Resurrection /Raekwon  Only Built For Cuban Linx...Part II (keeping the lights
on for hip-hop) - Someone had to keep the lights on for hip-hop and in this down year, it was RZA and
Raekwon who both delivered solid albums that weren't quite as revolutionary as their previous work but
still welcome nonetheless.
21. James Hand  Shadow On The Ground  (honky-tonk to its bone) -- I'm not sure anyone has ever
talked about James Hand without mentioning Hank Williams and I'm certainly not going to start now.
Hand delivers honky tonk that is FIRMLY in the Hank Williams tradition and if it weren't so darn good,you'd dismiss it as aping the master. But it is darn good stuff, whether his excellent originals or some
smart covers. Pure undistilled country.
22. Monsters Of Folk  Monsters Of Folk  (a super supergroup) -- I think the biggest musical trend of the
past few years has been the cross-pollination of so many artists. Anyone with any sense has a portable or
home recording studio that can deliver high quality sound and of course you can offer music to the worldas long as you have high speed internet access. So why wouldn't people collaborate willy nilly? It'shappening all over the place, such as this super group of members of My Morning Jacket, Bright Eyes
and M. Ward. You'll think CSN more than Asia. Distinctive and good enough to make you certain this
isn't a one-off but a real group like the Raconteurs.
23. Brendan Benson  My Old, Familiar Friend  (power pop) - Journeyman pop star Brendan Benson
has had his fans of course. I enjoyed him when I heard him but never felt compelled to seek him out. But
the Raconteurs put some spine in him, I think, because this solo album is his most cohesive and
swaggering yet.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST</p>
<p>24. Various Artists  Ghana Special: Modern Highlife, Afro Sounds & Ghanaian Blues 1968-1981
(Soundways, the world music label du jour, delivers again) - Soundways is the world music label that is
currently delivering some of the smartest and nicely packaged pop music from around the world. Who
else would put out three CDs of music from Panama? Ghana Special is one of their deluxe editions withgorgeous packaging and great song selections but you can't go wrong with anything by them right now.
25. Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs  Under The Covers Vol. 2  (Seventies power pop done to
perfection) - Even better than Vol, 1, this followup has the two really jamming on Seventies AM radio
classics. Yeah, they often offer up the classic original arrangements with delight. So what? And hearing
Hoffs drip with sexiness through "Bell Bottom Blues" or cooing "Let's go all the way" on the Raspberriesgem is reward in and of itself. And Yes's "I've Seen All Good People" is a showstopper.
26. Miranda Lambert  Revolution  (a Nashville star)/ Claire Lynch  Whatcha Gonna Do  (bluegrass
heaven) - Miranda Lambert was the THIRD runner-up on Nashville Star's first season. But she had a
great song in her and her debut album was a surprise smash. It's been all uphill from there, as she's
improved steadily as a singer and songwriter. Her third CD is her best yet, filled with independent gal
lyrics the Dixie Chicks would love and enough melody for two Carrie Underwood albums. Claire Lynch is
a bluegrass singer who's also come into her own. Fans of those other artists (or similar talent like Alison
Krauss) should check them both out.
27. Phoenix  Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix  (college rock, but still good) - Everyone but everyone had
Phoenix on their lists this year. The more I listened to their album the less certain I am about them. But
they did have some killer singles and the sound was distinctive enough to keep me waiting patiently for
their next CD and finding out whether they're a flash in the pan or genuine artists.
28. Sufjan Stevens & Osso  Run Rabbit Run  (instrumentals a la Glass) - I'm still waiting impatiently
for the next album in Sufjan's (jokingly?) proposed 50 cd cycle of concept albums devoted to each state
in the Union. This Glassian string of instrumentals devotes one track to each animal in the Chinese
calendar years (Tiger, Rabbit, etc.) and proves - after a symphonic piece about a highway and a string of
marvelous Christmas EPs) that Sufjan can indeed do anything.
29. St. Vincent  Actor  (quiet/loud/quiet/strange) -- This album keeps me off kilter. Sometimes it's soft
and quiet, sometimes loud, sometimes rocking, sometimes folk-ish, sometimes experimental and
sometimes all of these things in the same song. Kept me guessing and that's a good thing.
30. Jay-Z  The Blueprint 3  (luxury hip hop) - Third time was not quite the charm for me in this followup
to the followup to his landmark album The Blueprint. Still, Jay-Z delivered some compelling moments
(especially his wholesale lifting of that glorious Alicia Keys track) in a year when Hip hop really did seem
dead.
31. Jesse Winchester  Love Filling Station  (journeyman troubadour delivers) - Thank you Elvis Costello
for introducing me to Jesse Winchester. I'd vaguely heard of this singer-songwriter (and his classic debut
CD) but never really gave him a lesson. But the moment he opened his mouth on Costello's TV show
Spectacle I was stopped short by that wonderfully distinctive, appealing voice. Then he performed instant
classic "Sham-A-Ling-Dong-Ding" and I had to get the album immediately. This new one seems toinclude some tunes in his repertoire for years but what of it? It's a winner.
32. Prefab Sprout  Let's Change The World With Music (lost in the vaults gem) - I'm helpless when it
comes to Prefab Sprout and the talents of singer songwriter Paddy McAloon. I've loved (almost)
everything he's done since his debut CD Swoon  in the mid-80s. Think Steely Dan crossed with Gershwin
to get an idea of the pure pop genius of this artist. This album was the followup to his acclaimed  Jordan:
The Comeback which his label bizarrely rejected. Now we finally get to hear it with some minimaltweaking and it's glorious: like Jordan , it playfully deals with God and faith and love with tuneful
romanticism. Religious belief has rarely been this catchy.
33. Geraint Watkins In A Bad Mood  (Randy Newman and Tom Waits' love child) - A new one to me,
suggested by my friend Sal, who has New Orleans in the blood. So does Geraint, who sets the tone nicely
with "It's Easy To Say 'Bon Temps Rouler,'" an ode to happy times amidst heartache. Gentle rueful,
tuneful.
34. Elvis Costello  Secret, Profane & Sugarcane  (elder statesman can still deliver) - Costello has always
found rejuvenation in various genres. Here it's a return to Nashville, delivered in rootsy style thanks to
producer T Bone Burnett and ace musicians. This one will grow in stature.
35. Chip Taylor  Yonkers NY (story-song oddity) - I'd never heard word one about Chip Taylor till this
album. It's an eccentric affair, with Taylor starting songs, stopping in the middle to tell a story and then</p>
<p>finishing up. Or telling a story and then singing the song. Or the reverse. Whatever his approach, it's got a
winning "live album" feel for a new collection of memorable songs. Unique.
36. Tori Amos Midwinter Graces  (a holiday album for the ages) - I devour holiday CDs and count
myself lucky if an album can produce one good original Christmas or even one distinctive cover of a
chestnut worth saving. This CD is the rare Christmas album that succeeds completely, combining oddly
appealing re-imaginings of classic tunes like "Silent Night" and "Noel" with new songs. Far better than
her new CD of secular tunes and probably my favorite Amos album of all.
37. Diana Krall  Quiet Nights  (Elvis's better half delivers again) - Krall is a fine pianist and singer but I
didn't think she really shined until collaborating with arranger and producer Claus Ogerman on The Look
Of Love  in 2001. Whatever the reason, his pillow of strings brings out the best in her vocals. Eight years
later they're working together again in the studio and the result is another gentle gem. Why she doesn't
always work with him is beyond me.
38. The Black Hollies  Softly, Towards The Light  (psychedelic nuggets) - This Jersey psychedelic
garage band is rooted in the Nuggets-era classics but somehow their music seems fresh instead of retro.
They keep churning out this infectious gems and in a better world they'd be played on the radio all of the
time instead of just once in a blue moon by the likes of Little Steven. Fun fun stuff.
39. Mika  The Boy Who Knew Too Much  (pure pop, with swagger) - To me, Mika's debut CD was a little
over-praised, though infectious pop to be sure. Now his followup seems a little under-praised. I think
he's grown on every level, though still basically just a delightful successor to the likes of Queen andGeorge Michael. State of the art pop for those who still love it.
40. Rickie Lee Jones  Balm In Gilead  (return to form) - I always roll my eyes when Rolling Stone
magazine dutifully gives four stars out of five to the latest albums by R.E.M. or Springsteen or U2 or
indeed the Rolling Stones. It just seems a knee-jerk reaction to past glory rather than a fair assessment of
their latest work. But beloved acts CAN come through again, such as Jones. She's followed up her
wackiest album (a beatnik-y spoken word sort of religious tract) with one of her warmest and mostaccessible CDs. It's easily her best since Flying Cowboys.  If you've been a fan, don't hesitate.
THE BEST BOXED SETS OF 2009
The Beatles  Mono  - Obviously, the event of the year if not the decade musically was the remastering of
the Beatles catalog. But it wasn't just improved sound. We finally got to hear their albums in mono, the
way the Beatles intended, for the first time really since the albums came out in the Sixties. The 70s LPsand the cassettes and CDs I grew up with were all based on the stereo mixes, which were afterthoughts
for the Beatles. (Only Let It Be  and Abbey Road  were released only in stereo originally.) This isn't a
minor point because the mono mixes are substantially different. It's like seeing classic films by your
favorite director and finding out that in the original cut the scenes were ordered differently, actors came
in at different moments and even spoke different lines. It's especially mind-blowing on The White Album,
which now seems to me even more magnificent. Sgt. Pepper  sounds so remarkable that for the first time
I actually did listen to it and think THAT'S their masterpiece (rather than Revolver  or Abbey Road  or
The White Album,  depending on my mood). Still the greatest band of all and they always will be.
Neil Young  Archives  - I bet there are people who still clutch onto some beloved CD-ROM. Some very
clever companies released great products in that format. Neil Young designed this boxed set for the
BluRay and while I'm almost certain this is a cul de sac rather than the future of music boxed sets, it's an
awfully tantalizing one that overflows with information. It's literally like an encyclopedia of the era forYoung. Overwhelming. He just grows in stature for me year after year.
Buddy Holly  Not Fade Away: The Complete Studio Recordings And More - I've been waiting for this
boxed set since literally the advent of CDs. I would read in the Rolling Stone Record Guide about the five
star review of the LP equivalent to this and just chomp at the bit to get my hands on it, never imagining it
would be 25 years (!!) before they'd get around to it. Nothing could be quite worth the wait and much ofthis has come out in smaller sets in the last few years. But it's still amazing to see the explosive growth ofHolly. Has anyone ever had such massive influence with so little actual output? Not even Hendrix or Nick
Drake can match him.
Dolly Parton  Dolly  - The most amazing fact about this 4 CD 99 song boxed set of one of music's most
talented songwriters and singers is that it's incomplete. It stops in 1991, before her amazing string of
bluegrass albums that serve as a career peak to equal her best. Her place in country and pop history isassured and she doesn't seem even remotely done yet. And when all is said and done, it's the catalog of
songs that she's created that will prove her most enduring legacy. What a talent. And I STILL haven't</p>
<p>seen her in concert or interviewed her. Kills me.
Woody Guthrie  My Dusty Road  - The sonic upgrade of Woody Guthrie's catalog is very welcome and
notable indeed. You simply cannot argue with music this enduring and entertaining. But on a practical
level, I have to acknowledge this is kind of a rip. This music is 60 years old. So what excuse is this forspreading out this short tunes onto 4 CDs? (They contain 13, 14, 12 (twelve!!) and 15 tracks and thosecould easily fit onto 2 CDs.) The result is an $80 set that should have cost $40 and come out on 2 discs.
The more people that can afford and hear his music the better. But this set, as sterling as it sounds,
ignores that. Amazon sells it on download for $37, but really, is the physical CD that much of an
afterthought these days?
THE BEST REISSUES OF 2009
The Stone Roses  The Stone Roses  - I keep forgetting that a lot of Americans don't really know this
album, which is a landmark in the UK. It is swirling, hypnotic absolutely essential rock n roll.
Rosemary Clooney  Blue Rose  and Love  - It's almost impossible to do anymore, but I found myself in
J&R Music World in NYC actually browsing the aisles of a record store fully stocked in all sorts of genres
and finding stuff I didn't even know I wanted. Case in point: these two CDs from Clooney. Blue Rose  is a
collaboration with Duke Ellington that was reissued in 2008 while Love  is arranged and produced by her
lover Nelson Riddle. Both are absolutely peak, peak recordings that raise Clooney in my estimation. (I've
been more familiar with her late period renaissance on Concord.) The most amazing thing is that both
CDs were under $10. Blue Rose was actually $7. Seven dollars!! I was THRILLED to buy it at that price.Think the record labels are missing a beat by keeping catalog titles at such high prices?
Freddie Hubbard  Without A Song: Live in Europe 1969 - A swinging set from one of jazz's great
trumpeters. A welcome reminder of jazz's potency in a year so devoid of excitement in that genre.
The Jayhawks  Music From The North Country - The new collaboration between Mark Olson and Gary
Louris is so successful, it made all the nicer to dive into this anthology for a band that hasn't quite
received its due yet.

Madeleine Peyroux's covers album "Careless Love" is one of my 10 favorite albums of the past
decade, but her latest album of all-new material "Bare Bones" was one of my biggest disappointments of 2009 (along with the new U2 album). Peyroux is simply nowhere near as talented of asongwriter as she is a vocalist.
My favorite records of 2009:
Andrew Bird - Noble BeastThe Dead Weather - Horehound (even better than the White Stripes' "Icky Thump" LP)Forro in the Dark - Light a CandleSerge Gainsbourg - Histoire de Melody Nelson (reissue)Gilles Peterson (fantastic British DJ on BBC) - Brazilika
Alice Russell - Pot of Gold
Just a quick correction on your Phoenix entry. Their latest album "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart" is
actually their fourth studio album.

Whoops! And a quick correction on my entry: "Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix" not "Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart".
Thanks for the catch. I've corrected 'second" to "next" album.Recency  |  Popularity

14 FansI would like to add my recommenda tion, the recent Grammy award winner for best jazz vocal
performanc e, Kurt Elling's "Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman"
http://kur telling.co m/music/de dicated_to _you/
Thanks for the suggestion . The John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman collaborat ion is one of
my all-time favorites so I'll check it out.
In the "It's Never Too Late to Hear Great Music" vein, do a YouTube search for Happy Rhodes (her
real name), for instance, "Temporary and Eternal." Here's a woman with a phenomenal , gorgeous
voice (4 octave range), beautiful music, interestin g lyrics, has been making music for over 25 years,
has 11 wonderful, high-quali ty albums, but is totally obscure. Not because she's not fiercely
talented, but because she's never been on a major record label, and because she's too much of ahomebody to go out on the road for whirlwind national tours. She prefers her husband, cats andfarm to tours, fame and glory. There's nothing wrong with that. But she is a world-clas s talent and it
is a shame she isn't better-kno wn. 
She's not in it for the money, all 11 albums are on YouTube as audio-only tracks, and elsewhere asstreaming audio. There are several dozen live clips too if anyone's interested . Maybe one day
something will happen, the timing will be right, and she'll be discovered . Her fascinatin g story will be
told and her incredible music will be heard. Or, maybe not. But the music is there, timeless andpatiently waiting.
(She's not making music currently so I'm not promoting anything. I've been a fan for 21 years and
want others to hear her. Not to benefit Happy, or myself, but because I know how her music hastouched people's lives.)
Never heard of her so I'm intrigued. Thanks for the tip.
Thank you for saying so, I appreciate it. Of course, I'm ridiculous ly biased, so my
opinion doesn't mean much, but I think her voice and her music speaks for itself. Itisn't that one or two songs shine, it's a whole body of work, since 1986, when shestarted releasing her first 4 albums on hand-dubbe d cassettes, to 2007, when she
self-relea sed her 11th album (after being on 2 different indie labels in between). If
you do listen, and if you do like what you hear, I can pretty much guarantee thatthe more you hear, the more impressed you'll be. Some may not be to your taste,her albums are eclectic. There's very lush, layered and electronic (Many WorldsAre Born Tonight), and there's simple, quiet and peaceful (The Keep), and there'sodd pop (Building The Colossus) and others. Always original, but always pureHappy Rhodes. Some...ok, a lot of her songs are dark and scary, and many arenot, but they're always about things, either storytelli ng or very personal. She
doesn't do love songs. Many, if not most, are very psychologi cal, which makes
sense the more you know about Happy the person. She's got a hell of a backstory.She's got a dark and fun sense of humor too.
Anyway, I wouldn't want to drive you away by being too talky. My enthusiasm can
easily get out of control and cause people to back off. I'm harmless, just
passionate . :) Happy knows.Permalink  | Share it

If you do get a chance to listen, and if you do get interested (and I would
understand if you don't because of different tastes), and want to know more abouther, there's a bit more informatio n of the MySpace page I put up for her and
maintain since she's not much of an internet person ( http://www .myspace.c
om/happyrh odes ). It doesn't go into too much depth, but it covers many of the
basics.
And second, I was very rude by not even commenting on your blog here, which I
did read and enjoyed. I'm a female vocals fan, so I read those first. What I likemost is that it's so eclectic, from the wonderful Regina Spektor to Nellie McKay(Nellie does Doris? Oh my god, how did I not know about this? Thank you fortelling me) to Tori (who, btw, is a Happy Rhodes fan) to Ella to Rosemary toMadeleine to Melody to Rickie Lee to St. Vincent, wow. I knew all of them, but Ihadn't heard of Kristina Train, and just the mention of Dusty Springfiel d is enough
to interest me. I used to have a radio show featuring female vocals, and I'd playeveryone from Billie to Diamanda Galas, Kate Bush to Rickie Lee, kd lang (waybefore she was famous) to Lotte Lenya. I love eclectic. I have huge disagreeme nts
with you concerning movies, but music-wise , I love your eclectic taste.
There is no shortage of praise for Ella, but your simplistic take on Billie Holiday begs a rebuttal.That she was given only "weak" material early in her career, does not at all address why. Thatwould involve an explanatio n, for those who do not know, of the relationsh ip between songwriter s,
publishers and singers in her time, and just who it was that would have been given access to themore superior songs of the time. 
Lady Day's magic is singular. She transforme d that weak material into a superior expression . Her
abilty to tweak a melody, to "worry" a phrase (as the blues people put it) her sense of the dynamic,
all these things practicall y inform all the singers in her wake. It isn't always about range, as a
double dozen "vocalists " today just ought to learn, but about how one plays the rhythm. Billie
Holidays sense to time was nothing less than praeternat ural. Just simply try and sing along with her.
Her recordings with Lester Young are absolutely magical. It is criminal that they were only able towork together for the short period that they did. 
Nellie McKay is absolutely wonderful. Diana Krall hurts my ears.
Thanks for weighing in. Of course I had to be simplistic in a brief paragraph. But take it as
a given that I'm a huge fan of all the singers I mentioned, including of course the greatBillie Holiday. I own every legal recording ever released of hers: all the complete boxed setsand love them all for various reasons. No library is complete without her. Taking that as agiven, I was just suggesting that since Ella so quickly moved beyond "A-Tisket" to classicstandards (indeed, helping to cement those standards as the great American songbook asmuch as anyone) and her much longer career of high quality that maybe she edged outBillie in the silly but fun contest of comparing two amazing talents and ranking them. But ofcourse no history of jazz is complete without either of them.
One of my favorite performanc es on record is "Ella in Berlin" when she forgets the
lyric of "Mac The Knife" and and wings it, swinging harder than likely if she did notforget. For Lady Day, it is hard to choose between, "He's Funny That Way" and "I'llNever Be The Same", the fondant on those two cakes being some of the mostexquisite Pres on record. 
Indeed, any choice on a moment's notice, in that company, will not disappoint . AnyXenussister    06:26 AM on 2/17/2010

May I suggest Wild Beasts 'Two Dancers'? The XX's debut is fantastic. Must listen material.
And I'm with you on the Stone Roses remaster. State of the art!
A new one to me; thanks for the tip.
That Rickie Lee Jones CD was gawd-awful . So, I take your other recommenda tions with a big grain
of salt, my friend. I admire your enthusiasm , though. Music is the bomb, good and bad.
How about a little K'Naan - Troubador? Was that released this year?
May I make a suggestion ? I never agree -- or rarely agree -- with every item on a best of
the year list be it in movies or music or theater or tv or books or whatever. So I look for
people with tastes I seem to be in sync with. If you've listened to and liked four or five ofthe artists on this list (maybe you're a country fan and like Paisley or a blues fan and likeLoudon's take on Charlie Poole), then you might look for something I recommend that youhaven't listened to yet and think it might be worth clicking on the link. That's all. I'll bet if youmade a list and I liked five or six of the artists on it that I might be able to discoversomeone else i"d like to. Thinking someone's opinion is useless just because you hatedone out of the 51 albums I listed in the main section means you might dismiss most lists bymost critics ever. On the other hand, if you see me listing artist after artist you don't like orcrap albums by a lot of artists you do like that didn't do their best work that year, then ofcourse you'd be right to not pay attention. But people with taste I admire invariablyrecommend something I don't care for or can't understand why I praise something. Ithappens.
Oh, and I forgot. I've seen K'Nann's name a few times on best of lists but couldn't find the
CD in any local stores before finishing my own (though I did spend loads of money trying tofill in my gaps). I will definitely check it out.
A very thoughtful and well-writt en list. Thanks for directing me to the Ella set.Permalink  | Share it

59 FansI haven't heard all of the CD's mentioned of course, but of the ones I have you nailed the qualities
beautifull y. That Sweet/Hoff s CD is a delight, with Lindsey Buckingham and Steve Howe playing the
their guitar parts on their songs ( if I'm not mistaken.) Pearl Jam was fantastic, as was the Monsters
of Folk. I'll definitely check out the other recommenda tions.
Damn, now I wish I had bought the mono Beatles... .
The Mono Beatles is very available if very expensive. But worth every penny. Start sockingaway those coins! Thanks for reading.
Love The XX. Since the first listen, this one has been on my playlist non-stop. Will have to checkout "Girls."
Also, liked Grizzly Bear "Veckatime st" quite a bit. Interestin g, complicate d, kind of haunting
melodies. The song "Two Weeks" is worth the price of the album alone.
I liked the Grizzly Bear too, but not quite enough to get on my already lengthy list, though
"Two Weeks" is certainly a highlight. Animal Collective , Super Furry Animals, Cass
McCombs and plenty of others got a look see. The bottom of my story has a link to mywebsite which takes you to my blog which regularly updates everything I listen to with aquick star rating if you're so inclined. Thanks for reading! I think you'll like Girls if you likeXX. Both very worthy.
Best album last year was the new Cheap Trick album "The Latest." Fantastic from start to finish, not
a stinker in the bunch. 
And as much as it pains me to say it, Susan Boyle's "I Dreamed a Dream" is haunting, under-stat
ed, and displays a vulnerable and delicate voice. I'm still amazed that a classic rock fan like meloved it so much.
You're the third person to mention the Cheap Trick album to me. I will definitely bechecking it out. And are you kidding about the Susan Boyle is it indeed lovely? I didn't carefor any of her live performanc es but anything is possible and I do try to (gulp) keep an open
mind.
