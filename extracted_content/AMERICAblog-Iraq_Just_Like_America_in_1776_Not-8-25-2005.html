8/25/2005 03:44:00 PMThe only thing Bush changes more than his excuse for invadingIraq is what he compares this unnecessary war to in order tomake it seem noble. Bush and his supporters have comparedthe conflict to World War II, World War I, the RevolutionaryWar and just about anything else you can think of exceptVietnam. Now they're comparing the writing of the constitutionof Iraq to America's own Constitutional process. As Bill Mahersaid on his Friday show, give me a break: for one thing,Alexander Hamilton's people weren't responsible for thegenocidal killing of tens of thousands of Benjamin Franklin'speople. For another, the writing of the Constitution wasn'tinterrupted by violence like this in Iraq:In violence today, armed insurgents locked a family ofseven in a single room in Khadra, western Baghdad, placedexplosives throughout the house, and then exploded them.Two women and five men were killed in the blasts, anInterior Ministry official said.Two roadside bombs blew up as an armed convoy used byPresident Talabani was traveling south of Kirkuk toBaghdad, the local police said. Insurgents then opened fire,killing two bodyguards and wounding six, Brig. SarhadQadir of the Kirkuk police said.Oh and in a very related event, 36 more bodies of men were foundnaked and slaughtered on a border town near Iran. No civil war tosee here, keep moving.
