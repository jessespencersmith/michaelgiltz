Q) z The Last Samurai * * 
Warner Bros. $29.98 
Tom Cruise scored the biggest international hit of his career with 
this stodgy drama about a disillusioned Civil War veteran who 
regains his dignity by teaming up with a renegade samurai in 
Japan; But eVen war buffs will have a hard time with the hokum of 
this film's weepy finale. Loads of extras, of course. If you're 
hankering for more swordplay, check out the much cooler cartoon 
"Samurai Jack" -Season I ($29.98, Warner Bros.). 
Gilmore Girls -
Complete First 
s.eason ***1/, 
Warner Bros. $59.98 
This delightful mother~daugh­
ter drama jumped the shark 
this year when Rory (Alexis 
BledeD went to college. But 
fans can take comfort in the 
marvelous first season, where 
the banter was always witty 
and the stories always real. 
The Marx Brothers 
Collection 
*** Warner Bros. $59.92 
" Everyone knows the "animal" 
movies by the Marx Brothers 
("Duck Soup," "Animal 
Crackers," etc.) are the best. 
But at least two other flicks in 
this seven-movie set -"A 
Night At The Opera" and "A 
Day At The Races" -are 
right up there, too. 
The Triplets of 
Belleville ***1/2 
Son Pictures Classics $24.96 
"Finding Nemo" was sweet, 
but the best animated fIlm of 
2003 was this off-beat charmer 
about a cyclist named 
r'h"l.1"'r'IIT\~l"\n A uTf'tonrlprf1111v quirky film filled with aging 
dancehall singers who feast on 
frogs, a running gag about 
trains and that infectious title 
song. Modest extras round out 
this personal triumph for 
director Sylvain Chomet. 
5 Films about Christo 
and Jeanne-Claude *-**1/2 
Plexifilm $59.95 
Next February, grand-scale 
artists Christo and Jeane­
Claude will install their latest 
"vork in Central Park: 7,500 16-
foot-tall vinyl gates holding up 
saffron fabric panels. The 
Maysles brothers, famous for 
their cinema verite documen­
taries on everything from 
Jackie Kennedy's relatives to 
Mick Jagger, document their 
earlier mad schemes on three 
discs filled with commentaries 
from all involved. 
~~Jzer Pan 
Universal $26.98 
].M. Barrie's classic has been 
captured brilliantly on stage 
and TV; but still falls short on 
film. Steven Spielberg's 1991 
"Hook" was woeful, and this 
latest stab by director P.]. 
Hogan has a fine cast, but is 
too broad and comic to db the 
tale justice.</p>
