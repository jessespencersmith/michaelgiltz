            <p>T H U R S D AY,  D E C E M B E R  1 5 ,  2 0 0 5DVDs Out Tuesday January 17My weekly DVD column got squeezed out of the Post this week -- toomuch space taken up by Golden Globes coverage. Here's the column Ifiled, which inevitably would have had one item cut and the othersshortened even more.The Mary Tyler Moore Show Complete Third Season****Fox$29.98Unquestionably the best sitcom of all time, this is the season where“MTM” started firing on all cylinders – Ted gets a girlfriend, Rhodaloses weight, and Mary throws a disastrous dinner party. Every episodeis quick-witted, smart, and rooted in characters we know so well asimple grunt from Lou can draw a big laugh. Now where’s season four?Junebug***Sony$26.96Alessandro Nivola is worried he’ll be embarrassed about where hecame from when he and his art gallery owner wife Embeth Davidtz visithis family in the South. The surprise is that he becomes moreembarrassed of her. Amy Adams scores as the pregnant, sweet wife of“The OC’s” Ben McKensie. Extras include deleted scenes andcommentary by the cast.Mr. Show – The Complete Collection*** ½HBO$79.98Still freaking out over the possibility that “Arrested Development” maysoon be swimming with the fishes? Dive into “Mr. Show,” the HBOsketch comedy series starring Bob Odenkirk and David Cross (Tobiason “AD”). Warning: it makes that sitcom seem positively normal incomparison. Loaded with extras, including commentary on all 30episodes.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
