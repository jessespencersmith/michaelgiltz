3/24/2005 02:29:00 AMIn the Washington Post, columnist Richard Cohen blasts theDemocrats for failing to stand on its principles in the TerriSchiavo case."But for me the real loser was the Democratic Party. It showedthat it's almost totally without leadership. If there is a nationalfigure (other than [Barney] Frank) who stood up and took onthe GOP in this matter, his -- or her -- name does not come tomind. In the Senate, oddly enough, it was Virginia's JohnWarner who pointed out that he opposed the bill -- and he's aRepublican, for goodness' sake. The Democrats were nowhere,"says Cohen in the Washington Post.Yes, the Dems stole defeat out of the jaws of victory. Again.The majority of Americans stand with the Dems on majorissues. Unfortunately, the Dems are afraid to stand with themajority of Americans. Think anyone will apologize? Thinkanyone will get the message? Neither do I.
