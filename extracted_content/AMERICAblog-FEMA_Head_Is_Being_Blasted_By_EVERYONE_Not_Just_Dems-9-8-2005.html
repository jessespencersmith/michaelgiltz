9/08/2005 10:05:00 PMUSA Today has an item in today's paper -- I can't find it online,though. The short piece under Hurricane Roundup on page 5Ais titled "FEMA chief rebuffs critics," and is written by Mimi Hall.It says:Federal Emergency Management Agency chief MichaelBrown rebuffed calls from Democrats for his resignation,saying he serves "totally at the will of the president."That's funny, because a day earlier Hall contributed to a story aboutthis same controversy that stated accurately:[FEMA head Michael Brown] doesn't mention the decade hespent as chief rules enforcer for the Arabian HorseAssociation.The horse job, which he left in 2000, is now fodder forcritics who say Brown, head of the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency (FEMA), has botched the Katrina reliefoperation. Those critics include Republicans,Democrats and newspapers.Indeed, that article quotes William Kristol of The Weekly Standard --as conservative as it gets -- blasting Brown and you could alsoinclude the New York Post and many others. But in one day thewidespread call for the firing of an incompetent hack who costinnocent Americans their lives has morphed into what is implied as apartisan attack by Democrats. Keeping the MSM on its toes is a 24/7job.
