HIGHER GROUND 
.. 0 MOVIE GENRE FREES THE COMPOSER.'S 
imagination quite as readily as science 
fiction. Grand statements abound, to 
the extent that a modest sci-fi score is about as 
com.mon as a low-key opera. Here are just a 
few classic examples, offering everything from 
Wagnerian might to cheeky sambas ... 
ALEX NORTH'S 2001: Possibly the great­
est score not in a movie, this was reportedly 
commissioned by Stanley Kubrick to appease 
the studio, though he never intended to use it. 
In the finished film, of course, he used a selec­
tion of classical pieces -including Johann 
Strauss's 'D1e BLue Danube and Richard Strauss's 
Thus Spake Zarathustra -to brilliant effect. 
Now, 25 years later, we can finally hear 
North's work. From the dramatic organ flour­
ish in the Main Title to the charming waltz of 
Space Station Docking (where Kubrick used The 
Blue Danube), it is certainly worth the wait. the John Williams triptych: one CD for each 
film, a fourth for miscellaneous cues, and a lav­
ishly illustrated booklet with track-by-track 
commentary. 
PLANET OF THE APES: An early land­
mark for composer Jerry Goldsmith, this 
jagged, inventive music is, naturally, reminis­
cent of his style on TV's The Twilight Zone and 
contains a justly famous cue -The Hunt -that 
incorporates a ram's hom. 
THE ALIEN TRILOGY: Few other film 
series have given birth to such diverse and sat­
isfying movie music. The original ALien, by 
Jerry Goldsmith, is genuinely unnerving; 
ALiens, by Janles Homer, is foreboding when­
ever it isn't plunging headlong into the fray; 
and Alien3, by Elliot Goldenthal, combines a 
clever but creepy musical signature for the 
nasty creatures with a contemp lative, vaguely 
religious tone that befits the movie's thematic 
STAR WARS TRILOGY: An exceptional- concerns.
