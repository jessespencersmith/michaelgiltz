8/10/2005 11:31:00 AMBush apparently isn't the only world leader who can disconnectfrom reality.The "president" of Niger -- Mamadou Tandja -- sees no famine,just foreign plots."The people of Niger look well fed, as you can see,"President Tandja says. All the talk of mass starvation is just"foreign propaganda", deception by relief agencies to obtainincreased funding. "It is only by deception that suchagencies receive funding," he tells the BBC.What problems there are, he says, "are not serious."Oh, well, that's cleared up then.
