<p>Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus and Giroux
This new mystery thriller comes from a husband and wife team based in Sweden, so naturally it's being
compared to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo . But this is really an international book written for an
international audience. It's movie ready with short chapters, vivid characters and enough twists and turnsto keep pages turning.
Many mysteries feature damaged heroes but what may give this debut novel by the pseudonym Lars
Kepler  its own flair is the fact that virtually every  character is deeply damaged in one way or another.
Our hero is Detective Joona Linna. He's haunted by a tragic car accident and now simply cannot, will not
rest until a case is solved. Linna also suffers from blinding headaches but when a case is on he skips hismeds and lets the pain mount and mount so nothing distracts from the task at hand. He's so single-minded that Linna often leaves his glamorous girlfriend alone.
Linna is dragged into solving an horrific crime in which almost an entire family is brutally murdered but
a 15 year old boy survives with hundreds of stab wounds. Time is running out because the boy's sister
may be in danger and can't be found, but the boy is is barely capable of being questioned in the normal
way. So Linna calls in...The Hypnotist.
That would be Dr. Erik Maria Bark. He swore never to use hypnosis again after some tragic event that
haunts him. (Rest assured, we'll hear about it in detail.) Bark is addicted to painkillers and not sleepingwith his beautiful wife, who hasn't forgiven him for a brief affair many years earlier. Their son is alsowounded in a way: he suffers from a rare blood disease that means he must get weekly injections and canstill die if jostled around too casually. The boy is finally dating a goth girl, who seems to be trying to pullaway from a gang of aimless youth that terrorize the kids in their neighborhood. But are his parent tooprotective to let him have any fun?
When Bark is reluctantly pressured into using hypnosis in this crisis situation, you won't be surprised to
hear it all spirals out of control. The madman who attacked that family is revealed and on the hunt. Themissing sister is found but never feels safe. Bark's use of hypnosis makes national news and AmnestyInternational weighs in on his barbaric tactics. And then the hypnotist's son is kidnapped and any one ofseveral terrifying suspects could be responsible. Soon we're plunged back into the past and Bark'scontroversial group hypnosis therapy sessions. He brought together all sorts of damaged souls, one ofwhom may be targeting him now for the sins of the past.
It's all pretty entertaining stuff, though regular readers of mysteries won't be thrown off by the red
herrings. Mind you, herring served at a Christmas party and unusual street names are the only clues thatthis is set in Sweden. Either world culture is becoming unified or this book is geared towards a worldaudience. Certainly disaffected teens and psychopaths are the same the world over. A few missteps aresoon brushed aside. (Early on, when a psycho has vowed to kill Dr. Bark and/or his family, wouldn't thecops simply go to Bark's home rather than just leave some frantic phone messages and leave it at that?)It's lean, amiable beach reading with Linna not quite center stage (much of the book is devoted to Barkand others) but an interesting character nonetheless. He has one annoyingly endearing quirk: Linna isalways right and when he's doubted and proven right, he feels compelled to make his coworkers admit hewas right and then says, "I told you so."
When this book becomes a bestseller and we get a sequel, just take it for granted that I'm thinking the
same thing: I was right and I told you so.
