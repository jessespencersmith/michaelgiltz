11/04/2004 01:17:00 PMNo, not during the election, silly. With his budget-busting ways."After four years of rapidly rising budget deficits, the Treasuryannounced on Wednesday morning that the government willborrow $147 billion in the first three months of 2005 - a newquarterly record, but one that is likely to be eclipsed before that yearis out," says the New York Times.And you thought your credit card bills were high. The article is filledwith gloomy news about the economy and our long-term fiscal health."More ominiously, said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who worked in the Bush WhiteHouse before becoming head of the Congressional Budget Office,there is little room for error. Almost any unexpected shock - a newrecession, or a new military crisis - could push budget shortageshigher than the gloomiest forecasters are predicting now."And even if Washington gets through the current uncertainties, onlyfour years remain until the oldest baby boomers start to retire andthe costs of Social Security and Medicare benefits gradually eclipsethose of every other part of the federal government."
