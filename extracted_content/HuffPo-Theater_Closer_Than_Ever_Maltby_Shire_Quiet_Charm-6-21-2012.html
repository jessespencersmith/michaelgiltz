 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Closer Than Ever  -- Maltby
& Shire's Quiet Charm
CLOSER THAN EVER  *** out of ****
YORK THEATRE COMPANY
I can still remember buying the cast album to the
original production of Closer Than Ever  in 1990 back in
Gainesville, Florida and wishing I could see the show in
New York. One year later I moved to the city and the
first show I saw was another revue, And The World Goes 'Round , a Kander and Ebb tribute. Closer  had
already closed.
For most Off Broadway revues that didn't move to Broadway, that was the end of the road for New York.
Closer Than Ever  enjoyed many regional productions over the years but it wasn't until the York Theatre
Company began its revival of Off Broadway musical works that Richard Maltby and David Shire's CloserThan Ever  had a chance to return. Now after a 15 month series of productions of shows like I'm Getting
My Act Together and Taking It On The Road,  York is climaxing the series with this new revival, directed
by Maltby himself. It's a classy finale to a bold program.
Closer Than Ever  is a musical revue that gathers together songs Maltby & Shire had written previously
for other shows (like the Broadway musical) but cut, one-offs or composed especially for this production,
all of them stored at one point or another in what Maltby called "The Urban File." These songs focused in
on middle age -- divorce, dating, kids, job insecurity, old friends, new challenges and the like.
"She Loves Me Not" follows the nice scene setter "Doors" and once probably seemed daringly funny. We
see a man yearn for his female neighbor while she has eyes only for another male neighbor while thatman has eyes only for the first guy. He's gay! Luckily, the song is nicely constructed though it might workbetter not played so broadly. Almost nothing else in the show has dated, though a few lines have beenmodestly tweaked to refer to DVRs, for example, and actors mime talking on cell phones when of coursein 1989 they didn't really even have the Internet.
"You Wanna Be My Friend" is an hilarious number where a woman tells a man breaking up with her that
the last thing she needs is a "friend." Jenn Colella brandishes a southern accent to very fun, Annie Oakleyeffect here. Christiane Noll is equally sharp on the tongue-twisting "The Bear, the Tiger, the Hamster andthe Mole," in which a woman extolls the many possibilities of mating found in nature (most of them doMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>FOLLOW ENTERTAINMENTno bode well for the male). And the comic high point is "There's Nothing Like It," a very fun lament
about exercise in which the entire cast has a blast acting out their aches and pains and the frustration
over Jane Fonda's workout (a dated reference they wisely retained).
More serious numbers appear, such as Sal Viviano's high point "One Of The Good Guys," a quiet tune
about not cheating on your wife and the strength and satisfaction that provides. And Noll handles the
roller coaster of "Life Story" nicely.
The first act ends strongly but as with so many shows, I always wonder if an intermission is helpful.
Closer Than Ever was expanded from a one act revue but I can't help thinking it would maintain itsmomentum and be stronger without the interval and the removal of four or five songs that don't play aswell as the others.
The tech elements are strong with a clean but elegant scenic design by James Morgan as a highlight.
Maltby directs smoothly and turns the four actors (and two musicians who each get a turn in the
spotlight) into a true ensemble. Inevitably, however tightly knit the group, you find your favorites and
here the women outshine the men. George Dvorsky is a funny, engaging presence in act one but falters a
bit in act two with several lesser tunes at his disposal. Noll has a voice perfect for the pop operas that
dominated in the 1980s but modulates herself nicely and shines throughout. Viviano, I'm afraid, is the
notable weak link. His voice isn't remotely as strong as the others and his onstage presence repeatedly
has a supper theatre air that surely he and Maltby were not going for.
The first among equals is the marvelous Colella. I was lucky enough to see her hilariously out-there turn
as the star of the New York Musical Theater Festival show Kiki Baby  for which she deservedly won a top
award and thought, "Who the heck is that?" My first impression has been fully borne out here for thisstar of Broadway's Urban Cowboy  and High Fidelity  and numerous more successful Off Broadway
shows. Every time she returns to the stage, you smile. She nails the comic number of "Miss Byrd," thesexiness of "Back On Base" and any time there's a group number your eyes are drawn to her. She is onechoice part away from Broadway stardom (or a sitcom hit). Isn't that precisely why you go to revues -- todive into the catalog of an artist and maybe discover a talent you'll want to follow for years to come?
I love Maltby & Shire when they're in their quiet, observant, wry mode. They are the Cheever and Updike
of musical theater. (What they could do with Rabbit, Run! ) I find them consistently less engaging when
going for the big Broadway moment, for songs of sentiment and large emotion. That may be why I was
less taken with act two, which believes it is building emotionally by including numbers like "If I Sing" (in
which a musician celebrates the love of music he learned from his father) and the similarly dramatic"Patterns" and "Fathers Of Fathers." But, in fact, it's the quieter and funnier numbers that are packedwith emotion, the sort that sneaks up on you when you're not expecting it. When they don't strive for thebig notes, Maltby and Shire are closer than ever to reaching them.
