 Letters to His Neighbor
Letters to His Neighbor
by Marcel Proust, Lydia Davis
Price: $22.95 (Hardcover)
Published: August 22, 2017
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: Marcel Proust’s genius for illuminating pain is on
spectacular display in this recently discovered trove of his correspondence,
Letters to His Neighbor. Already suffering from noise within his cork-lined
walls, his poor soul was not ready for the fresh hell when his neighbor Dr.Williams married a widow with small children. Chiefly to Mrs. Williams,these ever-polite letters (often accompanied by flowers, compliments,
books, even pheasants) are frequently hilarious—Proust couches his fury in
a gracious tone. In Lydia Davis’s hands, the digressive brilliance of hissentences shines: “Don't speak of annoying neighbors, but of neighbors socharming (an association of words contradictory in principle sinceMontesquiou claims that most horrible of all are 1) neighbors 2) the smell
of post offices) that they leave the constant tantalizing regret that one
cannot take advantage of their neighborliness.” Proust makes finedistinctions among his auditory torments: “The valet de chambre makesnoise and that doesn't matter. But later he knocks with little tiny raps.  
And that is worse.” Lydia Davis has written a generous translator’s note,tracing much of what we can know about Proust’s perpetually dark room;she details the furnishings as well as the life he lived there: burning hispowders, talking with friends, hiring musicians, and, most of all, suffering.Letters to His Neighbor is richly illustrated with facsimile letters and
photographs—catnip for lovers of Proust. With an Introduction by Jean-
Yves Tadié and a translator’s note by Lydia Davis

<p>Proust finding them of interest. Since I am indeed a fan of Proust and read all 4,200 pages of his masterwork (and never fail
to take advantage of the opportunity to mention that fact), for me this book breezed by. Surprises abound. For example,
who knew Proust could be succinct? (Some of his letters are quite brief.) On the other hand, I'm not surprised in the least
that Proust is a difficult neighbor, apologizing ever so profusely while he complains for the thousandth time about the noiseof a neighbor's servants or workmen or countless other indignities. Could not perhaps the neighbor's servants ascertain whenProust's servants plan to beat their rugs outdoors and time it so all are beaten at once? And the ever-ailing Proust wondersif perhaps they could ask the workmen to do nothing on Friday because Proust is daring to venture outdoors that evening
and it will take an entire day of tomb-like silence for the great man to even consider the hazards of a dinner engagement
without faltering at the start. Again, it's all quite amusing and his letters entertain, especially in the nimble translation byLydia Davis. Maybe if we read the responses of his neighbor this very brief work might feel a bit more substantial. But as is,it's a minor amusement that cannot bear the scrutiny of standing on its own. -- Michael Giltz
