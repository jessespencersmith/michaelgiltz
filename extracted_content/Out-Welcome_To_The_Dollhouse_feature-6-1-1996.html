Surviving 
the Seventh 
Grade 
N WRITER-DIRECTOH Todd Solondz's bit­
terly funny· Welcome to the Dollhouse . 
(Sony Pictures Classics), 1 I-year-old 
Dawn Weiner endures a seventh grade 
gauntlet of taunts and abuse from her 
schoolmates, a swooning crush on an 
older boy, and rough come-ons from the 
school delinquent. Anyone who has ever 
felt different or rejected will cringe in 
sympathy when the gawky Dawn 
(played by Heather Matarazzo) is called 
"pig-face" and "dyke." Dawn's only friend is 
Ralphy, a sweet little boy who's probably gay. 
She defends him from the others but-thjs 
being real life-when they fight, she calls him 
a faggot herself. 
When the nebbishy and articulate 
Solondz gets together with his now 13-year­
old star at a Manhattan coffee shop to com­
pare notes on school and their movie (open­
ing on May 24), Matarazzo makes it clear that the art of name-calling still flourishes in the eighth 
grade. "They call them 'faggot,'" she says, cataloguing the insults. "They call them 'retard.' They 
call them 'a-hole.' And now I'm like, 'Would you knock it of!'? You don't know what you're doing 
to this person. You're tearing apart their soul with these words that you think are, like, funny. '" 
Solondz's childhood wasn't quite so gallant. "Me standing up in front of all the bullies? Are 
you kidding? I think I was more like the character Troy," he says, referring to a smart, nerdy boy 
who's punched around by some older kids. "But the difference between him and me is that I was 
much faster. So I actually never did get beaten up." 
Welcome to the Dollhouse is rated R because of its frank language- language the director 
knew was necessary to show how kids talk. "Certain words are permissible ," says Solondz, who's 
straight. "People don't go around calling Jews 'kikes' and so on, but 'faggot' is totally part and 
parcel of the accepted vocabulary. That double standard is something gays live with." 
Almost as bad as being taunted is being ignored, which is what happened to Solondz's first 
film, Fear. Anxiety, and Depression (1989). The director turned his back on two Hollywood stu­
dio development deals and taught English as a second language for five years before deciding to 
give independent filmmaking one more shot with Doll/wus e. So far, so good: The feature won the 
top prize at January's Sundance Film Festival. 
Meanwhil e, Matarazzo's biggest worry is making sure no one at school thinks she's stuck up 
just because she made a movie. And she's got her future mapped out. "I told Mom I'm going to 
Yale and then I'm moving to the East Village." Solondz spends much of the meal listening admir­
ingly to her talk about gay people ("They're still a person; it doesn't matter what sex they like") 
and the serious issues raised by his very funny movie. When everyone gets ready to leave, Patti 
Smith is singing "Gloria" on Matarazzo's Walkman, and Solondz says. "You're much cooler than 
I'll ever be." He's probably right-just don't let her friends hear him say that.-MlcHA EL GILTZ
