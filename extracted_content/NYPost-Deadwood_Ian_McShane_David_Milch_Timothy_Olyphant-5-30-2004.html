'Deadwood' villain curses a blue 
streak and steals the show 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
P0TrY-MOUTHED characters drop 
four-letter words all over cable­
TVlitter rhe cable-TV these days -
but few relish their utterance like Al 
Swearengen, the coldly violent saloon own­
er on HBO's "Deadwood." Based on a real­
life person, the character is so gleefully pro­
fane he frequently tells his whores to earn 
their keep with a simple, "Get f****in'!' 
The aptly named Swearengen doesn't 
only talk the talk. He radiates menace. He 
beats his whores, plots the murder of an 
angelic little girl who could complicate his 
plans and taunts the town sheriff. 
As Swearengen, British actor Ian 
McShane is stealing rhe show from his 
more famous (and hyped) co-stars such as 
like Keith Carra dine as Wild Bill Hickok, 
Powers Boothe as a rival saloon owner and 
Timothy Olyphant as sheriff Seth Bullock. 
HThat guy is turning cartwheels," says co­
star Olyphant . "It's really amazing to watch." 
Ironically, McShane, best known in 
America for his role, in the mid-1980s, as an 
antiques dealer/amateur sleuth in the PBS 
series "Lovejoy," almost didn't get the part. 
"He was not my first thought," admits 
"Deadwood" creator David Milch, "But he 
sure took it, didn't he?" 
For McShane, it's the fIlet mignon of roles, 
"The devil gets the best tunes," admits 
McShane, 61, and he should know -he 
played the Jack Nicholson role of the devil 
opposite Lucie Arnaz in the recent London 
musical, "The Witches of Eastwick." 
Born in Blackburn, England, McShane is 
rhe son of a Rarry McShane, a famous Man­
chester United footballer. Growing up, Just the facts 
I IAN McSHANE 
• Children: Kate, born in ill!.. 
and Morgan, born in 1975 ... 
• Breakthrough rolruas. 
Heathcliff in a TV miniseries 
of "Wuthe-ring Heights.". 
• Location, location: 
"OeadwoOd" Is filmed at 
Melody RanOh, home of 
singing cowboy Gene Autry. 
• Profit Margin: "AI 
Swearengen was making 
$5,000 a day from his 
saloon,"says ",cSh~e-
young Ian knew a lot about dealing with 
fame but very little about rhe arts. 
"I didn't come into acting because I had 
imaginary friends when I was five and built 
little theaters, you know," says McShane, 
with a laugh. "I had a teacher at school who 
1 still keep in contact wirh. He put me in 
this play when I was 15. It was 'Nekrassov' 
by Sartre, the first amateur production 
done in England outside of the Royal Court 
Theater. God knows why." 
That led Shane to take the lead in "Cyra­
no De Bergerac," in a production so good it 
almost toured England. McShane was ready 
to head back to the football field, but his 
teacher convinced him to pursue acting. 
McShane auditioned for the Royal Acade­
my of Dramatic Arts, got in, and has never looked back, even though that first day at 
school was quite a shock. 
"The first person I met was a gay, black 
Jamaican," says McShane . "I was from Man­
chester, where you didn't meet a lot of gay 
people. Or black people." 
McShane has worked steadily throughout 
ills career, played everything from Judas in 
Franco Zeffirelli's film "Jesus of Nazareth" 
to a gangster in "Sexy Beast" with Ben 
Kingsley. Along rhe way there were three 
marriages , two children, and a drinking 
problem he fmally licked after "Lovejoy." 
"I hit my bottom then," says McShane, 
who has been married to actress Gwen 
Humble since 1981. "We did the show in '85. 
It was one of the first independent co-pro-ductions. I came back here to L.A. and 
decided to stop all that drinking. I stopped 
smoking, too. There's norhing left." 
Nothing except rhe work, which should 
multiply even more as ills performance in 
"Deadwood," already renewed for a second 
season, continues to garner raves. Though 
Milch has the stories mapped out for the 
next five years, he's always ready to adapt 
to what the actors bring to their roles. 
"Milch gave me heftier monologues as 
the show went on," says McShane. "Some­
times I'll hear the fax machine kick on in 
the other room and think, 'Here we go!'"
