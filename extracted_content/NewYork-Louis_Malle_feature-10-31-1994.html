            <p>Retrvpeclive lieHlng Perspective 
French director Louis Malle-who will turn 62 this Sun足
day-has followed a decidedly idiosyncratic career path. 
Beginning with an underwater feature he co-directed with 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau (The Silent Worldl, he's tackled thrillers 
(Frantic), India in a seven-part TV documentarY (Phantom 
India), the American dream (Atlantic CityJ, philosophy (My Din足
ner With Andrej, and, 
most recently, Chekhov 
(Uncle Vanya on 42nd 
Street). A Symphony 
Space retrospective is 
double-billing a Malle 
film with a French clas足
sic. "Some of them," 
Malle says, "I'm almost 
embarrassed to have 
my film next to them 
because they're so 
great." Like May Fools 
with Jean Renoir's The 
Rules of the Game? 
"That's the one I was 
thinking of," he admits. 
"When I was doing May 
Fools, it was my little 
homage to Renoir and that movie. The old lady who dies at the 
beginning is Paulette Dubost, who played the maid in The Rules 
of the Game. So there is a connection; except, you know, Rules 
is one of the great masterpieces of the cinema." And, of course, 
even the idea of a retrospective can be off-putting to a director 
looking ahead to his next project. "It's like when people come 
to you and they say, 'Oh, you made that film; that's a great film.' 
And they talk about the first one I made, when I was 24. That 
happened to me yesterday, and that makes you feel tenible," he 
laughs. "[What about) everything I've done since?"
