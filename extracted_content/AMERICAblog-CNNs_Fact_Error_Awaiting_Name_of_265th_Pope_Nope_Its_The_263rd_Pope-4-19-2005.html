4/19/2005 12:29:00 PMThis confusion arises because Benedict IX held the office ofbishop of Rome on three separate occasions in the eleventhcentury. Therefore, there have been 264 pontificates, if youwill, but only 262 Popes counting from Peter to John Paul II. Sowhomever is named today will be the 263rd man to becomePope. Just one quick way to impress your friends courtesy ofAmericablog. (MSNBC makes the same mistake and Fox Newsavoids naming a number, at least on its scroll.)
