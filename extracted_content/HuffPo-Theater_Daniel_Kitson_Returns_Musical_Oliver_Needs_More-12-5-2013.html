ST.  ANN'S  WAREHOUSE
Daniel Kitson is a stand-up comic when he's not being a monologist when he's not being
an artiste, the sort of word that would perhaps get under his skin unless he recognized theirony of it as pertaining to his work since it is in fact artistry of a very high order but onethat effortlessly avoids pretensions.
He broke through here in the US -- or to be more precise, he broke through for me -- with
the "story show" The  Interminable  Suicide  Of  Gregory  Church,  a remarkable one-man
show that displayed Kitson's talents at their finest. It was funny, smart, enjoyablyconvoluted, quirky and quite heart-on-its-sleeve emotional. I was gobsmacked and I cansay that because I'm British but really I grew up in America so I should just say it wasamazing and made me an immediate and intense fan.
I saw his next "story show" -- as opposed to one of his stand-up performances -- which
was It's  Always  Right  Now,  Until  It's  Later.  Again we saw several seemingly unrelated
storylines converge and we reveled in Kitson's unique stage presence. He stutters at times,plays off momentary quirks in that evening's performance and generally creates an air ofspontaneity despite his shows being carefully crafted, Rube Goldberg-type constructionswith various time lines and characters that come together with a flourish a la thatcinematic trope seen in Amores  Perros  and Babel  and the like. It covered some of the
same territory but he was still fresh enough to me so it too was one of my favorite showsof the year.
His stand up act is of a very similar vein, free-flowing and quick-witted and the best of its
kind since Eddie Izzard (which is to say, that it's not like Izzard at all and that Izzard isnot like others -- they are unique talents, which is how they are alike).
Looking through his credits online I see we've only caught a sliver of his output so far,
which now extends to a tentative doubling of people onstage via a two-person show thathas been done in the hinterlands of the UK. I fear with his new show that we're seeingKitson stuck in a bit of a rut, working with structure and outside techniques because hefears repeating himself. That may be entirely unfair and I back into it because I have lovedhis work so much -- the little I've seen -- and honestly can't wait to see him push himselfand do more.
But here we are again with Analog.ue,  another show very similar to the last two. It has
two central characters who are seemingly unconnected but eventually converge in some
way. It's funny and sharp and has some wonderfully vivid and sad vignettes, details that

<p>stay with you. In 1977, Thomas is sitting in his garage at the behest of his wife. An elderly
man, Thomas has been receiving audio equipment from his wife as a running gag for
decades and she's been insisting with increasing vehemence that he record stories of hislife, put it all out there. Now, finally, on this fateful day, Thomas is doing so.
Far into the future, a lonely woman named Gertie leads a quiet, barren existence,
answering the phones at a business, eating her yogurt in a darkened closet on her breaksand obsessed with the voice of Thomas she heard on a recording machine Gertie found asa child. Kitson jumps back and forth between these two lives and every time he announcesthe year: Thomas is recording in 1977, it's so-and-so year and Gertie is this many yearsold. A little math let's us realize that Gertie was born the year Thomas made his tapes. Isshe his granddaughter? Was she born on the day he made these audio records of his life,ramblings and amusings that would interest almost no one? Quietly, these storiesconverge as they have before with Kitson.
None of this is to indicate the way  these stories are told. In fact, they aren't told at all,
since Kitson doesn't say a word. The cavernous performance space is mostly dark, with a
small desk under a light. Then a bright light way way in the back comes on and we seeKitson next to a jumble of old audio equipment of various types. He comes forward withone, plugs it in, sets the machine on the ground with a wire trailing to the desk and
presses play. We get a taped introduction with Kitson explaining that he's going to tell the
story by hauling out various pieces of equipment and hopefully turning one off and
pressing another one on at just the right time so the story can move forward. And so hedoes. Occasionally, Kitson offers a modest bit of physical interplay but mostly he's movingback and forth, an attendant more than a performer. Soon the floor around the desk
features a scattering of reel to reels and cassette decks and the like. It's like an audio
octopus, with Kitson's recorded voices coming out of the near darkness and blinking red
and green lights letting us know which machine is "speaking" at the moment. It's a bit likewatching Janet Cardiff  construct one of her audio installations  right in front of you.
To be sure, it's a technical challenge -- which machine do you grab next? when do youpress play? -- but it's more art piece than live theater. The varying levels of sound and
audio quality give each machine its own sense of character and vary the listening
experience for the audience. It's an interesting concept, but it robs Kitson's show of their
strongest suit: Kitson himself. He's a thoroughly engaging actor and while the briefmoments that he improvises in other shows are surely just that -- brief -- he is engaginglyalive and bristling with intelligence in a way that makes you sit up and pay notice. Butthat spontaneity is lacking in a pre-recorded performance done in bits and pieces and theshow suffers for it. And it doesn't mask the very similar nature of this story to the othersI've seen. Now there's nothing wrong with doing this type of tale for the rest of his life:John Ford made a lot of westerns and John Updike didn't suddenly start writing about thepoor of Eastern Europe, did he? But there is immense variety within these genres,characters that surprise and delight us. Kitson can do that and will do it again, butmessing with how a story is presented does not grapple with the story itself. If his twoperson play simply breaks up the two characters whose lives converge, with one actorreciting one monologue and the other one the other without them actually interacting,then it won't really be a radical break either.
I still found the show intellectually and to a degree emotionally engaging. A critic is not a
reporter but two people I urged to come were baffled by the dates and convoluted telling,as was a friend who had seen Kitson several times before. I found the story crystal clearthough apparently I may just be confused: I've also seen the woman in the separate storydescribed as his daughter, though that seems impossible given his age and what we knowby the end of the show. (Perhaps I got my dates wrong?) Apparently others were confusedor distracted by the performance style as well. I had imagined Kitson might use therecordings to interact with other voices without having the bother of dealing with othervoices, that is, other actors. Perhaps he'll tackle this idea again in another show and usethe various taped bits not to create technical challenges for himself but to embrace thecreative challenges it can offer for his storytelling. He is indeed a storyteller and I'm eagerto hear the next one soon.</p>
<p>OLIVER!  ** out of ****
PAPERMILL  PLAYHOUSE
The Papermill Playhouse was the original home for Newsies  and apparently they have an
endless supply of chorus boys who can sing and dance. Guys both young, teenaged and
older fill the stage in this holiday presentation of Oliver!,  the musical based on the
Dickens novel Oliver  Twist.  It's a good-natured show brimming with some of the shakiest
British accents this side of Dick Van Dyke. But the musical numbers by Lionel Bartcouldn't be catchier and it's one of the handsomest productions the Papermill has evercreated.
You probably know the story, though I'd never seen it on stage and barely remember the
movie so it was pretty new to me. Oliver is a sad but adorable orphan who has thetemerity to ask for more gruel one mealtime. Astonished at such a trouble maker, Oliver issoon whisked away by his betters and sold to a family of undertakers. They taunt him,their assistant taunts him and soon Oliver runs away. He's taken in by a gang ofpickpockets led by the greedy Fagin and the equally adorable rapscallion known as theArtful Dodger. Oliver bungles his first job and is arrested only to be rescued by the manwhose pocket he picked. In a twist even Dickens should have been ashamed of, it turns out
Oliver is the long-lost nephew (or in this production grandson, I think) of the wealthy
gentleman. But the underworld worries Oliver might reveal their lair and his good luck
isn't about to last, not when the vicious Bill Sykes is around. Will Oliver find a real home?Will Bill ever stop beating the barmaid Nancy? The only sure bet is that the catchy songswill never stop.
All the tech elements of this show are top-notch. The sets by Mark Morton are Broadwayworthy, creating a vivid sense of the orphanage, the lair of criminals, the wealthy side oftown and always a sense of the bustling London in which these adventures are set. Dittothe excellent costumes by Amanda Seymour, which feel specific to the period but neithertoo colorful (which makes them look like costumes) nor too raggedy (which makes themdistracting). They feel authentic in a very pleasing way. The lighting, the sound, the hairand wigs all contribute as well in a show that looks even better than Newsies , the most
famed transfer from Papermill in recent years. Most importantly, the music supervisorand conductor Craig Barna has an orchestra sounding just terrific, also at Broadway-levelquality. It's a wonderful frame for the story and the actors.
Unfortunately, director Mark S. Hoebee has the cast pitched to a very broad style indeed.
It ain't Shakespeare but these stories are usually funnier and more enjoyable when thecharacters take them seriously.</p>
<p>Of course the hardest parts to cast are the children, specifically Oliver and the Artful
Dodger. Tyler Moran plays our hero and unfortunately doesn't sing very well or hold the
stage as an actor. He has great trouble with enunciation (the accent certainly doesn't help)and the scenes in the rich man's home were especially garbled and painful to watch. In
fairness, Oliver as a character does virtually nothing in this telling of the tale. I doubt even
Laurence Olivier as a child could do much with it. Oliver's a pawn pushed around by
others. He has no opportunity to be brave or true, to stick up for someone weaker thanhim or win us by some deed or plucky spirit. He's simply a rather anonymous boy andonly an actor with tremendous charisma can make it even a decent part. Plus, his bignumber "Where Is Love?" is an exceptionally difficult song for a child to sing. EthanHaberfield has better luck as the Artful Dodger...but only when singing and dancing. Thenhis confidence and personality come through. When he has to talk, Haberfield has anaccent that feels more like a spoof of British accents.
The adults are better. Fagin should be a show stopper, though, not just better than child
performers who fall short. David Garrison avoids the caricatures that plagued Fagin in thepast, but his scenes slip by smoothly rather than popping out with menace and charm. Farbetter is John Treacy Egan as Mr. Bumble and Jessica Sheridan as the Widow Corney.Their banter and playfulness strikes the right balance of fun and seriousness. Best of allare Betsy Morgan as Nancy and Jose Llana as Bill. He has good presence and is especiallystrong in his opening number "My Name." She's even more of a knockout, making themost of a tough as nails broad with a heart of gold who gets to sing rousing numbers like"It's A Fine Life," "Oom-Pah-Pah" and her ballad "As Long As He Needs Me." I hope tosee her again soon.
And it seems endemic to the show, but the finale is awfully rushed. Here Nancy dies, Bill
is shot (I couldn't even see by whom) and the show comes to a halt without even a finalreprise of a big number. Then Fagin abruptly decides to give his precious jewels to theDodger and mend his ways, but a stray bit of diamond bring out his greed all over again?And that's it? Surely the reunion of Oliver and his relatives begs for a reprise of "Consider
Yourself" since Oliver really has  finally found his home and the Artful Dodger had one all
along with the mercenary Fagin. It seems inconceivable the show just ends like that,
without a song.
Of course this is the holiday show at Papermill so that means a curtain call where they do
reprise a show's number and then launch into a holiday carol while snow falls from theceiling in an annual tradition that fits in with Oliver!  quite nicely.
And though an Oliver!  without a strong Oliver or Dodger or vivid Fagin can only do so
much, the parade of catchy, effective numbers delivered well by a strong orchestracertainly makes for a pleasant evening. "Food, Glorious Food," "Boy For Sale," thememorable act two "Who Will Buy?' and "Pick A Pocket Or Two" are just some of thetreats on offer. It's enough to make you go out and buy a cast album.
