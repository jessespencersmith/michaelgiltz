            <p>S AT U R D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6"You Make The Sun Shine Brighter Than DorisDay"That's one of my favorite lyrics(it comes from Wham's "WakeMe Up (Before You Go Go)." Butof course no one makes the sunshine brighter than Doris Day.She's always been an exceptionalsinger overshadowed by hercheery image. But still, I'venever paid much attention toher. So what possessed me tobuy The Love Album -- her final studio album which remainedunrealeased for about 40 years? But darned if it isn't pretty great, withDay delivering subtle, engaging covers of standards like "For All WeKnow" and "All Alone." Her disarming approach reminds me of PeggyLee, another singer who doesn't seem to be striving to do much at alluntil she breaks your heart. I can't agree with noted jazz vocalist expertWill Friedwald, who claims in the liner notes that Day's version of theJoni Mitchell classic "Both Sides Now" is the greatest version of thatsong ever recorded. (It's good, but the arrangement dates it a bit.) Butwhen he compares Day to Ella Fitzgerald, Rosemary Clooney and Lee,it's hard to argue.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
