8/19/2005 04:23:00 PMWomen: Supreme Court Nominee John Roberts is apparentlyno friend of you. And Ted Kennedy makes two very salientpoints: Kennedy makes clear the Senate MUST have relevantdocuments from 16 cases Roberts handled as deputy solicitorgeneral from 1989 to 1993; they are important, the Americanpeople have the right to see them, there is precedent forseeing them and they will illuminate the thinking of Roberts.Kennedy also says that Roberts -- from everything we haveseen -- puts his own personal agenda ahead of the law, noteven seeing the right to vote as something that should bedefended with vigor. As Kennedy says in a Washington Postop-ed column:Specifically, and contrary to the intent of overwhelmingmajorities in both the House and the Senate, it appearsthat Roberts proposed a very narrow and crabbedinterpretation of the Voting Rights Act that wouldessentially eviscerate the meaning of that law. Fortunately,his view did not prevail. But if a nominee to the SupremeCourt believes in such a strained and narrow interpretationof such a fundamental right, then I believe he is notqualified to serve in that important position.Kennedy says Roberts was out of the mainstream and unless Robertsshows his thinking has evolved from that young Reagan warrior, heshould not be given the privilege of a lifetime appointment on theSupreme Court.No one has an automatic right to a lifetime position on theSupreme Court. A nominee to the high court must firstdemonstrate that he has a core commitment toconstitutional rights and liberties.... Judge Roberts's earlyrecord raises serious questions about his commitment tocore constitutional values, and the Senate must have therequested information to fully and faithfully execute itsconstitutional obligation.
