MoreCosbyby Mark WhitakerPrice: $29.99(Hardcover)Published: September 16, 2014Rating: 0.0/5 (0 votes cast)From the Publisher: The first major biography of an Americanicon, comedian Bill Cosby. Based on extensive research and in-depth interviews with Cosby and more than sixty of his closestfriends and associates, it is a frank, fun and fascinating account ofhis life and historic legacy. Far from the gentle worlds of hisroutines or TV shows, Cosby grew up in a Philadelphia housingproject, the son of an alcoholic, largely absent father and a lovingbut overworked mother. With novelistic detail, award winningjournalist Mark Whitaker tells the story of how, after dropping out ofhigh school, Cosby turned his life around by joining the Navy,talking his way into college, and seizing his first breaks as a stand-up comedian. Published on the 30th anniversary of The CosbyShow, the book reveals the behind-the-scenes story of thatgroundbreaking sitcom as well as Cosby’s bestselling…Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This Book

Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayBill Cosby's impact on popular culture is extraordinary and this solid, fascinating biography tells his story well.Journalist Mark Whitaker is clearly admiring of Cosby, but manages to deliver a somewhat warts-and-all look despiteextensive cooperation from the star and his many associates over the years. It does address extra-marital affairs in astraight-forward manner but makes no mention of rape allegations and an out of court settlement against one suchaccuser in 2006; in essence, this is an unofficially approved biography. It's very strong in fleshing out Cosby'schildhood and years in the military but really hits its stride as Cosby rockets to success. In recent years, the trend inautobiographies of show business figures has been a focus on the years before they made it big (such as SteveMartin's excellent memoir). "Cosby" shows the years after you make it can also be fascinating. Cosby's struggles withcensors and studios, the constant seesawing in how he was perceived both by white and black audiences and howhis first attempts to capitalize on fame with a production company bankrupted him are all spelled out. The hugeimpact of "I Spy," his ground-breaking work on "Fat Albert" and "The Electric Company," the ahead of its time sitcom"The Bill Cosby Show," his innovative work as a spokesperson for various products and of course "The Cosby Show"and its seismic success are all covered in depth. And throughout it all, Whitaker threads his work as a stand-up,showing how Cosby shapes his material and why that has been the lifeblood of his career despite the hit films andrecord-breaking TV shows. The book provides some good cultural context but never quite scales the heights ofgreatness the way its subject did. Still, it gets the job done and reveals a career and talent that is truly singular. It willsurely be snapped up by fans and send others back to his seminal comedy albums and lesser known projects. --MIchael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“A smart, revealing biography of an iconic American funnyman. . . .
