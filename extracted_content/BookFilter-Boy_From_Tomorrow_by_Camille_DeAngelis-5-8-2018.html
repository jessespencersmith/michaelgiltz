<p>escape her prison and Alec to make a friend for real. This modest middle grade novel begins simply and engagingly. But
author Camille DeAngelis piles on the melodrama and doesn't play fair. If Josie's mom is a fraud, why isn't she more
astonished upon discovering her daughter is talking with a boy from the future? Alec's dad on the other hand seems to have
done nothing worse than divorce his mom, but Alec is overwhelmed even though divorce is not usually the trauma it oncewas. So while Josie deals with her mother's creepily suspicious assistant, a staff completely indifferent to the almost brutaltreatment of Josie and her sister AND a snoopy schoolmate who just wants to pry out secrets about her mother, Alec simplymakes trips to the library and has a school pal who behaves decently from the start. The excitement is decidedly weighted
to the past even though the chapters alternate between them. Worse, DeAngelis plays fast and loose with the magic taking
place.When the ouija board becomes inaccessible, Josie and Alec simply switch to a phonograph playing wax cylinders sothey can chat away, which feels awfully convenient. And while one doesn't need an explanation as such for every strangegoings-on, what the heck is up with that possessed doll anyway? With lazy magic rule-making, a confused jumble ofelements and a climactic plot twist that feels too easy, "The Boy From Tomorrow" wears out its welcome long before that
creepy doll loses an eye. -- Michael Giltz
