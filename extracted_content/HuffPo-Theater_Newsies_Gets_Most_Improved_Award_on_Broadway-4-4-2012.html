 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Newsies  Gets "Most
Improved" Award on Broadway
NEWSIES  ** 1/2 out of ****
NEDERLANDER THEATRE
The Disney musical Newsies  has moved from the
Papermill Playhouse  in New Jersey to Broadway with
style. In every way, the show has been focused and
improved both in the staging, the dancing, the songs and
the performances. It's an instant smash that has sold outevery performance (you can bet they'll extend the show
again beyond its limited run through August) and is sure
to battle Once  for the Best Musical Tony. It's still not a great show but it's amiable, family friendly fare
and, given the immediate acclaim for its Papermill run, they are to be commended for doing the work to
make this show better. ( You can check out my original review here. )
The story is simple: Jack Kelly (a star-making turn by Jeremy Jordan) is the best newsie around atselling papers. When Jospeh Pulitzer decides to squeeze out more profits by raising his prices for the ladswho actually sell his paper, Jack is prodded into action and leads the boys on a strike. It soon spreads toall five boroughs and becomes a "children's crusade" that highlights all the kids who should be in schoolor having fun but instead slave away under terrible conditions. Jack has right on his side... as well as apretty and eager new reporter Katherine (a winning Kara Lindsay) who -- would you believe it? -- mightjust be falling for the handsome Jack.
Dubbed " Annie  with boys," this is essentially a dance show with a chomping at the bit cast of young
actors dashing and dancing across the stage in one big number after another. If you wonder whether the
kids will prevail, you've never seen a Disney film. Ben Fankhauser and Andrew Keenan-Bolger are thestandouts in the biggest and best supporting roles, but these Dead End dancers impress up and down theline. They're also more ethnically diverse, which feels right for turn of the century New York. This ain'tShakespeare and they're having fun.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>The out of the way Nederlander on 41st Street is a good fit for Newsies , just like it was for the long-
running Rent . An underdog show like this fits right in with this smaller Broadway house. That intimacy
makes the show feel more personal and fun than the grand space of the Papermill, which is bigger than
most Broadway spaces. With months of rehearsal and performance under their belt, the dancing is far
tighter and focused now, showing off the energetic choreography of Christopher Gattelli to good effect.
When Annie  arrives in the fall, Broadway will be employing more young actors than a dozen seasons of
The Mickey Mouse Club.  Who knows what stars will emerge?
Some have suggested Disney planned to move the show to Broadway all along. (Do they do anything on asmall scale? Not usually.) Still, it seems likely they expected the show to just tour and create a valuableproperty for high schools and regional companies down the road. Otherwise, surely they would havelocked in star Jeremy Jordan and kept him on ice in case the "secret" plan to hit Broadway came tofruition. Instead, he had Newsies  in New Jersey and then jumped right into Broadway's Bonnie & Clyde .
It's to his and Disney's good luck that show closed quickly enough for Jordan to jump right back into
Newsies , making him one of the rare actors (if not only  actors) to create two original parts in new
musicals in the same Broadway season. Jordan looks like a charismatic Broadway star of the future,
assuming movies and TV don't snap him up for a while. He has excellent chemistry with Lindsay, who
remains a better actor than singer. Their back and forth is the most mature and fully realized element of
the show. A much-needed second act duet -- "Something to Believe In" -- is one of the show's bestadditions.
Other changes include a song for the villain of the piece, Pulitzer, and a new song for Jack's friend and
theater owner Medda ("That's Rich"). Helen Anker was one of the best performers in the originalproduction but it left audiences confused as to her exact relationship with Jack, muddying the waters ofhis budding romance. Recasting it with the big and brassy Capathia Jenkins and giving her a light-hearted song about money was a wise move. Frankly, Jack would still be lucky to have learned a few extralessons from Medda, but it's clear now she's a mother figure for the lad.
None of the three new numbers match the originals from the movie, like "Santa Fe." But they do keep the
second act from seeming like one long reprise of numbers from the first act, the way the show did in its
original incarnation. Harvey Fierstein doubtless tightened the book in numerous small ways. And
director Jeff Calhoun keeps the show moving smoothly and with a better focus.
This show always seemed a likely favorite for the road producers to tout as a potential winner of Best
Musical. It's a family friendly name brand show. Now Newsies  is also better.
