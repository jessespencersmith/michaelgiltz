4/26/2005 04:02:00 PMSo make up your minds already. Scalia et al yelled andscreamed when other Justices mentioned in one ruling thatvirtually every country in the world refuses to kill the mentallyretarded and minors.But now, in another ruling, Scalia and Thomas insist it'sperfectly fine to pay attention to the legal rulings of courtsoverseas. A man filling out a form said he'd never been foundguilty of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison by"any court." His lawyers argued that "any court" meant simplyany US court and not any court in the world, so he was fine tonot mention his conviction in Japan. Today the Supreme Courtagreed.But in a dissent, Scalia and Thomas and Kennedy said thestatutes were clear and that the man's conviction in Japanmeant he was prohibited from possessing a gun in the US. I'msure the NRA will denounce Scalia as an activist judge trying toput our country under the thumb of foreign leaders, right?Either you can take international law into consideration or youcan't, so they need to make up their minds and get a littleconsistency.In this particular case, it seems not unreasonable. But imagine:you fight for human rights and democracy in China and getjailed for five years and then you move to the US and gettreated like a criminal? Is that what Scalia wants to do? Givethe dictatorial rulings of commies the same weight as aconviction in Texas? Outrageous! Dang activist justices.
