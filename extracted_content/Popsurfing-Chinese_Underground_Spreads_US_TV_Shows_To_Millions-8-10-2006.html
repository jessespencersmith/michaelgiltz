            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  A U G U S T  1 0 ,  2 0 0 6Chinese Underground Spreads US TV Shows ToMillionsA fun, fascinating article about Chinese people who donate their timeto creating high quality subtitles for US TV shows like "DesperateHousewives" and then spread them on the Internet. Lots of interestingangles: naturally, their worldview and attitudes towards democracyand the US are positively influenced even by innocuous shows like"Friends." Chinese censors cut out all the good stuff from officialbroadcasts and program them in awkward hours so people won't watch-- for example, they cut out the scene where the kid came out on"Housewives," which must have mightily confused viewers. There's alsoan hilarious assessment of Chinese-made TV shows: “Our own actorsare not bad. Those responsible for making Chinese TV shows patheticare the directors, screenwriters, editors and the people doing thelighting, music, special effects and makeup. There are bits of poorquality in every aspect, and it adds up to total trash.” Ouch! Finally,there's a moronic spokesperson for the movie studios who says theyhope Chinese authorities crack down on these people. That's right,almost no US TV shows can be seen in China, so these people (who doit just for the love of the shows) aren't costing US studios a penny, andthey're spreading a love for US TV shows and our country anddemocracy in general. And this schmuck is siding with the evil dictatorsof China and calling for them to throw these people in jail.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
