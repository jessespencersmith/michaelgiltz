MUSIC: The Best Albums Of 2018 or How
Everything Old Is New Again
Every year I make a list of my favorite albums. Of course, I put my
favoritest albums near the top, but any album on the list is worthy ofyour time. If you like the artist or the genre, give it a listen. But my #1pick? Clearly that's a statement: here's the BEST album of the year
and if you want to pretend you're hip or cool or care about music, well
you better lay down some vinyl, drop a needle and give it a listen! Andhow do I choose the best album of the year? Easy: which new albumhave I played the most? This year, however, I struggled. Was it this
album or that album or the other album? And why don't kids listen to
albums anymore? They'll binge-watch an entire season of a TV showfrom start to finish in two days -- in ORDER -- but they'd rather diethan listen to an album from an artist they love? What gives? Do they
pick up a book, read chapter seven and then chapter two and then
chapter sixteen and then move on to another book?
Ok, forget the kids. Suddenly, I realized my problem and why I was
struggling with naming my favorite album of the year. I was too
focused on the new . Yes, I am talking about the best albums of 2018
but streaming has permanently changed my listening habits. The latest
albums bump up against a sudden desperate need to check out AndyGibb or the entire catalog of The Temptations from start to finish orBuffalo Springfield (for the first time!) or The Carpenters. And if I'mbeing honest, the music I listened to the most in 2018, the music I
couldn't stop talking about and recommending, the musical career I
became mildly obsessed over was found on the boxed set The  Girl
From  Chickasaw  County:  The  Complete  Capitol  Masters  by  Bobbie
Gentry.
I knew the name. Bobbie Gentry was a classic one-hit wonder (I
thought), the voice behind the enigmatic, unforgettable single "Ode To
Billie Joe." I'd never heard an album of hers or even another song byMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

MUSIC: The Best Albums Of</p>
<p>her. And I don't think I'd ever heard anyone extolling her as an
unappreciated talent. But here's the boxed set containing all sorts of
live cuts and b-sides -- the usual boxed set material. It was compiled
by Andrew Batt, the guy who did similar work on the solo albums of
Sandy Denny. And just as his boxed set of Denny brought renewedattention to that singer, he is hoping the same will happen for Gentry.(Here's an excellent interview with Batt about the project. ) And
scattered in that boxed set are all the songs from seven studio albums(and one unreleased album of standards). I had to create playlists foreach one just so I could listen to them from start to finish without anydistractions. And what did I discover? One of the best albums of1967...and1968...and 1971...and 2018.

1. BOBBIE  GENTRY  -- 
The  Girl  From  Chickasaw  County:  The
Complete  Capitol  Masters
...and what did I discover? One of the best albums of1967...and1968...and 1971. I discovered a debut album suffused with
southern grit and sass and a marvelous sense of place, an album so
confident it saved the brilliant single "Ode To Billie Joe" for the finalcut. That's nerve. Then came a second album served up as a song cycle,one tune flowing into the next. If anything, it's even better. And thenthe crazy, dismissive, sexist music industry takes over, both praising
Gentry's albums and dismissing her as a cute little thing at the same
time. Bizarrely, despite her debut selling millions and topping thecharts and Gentry winning Grammys (including Best New Artist) andthe second album delivering artistically and being right in the
wheelhouse of her debut, it disappeared. I don't mean it didn't sell
that well; it barely  charted  on the Billboard 200, only reaching #132.
Her third album didn't even CHART. So Gentry played the game andrecorded a duets album with Glen Campbell, one of the hottest actsaround. It's her least interesting album by a country mile but it sold
tons and went straight to the top of the charts. Her fifth album, clearly
ready to capitalize on a revitalized Gentry with commercial appeal? Itpeaked at #164. Even curiouser was her songwriting. Gentry wrotemost of the songs on her debut and second album, but each releaseafter that included fewer and fewer originals, as if she'd run out of
things to say. Gentry has excellent taste in music so her covers are well
chosen. But given the outstanding quality of her writing, it's sad to seejust one original track by Gentry on her fifth and sixth studio albums.Eventually, the label just ignored her completely. Gentry's very goodseventh album -- which includes standards like "God Bless The Child"
and "Feelin' Good" -- wasn't released at all. Then out of nowhere she
recorded one final work. Gentry's eighth and final release (to date)contains all originals. Like many of the previous albums, she arrangedand produced the entire affair, even painting the album cover. It's awork of Americana very much in the spirit of Randy Newman and</p>
<p>Harry Nilsson and every bit the equal of their best work (and hers). It's
a triumphant capper and when it too sank without a trace I picture
Gentry making a hand gesture at the music world and heading out thedoor. Somewhere in there she did TV specials and then accepted ahuge paycheck from Las Vegas, where she directed and choreographed
and even designed the costumes for a hugely popular stage show,
starring in it for several years. Artistic control and more money thanshe ever saw from the record biz must have been sweet. Gentrymarried and divorced three times (always her own woman), wisely
invested and profited from the Phoenix Suns basketball team and
hasn't even glanced at the music biz since 1981. Reba McEntireincludes Gentry's song "Fancy" in most every concert she does andsurely Gentry's determination to do it all and do it her way has beenan inspiration to countless acts over the years. But what really matters
is the music and four of her eight albums are very good to stunning.
Start with the debut and thank me later. I've never named a reissue asmy favorite album before. Typically, I would just go back and insertthe album onto the list for the year it originally came out. But that'sthe beauty of streaming. You can listen to so much great music from
every era right now. If you're suddenly discovering classic Hollywood,
maybe your favorite movie of 2018 was 1944's The  Miracle  OfMorgan's  Creek.  Maybe the TV show you obsessed over was Firefly
from 2002. Maybe the book you couldn't stop sharing with friends wasStoner  by John Williams. Hey, diving into some classic stuff is a hell of
a lot better than just watching some dumb new movie because youremember seeing the trailer a few weeks ago. (Kevin Hart is prettyfunny; how bad can it be?) So my favorite album of 2018 is 1967's  Ode
To  Billie  Joe . Just like Gentry, I guess there's a little rebel in me.
Today, Mercury Rev is releasing a tribute to Gentry  that covers her
sensational second album with an all-star guest list of singers ranging
from Norah Jones to Lucinda Williams. Of course, they toss in "Ode
To Billie Joe" at the end, because how can't you? I'm looking forwardto checking it out and hope it keeps the Bobbie Gentry comeback a-rolling. But do check out the original albums first.
Follow me on Spotify! Or just go here to check out my playlists for the
albums. I've got all eight on my playlists but here are the three best:
Ode To Billie Joe  
The Delta SweetePatchwork
2. JANELLE  MONÁE  -- Dirty  Computer  
The craziest, sexiest, coolest album of the year. Monáe covers the
waterfront stylistically, from Prince to Madonna to Marvin Gaye toNina Simone and she does it on an album bursting with great songs
that is also one of the boldest political statements in years. I've been in
love with her talent for ages and this was the moment it all came</p>
<p>together. She threatened to explode commercially -- certainly the
media coverage said this was Her Moment. But it didn't happen, at
least not on the charts. Unquestionably her reach in pop culture is
strong, from her video album to her savvy use of ad endorsements tokeep that profile high. But the streaming success she deserves has notarrived. Yet. She'll just have to settle for being a terrific artist.
3. KAMASI  WASHINGTON  -- Heaven  and  Earth
Kamasi Washington gave a shot in the arm to jazz and re-awakened
my love for the genre as a source of new music. (Jazz is always in the
mix for me when it comes to icons like Miles Davis and Louis
Armstrong.) And if I have one huge complaint about streaming it's thepiss-poor selection of jazz and classical and world music. This year itseemed like all the new jazz I could hear let me down...when I couldfind them at all. But Washington delivered with an album just assprawling, messy, vibrant and alive as his breakthrough work a fewyears ago. I'll keep searching for the latest jazz releases, but Spotify
and Apple need to step it up.
4. ANGELIQUE  KIDJO  -- Remain  In  Light
What a trip! What a great way to appreciate again both Kidjo and
Talking Heads. She tackled their entire album Remain  in  Light  and it's
a trippy revelation. It's hard to know what's more exciting: her singingand how she makes this eccentric, seemingly un-coverable album herown or the greatness that was Talking Heads.
5. PANIC!  AT  THE  DISCO  -- Pray  For  The  Wicked
I may not care that Janelle Monáe didn't break commercially. (She
doesn't need it.) But I am THRILLED that Panic! At the Disco has a
monster single with "High Hopes," their first Top 10 hit since 2006.This is a band that deserves, needs, nay demands  pop glory and now
they've got it. You liked Bohemian  Rhapsody?  Well, what the heck are
you waiting for? They're not Queen (no one is); they are their ownband. But they are definitely in that lane: melodramatic pop-rock,
surging melodies, over the top vocals and roll-down-the-windows
turn-up-the-volume choruses. I've loved them for years and havepuzzled over why critics didn't go gaga for them. But I was even moreconfused as to why their radio-crushing singles weren't crushing
radio. Well, now they are.
6. BRANDI  CARLILE  -- By  The  Way,  I  Forgive  You
Speaking of melodrama, Brandi Carlile has a gift for it in a shameless,
stirring way that would make Roy Orbison nod his head in
appreciation. Carlile is in a country rock vein, not the pop opera of Mr
Orbison. But that heart on her sleeve emotion combined with amaturity in her outlook and empathy (after all, she forgives you) makethis so perfect for the lovelorn that her backing band should be called</p>
<p>the Heartbreakers.
7. THE  JOHN  SALLY  RIDE  -- Nothing  Doing
Wait, WTF? My friend Sal recorded an album as a member of The
John Sally Ride last year. Their debut was -- I thought -- a happyaccident, an alignment of the planets that allowed veteran musicians
to record and release the album of their careers, power pop rock
performed with the sheer joy of kids but with the insight only adultscould deliver. It was, well -- not a fluke . I mean, they're talented. But
surely it was something to cherish and maybe in the back of my mind Ithought it would never happen again. How often does lightning strike?
I wasn't even sure the band was a going concern. And then out of
nowhere comes their second album. And it's...better than the first! Itcontains more power pop, which is one way of describing rock n rollwith killer hooks recorded by people with a few miles on them. Fromits default sad sack perspective to hilarious one-liners and melodiesthat sink in and won't let go, this in every respect builds on everythingthat was good from their first album. I hate to reduce them to humor,
but it's a big initial part of the appeal, until you recognize the pain and
sadness and regret that underlie all the laughs. But laugh you will,from the first track "Embarrassingly Single" to "I Won't Let Failure GoTo My Head" to "I Usually Eat Alone" (are they stalking me?) and the
kiss-off "Don't Flatter Yourself." Holy shit, they've got a band. And a
discography. And a career!
8. NELLIE  MCKAY  -- Sister  Orchid
Nellie McKay is such a talent, such a bouquet of talent that people
can't pin her down. If I were in charge, she'd already have her ownvariety show on TV somewhere, along with a blank check to dowhatever she wanted on her days off.   She's already done it all, from
Broadway to pop albums to one-woman bio-musicals about importantfemale figures in history to leading the Resistance with sly humor andsmarts. Oh and she records albums. Her latest is a gem and McKay'sbest since her tribute to Doris Day. For such a talented songwriter,she's really shown a commitment to the classics, whether doing coversof 60s pop to that Doris Day album to this new collection of standards.
She recorded it entirely on her own, a la Prince, if Prince were
suddenly to discover a talent for the Great American Songbook. It's aquiet, turn off the lights and sit in the dark sort of album. Think FrankSinatra's In  The  Wee  Small  Hours  or Ella Fitzgerald's The  Intimate
Ella.  From the opening track "My Romance" (which makes canny,
subtle use of over-dubbing) to a droll "Lazybones" and a vulnerable"Where Or When," McKay creates a real spell here. She does a lotwithout ever showing off, like the sound effects that create a piano barmood on one tune that will make you laugh without ever being jokey.Or the marvelous arrangement that tops off "In A Sentimental Mood."
Or the fact that she covers "Georgia On My Mind" when I thought
we'd never need another cover of "Georgia On My Mind" pretty muchever, but damned if she doesn't pull it off. I especially enjoy how she</p>
<p>allows her vocals to be naked and vulnerable at just the right lyrical
moment. Anyone who appreciates Broadway or the classic albums of
the 1950s by Ella and Anita O'Day and Dinah Washington, anyonewho loves cabaret? They simply must get this now. In a word,
exquisite.
9. BETA  RADIO  -- Transition
The label I want for this music isn't Americana. Maybe the Band
comes close to what I'm thinking, the feel you get when you're hearingmusic that seems to be created right this very moment but has alwaysexisted. You see glimmers of it in Mumford & Sons (sort of) but moreso in the likes of Fleet Foxes and Midlake. And you hear it in Beta
Radio. One year, after doing my annual story about my favorite music,
someone did what I love: they made a recommendation. Hey, checkout Beta Radio, they said. I did and was immediately besotted. I thinkthis is the third album for the North Carolina duo. In 2010 they putout Seven  Sisters.  In 2014 it was Colony  of  Bees  and now in 2018
Transition . Which means, I assume, we can look forward to another
album in 2022. Quiet but restless, wise but confused, the lyrics of BetaRadio are rooted in the everyday and the need for more. They'll stopyou dead in your tracks, if you know what I mean. I'm playing a fewtracks as I write this and suddenly I'm finding it hard to move on tothe next album I want to talk about. If you're still waiting for Tim
Smith to release his solo album (take your time, Tim!), don't wait to
check this out. The real deal.
10. VARIOUS  ARTISTS  -- Black  Panther  
A de facto Kendrick Lamar album with a whole lot of guests, this was
more immediately accessible to me than Damn.  Like the film, it's
expansive and positive and conflicted and determined to be true toitself. Given his track record on TV appearances, Lamar's duet with
SZA at the Oscars when they perform "All The Stars" will give Lady
Gaga and Bradley Cooper a run for their money. Don't get me wrong:"Shallow" will win the Oscar. But who knows? Black  Panther  could
come out of nowhere and win the Oscar for Best Picture or theGrammy for Best Album. It's got the music this project deserves.
11. CÉCILE  MCLORIN  SALVANT  -- The  Window
The most exciting jazz singer around does it again. Indeed, "more of
the same" is a very high compliment for an artist who has been on fire
in the past few years and delivered my favorite album of 2017. Theheir to Cassandra Wilson, Salvant draws on a wide range of influences.But she establishes her own magnetic identify as an artist withpiercing insight into the lyrics, tremendous humor and a voice that can
do anything but knows not to, at least not all the time. Thrilling.
12. ARCTIC  MONKEYS  -- Tranquility  Base  Hotel  and  Casino</p>
<p>Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...oh wait, actually I do  like the new
Arctic Monkeys album. At first, it sounded more like a project for the
Alex Turner offshoot The Last Shadow Puppets. But what's in a name?The band has wowed me from the start and so have most of their
albums. So when you respect an act that much, you're willing to live
with a new album that takes a left-turn and come back to it and let itgrow on you. This one did.
13. KASEY  CHAMBERS  -- Campfire
What kind of a jerk wishes a marriage hadn't ended just because he
enjoyed the albums that now-divorced couple produced? I keepwondering what she would do next with her ex Shane Nichols when
Kasey Chambers has delivered one sprawling, exciting solo album after
another. This one is dead simple, a real campfire sing-along of analbum. A treat.
14. BENJAMIN  JAFFE  -- Oh,  Wild  Ocean  Of  Love
State of the art neo-soul for those waiting for the next Maxwell. Deeply
impressive and the debut of the year.
15. VARIOUS  ARTISTS  -- African  Scream  Contest  2
Somehow I missed the apparently landmark compilation African
Scream  Contest.  Its sequel brought me back to those glory days of the
late 1980s and early 1990s when African pop was exploding and witheach new compilation I found about a dozen new artists worthexploring. Like so many compilations, this may not be something you
dive back into again and again -- it's a primer.   But it's exciting and
generous and opens your mind. Streaming really does drop the ball
when it comes to world music (and jazz and classical) and I fear forthe gaps in my musical knowledge that this is creating. African
Scream  Contest  2  helps to fill in the gaps.
16. SHAKEY  GRAVES  -- Can't  Wake  Up
A terrific Americana act, Shakey Graves opened as a busker forMumford & Sons, which gives you an idea of his wheelhouse. He
definitely gave off a street-corner vibe on earlier albums, though eachone has proven a little bolder in its instrumentation and arrangements.Every time I put him on, I think "Why aren't I listening to this moreoften?"
17. ESPERANZA  SPALDING  -- 12  Little  Spells
Esperanza Spalding's talent is so expansive it can get away from her.
Like Norah Jones, her ability to make most anything seem magnetic in
the moment allows her to sometime drift over ideas rather than dig
deeper. Here she digs deeper and delivers the melodies to anchor her</p>
<p>always impressive vocals and playing. A return to form.
18. ELVIS  COSTELLO  -- Look  Now
A veteran with fire in his belly. Costello has delivered impressive
albums in all sorts of styles, rarely going a few years without delivering
a knock out punch artistically. Here he reunites with the Imposters
and reminds us he can still rock out too. To anyone who's been payingattention, it's no surprise at all.
19. COURTNEY  BARNETT  -- Tell  Me  How  You  Really  Feel  
A smidge less fun than most of her albums, which have a dry wit
rivaling Bob Dylan, this more serious album is...more serious. Herguitar work and deadpan vocals and rambling melodies remain a treat
and I'm sure I'm just being a kvetch who complained she was
repeating herself and now that she's moved ever so slightly to the left,I'm complaining that she's not doing what she did before. Critics!
20.  NAS  -- Nasir
Lately, I find I have NO patience for hip-hop that even remotely leans
toward the glorification of violence or dismissive attitudes towardswomen. I just don't want to hear it. But Nas remains an artist who candocument violence or his own complicated past without ever giving it
nodding approval. Like Costello, he still has fire in his belly and anyone
who has been paying attention won't be surprised in the least by thisvital album.
21. TONY  BENNETT  AND  DIANA  KRALL  -- 
Love  Is  Here  To  Stay
It's been a terrific year for albums of standards and this one is right up
there. Bennett's voice has been reduced to a whisper of its former self,but like Willie Nelson he has such command and swing of the littlevocals left to him that it still works wonders. He and Krall are an
awesome pairing with chemistry to spare. A treat.
22. BIRCH  PEREIRA  -- Western  Soul
As fun as his album may be, what I really want to do is grab a cold
beer and catch Birch and his band in a dive bar somewhere. Then I'llbe a fan for life.
23. TRACEY  THORN  -- Record
One of the great voices in pop, Tracey Thorn has delivered enough
solo gems now that -- as a body of work -- it's beginning to rival themusic she recorded with Everything But The Girl. And that's very highpraise. Toss in the fact that I suddenly realized she was writing
columns for New Statesman and now I can enjoy her witty, insightful
writing all the time and not just when she published a book or</p>
<p>recorded a new album and 2018 was a banner year for this fan of
Thorn. ( Here's her latest column. ) One of those acts you spend a
lifetime appreciating and they keep rewarding your loyalty in
unexpected and delightful ways.
24. SCOTT  MATTHEWS  -- The  Great  Untold
How did I miss Scott Matthews? He hits my sweet spot, seems to have
been critically acclaimed for years with reviews that name check otheracts I respect (John Prine, et al) and yet I've been shamefully unawareof him till now. Well, The  Great  Untold  wowed me, with its hushed
vocals and plaintive melodies and singer-songwriter vibe. Now I'mgingerly exploring his earlier work, wondering what I'll find. For themoment, he's my favorite new old friend.
25. MACY  GRAY  -- Ruby
Saucy, smart, ribald and fun. But above all, that gravely, distinctive,
memorable can't confuse her with anyone else voice.
26. JASON  ALDEAN  -- Rearview  Town  
More solid country, from the left side of the tracks.
27. MADELEINE  PEYROUX  -- Anthem
Well, hey there! It's been a while. Peyroux has always been a little hit
or miss for me. But boy when she hits, she's a treasure. Here, she hits
and if I knew why this worked and some other albums of hers didn't,
well I'd be Rick Rubin, wouldn't I? If you fell hard for Careless  Love,like I did, you'll enjoy this one too.
28. DRAKE  -- Scorpion
Not that anyone cares about greatest hits albums anymore, but boy is
Drake going to have a killer one. The three big singles from this hugedouble album are tremendous fun. The real surprise for me is how it
all holds together. Artists are shoving tons of tracks onto their albums
for all the wrong reasons (manipulating the charts, etc.). So I assumedthe 25 tracks of Scorpion  would be about 10 tracks too many. But
no...the bigness of it and the quality won out. If people still put outgreatest hits albums he could put one out now that would rival Elton
John's Greatest  Hits  Vol.  One  for sheer pop dominance.
29. JAMES  HUNTER  -- Whatever  It  Takes
Damn, James Hunter is consistent. He delivers blue-eyed soul circaLondon and he's always good. And then sometimes he's really really
good. Like here. One of his best, though it's so sneakily great you'll beenjoying yourself too much the first few times you play it to actuallyrealize that.</p>
<p>30.  TROYE  SIVAN  -- Bloom
Sexy enough to make me blush, from the Grindr experience opener
"Seventeen" to the closing "Animal" I don't think he's blushing though,
which is a key to the album's strength. A great leap forward from hisdebut. Tag on the Queen cover "Somebody To Love" and this is a veryqueer, very exciting album. What's next?
31. RICK  SPRINGFIELD  -- The  Snake  King
That's right, I said Rick Springfield! I really can't be too adamant, as if
I know we should all be surprised. I've always appreciated his clutch of
terrific singles but somehow never listened to an album other than a
greatest hits set I plunked down for. Now, thanks to streaming and anintriguing review, I checked out his apparently atypical latest release.It is, I kid you not, a crazily good combination of blues guitar andlyrics akin to Bob Dylan circa Highway  61  Revisited.  It's defiantly
bawdy, atheistic, ballsy, righteous, angry, God-mocking, political,funny and just plain mind-blowing. I'm almost afraid to play it,worried the spell it cast on me during a road trip won't be repeated.But oh my god it blew my mind and made me laugh and just plainrocked ! I want to have a drink with Rick Springfield and I don't even
drink.
32. LINDA  THOMPSON  -- 
My  Mother  Doesn't  Know  I'm  On  The
Stage
This is really an evening of music hall entertainment hosted by Linda
Thomson, with everyone from Martha Wainwright to Colin Firth (!) to
son Teddy Thompson delivering humorous and sad songs of a vintagesort to an appreciative audience. An offbeat pleasure.
33. FALL  OUT  BOY  -- Mania
Like Panic! At The Disco, they know how to deliver the pop goods.
34. ROSEANNE  CASH  -- She  Remembers  Everything
Just when she seemed to be edging into a respectable, elder
stateswoman, Cash delivers a terrific new album of depth and passion.No, she's not done yet.
35. BUDDY  GUY  -- The  Blues  Is  Alive  And  Well
Oh god no, please. A new album from a legend, filled with celebrity
guests? I know how this turns out...except here Biddy Guy is really onfire, the celebrity guests stay out of the way and it's just a blast. Don't
be wary. The blues really is alive and well here.
36. GORILLAZ  -- The  Now  Now</p>
<p>Is Gorillaz more important now than Blur? Is Damon Albarn one of
the sneakiest geniuses at disguising his impressive talent by donningone mask after another? Does it matter? The music, as always, is verygood.
37. MANDY  PATINKIN  -- 
Diary:  January  27,  2018/  April,  May
2018Yet another impressive album of covers. Patinkin began his recording
career with a string of very good solo albums but lost his way just alittle. Here's he found an excellent collaborator in Doveman, akaThomas Bartlett. They bounce song ideas off one another and thenrecord almost spontaneously. The result are what Patinkin charmingly
calls diaries. The first, from January of 2018, was strong but the
second one had an even better mix of songs and a deeper connectionbetween the two artists. The off the cuff nature keeps Patinkin fromperhaps getting in his own way vocally (like Streisand, he canoverthink in the studio). And the intimacy of the recording is a treat,
letting you feel like you're eavesdropping in on a conversation. I sure
as hell didn't expect a cover of Dylan's "Lily, Rosemary and the Jack OfHearts" -- I would have said it wasn't a song anyone should cover untilPatinkin proved me wrong. It's just the most unexpected of manytreats on what I assume and hope will be more diaries to come.
38.  THE  VINES  -- In  Miracle  Land  
A wonderful, Beatles-esque talent that exploded in their debut, got
bogged down in personal travails and is back showing the gift formelodies and hooks and sheer pop genius that made you go nuts for
them in the first place. Welcome back.
39. JOSH  ROUSE  -- Love  In  The  Modern  Age
Sometimes you feel guilty when you love an album by an artist and
then don't keep touting them in the years to come, even as others hearsomething you don't. So yes, I was crazy about Josh Rouse's time travelof an album 1972  and -- while I really liked one or two others -- I
drifted away. Now he's tackling the 1980s on 
Love  In  The  Modern  Age
and here I am again, cheering. I suppose I'll return to the fold when hetackles the 1950s. But as with 1972 , he both captures the musical vibe
of an era yet never falls into mimicry. Great fun.
40. JEFF  TWEEDY  -- Warm / BOZ  SCAGGS  -- 
Out  Of  the  Blues
Two veterans delivering. It hasn't happened a while for Tweedy, who
gives ragged charm to a clutch of originals that remind you what a hellof a songwriter he can be. Scaggs has been consistently excellent for a
long time now. He does it again on this gem, which slips by with his
usual elegance -- it's sleek, smart, sophisticated and sneakily moving.</p>
<p>42. ELLA  FITZGERALD/  LOUIS  ARMSTRONG  -- Cheek  To
Cheek:  The  Complete  Duet  Recordings  
I started with a boxed set so I might as well end with one. It simply
doesn't get better than Ella and Louis duetting. Any fool can enjoy itand you'd be a fool if you didn't lend an ear. Two giants who brought
out the best in each other. Actually, it's hard to say who is the better
duet partner since they both brought out the best in so many others.Here you have a late career peak for two artists who enjoyed so many.It's a joy from start to finish.
