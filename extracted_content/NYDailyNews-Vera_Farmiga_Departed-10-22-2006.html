Vera Farmiga, the only woman in 'The Departed,' 
holds her own BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
The cast of Martin Scorsese's "The Departed " -Matt 
Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson , Mark 
Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin -have been in the cross 
hairs of critical praise. But Vera Fanniga, who plays 
a shrink dating apparent straight-arrow cop Damon 
but drawn to bad-boy undercover mole DiCaprio, can't help but 
stand out, even among all that talent. She's the only gal in sight. 
"It never really dawned on me until 
I actually saw the film," laughs Farmi· 
ga about taking on the lone major female 
character in the testosterone-heavy crime 
drama "It's not till now that I realize the 
tremendous responsibility I had in this 
film. It was going to be a representation of 
my gender' But I never felt that pressure ." 
With Scorsese back on the mean 
streets -this time in Boston -the film 
opened at No.1 and looks set to become 
the acclaimed director's biggest hit. And 
it's the first box-office success for New 
Jersey-born Farmiga, who's spent the last 
decade working steadily. 
The actress. whose looks and perfor. 
mance in "The Departed" have drawn 
comparisons to Cate Blanchett and even 
early·career Meryl Streep. is certainly not 
a generic hottie·of-the-mom ent. but she is 
definitely enjoying her first Big Moment. 
"J've never been part of a huge hit," 
says Farmiga, 33. "I'm excited. But then 
it takes very littJe for me to get excited -\ get excited about earthworm s. I get 
excited over hydrangeas. But I'm also 
excited for myself because hopefully it 
gives some visibility to some other proj· 
ects I really care abouL" 
Indeed, Farmiga's labor of love, the 2004 drama "Down to the Bone" comes 
out on DVD next week. Though it was 
here-and-gone in theaten;, it garnered 
Farrniga the best -actress award from the 
L.A. Film Critics Association and was a 
favorite at that year's Sundance Film Fes­
tival. And while some acton; might care· 
fully follow a movie like "The Departed" 
with another big-budget HoUywood proj­
ect, Farrniga describes a string of intrigu­
ing independ ent films due out in the next 
year or so. 
In "Quid Pro Quo," which co-stan; 
Nick Stahl, she plays a woman suffering 
from an illness that makes her feel like 
a paraplegi c trapped in an able-bodied 
woman's body. In "Joshua." she plays 
a woman scared that she and her hus­
band (Sam Rockwell) raised a socio­
path "In Tranzit" finds Farmiga play­
ing a Russian nurse during World 
War II who may be falling in love 
with a high-ranking Nazi. "Never 
Forever" has Farmiga married to a 
Korean-Am erican man but plan­
ning an adulterous affair with an­
other so she can get pregnant and, 
she believes, save her marriage. 
A more high-profile project comes this 
January, when she co-stan; opposIte Jude .. ,., ....... 
Jersey's Vera Farmig; 
In the upcoming draIT 
"Breaking and Enter· 
ing" (far I.) and in "The 
Departed " (above, with 
Matt Damon), in which 
she plays a conflicted 
police psychologist . 
Law, Juliette Binoche and Robin Wright 
Penn in director Anthony Minghella's 
drama "Breaking and Entering ." 
"It's not a matter of Hollywood or in· 
dependent film," says Farmiga, who was 
raised in a tightly knit Ukrainian com­
munity in Passaic County. ''I'ni going to 
go for where the most interesting charac 
ters are and I'm going to go for where th 
most interestin g and unique story lines 
are, and risky filmmakers , filrnmalcers 
who have a vision, an undiluted vision. 
That's what I'm drawn to." 
She's also drawn to hard rock. Living 
now in upstate New York, Farmiga 
talks up a Japanese thrash band 
called Dir En Gray and men­
tions she's dating a member ( 
the hard rock group Deadsy. 
Living away from the city let 
her play her music loud and 
keep the hype of Hollywood 
in check. 
"I Jive upstate and it gives IT 
a good pen;pective," she says." 
steady vantage where J can c1earl)­
see the business and the industry and a 
gorgeous view, the beautiful arch of the 
sky -and that's where my answers lie." 
A dream project is turning Milan Kun· 
dera's 1999 novel "Identity" into a film. 
but Farmiga is happy to have an identity 
of her own as an actress devoted to chal· 
lenging rotes 
"The way 1 choose my projects now 
is different," says Farmiga. whose early 
break, in 1997. was the cheesy summer 
TV series "Roar," a "Braveheart " wanna­
be co·starring Heath Ledger. "I call truly 
pick the slories I feel compelled hy." •</p>
