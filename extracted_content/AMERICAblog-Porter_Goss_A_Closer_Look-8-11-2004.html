8/11/2004 01:25:00 AMThe New York Times looks at the political and intelligenceramifications of nominating Porter Goss. Republicans are alreadytrying to paint any Democrats who oppose Porter as endangeringnational security; Democrats are already backing off. It's prettysimple: at the heart of the C.I.A.'s problem seems to have been apoliticization of intelligence (Cheney stepping in and demanding heget unfiltered data; Bush making a decision to invade and thendemanding the intelligence be cut to fit; Tenet telling Bush what hewanted to hear rather than asking the hard questions; the C.I.A.giving briefings to Congress that avoided grey areas and presentedfaulty or even contrary evidence in black and white.) The head of theC.I.A. is historically non-partisan (as opposed to the AttorneyGeneral, which often is). Bush chose a nominee that is extremelypartisan that he knew top Democrats objected to. But instead ofcoming out swinging and saying Bush is endangering nationalsecurity by choosing a nominee he knows doesn't have broadbipartisan support, they are already heading for cover.
