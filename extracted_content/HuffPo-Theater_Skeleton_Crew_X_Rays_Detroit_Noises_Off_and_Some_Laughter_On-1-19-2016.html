SKELETON CREW  *** out of ****
NOISES OFF  ** out of **** but *** or *** 1/2 if you've never seen it before
SKELETON CREW  *** out of ****
ATLANTIC THEATER COMPANY
Playwright Dominique Morisseau triumphantly concludes her Detroit
trilogy with Skeleton Crew,  a look at a fading automobile plant in the
winter of 2008. Obama has become President, but the car industry isreeling, something that's readily apparent for the shift workers of one
of the smallest remaining factory lines in town. Times are tough and
getting tougher: shifts are being cut, everyone is a paycheck or twoaway from the streets and Reggie has made the leap from factory floorto supervisor. That's enough responsibility to leave him stranded:
management still sees him as a black man with one foot on the floor
while most of the people on the floor see him as the Man, alwaystrifling with them over minor infractions no matter how good their work
on the line may be.
Is life tense? Always. Michael Carnahan's excellent production design
brings that to life immediately as we sense the worn-down despair of
the break room, a space lined with battered lockers, a fridge, a coffee
pot, the clock for punching in and an apparently endless stream ofsigns pronouncing rules like NO SMOKING and NO GAMBLING orstating that anyone's bag might be searched at any time.
That sign about no smoking is directed at Faye (Lynda Gravatt), who
blithely lights up and blows smoke in its direction right at the start of Theater: 'Skeleton Crew' X-Rays Detroit; 'Noises Off' and Some Laughter On</p>
<p>the show. She's the union rep for her crew and abides enough by the
rules to stop smoking when supervisor Reggie (Wendell B. Franklin)
walks in, but not enough to actually NOT smoke on her break.
Sometimes, it's just too damn cold outside. Unfortunately, it's gettingcolder.
Her co-workers include Dez (Jason Dirden) and the very pregnant
Shanita (Nikiya Mathis). With an economy of words, Morisseau sets up
a host of storylines battling for our attention. The plant is indeedclosing, but Reggie confides in Faye and asks her not to tell anyone.But it's her job as the union rep to demand management help
employees prepare for the transition. And when Shanita says she's
been offered a job at a copy store but will turn it down becauseworking on cars means too much to her, the tension for Faye ispalpable. This isn't some battle between management and unions over
rules and who gets what. This is about people's lives.
Shanita has a teasing, friendly relationship with Dez, but is he really the
man she wants in her life? Dez is packing a gun to work, though
whether that's just due to the lawless aura of Detroit at the time or a
hint he's tied the spate of thievery plaguing auto plants, we can't besure. We know Faye sees Reggie as almost a son, certainly a better
son than the one that rejected her for being lesbian. But our knowledge
of the collapsing economy (not to mention the irony that Detroit wouldcome roaring back...after firing countless employees and squeezing outconcessions from unions before  posting record profits in 2015) makes
the drama on display take on the aura of inevitable tragedy. Thechoices don't seem to be between right and wrong but between badand worse.
Morisseau's play is unquestionably a strong, formidable work. Having
seen Detroit '67,  I would love to see the entire trilogy mounted and
soon. Director Ruben Santiago-Hudson has crafted an excellent
production that does it full justice, especially with a faultless cast. The</p>
<p>tech elements are strong as well -- from Paul Tazewell's costumes to
the lighting of Rui Rita to the score and sound design of Robert
Kaplowitz and the original songs of Jimmy Keys, songs so good I halfassumed they were oldies I was unfamiliar with.
In a bold stroke, dancer Adesola Osakalumi sets the tone immediately
with his choreographed dance moves as a "mechanized" worker on the
factory floor. In one gesture, the show recognizes the march ofrobotics not to mention how workers are seen as cogs in a machinewithout belaboring either point. On the down side, Osakalumi offers a
visual break to early scenes and then disappears for a stretch of time in
act one. When he returned, I'd almost forgotten about him. This may beone reason the first act played a bit long. In act two, his presence iswelcome and consistent, though it should also be noted he was doing
his bits while we could see actors getting into place, allowing his
performance to be recognized as not just "filler" killing time, whereas in
act one he was often the only person we could see clearly. Further,
when he's quietly tapped on the shoulder towards the end of the show,it seemed to echo the firings taking place, which made hisreappearance at the end of the scene even more confusing. A
consistent approach to when he appears might make the whole show
flow more smoothly.
Further, the small space available might have lessened the impact of
the visuals deployed by projection designer Nicholas Hussong; mostly
they felt beside the point. Deployed along the frame of the set, theydidn't get in the way when shown during scene changes but weren't
the plus they might have been, either. And while Shanita had two of the
show's best monologues (an ode to the days when people knew how tomerge on the highway and her love of being part of building cars), Imust admit the character Mathis played went in and out of focus for
me once or twice. At times she seemed very smart, at other times a
little silly. Finally, without revealing the climax, I didn't care for somelate show plot twists. It's hardly a happy ending, but Skeleton Crew
seems built for tragedy -- in a way, too many of the characters are
given a modest reprieve when what it really calls for is, sadly, to crushthem down.
But these are cavils I note when wondering why perhaps Skeleton
Crew  doesn't immediately hit the heights of greatness. It's a good play
with a great cast and one theatergoers won't want to miss. All fourleads are by and large impeccable, with Dirden and Franklin two terrific
foils for one another, while Mathis captures Shanita's sweetness with
ease and Gravatt so good as the world-weary Faye you wonder if wecan start adding "the great" to her name. It's a skeleton crew on the</p>
<p>line, but Morisseau has put flesh and bone on the people who work
that line and done it with grace.
NOISES OFF  ** out of **** but *** or even *** 1/2 if you've never seen it
before
ROUNDABOUT THEATRE COMPANY AT AMERICAN AIRLINES
THEATRE
Have I ever told you about the time I saw the original production of
Noises Off in London? I joined my mother for my first trip overseas. She
was there as a tennis umpire working Wimbledon. We attended a
warm-up tournament and then of course the fortnight. While sheworked constantly, we booked plenty of time for tourist-y things for me
including -- naturally -- theater. What did I want to see, she asked? I
was just 16, it was the summer of 1982 and it hadn't opened yet in NewYork City but I knew Cats  was a big hit. "Eww! I don't want to see a
show about cats!" she shuddered, never being much of a pet person.
No, she chose... No Sex Please, We're British,  an absolutely dreadful
British farce that was panned by critics -- back in 1971! This wasn't a
revival; it was the same production. Somehow, it continued to run and
run and run until finally exhausting even the British desire for lowbrow
humor whenever Are You Being Served  wasn't airing on TV and finally
closed in 1987. Unfortunately for me, that was five years too late andwe saw it. The show was pitiful, I was peevish and halfway through mymother said I could choose the next one, no questions asked. (Thoughnot Cats .)
Somehow I knew enough to pick Noises Off and we got tickets. Littledid I realize that seeing that miserable umpteenth performance of NoSex Please, We're British  was the perfect way to set up Michael
Frayn's delicious spoof of farce and the life of actors. I might not haveappreciated it as much if I hadn't just endured No Sex Please.  Even
better, I hadn't a clue as to what the show actually did, so its extremelyclever script was a complete surprise. If you don't know how the show
works, by all means, go see the current Roundabout revival and stop
reading now.
So if you're still reading, you know: act one is a late night rehearsal of a
dreadful farce and act two takes place behind the scenes (the entireset revolves) as we hear the farce being performed offstage and watchthe cast and crew silently enact petty jealousies, romances,
misunderstandings and the like that have disastrous effects on the play
being performed out of view. Act three shows us the play beingperformed one last time with our full knowledge of the sort of anarchy
taking place offstage and the disastrous result for audiences. Noises</p>
<p>Off starts amusingly, builds hilariously upon itself in act two and then
triples the fun in act three. That original production remains one of the
fondest memories of my theater-going life.
I almost didn't bother seeing the ill-fated 2001 Broadway revival.
Nothing could compete with the original and I really didn't want to spoil
my memories. Coming on the heels of 9-11 certainly didn't help.Somehow it ran almost a year but few felt it did the play justice.
And here we are again. Jeremy Herrin directs a pitch perfect cast and
really I have no complaints. The actors are committed and create
specific, real characters, which can and should make the comedy
funnier. They're not just delivering broad comedy here. Andrea Martinis ideal as the veteran star having an affair with a much younger castmember, Megan Hilty is fun as the dumb blonde (God help you if you
can't have fun in this show), Jeremy Shamos is amusingly pitiful as the
sad sack prone to nose bleeds, David Furr delicious as the dim-witconstantly interrupting rehearsals to make vague pronouncements,Daniel Davis (always of The Nanny  for me) especially good as the
alcoholic actor always searching for the bottle, Kate Jennings Grantcalm and beautiful as the voice of reason, Campbell Scott rakish as thedirector of this dreadful troupe and Tracee Chimo stuck in the ratherthankless role of playing the rather thankless role of a jack of all trades
assistant/backstage manager.
I watched their performances with admiration and respect. (Rob
McClure still escapes my imagination, but he did display a rather
hilarious gift for shaking that serves his stage-shy crew member well.)The audience roared with pleasure. My guest -- who worked on theshow in college and liked everyone (while insisting she could do a
better job as the hapless actress Brooke) -- absolutely leapt to her feet</p>
<p>at the end, a rarity for that jaded theater-goer.
I certainly had a fine time and enjoyed it much more than the revival of
2001. But somehow, it left me cold. Is Noises Off one of those shows
whose pleasures depend on that first viewing? There's absolutelynothing wrong with that, though of course a truly great work shouldreward repeated viewing, not dim. But heck, how many shows are this
funny even one time around? I'm positively flummoxed as to my own
personal reaction to this production. All I can say is that I'll never be 16again. But if you've never seen Noises Off,  by all means don't hesitate
to check it out. If you do, the next revival will pale in comparison
because apparently, you never forget your first time.
