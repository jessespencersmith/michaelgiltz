Dead poets' society 
Three great gay poets live again on spoken-word CDs that let 
you read along By Michael Giltz 
The Voice of the Poet series: 
Allen Ginsbergj W.H. Audenj and 
Frank O'Hara. CDs with companion 
books containing text offeatured poems and 
commentaries by J.D. McClatchy. Random 
House Audio. $19.95 each 
,oetry is the least necessary of 
the arts-until you start read­
ing it. Then it becomes only 
as necessary as blood and 
oxygen. This is true even if 
you sit quietly in a corner and read to 
yourself, but poetry is meant to be 
heard, which is why "The Voice of the 
Poet" is such a welcome series, pairing 
CDs-each containing about an hour of archival recordings of the author 
declaiming his work-with slim pa­
perbacks presenting the text along G 1 
with tidy scholarly essays, by cele­
brated poet J.D. McClatchy, about ,,,._:-::.:, .. ,H.:~ 
the respective authors. -. 
The latest batch features three gay 
poets: Frank O'Hara, Allen Ginsberg, 
and W. H. Auden. McClatchy is direct 
about the sexuality of the first two but 
almost as circumspect about the third as 
Auden was himself. The only tip-offs to 
his gay leanings are references to 
Auden's living in Berlin with Christopher 
Isherwood, plunging into the "homosex­
ual underworld," and lifelong roommate 
Chester Kallman, the American poet.

the sound of his own voice and didn't 
enjoy public readings. No wonder, then, 
that his style is rather flat and affect­
less, fighting against the humor and 
vital drama of pieces like "Poem (Lana 
Turner Has Collapsed!)" and "The Day 
Lady Died." 
Auden is as patrician as any British 
poet should be. He may have written 
about cornflakes or, in "The Common 
Life," talked about "our roll-call of 
persons we would least like to go to 
bed with," but his is the voice of the 
old man of letters, not the young 
rebel. (And, no, the poem from Four 
Weddings and a Funeral is not heard 
in this series.) 
Ginsberg is the best reader of the 
three. He loved to entertain, loved large 
crowds, and loved the sound of his own 
voice. All of "Howl" is here, and that 
landmark alone, far more arresting out 
loud than on the page, proves that the 
voice of the poet, whenever possible, 
should be heard .• 
1911 The world of poets is small-even 
smaller if you focus on the gay ones. 
O'Hara showed one of his early pieces 
to Auden and in 1964 dedicated his 
witty, movie-soaked poem "Fantasy" to 
"the health of Allen Ginsberg." It was 
only fair: In 1958 Ginsberg had dedicat­
ed "My Sad Self" to O'Hara, whose 
health was presumably not in question 
at the time.
