9/27/2004 03:10:00 AMBy the way, the post below about Britain pledging to pay down 10%of Third World debt had an interesting factoid at the end.The New York Times article said, "Some estimates put the total debtowed by the poorest countries at around $200 billion."That coincidentally, is the very amount Bush has spent so far oninvading Iraq (not to mention the cost in lives). Instead of invadingIraq, Bush could have paid off the ENTIRE debt of some 30+ ThirdWorld countries, given countless nations a radical chance atimproving their economic livelihood, created tremendous good will forthe US, encouraged them (through incentives) to embrace democracyand economic reform (which would be far harder for governments toavoid with the huge opportunity this would have provided) and in theend helped turn impoverished nations into vibrant nations and -- hey,it's good for the US economy -- growing markets for our goods andservices.Imagine our world today if that was what Bush had done. So howwould YOU spend $200 billion? Fully fund a Manhattan Project ofEnergy to end our dependence on foreign oil and non-renewableenergy sources in general? Truly tackle AIDS in Africa -- the greatestscourge of our time?Give us your ideas. The best response gets...well, nothing, probably.But who knows? Maybe George Soros will read it and give you a call.
