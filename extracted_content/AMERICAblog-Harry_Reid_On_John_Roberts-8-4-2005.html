8/04/2005 08:06:00 AMHave you read "The New Yorker" profile of Senate MinorityLeader Harry Reid we linked to earlier? It's worth checking out.Here's the most important stuff: Reid's impressions of SupremeCourt nominee John Roberts. Reid compares him to Souter (hislips to God's ears!) and thinks Roberts was a non-controversialchoice Bush made because he felt in a weak position. Reidinsists they named a number of people that would have hadthe Dems jumping up and down in anger and Roberts wasn'tone of them.One thing [Reid] asked [Roberts] was how he felt aboutSupreme Court precedents -- in particular, on what groundsthey might be overturned. "Precedent is so important to mein the law," Reid told him.Roberts, Reid recalled, said, "'Oh, on the Supreme Courtyou can change precedent only if there's this and this,' andhe was rattling them off. I hope I didn't act surprised, butI'd never heard anything like that before." Roberts, in Reid'sview, left no doubt that he would be very reluctant tooverturn precedents. To do so, Roberts had said, the Courtwould first have to consider a series of objective criteria,two of which stood out: whether a precedent fosteredstability in the nation; and the extent to which society hadcome to rely on an earlier ruling, even a dubious one. "Ithought it would be more of a weaselly answer thanthat, but he said you have to meet all these standardsbefore you can change a precedent," Reid said.The more I read about Roberts, the less I'm convinced. Certainly, itseems unlikely he is the sort of broad, mainstream judge that mostAmericans want -- the average Joe wants to leave radicals toacademia and think tanks, not the highest court in the land. True,Roberts doesn't seem to espouse a truly fringe judicial philosophy likeBork, just one that is very, very, very far to the right. He's not strongon voting rights. Heck, Roberts thought the Reagan Administrationwas too moderate at times and NEVER thought it was tooconservative on any issue. Not one. (If you know of one, let usknow.)Roberts seems like a far right conservative who wants to pay unduedeference to the executive and legislative branch. Doesn't Robertsknow it's "checks and balances," not "whatever you say, Mr.President"?Still, Reid has spoken to him and quizzed him and gotten someanswers that reassure him. And as we posted, Roberts did pro bonowork that benefitted the gay rights cause. I sure hope Reid is right.
