THEATER: Reviewing  The Revue Of Maury Yest on
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE THEATER: THE MUSICAL
WORLD 
OF MAURY YESTON  ** 1/2 out of ****
YORK THEATRE COMPANY  
It's no secret that Gerard Alessandrini's Forbidden Broadway  shows
are mercilessly funny valentine's to the musicals they spoof. His
genuine love for the theater takes the sting out of some pretty waspish
observations. Well, here Alessandrini plays it straight. In what may be
his first musical revue, he's crafted a classically conceived tribute to the
work of lyricist/composer Maury Yeston.
Yeston needs no boost. He's got multiple Tonys, two huge Broadway
hits in Grand Hotel and Nine  and a masterpiece with Titanic . (That
one's going to be a big hit whenever it's properly revived.) But boost
him Alessandrini does. Sure, Nine  dominates, with five of the 25+
shows on hand. In contrast,  Grand Hotel  has three, his off Broadway
hit Death Takes A Holiday  just one and Titanic  doesn't appear until
the finale, since its numbers perhaps don't make as much sense out of
context.
That leaves more than half the show celebrating songs new to most, a
far cry from most revues for artists of Yeston's stature. His work is
lovingly showcased in a pitch perfect setting. The design by James
Morgan is simple and clean, the choreography by Gerry McIntyre
modest as it should be, the lighting by Jacob Zedek supportive without
calling attention to itself, the costumes by Melinda Hare no-fuss until
they add some Forbidden -like humor and pianist/musical director
Greg Jarrett is the hardest working person in the room.
Alessandrini oversees it all with impeccable taste. The show is a tight
75 minutes, the song choices intelligently balanced, the transitions
between numbers thoughtfully done and ensemble moments balancedMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

The problem, I fear, is the cast. They let down a revue that deserves
better. With stronger performers, this revue would be a home run. As it
is, they shine best when working in groups and of course the songs of
Yeston lift them up time and again. Of course,  revues should work the
other way around.
Happily, while everyone falters at some point, they also have high
points. Benjamin Eakeley plays the leading man capably, Alex Getlin's
soft-rock vibrato is a treat the first time around, Jovan E'Sean does his
best when introducing "Mississippi Moon" and both Justin Keyes and
Mamie Parris make the most of any humor on tap. (Keyes' vocals
simply aren't up to the demands of "Sant n' Pepper" while Parris has
more to offer with her pipes throughout the night.)
Any time the cast works together the results are stronger, whether it's
the tribute-to-actors ensemble opener "Anything Can Happen In The
Theater," the sweet duet "You're There Too" (E'Sean and Keyes) or the
far more comic "No Women In The Bible," featuring Getlin and Parris.
Like any revue worth the name, this one makes you want to revisit (or
visit) Yeston's shows. Only the written to order title song feels a little by
the numbers. The rest intrigue, like his own spin on The Phantom Of
The Opera  and the four songs from In The Beginning, a Biblical romp
Alessandrini once directed in Maine, apparently. (That's a line worthy
of Forbidden !) And the finale of "Godspeed, Titanic" never fails to raise
goosebumps for me, whether during its original run on Broadway, at
my niece's high school production a few years ago (full orchestra!) or
by the cast here for their curtain call. That stirring drama will certainly
have new life someday soon. Given the quality of the songs and the
sturdiness of its construction, I'm sure this revue will too.
And fans of Alessandrini should keep an eye out for Forbidden
Broadway: The Next Generation, which re-opens at the York starting
January 15. It's one of his best.The Movies, Books, Theater,
