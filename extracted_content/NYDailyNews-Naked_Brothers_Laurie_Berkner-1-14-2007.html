The new music on kids'shows is
Snappy, nOt SapFV srr MTcHAEL GrLTz
arney is dead. Or at least, the sappy, simplistic, mind-
numbing sing-alongs that the purple dinosaur popularized:
are dead. With the cool music airing on kids TV shows all
over the dial, "This Old Man" just won't cut it anymore.
On "The Naked Brothers Band," de-
buting Jm 27 at 8 p m on N.ickelodeon,
Nat and Alex Wolff play preteen rock
stars in a mockumentary show with the
improv feel of a Christopher Guest film
In real li-fe. Nat has been Miting songs
since he was 5 (he's all of 12 now), and
he and Alexjust spent a few days rn the
studio recording nine of his tunes
Meanwhile. on "Jack's Big Music
Show," airing Saturdays at noon on
Noggin, puppets interact with people in
a mashup of every musical style imagin-
able, from doo-wop to pop to rock with
guests ranging from Lisa Loeb to mem-
bers of the Flming Lips. Even Jon Stew-
art stops by this season
And on "Johnny and the Sprites" (Sat-
urdays at I0 a m on the Disney Chan-
nel), John TartaBlia works on his music
while playing with his friends the Sprites
and singing songs by Broadway talent
Iike Stephen Schwartz ("wicked") and
the gang behind "Avenue Q "
The "Naked Brothers" show is a family
affair: Nat wolff co-stars with his broth-
er. sisier. friends and dad (jzz musician
Michael Wolff , and it's a great example
of k.ids delivering "adult'-style music
"I've been getting into a little Joni
Mitchell," says Nat, who was inspired by
her classic album "Blue" to consider a
concept album built around Hawaii The
result? His song "Banana Smoothie "
Meanwhile, adults like Laurie Berkner
go the other way: She's a regular on
"Jack's Big Music Show" and a kids' mu-
sic superstar who's already sold out two
shows at ToM HaIl in March Berkner. says the cunent state of kids music is
: even better than when "Sesame Street"
i and "Schoolhouse Rock" were cool
i "There's so much more of it and so
i mmy people who have gained the re-
i spect of the music industry and their
: fans," says Berknen "There is so much
i crossover in everv direction "
: Indeed, her songs have been heard on
: "Sex and the City" and plugged by Star-
: bucks, and bands likeThey Might Be
: Giants and artists like Stephen Menitt of
i Magnetic Fields think nothing of alter-
i nating "adult" albums with music geared
: toward kids And mNic is integral to
i shows like "SpongeBob SquarePants"
: (which has spawned soundtracks) and
i Noggin's "The Wonder Pets," which
i draws on Gilbert & Sullivan-twe music
i for its sound
i "I love feeling like I'm reaching peo-
I ple my own age as well as the kids," says
i Berkner, who began in the adult music
: world and doesn't see much difference
: betweenthem anymore "I'dprobablybe
: a better adult songwiter thm I used to
i be because of my writing for kids "
: For Nat, plalng a rockstar in a TV
: show with his pals is as cool as it gets -
: even if going to school means he has to
i put off going on tour. His dream now is to
i follow in the path of Drake Bell, another
i Nick alum who played a song-writing kid
: on "Drake & Josh," and just released his
i majorJabeldebutonMotom
i "We have Drake's album'It's Only
i Time,' it's awesome," says Nat "My .
i brother listens to it a-lmost everv hour of
i the day. I don't even think he sleeps " r)T!NY TUNES
