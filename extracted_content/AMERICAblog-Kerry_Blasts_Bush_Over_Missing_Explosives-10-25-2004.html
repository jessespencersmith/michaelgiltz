10/25/2004 12:23:00 PMKerry is making hay with Bush's tragic, it-would-be-funny-if-it-wasn't-so-scary incompetence of letting a huge cache of explosives gomissing in Iraq, even after they were warned repeatedly to make sureit was secure both before and after the invasion.The LA Times quotes Kerry blasting Bush today:""Now we know that our country and our troops are lesssafe because this president failed to do the basics," Kerrysaid, according to the LA Times. "This is one of the greatblunders of Iraq, and one of the great blunders of thisadministration. And the incredible incompetence of thispresident and this administration has put our troops at risk,and put this country at greater risk than we ought to be.""He accused the administration of "blindness," "stubbornness" and"arrogance" on Iraq, saying its failure to "do the basics" in securingweapons showed Bush had failed the test of being commander inchief.Kerry also assailed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld forhaving "cavalierly dismissed the danger of looting" when U.S. forcesoccupied Iraq. He was referring to Rumsfeld's comment about thepost-invasion looting there that "stuff happens."""Now we know the impact," Kerry said."Go get 'em, tiger.
