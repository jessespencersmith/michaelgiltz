7/29/2005 04:19:00 AMThe Republican-controlled House and Senate are getting readyto cut up to 15% of the entire country's checkpoint screenersat airports. The Senate wants to cut 6000 of the 45,000screeners; the House wants to cut 2000. USA Today detailswhich airports are hit hardest with cuts. (Some, in fact, gain).Among the big losers: Detroit (black people), Puerto Rico(dark-skinned people and Ricky Martin) and JFK in New York(lots of liberals and besides, it's in Queens and that makesthem feel icky). Among the big winners: Arnuhld's Los Angeles,Houston (naturally) and -- no surprise here -- Washington-Dulles. Shameless.Airport officials say travelers can forget about breezing throughin ten minutes -- which should be great for the beleagueredairline industry. But forget convenience -- how can thisPOSSIBLY be a good idea in a post 9-11 world where securityshould be a top priority?Has Bush done ANYTHING lately to improve national security?Bush won't even pretend to worry about oil consumption, Bushdoesn't guard our borders, Bush ignores the backlog ofuntranslated intelligence, Bush wants to DELAY upgrading theCoast Guard (which is charged with inspecting ports) until2030, Bush can't even upgrade the computers at the FBI (he'sleaving that up to the NEXT President), we STILL don't have acombined terrorist watch list to check against the names ofpeople on airline passenger lists and now Bush wants to cutback on airport security. What else can we add to this list?
