10/29/2004 02:52:00 AMThat's Bush we're talking about, of course. Bob Herbert details thelow morale of US troops in Iraq. He then quotes the work of NYTreporter Edward Wong, who interviewed many soldiers, who are bleakabout Bush's claim that Iraqis being trained will soon be ready to takeover major responsibilities."They said the Iraqi police and National Guard are unhelpful at bestand enemy agents at worst, raising doubts about President Bush'sassertion that local forces would soon help relieve the policing dutiesof the 138,000 American troops in Iraq. The marines said they coulduse better equipment from the Pentagon, and they feared that theAmerican people were ignorant of the hardships they faced in thisdessicated land."
