            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 9 ,  2 0 0 7Scooby-Doo, Instant Ramen Noodles Guy DieThe creator of Scooby-Doo is dead. I had no idea his name was inspiredby Sinatra's scatting at the end of "Strangers In the Night" ("dooby-dooby-doo") but that makes me love Scooby all the more. All I knowabout Scooby is how phenomenally popular he has been. Many yearsago, when I was factchecking some article for Premiere, I rememberspeaking with someone at Warner Bros. who was answering a fewquestions and then we got off topic talking about Q ratings (the ratingssystem that measures how well known and how popular people andcharacters are) and this person emphasized how off the charts Scooby'spopularity was with EVERYONE -- bigger than Superman and Batmanand Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts and you name it. Scooby wasbeloved by everyone with a pulse. They were making literally billions ofScooby merchandise and nothing Scooby-related had been created formovies or TV or books in years.And the Japanese creator of instant Ramen noodles has also died. 46BILLION packs and cups of the noodles his company made were soldlast year. A key to their worldwide success? Chicken. “Hindus may noteat beef and Muslims may not eat pork, but there is not a singleculture, religion or country that forbids the eating of chicken," hewrote, per the NYTimes. Poor chickens; no one loves them.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
