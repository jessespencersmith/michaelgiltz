$ Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer * * * 
OJ z Columbia TriStar, $39.95 
Hollywood is obsessed with beauty, so when an actress willingly 
makes herself appear ugly, the town is both horrified and thrilled. 
That's one reason Charlize Theron won the Best Actress Oscar 
for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wournos in "Monster." 
And by looking at Nick Broomfield's gripping documentary from 
2003 (a follow-up to his original look at Wournos in 1992, which is 
also included in this two-pack), you can also see how marvelously 
Theron captured this sadly malevolent woman's wounded 
defiance. The sparse extras include an interview with acclaimed 
director Patty Jenkins. 
NBA Dynasty Series: 
Chicago Bulls 1990s 
& Complete History 
of the Lakers 
**** Warner Bros., $49.98 each 
These two 
new jam­
packed boxed 
sets are 
everything a 
couch potato 
could hope for. 
The Bulls set 
covers their 
remarkable Michael Jordan­
fueled run during the 90s. The 
Lakers set gives an overview of 
that franchise's entire history. 
And among the extras are 
entire games, including -
Jordan;s flu-plagued comeback 
against the Jazz in '97, and 
Magic Johnson's "baby hook" 
game in the 1987 NBA finals. 
The Company 
** Columbia TriStar. $26.96 
Robert Altman's fitfully 
engaging, fictional look at a 
season of the Chicago Joffrey 
Ballet that barely even bothers 
with dance cliches like the 
new kid, pushy parents -
or anything like a plot. It's 
a triumph for star Neve 
Campbell, who was a dancer growing up. Extras include a 
commentary by Altman. 
The cary Grant 
Signature Collection **'/l . Warner Bros., $49.92 
A mixed bag of five discs, but 
it's cheaper than buying the 
three good movies seperately 
($19.97 each). So suffer through 
1947's "The Bachelor and the 
Bobby-Soxer" (with Shirley 
Temple) and the Cole ·Porter 
biopic "Night and Day" from 
1946. Then enjoy the amusingly 
undated "Mr. Blandings Builds 
His Dream House" from 1948, 
the solid WWII drama 
"Destination Tokyo" (1943) and 
the marvelous screwball 
comedy "My Favorite Wife" 
(1940). 
The Dukes of Hazzard: 
Complete First Season 
** Warner Bros., $39.98 
Daisy Duke's short shorts 
garner the extra star, but anyone 
other than a 10-year-old will be 
hard-pressed to watch these 13 
episodes in their entirety. Extras 
include.commentary on 
selected shows, a feature on Bo 
and Luke car, the General Lee, 
and a cast reunion barbecue.</p>
