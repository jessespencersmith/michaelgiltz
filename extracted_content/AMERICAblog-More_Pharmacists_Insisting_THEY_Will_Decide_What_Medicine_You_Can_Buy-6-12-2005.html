6/12/2005 01:15:00 PMThis is going to get worse and worse.An Illinois pharmacist is suing because he doesn't want to haveto fill prescriptions provided by a doctor that he disapproves of.In short: no birth control and no emergency contraceptives. (Atleast, to start with.) It offends his religious sensibilities. Heowns pharmacies in two towns and it's exactly what you'd fear:Morrison, Illinois has about 4,500 people and Prophetstown(love the name) has about 2000. So he may be close to theONLY game in town when it comes to getting a legalprescription filled.It offends his religious sensibilities, of course. The ruckus hereis mostly over the morning-after pill -- I needn't point out thatthe morning after pill can PREVENT pregnancy, meaning thispharmacist would be forcing a woman who got raped to getpregnant and therefore increasing abortions. Lovely.And why stop there. Doesn't it offend his religious sensibilitiesto sell condoms to adults who aren't married? What aboutadults who are married but are of different races? We KNOW itwould offend his sensibilities to sell condoms to a gay couple.Sorry, but if you want to be a pharmacist, you can't denymedicine to people because you don't approve of them or themedicine they're buying, any more than a real estate agent canrefuse to sell a home to black people or atheists. No one istrying to tell this fool how to behave in his own personal life.Why is he trying to make his own morality the law of the land?
