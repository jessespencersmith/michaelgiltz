Once, director-playwright Richard Foreman's career followed a pret­
ty conventional path-at one point, he even had a play titled Hany 
in Love optioned for Broadway. "I had been sort of a normal play­
wright up until 1967," he says. "But when my option fell through, I was sit­
ting at home and I said, 'This is silly. " I walk into a theater tonight, what 
do I want to see onstage?' And in as much time as this has taken me to tell 
you, I had this image of a certain kind of tension between performers and 
a certain kind of minimal language and I started doing it. Basically, I've 
been mining that moment ever since." For more than twenty years, Fore­
man has specialized in non narrative works that strive to capture what he 
calls "the nuances of the unfathomable." Today Foreman focuses on more 
intimate pieces, the latest of which-I've Got the Shak~pens January 
5. "I'm always trying to evoke what is evanescent," he says. "In this play, 
the lead character says, 'I have something to teach, but I don't know what 
it is.' And I think that's everybody's position in life. We may have one idea 
of what we're achieving, but the world ends up choosing to make use of us in ways we can't imagine." Despite numer­
ous awards (including an NEA award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theaterl, Foreman is most proud that his writing­
as opposed to his directing-is slowly garnering more attention. "When I began, people said, 'Well, he's a pretty creative 
director, but his writing is Dadaistic nonsense. Anybody could do that,' " Foreman says. "And I've always maintained 
that I'm basically a writer. I only started directing plays because when I started writing the strange kind of pieces I'm 
writing now, no one would direct them." MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
