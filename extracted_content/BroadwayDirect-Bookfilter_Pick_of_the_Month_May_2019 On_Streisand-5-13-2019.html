On Streisand: An Opinionated Guide
By Ethan Mordden$21.95, Oxford University PressPublished May 9
Barbra Streisand has never won a competitive Tony. Never! Shocking but true. She was
honored with a special Tony, and she was among the hopefuls twice — once for herbreakthrough work in I Can Get It for You Wholesale,  and a second time for Funny Girl — but a
win was not to be. Streisand’s lifelong love of musical theater and landmark recordings makeher a Broadway baby even if she hasn’t performed on the Great White Way since Christmas Dayin 1965. Indeed, her 1985 tribute to show tunes, titled The Broadway Album,  is the artistic peak

<p>concert. Why not? It worked for Bette Midler! Surely critic and historian Ethan Mordden agrees
she’s one of the greats. His impassioned book looks at Streisand’s artistry and importance from
every possible angle, adding a scholarly critique to the obsessive passion of a true fan. A goodcritic, of course, is someone who appreciates your work, but not all of it. Mordden delves intothe albums, the movies, the TV specials, and her early work in cabaret and theater. His book issubtitled An Opinionated Guide,  and opinionated ain’t the half of it. You start reading but
immediately feel like Mordden is galloping far, far ahead. He’s so informed and enthusiastic anddefensive and wide-ranging in his claims for Streisand’s talent, artistry, legacy, impact, and all-around greatness that it’s a pleasure just trying to keep up. And his insights into her key years inNew York City as she figured out who she was and how to bend the world to her vision aremany.
