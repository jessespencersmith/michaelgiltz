9/09/2005 11:15:00 AMFor those who missed Rob in Baltimore's posting late last night,Time magazine has a devastating article on FEMA hack MichaelBrown -- his resume is literally a pack of lies. This morning's"Today" show trumpeted the news and you can be certain nowBrown is toast. The lead NYT editorial blasts the cronyism atFEMA, its emphasis on pr instead of rescuing the endangeredand points out how Clinton had turned it into an effective andwidely praised agency. It's no accident Bush put incompetentliars like Brown in charge. He hates FEMA and any governmentagency -- Dept of Education, Social Security -- that helps thelittle guy.But President Bush chose to make FEMA a dumping groundfor unqualified cronies - a sure sign that he wanted tohasten the degradation of an agency thatconservative Republicans have long considered anevil of big government.And as a side note, the NYT editorial includes a link to a ChicagoTribune article on FEMA's top hacks. One more sign of blogging'sgrowing influence.
