6/09/2005 04:00:00 PMI'm truly conflicted about this one. In Miami Beach, they'vepassed an ordinance that bars convicted pedophiles from livingwithin 2,500 feet of schools, school bus stops, day carecenters, parks or playgrounds. Because of the size of MiamiBeach (just over 7 square miles) and the fact that it has 21parks and 6 public schools, the ordinance effectively banspedophiles from living in the city at all. A township in NewJersey and another city in Florida have quickly followed suitand some 40 other local governments have called to get moreinfo on the ban.Well, I sure as hell wouldn't want a convicted pedophile movingin next door to my kids. (Who would?) But, really, can everycity and town in the country simply ban pedophiles? Should wejust dump them into some commune far away from everyoneelse? Would anyone care? And why stop there? Why not ban allmurders or all felons? Can we just legislate away crime andfear?
