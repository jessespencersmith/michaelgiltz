            <p>M O N D AY,  D E C E M B E R  0 4 ,  2 0 0 6Thomas Pynchon Sighting!Thomas Pynchon -- the author who makes JD Salinger seem like apublicity hound -- hits the bestseller lists with his new book "AgainstThe Day," a door-stopper of a novel that debuts at #13 on the New YorkTimes bestseller list. It's described there as "Pynchonesque," whichseems a tad redundant, don't you think? I mean, how could a book byPynchon NOT be Pynchonesque? It's the only hint of serious fiction onthe chart, which is a little unusual this time of year. Normally, otherheavyweight authors deliver big titles, but no one is even close exceptfor Dave Eggers and Cormac McCarthy. On the nonfiction list, as Ipredicted Barack Obama's new book slides a bit after the elections andis replaced at the top by John Grisham's "The Innocent Man." And ifbooksellers wonder why sales are slow, just look at the creeping pricesof paperbacks, where even mass market titles now often cost $10. Bythe way, keep checking back for my extensive interview with ThomasPynchon, which I'll post later this week along with a video record of ourchat via You Tube and a downloadable podcast on iTunes.
