9/15/2004 02:18:00 PMThe Bush administration has spent a pitiful $1 billion out of the $18billion set aside for desperately needed reconstruction in Iraq. Now itwants Congress to approve shifting more than $3 billion of thattowards security measures.Top Republicans - like Senators Richard Lugar of Indiana and ChuckHagel of Nebraska -- are pointing out the obvious: that this is a signof a failed policy in Iraq. We're going nowhere fast.[Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE)] said the State Departmentrequest was "a clear acknowledgment that we are notholding ourselves hostage to some grand illusion that we'rewinning."Mr. Hagel went on to say that the request forreprogramming the money "does not add up, in my opinion,to a pretty picture, to a picture that shows that we'rewinning. But it does add up to this, an acknowledgmentthat we are in deep trouble."
