 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: The Opera Einstein On The
Beach Triumphs (Again)!
EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH  **** out of ****
BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC
I've had to wait 20 years to see this landmark work a
second time and still don't feel quite ready to talk aboutit. Can I see it again? Preferably not in 20 years time,but sooner?
Einstein On The Beach  is a signal artistic achievement
and happily remains as thrilling and rich an experience
today as it was when I saw it in 1992. (The piece debutedin 1976 and was also revived in 1984.) Audiences
certainly seem to have finally caught up with it. At that
1992 revival at BAM, I was astonished when a small but notable chunk of the crowd left early. Surely by
then they knew what to expect from Philip Glass  and Robert Wilson ? And yet, it was still shocking and
frustrating to those unable to adjust. Today, the piece is just as challenging.But the vocabulary it employshas become so widespread that theater-goers are ready for it. This new production makes clearer than
ever why Einstein On The Beach  reinvigorated opera; popularized the avant-garde downtown scene; and
made the careers of composer/lyricist Philip Glass, director Robert Wilson and choreographer Lucinda
Childs .
This is not a wholly reimagined production of Einstein . In essence, it is the show that debuted in 1976,
with technological changes and trims where appropriate. So I wasn't quite expecting how new andvibrant it would feel, how I would keep battling in my brain to compare the 2012 edition with the 1992edition I thought was emblazoned on my imagination forever. However, that liar we call memory fooledme again and again; in particular, one action, one tableau I remember vividly from 1992 and which hasbeen the source of an anecdote I've repeated over and over for the past 20 years actually never
happened. (Instead of a moon passing across the sky from one side of the stage to the other, it remains
in place and slowly goes in and out of eclipse.)
Other images and scenes struck me as radically different despite minimal changes. This shouldn't be a
surprise. Since Wilson pares back moments to their essentials, even the tiniest change in color or scenery
is sure to have a dramatic impact. Diving into articles about the show after I saw it, I discovered that newMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>lighting equipment meant the colors were slightly different; new tools meant sometimes the instruments
that had been played 20 years ago were now sampled; new speeds at which scenes could be changed
meant transitions could be smoother. This is absolutely the Einstein  I remember, but it is also fresh and
new and thrillingly different.
But what exactly happens for those five hours? The piece begins with a knee play, Wilson's word for the
brief front of stage actions that take place while scenery is being switched. It has its roots in vaudeville,
where a comic or duo would step to the front of the stage and do a bit while a new act set up or a newscene was put in place. Half an hour before the official curtain time, two performers are front stage left,one of them uttering random numbers and the other repeating a text over and over again. Slowly moreperformers fill up the pit alongside the musicians. The performers on stage also make a strange, odd sort
of motion with their hands. In 1992, it was merely strange and random; today, in a nice bit of
synchronicity, it looks for all the world like they are manipulating a computer's mouse. Who knows whatit will look like in another 20 years?
What follows are seven scenes or tableaux, two dance pieces and four more knee plays. A train pulls into
a station. A trial begins. A train pulls out of a station. A trial continues and prison follows. A person in a
building. A person on a bed. A spaceship lights out for the territories. A bus comes into view. The scenesare simple, iconic, even totemic. The text is seemingly random, sometimes poetic, often amusing, alwaysengaging. The dancing is thrilling and wildly challenging for the performers. The music surges and flowsand envelops it all. The result is inexplicably thrilling. I've seen plenty of avant-garde pieces where artists
struggled to combine apparently random actions and events and scenes into a coherent whole. Rarely
does it work. (There's a reason why characters and plot dominate the theater.) Sometimes, somehow itdoes cohere. If I knew why Einstein On The Beach  doesn't merely cohere but is intellectually and
emotionally powerful, I suppose I'd be making art rather than watching it. Let me see it four or five orten more times (the way I have seen and re-seen Shakespeare's plays and my favorite movies and books
and albums) and I might begin to figure it out.
Some vivid impressions.
The colors and set designs are more subtle  -- apparently they're using modern lighting that creates
an entirely new palette. I certainly didn't imagine the colors in the 1992 revival were primary, but they
had that sort of iconic feel to them. Similarly, the train pulling into the station in Scene 1 felt like TheTrain, the ideal train of our subconscious, the train that would cast a shadow on a cave wall for Plato. Inthis production, throughout, the lighting and color and sets felt just as totemic and powerful butsomehow more specific too.
Night Train is a show-stopper  -- one of the tableau involves a train pulling out of a station at night.
The changes are probably modest and, of course, I'm comparing this production to a production I saw
only once back in 1992, but the Night Train scene felt radically different and powerful. The clouds in thedark sky are riveting, the lighting more moody and mysterious and the entire event bursting with potent
meaning.
The rectangle of light  -- for me, perhaps the signal moment in this show's mysterious power is the
scene where the entire stage is plunged into darkness and we see a rectangle of light lying horizontally on
the stage. Slowly, very slowly (this is redundant; we're watching a Robert Wilson production and
everything always  happens slowly) the rectangle of light stands on end. Then, just as slowly, the
rectangle -- dubbed the "bed" by the production team -- ascends into the sky and out of sight. The music
Philip Glass wrote here is among the most powerful and moving you're likely to encounter. It's as pure anact of theater as you will ever see. At the peak moment when the rectangle of light stood on end, themusic briefly stops and the theater is hushed in silence; back in 1992 someone in the audience quietly
spoke out, "God?" and the audience tittered. It does indeed feel like a religious moment. The rectangle of
light has the majesty and impact of the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey . Seeing the show a second
time, I appreciated it more. First, we see that bright white light as a shaft of light earlier in the show. It

<p>stretches up out of sight. But when the light reappears and is contained in that rectangle of space, it
pulses with more power and authority than it did when it seemed to disappear into infinity. This is surely
as telling a detail as anything in the show, how containing and isolating something down to its essence
can make it more compelling. Further, on that pitch black stage when all we saw was this beautiful,striking rectangle of light, this time I was just as aware of the beauty and weight of the blackness thatsurrounded it as the rectangle of light itself. Surely, Wilson would approve.
The silent film aesthetic  -- perhaps it's my imagining, but this time around I felt strongly the
influence of silent movies on the set design. In particular, the interior of the spaceship (in which workers
maintain their stations in front of rows of pulsating lights) reminded me of Modern Times  and the trial
scene seemed particularly Germanic. Either one would have fit smoothly into a Fritz Lang film.
Wilson slows things down so you can truly observe them and notice things you never
noticed before  -- this is the great lie or, rather, misdirection of Wilson. He does not help you observe
and notice everything by paring events down to their essentials and embracing a deliciously glacial pace.
In fact, what Wilson does is demonstrate again and again the impossibility  of observing everything, no
matter how pared down and slowly things occur. Take the trial scenes. You might be watching a lawyer
coming in, presumably late for their case. You might be watching the marvelous stenographers at their
job. You might watch the judges pound their gavels and make pronouncements. You might watch the
witness take their place. But each movement is so absorbing that no matter how diligent you are, eventsinvariably take place and you miss them. When did the second judge leave the stage? He was there a
moment ago (okay, five minutes ago) and now he's gone. It's certainly not sleight of hand; when you do
catch a change, the judge slowly rises from his seat and exits while half of the judge's seating area slides
off with them. You're astonished that you could have ever missed such a major change, especially when
you've been staring mesmerized by this tableau for 20 minutes. But such things happen again and again.
This, I think, accounts for some of the emotional power of the show. In Night Train, that swirling, potent
scene, we are watching a train recede into the distance as two people in the last car look back at us andwave or sing a duet or (towards the end) enact a dramatic moment. Inevitably, such a scene evokes allscenes of leaving and goodbyes, whether it's heading off to college and saying goodbye to your parents ormoving from one city to another and taking leave of your friends or ending summer camp or whateveremotional goodbye sticks with you. And here we see the ultimate goodbye, acted out on stage. But no
matter how closely you observe it, no matter how carefully you try to grasp every single element and
detail, again and again you become absorbed with some action only to realize with a start that the trainthat was pulling away from the station is much farther away. When did that happen? How did you missit? You become determined not to miss it again but then a few minutes later you realize again that thetrain is even further away now and you barely noticed. You have one task -- absorb this moment
completely -- and you fail again and again. Can you ever capture a moment, freeze forever in your brain
that last bittersweet goodbye? No, you can't and that is one reason why Wilson's work has such beautyand power. He reminds you of this simple fact: everything is slipping away into the past no matter howdesperately you want to remember it. And he proves it to you again and again and again.
Sentimentality can be earned  -- I guess I'm an old softie now. Einstein On The Beach  ends with a
bus pulling onto the stage and the driver offering up a story about two lovers on a park bench, one of the
show's clearest and most straightforward moments of the evening. In 1992, I didn't quite mind it but feltthe moment was a bit sentimental. Now that I'm older I realize how earned and necessary that
sentimentality, that embrace of the simple and direct emotion can be. Twenty years from now I'll
probably see it again and be in tears.
The entire ensemble onstage, in the pit and behind the scenes is superlative. Few works are as
challenging to perform as Einstein On The Beach , both emotionally and technically, and everyone
succeeds in making this a triumph. The show continues on tour with the possibility of more dates beingadded, so keep checking here .
But let me finish by saying how absurd it is that we've had to wait so long to see it again. Robert Wilsonsays he doesn't think his work should be revived when he's gone? He couldn't be more wrong. Now that
the original creators have passed the baton on this show, let's hope more productions of their work(s)can occur and Einstein  can enter the canon instead of appearing only slightly more often than Halley's
Comet. If The Ring  can be revived again and again all over the world, why not Glass's Portraits Trilogy?
Glass never imagined he would see Satyagraha  again in his lifetime because it was sung in Sanskrit. But
so what? I don't speak French or German or Italian either. Most operas are sung in a language most
people don't speak.
I think they need Beyreuths  of their own, at the very least. They need annual festivals devoted to curating
and presenting their works under the best possible conditions. Further, I can see some of the sets from
this tour preserved as works of art in their own right. Imagine "Night Train" or "Spaceship (Interior)" on
display at Dia Beacon , the museum that specializes in presenting large-scale works; they would be on an
eternal loop with the sets in motion set to the music over and over for all of eternity. (If you've neverbeen, it's absolutely worth a day trip to Dia Beacon.) I've heard suggestions of brilliant re-purposing ofvideo of the opera in public spaces. And thank God they're filming the work. I know they've recorded a
full dress rehearsal in hi-def and 3-D. Hopefully, they'll film a live performance in both standard hi-def
and 48 fps or 64 fps like the latest movies so we can preserve this show once and for all. If Wilson feelsuncomfortable with how it looks (he needs to sign off on it), tell him to give me a call.

<p>approaching and I was astonished. What? It's over already? Surely it hasn't been four and a half hours
yet? Does the bus appear earlier and then reappear again in an hour, I wondered frantically? No, it
doesn't; the show was drawing to a close. And yes, four and a half hours had elapsed. It only felt like they
had stopped time.
POSTSCRIPT : I enjoyed an embarrassment of riches and saw Einstein  again one week later. I'm
currently working on my 80 page monograph about the show but would add these comments for the
moment. I truly felt like I saw the show for the first time. In 1992, I was just taking it all in. One week
earlier, I was taking in a new production, comparing it to my clearly faulty memory of 1992 and my
familiarity with the score and trying to absorb this monumental work in one gulp. But the second
viewing, one week later, allowed me to soak in the show (and from the ideal vantage point of dead center
and about 15 rows back, far better than I'd ever enjoyed before). Filming the show and recording it seems
as essential to me as ever: even most of the lucky few like me who got to see the show probably had seats
in the balcony or far on the side and quite frankly, it's difficult to fully appreciate the visual power of the
show without that central viewpoint. A film can offer this ideal perspective to everyone; a live
performance is always preferable but a filmed document of the show is the very least it deserves.
When you pronounce the name Albert Einstein and then send dancers spinning onto the stage, crossing
it again and again, swirling past each other, well it may be reductive but you can't help thinking of atoms
that spin around and past and into each other a la a nuclear reactor or bomb. Indeed, the late stages ofthe show include a scrim covered with technical information about an atomic explosion and its effect.You're also aware that the violin soloist dressed as Einstein is often on a chair elevated above theorchestra pit. That chair is almost always (or perhaps always, I can't be sure) on a platform roughly the
same height as the stage and often in a spotlight even when it's empty. But it wasn't until my second
viewing when my perspective changed from far, far stage left to dead center that I fully appreciated howEinstein and the dancers were on the same level, how they were dancing to the tune he played. Manyother modest insights or free associations occurred throughout the night thanks to this ideal experience.
Truly great works are never timely. You might write an entertaining play about the Wall Street meltdown
and people might  enjoy its timeliness, how it details and illuminates recent events. But if its going to
work twenty years from now, those trappings can't matter -- the play must be timeless and truly grapplewith the eternal issues of greed and morality and love and pain and tragedy or it will soon become a relic.It was only on a second viewing this go-round I appreciated how very much of its time Einstein  was: the
speech by a woman at a gathering of activists demanding equal rights (and using the very 70s expression"male chauvinist pig"), the appearance of Patty Hearst, the fear of Cold War nuclear annihilation andother seemingly random details must have made this opera seem very timely indeed, especially whencompared to say Bluebeard's Castle  or The Ring Cycle.  But they completely transmuted those details of
the 1970s so they could breathe and live on. In 1976, Patty Hearst undoubtedly seemed ripped from the
headlines, in 1984 it might have seemed dated, in 1992 perhaps ironic and today she has a symbolic
power far outweighing her historical roots. Just as you need footnotes to place some of Shakespeare'shistorical figures, but their actions on stage embody something eternal.
So I should say thank you for the rare chance to see this show twice, but instead I'd much prefer to
enquire whether I can see it again soon, maybe next March in Hong Kong?
NOTE TO LAURIE ANDERSON:  One other vast and influential work that BAM has nurtured is
Laurie Anderson's  United States Live,  which debuted in 1983. It's part of the remarkable explosion of
cutting edge but popular works that came in the wake of Einstein On The Beach  and of course Anderson
has proven one of the most enduring talents of that era. (I alluded to her work in my piece above by
saying the spaceship was "lighting out for the territories," a reference to the final track in this show which
itself echoes Mark Twain's The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn. )
Some believe returning to a work they've already done is uninteresting; going backwards rather than
forwards. But any enduring work of art can be revisited and revitalized. Surely 30 years is enough time topass for Anderson to bring back this signal work of the avant-garde? I've loved the boxed set audiorecording of the show that came out in 1984; it looms large in my imagination even though I haven't the
foggiest idea what the show itself looked like. Many artists have taken to performing their classic albums
on tour in order, finding new strength in revisiting a classic work and seeing how it speaks to them andtheir audience today. Surely Anderson could do the same with United States Live?  It might even be
United States Live 2.0,  with Anderson trimming the sections that don't speak to her any more and
adding new ones as inspiration struck.
It's not an exhumation; that wouldn't be creatively satisfying for anyone. It would be a celebration, an
embrace of the work that arose in that time and finding a way to make it speak to us today. It's the samechallenge the theater and opera face when mounting a new production of a classic work; anyone who has
seen a successful revival of a play or musical or opera knows how this pumps new blood into a great work
and keeps it in front of audiences for generations to come. Anderson's United States Live  deserves no
less. And on a selfish level, I want to be sitting in the audience when she launches into that moving,beautiful final piece "Lighting Out For The Territories," instead of listening to it in my home or in my car,alone and wondering what I missed by not seeing it performed in person.
