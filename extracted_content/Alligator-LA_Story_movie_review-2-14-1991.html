L.A. Story * * * 
Oaks 6, Plaza 
In this movie, wacky television 
weatherman Harris K. Telemacher 
(Steve Martin) falls in love with 
visiting British journalist Sara Mc­
Dowel (Victoria Tennant). But the 
real romance here is between 
writer/star Martin and the city of 
Los Angeles. 
Martin affectionately skewers 
the quirky habits of that town's in­
habitants through an endless se­
ries of satirical jabs and fantasy 
sequences. Harris gives toupee 
and car-phone advisory reports 
during his weather broadcasts. He 
also makes performance-art vid­
eos with a friend that consist 
solely of shots of him roller-skat­
ing around art objects in local mu­
seums. 
L Furthermore, Harris must deal</p>
<p>THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 14. 1921 
Steve Marlin needs a sign to tell him how to treat a lady in 
L.A. STORY. Cheez, what a goof ... Notice the full moon? 
with a trendy restaurant (L'ldiot) 
that demands a complete back­
ground check before granting him 
a reservation, a very polite crimi­
nal ("Hi, I'm Bob. I'll be your 
mugger.") and the latest craze: 
enemas. All this silliness is amusing, 
but it undercuts the romantic do 
si do between Harris and Sara. 
Other obstacles in their path in­
clude her unresolved relationship 
with an ex-husband and his dalli­
ance with a bouncy young woman named San DeE (Sarah Jessica 
Parker). 
SanDeE -who insists that her 
name be spelled in that manner 
-is this movie's freshest crea­
tion. She is constantly jumping 
around and squealing with child­
ish delight. Harris knows that 
San DeE is too young for him, yet 
he can't resist her easy-going 
manner and thoroughly uncom­
plicated view of life. When Har­
ris and she are going away for 
the weekend, he says it should 
be strictly as friends and that 
they shouldn't make love. 
"Okay," she says, "we'll just 
have sex." 
That's just one example of the 
witty dialogue in this movie. 
L.A. Story is the first writing pro­
ject for Martin since the deserv­
edly praised Roxanne. While that 
movie was breezily romantic, 
this is much better at being 
drolly amusing. 
Martin's observations about 
L.A. are invariably more amus­
ing and on-target than his in­
sights into love. Even if the 
romance is more sappy than so­
phisticated, who couldn't enjoy a 
movie that quotes a talking free­
way traffic sign almost as much 
as it quotes Shakespeare? L.A. 
Story has enough style and 
charm to overcome the gooshy 
heart at its center.
