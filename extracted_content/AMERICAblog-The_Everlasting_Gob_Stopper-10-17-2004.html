10/17/2004 01:48:00 AMWillie Wonka invented a candy -- the Everlasting Gob-Stopper -- thatkids could suck and suck and would never wear out, keeping themforever sated. Bush has invented the Never-Ending Terror Alerts.Harper's Index (in the October issue) reminds us that Bush placedour country under an "elevated terror alert" more than two years ago.How many days -- not weeks or months, but days -- has the terroralert been relaxed back to regular levels? Not one. Not one day.Surely if we are always at an elevated terror alert, then thatelevation is meaningless. It is simply the way of the world. We can'tgo back to sliding onto planes without being metal-detected orwalking into the New york Stock Exchange without passing serioussecurity.But the only purpose of flashing lights that "raise" the terror alertwhenever Bush's poll numbers fall is to terrorize the populace. (Therecent school "scare" was especially evil.) When will someone callBush on this fear-mongering?
