Cooking with Kyra 
Kyra Sedgwick talks about going to lesbian bars with her costar Julianna Margulies 
to research their gay roles in What's Cooking? By Michael Giltz _ -I've kissed Paulina 
~ ~ Porizkova, Helen Mir-
ren, and Julianna 
Margulies, " laughs 
actress Kyra Sedg-
wick. "God, people would kill to 
be in my shoes." 
The smooch with Porizkova 
came last spring during Sedgwick's 
"blink and you missed it" sitcom 
Talk to Me. Her dalliance with the 
estimable Helen Mirren occurred 
in Losing Chase, a 1996 Showtime 
movie directed by Sedgwick 's hus­
band, Kevin Bacon. Now, in the 
new movie What's Cooking? 
(which opens in New York on No­
vember 10 and in Los Angeles 
and selected cities the fol­
lowing week), Sedg­
wick enjoys a loving 
relationship with 
ER star Margulies . 
A comedic drama, 
What's Cooking? re­
volves around four 
families: a Jewish cou­
ple who are happy to 
have their lesbian daughter 
home for the holidays, as long as 
her "friend" remains just a friend 
in the eyes of the relatives ; an 
upper-class black family with 
Alire Woodard as a mother seem­
ingly at loose ends; a Vietnamese 
family featuring an unrecogniz ­
able Joan Chen as the tradition­
happy matriarch; and a Latino 
family headed by Mercedes Ruehl 
as the separated mom ready to 
date again. 
Despite other subplots involv­
ing marital strife, a loaded gun 
kept hidden by a teenager, and in­
terracial dating that gives parents 
on both sides conniption fits, the 
characters played by Sedgwick 
and Margulies are at the heart of 
the movie. They gamely endure 
THE ADVOCATE 1881 NOVEMBER 21, 2000 the questioning of guests who 
want to know when they'll meet 
the right man, let Mom (Lainie 
Kazan) come into their room in the 
morning (with the single beds still 
pushed together), and try to make 
the best of an awkward situation. 
According to the friendly and 
slightly raunchy Sedgwick (who 
perks up whenever she tosses off 
an expletive or two), she and Mar­
gulies were made for each other. 
"We both care about the same 
things," explains the 35-year-old 
New York City native. "We both 
are women who won't take a lot of 
shit from anybody. We're very in 
touch with our male sides as 
well as our female sides. 
And we're women who 
really expect to be 
treated as equals." In 
other words, they'd 
both make good les­
bians? "Yeah!" she 
laughs. "I think so." 
And Sedgwick also 
confesses to a bit of curiosi-
ty. "Honestly, I've always been 
slightly saddened by the fact that I 
had never had a lesbian come on 
to me," admits the actress, who 
currently stars off-Broadway in 
Stranger [see review, page 96], a 
new play by Craig Lucas. Since 
she's married to Kevin Bacon and 
the mother of two, Sedgwick's 
chances to be the object of a 
woman's affection seemed remote. 
Besides, when she and Mar­
gulies hit the New York City bars 
to prepare for their roles, Sedg­
wick thought there might be awk­
ward situations at the places 
where she and Margulies hung out 
as "tourists." "I expected a little 
anger, a little 'What the fuck are 
you doing here?'" says Sedgwick, 
who mentions Henrietta Hud-~</p>
