From the Publisher: "Lovers of epic rejoice! Hartsuyker illuminates these
old stories with authority and visceral detail, bringing to life theadventure, bleak beauty, and human struggle that lie at their heart. Avivid and gripping read." —Madeline Miller, bestselling author of The Song
of Achilles  "Linnea Hartsuyker brings myth and legend roaring to life in
this superbly good page-turning saga of Viking-era Norway. Hartsuyker is
fearless as she navigates a harsh, exacting, and hair-raising world, with icyfjords and raiding seasons and ancient blood feuds. But the book’s fiercest
magic shines in the characters of Ragnvald and Svanhild, as unforgettable
a brother and sister duo as I can remember in recent literature. LinneaHartsuyker is an exciting, original voice in historical fiction, and The Half-Drowned King  is nothing short of mesmerizing."—Paula…

What We Say
Debut author Linnea Hartsuyker has launched the first of a trilogy with this tale of Vikings. What better compliment can I
offer than to say I'm eagerly awaiting book two? Set in an era when Vikings roamed the seas for plunder and their land wassplit into countless little "kingdoms," the story focuses on two siblings. Rangvald is a strong warrior but is betrayed by a
step-father who wants the lad out of the way so his own, weaker sons can inherit the family estate. Another warrior -- Solvi
-- wounds Rangvald and tosses him in the sea. But our hero survives, becoming the half-drowned king of the title andvowing revenge. Meanwhile, his proud sister Svanhild -- bereft of father and now her brother-protector -- proudly flees toShare This Book

<p>avoid a forced marriage, only to find herself dependent on Solvi...and liking it. With battles and numerous leaders jostling
for power, easy comparisons include "Game of Thrones" (minus any fantasy elements) and of course the TV show "Vikings." A
better, headier comparison is Hilary Mantel's "Wolf Hall." Granted, this is a far more muscular tale with rousing action. But
the characters are notably complex and the best fun comes in watching Rangvald struggle with his own blunt nature. Alwaysa better adviser to others than for his own cause, Rangvald rises in stature almost despite himself. His sister is equallycompelling while Solvi, Oddi (Rangvald's caustic friend), Harald (the boy who would unite all the land under his rule) andothers prove just as memorable. You'll find heroes and villains aplenty but they're filled with satisfying contradictions.
Mostly, this story very loosely based on scraps of history is a lot of fun. It'll take two more novels to see if Hartsuyker can
deepen and enrich the world she's brought to life. But she's off to a very good start. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“A spellbinding evocation of a long-lost world of magic and blood feuds, populated by characters riddled with
doubt and human failing beneath their epic exteriors.” - BookPage
“Making her fiction debut, Hartsuyker, who claims descent from Norway’s first king, writes an absolutely top-
notch Viking saga, and readers will eagerly await the next two volumes in this trilogy.” - Library Journal ,
starred review
“A terrific historical epic…Posing thoughtful questions about the nature of honor and heroism, and devoting
significant attention to women’s lives, the novel takes a fresh approach to the Viking adventure genre…Theaction scenes will have the blood humming in your veins.” - Booklist , Starred Review
“Steeped in legend and myth, Hartsuyker’s debut is a swashbuckling epic of family, love, and betrayal that
reimagines the Norse sagas….While Hartsuyker’s prose is straightforward, the plot is as deliciously complex as
Game of Thrones . And, in an era so dominated by the tales of men, it’s nice to see a complicated, cunning
heroine like Svanhild swoop in and steal the show. Hold on to your helms and grab your shields—Hartsuyker…
