THEATER: "OKLAHOMA!" IS OK THE SECOND
TIME AROUND!
OKLAHOMA!  ** 1/2 out of ****
CIRCLE  IN  THE  SQUARE
Few things are as wonderfully indulgent as the chance to go see a new
Broadway show...twice! Whether you're comparing casts, looking to
deepen your appreciation or giving a show you weren't thrilled with asecond chance, returning to a work of theater before it's gone forever(and most theater disappears all too soon, Phantom  excepted, of
course) is a marvelous luxury.
I saw the dark, daring revival of Oklahoma!  at St. Ann's Warehouse
last fall and it confounded and confused me. Now I've seen it again on
Broadway and pretty much everything I said then holds true now.
Since most critics raved, that's a compliment to a show that has movedinto a new space but lost none of its edge. Indeed, I think the headysuccess of that first mounting has allowed everyone involved tobreathe a sigh of relief and enjoy themselves a little more. This
production will go dark, but it's less afraid now to have fun along the
way. My opinion hasn't changed on this take (if anything, it's beencemented) but it's a pleasure to savor the parts that go into directorDaniel Fish's vision. Some thoughts:
HELLO  TO  THE  TONY  WINNER  FOR  BEST  REVIVAL  -- In a
rather thin season, only two musical revivals have hit Broadway:Oklahoma!  and Kiss  Me,  Kate!  I enjoyed Kate  more  but there's not a
soul on the planet who is excited by it. Everyone has an opinion aboutOklahoma!  and many of them are passionate in support. It's a riskier
project based on a superior show; indeed, few shows are the equal ofOklahoma!  much less its superior. Plus, Oklahoma!  offers a lot more
talent to cheer on in both supporting roles and technical contributions.Passion will always triumph over professionalism so I'll betMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>Oklahoma!  clutches the big prize of Best Musical   Revival. (This
assumes they'll keep this category separate from Play Revival and let
these two duke it out.)
WHAT  A  GORGEOUS  REIMAGINING  OF  THE  SCORE  -- Since
we're talking about Tonys, the most deserved one should go to DanielKluger for his orchestrations, arrangements and music supervision.
The seven member orchestra (along with star Damon Daunno on
guitar) has a bluegrass vibe and the orchestrations reveal what awondrous work the music of Richard Rodgers truly is -- not that weneeded reminding. The smaller ensemble would work a treat forcommunity theaters and regional productions around the country, if
R&H would allow a classic presentation to include this more intimate
approach to the music. The Tony for orchestration hasn't gone to arevival since Sweeney  Todd  in 2006 but I'll bet Oklahoma!  pulls it off.
AND  SPEAKING  OF  TONYS,  THEY  CAIN'T  SAY  NO  TO  ALI
STROKER  -- Stroker caught my eye in the lovely, 2015 revival of
Spring  Awakening  by Deaf West Theatre. Now she's a ball on fire as
the man-loving Ado Annie. By far this show's best element is the lovetriangle between Ado, her slightly dim but lovable cowpoke Will
(James Davis) and the peddler Ali Hakim (Will Brill, picking up right
where Mallory Portnoy left off). For all my complaints about the show,what a treat they pull off here. Will becomes more than a joke, the uglyethnic stereotype that can be Ali is erased entirely and Stroker breaksdown barriers because she was the best damn person for the role...and
might just deserve a Tony for choreography, given the marvelous way
she reveals character just be the way Ado swoops and dips and glidesaround the stage in her wheelchair. All three should be competing inthe supporting actor categories. Here's Stroker and the cast
performing her comic highlight "I Cain't Say No" on The  Tonight
Show.
BLONDE  ON  BLONDE  -- It's not all good news. As is often true at

<p>the folk seated on stage by the crockpots cooking up some chili had
extra fun. This time my seat was right by the ramp where the actors
usually entered and exited. It was terrific...but it also gave me a newperspective on the set. The expanse of unvarnished wood melting intoa brown backdrop depicting farmland proved especially monotonous.
Setting the show in a barn of sorts and serving chili and cornbread
during intermission? Perfect! Still, did the overall look of the set haveto prove so bland to the eye?
KEEP  MESSING  WITH  IT  -- I may not agree with director Daniel
Fish's vision here, but I'll defend to the death his right to vision it. As
my guest said, mess with it all you want --   Oklahoma!  will survive.
This production mildly hints at a gay angle by having Curly and Judtalk so close to one another in one scene they seem ready to kiss, yetthat idea isn't taken seriously. But why not  an Oklahoma!  where the
tension between the two men arises from attraction? (The nominallove interest Laurey would have all the more reason to be annoyed
with both of them.) Or why not the idea I considered at length in my
original review: cast Jud as black or Native American  and suddenly the
outcast nature of that character makes perfect sense.
This is Oklahoma!  after all , one of the seminal works of musical
theater. It deserves to be done in a reverent, classic style; it also
deserves to have the darker shadows explored (as they were in thetremendous 1998 West End revival that turned Hugh Jackman into astar); and it deserves to be torn down and reimagined completely as it
is here. (And stop saying they didn't change a word of the dialogue, as
if staging and action and orchestration and everything else don'tmatter too. The words may be the same but the action at the climax isdramatically, substantially new.) No matter what you do to it,
Oklahoma!  will be perfectly OK, so boring old purists can just shush. I
can't wait to see the next  revival.
