All Rights Reserved.What We SayThis was a slow burner for me. I haven't read the first book with Calpurnia Tate, but dove in. At first the story ofCalpurnia Tate felt familiar and perhaps overly so: plucky young girl, small town life, lessons to be learned. But thenovels' restraint grew on me. Growing up at the start of the 20th century, Calpurnia faces a world that expectswomen to learn to sew and clean and make a good wife. If she's unlucky enough to remain single, she can alwaysteach. But Calpurnia is easily the smartest of her large family and her scientifically minded grandfather encouragesCalpurnia's curious mind. Author Jacqueline Kelly won me over by NOT having Calpurnia win others over in Rebeccaof Sunnybrook Farm style. Without making anyone a villain, we see a cousin offer up some hateful racist comments,brothers constantly encouraged not to mention given more money on special occasions (what would a girl need withmoney) and ultimately her parents simply be embarrassed when Calpurnia expresses a desire to pursue hereducation. They don't come around, nor are they painted as obstinate and cruel. It's just the way of the world, arather satisfying tack for a children's book to take. What seems a simple story becomes subtly complicated by theend. You don't doubt Calpurnia will be stopped but neither are you fooled into thinking spunk and being right will beall it takes for Calpurnia to triumph. I look forward to reading the original book in this series and -- undoubtedly -- thenext. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayThe Evolution of Calpurnia Tate: “The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate is the most delightful historical novel for tweens in many, many years. …Callie’sstruggles to find a place in the world where she’ll be encouraged in the gawky joys of intellectual curiosity are fresh,funny, and poignant today.”—The New Yorker, “Book Bench” section “In her debut novel, Jacqueline Kelly brings to vivid life a boisterous small-town family at the dawn of a new century.And she especially shines in her depiction of the natural world that so intrigues Callie . . . Readers will want to crankup the A.C. before cracking the cover, though. That first chapter packs a lot of summer heat.”—The Washington Post “Each chapter of this winning . . . novel opens with a quotation from ‘On the Origin of Species’—a forbidden book thather own grandfather turns out to have hidden away.  Together they study Darwin’s masterpiece, leading to arevolution in Callie’s ideas of what she might accomplish on her own.”—New York Times Book Review“Callie’s…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
