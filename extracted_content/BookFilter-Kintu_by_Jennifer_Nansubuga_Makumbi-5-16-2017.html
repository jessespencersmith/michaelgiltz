What We Say
A great novel. When the first comparisons that spring to mind are Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years Of Solitude"
(because of its sprawling multi-generational cast and need for a family tree) and Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart"(because that was the standard the author says she was shooting for), you know two things. One, this book is not set in the
suburbs of America. And two, it's really, really good. Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi's debut is set in contemporary Uganda
and begins with a seemingly random act of violence. Then we jump back in time hundreds of years to when Kintu Kidda is aleader of his people and must journey to the capital of Baganda and pay homage to the latest ruler of the kingdom. ForShare This Book

<p>some 90 pages, we are enthralled by this unexpected terrain, a world where traveling across a desert is a life-fraught risk
and a smart man like Kintu must make peace with his need to husband many wives (too much bother!) and play dumb so he
can escape the fallout from the invariable replacement of one ruler by a brother or cousin or son too impatient to wait for
nature to take its course. This section is alive with vivid characters, like the twin wives Kintu is burdened with in marriage(he loves one and is ultimately forced to accept the presence of the other). Extended families, fatherless children, peopledriven out by their own tribe but too proud to adopt another -- it's all vivid and new but so rooted in human nature wealmost forget the book began with a violent crime in 2004. But suddenly (reluctantly, really, since I'd happily have spent the
entire book in this world) we are wrenched back to the present. The cast of characters grows and grows and eventually we
realize that a curse threatened hundreds of years ago has taken root in the lives of all these people who are linked by bloodto one another and to Kintu back in the past. Twins and incest and sin and Western education and language and AIDS andmodernity and the pull of tradition -- all of these jumble up against one another in beautiful fashion. Words that echo withmeaning for Ugandans but are mere totems to us spring up time and again. Sometimes we come to understand them; other
times we simply understand that it is one more example of why we should remain humble when trying to grasp this world
of meaning and culture. So many great characters come to life, from a boisterous Great Aunt to orphans who tenaciouslysurvive to a couple that take rides in buses and then harangue their fellow passengers with the Good News of Jesus todeejays and on and on. It's a rich novel and if about three-quarters of the way through I got a little lost as to who was who
and how they related to one another (the family tree this book would benefit from is not included) well, it didn't matter. I
simply accepted: this is the person I am with now and soon we'll be on to someone else and eventually it will all makesense. And it did, culminating in a tumultuous family gathering, a grand clash of past and present, parent and child, faithand tradition, old and new that was thoroughly satisfying. Makumbi is reportedly celebrated in her country for havingdelivered the great Ugandan novel and no wonder. A collection of short stories and a second novel she's working on can't
come soon enough, but boy do they have a tough act to follow. -- Michael Giltz
