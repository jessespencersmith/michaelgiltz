Aliens, monsters and killers welcome —
meet the mind behind Midnight Madness
Sept. 22, 2010  | 9:25 a.m.
The floor popcorn from the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival  has all  been swept
up, but before   we close the book on the signature cinema event, Hero Complex contributor
Michael Giltz  brings us a look at the fanboy spirit of the festival.
Midnight Madness , a nightly dose of horror, sci-fi, Hong Kong action and other genre
favorites, is one of the most distinctive and entertaining features of the Toronto International
Film Festival, which just came to a close this weekend. The mastermind behind it is ColinGeddes, who has been programming the celebration of B-movies for 14 years (one year as co-programmer and the rest solo).
“Every night at midnight at the film festival we show some weird, wild film from around the
world,”   said Geddes, chatting just hours before the screening of the Hong Kong police actioner
“Fire Of Conscience ” brought this year’s program to a close. “We kind of throw the art-house
pretensions out the window. The films are just there to entertain and have fun.   Of course, it’s
still art. But it’s kind of much more of an entry level to enjoy the excitement of a film festival.”
2010 was a banner year for Midnight Madness, with nine out of the 10 films world premieres
and several of the movies making major noise in the market. “ Super ” (starring Rainn Wilson

<p>as a regular Joe who turns himself into a caped crusader) was the first movie snapped up at the
fest,   and “ Insidious ” (starring Patrick Wilson ) was another success story.
Rainn Wilson in
“The program started in 1988 and was designed initially for those films that don’t seem to fit the
festival definition,” said Geddes, who lives in Toronto with his girlfriend and is known for his
enthusiastic, crowd-pumping introductions to the movies he’s selected. “Over the years, we’vehad a lot of remarkable talent start there and break out of there. Peter Jackson , Eli Roth ,
Takashi Miike  all started in Midnight Madness. This year we’ve got Takashi Miike with ’13
Assassins’  in the Masters program. He started in 1997 with ‘Fudoh: The New Generation.’
It’s nice to see this director who comes back every year with a new film be recognized as themaster he is.”
Mark Hartley , the director of   “Not Quite Hollywood ,” a documentary about the Aussie
exploitation-film business that played Midnight Madness, and “ Machete Maidens
Unleashed ” (which played this year in the main festival) is another talent who appreciates the
boost Geddes provided to his work.“What’s great about [Colin] is he really
cultivates a sense of camaraderie amongst
the filmmakers,” said Hartley, who
revealed that Geddes was the first personhe sent a rough cut of his current feature.“Toronto is a gigantic  film festival, and
you can easily get lost there, being afilmmaker there. But the way Colinorganizes things, there’s a really collegial
feel about being part of the films that he
programs.”
Geddes beamed at the idea of succeeding
in creating a bond among the artists and
between them and the festival.
“I try and make them realize, you’re now
alumni,” he said. “We want you to comeback. If you bump into this director, shake
his hand because he broke his cherry atCurse of the Spider-Man? Fourth

<p>Midnight Madness as well. The films that
we get, the directors are a certain breed, acertain type that like this material and aregenuine film lovers.”
As is Geddes, who is thrilled that TIFF allows him to program movies outside of his bailiwick of
Midnight Madness. He’s helped select Russian musicals and heartfelt animated films (last year’s“My Dog Tulip “) for the main festival.
Geddes is also the director for ActionFest , a new festival launched in April in Asheville, N.C.,
that is dedicated to all things action. Geddes was a savvy choice, because he immediately givesthe festival a legitimacy and access to his Rolodex of top genre directors around the world. Thefirst edition gave a lifetime achievement award to Chuck Norris , but stars are not the focus of
ActionFest.
“This festival is about the people behind  the camera,” Geddes said of ActionFest . “The stunt
people. Let’s give the second unit and action directors credit because there’s no Oscar for stunts
or second unit. Without those guys, films are nothing. We’re really trying to make a case for that.These guys need to get their respect or due.”DC  Deadpool  Dean Haspiel  Deborah Vankin

<p>So yes, Geddes loves all types of movies. But he’s more likely to have read the parody “ Pride
and Prejudice and Zombies ” rather than Jane Austen’s  original classic. And for a long
time to come, he’ll be there every year at Toronto, touting his latest find in what he deprecatingly
calls glorified show-and-tell.
Maybe, he suggests, it’ll be time to hang it up “if I’m still  doing Midnight Madness when I’ve got
a paunch and I’m balding and I call myself Uncle Midnight.” He ran with the vision: “‘ I’m Uncle
Midnight – the kids like the boobies and the gore ,’” he growled in an imitation of a cheesy
late-night local-TV horror movie host.
He laughed and added: “I’ll do it as long as it keeps being fun. I never want to waste their time
or money. If I can’t get excited about it, how can I select it? I like that my passion shows, and
hopefully it’ll be a little bit contagious.”
