7/25/2005 02:50:00 PMSorry, but I just have to keep talking about the article Johnposted below. He was rightly aghast that Sen. Roberts ofKansas is laughing off national security and treating the covertstatus of agents as a joke. But what really astonished me wasthe context of his comments: as threader acanadianreaderpointed out, Roberts is mocking Valerie Plame's status as acovert agent who risked execution if caught overseas (nodiplomatic immunity) and made contacts around the worldwhose lives have also been endangered by her outing.The Senate Intelligence Committee will conduct hearings onAmerican spy agencies' use of cover to protect theidentities of intelligence officers, the committee chairmansaid on Sunday....Larry C. Johnson, a former C.I.A. analyst who organized theletter, said in an interview that "there are lives on the line"in the leak of an operative's identity, because foreignersknown to have met with the operative may come undersuspicion.But another former C.I.A. officer, Reuel Marc Gerecht, calledMs. Wilson's cover "very, very soft" and said cover "is theAchilles' heel of the agency." He said cover is too ofteneasily penetrated by foreign intelligence agencies.It hardly needs to be penetrated by foreign intelligence when Roveleaks the info to the press.Message? Joe Wilson's mission was a joke because his wife sent him.And Valerie Plame wasn't "really" a covert agent, just a glorified deskjockey.I assume Roberts also thinks classifications like Secret and Not forForeign are a joke as well. This administration is declaring open waron the CIA. Why doesn't the head go on talk shows and denouncethis dangerous attack on national security and the men and womenwho risk their lives defending it?
