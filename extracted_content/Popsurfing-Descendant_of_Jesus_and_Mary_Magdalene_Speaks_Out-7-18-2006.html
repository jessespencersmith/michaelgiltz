            <p>T U E S D AY,  J U LY  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6Descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdalene SpeaksOutNaturally, given her august lineage, she writes thrillers. I don't knowwhat's sillier: this author's claim that she is a descendant of Jesus andMary Magdalene being used as a marketing hook for her thrillers, herpublisher's willingness to use it or publications like USA Todayrepeating them despite the fact that the woman doesn't even TRY toback up her claim. Of course it would be impossible for her to PROVEwhat she says, but I would at least expect the woman to produce sometattered family document or maybe a family Bible with a geneology treein it or SOMETHING. At least her statements are more entertaining (Iassume) than her book could possible be: 1. "Everyone's going to thinkI'm on The Da Vinci Code bandwagon, but I'm not," says McGowan. 2.'Trish Todd, editor in chief at Touchstone, a division of Simon &Schuster says she has no problem believing McGowan's claim that shedescends from a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. "Yes, Ibelieve her. Her passion and her mission are so strong, how can she notbe?"' Oh well, then. 3. Though McGowan says she is descended fromJesus and Mary Magdalene, she won't say whether she, like thefictional Maureen, is "The Expected One." "I'm not grandiose aboutthis, and it concerns me a lot that I could be portrayed that way,"McGowan says. "I don't want it to appear that I'm standing up andsaying I'm the expected one. That's a dangerous, ego-driven kind ofthing." Thank goodness for that.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
