Scribbling the Cat: 
Travels With an African Soldier 
By Alexandra Fuller 
The Penguin Press, 256 pp., $24.95 
By Michael Giltz 
Special for USA TODAY 
Alexandra Fuller can't get out of Africa. She was 
born in England but spent most of her young life in 
war-torn Zimbabwe (then called Rhodesia) and later 
Malawi and Zambia. The troubled continent has been 
the source of her literary inspiration. 
Fuller's best-selling memoir, Don't Let's Go to the 
Dogs Tonight, vividly depicted her childhood after her 
father went off to war. The women and children who 
were left behind learned to fire guns, apply first aid 
and save a bullet for themselves if worse came to 
worst. , 
Now, a return to Africa to visit her folks brings Full­
er in contact with K, a banana farmer and battle­
scarred veteran of those conflicts. Curiosity scribbled 
the cat (slang for killed), but Fuller can't help herself. K 
is a compelling character and she soon persuades him 
to take her on a tour of the sites 
where he fought. 
K is a frightening, fascinating 
man - a born-again Christian 
prone to violent outbursts, cry­
ing jags and troubled dreams 
(because of, presumably, the 
atrocities he committed). Al­
most immediately, K decides 
that Fuller is the wife God in­
tends for him, and Fuller plays 
By Margaret Bonner along. K's war buddies are just 
Fuller: Has gone 
from Dogs to Cat. as memorable, especially Ma­
penga, who lives on an island 
with a "pet" lion that seems 
determined to make a meal out of the author. 
Dogs, written from a young girl's perspective, didn't 
bother pointing out the obvious: that Fuller's parents 
held racist views and were wrong to support Rhode­
sia's minority-ruled government. She tries to main­
tain a certain impartiality in Scribbling, but now that 
she's an adult, this fence-sitting is tougher to pull o[ 
In addition, the country's black population comes 
off as just colorful background for much of this book. 
The history and politics of the country's wars are rare­
ly broached. So the curiosity that scribbled the cat 
doesn't seem quite curious enough. 
That Mapenga's righthand man on his island was 
once a soldier fighting against bim is surely worth 
more than a passing mention. But when Fuller is 
sheepish about admitting she's a vegetarian, you give. 
up hope she'll dlallenge these men's deepest beliefs. 
Still, her descriptions of these soldiers of mis­
fortune are provocative and vivid, And one thing is 
clear: K and others like binl are marginalized and out 
of power; a-uel, capricious governments treat them 
with a wary disdain; and the world at large pays them 
no mind.</p>
