'" z Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray star in "Lost in TranslatiQn." 
"LOST IN TRANSLATION" 
"AMERICAN SPLENDOR" 
Let's swim against the tide a bit. Bill Murray is lovely and 
Sofia Coppola's second film is a definite improvement over her 
debut. But "Lost in Translation" ($26.98, Universal) is a modest 
little movie at best and its shaky humor (the lounge band; the 
mangled English of the Japanese) plays poorly at home. "Ameri­
can Splendor"!s an awkward, unsuccessful blend of documentary 
and fiction just to tell the tale of office schlep Harvey Pekar 
($27.95, HBG). Still, Paul Giamatti and Hope Davis keep it hon­
est. 
"GlLUGAN'S ISLAND": THE COMPLm FIRST SEASON 
"Gilligan'S Island" ($39.98, Warner Bros.) indulges our love of 
slapstick comedy while detailing the Sisyphean struggle of the 
castaways, who repeatedly discover new ways of getting off the 
island only to find themselves right back where they started at 
the end of every show. Bleak, Brechtian ... actually, it's just a 
very dumb comedy you loved as a kid but probably find unwatch­
able as an adult. The first season is best, if only because these 36 
black-and-white episodes weren't played to death in repeats and 
seem fresher. 
THE DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS COLLECTION 
This six-movie set ($99.95, Kino) will certainly rank as one of 
the DVD events of the year. True, Douglas Fairbanks wasn't as 
good-looking as that upstart Errol Flynn or even his own son. But 
he laughed and bounded through classic silent adventure films 
like his 1920 breakthrough "The Mark of Zarro," 1924's lavish 
"The Thief of Baghdad" and what was the definitive "Robin 
Hood," circa 1922 -till Technicolor and Flynn stole it away. Ter­
rific extras, including home movies, outtakes, intros by Orson 
Welles, clips from other films and even text from a book Fair­
banks wrote. Great fun. 
"MRS. MItlIVER" 
There's no better movie for bucking up the spirits than that 
1942 wartime classic "Mrs. Miniver," which has a finale so stirring 
you'll rush to enlist. It's just one of a clutch of genuine classics 
coming out, including Charles Laughton' S memorable "Mutiny on 
the Bounty" from 1935; Robert Donat's sentimental "Geodbye Mr. 
Chips"; the grand "Grand Hotel" from 1932; and a new edition of 
the 10ver1y "My Fair Lady," from 1964 ($19.98 each, with "My Fair 
Lady" at $26.99, Warner Bros.). 
Also out: 
Producer /on-screen interviewer Roger Friedman 's labor of 
love about soul music, "Only the Strong Survive," ($29.99, Mi­
ramax) has some great performances, especially by Mary Wil­
son; 1988's "Rain Man": Special Edition ($19.98, MGM) proves 
Tom Cruise is better when not trying to be likable; anyone antic­
ipating Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" should watch 
Robert Bresson's austere, moving "Diary of a Country Priest" 
($39.95, Criterion) from 1950 to see a revelatory look at spiritual 
faith; "The Gods Must Be Crazy" I & II ($29.95, Columbia Tri­
Star) includes the 1981 slapstick comedy, its 1989 sequel and, for 
Coke, one of the best product placements of all time; scandalous 
at the time, 1983's "The Thorn Birds" ($29.98, Warner Bros.) 
seemS almost happily old-fashioned as Richard Chamberlain 
struggleswith temptation for Rachel Ward; Jim Henson's non­
Muppet films never got the accolades they deserved, especially 
"Labyrinth" Collector 's Edition ($49.95; Columbia TriStar), a 
memorably off-beat fantasy starring David Bowie and Jennifer 
Connelly circa 1986; Hey, hey, hey, "What's Happening": First 
Season and "Good Times": Second Season ($29.95 each, Colum­
bia TriStar) are just out, along with the British sci-fi cult comedy 
"Red Dwarf" III and IV ($34.98 each, BBC). 
Out next week: 
"The Lion King IV," focuses on Timon and the irequently flat­
ulent Poomba; Lucy LawleSS kicks Sapphic butt in "Xena": Sea­
son Three; and Ingmar Bergman is happy (OK. Jess gloomy) 
tbanks to the debut of "The Ingmar Bergman Collection."</p>
