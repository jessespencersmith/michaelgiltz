8/24/2005 11:42:00 AMIn today's Washington Post, Gary Hart blasts the war and theDems who supported it and are afraid to say they made amistake:History will deal with George W. Bush and theneoconservatives who misled a mighty nation into a flawedwar that is draining the finest military in the world,diverting Guard and reserve forces that should be on thefront line of homeland defense, shredding internationalalliances that prevailed in two world wars and the Cold War,accumulating staggering deficits, misdirecting revenue fromeducation to rebuilding Iraqi buildings we've blown up, andweakening America's national security.But what will history say about an opposition party thatstands silent while all this goes on?... In their leaders, theAmerican people look for strength, determination andself-confidence, but they also look for courage, wisdom,judgment and, in times of moral crisis, the willingness tosay: "I was wrong."To stay silent during such a crisis, and particularly to harborthe thought that the administration's misfortune is theDemocrats' fortune, is cowardly....The real defeatists today are not those protesting the war.The real defeatists are those in power and their silentsupporters in the opposition party who are reduced torepeating "Stay the course" even when the course,whatever it now is, is light years away from the oneoriginally undertaken. The truth is we're way off course.
