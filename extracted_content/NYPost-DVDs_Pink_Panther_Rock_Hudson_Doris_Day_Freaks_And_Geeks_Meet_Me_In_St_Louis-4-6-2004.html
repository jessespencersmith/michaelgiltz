THE PINK PANTHER FILM COllECTION 
ROCK HUDSON AND DORIS DAY 
ROMANCE COLLECTION 
Think Pink! This Pink Panther collection ($69.96, 
MGM) offers five movies (including two 1964 clas­
sics, "The Pink Panther" and "A Shot in the Dark," 
and the 1976 "The Pink Panther Strikes Again") -but 
not the franchise-reviving 1975 entry "Return of the 
Pink Panther." To compensate, you get a new half 
hour documentary. with everyone from Blake Ed­
wards to Peter_Sellers' biographer Ed Sikov, and six 
cartoon shorts, all in a nifty black vinyl case. Rock 
Hudson and Doris Day star in a pink boxed set with 
three movies -the Oscar-winning (for writing) "Pil­
low Talk" from 1959. and two other frothy collabora­
tions -as well an eight-song Doris Day CD, all at a 
bargaln price ($29.98, Universal). 
"FREAKS AND GEEKS": COMPLETE 
SERIES 
Fans still lamenting the 2000 cancellation of 
"Freaks and Geeks" after only one season have reason 
to rejoice. Here are aU IS funny and delightful epi­
sodes ($69.98, Shout) with great music (from Styx in 
the first episode to the Grateful Dead in the last) and 
a tremendous cast (including stars in the making 
Linda Cardellini and James Franco, not to mention 
the intimidating Busy Philips and the De Niro-like 
Martin Starr). TV doesn't get any better than this 
and neither do DVDs, thanks to copious extras like 
29 (0 commentary tracks, audition footage, promos 
and loads of bloopers and deleted scenes. 
"MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS" SPECIAL 
EDmON 
Movie musical moments don't get any better than 
Judy Garland singing "The Trolley Song" in the clas­
sic 1944 charmer "Meet Me in St. Louis" ($26.99, 
Warner Bros.). It comes bursting with extras like an 
intro from Liza Minnelli. three documentaries, audio 
commentary from Margaret O'Brien and others, a 
deleted musical number and even the pilot of a TV 
series spin-off. Also just out: four other GarlalJ.d mov­
ies, including 1938's "Love Finds Andy Hardy," for 
$19.98 each. 
"IN LIVING COLOR": SEASON ONE 
Keenen Ivory Wayans masterminded this in­
stantly successful sketch comedy show ($39.98, Fox), 
but Fox drove the series into an early grave by airing 
it two or three tinles a week until Wayans finally left 
in disgust. But that doesn't dim the pleasures of 
sketches like Homeboy Shopping Network, Men on 
Film and Homey the Clown. Loads of talent on­
screen, including Damon Wayans, David Alan 
Grier, Jennifer Lopez as one of the Fly Girls and Jim 
Carrey -who got second billing after Keenen. 
Also out: 
Merchant Ivory's commercial breakthrough "A 
Room With a View" Special Edition ($26.99, Warner 
Bros.); Steve Martin's gotta-pay-the-bills work on 
"Cheaper by the Dozen" ($29.98. Fox); more celebra­
tion of "Sesame Street's" 35th birthday via "What's 
the Name afThat Song?" ($12.98, Sony Wonded; the 
deflating final episode of the Keanu Reeves silliness 
"The Matrix Revolutions" ($29.95, Warner Bros.); 
Steve Guttenberg's mom's favorite "Police Acad­
emy" Complete Collection ($59.98, Warner Bros.); 
and Ross McElwee's eccentric "Sherman's March" 
($2995, First Run).</p>
