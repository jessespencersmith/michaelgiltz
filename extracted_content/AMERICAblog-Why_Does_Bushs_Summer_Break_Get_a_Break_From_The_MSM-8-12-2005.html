8/12/2005 02:00:00 PMReally, why isn't the media lambasting Bush every day fortaking an extended vacation while the violence in Iraqcontinues to mount? I recognize that a President can stay intouch electronically and do his work from Air Force One or anylocation on the planet. But the idea of taking a long, leisurelyvacation would be outrageous if Bush hadn't already loweredthe bar so dramatically that we don't even expect him toattend a single funeral for a fallen soldier.Mr. President, Americans think you're doing a terrible jobhandling the war in Iraq. They think you lied to convince thenation to support the invasion. And the insurgency is strongerthan ever. Given all that, how can you possibly justify taking anextended vacation? Most Americans get two weeks a year. Doyou really think the President should take five weeks off whenwe're at war?
