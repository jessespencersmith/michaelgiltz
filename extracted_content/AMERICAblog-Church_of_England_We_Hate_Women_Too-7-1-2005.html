7/01/2005 02:33:00 PMNever mind that women have been ordained in the EpiscopalChurch for decades. Never mind that women are dynamicallyserving communities all over the world. Never mind thattheologically everyone agreed long ago that once you beganordaining women the question was over and women bishopswere inevitable.Now, the radical right members of the Church of England --who were always furious women have been treated as equal tomen -- are now striking out and threatening schism if anywoman becomes a bishop.And why not? Attacking Christians who want to serve othersbut happen to be gay has been a bonanza for the radical rightmembers of the Church. They've been able to turn their backson the Church's most salient characteristic -- a warm,open-hearted approach to theology that leaves room fordifferences and for different parishes to proceed at differentpaces -- for the close-minded narrow idea that we alreadyunderstand God completely and couldn't possibly ever gain inthat knowledge through prayer and discussion.The far right has been able to destroy amity and peace withinparishes, urging people to break with their friends andneighbors, ignore Church law, attack the loving authority oftheir bishops and reach out to other radicals anywhere in theworld who are willing to close their hearts and minds. Withsuccess like that, why would they stop the progress of thepresent? Now they want to roll back the advances of the past.Yes, this is the Church of England and not the Episcopal Churchin the US (which already has female bishops and, of course, anopenly gay one). But the independence that has alwayscharacterized the worldwide communion of the EpiscopalChurch is clearly under attack. And if they can succeed inEngland, the fringe members will certainly have a dramaticimpact on the US.Up next: a reappraisal on slavery.
