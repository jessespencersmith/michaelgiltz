 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Matthew Broderick's New
Musical Is Modestly 'Nice Work'
NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT  ** out of ****
IMPERIAL THEATRE
Everyone knows that the hardest part of creating a new
musical is writing good songs. A good tune will let
audiences forgive a host of ills in the book and sets and
costumes. So if you begin by plundering the vaults of
George and Ira Gershwin, your task should be much easier. All you need to do is whip up a frothy, silly
plot; cast some charming leads; string together those standards and -- voila! -- you've got a hit show.
Heck, they did it 20 years ago with Crazy For You.  Let's do it again!
Nice Work If You Can Get It  proves that it's not as easy as all that.
They have the silly plot. It's about a millionaire playboy named Jimmy destined for his fourth doomed-
to-fail marriage when he falls head over heels in love with a tough-talking but lovable female bootleggernamed Billie. She uses his weekend mansion to stash some hooch, his potential in-laws include a NewYork Senator and a Prohibitionist who can smell liquor a mile away and everyone sings and dances andwoos the night away.
They have the charming leads. Kelli O'Hara has gone from strength to strength in South Pacific and The
Pajama Game,  to name just two recent successes. As Billie, she sings like an angel, dances with aplomb
and shows a flair here for physical comedy. Matthew Broderick is Jimmy. It must be said: he has a
modest voice and isn't much of a dancer, but somehow he has willed himself into a genuine musicalcomedy star and we love him. The audience is always on his side and if there are any jokes in the book,he'll land them like a pro. He walks on stage and you smile. He dances awkwardly and you smile. Hisvoice fades a bit on the big numbers and you smile.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>The problems, funnily enough, start with the songs. Needless to say, if these were original songs we
heard for the first time, your jaw would drop with delight. But we've heard these songs a thousand times.
First, you have to earn  the right to use these tunes. They don't give you a free pass; in fact, they increase
your burden. You can't just plop the songs in anywhere and by gosh, they better fit the moment or they'llfeel random.
For example, very early in the show O'Hara sings "Someone To Watch Over Me" after meeting the
wealthy Jimmy (Broderick). She sings it beautifully, of course, and it's a standard in every sense of the
word. But does it fit this character at this moment? I suppose you could pretend we're seeing another
side of her and I'm being too picky, but everything we've been told about Billie and most everything we'll
see for the rest of the show is that she's a plucky, self-sufficient gal with a better head for business than
he'll ever have or want. She doesn't need protecting and someone better watch over their jewels or she'll
swipe 'em, thank you very much. The incongruity of this character singing this song is turned into a joke
by having her cradle a rifle. But she doesn't need a rifle; what Billie needs here is a song about refusing  to
be in love, about standing on her own two feet and not needing a man to rescue her. She's no princess in
a tower and what Jimmy loves about her is exactly that: her independence and smarts
She does it again in Act Two when Billie sings "But Not For Me." At this point, I guess I should accept
that she's a secret romantic but really I was thinking after hearing these two songs and the title tune, whydidn't they just revive Crazy For You?  (That show contains all three numbers.) The placement of the
songs began to feel random; any tune could be sung by any characters in any order and it wouldn't matterterribly much.
This wouldn't be so important if every other element of the show were strong. The sheer quality of the
tunes should win you over. But that's hardly the case. The story wisely gives all the secondary characterstheir own storylines and motivations. The dim-witted bootlegger Duke (Chris Sullivan) lets Jeannie(Robyn Hurder) believe he's an English duke and about to become King of England. (It's that kind ofshow.) The clever Cookie (Michael McGrath working overtime) finds himself posing as a butler to keep aneye on their hooch but inexplicably falling for the alcohol-despising, moralistic Duchess EstoniaDulworth (Judy Kaye). Plus everyone is wondering who the mysterious Brown Beard might be, thebootlegger running the whole show that none of them have ever unmasked.
Amidst all this craziness, the show forgets to put any real obstacles in the way of Jimmy and Billie. His
fianc√©e Eileen Evergreen (Jennifer Laura Thompson, trying hard to channel Madeline Kahn) becomes anafterthought; right at the finale she becomes a daddy's girl who demands her way a la the ending of theclassic comedy Arthur , but it's too little too late. And for much of Act Two the romance of Billie and
Jimmy fades into the background while all the other lovers elbow their way into the spotlight. Duchess
and Cookie have a big number together and then in the blink of an eye they have another  big number
together. And then they reprise it again a little later. Plus, they forget the first rule of comedy: threes. A
modest but effective gag involves playing "Rhapsody In Blue" for a brief moment when two people kiss.
They do it once. We laugh. They do it twice. We laugh.... And then they don't do it a third time?
At least they were being over-ambitious with the script. The sets by Derek McLane are under-ambitious.
The world for these glossy musicals about the frivolously rich should be glamorous and appealing.McLane had money to burn on Follies, Ragtime  and How To Succeed  and those shows benefitted. Their
sets were clever ( Succeed ), protean ( Ragtime ) or at least eye-popping ( Follies ).
Here the elements are perfunctory at best. Some architectural touches at the mansion jut out at the frontof the building and also jut out when you're in the back. A squat, ugly fountain dominates one dancesequence but since it was so prominent and unprepossessing I assumed the jug held so prominently bythe statue which pointed directly at the audience would somehow come into play. Surely there was somepurpose to this and water or confetti or champagne or something  would splash out of it? Alas, no; it's
merely squat and ugly.
Jimmy's bedroom is an orange-ish fever dream with stripes on the walls and ugly patterned curtains and
unseemly bedcovers all clashing and fighting with one another for your attention. It's not tacky enough tomake some point about Jimmy's cluelessness when it comes to nice things and how he needs a woman'stouch. (Though God knows, the room certainly does.) it's just distracting. A lack of imagination prevailsthroughout with the finale taking place in a narrow space at the front of the stage with a so-so backdropto indicate a change of scene before they wheel out that fountain again and sing "They All Laughed,"

<p>which at least includes a line about taking a bow to make it fit.
The costumes by Martin Pakledinaz are generally better, though a would-be comic moment with chorus
girls popping out of a tub wearing bubble-draped clothing isn't much of a sight gag. In general, the gals
are dressed sexily and appealingly, though why they ruin Billie's cute maid outfit with an ugly paper hat
is beyond me. (Just take it off, Kelli.) The male dancers fare less well. They're introduced as the vice
squad of that enemy of demon rum, Duchess Dulworth. They guys come out in Guys & Dolls -style
gangster suits with wide pinstripes. it was so out of appearance with their task as enforces of morality
and the law, I imagined it was a clue. Was the Duchess in fact the Brown Beard, that mysteriousbootlegging boss? Nope, it's just an odd and misleading choice of clothing.
Director and choreographer Kathleen Marshall has done better work. That vice squad comes out onstage
in a weird, blocky move with their arms held awkwardly at their sides, teetering back and forth likerobots. I'm not quite sure why, even when it was reprised later. One deft touch was placing the maledancers on the floor and have Broderick slide across them like a pastry on a conveyor belt.
In Marshall's defense, Broderick seems awfully limited, perhaps because of back surgery? His charmingly
awkward dancing worked well in that 1995 revival of How To Succeed  and when playing the nerdy
accountant in The Producers . But this show calls for a genuine leading man who can sing and dance.
Broderick has charm to spare and Marshall works around him as much as she can. But during at leastone big dance number with O'Hara, it felt as if we were watching a run-through where Broderick wasmaking sure he had his moves down and would amp up the energy when the real performance began.
All that said, with this cast and those songs, it's not a bad night at the theater, just a disappointing one.
It's quickly forgotten but you won't be miserable while watching it. How could you, with Brodericksqueezing every laugh he can out of Joe DiPietro's book and O'Hara singing like a lark? The supportingcast do their bit with energy. Judy Kaye doesn't don a lampshade but she does swing from thechandeliers to goose up the energy and Michael McGrath is a good foil. If there was more of a show tosteal, they'd steal it. Everyone else appeals, with Hurder in particular lingering in my mind with sexappeal and spunk for a much bigger role.
And a few touches worked quite well. They turned "By Strauss" and "Sweet and Lowdown" into a
competitive duet between the Duchess and Cookie that puts those two standards in a fresh context. Best
of all is the silly, throw-away scene where Broderick serenades O'Hara with a ukulele and a collegiate
contingent of Whiffenpoof-like singers pop in out of nowhere to provide backup. It makes no sense, it's
goofy and illogical and it's a quiet delight that captures the charm they were probably shooting for all
along.

Good thorough review -- I like it when a critic takes the time to describe the sets and costumes.
The consensus of this and other reviews I've read are pretty much what I expected. But, hell, I'd pay
a hundred bucks to watch Kelli O'Hara defrost her freezer. I fell over-the-moon in love with her in
"South Pacific" and I'll follow here anywhere -- even to "Nice Work If You Can Get It" if necessary.
04:58 PM on 05/11/2012
Thanks for commenting. I don't always have useful comments to make about the technicalelements, but try to remember there's more to a show than just the stars and the songs.You'll certainly have spent your money well if you're a fan of O'Hara; she's a lot of fun asalways and yes, South Pacific was one of the best revivals I'd seen since Carousel almosta decade earlier and O'Hara was a big reason.
