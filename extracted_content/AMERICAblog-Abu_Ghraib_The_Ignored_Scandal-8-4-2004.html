8/04/2004 02:06:00 AMHere's an excellent article from "Rolling Stone" on Abu Ghraib. Yes,we've all heard about the abuses, but this one gets access toclassified documents and will -- or at least should -- make you angryall over again. It details widespread abuses, high level officials whoare implicated but still in power, and the successful foot-dragging ofPresident Bush that is keeping Congress from digging into this. Unlike9/11, there are no families to hold everyone's feet to the fire. Thearticle convincingly states that the abuse was not directed atimportant terrorists and wasn't "frat-style" pranks as Rush and otherswould have you believe. Tossing people out of cars, peeing on them,shoving sticks up their rectum, rape -- it's really a catalog of horrorsand only the low-level soldiers caught on camera are paying theprice. The article also details the miserable, frightening conditionsthese soldiers were operating under -- not an excuse for them, butcertainly one more thing for their commanding officers to answer for.Get angry and email your representatives to look into this, email yourlocal paper and ask if there's any truth to this and why don't they dofollow up stories. The mainstream media is again dropping the ball.
