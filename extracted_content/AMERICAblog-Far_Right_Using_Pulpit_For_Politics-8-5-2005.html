8/05/2005 01:05:00 PMA scary story in USA Today about how the far right continues toorganize among evangelical Christians and uses the pulpit forpolitics -- especially to organize attacks on the freedoms ofAmericans they don't like. You wouldn't think these fringeradicals could get more organized, but apparently they haveonly begun to network. And the religious voice on the left?Muted and scattered. Some disturbing details:Pastor Russell Johnson paces across the broad stage as hedecries the "secular jihadists" who have "hijacked" America,accuses the public schools of neglecting to teach that Hitlerwas "an avid evolutionist" and links abortion tochildren who murder their parents....The Ohio effort isn't unique. Johnson's project -- which hesays has signed up more than 900 pastors in Ohio duringits first 10 weeks in operation --? has helped spawn theTexas Restoration Project in Bush's home state. Thefledging Pennsylvania Pastors' Network has signed up 81conservative clergy so far. Similar efforts are beginning topercolate elsewhere....John Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron,calls the networks a new chapter in an effort to organizeconservative clergy that began with the Moral Majority aquarter-century ago, then faltered...."We as Christians need to take a stand as to what ourbeliefs are," Linda Stoffer, 50, a bank loan officer, says afterthe service in Canton. Her top concerns are gaymarriage and abortion. "And life issues," adds herhusband, Dave, 54, who works in a cabinet shop. "Like,what was her name? Terri Schiavo.""We sit back and let it happen," Jean Wuske, 77, says. "Weneed to be more vocal --? let God back into places heshould be, like in the schools...."Tax-exempt churches and organizations can't endorsecandidates or be formally tied to a political party. Johnsonnotes that the Ohio Restoration Project aims to do morethan register voters. Each pastor who joins also promises tosign up 100 "Intercessors" to join an e-mail prayer chainand 200 "Minutemen Volunteers" to work in communityprojects."I like to say I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, I'm aChrist-o-crat," declares Pastor Rod Parsley, a supporter ofthe Ohio Restoration Project and head of a similar venturecalled Ohio Reformation.
