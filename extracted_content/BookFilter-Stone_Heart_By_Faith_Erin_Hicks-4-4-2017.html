What We Say
This is book two in the Nameless City trilogy and you are definitely plunked down right in the middle of the action. No
question about it: you need to go back and read book one, The Nameless City by Faith Erin Hicks. Then you'll be glad thesecond of these graphic novels is waiting for you, rather than having to wait almost a year like the rest of us! It's a big
story, so hold on. Centuries ago, an imaginary city sits at the crossroads of major trade routes. For many years, three
powers have battled over this city. Each time one of them gains control, they rename the city in their own image. Thenafter a few decades, they're toppled and someone else takes over and renames the city yet again. The locals have given upShare This Book

<p>and simply dub their home The Nameless City. In Book One, we met two young people from vastly different realms. Kaidu is
the bookish son of a warrior whose country rules over the City. Rat is a street urchin who found refuge among the monks
when Kaidu's army slaughtered her family. Somehow, they become friends and are caught up in the endless political
machinations that one finds in any Empire. After an assassination plot climaxed book one, this entry dubbed "The StoneHeart" focuses around the library/home of the monks that gives it this title. What's so effective here is how Hicks hascreated such rich characters who play off one another in unexpected ways. Kaidu may be a bookish lad who refuses to seethe citizens of the Nameless City as trash, but his warrior father is actually quite sympathetic to his son's attitude. (It's the
boy's mother who is the real warrior and savvy power broker.) Attempts to share control of the city with the other two
major powers is met with derision and distrust both inside and out the City, not least among the warriors who don't fancygiving up power. Rat and Kaidu are always at the heart of things, but they don't have so much sway or ability that we seethem as superheroes: they are simply young people desperately trying to stay above water in a world that is crashing downaround them. It's exciting, vividly drawn and where the heck is book three? Think of this as a young adult graphic novel
equivalent to the alternate histories written by Guy Gavriel Kay. Those who criticize Hicks for misappropriation of historical
facts as if this were some Oriental stereotyping are confusing condescension with creativity. Yes, this is an historical worknot set in any particular Asian time or place and it does make use of elements from different eras and societies, albeit withrespect and specificity. Its panoply of characters of every race and hue (and heroes and villains on all sides) clearly shows a
respect for genuine peoples and cultures that any reader will absorb and then hopefully pursue on their own with interest. -
