8/05/2004 02:26:00 AMAn article in USA Today about Bush courting the Catholic vote endedwith this bit of statistical foolishness:"The latest USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll shows Kerry leading Bushamong Catholics, 50%-46%. The margin of error is +/-4 percentagepoints, and when that is factored in, they are in a virtual tie."Uh, no. When the margin of error is factored in, that means theactual vote could be a virtual tie OR Kerry could have a commanding8 point lead. If the poll was 50%-50%, would they say that if themargin of error is factored in it means Bush is ahead by 4 points?Duh, people.By the way, Bush was speaking at a Knights of Columbus rally, and asa practicing Catholic I'm embarrassed by that far right group and as agay man I'm embarrassed by the very silly costumes they arewearing. Check out the photo.
