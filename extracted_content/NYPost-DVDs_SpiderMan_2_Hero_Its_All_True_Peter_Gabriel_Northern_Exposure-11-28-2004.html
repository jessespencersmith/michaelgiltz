Hero *** Miramax, $29.99 
JET Li is the martial-arts hero 
fighting for the future of ancient 
China in this art-house version 
of an action fIlm. Rather static, 
most of the story is told in 
flashbacks. While the fights are 
not always exciting, they are 
gorgeous. The fights are 
extraordinary to look at, making 
"Hero" one of the most beautiful 
fIlms of the year. 
It's All 'D'ue *** Paramount, $14.99 
DID Orson Welles sabotage his 
brilliant career with childish 
behavior and mercurial projects? 
Or did Hollywood sandbag the 
genius because he was too 
frighteningly talented and 
arrogant? This documentary 
looks at his first great 
boondoggle. A South American 
jaunt, it resulted in an 
unfinished film, the death of an 
amateur actor and the 
butchering of Welles' second 
feature, "The Magnificent 
Ambersons," when he left the 
editing to the studio to fly south 
of the border. Fascinating and 
frustrating, just like him. 
Peter Gabriel -Play ***'/'2 .. Warner, $19.99 
NO artist has done more to Spider-Mall · 2 
Special EDition 
**** Sony, $29.96 
"THE Empire Strikes 
Back." "Superman II." 
"Tarzan and His 
Mate." Yes, "Spider­
Man 2" joins these 
classics as another 
example of a sequel 
even better than the 
original. Tobey 
Maguire anchors this 
heartfelt, witty fIlm 
about the hapless 
Peter Parker with a 
sensitive, convincing 
performance that 
deserves an Oscar 
nomination. Loads of 
extras, including a 
look at how they 
fIlmed the visually 
striking villain Doc 
Ock. 'Nuff said. 
explore and expand the 
possibilities of music video 
than Peter Gabriel. This 
collection gathers all his 
innovative work in a smashing 
new sound mix that takes full 
advantage of home theater 
systems. "Sledgehammer," 
"Shock the Monkey" and more 
than 20 others are here. Also 
just out: Ray Charles rocking 
Brazilian TV with a short live 
concert in 1963's "0 Genio" 
(Rhino, $14.99) and Eric 
Clapton gathering some friends 
for a guitar fest in "Crossroads 
Guitar Festival" (WEA, $29.99). 
Look for B.B. King, James 
Taylor, Joe Walsh and many 
more. 
Northern Exposure 
SeasonlWo **** Universal, $59.98 
LIKE "Freaks and Geeks," this 
hit show is quirky and original, 
with music 
absolutely 
essential to 
the story. 
Getting the 
rights to all 
those songs 
is why this 
small batch 
of episodes 
is so 
expensive. It's worth it for this 
gentle comedy about a kvetchy 
New York doctor, played by 
Rob Morrow (above), who is 
stranded on assignment in 
oddball Cicely, Alaska.</p>
