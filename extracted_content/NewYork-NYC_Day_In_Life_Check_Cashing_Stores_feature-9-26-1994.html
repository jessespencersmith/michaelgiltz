Cashing the Check 
EVERY WEEK, PEOPLE FILE INTO THE CHECK­
cashing store at 470 Amsterdam Avenue, 
a bclow-streel-Ievcl location with blue 
walls, white tile noor, and black ceiling. 
They come for as many reasons as there 
are colors in the room, but they all want to 
make sure they have enough cash for the 
weekend. Some don't have bank ac­
counls; others don't want to wait for a 
check to clear before gelling the cash they 
need. A beefy man in his forties stands in 
line. He wears black pants with one leg 
rolled up to his knee, an olive vest, and a ragged olive hat. Presumably homeless, 
he's here to pick up an electronically de­
livered welfare check. "You can pick it up 
at any check-cashing store they desig­
nate," he explains. Is there a fee? "No, 
there's no fee because it's a government 
check." Does he Jive on the Upper West 
Side? "You could say I live in this area," 
he answers politely. One young black 
woman standing in line says simply, "[ 
don't like banks." She moves past the 
support pillar decorated with Lollo ads, 
declining to give her name. Along the wall 
are notices in English and Spanish about 
Western Union, along with a chart detail­
ing the fees for cashing checks, and re­
minders that bills for Con Edison and 
NYNEX can be paid there. Woodie Cren­
shaw, who lives in the West Eighties, 
comes here all the time, preferring to pay 
her phone and electric bills in cash. "I like 
to know the bills are paid. I pay it and I 
know it's done." Later, a well-dressed 
woman with reddish hair who is wearing 
her sunglasses indoors is arguing/plead­
ing at one of the windows. "This is from 
the largest Jewish foundation in New 
York," she says about her check. "Please. 
Listen, I'm desperate; I don't even have 
enough money for wherc I'm going. I have 
no way to get money. The young guy 
cash.ed one last week. The foundation 's ill 
the phone book." Fin<llly, she gets wh<lt 
she wants. "Thanks, you're a doll," she 
says. "Thank you, honey." 
New York City has 416 licensed 
check-cashing stores, but some people, 
like Jesus Abreu, use them only under 
unusu<ll circumstances. (Abreu has liter­
<Illy jus/ moved here after accepting an 
internship at McCall's, and he doesn't 
have a bank account yeLl "I've just 
moved up from Miami," he explains <It 
one of the service windows , "and I'm 
living in New York and I was wondering

trads off as the woman studies his 
check; a few minutes later, he leaves 
empty-handed.</p>
