Strip Masterpiece "Pogo" Gets Dee-luxe Treatment!
POGO: THROUGH THE WILD BLUE YONDER -- THE COMPLETE SYNDICATED COMIC
STRIPS VOLUME 1 BY WALT KELLY  ($39.99; Fantagraphics )
For many years, the comic strips that deserved legendary acclaim had to be taken on faith. We can watchold movies and TV shows and listen to classic albums and read great books. But practically speaking,many classic comic strips hailed as influential, ground-breaking, hilarious and the like were simply
unavailable or in such a bastardized and incomplete form that it was nigh on impossible to judge them
fairly. Even something as wildly popular as Peanuts  wasn't really available to read from start to finish the
way you would with any other work of art.
No more. We're finally seeing comic strips receive the attention and care they deserve. Classic works likeMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>Krazy Kat  and Gasoline Alley  (aka Walt And Skeezix ) and Prince Valiant  and yes Peanuts  are receiving
or have received gorgeous reprints in multi-volume sets that for the very first time since they first
appeared in newspapers or magazines lets us appreciate the work and see how it's stood the test of time.
The latest to be lovingly restored is Pogo , Walt Kelly's strip that I have dutifully recognized as probably
one of the greats (according to everyone else, at least) though I'd never seen so much as a single panel of
it. Fantagraphics  has made the wait worthwhile with Volume 1, which covers strips from October of 1948
through December 31, 1950. The book is bursting with useful, entertaining extras, from a foreword by
Jimmy Breslin to an in-depth introduction by Steve Thompson that helpfully spells out Kelly's life and
the history of the strip to footnotes (called Swamp Talk) by R.C. Harvey. The heart of the book are the
daily strips presented with six days of work on every two page spread with the color Sunday comics in a
separate section followed by the early daily strips for the New York Star before Pogo was syndicated.
Here's a look at this gorgeous, enjoyably hefty volume.
That's all well and fine. The book is lovingly made and the strips presented with care and pleasure. But is
it any good? Oh yes. It's funny and charming, bursting with witty wordplay and vivid characters you loveimmediately. You can see the influence the Marx Brothers and Krazy Kat  and Mark Twain had on Pogo
and its love of silly grammatical puns and Southern dialect. And you can see the influence Pogo  had on
Doonesbury  and Calvin & Hobbes  in its playful recognition that it was a comic strip ( Pogo  acknowledges
letters about the strip just as Doonesbury  would occasionally open a mail bag to answer reader letters)
and gentle humor. The lovably grumpy Porkypine is surely a cousin of Eeyore and (later) Oscar theGrouch. Pogo even ran for President, with the catchy slogan of "I Go Pogo" to counter "I Like Ike."
In short, read Pogo  and you can immediately see it slide into the pop cultural matrix and how it drew
upon the work that came earlier, moved forward the art form of comic strips and influenced artists after
it for generations to come. But most of all you'll laugh and savor catch phrases like "We have met the
enemy and he is us!" (surely the strip's most famous) as well as Southernisms like "Dog my cats!" and thelike.
Pogo  is famous for its political satire but in this first volume the denizens of Okefenokee Swamp are
(swiftly) defining themselves. Some modest teasing of newspaper reporters and elections don't really
square with the image I had of the strip, but that is surely yet to come. Here we engage in simplerpursuits by Pogo Possum, Albert the Alligator (forever swallowing -- by accident -- fellow critters),Porkypine and the rest. They dive deliriously into baseball in October, take care of a stray pup, search forthe Fountain of Youth, try to convince little critters to go to Owl's new school ("It's Saturday!") and so on.
Whether they go digging in the dirt for a square root for math class or insist it ain't cricket to hit a
baseball with your tail ("Who's playing cricket?" shouts Albert the Alligator as he rounds the bases. "Lookout for Home Run Baker!"), the heart of this first volume is Kelly's delight in language and Southern
improvements on it. MIlwaukee is "fraught and ree-plete" with cows and other Western wonders. When
Albert tries to learn his numbers he insists that eleven follows seven. "Like the night the day...seven comeee-leven. Anybody knows that!" (The teacher gives up, graduates Albert and makes him a truant officer.)When Owl suggests Pogo actually break some of his New Year's resolutions instead of being a do-gooder,Pogo asks what kind breaks easy. "Any kind I makes," says Owl. "Man, I is got resolutions left over fromlast year what I isn't even had time  to break yet!" Pogo responds, "Bring a couple over, size 6 1/2."
Here's a New Year's resolution for you: dive into Pogo, one of the best comic strips of all time. You don'thave to take my word for it anymore; you can read it yourself.
