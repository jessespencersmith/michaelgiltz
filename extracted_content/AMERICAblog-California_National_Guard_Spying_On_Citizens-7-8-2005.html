7/08/2005 12:43:00 PMOur National Guard is stretched dangerously thin. Butapparently some politicos think it would be better used to spyon the widows and children of veterans. The US military isinvestigating whether the California Guard -- the country'slargest NG unit -- is being used to spy on citizens. That's thesame sort of tactics the gov't used when protests heated upover Vietnam. This comes in the wake of public hearingsplanned in the state by a Congresswoman, so presumably itsmeant to stave off closer scrutiny. Nothing to see here; keepmoving. Per SFgate:The National Guard intelligence unit came to publicattention after a story published Sunday in the SanJose Mercury News. The story referred to the unit'smonitoring of a Mother's Day anti-war demonstrationat the state Capitol that was organized by severalpeace groups — the Gold Star Families for Peace,Raging Grannies and CodePink.An e-mail chain that began in Gov. ArnoldSchwarzenegger's press office culminated in anadvisory a few days before the protest from Col. JeffDavis, who oversees the National Guard unit: "ourIntell. folks ... continue to monitor" the event.Hart said the monitoring amounted to recordingtelevision coverage and reading newspaper articlesabout the protest. He said the unit did not infiltratethe groups or observe the rally.And why the hell would members of the National Guard spendtheir days "recording television coverage and readingnewspaper articles" anyway? That's their defense? Does thatseem a valid, useful way to spend time in the war on terror?God knows there aren't any ports to guard or shippingcontainers to inspect.
