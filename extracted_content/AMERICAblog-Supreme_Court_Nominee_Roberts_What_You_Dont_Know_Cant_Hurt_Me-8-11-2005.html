8/11/2005 02:30:00 AMJudiciary Chairman Sen. Specter says it's fine by him if Bushwants to hold back documents from when Roberts was workingfor Bush I. The argument -- attorney client privilege is invoked-- is rather specious. Instead of debating the issue of what andhow much should be disclosed from a nominee's career, onecan't help wondering, What are they trying to hide? After all,Bush's people admit they're going slow on releasing otherdocuments because they don't know what's in them that mightcause controversy. Nonetheless, more and more info is spillingout about Roberts and his career.The Washington Post details how Roberts helped Sandra DayO'Connor formulate a non-answer on Roe v Wade and hismany, many formulations of far right positions during theReagan administration.The New York Times describes a meeting between Roberts andSen. Wyden of Oregon. According to the Senator, Robertsexpressed displeasure with Congress interfering in the case ofTerri Schiavo (he'd be an awfully poor candidate if he DIDN'Tsee Congress's cynical grandstanding as terrible), cited adissent by Brandeis on "the right to be left alone" (an earlyprecursor to the idea of a right to privacy, which the far rightwants to believe doesn't exist) and admitted Roe v Wade is"settled law" for an Appeals Court Judge, but that doesn't reallyapply to SCOTUS.Those hearings are going to be humdingers. So do you likeRoberts more or less or the same as the day he wasannounced?
