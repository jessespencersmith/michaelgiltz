 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyMovies: The Top 100 Films of All
Time and the Best of 2011
The IRA Film Awards are the most prestigious,
mysterious and exclusive movie awards in the world.Long after the frenzy of "awards season" has passed, themembers of the IRAs meet to soberly discuss, debate,argue, bicker, fight, and mock each other as they decidewhat truly are the best films, performances andtechnical achievements of the previous year. They alsoshine a light on some of the worst achievements in
cinema.
The IRAs were founded in the 1970s with one very simple thought: we've got better taste than those other
award shows; let's do our own. And thus the IRAs were born. Its ranks have contained future Oscarwinners, acclaimed and best-selling authors of both fiction and nonfiction (especially movie history),power players in the studio system, influential members of the media, hardcore cineastes and the teambehind Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards, the most acclaimed (really, theONLY acclaimed) awards book in history and the template for all the ones that followed in its wake.Usually composed of 10-20 members, the IRAs spend their year watching and debating the movies thatreally matter, the ones they hope will last and then share their judgment with the rest of the world.
This year the IRAs voted on both the best films of 2011 and the best films of all time, a laborious and fun
process that involved catching up with classic movies, debating and arguing them and multiple rounds ofvoting. The result? A list none of us are truly happy with, naturally. I bemoan the lack of animated films
and just one documentary that made the cut. Others are embarrassed by the omission of Bollywood. And
so on. But it's a good list: watch all 100 films and you will have a good grounding in some classic cinema.
It happened for me. I somehow had never caught director Max Ophuls. Now The Earrings Of Madame
De...  is high on my personal list of the best movies of all time. Same with the ground-breaking, revelatory
Jeanne Dielman. So debate and mock the list, but do watch the movies you've never seen before. Enjoy!
And tell me, how many of the movies on this list of 100 have you seen? (I had to see 20 of them for thefirst time before the final vote and I see a lot of movies!)

Don''t forget Warren Beatty's "Reds". So well done, with part of it done in documentary/interview
fashion. "Young Tom Edison" with Mickey Rooney is a delight too and so is Rooney.

Since the anniversary of the sinking is upon us, the best film and a terrific one about the Titanicwas the British version, "A Night To Remember". Done in stark black and white, it's brilliantlyeffective with fine performances all around.
09:32 PM on 03/28/2012
Oh, I agree. It's just come out in a new edition on Criterion which I'll be reviewing this weekor next. A Night To Remember is a very fine drama and certainly the best film based onTitanic.Recency   | Popularity Page:  1 2  Next  ›  Last  »  (2 total)

I want to get it but it's pricey. I'll wait until Amazon has it for less later on.

Anything directed by David Lean should be at the top of anyone's list.
09:33 PM on 03/28/2012
Marvelous director. I have Lawrence Of Arabia and Great Expectations on my short list and
this week I'm reviewing his collaborations with David Lean. (I've never seen In Which WeServe and am looking forward to it.) Have you ever seen Hobson's Choice? Another
delightful Lean film (one of his best) and yet it slips through the cracks even for fans.
10:46 PM on 03/28/2012
Seen "Hobson's Choice". "A Passage To India" was wonderful too, even if Lean
did Alec Guinness a favor and casted him in a role he was unsuited for, just asLean cast Gunness as Zhivago's brother. he   was too old for the part and miscast.
Judy Davis made it well worthwhile though.
"Doctor Zhivago" is really a film a I watch over and over. i saw it on my new TV set
which is LED instead of the plasma I had and you really get a different perspective
on films with that. That glossy film aspect isn't there so it looks as if you're seeingit live in some scenes. Lean really had to edit that one down because in the bookYuri Zhivago is involved with three women, not two. In the book, he becomes astreet person, lost in the chaos of Russia and is picked up by a woman who he
has an affair with. Lean cut that out because he believed American audiences
wouldn't believe a man could be involved with three women when married to oneand having an affair with another. As with all Lean films, the cinematography is justsuperb.
02:05 PM on 03/28/2012
Instead of listing movies that should be here, I'm just going to whine about the ones that are. Rulesof the Game? Really? I found it dull to the point of throwing my head on my desk in agony. AndThe Searchers? What? What movie were these people watching?! I wanted to shoot myself to
avoid the pain. It was ridiculous and good for a laugh- not laughing with it, laughing at it. I know
this is being very dramatic, but oh my god. At least the second group here gave Singin In The Rainsome well deserved love.

Well, thanks for swimming against the tide and pointing out the movies you didn't like on
the list. Of course, one would be hard pressed to find any list of the Top 100 movies of all
time from any critics or directors poll that didn't include The Searchers or The Rules of the
Game. But you're ahead of my mom, who had never even heard of Rules. How many films
on the list have you not seen? And how about sharing your full list of the 100 best movies
of all time?
12:56 PM on 03/28/2012
I saw "The Tree of Life" and it deserves every award it received above including, if not especially
cinematography. It was the kind of film Stanley Kubrick would have made if he were still alive and
on top of his game. For me, that's the highest compliment.
But attempting to decide the top 100 films of all time are amongst thousands over the course of a
century is a fools errand that will always end up being completely subjective. Simply glancing through the above list points this out as the titles near the top seem to be olderfilms and yet as a new art form cinema is still advancing/evolving to this day. Many people
romanticize older films but pre 1960 movies are often technically and artistically inferior to more
recent ones.
02:07 PM on 03/28/2012
clearly never seen Kane!

Technically and artisitcally inferior to modern film? Hardly so, unless you love those CGI FX
which often look like CGI FX. Take a highly popular classic like "The Charge of the LightBrigade" with Errol Flynn. if anything, the charge at the end is worth it. It was shot so well
that you're riveted to the screen and can almost hear the raging thunder of horse hoofs.
Flynn actually rode that horse too. The studios then put out more intelligent scripts then weget today too. They catered to a a more mature audience, unlike today where the studioscater predominately to a teen crowd.
07:40 AM on 03/29/2012
Simply by the fact that film was still in it's infancy as an art form even into the1940's and 50's means the aesthetic was completely different than more moderncinema. The acting and dialogue of those older films seems stiff and stilted bytoday's standard so even a beautifully shot film by Greg Toland like "The Grapes of
Wrath" seems inhabited by cartoonish characters.
Comparing films pre and post 1960 (just to pick one cutoff point) is like comparingapples to oranges, it just doesn't work.Also your comparing the top 5% of films made in the "studio era" to ALL filmsmade now is not fair. Of course classic films seem better now as we only reviewthe cream of the crop, not the hundreds of dreck pics (or "b" pictures) churned out
by the studios.Permalink  | Share it

Thanks for commenting everyone. I'd be the first person to start naming all the movies that are NOT
o the list. That's half the fun. But not one of you named how many of the movies on the list you hadseen or more to the point how many movies you hadn't seen! I had to watch 20 of the movies oncethey made it onto the final list and saw a lot of great films I'd never seen before, like Dreyer's Ordetand Day Of Wrath and Chantal Ackerman's Jeanne Dielman and the terrifically entertaining noir OutOf The Past. I hope instead of falling back on your old favorites like we all do, that you'll use the listto explore some great films you've never seen before., If you do, you might just discover that some
of them make it onto your all time best list as well.

West Side Story is a superior musical and film to Meet Me In St. Louis. I've never heard of the IRA
awards...seems like it's one guy with a blog??
03:55 PM on 03/28/2012
West Side Story is a great musical though the IRA voters are not keen on Robert Wise ingeneral. they're auteurists through and through. It's a very casual collective that began inthe 1970s among Columbia film buffs, as I detailed in my intro. It's no formal group a la
NYFC or an established poll a la Sight & Sound. It's no more or less "real" than you and
your friends doing the same thing every year. But they've been doing it for decades (Ijoined in 1991) and their ranks have produced people with the accomplishments I'vementioned. You can go to the link above and check out their awards over the years, someof which I vehemently object to (but they've gotten better since I joined :).
07:47 PM on 03/28/2012
To me it's a work of art. The staging of the dance scenes is so fantastic and theset design and art direction, perfect to me, particularly the colour palette theychose with the purples, reds and mustard yellows. The music I LOVE and other
than casting Natalie Wood (who was great, but the pitch of her voice was too
different from Marnie Nixon's who sang for the role of Maria), I thought the castwas amazing. Rita Moreno and George Chakiris were wonderful!! Robert Wise wasonly a co-director, Jerome Robbins is credited as directing as well. I like Meet Mein St. Louis, it's a sweet film...but top 100? Not to me.

A white bread and mayonnaise actor with dark make-up playing Tony is not my idea ofTony in "West Side Story".   "Meet me In St. Louis" had everything and that special Minnelli
touch,. The sets, color and songs and the simple yet very powerful story worked all aroundto perfection. The film was a picture of not what actually was how we perceive nostalgia.

This list is a real head scratcher. Roughly ten post-1970 movies on the list? As mentioned below,
no Coppola? No Coen brothers? No Spielberg? Lucas? Hell, I'd put The Breakfast Club well aheadof The Searchers and neither of those films would make my top 100. That's 40+ years of movie
making and industry innovation that's being ignored. There are some classics on the list, but
Victor/Victoria, The Palm Beach Story, Kiss Me Deadly,? Hell, Once Upon A Time In The Westwasn't even one of the top three best Sergio Leone films. No David Lean? No Peckinpah? Forshame!!
09:38 PM on 03/28/2012
The bias on the list was def towards movies that had stood the test of time. A very liberalgroup in some matters but very conservative in others. I certainly have Raiders and ET andClose Encounters (which gets better and better in my estimation every time I revisit it) andEmpire among my very favorites, along with the two Godfathers and Miller's Crossing. But Iunderstand the desire to go slow and letting movies from the recent past prove themselvesover time first. And tell me, how many movies on the list have you not seen yet? I'll bet
your list of your 100 favorite films would point me towards some movies I'd love. Hopefully
ours can do the same for you.
09:49 AM on 03/29/2012
Michael, thanks for your reply. I've always intended to compile a list of my top 100films of all time. I have about 50 right now. A daunting, fluid, subjective prospect.Quite honestly, there are plenty of films on your list that I have not seen (The
Earrings of Madame de, Jeanne Dielman, The Decalogue among others). So,
thank you. I'm excited to spend upcoming nights watching the movies on your listthat I've not seen.

Where is "The Wizard of Oz" or "Ben Hur" or "Lawrence of Arabia"?
12:19 PM on 03/28/2012
Wizard and Lawrence are on my personal list.
12:21 PM on 03/28/2012
Oh and you won't find The Wizard Of Oz or Ben Hur on the Sight & Sound poll of critics all
over the world -- the most respected list of its kind. Not on their top ten list and not on their
expanded list of every movie that got multiple votes. I agree with you on Wizard but justwant to point out this list isn't the only one that lacks your favorites.
09:53 AM on 03/28/2012
I'd be tempted to replace "The Crime of Monsieur Lange" with the woefully underrated "Dude,Where's My Car?" Otherwise, a perfect list.
03:56 PM on 03/28/2012
Def on the short list of greatest film titles of all time.
09:43 AM on 03/28/2012
I understand lists such as these always make for some fun debates and the criteria can vary wildlyat times. Not every movie aficionado is going to be happy with them. And there are some damngreat movies here. But seriously, not one Coppola movie. The man is responsible for three of the
greatest movies of all time (The Godfather I & II, The Conversation) and possibly a fourth
(Apocalypse Now). Lang's Metropolis is obvious but no M? I have no problem with controversy so tospeak, but not if it's just for the sake of it. Really, as the other posters have asked, and if you'llallow me to quote another great movie ignored here (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) "Whoare these guys?" and what is their criteria. It seems to me that "What we have here is a failure tocommunicate" (Yes, Cool Hand Luke is another pretty big miss here too.). Ah well, time to pull outone of my Coen brothers DVDs (I'll be happy to send a copy as they seem unfamiliar with them
also), make some popcorn, and be content with my own personal best collection. Long live the
cinema.

but not Apocalypse Now. (Not every movie can be on a list.) With 100,000+ movies
released in the past century, you'd be surprised how quickly the list fills up and great films
like Cool Hand Luke are reluctantly set aside. This group has its biases -- they love Dreyer
but ignore Bergman, for example. So does every other group which might include three
Coppolas but ignore Ozu or Dreyer. But tell me: how many movies on the list have you
seen?

100,000 people would come up with 100,000 different lists. To complete the task
with any real objectivity is impossible.The "best of" film list(s) I've never seen but would be very interesting would be thetop 10 or even 20 films of each decade. Now that's a series of best of's that at
least could approach some consensus among critics and film fans alike.

Not that it matters, but the Illumanati seem awfully biased in favor of Hitchcock, Welles, etc. How is
Psycho a better movie than Annie Hall or Manhattan or Taxi Driver?

The Scorsese of choice was Raging Bull with a strong contingent for GoodFellas and yetanother pushing for The Age Of Innocent. Hence no Taxi Driver, which I believe would beon almost everyone's list for one of the best films of the year it came out. Just because a
movie doesn't make the final list doesn't mean they don't think it's great. 100 movies is a
very small list. Try it! Clearly, this group considers HItchcock one of the all-time greats. It'swhy he and Welles and Ford among others have three or four movies on the list. WoodyAllen has fallen out of favor with the group with so many bad movies in the past 20 yearsmaking them downgrade his work in retrospect. Hannah and Purple Rose are on my shortlist.

"Goodfellas" is just brilliant. I can watch that over and over and it's as if seeing itfor the first time every time.

Some of the films on the list of 100 really don't belong there. "Written On The Wind" was pure low
rent Hollywood melodrama. "Travels With My Aunt" didn't live up to the book and Maggie Smith wasmiscast; Rosiland Russell should have played the part, and "Advise and Consent" doesn't even holdup today. Gore Vidal's "The Best Man" is much better.
12:32 PM on 03/28/2012
I agree completely on all counts, especially Travels With My Aunt, which is one of the fewmovies on the list I wouldn't even put on a best of the year list. I much prefer Anatomy Of
A Murder to Advise & Consent in the Preminger canon. I'm seeing The Best Man on
Broadway Friday night and looking forward to it. As for Douglas Sirk, he is unquestionably
a technical master; his movies are brilliantly shot and edited, with every single element(other than the acting) masterful and on a par with the greats like HItchcock. Thatpersonally can't elevate the movies past the bad acting endemic to many of them or the
silly plot twists (the funeral for a housekeeper in Imitation Of Life is as grand as a state
funeral, for example). But his stock has risen a great deal over the years and many othercritics groups. His three biggies -- Written On The Wind, All That Heaven Allows andImitation Of Life -- all received votes in the Sight & Sound poll of critics all over the world.
So the IRAs are not alone on this. But I agree with you.

So true.
I just re-watched "Advise and Consent" last week and was amused by it's naivety and lessthe good acting.
09:41 PM on 03/28/2012
Yes. It's still a good "process" movie for showing how Washington "really" worksand interesting for showing that the politicians were less concerned with details likea member being closeted than the fact that someone had broken the boys club
rules they abide by. But not a patch on Anatomy.

The Lana Turner/John Garfield version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice" should have been on
that list of 100.Others:
"To Kill A Mockingbird"
"I Want To Live""Farewell, My Concubine" (Dickensian in scope)"The Good Earth""Death In Venice""Georgy Girl""Harold Pinter's 'The Servant"

Some great movies, many of them on my personal list. More to the point, there are four I've
never seen, including The Servant, The Fixer (clearly you're a Bogarde fan), The Strange
One and Girl With Green Eyes (which I've never even heard of!). I look forward to checking
them out. How many films on the IRA list do you need to check out? In other words, how
many of them have you never seen? Unlike theater or the truly endless amount of greatnovels, thanks to DVD you can really tackle a lot of film history quite easily.

I’ve watched everything with Dirk Bogarde. He was wonderful. Check the listings
on TCM for ‘The Servant”. It’s coming up very soon. Starring Dirk Bogarde, Sarah
Miles, Wendy Craig, and James Fox, it’s a film before it’s time. Audiences weren’tready for a psychological Gay S&M relationship back then. Absolutely brilliant withstunning performances by Bogarde and Fox who is the borhter of actor EdwardFox. The film is really pent with tension from beginning to end with the master ofthe house become the servant.
Alan Bates is transfixing in “The Fixer” adapted from the book by Bernard Malmud
about the Menahem Mendel Beilis case, a case of blood libel against a jew inTsarist Russia. I didn’t read the book so don’t know if the film followed it closelybut the end was slightly disappointing and only because I found it insulting; Batesis made to appear as a Christ figure.
"The Girl With The Green Eyes" also stars Lynn Redgrave., and 'The Strange One"
ws a breakout point for Ben Gazarra in film. He's just keeps you on edgethroughout the entire film, about a military academy where Gazarra plays a bully toperfection. Made in the 50's.

Lots of Howard Hawks-very good. Not noting which of three versions of 'A Star is Born' made thelist-not so good. And unless I missed it-no Chaplin? WTF? Finally, yes: telling readers what IRAstands for would have been helpful.

<p>My bad. It's the 1954 version starring Judy Garland and James Mason. I've made the
clarification. Thanks! IRA oddly, stands for Ira, the name of one of the members. I've never
received a straight answer as to how it came to be dubbed that. They also had an ever-
changing series of names for the group, like the New York Independent Film Circle, the
New York Circle Of Very Independent Film Goers and so on. As for Chaplin, it has twosources. One, Buster Keaton has enjoyed all the revival status in the past few years, so hismovies have been showcased better in theaters (always the best place to see a film) and
therefore fresher in the mind. Second, I think slowly critics have come around to the idea --
which I support -- that Chaplin's best work can be found in his shorts. Keaton always had
the advantage that almost all attention once focused on The General. Now it's spreading
out to Sherlock Jr. and (in my opinion) The Cameraman. That's the same lack of focus thatChaplin had where some love Gold Rush, others Modern Times, still others The GreatDictator and so on. It helps to have one great classic like The Night Of The Hunter rather
than four or five great films because then no one agrees on them and suddenly Coppola is
off the list.
