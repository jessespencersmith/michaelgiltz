            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  M A R C H  2 0 ,  2 0 0 6"Thank You For Smoking" -- The PopsurfingReviewSaw Thank You For Smoking over the weekend with directorboy andrichboy. I thought it was pretty funny, if scattershot. Aaron Eckhartwas certainly well cast as a tobacco company spokesperson, reinforcinghis evil Ken doll persona. The best scenes involved him bribing theoriginal Marlboro Man who now has lung cancer and having lunch withspokespeople for liquor and guns where Eckhart mocks the lownumber of deaths caused by their products. Directorboy was annoyedby the confusing tone of the film: sometimes it was a broad satire (RobLowe in full Japanese garb) and sometimes it was vaguely earnest and"realistic" (with Eckhart dealing with his ex-wife and son). Richboysnoozed through half of it, which just about says it all. For the deadzone of March, it was fairly welcome, but I probably defended themovie more than I should have afterwards. (Adam Brody of "The OC"was of course brilliant as Rob Lowe's assistant.) ** 1/2 out of ****.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
