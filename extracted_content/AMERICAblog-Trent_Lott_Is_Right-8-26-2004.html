8/26/2004 09:49:00 AMHey, a broken clock has the correct time twice a day and Trent Lott isright about the government classifying way too many documents. Heextolls the beauty of open government in this opinion column for theNew York Times. As Lott reminds us, 9/11 chairman Thomas H. Keansaid three-quarters of the classified material he reviewed should nothave been classified in the first place.This is a decades-long trend, but Clinton put guidelines into placethat automatically declassified many documents after a certainamount of time in the belief that anything that could be made publicshould be made public. Bush has reversed that policy, seeming topractice the belief that anything that doesn't HAVE to be made publicshouldn't be made public.As Lott writes, "Secrecy has become so pervasive in the federalgovernment that it's often unclear whether facts are classified forlegitimate security reasons, or simply for the political protection ofagencies and officials.... At its extreme, the culture of classificationcan impair the information-sharing among intelligence agenciesnecessary to ensure sound policymaking; it can also deprive theAmerican people of their ability to judge the effectiveness of theirgovernment on national security matters."
