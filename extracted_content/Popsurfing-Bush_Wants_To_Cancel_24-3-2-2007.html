            <p>F R I D AY,  M A R C H  0 2 ,  2 0 0 7Bush Wants To Cancel "24"Okay, not really. But Bush's censor-happy FCC wants to seize far morepower over what's shown on the air. Several lawsuits are alreadyworking their way through the courts questioning the FCC's vague,ill-defined, and arbitrary fines for language and other "obscene" acts onTV. But before those are dealt with, the FCC says violence on TV is sodangerous it needs the power to ban it to the 10 p.m. hour.Now FOX doesn't even AIR programming at 10 p.m., so that means"24," surely the most violent show on a major network, would have noplace to go. Why does Bush hate "24?" As a conservative, I think thegov't should butt out of areas it doesn't need to be involved in and thatcertainly includes television. PBS should not be afraid that anintelligent, thoughtful, multi-part documentary on World War II couldput their stations out of business because of a few salty words spokenby soldiers when discussing the horrors they faced in fighting forfreedom. But that's exactly what's happening.Yes, when there were only three networks on the air a certain amountof oversight on the public airwaves was appropriate. But no more.There are hundreds of channels. People can watch family programmingor religious programming or music or violence or sexy programmingany time they want, day or night. Would I want my 10 year old kid towatch "24?" Absolutely not. Does that mean the gov't should banish"24" to the 10 p.m. timeslot? No. It means parents can and should beresponsible for what their children watch.Your standards of what's acceptable are certainly not the same as mineor the person next door. And it's never been easier for you to blockcertain channels and find quality programming that fits your needs.Heck, you can always turn off the TV and make your kid read a book.Just a thought. But the last thing we need is the FCC to hold unduesway over what you can watch in your home. Remember, in a year anda half, it might be Hillary Clinton's appointees deciding what's good foryou.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 1:43 PM
