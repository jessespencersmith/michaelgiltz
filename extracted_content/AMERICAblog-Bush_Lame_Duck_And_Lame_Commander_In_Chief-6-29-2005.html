6/29/2005 07:00:00 PMWhy are Bush's numbers falling? Why do the American peoplegrow increasingly concerned about Iraq?It isn't about people who supported the war but now have theirdoubts. It isn't about people who never supported the war andhave seen their fears realized. It isn't about people whoweren't sure about the war and still don't know what theythink. It isn't about the people who get confused every timeBush's rationalization for why we invaded Iraq changes.Ultimately, it's about George Bush.The American people have lost confidence in George Bush asour Commander in Chief. The American people are reluctant toadmit it, but they realize George Bush is a weak military leader.Last night, Bush had a chance to restore our confidence. Hefailed. Bush gave the same tired speech he's been giving forthe past few years. His idea of confronting cold, hard facts is tosay that war is "tough" and "hard," as if this were news to theAmerican people. Bush could have acknowledged mistakes, buthe is incapable of that. Bush might have given a realisticpicture of where we stand in Iraq and offered concreteproposals for making it better, but he only offered blithe happytalk that everything is great and we're going to prevail.A real military leader faces the facts on the ground. Problemsarise -- they always do -- and have to be dealt with. A realleader recognizes problems, attacks them and solves them. ButBush refuses to acknowledge any problems.For example, the training of Iraqis to take over their ownsecurity -- the single most important task in that country -- isproceeding at a punishingly slow rate. Bush threw out thenumber of 160,000 troops and then casually mentioned theyfall into three categories: trained and ready to fight on theirown, trained and capable of fighting with our help and notready to fight at all.How many of those Iraqis are trained and ready to fight ontheir own? Half? A third? A tenth? After the speech, we're toldthe truth. According to Sen. Joe Biden, only 2,500are fullytrained -- less than two percent. How many can fight withour help? About 8,900. In total, only about 8 percent can fightin any way. Of that 160,000 number he threw out, almost150,000 are not trained in any meaningful way. Bushrefuses to say what's going wrong, how he'll speed up thetraining or explain why he is refusing the offers of Germanyand Italy and others to train soldiers in their own countries. Butlet's say he doubles the rate of training to 2,500 a year. Heck,let's say he quadruples the rate of training to 5,000 a year.How long will it take for Bush to actually reach the level of160,000 troops he implies we have today? More than threedecades.Bush insists that the second the generals say they need moresoldiers in Iraq, he'll send them. But then he turns around and
