THE COMIC MUSE
By Paula Byrne$16.99, HarperPerennialJane Austen looms larger and larger in the popular imagination with every passing year. And
thanks to innovative adaptations by Bedlam Theatre Company and others, her work is flourishingon the stage like never before. With a musical adaptation of Pride and Prejudice  debuting this
summer, what better time to take stock? Author Paula Byrne charts the impressive track record</p>
<p>of Austen on stage, TV, and film, ranging everywhere from Colin Firth’s iconic work in the TV
miniseries Pride & Prejudice  to varied stage works and even films inspired by Austen, such as
the brilliant teen comedy Clueless . If you’ve already read Austen’s novels several times over,
give yourself a break and dip into this.
THE UNDERGROUND RIVER
By Martha Conway$26.99, TouchstoneAward-winning author Martha Conway’s latest historical novel is set on the Ohio River in the
early 1800s. May Bedloe is a seamstress for her cousin, the well-known actress Comfort Vertue,and thus just a step away from the glamour of fame on a showboat. They’re separated by fateand May must make her own way, which involves an even more ragtag group of performers …and an active role helping “ranaways” via the Underground Railroad. Suddenly, May’s life andthe lives of others depend on her acting innocent enough to fool agents of the Confederacy, butshe’s better at stitching up garments than stitching up lies.
SHAKESPEARE’S EAR
By Tim Rayborn$21.99, Skyhorse Publishing</p>
<p>A miscellany for theater lovers, this compendium by the author of Beethoven’s Skull does for the
stage what he did previously for classical music. Surely you can guess the identity of “a 16century playwright who lives a double life as a spy and perishes horribly, stabbed above theeye.” But did you ever spot the earring in Shakespeare’s famed portrait and do you know itsconnection to pirates and bohemians? Can you name the Greek dramatist felled by a fallingtortoise? Perfect for dipping into during intermission.
TEN DEAD COMEDIANS

novelist with this wicked send-up of stand-up comedians and Agatha Christie. Taking a cuefrom … And Then There Were None,  Van Lente has a mysterious but legendary funnyman
named Dustin Walker summon a bunch of comics to his island retreat. The gang includeseveryone from a late-night talk show host to a washed-up Vegas comic to an improv instructorand a hugely successful blue-collar comic. In a high-wire act, Van Lente manages to deliciouslyskewer both classic mysteries and comedy by delivering humorous monologues for eachcharacter while knocking them off one by one.th</p>

A TWENTY MINUTE SILENCE FOLLOWED BY APPLAUSE
By Shawn Wen$15.95, Sarabande BooksAppreciation of Marcel MarceauPerhaps only a radio producer would be able to do something as quixotic as write a book about
a mime. Yes, this intriguing biographical appreciation is devoted to the most famous one of all,</p>
<p>Marcel Marceau. Wen — whose work has been heard on This American Life  — begins simply by
describing Marceau on stage, alone, in the spotlight. Then Wen adds more and more
information, drawing on research and interviews and reviews to nail down in words the ineffablebeauty of mime as practiced by its greatest talent. You’ll read it in silence and then want toapplaud Wen … and then head right to YouTube to see Marceau in action. Sure, you could dothat now, but Wen’s work allows you to appreciate it like never before.
AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS
By Bonnie Pipkin$17.99, Flatiron BooksAny teens who read that Harry Potter  play should be well-prepared for this formally daring
young adult novel. It features the usual high drama, including a teen pregnancy, a boyfriend
who dumps our heroine (named Genesis, which can’t be easy), and refuge in the undergroundtheater scene of New York City. Here’s the kicker: Gen reenacts and rethinks her relationshipwith said former boyfriend via an imaginary four-act play that pops up throughout this novel. It’sclever, arresting, and a good glimpse into how your writer friends see everything as grist fortheir material, whether it’s a telenovela, a play, or a song. Be forewarned.
GOETHE: LIFE AS A WORK OF ART
By Rüdiger Safranski</p>
<p>$35, Liveright
A major new biography. Few artists have ever enjoyed the adulation during their lifetime as
Goethe did. That fame has only grown, thanks to his impact on literature, poetry, politics, thenatural sciences, and, of course, drama, with works such as Faust . Here, German writer
Safranski captures Goethe in his polyamorous approach to the intellectual life and sets himwithin the canvas of his time.
THE LIFE SHE WAS GIVEN
By Ellen Marie Wiseman$15, KensingtonWiseman’s new novel features a lonely girl named Lily, hidden away from the world in 1931
small-town America. Her wealthy parents are aghast at Lily’s appearance; the child can’t evenattend the circus when it comes to town. But she can be sold  to the circus, and thus begins this
romance about life under the Big Top, all sorts of families (especially the ones you choose), andeven romance, perhaps, even for a girl like Lily.
THE GIRL IN THE SHOW
By Anna Fields</p>
<p>$26.99, Arcade Publishing
Showbiz ain’t easy for anyone, but it’s even harder on women and even harder on women who
are funny. Lucille Ball once said, “I’m not funny at all; what I am is brave,” by which she meant,in part, she was brave to look foolish and silly on camera. In fact, it does take bravery to step upto the mic of a comedy club, step in front of a camera and mug for laughs, or step onto a stage.This cultural history of women in showbiz focuses on “three generations of comedy, culture, andfeminism” because, yes, women are funny and the fact that they have to say so proves feminismis still needed. It leans more on artists like Tina Fey and Ball, but groundbreakers as long ago asFanny Brice and Mae West found more freedom in the old days on stage just as female artiststoday get more room to grow in the rough and tumble world of improv rather than in movies,where they’re always asked to be the Wife or the Girlfriend and stand to one side and lookhelpless. Look funny? You got it. Helpless? No thanks.
THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT PLAYS 2015–2016
Edited by William W. Demastes and John Patrick Bray$19.99, Applause Theatre and Cinema BooksApplause’s annual collection of the best short plays produced around the country is essential for
anyone wanting to spot the future superstars of theater. Everyone from Tennessee Williams toNeil LaBute has made their published debut thanks to this series, and it shows no signs oflagging now.
QUEEN OF BEBOP: THE MUSICAL LIFES OF SARAH VAUGHAN
By Elaine M. Hayes</p>
<p>$27.99, Ecco
Vocalist Sarah Vaughan — nicknamed “Sassy” — was once just a singer. But then rock ’n’ roll
came along and a great divide opened up; suddenly, people like Vaughan were jazz singers,people like Doris Day were for old folks, and the kids only listened to artists who wrote their ownmaterial. But Vaughan and others like her proved the keepers of the flame for the GreatAmerican Songbook, the treasure trove of tunes written by the likes of the Gershwins and ColePorter and Irving Berlin. Or as we call it, musical theater! Vaughan was a trailblazer, one of theearly pioneers who helped desegregate radio (yes, radio had to be desegregated), all whileswinging the songs that made their debut on Broadway in shows that came and went but willnever be forgotten. This biography gives Vaughan her due in a way the stage never can. Peoplehave tried to create a stage musical around her life but who the heck can sing like Sassy?
MORALITY PLAY
By Barry Unsworth$16.95, AnchorThis is a welcome paperback reissue of a classic novel by the late Barry Unsworth. A medieval
troupe travels the countryside enacting a morality play, ritualized entertainment for the massesthat was barely good enough to get them some coins. They stumble into a village with newmember Nicholas Barber, a runaway scholar-priest. When their tired show falls flat, they comeup with the unique idea of reenacting the murder of a local boy. Unfortunately, doing so</p>
<p>uncovers inconsistencies in the story of who did it, and the actors find themselves trying to solve
a crime and stay alive when all they really want is to get paid and get out of town. A clever
melding of historical fiction and mystery combined with a fascinating look at traveling theatercompanies of the Middle Ages.
