Tear  It  Up  on  Broadway
THE  RASCALS:  ONCE  UPON  A  DREAM  *** out of ****
RICHARD  RODGERS  THEATRE
If you want to hear the difference between nostalgia and celebration, the difference
between a tribute to rock and roll and real  rock and roll, see The Rascals on Broadway.
You can hear nostalgia in shows good ( Jersey  Boys ), not so good ( Rock  Of  Ages ) and new
(Motown:  The  Musical,  which I haven't seen yet). But for the genuine article, The Rascals
are your only option.
It all happens courtesy of Steven Van Zandt. A lifelong fan of the band, Steven coerced
them into finally regrouping a few years ago for a benefit concert after decades apart. Thatwasn't enough for Steven so he put together this show, worked out the kinks upstate andbrought it to Broadway. Steven wrote the book himself and produces and directs withMarc Brickman (who also does the terrific visuals).
The set-up sounds pretty nutty: you get the band onstage, of course. But you also get
video clips of the band discussing their birth and career, clips of actor friends of Stevenplaying managers and the like, archival footage and -- strangest of all -- actors playingyounger version of the four original Rascals in the studio and getting heartfelt about why
they broke up. Whenever the band builds up a head of steam with three or four songs, the
lights dim and they segue into another clip just when you're thinking, "Keep playing!"
Often, the audience is still applauding the song they just heard, drowning out the first
words of the next segment. Does anyone care? No, they do not.
It helps that The Rascals are in top form musically and can turn up the energy level on a
dime. Eventually, you give in to the scrapbook, genial, have a drink and share a storynature of the evening. And the great songs keep coming, some 28 in all (and that doesn'teven include my favorite from their debut album, the sexiest version of "Mustang Sally"ever). Along with a great cover -- their first #1 hit "Good Lovin'" -- the songs are mostly bylead singer and keyboardist extraordinaire Felix Cavaliere and lead singer and tambourineman Eddie Brigati. If you know who wrote what, well you know more than me andprobably understand better what tore them apart all too soon back in 1970 (or 1972,depending on how you parse it). Suffice to say, despite their brilliance the band memberswhich also include guitarist Gene Cornish and drummer Dino Danelli were never remotelyas successful on their own.

<p>In two hours, Steven fits in a lot of story amidst the stream of hit songs. Though always
known as Jersey boys, they also have upstate New York roots. They were sparked by thesuccess of Eddie's older brother David (who sat a row in front of me and cheered them onall night). He had hits as a member of Joey Dee and the Starliters, proving yet again thatguys from their neighborhood could hit the big time. Their journeys take the guys invarious directions first, from backing up a singer in Vegas while wearing kilts (don't ask)to jazz clubs in Manhattan to finding and sticking with each other and snagging that big
break: a gig as a house band in the Hamptons. The Hamptons? Yes, Felix understood that
the Hamptons was the one place every record executive headed to on weekends and in the
summer. Sure enough, they became the hottest band in town, people crammed the club to
hear them, they turned down Phil Spector (!) because they wanted to produce themselves
and Atlantic finally gave them the freedom to do so.
There's more, such as Eddie's near-fatal car crash (he couldn't remember his name but put
him up on stage and he could remember the songs), their growth from a tremendous bar
band with deep roots in soul to a rock band that embraced everything from psychedelicato pop to protest music, their instinctive embrace of civil rights and finally the internal
politics that drove them apart.
Forty years later they're finally back and performing together. Brickman's visual displays
in the background are a great boon. He gives each song a new setting, switching from
paisley playfulness to film clips to visual references (like the train that would careen by
one of their early clubs) to full-on trippiness. It might have easily seemed cliched butBrickman knows what he's doing and the visuals let you focus on the music rather thanthe age of the band, which ranges from 67 to 70, along with three backup singers and twoother musicians.
And the music sounded great. I saw the show on its first night and Eddie's mic cut out
right at the start of the show opener "It's Wonderful." That was soon fixed but the audiomix was far from ideal, with the vocals brought in way too low. I assume that was tweakedby night two, which would already bump the show up a notch in my rating. At first, timeseemed to have weighed on Eddie's vocals the most. Felix however was sharp right fromthe start. But two or three songs in, Eddie warmed up and was right there, providing greatbackup, chiming in on choruses and delivering his big numbers like the brilliant "HowCan I Be Sure" with passion. Felix gave as good, knocking out "Groovin'" and "GoodLovin'" and their first hit "I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore" and "I've BeenLonely Too Long" with conviction.
Whatever fences were mended, every one of the band members surely wanted to prove
this wasn't old home week and they could still deliver. Felix and Eddie wereunquestionably spurring each other on. Their songwriting collaborations were key but theband's unique chemistry made them truly special. As they say in the show, Felix felt soulmusic in his bones and had the vocals to prove it. Eddie had a terrific voice and a passionfor doo wop. Gene was crazy about Duane Eddy and rockabilly. And Dino (the band's bestinstrumentalist and on anyone's short list of "greatest drummers of all time") was steepedin New Orleans jazz and second-lining flair. Put them together and you have a band thatcan deliver everything from the subtle pop of "Groovin'" to titanic soul classics to theprotest anthem "People Got To Be Free" (a song that was released in the sadly appropriatesummer of '68 when unrest and violence was in the air).
It was strangely poignant to see actors expressing their disappointment over breaking up</p>
<p>and how it happened when the real men were right there and probably never could share
their feelings with such directness to each other. You could only smile when the real Eddie
silhouetted onstage raised his arms to shrug as if to say "Yep, I was a schmuck" when his
video alter ego left the band. The three others paid due homage to Felix and his artistic
ambition that pushed the band to greater heights (he clearly saw himself as the Brian
Wilson of the group). But this show was the final proof that together they were far greater
than the sum of their parts. Felix and Eddie were ideal co-vocalists since their strengths
were so complementary. Gene seemed the peacemaker of the band and was hugging and
embracing everyone in sight when not reveling in his guitar lines. And Dino may have
been sporting a kerchief and a white shirt that made him look like a sous-chef but he was
tossing off riffs and keeping the beat with such a mighty, thunderous aplomb that it was
breathtaking to behold.
And the songs! Eddie sang some rocker I didn't even recognize but he killed it. Felix
sounded like the years had fallen away on "A Beautiful Morning" and a personal highlight
was "A Girl Like You," the song that for me typified their evolution from a tremendous
bar band to a tremendous studio band. It was a love-fest for the crowd. The man next to
me exclaimed, "I grew up with them!" before bear-hugging David Brigati. It may have
been a rambling valentine but the sentiment was real. They sounded so good together youcouldn't help wishing to see them in concert again -- no stories, no videos, no frills, justthe band doing hit after hit and letting the music build and build. Preferably in a smallclub. Even if you don't get that chance, the real accomplishment of The  Rascals:  OnceUpon  A  Dream  is that it's not just a look back but very much in the moment. You don't
have to wonder what they might have sounded like; you can say you saw them and theysounded pretty damn great.
Those who can't make it to their Broadway stand should check out their music. The band's
first and third albums ( The  Young  Rascals  and Groovin ') are their best. But their most
popular release was Time  Peace:  The  Rascals'  Greatest  Hits,  one of those terrific
collections that serves a band well and is the perfect introduction to their music. It cameout on CD in 1990 and a remastering is long overdue. Look for it and you'll find two CDanthologies and multi-CD boxed sets. But those encyclopedic collections are for thealready won over. If you're not Neil Young and still buying everything on vinyl, you're bestoff buying a digital copy of Time  Peace  and tossing in the later single "People Got To Be
Free." That will give you 15 of their best songs, from killer covers like "Mustang Sally" and"Midnight Hour" to all the hits. Play it over and over and you'll soon be a fan and knowexactly why people are still talking about The Rascals 40 years later.
