zThompson's "l,lanny" diaries
Nanny McPhee
**
Universal, $29.98
FARbe it fromme to
criticize the delightfu.l Emma
Thompson. But despite
wickedly ugly makeup and a
serious overbite, her Nmy
Iacks the bite of Mary Poppins.
Blame the frantic direction of
Kirk fones. It all goes dom
easi.ly, tharks to Thompson,
Colin Firth md not-too-cute
child actors. Modest extru do
not include comentary from
Thompson, who wote the
screenplay
The NewWorld
***%
New Line. $27.98
NO director can rival
Tenence Malick for the sense
ofwonder he creates
omcreeL It's here in spades,
from the mival of sNos in
America to Pocahontds'
captivating joumey to
Englmd. There's a substmtial
making-of documentary, but
all we get is the revised 135-
minute vereion - the original
that won awrds was longer,
md Malick was also working
on a three-hour cut.
Sgt Bilko:50th
Anniversary Edition
****
ParamounL S39.95
Tlls first and best con
artist, Sgt. Bilko (created by
Phil Silvers), has virtually
disappeued from view. But
these 18 episodes prove that
"M*A*S*H" uasn't the first (or
even perhaps the best)
comedy to use the Army as a
pmching bag. Loads of extras
include audio comrnentary,
appearalces by Silvers with
Ed Sullivm md Dick Cavett,
Emmy clips and much more.
The Towering
Inferno: Special
Edition***
Fox. $19.98
THE remake "Poseidon' has
prompted re-releases of 1972's
"The Pose idon Adventure:
Specid Edition" (Fo& $19.98);
1974's "Eathquake"
(Universal, $14.98) md
another fave flick, I974's "The
Towering Inferno." Sue it's
silly. And crzy, stupid, str-
studded fiD Extras include 30
deleted scenes md a new
docmentary but sadly no
word from O j Sirnpson, r'ho
