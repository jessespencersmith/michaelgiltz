            <p>New documentary hunts for 0sama, sort of
ocumentary maker Morgan Spurlock chowed down on McDonald's
hamburgers for "Supersize Me," his hilariously gross expos6 of fast-food
chains, and turned to cable TV for his regular FX series'30 Days" (which
begins its third season June 3). Now with "Where in the World ls Osama
Bin Laden?" opening Friday, Spurlock uses his amiable, regular-guy perspective to
take a look at the most wanted man in the world.
Nominally done to make the world safer for the unborn child his wife, Alex,
was carrying, the film has Spurlock traveling to hot zones throughout the region
- Afghanistan, Egypt, lsrael and Saudi Arabia - talking to people about their lives,
their hopes for the future, what they think of America and, oh, yeah, do they know
where Osama Bin Laden is?

There was a kid who saw the film who was
about L9 or 20 years old, who came up to me and
said, "l've been thinking about going overseasand traveling abroad, and now after seeing
this movie, I'm going to get a passport as soon
as I get home." For me, if it makes somebody
say, "l'm going to go find out for myself and
see whafs out there," great.
