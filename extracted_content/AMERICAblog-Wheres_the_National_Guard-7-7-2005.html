7/07/2005 01:13:00 PMGod forbid there should be an attack on one of our cities sayvia chemical weapons. But it's something we need to beprepared for. A key part of those plans: the National Guard andArmy Reserve. And where is the National Guard and ArmyReserve? Iraq. Don't you feel safer?What is the availability of troops from the National Guard andArmy Reserve here in the US? How does that troop strengthhere at home compare to their levels in 2000? How thinlyspread out are they? If there was a security need in LosAngeles, what troops are close enough to respond within 24hours or whatever the essential time frame may be? Whatabout Chicago? What about Seattle? What does that diminishedability mean for our national security? What could we do safely5 years ago that we can't do today because those troops aren'tavailable -- they're overseas? What is the retention rate for theNational Guard and Army Reserve today compared to five yearsago?Reagan once asked, "Are you better off now than you were fouryears ago?" Here's my question, "Do you feel safer now thanyou did four years ago?"
