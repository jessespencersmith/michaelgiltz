9/24/2005 11:44:00 AMMore proof that the beating and torture of prisoners held bythe US was routine, widespread and condoned from above.Three former members of the Army's 82nd AirborneDivision say soldiers in their battalion in Iraq routinely beatand abused prisoners in 2003 and 2004 to help gatherintelligence on the insurgency and to amusethemselves....The abuses reportedly took place between September2003 and April 2004, before and during theinvestigations into the notorious misconduct at theAbu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. Senior Pentagonofficials initially sought to characterize the scandal there asthe work of a rogue group of military police soldiers on theprison's night shift. Since then, the Army has opened morethan 400 inquiries into detainee abuse in Iraq andAfghanistan, and punished 230 enlisted soldiers andofficers.Shameful. Thanks, President Bush for subverting everything Americarepresented to the world.
