4/13/2005 01:31:00 AMIn an unseemly rush, the Vatican leaders are claiming they feelan upsurge of support to name the barely deceased John PaulII a saint. (Claims of miracles -- two are needed beforesomeone can become a saint -- have already started floodingin.) According to the New York Times, some of this is political(trying to push cardinals into supporting a really conservativecandidate by showing how much people loved JP II); some isjust the rush of emotion after the outpouring of affection forthe Pontiff. It's all dubious Catholicism (at best), sincesainthood is traditionally a slow and careful process thattypically doesn't even begin for five years after someone diesand usually takes AT LEAST decades if not centuries beforewinding up. He would be only the fourth Pope in the last 900years to be named a saint.However, it would be appropriate in some ways for John PaulII, who turned the Vatican into a Saints R Us factory. JPIIchurned out almost 500 saints -- more than all hispredecessors of the past 2000 years COMBINED. After thatrush to judgment, sainthood has been so devalued that itwouldn't seem so extraordinary to pass the honor on to him soquickly.
