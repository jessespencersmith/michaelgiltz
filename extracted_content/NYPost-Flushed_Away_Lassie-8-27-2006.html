(f) If the little ones start begging for a pet rat this 
Christmas, blame Sam Fell. The British animation 
filmmaker oame up with the Idea for -and co-di­
rected, with David Bowers -the Aardtnan Anima-
tion company's "Flushed Away" (Nov. 3), which this 
fall Is part of a kid-movie crowd that Includes 
"Everyone's He,o~ (Sept. i5), "Open Sea­
son" (Sept. 29), the 3-D reissue of "Tim 
Burton's The Nightmare Before Christ­
mas" (Oct. 20) and the holiday season's 
"Charlotte's Web." 
Aardman, the studio behind Wal­
lace & Gromit, recruited an all-star 
cast of voices (including Hugh 
Jackman, Kate Winslet and Ian 
McKellen) for its tale of a well­
heeled English rat who sinks 
low, only to find high adven­
ture. But to hear Fell tell it, . 
the whole thing may have 
been just an excuse to get sub; 
terranean and see the real London 
underground. 
·We got to go down into the sewers, • 
Fell says happily, the way one might discuss 
a trip to FIji. ·We all had oxygen and spe­
cial suits and big gloves. It was all very dan-
gerousl" 
For Charles Sturridge, the director of 
"Lassie" (Sept. 1), tl'le danger was in work­
ing with real animals. The gentle, England-set remake of the classic tale faces off against other 
live-action family fare like the junior secret agent 
flick "Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker" (Oct. 6), • 
"F1lcka" (Oct. 20), Tim Allen's "The Santa Clause 3: • 
The Escape Clause" (Nov. 3) and the holidayfanta-
sy tale "£ragon." 
#It's hard to describe what working wit;! animals 
is like," muses Sturridge, who has helmed critically 
acclaimed TV epics like "Brideshead Revisited" and 
"Gulliver's Travels." "It's not like you think, 'I've done : 
five days and the next five will be okay.' It's, 'My God, • 
I've survived five days of this. How will I do six?' " •
