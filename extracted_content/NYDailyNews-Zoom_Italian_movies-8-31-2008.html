be lovers pretend to be ltalian in orderto
woo one another. Hollywood does the same
with audiences: whenever it needs someone
warmhearted, loud and willing to make hand
gestures at the drop of a hat, it turns to an
Italian character - though not always an
Italian actor. Here are some of Hollywood's
most lovable ltalians and whether they're
distinctive or just stereotypes.
MOONSTRUCKOgET)
tlqv thds ltafnn: Loretta (Cher, in her
Oscar-winning role) is a widow who wants a
nice, safe, quiet marriage ... until she meets her
fiance's moody, passionate, frustrating younger
brother (a never-better Nicolas Cage).
Befiembifity: When Cage says, "l love you,"
Cher slaps him and says, *Snap out of it!" Stereo-
type? You bet - and all the more hilarious for it.
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER 0977'
llow thafs ltalan: Always grittier than
you remember, this look at Tony Manero (a
magnetic John Travolta) can't get enough of his
swagger, his strut and his carefully coiffed hair.
Betembf,tf Tony is as self-satisfied as
a peacock, and it's awfully appealing. lt's awall and can barely contain his discomfort and
prejudice over his mostly black clientele.
BefrsabiEtf Aiello isn't lovable, but Lee
doesn't make him a monster, either. He's a
genuine, flawed human being. Aiello is allowed
to reveal the frightened, uncertain human
behind a bigoted, stereotyped front.

tlw th#s ltaEan: Dennis Christopher had
the role of a lifetime playing Dave Stollel a
small-town kid obsessed with cycling long
before Lance Armstrong made it cool.
fefen|liftf Dave eats ltalian food, rides an
Italian bike and says, "Buongiomo, papa!" (Dad,
the grumpy Paul Dooley, snaps, "l'm not'papa!'")
And he's not even ltalian - he just wants to be.quite easily.
