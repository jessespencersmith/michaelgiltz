10/04/2004 02:20:00 AMTerrifically encouraging NYT article about the payoff in all those drivesto get new voters to register. Record numbers are eligible to vote inswing states and most of the success is coming from non-partisanand Democrat groups."Registration numbers are impossible to tally nationwide," says theNYT, "and how many of the newly registered will vote is a matter ofsome debate. But it is clear the pace is particularly high in urbanareas of swing states, where independent Democratic groups andcommunity organizations have been running a huge voter registrationcampaign for just over a year."
