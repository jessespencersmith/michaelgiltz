            <p>T H U R S D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 8 ,  2 0 0 7Should Muslims Object To "24?"Not at all. Muslims are upset that in two out of the last three seasonsMuslims have been involved in terrorist cells. As FOX point out to USAToday:"Over the past several seasons, the villains have includedshadowy Anglo businessmen, Baltic Europeans, Germans,Russians, Islamic fundamentalists, and even the (Anglo-American) president of the United States," the network said."The show has made a concerted effort to show ethnic, religiousand political groups as multidimensional, and political issuesare debated from multiple viewpoints."In the first four episodes, we've seen FBI agents sidestep the law inorder to harass and profile a Muslim group. This was portrayed asbeing objectionable and unconstitutional to at least some people on theshow, including the President's sister. Nonetheless, we see the Muslimhead of the group be understanding of the pressures the gov't faces andwanting to cooperate before he is arrested and thrown into a holdingcell. This treatment is ALSO seen as unconstitutional and wrong anddebated vociferously at the highest levels of gov't. Despite this, whenthis American Muslim overhears what he believes to be crucialinformation, he immediately arranges to get the info out to the FBI saythey can act immediately. Then he insists on going back into holding sohe can spy some more, risking his life in order to hopefully prevent aterrorist attack. Jack himself is teamed with a Muslim who hasrenounced terrorism and wants to encourage a peace process. There ismuch more on every issue, but in short we see good and bad Muslimsof every stripe, just like we have with every other group. Complaining isjust not smart. Instead they should recognize this is a show and pushthe positive portrayals as something to celebrate -- when was the lasttime American TV depicted an American Muslim in a positive light?Use this opportunity to educate instead of just wishing "24" would goaway. It isn't.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 5:09 PM
