GOOD PEOPLE  ** out of ****
Manhattan Theatre Club at Samuel J. Friedman Theatre
Playwright David Lindsay-Abaire tackles the haves and
the have-nots in his unfortunately thin followup to thePulitzer Prize-winning dram Rabbit Hole. Who are thegood people in this story? You can't help rooting forMargaret (Frances McDormand, in fine form). She's a
single mom in the poor neighborhood of South Boston with a special needs kid, struggling to get by whenshe's fired from the Dollar Store for being perpetually late. And why is she late? Because she can't afforddecent daycare and has to wait for her landlady to show up before Margaret can take off for her low-
paying job. It's the latest in a string of jobs she's held down.
In one of the show's more effective moments, Margaret details the tenuous hold she has on surviving by
showing how taking a bite of some hard candy leads to a chipped tooth which leads to a dentistappointment (delayed for six months until she can't bear it any longer -- by then of course, it's infected

<p>and more expensive to fix) which leads to a late car payment which leads to no car which leads to being
late to work which leads to another job down the tube.
Is Stevie good people? Played by Patrick Carroll, he's a morose sort of guy who manages the Dollar Store.He tells Margaret he has to fire her or he'll be fired himself (she's had eight warnings about hertardiness). But Margaret thinks that's b.s.
What about her landlady, played with vigor by Estelle Parsons? Dottie might be eying Margaret's
apartment as a crash pad for her ne'er do well son and she's always late for babysitting. But Dottie
charges $50 a week -- which isn't exactly high -- and taking care of a special needs kid isn't exactly apiece of cake. Margaret goes along with Dottie's defense of her behavior, but maybe she can't afford tooffend the only person who will watch her kid for such a low price.
Then there's Mike (Tate Donovan). Mike and Margaret dated briefly in high school, but he got up and out
of the South Boston neighborhood through hard work, smarts and the advantage of a dad who pushedhim to succeed. He likes boasting about his tough childhood but certainly doesn't hang around with the
old gang anymore. A fertility doctor, Mike has a nice office in a nice neighborhood. Out of desperation,
Margaret pushes her way into his workplace and asks for a job.
That's the set-up for Good People.  Rather predictably, every character is seen in one light and then in
another -- Margaret works hard, but she might be racist. Mike has a black wife, but has a shameful past.
Stevie fires Margaret, but keeps trying to help her out. And so on. The first act has some plot -- Margaretgets fired and then bullies Mike into inviting her to his birthday party so she can try and cadge a job fromone of his friends. But the action is so minor, the conflict so minimal, you don't really feel like the playhas even begun.
Act two has a little more zip. It's mostly set in Mike's home. When he calls Margaret to say the party has
been canceled, she thinks he's lying and shows up anyway, setting off a showdown of sorts between Mike,his wife Kate (a solid Renee Elise Goldsberry) and Margaret. Lindsay-Abaire is too much of a pro not toland some punches here, including some funny lines about Kate being mistaken for a nanny and Mike'sDominican secretary. But it all boils down rather simplistically to the rich being indifferent or callous andthe poor being noble and kind. The gray areas it serves up simply aren't that convincing. Margaret ispushy, but she's got a kid to feed. Mike does volunteer work (or at least donates money and sits onboards), but he cheats on his wife and was a punk growing up.
Still, it's hard to buy Margaret completely. She's blunt or rather pushy -- the sort of person who insults
you, takes a little dig and then says "I'm just busting your balls," as if that makes it alright. She wants to
be the one who let Mike escape the neighborhood by breaking up with him and at the same time thelong-suffering martyr who pays the price for his indifference. McDormand creates sympathy for hersimply by the dint of her forceful, winning personality. But Tate Donovan's Mike simply isn't complicatedor interesting enough to serve as a foil. No matter what we learn about him, the play isn't about Mike andso we just don't care that much.

<p>Daniel Sullivan pumps what life he can into the second act and the sets by John Lee Beatty are typically
cleverly done, convincing and to the point. The play ends with Magaret at bingo, holding a marker overher cards and dispiritedly looking for the lucky break that never comes. Life isn't easy for a lot of people,certainly not for Margaret. That doesn't make her good or bad and unfortunately here it doesn't makeher very interesting either.
TIMON OF ATHENS  *** out of ****
The PublicThe Public Theatre  is world famous for its free performances of Shakespeare in the Park. But it also has
one of the best bargains in the city for theater you pay for: the Public Lab  offers shows at $15 a pop. You
might expect glorified workshops or middling offerings by minor talents. But time and again it's proven a
good launching pad for new works and a chance for serious artists to explore less commercial fare. Casein point: Timon of Athens.
When the economy collapsed, the Public decided to mount two Shakespeare plays that revolve around
money. The Merchant Of Venice  received a glorious revival that transferred to Broadway. Timon of
Athens  is a much more problematic play. But Richard Thomas of The Waltons  and director Barry
Edelstein wanted to tackle it.
Judicious pruning of the text hasn't turned Timon  into a great play. But it has enabled them to deliver a
good one, focused with laser precision on debt. Timon can be seen as a bit of a fool, too profligate by far
with his money and soaking up praise by hangers-on. If you bring a bottle of wine to his house for dinner,he'll send you home with a barrel. Or two. Admire his spurs and he'll insist you take his entire ridingoutfit.
But with Thomas and his inherent decency shining through in the role, Timon is shown in a more
positive light. He's a friendly, generous man who is foolish with cash but only because he wants to see thebest in others. When his debts mount up and he turns to his friends for help, Timon is truly disappointedthey don't come through.
Similarly, a righteous Reg. E. Cathey is an Athenian captain who has served his country bravely. It isclearly in his debt. When he asks for mercy from the Senators of Athens for a soldier (the minor salve ofbanishing the man for life rather than killing him) and is rudely denied, Cathey is also shocked. Have hisgood deeds earned him nothing?
With this focus, the play has rarely made more sense, from Timon's behavior in the beginning (usually
just annoying since the men around him are such sycophants) to his disdain for the gold that falls into hislap towards the end. Thomas is stronger in the first half when he's dispensing treasure and waiting forhis kindness to be returned. But he smartly leavens the tragedy of Timon's situation in the second halfwith humor and self-awareness.

<p>Theater doesn't need elaborate sets for a thoughtful, clever production, as Edelstein and his creative team
show. The pace of the first act is bracing, with one scene tumbling upon another. The costumes are amodern mix that get across status without bothering with period exactness. Curtis Moore's vivid andelectric guitar-heavy score (played with aplomb by Simon Kafka) adds to the sense of excitement.
And the cast is solid from top to bottom. For a long time, American performances of Shakespeare
featured one or two leads who handled the lines with ease and the rest lagging far behind. The gap
between US and British actors when it came to the Bard was substantial. No more. Here the Public offers
up strong players throughout, led by Thomas and Cathey through the sycophants like Greg McFaddenand Anthony Manna to the cynical truth-teller of Max Casella down to the handsome Joe Paulik handlingseveral small roles with ease.
So catch this Timon  if you can by March 6. And be certain to keep an eye out for future Public Lab
offerings  from the world premiere of Urge For Going  starting March 25 and the New York premiere of
Knickerbocker  in May.
THE NIGHTINGALE AND OTHER SHORT FABLES  *** out of ****
BAM Opera House
Director Robert Lepage is one of the most acclaimed, distinctive directors working in theater and opera
and film for decades. Yet somehow I've managed to miss his work completely, much as it has intrigued
me from afar. So it was satisfying to finally see him in action with this sweet evening of puppetry and
music performed by the Canadian Opera Company at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The set is lovely: two open-air pavilions on each side of the stage with a pool of water connecting them.
The left side is empty while the right features a tree-like large branch jutting up out of the ground. Watermust be one of the most effective elements to use in a show because it always enchants. Here the ripplingof the water is reflected on the walls and right up to the ceiling of the Opera House, creating a dream-likeeffect from the start.
The first act is composed of short musical pieces composed by Igor Stravinsky, as well as the brief fable
The Fox: Farmyard Burlesque. Puppetry of various sorts is at the heart of this show. Early tunes areillustrated with shadow puppetry performed by artists on the left pavilion. A ripple of pleasure sweptthrough the crowd when they displayed their craft, so simple and yet beguiling. The singing was fine ifnot perhaps as robust as one might like for peasant tunes. But Teiya Kasahara was notably moving on thehaunting Two Poems by Konstantin Balmont and Meredith Arwady was strong on her solo "Berceuses duchat." Musically, Todd Palmer was flawless on his clarinet solos.
The Fox fable was told with a combination of singers and gymnastic tumbling behind a screen where
their bodies created more shadow puppetry.
But it was The Nightingale that dominates the evening and your memory. The rest was prelude. Theentire second act was taken up with the tale of a fisherman who heard the sweet singing of a nightingale

<p>so lovely that word of its beauty reached the Emperor of China. He had the nightingale brought to court
and was so entranced by its singing he offered the bird all sorts of titles when all it really wanted was theappreciation he offered. Then emissaries from Japan arrived with a mechanical nightingale. Peeved atthis affront to his dignity, the nightingale took off for the forest. Not to be outdone in peevishness, theEmperor said the nightingale couldn't take off because he'd been banished from court forever.Nonetheless, when the Emperor lay dying, the nightingale returned to bewitch Death and earn the ruler a
reprieve. This time, the nightingale promises to sing for the Emperor every night.
It's a curious tale. Why exactly does the nightingale return, you wonder? But it has intrigued artists for
centuries. Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater have been developing a musical version of it as their follow-upto Spring Awakening.
Here, Lapage uses the music of Stravinsky to embrace a positively charming production filled with
puppetry. They range in size from a tiny boat and fisherman that traverse the canal that links the two
pavilions to a giant skeletal Death that would fit right in on a Day Of the Dead parade. The tiny, delicate
puppets are paired off with performers who both manipulate the puppets and sing the roles. The
puppetry is a wonderful way to create an aura of wonder. Combine it with the music of Stravinsky and
suddenly even the simply motion of the tree branch swinging out over the canal feels like a bit of magic.
The singing again is solid if unremarkable. It's the puppetry that remains front and center. Happily, there
is one major exception: Olga Peretyatko as the Nightingale triumphs in the lead role. She subtlymanifests the prideful arrogance of the bird, whether it's the playful impatience she shows when waitingfor people to stop talking so she can sing or the immediate distrust the mechanical nightingale awakensin her ego. Peretyatko gives the story emotional heft, an intelligent throughline and glorious singing thatturns the simple story from a delight (thanks to the deft puppetry) into a more moving experience.
This all-too-brief run has been a hot ticket since it was announced. Rush to BAM by Sunday if you can or
just wise up and subscribe to their seasons.
BEAUTIFUL BURNOUT  ** out of ****
St. Ann's Warehouse
The Frantic Assembly/National Theatre of Scotland scored a major triumph when it came to St. Ann's
with Black Watch . They've just announced the show is returning (with a new cast) in April for a three
week run. If you missed it, don't hesitate or it might sell out again.
But that hit wasn't all the NTS scored: they also came up with their new show Beautiful Burnout.  A visit
to where the cast was dressing and showering exposed co-director Steven Hoggett to Gleason's Gym and
the beauty and power of boxing. (Co-director and choreographer Scott Graham had been a lifelong fan.)Since movement and physicality is always central to Frantic Assembly's work, boxing was both a naturaland a huge challenge: now audiences wouldn't just comment on their work artistically. The people whomattered most -- real boxers and boxing fans -- might just dismiss it as "wrong" if they didn't capturesomething essential and true about the sport while fielding a cast that could be convincing.
After a long gestation period and a lot of sparring, they've delivered this mood piece. It combines the
music of Underworld with a modest, overly familiar storyline. Bobby (Ewan Stewart) runs a gym forserious boxers. He's been cultivating a couple of lads (and one lass) for a while: the "brown lad" AjayChopra (Taqi Nazeer), who is the most promising and the usual assortment of boastful kids, what passesfor intellectual among athletes, and a girl (Vicki Manderson) who demands respect even though herboxing is fueled as much by rage as by a love of the sweet science.
The usual dramatics ensue: Bobby demands total and blind obedience while Ajay is a little ahead of
himself and has his own ideas about the best way to box and become famous. Turning pro is a tantalizingprospect that keeps them going until Ajay and Bobby butt heads once to often and Ajay leaves. Inevitably,a showdown will occur between Bobby's chosen one and Ajay.</p>
<p>This presents the show as much more plot-driven than it really is. The storyline is just a wisp of a thing,
an excuse really to choreograph moments on stage. The play is set on a large boxing ring, with a rotatingoval in the middle. Some vivid moments occur when the music explodes and the cast is onstage bobbingand weaving in unison, skipping rope, doing push-ups and the like. Sad to say, it's not terribly
interesting. Beautiful Burnout  doesn't have enough story to support the melodramatic twists in the last
few minutes (none of which feel earned) and not enough sheer beauty in the spectacle to take your mindoff the cliched plot. The cast is fine, especially given their sketchy roles and they certainly work their asses
off to perform the show.
It comes together once or twice. First, Eddie Kay (who also plays the boxer Neil Neill) shines as the
referee, sliding around the stage at the beginning as he explains in poetic form the role he plays in thesport. The final match is staged nicely, with the referee and the girl sporting the round card criss-crossingthe stage during the bout.
But it's the sparring match Bobby holds to decide who will face Ajay that fully captures what Frantic
Assembly was going for. For the first time, the oval on stage begins to rotate. The boxers attack eachother and then one boxer suddenly freezes as he makes contact while the other one steps away, agonizesover their mistake or rethinks a move and then steps back into place just as they both begin to fightagain. It's a wonderfully theatrical way of breaking down a boxing match, capturing both the agony ofthose split-second moments and the beauty of the action.
They could have gone even further -- using this technique in other scenes to let the coach describe what
they did wrong and how to counter it, for example, while the other player is frozen in time or just to getmore fully into a boxer's head. We could have learned about the strategy and chess-like moves in boxingalong with the boxer and thus come to appreciate the game even more. It would have tied in nicely with
the opening monologue by the referee, which pointed the way towards a show that could have
illuminated the game nicely in a fresh, theatrical way. Instead we have a show that's not gritty enough forfans and not poetic enough for those who aren't fans and not insightful enough to create any new ones.
