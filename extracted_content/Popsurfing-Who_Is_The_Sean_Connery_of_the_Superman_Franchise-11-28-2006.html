            <p>T U E S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 8 ,  2 0 0 6Who Is The Sean Connery of the SupermanFranchise?In his weekly DVD column, Dave Kehr of the NYTimes has a nicewriteup on Louise Brooks in "Pandora's Box." Then he tackles the waveof Superman releases with this off-hand comment: "...the 1950stelevision series starring George Reeves (still the Sean Connery goldstandard in the role)...." George Reeves the definitive Superman? Kehrmust be showing his age. I'm assuming he was a kid when the TV showexploded into popularity; what other explanation can he give fortouting Reeves over Christopher Reeve? The TV show was kiddie stuffand while Reeves acquitted himself well, his performance isn't a patchon the first two great Superman films of Reeve who managed to makeSuperman sexy and funny and real without undermining his essentialBoy Scout nature. It's not easy to give up on an early definitiveperformance of an icon. But Basil Rathbone now takes a back seat toJeremy Brett and George Reeves simply doesn't leap tall buildings withthe same aplomb as Christopher Reeve.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Hmm, is that the Superman you grew up with? Maybe we all getwedded to our first Superman -- can I say that outside ofMassachusetts? I do think Cain was charming too in the role though Ican't help feeling he and Routh built on what Christopher Reeveaccomplished, variations on a theme sort of. Tom Welling I thinkdelivered on a fresh approach, thanks to focusing on a fresh area ofSupe's life -- though the show was never worthy of him.10:47 PM
