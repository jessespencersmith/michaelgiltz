10/15/2004 03:30:00 AMThey're probably annoyed it's coming out, but Bush officials wouldlove to reward Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez with a fourth star, saysthe LA Times. Sanchez was in charge during the Abu Ghraib scandal-- not to mention when insurgents seized control of a number of Iraqicities. Amazing. According to a classified report about the scandal (forwhich only low-level soldiers are paying a price)"The general personally approved some of the controversialinterrogation tactics that have been criticized as abusive to prisoners,according to classified portions of a recent report to Congress byArmy Maj. Gen. George R. Fay, obtained by The Times. A year ago,Sanchez changed the interrogation policy three times in less than 30days, confusing interrogators as to what was permissible, Fay wrote.Fay said Sanchez adapted interrogation rules from those atGuantanamo where, unlike in Iraq, the administration did not grantdetainees the rights of prisoners of war under the GenevaConvention."Sanchez "authorized the use of techniques that were contrary toboth U.S. military manuals and international law," Leahy said in anOct. 1 statement. "Given this incredible overstepping of bounds, Ifind it incredible that the reports generated thus far have notrecommended punishment of any kind for high-level officials.""Among those determined to get Sanchez that fourth star? Our buddyRumsfeld. Of course, they'll wait till after the election since they knowthose bleeding heart liberals would make a fuss. Talk about noaccountability.
