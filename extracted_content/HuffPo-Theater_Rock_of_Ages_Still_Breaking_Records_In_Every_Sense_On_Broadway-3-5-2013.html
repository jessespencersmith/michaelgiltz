ROCK OF AGES
HELEN HAYES THEATRE
The musical Rock of Ages  is chugging along in
Broadway's smallest house (the Helen Hayes
Theatre, which seats just under 600 and isnicknamed the Little Theater) but it's become
one of the biggest hits in history.
The records keep falling: the show just broke
onto the list of the 50 longest running shows in
Broadway history,  passing Jekyll & Hyde  to do
so. It's one of five jukebox musicals in the Top
50, including Mamma Mia  (the music of
ABBA), Jersey Boys  (Frankie Valli and the
Four Seasons), Smokey Joe's Cafe(composers Leiber and Stoller) and Ain'tMisbehavin'  (Fats Waller). It's also one of
seven shows on that list that are still running on Broadway (led by 25 years andrunning megahit The Phantom of the Opera ). On April 7, it reaches its fourth
anniversary since the show opened. (It began previews on March 22, 2009.) It hasalso productions touring the country and with sit-downs in Las Vegas and London(which recently switched to a smaller house, just like the Broadway Rock of Ageswisely did two years into its run).
Here's video of opening night, when everyone was thrilled to be on Broadway (after
starting at a tiny club on the Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles in 2005 and opening
Off Broadway in 2008).
They surely never imagined the show would still be selling out about 90 percent of its
seats four years later and if you asked them why it worked so well, the only honestanswer is "Who knows!" A recent visit to the show found it in typical form for a long-running hit -- perhaps a little flabby (just like many audience members, includingmyself) but clearly offering what people expect: a cascade of '80s pop-rock hits(heavy emphasis on hair metal bands like Whitesnake and Poison) and a boy-meets-girl storyline just cause you have to have a story as an excuse for the songs, dude!
The theater that night was apparently sold out almost entirely to employees of aMay 6, 2014

<p>company taking its team on a junket so they were even more rambunctious than
usual, especially after the show worked in a quick joking reference to the company's
business. (Pool supplies, if I'm not mistaken.)
You can't help pondering what elements of "the best night on Broadway" -- as their
ads cannily tout this crowd-pleaser -- have helped it hit such rarified heights. Most
people would begin with the roster of familiar hits that fill the show -- songs like NightRanger's "Sister Christian" and Pat Benatar's "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" and
Europe's "The Final Countdown." Amusingly, "Cum On Feel The Noize" is here and
Americans will think of Quiet Riot while in London they surely recall the originalsmash hit by Slade. But lots of jukebox musicals have famous catalogs but close
quickly. If all you needed were familiar songs, this spring's Motown The Musical  will
run for 20 years.
But my first choice for the most essential elements of the show are the scantily clad
women. The female chorus and lots of the actresses are dressed in sexy, cuteclothes, whether waitressing at the Bourbon Room where our hero is hoping tobecome a famous rock star (after he finishes cleaning out the bathrooms and takingout the garbage) or at the strip club where they head when acting doesn't quite panout. Broadway caters heavily to women (they make up 60 percent of theatergoers in atypical season) so shows like Jersey Boys  and this that can appeal to men without
alienating women are manna from heaven. You can just see the guys in the audiencewatching the girls in their naughty outfits dancing and singing "I Hate Myself ForLoving You" and thinking to themselves, this Broadway isn't so bad.
Then you have the songs, shoehorned in this way and that, with only a word or
phrase needed as an excuse to tie a song into a scene. The crowd favorite wasunquestionably Poison's #1 hit "Every Rose Has Its Thorn," which had the entire
audience singing along. (This isn't a show where you have to remain quiet. Air
guitaring is encouraged.)
Then there's the gay subplot, which reminds the audience, hey this is a Broadway
show after all. It's a bait and switch, actually. The son of a German developer whowants to tear down the Bourbon Room for a strip mall seems gay and proudlydisplays more spandex than Olivia Newton-John in the "Let's Get Physical" video. Heseems like jokey gay comic relief until the lad insists, "No, I'm not gay. I'm justGerman!"
It turns out the real gay subplot involves the two regular, middle aged guys who run
the bar. They finally declare their love for each other by singing REO Speedwagon's"Can't Fight This Feeling" to raucous applause and laughter at the performance Iattended. (The laughter is over silly choreography the cast indulges in.) It's a cannychoice of song. Something like an Air Supply tune might have been too much likemocking them; but a cooler song might have spoiled some memories. Even in thepantheon of 80s pop-rock hits, REO Speedwagon falls comfortably in the anonymousmiddle -- catchy enough to be recognized but not "important" enough to ruffle any
feathers.
But I think one key element seems almost like a throw-away at the very end. The
show finale (before they all sing Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'") involves a run-downof what happens to the various characters. Their fate -- almost always happy -- isrevealed along with the comforting aside that "they're still rocking!" And whathappened to our hero with dreams of being a rock star and his girlfriend Sherrie whodreamed of being an actress? Their dreams of fame didn't come true. Turns out theylive in suburbia and have a kid. But the show quickly reassures us that sometimes thedreams you arrive with aren't the dreams you leave with and, hey, they're still rocking!
So a show about rock stars and wannabes ultimately celebrates making a regular life
for yourself and not getting all worked up over what might have been or never couldbe. It's a comforting message for people who may have been in a band in high schoolor performed in a play or two in college and wondered "what if." And even if you neverdreamt of fame, you can at least sing along to all the hits.
Still, my two favorite moments came out in the lobby. Right before the end of act one,
that's where I spotted one of the staff members by the bar (surely an aspiring actor)singing along and recreating the moves on stage that were happening right at thatmoment. Then heading downstairs to the restroom I saw walls lined with rock photosand posters...and in pride of place, a large oil painting of Helen Hayes, the first lady of
the American theater. Draped over one corner of the frame? A pink bra.
