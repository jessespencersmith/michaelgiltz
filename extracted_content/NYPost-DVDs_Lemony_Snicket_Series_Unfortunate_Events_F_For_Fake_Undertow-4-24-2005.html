N Lemony Snicket's 
A Series Of 
Unfortunate Events **'/2 
DreamWorks, $38.99 
This adaptation of the 
wickedly amusing chil­
dren's books got everything 
right except the story. The 
casting is great (especially 
a hammy Jim Carrey), the 
sets are eye-popping and the 
tone of pleasant maHce is dead 
on. But squeezing in plots 
from the first three books 
was a big mistake: We 
don't know any of the 
characters well enough 
to care when they're 
D!.~' killed off. Very amus­
"'for Fake *** Criterion, $39.95 
Give Orson Welles a movie 
Camera and he could play for­
ever. He may not make a film 
in any traditional sense, but he 
will have fun. You can, too, 
with this indulgent treatise on 
forgeries from 1976. The mar­
velous extras include an 88 
minute film on his unfinished 
projects that represent cine­
ma's most tantalizing tease. ing extras include 
commentary, deleted 
scenes, a making-of 
documentary and 
more. 
Undertow 
*** MGM,$26.98 
This gothic children's story 
- a bad guy invades the 
home; orphaned kids go on the 
road in search of treasure -is 
the latest intriguing film by 
director David Gordon Green. 
It's elevated by Josh Lucas 
(who looks like Matthew 
McConaughey) and Jamie Bell. 
The best extra is a commen­
tary by Green and Bell.</p>
