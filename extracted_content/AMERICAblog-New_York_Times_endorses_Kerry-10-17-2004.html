10/17/2004 01:15:00 AMYes, but their thoughtful editorial both praises Kerry and effectivelydamns Bush with a catalog of ills. I would have been proud to write itmyself. They remind us Bush came in with a promise - indeed a need-- to lead from the center since his presidency began "nearly fouryears ago, after the Supreme Court awarded him the presidency," asthey so cuttingly put it."The president who lost the popular vote got a real mandate on Sept.11, 2001. With the grieving country united behind him, Mr. Bush hadan unparalleled opportunity to ask for almost any shared sacrifice.The only limit was his imagination."He asked for another tax cut and the war against Iraq."It's well worth reading in full and sending to any undecideds(whoever they might be).
