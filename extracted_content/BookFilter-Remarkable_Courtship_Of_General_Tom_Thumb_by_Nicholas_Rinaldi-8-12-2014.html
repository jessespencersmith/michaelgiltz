Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayOddly, Tom Thumb simply doesn't come across as that interesting in this novel based on the life of the diminutiveentertainer. Made famous by P.T. Barnum, "General" Tom Thumb became a worldwide sensation, traveling theglobe, meeting heads of state and generating intense interest wherever he went. Barnum suspiciously hires a femalelittle person but Thumb can't help himself -- he falls in love with her and they marry in one of the most media-drivenevents of its day (think Tiny Tim getting hitched on "The Tonight Show" or more like Charles and Diana forcomparison sake). His life and story are inherently compelling and the backdrop of the Civil War provides drama. ButRinaldi's story never quite comes across as specifically about Tom Thumb. It might be to a story's credit that weforget who we're talking about and their unusual height, but surely it would inform Thumb and his every day dealingswith the world in ways large and small that would make his perspective and take on the world truly unique? But timeand again throughout this picaresque tale, Thumb merely registers as one more person and not a terribly interestingor insightful one. HIs life was too rich to keep this novel from being actually dull, but Rinaldi never quite brings him tolife and the background -- Lincoln, Walt Whitman, the war, Queen Victoria -- remains far more vividly etched in yourmind. Poor Tom Thumb is overshadowed in his own tale. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
