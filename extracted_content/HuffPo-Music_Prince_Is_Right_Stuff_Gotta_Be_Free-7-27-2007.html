I just got an offer in the mail to buy a year's worth of Entertainment Weekly . As a former "EW"
subscriber, I'm apparently entitled to the "alumni rate." (Have I missed the annual gatherings, the
newsletter?) Instead of paying $171.50 for the full cover price of 57 issues, instead of paying thestandard subscriber rate (whatever that may be), I'm being offered a full annual subscription ... for$10.
Ten dollars? That's less than 18 cents an issue-- even with bulk rates, will that even cover thecost of mailing it? In short, EntertainmentWeekly  is practically giving itself away for free.
How soon will it be before they offer to sendme the magazine for nothing?
Prince is right, apparently. He gave away  his new CD to readers of the UK paper the Daily Mail.
Not for free, really -- the paper is paying Prince a chunk of change. But it works out great: thepaper gets a ton of publicity, their readers get a free CD, Prince gets a guaranteed amount ofmoney and reaches fans who might never have bought one of his CDs. That can only encouragethem to buy a ticket to one of his shows, and buy a t-shirt or other merchandise, the areas whereartists have made most of their profits for years.
So it's worth more to Entertainment Weekly  to practically pay me to take their magazine. They get
to announce a higher circulation and more eyeballs mean higher rates for their ads. Of course a lot
of those ads are from Time Warner, the company that owns "EW." When they want to promotetheir movies or TV shows or CDs in their own magazine, they naturally like to have as many peoplereading it as possible.
You can already read lots of Entertainment Weekly  content for free on their steadily improving
website , just like you can read much of the New York Times  and countless other publications. If
they're giving it away online, why not give away the print edition too? For years, newspaper
subscriptions have mostly just paid for the cost of delivery. The real profits come from ads, notfrom forcing people to pay for a print edition of something they can get online for free.

Review Gets Him...And that's why seemingly bizarre changes like giving away Entertainment Weekly  and other major
magazines and newspapers are only a matter of time. You can get it for free -- or enough of it to
satisfy you -- online. So why pay for it? And from their point of view, why force you to pay for a
newspaper or magazine of whatever when if you read it, they'll make more money off their ads?
Twenty years from now, major magazines like Time  and Entertainment Weekly  will give
themselves away for free. People will subscribe to music databases the same way they subscribe to
cable TV. Big companies and little artists will make their money one way or another. And if you
want the new Prince CD, all you'll have to do is go online and ask. Prince knows that just means
more people will pay to go to his concerts -- one experience that can't be downloaded. Yet.
