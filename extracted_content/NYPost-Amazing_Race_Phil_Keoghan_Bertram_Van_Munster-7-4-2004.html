• REALLY BIG SHOW 
Ready, set, go -around the world in 30 days 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
WIDELY considered the'smartest, best­
produced reality show, "The Amazing 
Race" was on the verge of cancellation 
-until it beat out the heavily favored ''Ameri­
can Idol" at the Emmys last fall. Now it's 
launching a new 13-hour season, the show's 
fIfth. 
According to host Phil Keoghan, you can 
thank the Emmy for all this attention. 
"I certainly believe it was a huge factor in 
people saying, 'Hold on a minute:" says 
Keoghan, a native New Zealander. Now he says 
the "Race" team is determined to turn the cult 
hit into a mainstream phenomenon. 
This season, which kicks off at a pier in Santa 
Monica, Calif., fans can expect 11 new teams. 
They include a Christian couple who are also 
models, and -in the show's most noteworthy 
addition - a pair of cousins, one of whom is a 
little person. 
''A lot of people are asking me, 'Have you 
made changes for them?' " says series co­
creator Bertram van Munster about the 
team of Charla and Mirna. "We have not. 
Our experience has taught us that teams 
can catch up if they use their brains." 
Indeed, one of the highlights of the 90-
minute opener is watching Charla, the lit­
tle person, try to hail a cab by seeming 
helpless. The film then cuts to a pre-show 
interview where she observes that when 
people see her, they feel sorry and want to 
help. 'We're definitely going to use that," 
Charla says, like a seasoned pro. 
There are also three big innovations this sea­
son. Teams who come in next-to-Iast get all 
their traveling cash taken away. The Fast For­
wards, which allow teams to skip select legs of 
the race and proceed to the pit stop, have been 
cut way down from one per team to two per 
season. And there's now a Yield, a ploy which 
lets one team force another to stand still for a 
certain amount of time. 
"That turned out to be very, very effective," 
says van Munster. 
For Keoghan, ''Amazing Race" has proven the 
ideal job. He knew the show was working early 
in the first season when he was stopped on the 
street in New York and asked to repeat his sig-. 
nature line, "You've been eliminated from the 
race!" 
"I said the line and the guy says, 'No, no. Like 
you do on the show, with the eyebrow:" 
Keoghan says. " 'We're going to run up [again], 
and we want the eyebrow: "
