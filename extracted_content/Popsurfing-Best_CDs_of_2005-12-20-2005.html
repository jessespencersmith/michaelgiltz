            <p>T U E S D AY,  D E C E M B E R  2 0 ,  2 0 0 5The Best CDs of 2005 -- The Extended VersionBEST ALBUMS OF 20051. Richard Swift – The Richard Swift Collection, Volume One(literate pop) – in this day and age -- when every band is overhypedand "discovering" someone means watching them perform in arecurring role on a primetime series -- stumbling on a new artistunawares is almost impossible. But a tiny, one paragraph review in aBritish music magazine compelled me to buy this album by the WestCoast-based artist. Think Randy Newman (without the cynicism),Harry Nilsson (without the vocal flourishes), Van Dyke Parks (withoutthe artifice) and Tom Waits (without the gravel). A story teller and aromantic, Swift’s songs sound like they were written in a dusty hotelroom circa 1920 by a young man wearing a natty suit and composinghis lyrics on a manual typewriter. Swift's website is nifty too.2. Sufjan Stevens – Illinois (eclectic pop) – when Sufjan Stevensreleased Michigan and said he was going to release one concept albumfor every state, it sounded like a threat. Now it seems like a giddypromise. Here he uses many styles – Philip Glass, folk, rock, pop,country – to tell many stories about Illinois, whether it’s a UFOsighting, Superman or a serial killer. Bursting with ambition, itsucceeds.3. The Eels – Blinking Lights and Other Revelations (suicidal pop) –never really focused too strongly on the Eels before, but this MagneticFields-like opus makes an obsession with death and dying seemwonderfully life-affirming.4. Amadou & Mariam – Dimanche a Bamako (world pop) – a famedMali duo for decades, Amadou & Mariam were new to me. However,I’m a big fan of their producer here, Manu Chao, who brought his giddyworld pop sensibility to their music. The fusion is infectious.5. Betty LaVette – I’ve Got My Own Hell To Raise/ Various – IBelieve To My Soul (soul) – No producer had a better year than JoeHenry. He gave soul survivor LaVette the album she always deserved(“Just Say So” will break your heart) and then turned around andNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
