            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  O C TO B E R  1 2 ,  2 0 0 6Where's Your American Flag?CNN and anti-immigration specialist Lou Dobbs was on "The DailyShow" today and I was struck by the fact that he was sporting one ofthose American flag buttons that every politician wears. If you're apolitician, you literally can't even think about walking out the door inthe morning without donning an American flag. It's easy to say that'ssilly and stupid and there are other (better) ways of demonstratingpatriotism. But I doubt you could run for the House and certainly notthe Senate and never the Presidency without putting on that little flag.Hilary wears her little flag every day. To even question the wearing ofthe little flag would doom your political career. I'm worried that sooneven citizens won't be able to go outside unless they don a littleAmerican flag. People will harass you on the street: oh, you hate thiscountry? You hate the flag? And if that seems unbelievable, imagine anAmerica where we torture prisoners, illegally spy on our own citizens,and keep innnocent people locked up for years long after we realizethey're innocent because we've treated them so cruelly we're afraid torelease them. That'll never happen.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
