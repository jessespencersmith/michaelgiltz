11/03/2004 02:59:00 PMWell, yes, but a very tepid one. It's a big mandate for Republicans ingeneral -- they gained in the House and the Senate and held on tothe White House. They now dominate State legislatures, Governors,the House, the Senate, talk radio, cable news, the Supreme Courtand the White House. It was really unhealthy when the Democratsdominated everything for many years and it's going to be just as badnow that the Republicans do.But a mandate for Bush? He won the popular vote. (Hey, if at firstyou don't succeed...) But it came down to one state. One state. Ifone state had flipped, if Kerry had won Ohio OR Florida, then hewould be the President. One state is not a stirring mandate.But Dick Cheney is quoted in Bob Woodward's book as saying in 2000that the idea that they should govern from the center because they'dlost the popular vote "last about 30 seconds." They're certainly notgoing to change now.HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: Ronald Reagan beat Walter Mondale in1984, winning 58.8% of the popular vote versus Mondale's 40.4%.Now THAT'S a mandate.
