11/03/2004 02:59:00 PMWell, yes, but a very tepid one. It's a big mandate forRepublicans in general -- they gained in the House and theSenate and held on to the White House. They now dominateState legislatures, Governors, the House, the Senate, talkradio, cable news, the Supreme Court and the White House. Itwas really unhealthy when the Democrats dominatedeverything for many years and it's going to be just as bad nowthat the Republicans do.But a mandate for Bush? He won the popular vote. (Hey, if atfirst you don't succeed...) But it came down to one state. Onestate. If one state had flipped, if Kerry had won Ohio ORFlorida, then he would be the President. One state is not astirring mandate.But Dick Cheney is quoted in Bob Woodward's book as sayingin 2000 that the idea that they should govern from the centerbecause they'd lost the popular vote "last about 30 seconds."They're certainly not going to change now.HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: Ronald Reagan beat WalterMondale in 1984, winning 58.8% of the popular vote versusMondale's 40.4%. Now THAT'S a mandate.
