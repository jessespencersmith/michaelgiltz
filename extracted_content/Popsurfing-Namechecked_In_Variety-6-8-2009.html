            <p>M O N D AY,  J U N E  0 8 ,  2 0 0 9Namechecked In VarietyIf I can't write for Variety, at least I can get quoted in Variety. A newarticle in Variety about the success of Pixar's Up quotes my HuffingtonPost article, which dissed the Wall Street critics who questioned thefilm's potential and dissed the New York Times for factual errors andletting the analysts mouth patent untruths when making their case.(Not to mention ignoring how analysts have been wrong about Pixarfilms time and time again.) All good.Two minor problems. The Variety article implies that I chided analystsand the New York Times AFTER the movie Up opened to gloriousreviews and excellent box office. But I deserved a little more credit thanthat. In fact, I wrote my detailed critique six weeks ago, the very day theNew York Times article appeared. And I didn't intend to write"mockingly;" I was highlighting mistakes that should have beencorrected by the Times as well as numerous instances where theanalysts quoted were shortsighted, misleading or just plaindemonstrated a lack of knowledge about the business they're supposedto be talking about. Still, it was fun to see myself quoted in Variety, atrade paper I've been reading since I was a little kid growing up inSouth Florida.But the other problem really hurt: they spelled my name Glitz insteadof Giltz. I suppose it's my fault for not changing it to "Michael Gannon"the way I wanted to when I was twelve years old. (NOTE: And now it'sbeen corrected! Thanks Mr. Lowry.)P.S. By the way, the article gives one of the analysts (Pali Research'sRichard Greenfield) a chance to redeem himself...and he falls flat on hisface. First, rather than acknowledge that Up got off to an excellentstart, he pettily says "It's hard to call success/failure for the film afterone weekend...especially given the fact that 5% fewer people saw thefilm opening weekend than 'WALL-E."Huh. Where to begin. First, it's actually very EASY to declare somefilms a flop after their opening weekend: Land of the Lost certainlybellyflopped. Maybe it will do exponentially better overseas (where thetitle has no resonance, unlike in the US). But it's pretty easy to call it aNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
