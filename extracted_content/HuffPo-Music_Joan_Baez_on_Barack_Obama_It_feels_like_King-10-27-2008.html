 Joan Baez on Barack Obama: "It
feels like King"
Read More:  Barack Obama , Folk Musuc , Joan Baez , John

Joan Baez  has a marvelous new album out, a
quiet, wisdom-filled work called Day After
Tomorrow  produced by Steve Earle and filled
with songs by him, Elvis Costello, TomWaits/Kathleen Brennan, Thea Gilmore andothers. Tunes like the brilliant opener "God IsGod" ( you can listen to it here ), the ancient-
sounding "Rose Of Sharon" (a new tune thatsounds like some long-lost ballad from 300 yearsago) and Patty Griffin's "Mary" reveal a voice thatis older, obvously, and wiser, certainly. Whereonce that angelic soprano would ring out over a
crowd at a civil rights march led by Martin Luther King Jr., now Baez can speak quietly andconfidently, knowing we'll listen.
"Gravity has a big part to say," says Baez, in an exclusive interview with Huffington Post. "The
voice lowers and lowers. Every brilliant arrangement I worked out over the years, I can't useanymore because it's just too high to sing."

<p>Michael Giltz: Joan Baez on Barack Obama: "It feels like King"
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/joan-baez-on-obama-it-fee_b_138272.html[4/5/2009 1:13:03 PM]
Her voice may not be quite as flexible, but her way with a lyric is better than ever. Perhaps a
youthful joy in pure melody has been replaced by a greater emphasis on the words, such as the titletrack "Day After Tomorrow" where Baez sings the lines "It is so hard and it's so cold here" in sucha plain, unadorned voice she's practically speaking them. The effect is gripping.
But how could you talk to Baez -- a fighter for social justice virtually her entire life (her first act of
civil disobedience was to refuse to scurry to cover during an air raid drill at school) -- and not talkabout the election? Her last CD, a live album, was recorded in New York City's Bowery Ballroomjust days after Bush won reelection in 2004.
"Days!" says Baez, who is celebrating 50 years of performing. "I was amazed we could even work.
New York City was in a state of total depression."
The city was like a dead man walking, wasn't it?
"That's what I call McCain," she laughs. "Dead Man Walking and Shotgun Sally - what a terrific
ticket."
You won't be surprised to hear Baez has endorsed Barack Obama. But you should be. Throughout
decades of campaigning for the weak and the powerless, the poor and the lost, Baez has alwaysbeen steadfast in staying away from politicians. She's never endorsed so much as a dogcatcher,much less someone running for Congress or the Senate or the White House. But Barack Obama isdifferent.
"I am positive and hopeful," says Baez, who turns 68 on January 9, just 11 days before the next
President is inaugurated. "I've always shunned party politics, for good reason. Obama just
overwhelmed me really -- knowing that once he's in office he'll probably do things I hate." She
laughs. "But the things that appeal to me and young people and poor people and black people -- it's
undeniable. It feels like King. I'm sad in a way that he didn't stay outside of the system because I
feel like he could have spearheaded a real movement. I don't know how much he can do in that
office."
What about Sarah Palin? When she was announced and most people didn't know her or her
record, did Baez think, even for a moment, "Hmm, a woman. That's interesting."
"No," says Baez. "I took one look at her and I thought, 'Jesus Christ. What has happened?' She
looks like a retired pom-pom girl."
Is it a safe bet Baez didn't get along with the cheerleaders in high school?
"You know what, I tried out to be a cheerleader," she confesses. "Me and my friend Bunny, we had
a wonderful [cheer] worked out, but we were Mexicans. They were absolutely not interested in how
clever we were. [As for Palin,] I thought it was panic. Are they stupid enough to keep it up? And to
the credit of the American people, her rising star is starting to dip below the horizon at least a little
bit."
But what is it about Obama that convinced Baez to endorse a politician for the first time in her
life?
"The level of intelligence," she explains. "The reintroduction of the word compassion. The concept
of sacrifice. The interest in literally reaching out to countries -  like Spain," she laughs, then adding
seriously, "Any guy running for President who has a picture of Mahatma Gandhi up in his office isgoing to intrigue me."
"The only way I can really make sense of it is King because my politics have always been at the

Rocket Launchbase of the pyramid. This is the first time I've been willing to extend or stretch my stuffy beliefs to
the top of the pyramid. With King, it was so active. We were shoving that pyramid around from its
base. That's what I'm comfortable with. The higher up that pyramid you go, the more dastardly
things you're going to be requested to do."
On Tuesday, October 28, Baez begins a US tour at Town Hall  in New York City (the first of two
nights). She's sure to sing a healthy chunk of her new album and draw upon the wealth of classic
tunes she's sung and made famous over the years. She's performed in New York many times. Butshe's never sung at an inauguration. If Obama is elected and she could perform at it, what songwould she sing?
"'Swing Low' or 'Amazing Grace,'" says Baez. "Whatever will just add to the joy and excitement that
everyone -- in my camp anyway -- is experiencing. A song like 'Amazing Grace' brings out theabsolute, utmost good in just about anybody. It's a song that people sing on. It's a song that peopleare moved by and they have been for my entire 50 year career. It can be an homage, easily."
And hopefully one of the songs on her new album would fit right in by proving prophetic. On Thea
Gilmore's "The Lower Road," Baez sings "Because for every midnight hour, there's always a rising
sun."
"Isn't that lovely?" says Baez.

I've been an Obama supporter since the day he announced his bid for the Democratic nomination 18months ago. But for me, one of the greatest days of this long, arduous campaign season----after theeuphoria of the Iowa caucuses and just a few days before the tense results of 'Super Tuesday'----wasthe day Joan offered her endorsement of Senator Obama.
As a fan and follower of all things Baez over the past 38 years, I was aware that with all the work she's
done on behalf of the poor, vulnerable and oppressed, both here and around the world, she'd never
before supported a political candidate for office. 
It was like a bolt out of the blue, and a reassurance that what I had seen and sensed in Barack Obama
was something truly special. Thank you, Joan, for everything you've done throughout your life, and forthe inspiration, joy and entertainment you still provide with your words, your wisdom and your music!

I too was shocked when Queen Joan endorsed him, but quite pleased. Baez should have a
regular column on HP. In Europe she's treated like a godess in the US like a traitor/wierdorelic.
