From the Publisher: From the author of the acclaimed Crooked Heart
comes another “smart, funny, ingenious, revealing tale of London lifeduring the Second World War” ( The Independent )—longlisted for the
Orange Prize upon its original publication in England. It is 1940. France
has fallen, and only a narrow strip of sea lies between Great Britain and
invasion. The war could go either way and everyone must do their bit.Young copy writer Catrin Cole is drafted into the Ministry of Information tohelp “write women” into propaganda films—something that the men
aren’t very good at. She is quickly seconded to the Ministry’s latest
endeavor: a heart-warming tale of bravery and rescue at Dunkirk. It’s allcompletely fabricated, of course, but what does that matter when thenation’s morale is at stake? Since call-up has stripped the industry of itsbrightest and best, it is…

What We Say
What a treat! This story is set in London during WW II, with a young woman leaping from the Ministry of Information and
boring old patriotic shorts to an unexpected opportunity working on a feature film about Dunkirk. The government wantsmore female heroines featured in war movies to boost morale, so this movie focuses on two young women who took part in
that famed naval rescue. Our heroine Catrin Cole is expected to deliver the mushy, feminine dialogue beneath the dignity of
the men delivering the script. Vain actors, cynical writers, dodgy politicians and bombs falling all around? Wonderful! Whileauthor Lissa Evans delivers all the fun one might expect, at every step of the way she deepens and complicates the tale.Share This Book

<p>Instead of types we have individuals and instead of comic whimsy we have a story with the weight and pleasure of real life.
Catrin is a plucky delight, but she's matched every step of the way by a wonderful cast -- from a dresser at Madame
Tussaud's to a doughy character actress to a shambling theatrical agent, they are all complex and surprising. No wonder it's
been made into a film starring Gemma Arterton and Bill Nighy, due out in April. Even if it's good, you'll undoubtedly besaying "The book was better." Trust me. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“The period details evoking London during the Blitz are masterfully done.” - Library Journal
“This is a comic novel, but far warmer in tone and broader in scope than that label would suggest....Gloriously
observed...Hilliard is a wonderful creation—and Evans’s recreated propaganda scripts are a total joy. Delicious.”
- Times  (London)
“I try not to say, ‘If there’s one novel you should read this summer..’ but Crooked Heart  tempts me to say it.” -
Scott Simon, NPR, on Crooked Heart
“Glorious. I loved every line of this book.” - Paula Hawkins, author of The Girl on the Train , on Crooked
Heart
“In ‘Crooked Heart,’ Lissa Evans’s absorbing and atmospheric comic novel, another quietly heroic orphan joins
the canon….This is a wonderfully old-fashioned Dickensian novel, with satisfying plot twists….Both darkly funny
and deeply touching….It’s a crooked journey, straight to the heart.” - New York Times Book Review  on
Crooked Heart
“Beautifully written, minutely observed and researched, evocative and very funny tale.” - Guardian  (London)
