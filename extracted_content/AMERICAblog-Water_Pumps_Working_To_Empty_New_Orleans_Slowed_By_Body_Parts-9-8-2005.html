9/08/2005 08:12:00 PMIn a gruesome detail that reminds us of the terrible humantragedy we're dealing with, USA Today reports -- in an item onpage A5 which I can't find online -- that water pumps are beingslowed because the pumping stations themselves have to bepumped out. Furthermore:Officials are also being slowed in some locations because offear that human remains could be mixed in with thedebris, clogging pumps.Horrifying and sad. And some of them didn't have to die.
