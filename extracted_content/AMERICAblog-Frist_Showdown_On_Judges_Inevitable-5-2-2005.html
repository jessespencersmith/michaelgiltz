5/02/2005 02:14:00 AMFrist talks to USA Today and says a showdown on the fillibusteris all but inevitable. Of course, because unless the Senateapproves absolutely every single nominee Bush ever presents,then it's being absurdly obstructionist.He's also surprised anyone would characterize his meeting in achurch with far-right evangelical leaders who condemnDemocrats as godless sinners who hate Jesus for not approvingextremist judges as anything other than reasonable and fair.Frist can't imagine the Dems "acting that radically" by shuttingdown the government. You mean, as radically as theRepublicans under Newt when they did the same thing?Finally, Frist admits he has more work to do in keepingRepublicans in line. As for the Presidency, gosh, he doesn'tknow if he'll run yet but boy saving lives as a heart and lungtransplant surgeon is just as appealing. No, Frist, run forPresident! We need you to pull the Republican who will actuallywin his party's nomination over to the extreme right.
