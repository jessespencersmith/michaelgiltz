 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyCannes 2011 Day Six: Malick's Latest
Opus, A Dour Dumont andAustralia's Most Infamous SerialKiller
World class directors like Lars Von Trier, Aki
Kaurismaki and Pedro Almodovar are still to come. So itdoesn't seem quite fair but the most anticipated movieof the Cannes Film Festival finally debuted. TerrenceMalick's The Tree Of Life  provoked at least one singular
act: all five of the people in my rental apartment got up
and out the door at the same time, which has never
happened in the history of my attending the festival. Weall bolted out the door at 7:15 and were in line at theLumiere before 7:30, with only a dozen people in frontof us, waiting to be let in a full hour before the moviewas set to begin. We wanted to take no chances, getgood seats and not face the tension of a crowd surgingtowards the guards at 8:10 or so. No croissant or coffee
at the corner boulangerie, no trade newspapers from the Majestic Hotel, just a straight line for thecinema.
One tradition of the fest is that someone will shout out "Raul!" right as a screening begins. It began one

<p>year when the pickings of the first few days were especially grim and disappointing. Critics faced an
overload of movies that should never have been made, much less accepted for screening at Cannes andfrankly they were losing heart. As people settled in for a movie directed by Raul Ruis, someone called outalmost plaintively, "Raul!" as in "Raul, please  save us and deliver a good film!" (I'd like to think the year
was 1999 when he delivered Time Regained  but I can't swear to it.) Waves of laughter greeted this
spontaneous prayer and "Raul!" soon became an enduring catchphrase. Annoyed by the hypesurrounding Malick (people who merely saw the trailer began insisting The Tree of Life  would be his
masterpicece), my friends had a more belligerent air. Whaddaya got, they were saying. And finally,
succinctly, one said quietly to us as the lights went down, "Bring it, b***h!" Well, Malick did.
THE TREE OF LIFE  **** out of ****
It's brilliant. Let's get that out of the way. If you like director Terrence Malick, rest assured his new film
fits in snugly alongside B adlands, Days Of Heaven, The Thin Red Line  and The New World.  It features
extensive voice-overs musing on the nature of life, stunning images that convey a wealth of emotion and
a surprisingly detailed storyline conveyed almost entirely without conventional narrative. If you're not a
fan, this certainly won't win you over. But if you've never seen a Malick film in the movie theater, this
look at growing up in Waco, Texas in the 1950s may be the perfect entry point when it opens on May 27.
That's not to say the movie isn't polarizing. It looks certain to be the most hotly debated film of the
festival. No film buff can afford to miss it, and I can't wait to see it again. To read the full review, go here.
HORS SATAN/OUTSIDE SATAN  ** out of ****
Writer-director Bruno Dumont's latest film is a typically flat, affectless work in which you spend much of
the film puzzling out exactly who is who and what is going on. Nonetheless, I found it a tad more plot-driven than most of his films and thus more engaging. Plus, I'm a sucker for itinerant preachers and thelike. The Guy (David Dewaele) is certainly saintly, quietly dropping to his knees in prayer at the drop of a
hat. He lives outdoors in a rural area of France, depending on The Girl (Alexandra Lamatre) for food and
friendship, though he's not one much for talking. When he takes a shotgun and kills her stepfather, wequickly realize she was being sexually molested. Even her mother begs the Girl for forgiveness since shedidn't step in and put a stop to it. Things get more puzzling when a local woman begs The Guy to see hercatatonic daughter whom the doctors can't help. Turns out he's a Sin Eater of some sort, sucking out thegirl's demons and taking the burden upon himself. This almost makes Hors Satan  an action film by the
standard of Dumont's movies. Things get terribly murky in the third act when Dumont loses the threadof his story completely. Everything we think we know about the Guy, the Girl and his special talents isconfounded in an uninteresting and messy manner. Still, the two leads are strong, the visuals typicallystriking and for a while at least the plot was unexpectedly penetrable.
SNOWTOWN  ** out of ****
Many people had a problem with the film Michael , which meticulously showed a pedophile on his daily
routine while a boy is trapped in his basement. What's the point, they said? I felt the aesthetic of the film,
the terrific performances and an uneasy fascination with the process -- seeing exactly how this mild-

<p>mannered creep gets away with it -- kept me engaged. All those people can make the same complaint in
spades with this Australian film about the worst serial killer in that country's history. Here's hoping theclearly talented director Justin Kurzel can more fully illuminate whatever story captures his attentionnext time around. Snowtown  is grim, grim, grim and easily holds the record for most walkouts at a
movie so far this festival. That's what happens when you blithely shoot a dog and soon are torturing,
beheading and otherwise killing people. The one sympathetic character in this nightmare is poor Jamie.
This kid from a broken home is preyed upon by the pedophile next door who takes nude pictures of him
and his brothers, raped by Troy and then has the bad luck to get befriended by John Bunting, a man who
seems obsessed with perverts. (Jamie is played by Lucas Pittaway and John by Daniel Henshall -- both
are very good and the central real reason to see the film.) John begins by harassing the pedophile untilthe guy moves away but soon escalates to beheading junkies, torturing and killing others and turning onanyone who might spill the beans. It's a relentlessly dour experience, I must say. The good performancesand solid tech work all around can't turn it into an edifying one. What's the point?
