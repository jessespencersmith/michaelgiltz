And nobody thought he knewPhilby like Nicholas Elliott, Philby’s best friend and fellow officer inMI6. The two men had gone to the same schools, belonged to thesame exclusive clubs, grown close through the crucible of wartimeintelligence work and long nights of drink and revelry. It wasmadness for one to think the other might be a communist spy, benton subverting Western values and the power of the free world. But Philby was secretly betraying his friend.

Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis is a corker. The British are obsessed -- and rightly so -- with the Cambridge Spy Ring. Why would men ofprivilege, the bluest of bloods, betray their country and spy for the Soviet Union? I first became intrigued by this truetale of espionage and betrayal thanks to the fictional treatment it was given in the play and film "Another Country."That led me to read some classic books on the subject. Now Ben Macintyre has made this oft-told tale seem freshand riveting all over again. He focuses on Kim Philby, the greatest and most damaging spy in this scandal. Mcintyreapproaches Philby's tale from a new angle as the story of friends. Philby completely hoodwinked his fellow MI6officer Nicholas Elliott (his best friend) and the legendary James Jesus Angleton of the CIA. These two men simplycould not imagine "one of them" -- much less their closest friend, Kim -- being a turncoat. Friendship and connections, the old boy network, the nod of approval from senior officials who knew Philby's father and saw the young man as"one of us" was his way into MI6. Friendship was his way up the ladder. Friendship was what protected him long afterit should have been obvious or at least suspected a LOT more that he was betraying everyone. Mcintyre delves intojust how devastating Kim Philby's betrayal was, making this story riveting indeed. He also does a convincing job ontwo disputed issues. The way Mcintyre makes his case, there is virtually no question that both Eliott and Angletonwere duped right up the very end, despite their desire to retroactively insist they had been suspicious for years. Also,there's little doubt they practically begged Philby to escape to the Soviet Union, letting him slip out of their handsrather than go through the embarrassment and public nightmare of a trial. As an afterword, novelist John Le Carreshares notes of his conversations with Philby after the man's betrayal was known that bring Philby's deeply blinkeredattitude (why shouldn't he and Elliott still be friends?) to life with intriguing verve. Despite knowing how it all ended, Iwas hooked. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayNew York Times BestsellerNew York Times Book Review Notable BookAn Amazon Best Book of the YearWashington Post Notable BookEntertainment Weekly's Best Spy Book of 2014“Macintyre has produced more than just a spy story. He has written a narrative about that most complex of topics,friendship...When devouring this thriller, I had to keep reminding myself it was not a novel. It reads like a story byGraham Greene, Ian Fleming, or John Le Carré, leavened with a dollop of P.G. Wodehouse...[Macintyre] takes afresh look at the grandest espionage drama of our era.”—Walter Isaacson, New York Times Book Review“Superb… Riveting reading.” –Malcolm Gladwell, The New Yorker</p>
