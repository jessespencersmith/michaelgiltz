The End of Eddy
A Novel
by Ãdouard Louis, Michael Lucey
Price: $25.00 (Hardcover)

Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: An autobiographical novel about growing up gay in a
working-class town in Picardy.  Every morning in the bathroom I would
repeat the same phrase to myself over and over again . . . Today I'mreally gonna be a tough guy.  Growing up in a poor village in northern
France, all Eddy Bellegueule wanted was to be a man in the eyes of hisfamily and neighbors. But from childhood, he was different -- girlish,intellectually precocious, and attracted to other men. Already translatedinto twenty languages, The End of Eddy  captures the violence and
desperation of life in a French factory town. It is also a sensitive,universal portrait of boyhood and sexual awakening. Like Karl OveKnausgaard or Edmund White, Édouard Louis writes from his ownundisguised experience, but he writes with an openness and acompassionate intelligence that are all…

What We Say
The author Édouard Louis is a 24 year old French intellectual. That seems a reasonable designation since he's penned a
scholarly work on the philosopher Pierre Bourdieu, an impassioned political cri du coeur reprinted in English by the LosAngeles Review of Books and now an autobiographical first novel already translated in more than 20 languages. One looks
for and finds a blurb from Edmund White, which is only appropriate. However, "The End Of Eddy" does not have the
emotional resonance of White's classic "A Boy's Own Story" except in spurts. Louis grew up in a small village under veryimpoverished terms, battling against the constraining world in which he was born, a world that demanded he conform evenShare This Book

<p>though it knew perfectly well this feminine, girlish, high-voiced artistè, this orchid couldn't fit in no matter how desperately
he tried. Our hero is mercilessly accurate and quite funny in nailing the despairing voice of the people around him, the
poorly educated folk who drink themselves into a stupor at night and brawl with one another to hold at bay their unspoken,
almost unrecognized despair over the misery of their brutal lives. Much of the book feels repetitive for while Louis capturesthe voices of those around him -- often with empathy and even sympathy -- we circle the same ideas again and again.However, he's excellent at observing, at detailing the horrible "complicity" of the bullied (a complicity that is perhaps themost damaging aspect of it all). And the book springs to life when things happen: Eddy is horrified and delighted when his
older cousin initiates group sex with Eddy and two other young boys. He tries (and tries) to have a girlfriend. And the
escape of an arts scholarship outside of his town (and away from the bullies) is tellingly revealed as one small step and notthe complete rebirth Eddy (and we) hope for. If Louis has worked through all the insights he stored up in his young life,perhaps his next novel will embrace the narrative that powers the final third of this one. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Excellent . . . Already translated into 20 languages, this concise novel adroitly captures the downstream effects
of reactionary rural culture, heightened by the rise of hard-right ideology and the destabilization of the workingclass in contemporary Europe, granting its reader an extraordinary portrait of trauma and escape." ―PublishersWeekly (starred review) "A seamless, universal portrait of the experience of growing up gay and gradually comingto accept oneself." ―Michael Cart, Booklist (starred review) "[One of] Europe's new literary superstars . . . Evenin the wake of Knausgaard and Ferrante it is hard to find a literary phenomenon that has swept Europe quite
like the autobiographical project of Édouard Louis.” ―Ane Farsethas, LitHub "A bracingly pitiless account of the
psychic and physical violence that lies at the root of masculine identity. Louis's remarkably visceral story of
growing up queer in working class France quickly transcends its setting precisely because it delivers us into it
with such emotional force." ―Adam Haslett, author of Imagine Me Gone "Èdouard Louis speaks of violence, bothsocial and familiar, with tremendous force and feeling. Revelatory, queerly tough,…
