Broadway bares all 
PBS's six-hour documentary on the Great White Way is more than just another op'nin', 
another show By Michael Giltz 
Broadway: The Amelican 
Musical. Produced and directed by 
Michael Kantor. Written by Kantor and 
Laurence Ma.~lon. PBS. October 19-21, 
9 p.M.-ll P.M. Eastel11 (check local listings) 
t six hours, the new PBS docu­
mentary Broadway: The 
American Musical is far too 
short. You realize this especial­
ly in the last hour, which tries 
to gallop through 1980--2004, with nods 
to the AIDS crisis, the showmanship of 
producer Cameron Mackintosh, the rise 
of corporate backers like Disney, the 
passing of Jonathan Larson, 9/11, the 
megasuccess of Andrew Uoyd Webber, 
Wicked, Hairspray, La Cage aux Folles, 
and a little show called The Producers. 
Still, it's one of the most in-depth 
looks at Broadwa y ever attempted, and cowriter-director-producer Michael 
Kantor dutifully covers the high 
points-if he doesn't speak to stars like 
Carol Channing, Harvey Fierstein, 
Ethel Mennan, Nathan Lane, Stephen 
Sondheim, Fred Ebb, Al Jolson, Tom­
my Tune, Chita Rivera, Joel Grey, and 
countless others, you can be certain 
you'll see clips of them perfonuing. Air­
ing October 19-21, it's hosted by Julie 
Andrews (reason enough to tune in for 
some), and Kantor does a good job of 
showing how Broadway led and reflect­
ed popular culture from the Ziegfeld 
Follies through the early '70s. 
That relevance fades away in the 
last two episodes, of course, since 
Broadway no longer churns out popu­
lar tunes that dominate the radio or 
stars who tower over the culture. Now 
hit songs come to Broadway via 
THE ADVOCATE 1611 OCTOBER 26, 2004 ABBA's Mamma Mia! and Billy Joel's 
Movin' Out, while movie and TV stars 
pop in only for a visit. 
Nothing here is revelatory, but 
Broadway gets the job done. If noth­
ing else, its makers have certainly un­
earthed a treasure trove of footage. 
(One complaint: Kantor should have 
identified exactly what we're looking 
at, since it's not always clear-re­
hearsal footage? Opening night? A 
Tony Awards perfonnanc e? A TV spe­
cial? Who knows?) Still, anyone who 
cares about the Fabulous Invalid will 
be happy to hear that its songs (like "I 
Could Have Danced All Night") and its 
stories are as thrilling as ever .•
