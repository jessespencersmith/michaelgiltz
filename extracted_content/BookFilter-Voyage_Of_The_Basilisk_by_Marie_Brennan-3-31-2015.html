Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayMarie Brennan's fantasy series is an odd duck -- surely the Victorian era-like female naturalist at the center of it couldderive the taxonomy for this work better than I. It's technically a fantasy novel, set in a world akin to ours but withdifferent names for the various parts of the world...and the addition of dragons. Not talking dragons or magicaldragons; just dragons. Lady Trent has been fascinated by them since she was a little girl. In three books, she hasfollowed her passion, pushing back against proper behaviour for women of good breeding and by and large gettingwhat she wants: the chance to travel the world, study dragons and contribute to the scientific understanding of thesecreatures. As a naturalist, Trent makes an ideal heroine for a work of fantasy. Often the hardest part of a novel isintroducing a new society, a new concept and letting us understand what it means. Since this is precisely what agood scientist will do, Trent's observations make perfect sense. This was a bit stiffly done in the first book, better inthe second and quite satisfying in this her third adventure. It takes her to the equivalent of the South Seas, a potentialromance and invariably her dragon-spotting gets mixed up with political intrigue and military affairs. The series hasbecome stronger but its fantasy elements are modest, at best. It's really a Victorian travel pastiche with a twist. Fansof those might be put off by the fantasy. Fans of fantasy will surely wish there were more actual fantasy. But for thoseready to appreciate this strange new creature, it's a satisfying tale of no-nonsense female intrepidness...with a dashof dragons thrown in for good measure. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayThis, the second of Isabella's retrospective memoirs, is as uncompromisingly honest and forthright as the first,narrated in Brennan's usual crisp, vivid style, with a heroine at once admirable, formidable, and captivating. Reader,lose no time in making Isabella's acquaintance.What You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
