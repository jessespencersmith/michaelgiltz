Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: The magnificent new novel by the gifted, singular
#1 New York Times  bestselling author of  Winter’s Tale  and A Soldier of the
Great War  Mark Helprin’s powerful, rapturous new novel is set in a
present-day Paris caught between violent unrest and its well-known,inescapable glories. Seventy-four-year-old Jules Lacour―a  maître  at Paris-
Sorbonne, cellist, widower, veteran of the war in Algeria, and child of the
Holocaust―must find a balance between his strong obligations to the past
and the attractions and beauties of life and love in the present. In themidst of what should be an effulgent time of life―days bright with music,family, rowing on the Seine―Jules is confronted headlong and all at onceby a series of challenges to his principles, livelihood, and home, forcing
him to grapple with his complex past and find a way forward. He risks
fraud to save his terminally ill infant grandson, matches wits with arenegade insurance investigator, is drawn into an act of savage violence,and falls deeply, excitingly in love with a young cellist a third his age.
Against the backdrop of an exquisite and knowing vision of Paris and the
way it can uniquely shape a life, he forges a denouement that isstaggering in its humanity, elegance, and truth. In the intoxicating beautyof its prose and emotional amplitude of its storytelling, MarkHelprin’s  Paris in the Present Tense  is a soaring achievement, a deep,
dizzying look at a life through the purifying lenses of art and memory.

What We Say
As a long-time fan of Mark Helprin, I hoped his new novel would be a return to form. Not quite. Perhaps it's unfair but the
romantic style he typically employs on novels just isn't suited to stories set in the present. (In contrast, his short stories areoften diamond-sharp and quite distinct from the sprawling, 19th century richness of his full-length works.) Unfortunately,Share This Book

<p>despite some flashbacks to WW II, this novel is set in contemporary France and ultimately devolves into an insurance scam,
of all things. When tinged with fantasy and set in an alternate NYC, I can savor Helprin's grand passion, where every hero is
brave and true and smart and stoic and pure of heart while the women they love are invariably angels that glow with purity
and grace and joy and lightness. But when you're stuck in the present and talking about a cellist and his late wife or one ofhis students -- the routine people of today -- it feels absurd. I can't help resisting, when one of the strengths of his writinghas been the pleasure of giving in to old-fashioned plotting and a high-blown style perfect for knights and days of yore.Here, I kept thinking of Ayn Rand or Nietzsche's superman, and not in a good way. Moment to moment, this story of a
musician forced into desperate action when his grandchild is stricken with a dreadful disease has insight, humor and lovely
passages. Yet instead of being elevated by the prose, ultimately the story is weighed down. TV philosophers, multi-nationalconglomerates, email -- it all feels far too pedestrian a setting for his concerns. I prefer Helprin in the past tense. --Michael Giltz
