Dear Evan Hansen: The Novel
BOOKFILTER’S FALL PICKS FOR THEATER LOVERS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | OCTOBER 3, 2018
SHARE</p>
<p>By Val Emmich with Steven Levenson, Benj Pasek, and Justin Paul
$18.99, Poppy
This has to be the most anticipated theater book of the year. Tony winner Ben Platt’s
performance in the Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen  was so iconic and acclaimed, it was
possible that without him in the cast, the mania for the show would die down. Turns out, nope.
The show is stronger than ever, proving it wasn’t just a great performance but a great role thatother actors can tackle and bring their own insight to. So now here comes Dear Evan Hansen:The Novel,  a young-adult adaptation of the show with writer Val Emmich building on the book,
music, and lyrics of Steven Levenson and the team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Has aBroadway show ever been turned into a YA novel before? I don’t think so. Will it answer thequestions some have about the social anxiety disorder that plagues Evan? Undoubtedly. But forthis October 9 release to come alive, it will have to stand on its own. Early reviews from fans arepositive, and soon even those who can’t get to Broadway or wait for the national tour to come totheir town will be able to dive into this story and this world. Though if they play the cast albumwhile reading it, well, who could blame them?
Kathleen Turner on Acting</p>
<p>By Kathleen Turner and Dustin Morrow
$24.99, Skyhorse Publishing
All the fuss over Kathleen Turner’s new memoir/master class in acting has focused on her
bawdy sense of humor, truth telling about what it’s like for a woman in the film, TV, and theaterindustry, and, of course, any dirt she’s willing to dish about costars and the like. That’s a shame,because the core of this dialogue is about her insight into acting. From classic performances onfilm in Body Heat  and War of the Roses  to Tony-winning turns in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof  and
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,  Turner has a lot to share. Actors and fans, pay attention.
When the Curtain Falls</p>
<p>By Carrie Hope Fletcher
$24.99, Sphere
Actress Carrie Hope Fletcher has performed in the West End since she was 7 years old
(Eponine, natch). Right now she’s the lead in Heathers: The Musical. But her second career, as
a vlogger on YouTube , brought Fletcher fans all over the world, and that led to a No. 1 memoir
and several novels. Her latest is a romantic cross between Phantom of the Opera  and, well, any
show where two actors performing together fall in love. It begins in 1952 when star-crossed
lovers acting in a debut play are thwarted by an obsessive interloper. And then it flashes to thepresent, when two more young lovers fall hard while performing in a revival of that same play,only to find themselves plagued by a ghost. They realize that long-ago romance must becelebrated before their own story can move ahead. It’s a diverting tale filled with the details onlyan actor can spot and share.
American Theatre Wing: An Oral History
By Patrick Pacheco
$45, Graphic Arts Books
Author Patrick Pacheco was tasked with the duty of sharing stories celebrating 100 years of the
American Theatre Wing, and thus 100 years of American theater, from Broadway to Off-Broadway and regional scenes all over the country. Obviously, no single book — however thick— could do justice to it all. But with never-before-seen photos and anecdotes from a who’s whothat includes Angela Lansbury, Harvey Fierstein, Audra McDonald, Harold Prince, Patti LuPone,
Neil Patrick Harris, and so many others, well, you can hardly go far wrong, either.</p>
<p>Torch Song Trilogy
By Harvey Fierstein
$17, Ballantine Books
Just in time for its return to Broadway, Harvey Fierstein’s Tony winner for Best Play gets a new
edition. You’ll find the complete scripts for the original three one-act plays, the newly revisedversion  that streamlines it down, a fresh introduction from Fierstein, and photos from both the
Broadway run and the 2017 Off-Broadway production starring Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruhlthat is opening this month on the Great White Way. The only way it could be better was ifFierstein came over for coffee and cake to chat and answer your questions about this, KinkyBoots,  and so much more from his remarkable career. Did you know that before puberty
Fierstein was a soprano in a professional boys’ choir? A soprano! Just one more fact from awonderfully impossible life.
Jerome Robbins: A Life in Dance</p>
<p>By Wendy Lesser
$25, Yale University Press
Choreographer and director Jerome Robbins led a tumultuous, fascinating life. But he will be
remembered for his work. If you want gossip about how difficult he was to work with or thedrama backstage on West Side Story,  look elsewhere. This slim volume stays focused on what
matters: dance. Author Wendy Lesser looks at his life and career with insight and empathy,always observing the man and the work through the art form that made his name.
The Detroit Project
By Dominique Morisseau</p>
<p>$16.95, Theatre Communications Group
Recently, a survey from American Theatre  magazine detailed the most performed plays and
playwrights of the current 2018–2019 season at regional theatres around the country. (They
didn’t include Shakespeare or holiday shows like A Christmas Carol .) Appearing on both lists?
Playwright Dominique Morisseau. So what better time to dive into this collection? It includesthree of Morisseau’s plays: Paradise Blue, Detroit ’67  (both solid), and the brilliant Skeleton
Crew. The latter play is in the top-10 of most produced plays and Morisseau herself ranks at No.3 on the list of most produced authors. Find out why.
Mad Scenes and Exit Arias
By Heidi Waleson
$30, Metropolitan Books
When the New York City Opera went belly-up in 2013, it was a shock — despite 70 years of
near-death experiences and enough behind-the-scenes drama to fuel a hundred arias. WallStreet Journal  opera critic Heidi Waleson tells the story and doesn’t stint on the inevitable ego
clashes and larger-than-life personalities. However, she also tells a deeper story about thefading presence of orchestral music and opera companies (high art, if you like) and theirprecarious financial straits. Anyone who misses NYCO, loves opera, or worries about the futureof their local symphony should dive in.
Contemporary Monologues for a New Theater</p>
<p>Edited by Cate Cammarata
$16.99, Applause Theatre & Cinema Books
Every play is political. The mere fact of telling this story rather than that, of giving voice and
presence to this person instead of that one, speaks volumes. Applause presents its latestcollection of monologues through a spectrum of diversity and insight. Including almost 100monologues, this compilation, edited by Cate Cammarata, includes a range of mostly new andsome established voices perfect for actors looking for work that includes their own experiencesand readers looking for work that opens them up to new ones.
Broadway to Main Street</p>
<p>By Laurence Maslon
$34.95, Oxford University Press
In the 1950s and 1960s, Broadway cast albums were hugely popular, holding their own on the
charts alongside Frank Sinatra and the Beatles. Indeed, cast albums held the No. 1 spot on theBillboard charts for longer than all the albums by Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and the Beatlescombined. (Smash hits like The Sound of Music  and My Fair Lady  will do that for a genre.)
Laurence Maslon tells the story of the cast album in this book, subtitled How Show TunesEnchanted America.  He delves deep into the influence of technology — how the 78 and the LP
changed the way shows were recorded and remembered — as well as the business ofBroadway. Far from the usual musical anecdotes, Maslon offers a surprising and rich new anglefrom which to appreciate the art form and the cold, hard realities of money and profit that makeit possible.
The Man Who Couldn’t Miss
By David Handler
$26.99, William Morrow
We all love theater, but for those who also love a good mystery, there’s a special thrill in seeing
those two worlds collide. They simply can’t resist a mystery with a showbiz setting. And thatmeans the acclaimed, long-running series starring amateur sleuth Stewart Hoag is already afavorite for many. A ghostwriter in Hollywood, most of Stewart’s tales are set in the world of film.But this time Stewart and his beloved basset hound, Lulu, find themselves embroiled in a
murder at a summer playhouse in Connecticut, where Stewart’s ex-wife (Oscar winner Merilee) is</p>
<p>directing a gala benefit of Private Lives.  But a dead body spoils the fun (a supporting player, no
one terribly important, darling) and Stewart is called in to save the day. If you’re already feeling
eager to read it, this one’s for you.
Nate Expectations
By Tim Federle
$17.99, Simon & Schuster
Tim Federle’s best-selling and beloved series about a middle-grade kid besotted with theater
comes to an end with the third and final volume of the trilogy. Nate didn’t find fame and fortunewhen the show E.T.: The Musical  bombed on Broadway, so he’s back in his hometown in
Pennsylvania … and his freshman year of high school. He’d rather be rehearsing his Tonyspeech (who wouldn’t?), but the out-and-proud Nate instead decides to oversee a musicaladaptation of Great Expectations.  Sweet and open to all orientations (as long as you love
Broadway), the Nate series shows everyone loves a dreamer.
The Spy of Venice</p>
<p>By Benet Brandreth
$25.95, Pegasus Books
In truth, this tale of young Will Shakespeare–as-spy owes more of a debt to Alexander Dumas
than to the Bard, what with the flashing swordplay, scheming popes, honest courtesans who areas beautiful as they are brilliant, and the like. Still, theater buffs will delight in the winkingwordplay and count themselves clever for spotting so much of it. And anyone who enjoys agood romp will be satisfied and eager for the sequel.

Playing to the Gods</p>
<p>By Peter Rader
$26; Simon & Schuster
This dual biography tells the stories of two of the greatest stage actresses in history: Sarah
Bernhardt (the Divine One, as good at self-promotion as she was at acting) and Eleanora Duse(a self-effacing artist who pioneered modern acting). It’s juicy and delightful, so anyone wholoves theater, acting in general, and strong women from history in particular will enjoy Playing tothe Gods  very much.
