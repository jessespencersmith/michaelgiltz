tome that charts a stuffy path through the major signposts of Americanmusical theater. Instead, it’s a can’t-read-just-one compilation of stories andtales plucked from the byways of showbiz lore, like the head-spinning factthat Frank Sinatra almost appeared in the original Fiddler on the Roof. Dip

Now one of those pioneers — Donna Kaz, a.k.a. AphraBehn — has come forward, taken off her mask, and told her story, whichincludes domestic abuse, a lifelong love of theater, and how artistic activism
can be just as creative and fun and fulfilling as treading the boards. Learn

with Untimely Death.  Costume designer Charlotte Fairfax must juggle her
responsibilities with the Catskills Shakespeare Theatre Company whileinvestigating a murder that has ensnared the soon-to-be-married daughterof one of their biggest patrons.

NAMING THY NAME: CROSS TALK IN SHAKESPEARE’S SONNETS
By Elaine Scarry$27, Farrar Straus and Giroux
Sure, this focuses on the sonnets and not the plays, but anything about</p>
<p>Shakespeare is of interest, and this work of literary scholarship is an
academic blockbuster. Among author Elaine Scarry’s numerousaccomplishments here, she convincingly names poet Henry Constable asShakespeare’s great love, James I as the Rival Poet, suggests Constablewas by his side when Shakespeare died and signed his will, and  attributes
an unsigned poem about the widely beloved Constable to Shakespeare forgood measure. Any one of these would be a brash claim. But Scarry does it all, usingscholarship, biography, and a close reading of the sonnets to tie it all together in a web of
interlocking clues and insight that illuminate his series of poems like never before. Learn more.
