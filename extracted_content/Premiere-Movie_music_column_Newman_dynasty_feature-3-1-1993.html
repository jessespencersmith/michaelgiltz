legendary, the compos- • Heathers (Varese Sara­

tively unknown . From the score that demonstrates David 
great Alfred Newman and his >­
brothers Lionel and Emil to his i!l

nephew Randy, the impact of it 
this musical family on movie 
history has been enormous. And 
it continues unabated-Thomas 
provided a lovely score for Seem Randy Newman, whose best 
pop albums have a cinematic 
feel. In this baseball fable, his 
music is nostalgic and gripping 
at the same timc-a nice trick. 
• The Sound and the Fury 
(Varese Sarabande). This fine 
effort by Alex North provides 
Lionel Newman a chance to 
shine as conductor. 
• The Robe (Varcse Sara-
of a Woman, and David did the 
honors for Hoffa. Sadly, much of 
the older generation's work isn't 
widely available (and virtually 
anything you see with Alfred 
Newman's name on it is worth a

• The Rapture (Polydor). This 
marvelous Thomas Newman 
score combines a dark, passion­
ate style with great songs by 
Irma Thomas, Meredith Monk,

you're at it, check out Thom­

edy. Usually working in an 
orchestral style, David came 
into his own through collabo­
rations with director Danny 
DeVito (on ThrolV Momllla 
From the Train, The War of the 
Roses, and now Hoffa).

date rather quickly, but this 
score is one of the better ef­
forts, and one of the few Alfred 
Newman albums that's easy to 
find. Get it while you're wait­
ing for The Song of Bemadette , 
HolV Green Was My Valley, and 
countless others .
