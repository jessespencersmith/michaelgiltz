 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: Tinker Tailor  Quietly
Brilliant; Peak for Oldman
TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY  ($34.99 BluRay combo; Universal) -- it's not as if this sober, subtle
spy film was ignored -- it was one of the most acclaimed films of the year and received three Oscar
nominations. But I think the stock of this remarkable achievement is going to rise steadily. Frankly, Iwould have thought condensing the convoluted, indirect, intellectual novel by John Le Carre into afeature film was impossible. (The British did it with a terrific miniseries starring Alex Guinness, but thatwas a seven part miniseries.) Instead, the compact film meant that audiences could concentrate intentlyon the tale of intrigue and betrayal unfolding before our eyes, including a career peak for actor GaryOldman as George Smiley, a role I thought belonged forever to Guinness. Every element is superb andabove all it's a sensational second feature from director Tomas Alfredson ( Let The Right One In ). He's a
major talent we'll be watching for years to come.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>I. CLAUDIUS  ($59.99; Acorn) -- From a new classic to an all-time great. This BBC miniseries based on
the novel by Robert Graves is often cited as one of the greatest TV shows of all time. I've said so myself.
But how does it hold up? It's been 20 or 30 years since I've watched it and I worried it might seem a bit
stagey or tame given what's followed. This is The Sopranos  in Rome and maybe all the shows that have
come since will make it look stodgy. Ha! First, this newly remastered set looks simply terrific. And the
story of betrayal and lust and madness in ancient Rome (with good old stuttering-but-clever Claudius
staying quietly in the background and outliving them all) is as soapy and compelling and fun as ever.
What a cast! Sian Phillips is stunning as the power-mad Livia, who'd poison her own husband or son to
get what she wants. But she's just one of many, including Brian Blessed, Patrick Stewart and of courseDerek Jacobi in the title role. Thirty-five years on and it's as compelling as ever. Indeed, one of the all-time greats.
THE MUPPETS  ($49.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- One of the year's most delightful surprises, Jason
Segal co-wrote and stars in a sweet, successful update of the Muppets that features good songs, all yourfavorite characters, celebrity cameos and just the right mix of knowingness and simplicity (the Muppetsare never arch or ironic, thank goodness). Yet again, the Muppets need to defeat a bad guy and put on ashow to save their run-down amusement park/theater. It's easily the best Muppet movie since theoriginal. Here's hoping they maintain the high standards in the movies to come. And yes, get theMuppets to host the Oscars!

<p>THE SWELL SEASON  ($29.95; Docurama)
BATTLE ROYALE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION  ($49.99 BluRay; Anchor Bay) -- Here are two
releases for people needing a new fix on their favorite loves. Fans of The Swell Season  and the Broadway
show Once  can turn to this documentary for a look at the couple at their center. Following them for three
years, it watches as their romance fades but they find a way to continue to collaborate fruitfully. Sad but
sweet. And if you have already seen The Hunger Games  three times and read the books over and over
again, why not dive into the Japanese version that got there first?  Battle Royale  was a novel about a class
of students plucked out of their lives and placed on an island to battle to the death. It was always
compared to Lord Of the Flies  until The Hunger Games  books came out. You can read the book and then
watch the two films in this deluxe set, which includes the fun original, a director's cut, a lesser sequel and
a disc of extras. It is even more hyper-violent than The Hunger Games , so parents take note.
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion)
TITANIC: THE COMPLETE STORY  ($19.95; History/New Video) -- With the 100th anniversary,
we're being crushed with Titanic -related programming from a new miniseries to a 3-D reissue of the
James Cameron blockbuster, books, articles and on and on and on. But if you take the time to watch only
one new release, make sure it's A Night to Remember,  the sober, quietly moving British film from 1958

<p>that was scripted by the spy novelist Eric Ambler and is noted for its then-up-to-date historical accuracy,
ability to keep the human drama in the forefront and a reserve that makes the tragedy all the more
moving. Not surprisingly, Criterion provides loads of great extras, including audio commentary, a 60
minute making-of film, a 50 minute BBC documentary about the disaster, a Swedish show interviewing
survivors and archival footage of another survivor, Eva Hart. If you haven't completely gorged, the
History Channel's collection of three documentaries is more than 5 hours in all.</p>

EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE  ($35.99 BluRay combo; Warner Bros.)
CARNAGE  ($35.99 BluRay combo; Sony) 
IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY  ($40.99 BluRay combo; Sony)
MELANCHOLIA  ($29.98 BluRay; Magnolia) -- Ah, the best laid plans.... Here are six films made with
passion and care and the highest expectations. They all fall short, which makes it all the more remarkable
when movies do work. These certainly had everything going for them. Most would call The Descendants  a
major success and rightly so. It enjoyed critical acclaim and serious box office all over the world. I thinkit's a step back from the brink for director Alexander Payne and certainly George Clooney is as good asever while Shailene Woodley is one to watch. But for me, the drama was essentially inert -- I never feltterribly involved and kept wondering about the central dilemma: wouldn't the government of Hawaiiwant to buy the land for a state park, keeping everyone happy? You'd be hard pressed to find anyone whothought this Dragon  was better than the foreign language original. Plus, the books becomes increasingly
un-cinematic (the foreign trilogy dropped hard in the grosses for movies two and three) so I'd think longand hard before making the sequel. You know a film is in trouble when it's scared of its central storyline -</p>
<p>- Extremely Loud  was always desperate to insist it's NOT about 9/11, but 
"about every day after." Except, of course, it is about 9/11, just not very interestingly. Carnage  should
have been a slam-dunk but the thin but well-constructed play by Yasmina Reza loses what power it has
when you're not literally trapped in a room (or theater) with these characters. A fine cast brings some fun
to the proceedings but it's not enough. Angelina Jolie has every right to be proud of her film debut. But it
takes a lot of work to grow as a director and not everyone can be Charles Laughton or Orson Welles right
out of the box. Next time, she should take on someone's else's script. She's smart enough to make a good
director but you know what it takes to get to Carnegie Hall. Finally, Melancholia  is a fairly dull end of the
world saga set in a stately home (not exactly the sort of folk designed to elicit sympathy as the world
comes crashing down). But what a sensational opening scene -- it's worth owning just to show off yourhome theater system.
THE BBC NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTION ON BLURAY  ($134.99 BluRay; BBC/2Entertain)
THE BBC NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTION ON DVD  ($179.98 DVD; BBC/2Entertain) -- The
BBC has so thoroughly raised the standards of natural history programming that it makes Wild Kingdomfrom my youth look like kiddie stuff. You really should be watching Frozen Planet  Sunday nights on
Discovery. And either one of these sets will give you a wealth of amazing television. They both ratherconfusingly have the same name but contain mostly different specials. The BluRay set is of course demo-ready and it contains the terrific show Planet Earth , along with Wild China, Ganges  and Galapagos . All
look sensational though Planet Earth  is head and shoulders above as programming. The DVD set (which
contains 18 discs) is the artistic high point. It features Planet Earth  and the landmark Blue Planet,  as well
as David Attenborough's The Life of Mammals  and The Life Of Birds.  It's absorbing television of the
highest order. You can bet that Blue Planet  and Planet Earth  will be packaged with Frozen Planet
someday soon on BluRay and, if you're like me, you already own at least one of them. But as a starter set,
either one is going to blow you away.
MOST TITLES LISTED HERE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE FORMATS AND IN MULTIPLE
COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING DVD, BLURAY, DIGITAL DOWNLOAD, VOD, STREAMING AND THELIKE. THE FORMAT LISTED IS THE FORMAT PROVIDED FOR REVIEW, NOT ALL THE FORMATSAVAILABLE. IT IS OFTEN THE MOST EXPENSIVE VERSION WITH THE MOST EXTRAS. DO CHECKINDIVIDUAL TITLES FOR AVAILABILITY IN ALL THEIR VARIOUS GUISES AND PRICE POINTS.

TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY was too complex a story for film.
See the TV series instead.The acting is just as good if not better.

Tinker Tailor was not an entertaining movie. Ask anyone that saw it except for a film critic.
