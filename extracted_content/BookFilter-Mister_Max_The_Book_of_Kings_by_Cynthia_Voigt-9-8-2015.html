Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayApparently, I need to catch up on my Cynthia Voigt. This excellent conclusion to her Mister Max trilogy has left me alittle gobsmacked, if I'm honest. Did she plan the ramping up of the complexity and emotional depth the way it playedout? I read all three books within a few weeks so perhaps that helped me appreciate the arc even more. Anyway, Isuppose you could read the third book alone, but why would you? It's a trilogy and meant to be read that way. InBook One, Max lives in a quaint sort of turn of the century kingdom with his parents who run a theatrical troupe. Maxloves them and the theater but it's not quite his thing. Exactly what his thing will be, this 12 year old boy isn't quitesure about. His parents are lured to a far-away country to establish a new national theater company and Max isaccidentally left behind with his librarian grandmother. They realize the parents have been kidnapped and worry andworry and worry. To maintain his independence, Max becomes sort of a detective, though he insists on callinghimself The Solutioneer. (Why the books aren't called The Solutioneer remains a mystery to me.) There's also a girlthat annoys Max with all her questions and a boarder in Max's home who has a mysterious past and other danglingthreads. So there's the set up. At first, Max solves rather mundane or obvious problems like finding a lost dog. InBook Two, however, Voigt takes a quantum leap forward: Max is now solving problems of the human heart andshowing a great deal of insight. In Book Three, Max and his friends head off to rescue the boy's parents in the LatinAmerican dictatorship they're trapped in. The final volume is especially good, with remarkably complex passagesdepicting that awkward moment when a child sees their parents as people, flaws and all, not to mention somecompletely earned but still bravura changes that make clear the pattern Voigt was creating from the very start. ReadBook One alone and -- like me -- you might consider it a pleasant diversion, with so-so mysteries but appealingcharacters. Book Two is much better and Book Three deepens the entire work. It's like a magic trick the way shesuddenly reveals the life Max was intended for all along. I plan to read more Voigt right away. Highly recommended. -- Michael Giltz P.S. I'm convinced we'll see more of Mister Max and his eyes, which are an odd sort of grey, perhapsthe grey of a computer screen when you've just powered it down and the energy seems to be draining away orperhaps the grey of a London fog when you don't quite know where you're going and there's no other light aroundexcept the dull glow of street lamps that haven't been cleaned in a while, a murky sort of menacing but perhaps notreally dangerous grey. Something like that.LessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
