B,D, Wong was thrilled by Pacific Overtures when he was a kid, 
Now he's in the lead By Michael Giltz 
urely it's fate that B.D. Wong 
would star in the first Broad­
way revival of Stephen Sond­
heim's Pacific Overtures. After 
all, it's the show that con­
vinced the Tony-winning Wong that he 
could be an actor in the first place. 
"It came through San Francisco right 
after it closed on Broadway," says Wong 
during a break from rehearsals for the show, which opens on December 2. "I 
chased [the star) Mako down the street 
after the performance and got his auto­
graph on my Playbill and kept it forever." 
Wong is also busy editing Social 
Grace, the first film he has directed. 
Somewhere in between, he films 
episodes of Law & Order: Special Vic­
tims Unit and, of course, cares for his 
4-year-old son. All of this activity he 
THE ADVOCATE I 64 I DECEMBER 7, 2004 traces to seeing Pacific Overtures that 
first time. 
The 42-year-old Wong struggles to ex­
plain exactly what that moment meant: 
"It meant that if I wanted to be an 
actor-which I did; I was extremely pas­
sionate about school plays-and I was 
cursed-and you know I use the word 
with tongue in cheek-in my body and in 
my race, I was not going to be banished 
to a life of playing horrible, menial, em­
barrassing, and demeaning roles. I was 
energized with a sense of hope." 
Wong-who shot to fame and won 
every award in sight with his legendary 
Broadway turn as a gender-bending 
spy in M. Butterfly-says the most ex­
citing part of this show is getting to 
work with Sondheim. He explains pas­
sionately why having the show helmed 
by a Japanese director, Amon Miyamo­
to, lets Pacific Overtures resonate in 
ways it never did before. "It's similar to 
the idea that gay actors give gay roles 
more resonance. A brilliant nongay 
actor can be brilliant in a gay part. And 
yet there's something that often hap­
pens when a gay actor plays a gay role 
that is extremely powerful. The pain is 
true. The joy is true. And any gay per­
son can identify it immediately." 
Wong is loath to discuss his private 
life other than to say that he and his long­
time partner Richie (who have apparent­
ly broken up and reportedly no longer 
live together) love and respect each 
other and are taking their son together 
on interviews for kindergarten. But 
Wong doesn't hesitate to say that coming 
out in The Advocate in June 2003 was a 
powerful, positive experience. 
"I've come to the point very recent­
ly-in the last five years, definitely--of 
fully understanding that who I am is a 
great thing," he says. "I don't mean I'm 
better than anyone else, but I used to 
really bemoan my gayness and my 
Asian-ness. They were intertwined in­
extricably. I could not separate what 
bothered me more about myself, what 
gave me more pain." 
How did it change? "The core of that 
is parenthood," says Wong. "The father­
hood led to coming out, and coming out 
led to feeling extremely liberated. The 
coming-out released me from shame, 
and releasing myself from shame 
helped me to ... see, I don't know. To see 
me through [my son's) eyes? I don't 
know. It's just very positive." •</p>
