Theater: "The Big Chill" Plus Ghosts Equals Anne
Washburn's Latest

ANTLIA PNEUMATICA  ** 1/2 out of ****
PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZON
I've never attended a terribly exciting funeral, but then I'm the sort of person who also skips high school
reunions. Or maybe enough of my friends haven't died yet. In any case, the death of someone bringing the oldgang back together is a tried and true formula, from movies like Return Of The Secaucus Seven  (aka The Big
Chill before Hollywood stepped in) to this new play by Anne Washburn.
Coming off the rousing success of her post-apocalyptic comedy Mr. Burns,  you won't be surprised to know
that Washburn is not terribly interested in formula. Or rather, a fear of the familiar pushes her to abandon thestrong characters and witty dialogue she starts the play with and head off into the stratosphere. Washburn hasa lot on her mind, including parenting, the supernatural, childhood and food, lots of food. But she shies awayfrom all that, ending up with a vague monologue about lost passion, the hint of a ghost story and a finale thatstrives for an open-ended sense of eeriness. The result frustrates more than it intrigues
Theater: "The Big Chill" Plus Ghosts Equals Anne Washburn's Latest</p>
<p>Nina (a very good Annie Parisse) is preparing for an influx of friends, there to commemorate the death of one
of their own. Sure they've drifted apart but this passing should be celebrated. And that means food! Shelaunches into prep work that would make a major restaurant chain proud as others drift in and out. Eventually,we get to know her wry sister Liz (April Mathis); pal Ula (Maria Striar); the amiable Len (Nat DeWolf), who hasfun playing with the kids on hand; and old flame Adrian (Rob Campbell), who broke Nina's heart long ago andreally, no one can believe he's actually going to show. But show he does.
A late arrival by Bama (an amusing Crystal Finn) offers more welcome humor. But truly the play has all sorts of
humor on tap, with every actor given a juicy speech or distinctive banter for them to toss out. Campbell's Natmay be the exception, which is due to the writing, not his performance. Adrian must be the mysterious centerof the show and yet a quiet remove doesn't quite get us there. Plus, they refer to his past with Nina in suchdire terms I kept thinking it had to be something far darker and more upsetting than merely (?) breaking herheart. Yet perhaps not, since precisely what he did that was so despicable isn't illuminated.
Instead, Adrian is given a rambling, somewhat romantic discourse on constellations, Nina is given a chance to
see if she still wants what might have been...and then even this modest moment of actual plot development isundercut by Washburn choosing to muddy up what's going on in unconvincing and an inconsistent manner.(If nothing else, Adrian should certainly decline a sangria when he arrives. Ghost story 101, if you want tokeep things uncertain.)
It's rather frustrating to know Washburn could meet the demands of a more traditional play but wouldn't
commit. (Maybe she identifies with Adrian too much?) Antlia Pneumatica  is certainly well acted, well directed
by Ken Rus Schmoll and given a handsome production by scenic designer Rachel Hauck.
For a seemingly conventional play, it's also rather bold and interesting in its sound design, thanks to
Washburn's writing and its execution by Leah Gelpe. The show begins with Nina offstage talking on a cellphone. We hear her voice though the stage is empty and this is done in a way that -- somehow -- we don'treally expect her to appear, giving that entrance a modest little jolt. (Similarly, actors often pop out fromoffstage in a way designed to keep them hidden until the last possible moment, another admirable detaildemonstrating the presentation is in sync with the story.)
Two children in the show are only heard from off-stage, either nearby or talking in scenes that take place
separate from the action at hand. This use of sound should be applauded and is a reminder of how little thetheater makes use of sound design beyond the expected atmospherics. Yet even here Antlia Pneumatica fallsa little short: this notable quirk isn't really explored or used in a consistent manner, used first for one effect andlater for another and ultimately not adding up to much. Just like, I fear, the show itself.
