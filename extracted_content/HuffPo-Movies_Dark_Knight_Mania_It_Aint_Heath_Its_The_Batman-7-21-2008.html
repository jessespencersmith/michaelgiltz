Dark Knight  Mania: It Ain't

Here's the truth about The Dark Knight's  record-
breaking box office. The only surprise would have
been if the latest Batman movie DIDN'T have amassive opening weekend. Almost no otherfranchise in US movie history can claim theopening weekend hysteria generated by BruceWayne and the Caped Crusader. Not that you'dknow it reading the traditional media.
The New York Times  quoted Warner Bros.
disingenuously claiming to be delightfully
surprised.  "It just took on a life of its own," said Dan Fellman, Warner's president for theatrical
distribution. "You never expect anything like this."
And the Associated Press quoted a usually reliable box office analyst as follows: "The average
opening gross of the last five Batman  movies is $47 million. This tripled that, and for a reason,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Media By Numbers. "A big part of that was the Heath Ledgermystique and a phenomenal performance that absolutely deserves the excitement surrounding it."(Dergarabedian ignores how huge those opening numbers were for their time.)
The goofiest line of all? The New York Times  writing, "That the film's opening took on an event
status that previous Batman  movies never quite achieved apparently owed something to its strong
presence in IMAX format."Huh? Is Cieply so young he doesn't remember the absolute hysteria surrounding Tim Burton's
Batman  and another acclaimed, memorable Joker (as embodied by Jack Nicholson)? And IMAX is
negligible hype: the movie grossed $6.2 million on 94 IMAX screens. Assuming a third of thatgross is the IMAX surchage (roughly $12 a ticket instead of $8, which is a very rough estimate),that means playing in IMAX meant The Dark Knight  grossed an extra... wait for it... $2 million.

<p>Michael Giltz: Dark Knight Mania: It Ain't Heath; It's The Batman
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emdark-knightem-mania-it_b_114145.html [4/5/2009 1:59:46 PM]Out of $158.3 million total gross. Big whoop. Warner Bros. wasn't surprised and the big opening
weekend wasn't just because of Heath.
Here's the truth: ignoring the Adam West quickie from 1966,  the Batman franchise has released six
movies . FOUR of them have set the all-time opening weekend box office record.  The only two that
didn't were the deservedly maligned Batman & Robin  in 1997 and the acclaimed reboot Batman
Begins in 2005 which made this film's success possible.
That's right. Four times out of six, a Batman  movie has set or reclaimed the title for Biggest
Opening Weekend Of All Time. No other franchise in history  comes close to that record. Not Star
Wars . Not Harry Potter . Not Spider-Man . Not The Lord Of The Rings . No one. Here are the
figures:Batman  (1989) grossed $40.3 million its opening weekend, an all-time record. (And since I was
wearing my Batman Underoos to opening day, that's event status in my book.) It held the record
until...
Batman Returns  (1992), which grossed $45.6 million. That movie was topped by Jurassic Park,
which grossed $50.1 million in 1993 and held the title until it was one-upped by...
Batman Forever  (1995), which grossed $52 million. It held the record until The Lost World:
Jurassic Park  took it back in 1997 with $72 million and held the crown until Harry Potter  arrived
on the scene in 2001. Records have fallen ever since with numbing regularity, thanks to a huge
number of multiplexes that can show a movie like The Dark Knight  on staggered showtimes on
four or five or even all of their available screens. (Ironically, DVDs have made movies so
omnipresent that people who spend the money at the movies want it to be an event; hence the
drive towards round-the-clock screenings on opening day and get-there-first hysteria for fans.)
As for Heath Ledger, he was an exceptional actor but not yet a movie star. And no one becomes a
huge box office draw simply by dying. This isn't an insult to Ledger; it's a compliment and a plea toremember him as an artist. Prior to The Dark Knight,  his biggest opening weekend was his
breakthrough role in A Knight's Tale way back in 2001. (I'm not counting his supporting turn inThe Patriot  since that was clearly Mel Gibson's movie and Ledger was along for the ride.) Most
people were not ghoulishly turning out to see The Dark Knight  because Ledger had died tragically
young. They were turning out because the franchise was always a monster draw, the movie wasgetting the best reviews of any Hollywood film so far this year (along with Wall-E ) and the buzz
about Ledger's performance (just like the buzz about Jack Nicholson's performance in 1989) wasicing on the cake.
And don't freak out when the box office drops by 70% or whatever next weekend. That's to be
expected. In fact, the Batman  franchise has almost always been about huge opening weekends and
quick drop-offs. (I'd say it's because all of the movies -- until now, arguably -- have beenunsatisfying.) Yes, the 1989 edition became the 6th top grossing movie of all time in the US(behind Star Wars, ET, Return of The Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back  and Jaws .) But the next two
set opening weekend records and yet didn't even come close to breaking into the Top 10 of All-Time Top Grossers. Still, with The Dark Knight's  nihilism so in tune with a bleak economic
forecast and seemingly never-ending war overseas, perhaps this one will turn the tide. One boldprognosticator insisted The Dark Knight  would NOT beat Titanic 's $600 million record in the US.
(That's always a safe bet.) But if it drops by less than 60% in its second weekend, $400 million+ isvery likely and The Dark Knight  should put Batman right back in the Top 10 of all time for the first
time in 20 years instead of just an opening weekend phenomenon. (Interestingly, the Batmanfranchise has always been a poor draw overseas -- only the hated Batman & Robin  grossed more
outside the US than in it. That could turn around too.)
So let's remember Ledger as a talented actor whose best work was ahead of him, not as some sort
of perverse trivia question. And anyone who is surprised by the opening weekend hysteria for TheDark Knight  simply doesn't know their box office history..
To read more on Huffington about the franchise and Ledger, you can ponder Joshua David Stein'sthoughts on the movie's moral bleakness, catch Alex Remington's  rave review, Erik Lundegaard's
reappraisal of the earlier flicks (including Batman Forever ), Charles Karel Bouley  and Kim
Morgan  on Ledger's performance, and Hugh Hamilton  on the movie's political significance.

Why say "hate to tell you?" Unlike others who make crazy predictions based on a day or two
of box office, I said you should look closely at the second weekend numbers. It appears(given the terrific box office on Monday) that The Dark Knight might very well drop 60% orless its second weekend, which would mean it is well positioned to become only the 8th film inUS history to gross $400 million+. Since it's arguably the best reviewed Hollywood movie ofthe year and I'm a huge fan of Christian Bale, I couldn't be happier for it. That doesn't changethe fact that the Batman franchise has traditionally been an opening weekend phenomenonwith no follow-through. This looks like the first one since 1989's Batman to be an honest to
goodness smash hit.
