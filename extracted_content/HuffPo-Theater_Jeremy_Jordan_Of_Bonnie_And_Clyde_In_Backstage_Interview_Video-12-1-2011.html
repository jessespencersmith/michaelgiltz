 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater Exclusive: Jeremy Jordan Of
"Bonnie & Clyde" In BackstageInterview (Video)
Actor Jeremy Jordan  is enjoying one of the splashiest
moments on Broadway for a newcomer in recent
memory. Jordan starred in the new musical Newsies  at
the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.  The lavish
Disney production was intended to create a property
that could be mounted in high schools and community
theaters, but the show was so well reviewed it is jumpingdirectly to Broadway in March of 2012.
But Jordan won't be appearing in the show on
Broadway. He's already there. It's not his first time on the Great White Way: Jordan's been the swing in
Rock of Ages  and played Tony two times a week in a revival of West Side Story . But for the first time
Jordan is creating the lead role in a new Broadway musical: Bonnie & Clyde  by composer Frank
Wildhorn. At one point, Jordan was appearing nightly to packed houses in Newsies  and working on
creating the role of gangster Clyde Barrow during the day. How did a relatively unknown like Jordanland such two high profile gigs at the same time? It helped that both were being directed by Jeff Calhoun,who believes in Jordan and knew he could handle the crazy work load (and of course nobody expectedNewsies to have such an immediate second life).

<p>The good luck doesn't stop there: the very first time Jordan appeared on stage in Rock Of Ages,  director
Todd Graff ( Camp,  a comedy about musical theater summer camp and Bandslam,  the sweet teen
comedy) was sitting in the audience having just written his next feature film. Jordan soon found himself
cast in the key role of Dolly Parton's grandson in the new movie Joyful Noise,  which costars Queen
Latifah and opens in January. (The trailer is at the bottom of the story.)
He's also engaged to fellow Broadway star Ashley Spencer, who just left Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert  to
recover from foot surgery; they're getting married next fall. Spencer was one of two finalists in the talent
competition Grease: You're The One That I Want  -- the other was winner Laura Osnes, who ironically
plays Bonnie Parker in Bonnie & Clyde. Here's Osnes singing one of the show's best numbers -- "How
'Bout A Dance" -- in a short film about the making of the musical's trailer.
It's not all rosy: composer Frank Wildhorn has a patchy record commercially in New York and the New
York Times ran a story asking investors why they would invest in Bonnie & Clyde.  That just makes
Jordan feel like an underdog and ready to stand up for a show he believes in. Just two days beforeopening night, Jordan took the time to sit back in his dressing room and cover his career and thepleasures of performing in this show.
Jordan talks about a childhood without a lot of money, just like the two lead roles he's created. Jordan
says he can identify with the rage of Clyde much more easily than the rallying spirit of Jack, the kid fromNewsies  who leads a strike. An early accident ended his love of athletics and sent Jordan towards
musical theater (a grandmother who ran the local community theater made it inevitable as well.) He
candidly says that being straight can be an advantage when trying to land lead roles (along with those
looks and that tenor voice) but also has taken to his Twitter account  over the past two years to champion
equal rights for gays. Born in Texas (just like Clyde), Jordan is a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan (and doing
great in not one but two fantasy football leagues) and yet an offhand gift of a baseball cap when he was a
kid made Jordan a New York Yankees fan as well. (Take that, Texas Rangers.) If he seems calm andfocused and happy for a guy about to face opening night, that's just the result of being a talented actorwho has seen just about everything going his way so far. Whatever the fate of his first new musical onBroadway, Jordan should be around for years to come.
