<p>FALLOUT by Sara Paretsky
Best-selling novelist Sara Paretsky is way too popular to call her a "writer's writer."  Still, she's been name-
checked by Stieg Larsson in his Lisbeth Salander series and praised by the late, great PD James along with 
many others. Now comes her 19th entry in the V.I. Warshawski series and the enthusiastic blurbs from her compatriots are  pretty breath-taking. Lee Child calls it her best yet, Harlan Coben says if you've never read 
her now is the time to jump in and Karin Slaughter calls this particular novel astonishing and Paretsky one of the all-time greats. Is it possible....  Read More.

<p>THE PHENOMENON by Rick Ankiel and Tim Brown
Has any other sport inspired more great fiction and nonfiction than baseball? Unless there's some massive 
body of great cricketing novels out there, we doubt it. So it's telling that sportscaster Bob Costas praises this real-life tale of a young baseball pitcher who crashes and burns and then rises from the ashes as a major league batter for eleven seasons. He tells his story with veteran sportswriter Tim Brown, revealing a life of private demons, professional jinxes and personal triumphs that will appeal even to readers who don't have a passionate opinion on the DH....

<p>SPOILS by Brian Van Reet
It took about 15 years after the Fall Of Saigon in 1975 for some of the classic works about that tragic war to 
come to light. The nonfiction masterpiece  A Bright Shining Lie  came out in 1988 and Tim O'Brien's masterful 
short story collection  The Things They Carried  arrived in 1990. Right on schedule, we're finding one acclaimed 
work after another about Iraq and Afghanistan hitting shelves. The latest is this acclaimed novel which tells thestory of both sides in the Iraqi occupation, ranging from a 19 year female gunner taken hostage to a long-time mujahedeen who is a little freaked out by the far  more radical mujahedeen showing up now to fight. Time will 
tell where this and other works rank in history, but it's proving a fruitful harvest from a bitter conflict.... Read More. Love Fiction? We've Got 26 More Books Waiting To Be Browsed! Love Current Events? Stay Informed

<p>KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON by David Grann
It's a good week for writer David Grann. His bestseller The Lost City Of Z  has been turned into an acclaimed 
film. Now here comes his latest work of nonfiction, which uses the Osage designation of "the flower-killing 
moon" as a metaphor for a terrible time in the history of that Native American nation. It began in the 1920s when the Osage tribe (or "People Of The Middle Waters") suddenly became rich beyond all imagination thanks
 
to oil. But the white man was not going to let this wealth stand. Soon, a series of vicious and coldblooded murders by gunshot or poison or explosion occurred one after. Finally, the very new government agency dubbed the FBI, under a very young and ambitious J. Edgar Hoover, was asked by an Osage council to investigate. Hoover's people got nowhere until he brought in special agent and former Texas Ranger Tom White, an experienced and honest lawman who looked like the hero in a movie serial. He used new methods of annotating and cross referencing of facts and even brought in an American Indian detective who could get people to talk, an unconventional idea for the time. White saw a pattern quickly emerge.... Read More. Love

<p>WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE THEY ARE by Annabelle Gurwitch  
The author of the best-selling I See You Made An Effort  returns with a new memoir/humorous essays/sketches 
of her impressively dysfunctional family. Like, really dysfunctional. Like, am I adopted dysfunctional. Like, yeah  
it's cool to have bootleggers and a brothel madam in your family's history but not so cool when those 
shysters and con artists are currently alive and asking to borrow money.... Read More.

<p>WHEN THE WORLD STOPPED TO LISTEN by Stuart Isakoff
In 1958, pianist Van Cliburn electrified the world by going behind the Iron Curtain and triumphing at a piano 
competition. Since shady scoring still happens today at international sporting events, you can imagine how unlikely that was at the height of the Cold War. Writer Stuart Isacoff -- the founder of the magazine Piano Today  -- tells the story here, covering Van Cliburn's unlikely artistic career and the repercussions of that event.
 
The story he presents is interesting and surely as thorough as we're likely to get. Isacoff is on firm ground when detailing the state of cultural exchange between the Soviet Union and the West in the 1950s and beyond. He is on less firm ground when detailing Cliburn's eccentric private life, surely in great part because the late Cliburn was not terribly forthcoming given the world he grew up in.  Still, Cliburn may have been a 
sentimentalist, but his story needs someone less willing to overlook the sadder, more tragic moments.... Read More.

<p>ALL DAY by Liza Jessie Peterson 
When you're making a list of the toughest jobs in the world, surely one of the most demanding and rewarding 
would be walking into a classroom of ninth graders  and trying to keep their attention on math and science and  
history. Now imagine doing that with a class room of all boys...on Rikers Island. Poet and actress Peterson didjust that for one year, capturing both the tragedy of mass incarceration for juveniles, the frustration of being able to reach some of the young men enrolled in a class to get their GEDs and the triumph of watching as a precious few triumph. It has a wide scope but never loses focus on the boys she works with in all their complexity. Dangerous Minds it isn't but one can easily imagine Hollywood to come calling. Since Rikers Island is being shut down for good, they'll have an authentic location available right away.... Read More.
