THE ANARCHIST  * out of ****
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS  ** out of ****
David Mamet is a major playwright so distinctive that his name became an adjective. He's also a very good filmmaker. (I
especially enjoy his atypical charmer Things Change,  the under-appreciated Homicide  and that marvelous remake of The
Winslow Boy.)  So he will survive this unpleasant week in which his new play The Anarchist  opened to indifference and
immediately posted a closing notice for December 16 while two doors down a revival of his major work Glengarry Glen Rossfinally opened with a starry cast and less starry reviews. It can't be much fun right now to be Mamet but presumably he'll cursein a rat-a-tat style and get on with his other projects, like a TV movie about Phil Spector he's written and directed with none
other than Al Pacino. If they get nominated for Emmy Awards a year from now, they will surely laugh about this downer of a
week.
THE ANARCHIST  * out of ****
GOLDEN THEATREFirst let's deal with The Anarchist,  a one-act play that runs a long 65 minutes. A prisoner (Patti Lupone) was apparently some
sort of Weather Underground anarchist who cold-bloodedly shot a cop some time in the heady 1970s when robbing banks or
other crimes seemed like a clever way to create social change. Now she's up for parole -- again -- and apparently the judgeand jury boils down to Debra Winger, who has Lupone's fate in her hands. Lupone insists she has found Jesus and isrehabilitated. Winger is unconvinced and wants some remorse or even better the whereabouts of one of Lupone's accomplices.(Though why Winger would think Lupone would know this 30 years after the fact is beyond me, although Lupone was writing aletter to said fugitive.)
It's a battle of wills, or should be, in this two-hander. The set is starkly simple, with a table, two chairs and what looks like a
space heater on the far end of one table. Some filing cabinets are in the back and a weird combination of filing cabinets aretoward the front, with one drawer stacked next to two drawers, providing a convenient perch for sitting or rabble rousing on the
otherwise fine set by Patrizia Von Brandenstein (who also did the costumes).
I'm all for a battle of two fiery personalities. Is Lupone repentant? Can Winger (and presumably the audience) forgive her
hateful actions after 30 years? When this doesn't prove terribly involving, I was perfectly happy to have Mamet use these twowomen as an excuse to debate questions of faith and redemption, morality, the passage of time and something, anything thatmight hold my attention.
No luck. At 65 minutes my guest slumbered briefly (I understood) and then woke up just in time for the minor twist that hardly
puts what we've witnessed in a new light or even deserves the dreaded spoiler alert. Don't anticipate a revelation and you won'tbe disappointed. Mind you, don't anticipate much of anything and you won't be disappointed either.
Lupone is a Mamet veteran but unlike Ricky Jay she's no master of sleight of hand and can't conjure up drama where none
occurs. Winger of course has far less theatrical experience but I won't judge Winger's stagecraft on her work here. She's asturdy presence and if she doesn't really register or convince, neither does the show.
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS  ** out of ****
GERALD SCHOENFELD THEATRE
With The Anarchist  sadly behind me, the very next day I headed to Glengarry Glen Ross.  The shows stand on either side of
Once , the musical that was a favorite of mine from last season. One can imagine its essentially hopeful outlook for the future
fighting off the grim shadows of the plays around it. I'd never seen Glengarry  on stage so this was a chance to see Mamet's
tale of sleazy salesmen fighting and clawing their way over the bodies of the salesmen they'd left behind while hoping for the
American dream, or at least a Cadillac for the salesman of the month.
It's a dream cast, with Al Pacino as Shelly, the loser who once was king of the hill but now has to beg the office manager
(David Harbour) for some decent leads. Bobby Cannavale is Richard Roma, the new cock of the walk with a name so flashyyou just know he could sell used cars without tires and then get you to buy the tires as well. John C. McGinley of Scrubs  is the
loud-mouthed braggart who is browbeating sad sack Richard Schiff of The West Wing  so Schiff will break into the office
overnight and steal some leads. Jeremy Shamos (so good in Clybourne Park ) is a mark whose wife insists he back out of a
deal made with Roma. But nobody backs out of a deal with Roma; a sale is a sale even if the law says schmucks like Shamoscan change their mind within three days.April 30, 2014

<p>It's a pleasure to list all the actors, talented performers one and all. What could go wrong with that cast and this play? A lot
apparently.
Act One is simplicity itself. We're in a dingy Chinese restaurant with two booths side by side perched on the edge of the stage,
almost in the audience's lap. (The scenic design by Eugene Lee is at its best here.) That intimacy is a good thing since Pacinois not in carnival barker mode. He's a desperate, beaten down, pleading man here in the first scene, quietly cajoling andwhining and needling the office manager for what he needs. No fireworks here, but Pacino does score some nice momentswith gentle hand gestures and quiet demurrals that show a man down to his last chance and trying to tamp down the animosityand anxiousness he feels.
Quiet is not usually the word that springs to mind when thinking of the garrulous, nonstop talking of Glengarry  and the
problems this approach engenders begin to pile up. In the second scene, McGinley is bullying Schiff but the idiotic logic he
uses (Schiff must rob the office because if he doesn't McGinley will do it and say Schiff helped him) falls apart when we get a
chance to catch our breath. Even less effective is the third scene, where Cannavale is in one booth and Shamos is in another.
Cannavale is more outgoing and voluble than the others (he's on top, after all) but still his spiel towards an unsuspecting dinerfeels more creepy than hypnotic. You expect Shamos to tell Cannavale to shut up ("I'm eating here!") not get drawn in.
The second act takes place the next day in the aftermath of the burglary, with a cop (Murphy Guyer) grilling each employee
one by one. The tension -- Who actually robbed the place and will they get caught? Can Roma put off the mark until thedeadline passes? Who gets the Cadillac? - is almost nonexistent. Director Daniel Sullivan has done much better work before
and will do so again but here the drama is drained away quietly and perceptibly. Everyone has a moment or two. The play is
too inherently good and the actors too talented to avoid a complete miss. Pacino is nicely deflated at the end, like a balloonwhose helium has been slowly leaking out until it droops toward the ground. But we should be on the edge of our seats fromthe first moment, not sitting back and wondering who would be so foolish as to buy anything from any one of them.
