Fool’s Assassin

From the Publisher: NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER
Nearly twenty years ago, Robin Hobb burst upon the fantasy scene with
the first of her acclaimed Farseer novels, Assassin’s Apprentice,  which
introduced the characters of FitzChivalry Farseer and his uncanny friendthe Fool. A watershed moment in modern fantasy, this novel—and those
that followed—broke exciting new ground in a beloved genre. Together
with George R. R. Martin, Robin Hobb helped pave the way for suchtalented new voices as Scott Lynch, Brandon Sanderson, and Naomi Novik. Over the years, Hobb’s imagination has soared throughout the mythic lands
of the Six Duchies in such bestselling series as the Liveship Traders Trilogy
and the Rain Wilds Chronicles. But no matter how far she roamed, herheart always remained with Fitz. And now, at last, she has come home,with an astonishing new novel…

What We Say
In the beginning of a new fantasy trilogy, writer Robin Hobb returns to her most popular characters: Fitz and the
Fool. Quite triumphantly so, I'd say. You needn't read everything she's done before to enjoy this tale, thoughclearly fans of the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies will be the first to line up. Here we find Fitz, a once andfuture assassin, living a quiet life. Hobb very confidently keeps a calm quiet pace for the first half of the book,

<p>letting us sink into this world and appreciate the life Fitz has (the more to ache when it is threatened, of
course). I found it thoroughly compelling. HIs wife insists that at her very advanced age that she's pregnant. Fitzis almost worried for her mental health but humors her nonetheless...and then a child is born. Hobb really kicks
into high gear for me not when the action comes tumbling out (as it does by the climax) but by switching the
point of view from Fitz to the child, a truly fascinating character worthy of taking her place alongside Fitz and
the Fool. Surely those who know Hobb's work best will be the most moved by the various plots that have led to
this moment in the lives of these characters. But it's a rich, complex story…
