The Hirschfeld Century
Edited with text by David Leopold($40, Knopf )
BOOKFILTER’S BEST OF SUMMER PICKS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | JULY 21, 2015
SHARE</p>
<p>When you think about Broadway, images pop into your head: neon
signs, classic shows, iconic posters, and the stars. But you don’talways picture Carol Channing and Tommy Tune in the flesh, do you?Sometimes you picture the vivid caricatures that capture thosepersonalities even better than the people themselves. And thosecanny, amusing, and memorable portraits were created by Al Hirschfeld. If you’ve already seenthe documentary about his life, here’s the next best thing to a Hirschfeld museum. It’s a lavishart book celebrating Hirschfeld’s craft that naturally bursts at the seams with examples of those
works that define him — and indeed the American theater. Learn more.
The Downtown Anthology 
Edited by Morgan Gould & Erin Salvi($19.99, Playscripts)
Sometimes downtown is uptown. At least artistically, the real heat
often comes from Off-Broadway and even Off-Off-Broadway. Thoseare the playwrights who will revolutionize theater, bringing theirinnovative work to Broadway or simply shaking it up with productionsaround the country. It’s impossible to argue with the six hits exploredin this book, drawn from the wellspring that is downtown theater. Hitsin this case doesn’t always refer to box office: It refers to hitting yourmark, creating a work that will endure. Among the plays included:Trevor  by Nick Jones, The Lily’s Revenge  by Taylor Mac, and We Are
Proud to Present . . . by Jackie Sibblies Drury. Learn more.
 
All Together Now 
By Gill Hornby($26, Little, Brown And Company)</p>
<p>Go to see a Broadway show and you can’t help but fantasize about
treading the boards yourself. That might mean acting in a localproduction of The Importance of Being Earnest . Or maybe just singing
in a choir. Creating art together is what it’s all about. In this charmingnovel, Hornby captures the magic of people coming together in song.When your town is on the ropes, the first thought that springs to mindprobably isn’t “show choir.” But a shot at a major competition is aboutall the citizens can look forward to — assuming the stalwart choirmembers can get along with much-needed new recruits brought in tobeef up their sound. Buzzed about with early strong reviews, it’s a crowd-pleaser that someonelike producer Scott Rudin has probably already optioned for the movies and  for Broadway.

Madeline Kahn: Being the Music, a Life 
By William V. Madison($35, University Press of Mississippi)
What a unique talent Madeline Kahn was. The current revival of On
the Twentieth Century  reminds us that Kahn was once a theatrical
force to be reckoned with. But even those unlucky enough to miss heron stage know Kahn was a marvel on film, a fact captured in classicsincluding Paper Moon  and Blazing Saddles . Madison gives us more
than Kahn the kooky public persona: He gives us Kahn the artist andKahn the woman in all her complicated glory. It’s to his credit that somany stars who knew her offered reviews saying how he did right by
this once-in-a-lifetime performer. Learn more.
The Millionaire and the Bard 
By Andrea Mays($27, Simon & Schuster)</p>
<p>William Shakespeare will live forever — but he almost didn’t make it to
the 18th century. Luckily, determined friends risked considerablefunds to create the First Folio, a collection of his plays designed tocelebrate his genius. That rescued many works that might have beenlost forever and proved essential in launching Shakespeare’senduring fame. Author Andrea Mays tells the fascinating tale of howthat First Folio came to be, and the remarkable saga of Henry Folger,who became obsessed with Shakespeare and devoted hisconsiderable fortune to collecting enormous quantities of theatrical material from Shakespeare’stime, including every First Folio he could lay his hands on. Auctions, unexpected deaths,grudges, and more all come into play as Mays charts the siphoning-off of Shakespeare’s workfrom the U.K. to the U.S. and later Japan. Since you won’t get to buy a Folio yourself, buy this
and live vicariously. Learn more.

charming picture book romps through the many sections andinstruments with a verve that Leonard Bernstein would heartily
approve of. Learn more.

By Reynold Levy($28.99, PublicAffairs)</p>
<p>Levy oversaw Lincoln Center for more than a decade, taking it from
the depths of despair to its newly triumphant position as a jewel ofNew York City. Does he deserve all the credit? None of it? Some of it?Judge for yourself as Levy tells all about tackling the arts institutiondespite the warnings of friends that it was a fool’s errand.

Ziegfeld and His Follies
By Cynthia Brideson and Sara Brideson($40, University Press of Kentucky)
Even now, Florenz Ziegfeld captures the popular imagination as the
Broadway producer who broke the mold. He personified the</p>
<p>glamorous 1920s and created a revue whose name still plucks at our
heartstrings. Oh, to have seen a Ziegfeld Folly back in the day!Cynthia Brideson and Sara Brideson tell Ziegfeld’s story, placing himin the context of his times as well as showing the impact he’s had ontheater ever since.

The Big Book of Broadway: The 150 Definitive Plays and Musicals
By Eric Grode($50, Voyageur Press)
Let the arguments begin! Heck, you can even have passionate
arguments about the shows you haven’t seen! Yes, Grode’s coffeetable book is filled with images and bits of trivia that casual fans willenjoy. It has short, sharp takes on dozens of plays and musicals (fromthe 1860s smash The Black Crook  to The Book of Mormon ) that are
unquestionably landmark works, whether commercially or artisticallyor (best of all) both. But is his list your list? It’s certainly not my list and half the fun is tearingdown the ones you think don’t belong and wondering how the heck he left such-and-such off!!
Such-and-such is a masterpiece! Learn more.
Death Ex Machina 
By Gary Corby($26.95, Soho Crime)
Is there anything worse than dying on stage? While actually dying on
stage, for starters. Gary Corby’s popular and acclaimed series ofmysteries set in ancient Greece serves a dual purpose. It offers pretty</p>
<p>accurate glimpses of day-to-day life both in Athens in general and in
the world of the theater in particular. (Machines were an increasinglycentral fact of life, even back then, for example.) And it provides wittilydangerous mysteries. This time, a major festival is nearly disrupted bythe death of an actor, a murder immediately “illustrated” by abackdrop displayed on stage. Our heroes have to pretend to battle spirits while tracking downthe very human mastermind they believe is responsible. It’s silly fun, especially for those who
savor mysteries set in worlds far removed from their own. Learn more.

Edited by William W. Demastes($19.99, Applause Theatre & Cinema Books)
Whether you are looking for a play to perform, want to spot rising
talent, or just enjoy reading well-done pieces, The Best AmericanShort Plays  series is a dependable offering. The theatrical equivalent
of a short story is awfully appealing after tackling another “classic”five-act work that you can’t help thinking might have been just as
good (or better) at three acts. Or two. Learn more.
My First Hundred Years in Show
Business 
By Mary Louise Wilson($28.95, Overlook Press)
Here it is, the dishiest, funniest, chattiest,
and most soul-baring theater book of theyear. Tony winner Mary Louise Wilson —</p>
<p>forever dubbed “the best thing in it” in
review after review — captures her life andcareer in this delightful memoir. Pick it upand its slim nature (less than 200 pages)might disappoint. But then you start to read it and soon realize, Oh, she only put in the goodstuff! Wilson tells her story in a charmingly scattershot style, but the through line is the eight-year journey of turning a memoir of Vogue  editor Diana Vreeland into the career-peak triumph
Full Gallop . Otherwise, she jumps from her crazy family to sharing horror stories about auditions
and life on the set of the hit sitcom One Day at a Time , enduring the glassy stare of Bonnie
Franklin, to winning the Tony for Grey Gardens . It’s impressionistic, flits all around, has no
discernible structure, and pretty much charms the hell out of you. Learn more.
So You Want to Be a Dancer
By Matthew Shaffer($19.95, Taylor Trade Publishing)
Is Matthew Shaffer plugged in? He’s gotten blurbs from
choreographer Mandy Moore of So You Think You Can Dance  and
Emmy-winning director Kenny Ortega, for starters. And while highlysuccessful, the fact that he’s not a superstar legend everyone hasheard of perhaps means that Shaffer is able to keep his feet on theground (insert dance joke here) while offering up actual practicaladvice about everything from auditioning to how to behave on filmsets around the stars. This book is for those who yearn to break in
and those who just want to fantasize about what it’s like to try. Learn more.</p>
<p>Shakespeare and the Countess 
By Chris Laoutaris
($29.95, Pegasus)
No, we have no idea why the formidable historical figure Lady
Elizabeth Russell hasn’t been the star of a play or movie yet, or anovel — until now. She’s a compelling villain/heroine. Infuriated that anew theatre was opening right next to her home, Lady Elizabeth (whostyled herself the Dowager Countess) mounted a furious assaultagainst Shakespeare’s new home, driven by religious passion (shehated Roman Catholics and  the Church of England), her puritan
streak of propriety, and, let’s face it, good old not-in-my-backyard-ism. The result? Shakespeare’s troupe had to abandon the indoor theatre and build another one,dubbing it The Globe. This showdown is presented with verve by historian Chris Laoutaris and
virtually every critic has commented that it’s a tale worthy of Shakespeare’s gifts. Learn more.
Drama Club 
By Marie-Louise Jensen($9.99, ReadZone Books)
Hey, not everything can be life-and-death. So why not savor this teen
romp, a story of kids involved in summer theater where, of course,who likes who and which actors are getting the lead roles in the bigshow really are  matters of life and death for the young protagonists.
It’s a good reminder that theater is a showcase for artists andbudding talent and a creative outlet and all that. But when you’reyoung, it’s also a family. And families fight and make up and fightagain, but they’re family and that’s what matters, especially if kids
don’t always feel like they belong anywhere else. Learn more.
Judy + Liza + Robert + Freddie + David + Sue + Me . . . 
By Stevie Phillips($25.99, St. Martin’s Press)</p>
<p>Sometimes you get the feeling that talent agents are some of the most
vivid characters in the business. Sue Mengers got her due with BetteMidler’s acclaimed one-woman show. Now a compatriot of Mengerstakes the spotlight by telling her own tale. Stevie Phillips got her startcatering to the whims of Judy Garland at the tail end of the legend’scareer. Surviving that was triumph enough, but Phillips insists she alsolearned from Garland and shares an intimate side rarely glimpsed ofthe performer’s performer. Phillips went on to represent Liza Minnelliand Robert Redford, among many other stars, while working onacclaimed theater pieces including Doonesbury  and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas .
Chatty and informal, this is a memoir that insists it ain’t like it used to be. And it ain’t. Learn
more.
