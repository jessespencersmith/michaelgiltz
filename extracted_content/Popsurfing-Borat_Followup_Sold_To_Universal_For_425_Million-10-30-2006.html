Even as Fox scales back the opening weekendscreen total for "Borat" from 2000 to 800 (which is a sign of panic butwill I think be better for the movie long-term), comic Sacha BaronCohen has sold his next reality film to Universal for $42.5 mil. That onewill star the outrageously gay fashionista Bruno. I think its appeal isless than Borat -- you certainly don't get the automatic frat/Jackassaudience with Brune -- but the price for worldwide rights is still lowenough that it makes sense. That money includes the $20+ mil budget,a good $15 mil to $20 mil guaranteed for Cohen and then 15% of thebackend. Well deserved, but what is Cohen going to do after he's donefeature films for his three main characters? Can he make a sequel onceBorat becomes world-famous? Yes, if Cohen gives up on the "prank"aspect of the films that is increasingly unnecessary and yet still veryfunny.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
