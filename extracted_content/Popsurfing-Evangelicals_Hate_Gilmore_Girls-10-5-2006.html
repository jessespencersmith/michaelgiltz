            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  O C TO B E R  0 5 ,  2 0 0 6Evangelicals Hate "Gilmore Girls?"A story in the NYT talks about the panic (or faked panic) amongevangelical leaders over the loss of teenagers. Their source for thispanic? A 10 year old poll that claims soon only 4% of teens will be"Bible-believing Christians." (Another poll-taker insists that today only5% of teens are "Bible-believing Christians" right now and since thisdepends on how you define "Bible-believing Christians" it may well betrue and indicative of nothing since it doesn't mean teens are flockingto worship Satan, just not necessarily embracing a far-rightfundamentalist vision of Christianity. I find it equally impossible totake seriously a Salon.com editor who insists that "lots" of teens tell herthat in their high school if you're not Christian you're not cool and thatthere's tons of peer-pressure to be Christians. And why is all this on myblog? Because at a huge Acquire The Fire concert, teens listed thevarious temptations they were going to turn their backs on whendevoting themselves to Jesus. Among the temptations? Harry Potter,Louis Vuitton, "my perfect teeth obsession," (get behind me, whiteningstrips!), "Gilmore Girls" and Ryan Seacrest. Ryan Seacrest? "AmericanIdol" is an evil temptation? And the girls of Gilmore, characters on ashow created specifically to re-create family hour? If you think thoseare evil, you better wrap yourself in bubble plastic and just wait for theRapture, because then everything is evil.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
