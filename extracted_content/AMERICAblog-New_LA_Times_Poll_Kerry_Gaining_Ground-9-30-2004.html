9/30/2004 03:34:00 AMA new LA Times poll shows Bush with a 5% lead and says he'sgaining ground among some key independent groups. But it also saysif you look at registered voters (and not just "likely" voters) that thelead is only 4% and that the margin of error is 3%. That means thatthey could be anywhere from 1% to 7% apart.The annoying part? Despite numerous articles in the last day or twoabout polls and serious questions about the mix of voters involved,this poll never mentions its breakdown of voters -- was it 52%Republican and 38 % Dems or 45% of each with 10% independentsin both? Who knows? I looked through the article and the 22 pageattachment that broke down its poll and couldn't find that very basic,arguably crucial breakdown anywhere. Maybe I missed it. If I did, letme know. If I didn't, email the LA Times and ask them why they don'tinclude a breakdown of the people polled by party affiliation and askthem to provide it for this poll and all polls in the future.Let's face it: polling is an inexact science and some of these groupshave developed their own "secret formulas" for decades in an attemptto be accurate and beat out the compeition. That means they're bothleary (sic?) of revealing methodology and are such number geeksthat they've never been questioned before. People just took polls atface value, just like they never questioned their priests or ministerson questions of faith. Those days are over.
