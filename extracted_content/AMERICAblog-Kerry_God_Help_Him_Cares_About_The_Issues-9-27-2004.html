9/27/2004 02:46:00 AMThe Sunday New York Times did a lengthy piece about Kerry andwhat he's like. It describes a man who asks probing, thoughtfulquestions, constantly reaches outside his inner circle for the opinionof others and -- when it comes to the election campaign -- is clearlythe man in charge."Mr. Kerry reads briefing books and newspapers in the morning (oftengrousing about stories critical of him), watches television interviewshows like Charlie Rose's late at night (sometimes leaving phonemessages for his friends who appear as guests, offering critiques oftheir performances) and dials senators and old friends at all hours. Atmeetings, Mr. Kerry poses contrarian questions in an often wanderingquest for data and conflicting opinions, a style that his aides,sometimes with a roll of the eyes, call Socratic."Compare this to their description of Bush:"For better and for worse, Mr. Bush takes his counsel from a small,unchanging group of strategists. His senior campaign staff has notchanged in 18 months. Mr. Bush's hunger for information andconflicting opinions is limited. His management style is crisp andinsular, and it does not change between easy days and tough ones."Here's the kicker: this is supposed to be a weakness of Kerry. Yep,caring about the issues instead of caring about campaigning is bad."Representative Ted Strickland of Ohio said that during a recent bustrip through the small towns of the Appalachian region that make uphis district, Mr. Kerry peppered him with questions about the way thereduction of import tariffs had affected the pottery industry â€” notabout the voting patterns in a state he is struggling to win back fromthe Republicans."It's all because the "Alice in Wonderland" world of the media is morecomfortable reporting on changes in behind-the-scenes campaingpersonnel than on the issues, the facts and where the candidatesstand on them.But reading these two descriptions, who would you rather haverunning the country?
