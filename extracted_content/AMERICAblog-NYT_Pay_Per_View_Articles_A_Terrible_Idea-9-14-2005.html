9/14/2005 01:26:00 AMJohn posted below about the New York Times' decision to startcharging for online access to sections of the paper. Here's mytwo cents.I think the NYT decision to start charging for certain sections ofthe paper is a terrible idea -- and not just because they serve apublic function and it would be noble, blah blah blah. Billions ofdollars are flowing into Internet ads. The New York Times ismaking money off of that. And what's happening online?Literally millions of blogs are DRIVING TRAFFIC to the websitesof the major newspapers. Traffic at the New York Times,Washington Post, LA Times and more must be through the roof.Literally MILLIONS of people are likely to see a NYT articletrumpted by the blogs (or simply accessed by people withinternet access overseas) than ever before in history.The NYT -- without any effort on its part -- is gaining a massivenew audience, a ton of eyeballs either going to or being urgedto go to its website. If they can't make money off of that, theydon't deserve to stay in business. And erecting a wall to keepout all the people you could be exposing to ads and makingmoney off of is just stupid. It makes sense for the Wall StreetJournal and its very select, wealthy readership. It makesabsolutely no sense for a mainstream newspaper like the NYT.The notice also mentioned they'll be making their ENTIREARCHIVE available...to people who subscribe. Again, oldarticles are gathering dust on library shelves and anyone cancheck them out for free. Now the NYT can cleverly leveragethat remarkable database and GET MORE READERS to come toits website and make money off that increased traffic via webads. They make virtually NOTHING off those articles that aredecades old but imagine how often they could link to themfrom current articles or simply make them available and watchbloggers and students and the curious explore that databaseand get exposed to ads again and again and again. Howshortsighted and stupid can the Grey Lady be? Very stupid,apparently.
