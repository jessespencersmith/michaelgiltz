7/28/2005 08:45:00 PMA sad story in the LA Times links a National Guard companyfrom that state to some potentially criminal activity.Members of three of four active companies in the battalionare being investigated for their alleged role in mistreatingIraqi prisoners and engaging in inappropriate financialagreements with local shopkeepers, according to militaryofficials.The most egregious case of detainee abuse reported so faroccurred after a June insurgent attack, when soldiersallegedly tortured Iraqi detainees with an electric stun gun.At least one instance of abuse was recorded on video,military sources said.As many as 17 soldiers are under investigation formistreatment of Iraqi prisoners and at least six others havebeen charged with dereliction of duty. Lt. Col. Patrick Frey,the battalion commander, has been suspended pending theinvestigation.Imagine that: suspending someone from duty while they're under thecloud of a serious investigation.Now, every soldier is responsible for their own actions and should beheld accountable. But I also blame Bush for repeatedly making clearthat insurgents and terrorists don't deserve the same basic dignity as"real" people. Bush is the one who has rewarded virtually every topofficial connected with the prisoner abuse scandals. How can hepretend that he also disapproves of torture?But what really struck me about this story was the infamous WolfBrigade, an Iraqi unit that worked with that California Guard unit.The [Wolf] brigade is both loved and feared in Iraq for itsattacks on alleged insurgent hide-outs and the dramatictelevised confessions those offensives produced.But Sunni human rights advocates charged that the brigadeelicited the confessions by beating their captives. A womaninterviewed by The Times this year said brigade officerswhipped her sister with telephone wires to force her toconfess to terrorist acts and to accuse her male associatesof raping her and of having homosexual relations.The detainee, Khalida Mashhandani, was later releasedafter it was determined that her confessions had beencoerced.Despite its controversial reputation, the Wolf Brigadeis regarded by U.S. military officials as the goldstandard for Iraqi security forces.
