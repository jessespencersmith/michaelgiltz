Entertainment News
One of the big discoveries of the festival was
Xavier Dolan, the 20 year old writer, director and
star of I Killed My Mother. The film won three
major awards at the Directors Fortnight and isalready guaranteed to be playing at the Toronto
Film Festival and -- if the rumours are true -- will
probably be invited to the New York Film Festivalas well before opening commercially. I've got afull length profile of Dolan that should run on
The Advocate website  in the next few days. Come
back here to find a direct link when it goes up or
just keep checking out The Advocate's website.
Until then, here's a clip for cineastes with the Montreal-based Dolan talking about the visual stylehe used in his very funny but brutal debut. We were chatting at the private beach of the Majestic
Hotel in Cannes, so the sound in the background is the crashing surf. Ce qui charme!
