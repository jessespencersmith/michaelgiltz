11/02/2004 01:40:00 AMI'm a registered Republican, though by now I guess I'dconsider myself an Independent -- conservative on fiscal andforeign policy issues and what's considered liberal on socialissues. I voted for Reagan and Bush Sr. (I actually really likedhim and thought he was a great VP and good P but twelveyears in power for the same group of folks was long enough)and Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton again. I was batting athousand, actually, until Bush Jr. came along. I really didn'tthink much of Gore but couldn't possibly imagine Bush in theWhite House. I vote swapped with a friend in Florida and --much to my amazement -- found myself voting for Nader inNYC where it was safe and wouldn't do any damage. For a fewdays, my friend and I thought maybe our vote had put Goreover the top and my gosh it almost did. But Bush becamePresident.And he has been far worse than I could ever imagine. As afiscal conservative, I've been aghast at his reckless, wastefulspending, not to mention his squandering of an annual surplus.As an internationalist, I've been distraught to see Bush teardown the hard work of his father and disparage not just the UNbut virtually every international organization and treaty the USis party to. As a respecter of law and order, I'm shocked thathe would consider himself above both US and international law.As someone who is fond of oxygen, I've been choked up overhis environmental record. As a social moderate, I'm furiousthat he has attacked the basic civil rights of Americans. As aRepublican, I'm even more furious that he would toy with theConstitution of the United States for partisan advantage,turning a document that has always been a symbol of freedominto a symbol of division and hatred. As a believer indemocratic capitalism, I've been in disbelief as Bush pretendsto support democracy but continues to cozy up to corruptmonarchies in Saudi Arabia and military dictatorships inPakistan and burgeoning empires in the Soviet Union -- I meanRussia -- while mocking and turning away from our historicallies and real democracies like France and Germany andCanada and Mexico and Brazil and so many others. As anAmerican, I've been aghast that so many of my fellow citizensaccepted Bush's decision to throw US citizens into a hole in theground and claim he should never, ever have to justify toanyone anywhere and certainly not to a judge who he washolding or why. All in the name of freedom. As a human, I'vebeen ashamed to see our nation directly responsible for therape, torture, and killing of prisoners. All in the name offreedom. And not one person was fired or demoted or evenreprimanded except the lowly soldiers caught on videotape andin photos.But happily, my anyone-but-Bush attitude has turned intopositive support for Kerry. He has a very good record on beinga fiscal moderate that I find deeply encouraging. He isintelligent and thoughtful and strong. He representsMassachusetts, so naturally his voting record is liberal. But Ibelieve as President he will lead from the center (despite thebroad mandate he will receive :)) and do a sterling job. I hopehe will announce a Manhattan Project to dramatically lower orend our dependence on foreign oil and develop the alternative
