7/11/2005 04:00:00 AMQuick, someone tell Bush we're at war. It's been almost fouryears since 9-11 and Bush has failed repeatedly to take theobvious, common sense steps needed to improve security hereat home.We posted a few days ago on the Coast Guard, which isresponsible for guarding our coastlines and protecting our ports-- two areas the 9-11 Commission have singled out asespecially vulnerable. It is dramatically underfunded, withaging vessels, most of whch have been around for more thanthree decades. Bush looked at old plans made BEFORE 9-11,plans to upgrade the Coast Guard by 2025...and decided todelay them even further to 2030. That's mind-boggling.But that's just one of many, many areas where any reasonableperson can see Bush has utterly failed to protect and defendAmerica.Another area? His abuse of the National Guard and ArmyReserve. Even its own military leaders have described thoseareas as "broken," thanks to Bush's abuse of those troops witha back-door draft. Here's the latest report, a front page NewYork Times story that highlights the dramatic decline inavailable Guard and Reserve forces that are going to beavailable for overseas duty soon. It also points out that manystates have half their forces and vital equipment likehelicopters in Iraq when they're desperately needed here athome for their traditional roles of providing public safety inemergencies like Hurricane Dennis and the forest fires thatrage annually (that season for fires is about to begin).That rumour about the British and US planning to pull manytroops out in 2006? This story makes clear it might very wellhappen for the simple reason that WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE. Weare running out of troops.
