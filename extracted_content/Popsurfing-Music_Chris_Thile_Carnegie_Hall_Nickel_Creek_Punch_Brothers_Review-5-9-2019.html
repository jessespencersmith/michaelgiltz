MUSIC: CHRIS THILE CAPS CARNEGIE HALL
RESIDENCY WITH OLD FRIENDS
NICKEL  CREEK/PUNCH  BROTHERS  *** 1/2 out of ****
CARNEGIE  HALL  
Did musician Chris Thile  just conquer New York? I think he did! The
multi-talented, mandolin-brandishing entertainer capped off a
residency at Carnegie Hall with a delightful concert celebrating his twokey bands: Nickel Creek, the bluegrass rabble rousers (but with
respect!) that started it all for him and Punch Brothers, the ongoing
group helping Thile to push boundaries of that genre ever further.(Thile won Grammys with both of them, including just this February.)The sold-out crowd was both enthusiastic and attentive, a rare andwelcome attribute. The music was accomplished, lovely, lively and
naturally climaxed with both groups merging on stage for a raucous
hoedown and a final bow.
As if all this weren't enough, Thile just announced that in the future
his radio show will record all its episodes in New York City. Yes, Live
From  Here  -- the Show Formerly Known As A  Prairie  Home
Companion  -- that mainstay of public radio and a bastion of heartland
humor, will be broadcast from the Big Apple. And with Live  From
Here  already test-driven live from Town Hall featuring guests like jazz
singer Cécile McLorin Salvant and Jeff Daniels doing a monologue
from the Broadway show To  Kill  A  Mockingbird,  Thile makes this
transition seem natural and unforced. Longtime fans can rest assured
the show is still sponsored by Powdermilk Biscuits while newcomerswill discover a sharper, more encompassing mix of humor and music.
If you don't know Thile, you've got a lot of catching up to do. He began
performing as a pre-teen (and even guested on A  Prairie  HomeCompanion  at just 15 years old). Nickel Creek has six studio album
and Punch Brothers have five. But wait! Thile also has seven soloalbums AND seven collaborative albums, including two especially
good ones with respectively Edgar Meyer and Brad Mehldau.   (You canMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: 'BLKS' IS</p>
<p>start right now with this 20m set by Nickel Creek for NPR's Tiny Desk
concert series.)
The audience at Carnegie Hall clearly had no catching up to do. Theybegan applauding songs the moment a particular beat or familiarmelody was introduced. They shouted "Ahoy!" and "Oh boy!" at theright times. And generally they held off on applause until the sound of
a song faded mostly away, though one man up front couldn't quite help
himself and offered up a quiet but fervent "Yes!" just as one gorgeoustune ended in otherwise perfect silence.   The night began with the
slightly more intellectual endeavor Punch Brothers, with songs that
often contained distinct movements along with dynamics more often
found in rock. After about 80m and a break, the somewhat moretraditional Nickel Creek delivered fan favorites audiences have beencherishing for the past 20 years. The concert could happily have runtwice as long.
The Punch Brothers set showed off their versatility, from "Julep" to
the marvelous and haunting "Another World" from the EP Ahoy . The
Nickel Creek set was even better, especially since fans haven't seenthem in concert as much in recent years. Sara Watkins delivered
especially piercing versions of "Anthony" and Bob Dylan's "Tomorrow
Is A Long Time." Sean Watkins (her brother) offered an amusing introto his own "21st of May." And Thile was sometimes a showman(making like Joe Cocker on one especially rocking mandolin solo),  
sometimes immersed in the group of musicians at hand and
sometimes sitting back and taking it all in with delight. His voice
weaved in and out of the evening with its high lonesome sound, fromNickel Creek's 2001 debut album heartbreaker "The Lighthouse's Tale"right up to his most recent work with PB.
Time and again, the artists on stage crowded around one mike,
shoulder to shoulder, making music. They did it just like the Weaversdid at Carnegie Hall nearly 65 years ago...and just like Thile will surelybe doing at Carnegie Hall for decades to come.SERIOUSLY FUNNY
