            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  O C TO B E R  2 5 ,  2 0 0 6"Friday Night Lights" Vs. "Studio 60"My friend Sam wondered why I insisted "Studio 60 on the SunsetStrip" was a disaster and likely to be canceled by the end of the season.Why wouldn't they show some patience with it? As I've said before,networks have always killed some shows immediately and showntremendous patience with others -- it's been that way since thebeginning of TV. That patience doesn't always pay off, of course. Butwhy do some shows get a second chance? Usually there's SOMETHINGthey can point to as encouraging in the ratings. "Studio 60" hasdropped every week since its premiere. It's squandering a terrificlead-in: "Heroes," a growing hit at 9 p.m. that should attract the sameliterate, young demographic "Studio 60" wants. Even worse,"S60OTSS" loses more viewers in the second half hour. (In otherwords, even the people that tune in are getting bored before the show isover.) In comparison, look at "Friday Night Lights," the show that isgoing to take over "Studio 60" in a (probably pointless) one night stuntnext Monday night at 10 p.m. It airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. and has to be aself-starter opposite ABC's smash hit "Dancing With The Stars," (the#2 rated show last week) the older skewing CBS drama "NCIS" (ranked#14 last week among all shows), the CW's female hit "Gilmore Girls"and in the spring "American Idol."FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTSWeek #1 -- 7.18 million viewersWeek #2 -- 6.28 million viewersWeek #3 -- 6.61 million viewersWeek #4 -- 6.33 million viewersNow compare that to Studio 60, which debuted earlier.STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIPWeek #1 -- 13.41 million viewersWeek #2 -- 11.21 million viewersWeek #3 -- 9.05 million viewersWeek #4 -- 8.76 million viewersWeek #5 -- 7.76 million viewersNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
