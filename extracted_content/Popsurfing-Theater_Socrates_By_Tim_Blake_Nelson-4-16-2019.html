THEATER: QUESTIONING "SOCRATES"
SOCRATES  ** out of ****
PUBLIC  THEATER
I felt nervous at the start of the new play by actor Tim Blake Nelson.
Not because it's a three hour drama about the philosopher   Socrates.
Heck, plays tackling big ideas -- plays like Arcadia  and Copenhagen
and New  Jerusalem  and Isaac's  Eye  -- are my idea of a feast. I wasn't
nervous   even though, for some reason, the outfits of ancient Greece
and Rome distract me as "costumes" in ways that clothes from other
eras simply don't.
No, I was nervous because after an awkward and unnecessary framing
device, the play begins with a raucous party. Everyone is laughing
uproariously and quite drunk and you desperately want to catch up
and share their mirth. But it just isn't happening, even as Socrates islovingly roasted at length by the handsomest and most popular figurein all of Athens. Pair that with Plato's bland assurance that we're about
to visit "a world more full of wit, passion and above all ideas than
anything you ever imagined possible" and your heart sinks.
That framing device is a hoary one. The great Socrates (Michael
Stuhlbarg) has been executed for corrupting the youth of Athens andmore to the point offending its high and mighty. Nonetheless, a Boy
(Niall Cunningham) has shown up on the doorstep of Plato (Teagle F.
Bougere) and in a rather sullen mood demands to be educated. Platotells the Boy what everyone wants to know. How could this happen?How could the greatest mind of his age be murdered by the proudestdemocracy in the world, a society that values the free exchange of
ideas? And how could the friends of Socrates -- Plato very much
among them -- allow it to happen?   
What follows is precisely what one would expect. In this static and un-
involving drama, Socrates wanders the city of Athens, probing and
asking questions of one and all. He has a devoted band of followersMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>like the quiet and observant Plato, along with an entourage of young
men who love learning how to question authority...and thus drive their
parents nuts. Socrates begins gently and playfully, but most argumentsend with him piercing the intellectual armor of one and all.
That's fine when dealing with friends eager to debate weighty ideas.
It's not so fine when Socrates mocks a well-connected poet orquestions the very pillars of democracy in a way that the powerful seeas traitorous. Socrates makes so many enemies -- notably by opposing
the wholesale execution of military generals who failed in combat --
that he himself goes on trial. The charges are voluminous andcontradictory. Socrates is condemned both for atheism and forworshipping false gods, for example. Yet, his self-absorbed code ofethics is so stringent that Socrates is unwilling to save himself or
simply leave. Death seems inevitable.
Well, of course death is inevitable since -- spoiler alert! -- Socrates
drinks the hemlock and dies. That knowledge is no barrier to a goodplay. But  Tim Blake Nelson hasn't begun to dramatize the action.
Director Doug Hughes and the fine cast do their best, led nobly by the
always intelligent Stuhlbarg, but it never comes close to catching fire.
The biggest problem is that Socrates has no one to challenge him,
emotionally or intellectually. His enemies are cardboard villains
spitting out their hatred or so vain they don't even realize they're fools.
One never doubts for a second his rightness. On the other hand,Socrates clearly allows himself to be executed. A better play mighthave taken him to task for possible vanity, for wanting a death to raisehim to martyrdom. It's not ethics that doom this Socrates; it's ego.
Plato is the most devoted of disciples, but it's a silent form of worship,
leaving a black hole of emotion where our narrator should be. And he'stalking to a cipher when it comes to his pupil. At one point Plato saysthe Boy reminds him of Socrates. Really? That character has said
virtually nothing, so how in god's name could the kid remind him of
the greatest philosopher alive? Worse, the Boy responds that heTHEATER: "INK" STAINED

<p>thought the same thing.
In an attempt to create some drama at the last moment, when
execution looms the wife and a son of Socrates show up. They beg him
to leave Athens and save his life. Their sense of abandonment mightactually matter if they were characters throughout the play, ratherthan popping in at the end. (The wife also appears earlier for a brief
scene.) How can we be upset about the son feeling his father doesn't
love him when their goodbye is the first time we see the lad?
Bougere has a thankless role in Plato, but Robert Joy has the livelier,
more human part of Crito. The rest fade into the background or have
one-note parts they can do little with. That leaves Stuhlbarg, who
brings his formidable talent to the part of Socrates and does what hecan. While the story is inert emotionally, Stuhlbarg provides thenecessary intellect and wit to this shambling questioner. Still, one feelshim pushing for drama that simply isn't there when a handful ofdebates end with Socrates suddenly barking in rage.
Yet one scene works very well indeed. Socrates questions everyone and
one day that practice takes him to a smithy who makes armor andweapons. Socrates peers intently as the man works a forge, askingquestions. This leads to the idea of war and whether "right" wins or
whether the victor simply decides they were right. The smithy (a good
Lee Wilkof)   is a bit out of his element and doesn't like it one bit. Is
Socrates questioning the greatness of Athens, the shining light ofdemocracy?
His rising temper doesn't deter Socrates, who probes and prods the
man some more. Then the man says his own son died in battle. Eventhat  can't stop Socrates. "But does that mean the Assembly is always
right? Including sending your only son into battle? And am I right to
take it therefore that it was right and just and good that your son was
killed?" The man knocks Socrates down and starts beating himsavagely and if Socrates felt   he deserved   it, we wouldn't be surprised.  
For a   moment, we see a man in search of truth, a man who will
question anything and everything and put himself into grave danger,
fully aware of what he's doing, choosing to do it and yet perhaps also  
incapable of not choosing to do it. For a moment, Socrates  and
Socrates both come alive.
