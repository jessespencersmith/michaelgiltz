Showbiz Sandbox 70: Digital or Bust -- The Future of Reading
September 5, 2010
It seems a new electronic reading device is released every week. So it's no wonder that soon the sales of
e-books have begun to outpace traditional print copies. Ryan Chapman, the online marketing managerfor publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux, talks about how the industry is dealing with the new technologyand, in certain instances, using it to their advantage. Example number one? FSG's Work In Progress
blog/video website.
Print editions are no longer a choice for Josh Jackson, the editor-in-chief of Paste Magazine . He
discusses the recent decision to suspend print publication of the indie pop culture magazine. You can still
find its great website online,  of course.

<p>In the television world, no one is shocked that the latest cast of Dancing with the Stars  includes the likes
of Bristol Plain, the daughter of former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Maybe her participation
will cause politicos to rent a few episodes on their new Apple TV.
During our Big Deal or Big Whoop segment we discuss the week's top entertainment news including the
name for Conan O'Brien's new late night talk show, a Billy Joel episode of Glee  and having to choose
between James MacAvoy and Tom Cruise.
