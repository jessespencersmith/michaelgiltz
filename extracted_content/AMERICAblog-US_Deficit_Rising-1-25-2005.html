1/25/2005 09:40:00 PMTension is growing around the world over the ballooning budgetdeficits and the weakening dollar. Europeans say they'rebearing too much of the cost of Bush's profligate ways, no onethinks he's up to the task of tackling the deficit, and analystscompare our economy to the tepid Japanese economy of the90s that went into a tailspin and lengthy recession.Even China is chiding Bush. "The prime minister complainedabout the fall of the dollar, asking, 'Shouldn't the relevantauthorities be doing something about this?'" according to theNew York Times.In an unrelated article (darned if I can find it) it was noted thateven criminals are abandoning the dollar: in Russia'sblackmarket, the US dollar used to dominate but the euro isgaining on it by leaps and bounds. (This might also be due tothe fact that the euro comes in 500 note currencies that makecarrying larger amounts of cash around that much easier.And as Paul Krugman points out in an aside in a column aboutthe replacement for Alan Greenspan,"The United States is running record budget and trade deficits,and the foreigners we depend on to cover those deficits arelosing faith. According to yesterday's Financial Times, centralbanks around the world have already started shifting intoeuros. If Mr. Greenspan is replaced with someone who lookslike a partisan hack, capital will rush to the exits, the dollar willplunge, and interest rates will soar."Nonsense says Treasury Secretary John W. Snow. He's a deficit"hawk!"Oh wait: The latest NYT headline says:White House Predicts $427 Billion Deficit, Including NewWar CostsIf you've got a floating interest rate on your mortgage, now might bea good time to lock it in.
