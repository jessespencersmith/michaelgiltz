            <p>NN lassic Hollywood war movies of the
N past invariably featured a colorful, if
N stereotypical, assortment of soldiers:
Rs the raw recruit, the grizzled sergeant,
the funny-talking immigrant who loves
America, the toUgh-tawkin' guy from the Bronx
or Brooklyn.
What audiences rarely saw, however,
were characters truly representative of the
Ameriean melting pot. But as historians
have taught us that everyone from blacks to
lndians to gays has fought and died in every
U.S. conflict from the Revolutionary War to lraq,
movies have striven to reflect that in recent
years.
Spike Lee's "Miracle at St. Anna." which
opens Friday and tells the story of black
soldiers fighting in ltaly during World War ll,
is just the latest. Here are five more that show
our fighting men - and women - in all their
diverse glory.
STREAMERS 0983)
Whol been drafted? Gays. As if being sent
off to Vietnam wasn't bad enough, violence
ensues when four young recruits holed up in a
barracks waiting to be deployed find out that
one of them is homosexual.
Should they re-up? Judging by this film,
based on a play by David Rabe, in the 1960s
"Don't ask, don't tell" was the best way tostay alive - against the threat of attacks by
your own side.
WINDTALKERS (2OO2)
Whot been dnfted? Indians. The
United States shoved aside Native Americans
when forming this country. But now it has
the gall to ask Navajos to use their language
as an unbreakable code for military
secrets.
Should they re-up? Private Ben Yahzee
(Adam Beach) and the other Navajos prove vital
to the war effort - and they don't stop lovingtheir country just because their country never
loved them.
GLORY(1989)
Who's beem drafted? Blacks. The South was
so desperate toward the end of the Civil War,
it even put guns in the hands of slaves. The
Northerners did the same - and with almost
as much reluctance. Matthew Broderick and
Oscar winner Denzel Washington bring this tale
to light.
Sftonld tlrcy re-up? Black soldiers get to
shoot at slave owners and helo free their
brethren? You have to ask?
G.r. JANE (1997)
Whol been drafted? Women. In this super-
glossy Ridley Scott bit of silliness, Demi Moore
proves that women can be just as physically fit
as men - and twice as hot getting there.Should they re-up? Equal pay for equal work
is a nice change from the outside world, Moore's
buzz-cut Navy SEAL wanna-be, Jordan O'Neil, is
clearly a lifer - Private Benjamin, she ain't.
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN CI998)
YUho's been drafted? Peoole of devout
faith. Sure, there are no atheists in foxholes,
and movies have shown characters like Gary
Cooper's Sgt. York wrestle with the morality
of going to war. But Barry Pepper's Scripture-
quoting sniper in "Ryan" was a revelation.
Should they re-up? God only knows. But if
all people of faith are as good a shot as
Pepper's Pvt. Daniel Jackson, we'd better
nope so. Michael Giltz</p>
