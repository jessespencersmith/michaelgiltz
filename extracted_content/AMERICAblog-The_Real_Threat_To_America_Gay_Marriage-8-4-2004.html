8/04/2004 12:07:00 PMYep, our major cities are being targeted by terrorists, but the realthreat to America is two adults who want to get married. Missouri justamended its state constitution to attack and single out tax-paying,God-fearing citizens they think don't deserve the same basic rights asother people. Sadly, it was passed by an overwhelming majority of70%. Far right groups confidently predict they will win EVERY vote atthe state level in the next few months.
