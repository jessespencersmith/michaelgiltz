You can talk about plot twists and dumb
storylines and internal strife. But I can tell youthe main problem with Grey's Anatomy SeasonFour  ($59.99; ABC Studios) -- that problem is
Private Practice First Season ($39.99; ABCStudios). (That comes out on Tuesday, September16.) It never fails. Someone launches a successfulseries, a show that brings them acclaim and bigratings and will literally make them rich for life.So do they focus on that show and try to make itas good as it can possibly be? Sometimes. Butusually, they get suckered into spin-offs and
launching other shows or movies and instead of one good show, you get two weak ones.Maintaining the quality of a primetime series is a backbreaking job. But doing it for two shows?That's pretty much impossible. I really don't understand why anyone would even try. You becomericher than God if you create a hit primetime show like Grey's Anatomy.  And when it's reached the
end and you want to make something new, people will line up to do business with you. So whyspoil your baby with a bunch of new projects? It's almost worse than what David Milch did whenhe dumped Deadwood  to make the horrible John From Cincinnatti.  I mean, at least he just
stopped Deadwood  rather than let it become a mess. Battlestar: Galactica was easily one of the
best shows on TV, getting better year after year -- until season three. Guess what was occupyingtheir minds? A spin-off set in the past called Caprica  that will in fact begin after this show is over.
CSI: Miami Sixth Season  ($79.99; Paramount) is one of the most popular shows in the world. But
is there anyone who thinks that the unique blockbuster success of the original CSI  hasn't been
diluted by two indistinguishable spin-offs? I mean, how many blood splatters and hair fibres canyou analyze, anyway? If The Wire  had a fifth and final season that wasn't quite the equal of the
brilliant fourth, you might look at the energy its creators put into launching Generation Kill.  TV is
littered with countless other examples of people dropping the ball on a great show because they gotdistracted by the lure of spin-offs and other projects that could give them a media empire. And farrarer is the example of a show like Cheers : a massive hit whose creative team stayed with it to the
end and then -- and only then -- launched a spin-off. Is it any suprise that Frasier  is arguably the

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-happened-to-emg_b_126039.html [4/5/2009 1:32:33 PM]greatest spin-off in TV history?
So tell me, any recent TV shows break your heart by falling apart in quality?
Also out this week:
Cult Classic  -- The reputation of The Big Lebowski  ($19.98; Focus) and the iconic status of the
Dude continue to grow. Has it really only been ten years since this Coen Brothers comedy came
out? It seems like it's been around forever. For $34.98; hardcore fans can get a copy of the DVDhoused in a plastic bowling ball.
Best Reason To Buy A Plasma TV  -- How The West Was Won  ($20.98; Warner Bros.) is out in
a three disc set fully exploiting its eyeball expanding Cinerama. The movie's a bit stolid, with John
Ford's entry clearly the leader in quality, but it's definitely a spectacle. And the bonus docuemntaryon Cinerama is almost as much fun on its own. Seriously, I really need to get a plasma TV.
Comedy's Secret Weapon  -- If you read the comedy issue of Rolling Stone currently on
newsstands, you'll notice one name popping up a few times: Peter Cook. He truly was a seminal
figure on British comedy on par with Monty Python. Check out Peter Cook and Dudley Moore: The
Best Of...What's Left Of...Not Only...But Also... ($24.98; BBC Video), which offers up highlights
from their seminal early sketch series and you'll begin to appreciate his genius.
Once Upon A Time  -- Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre  ($99.98; Koch) was the best -- okay,
the only -- reason to buy Showtime in its early years. Duvall charmed all her friends into appearing
for peanuts and the result was that oft-described phenomenon: a labor of love. How else to explaina top actor like Robin Williams playing the Frog Prince or such quirky casting as Klaus Kinski (asthe Beast) and Paul Reubens as Pinocchio. This boxed set contains all 26 episodes and more extrasthan the 2005 set, including the retropsective cast party and Duvall's pitch reel. For fans of JimHenson's The Storyteller and anyone who delights in charming, witty family entertainment.
Britcoms  -- Every Saturday night all across America, PBS stations air a block of British sitcoms
and dub them Britcoms. My mom never misses it, even if they are all reruns and she's seen them adozen times over. The lineup changes from town to town and runs from the sophisticated lunacy ofFawlty Towers  to the banality of Are You Being Served?  But there's one constant: class. I don't
mean "classy." I mean "class" as in social status. Is there anywhere in the world more obsessedwith class and social distinctions than England? India has its caste system too, I guess; they're justnot as funny about it. Two amusing Britcoms embody that. Keeping Up Appearances: The FullBouquet ($129.98; BBC Video) has fun with Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced "Bouquet"), who
desperately wants to maintain her non-existent high standing in the community but is cursed withlow-class relatives. You'll find virtually no variation to the formula: Hyacinth wants things to bejust so and her relatives or friends or someone puncture her dreams but she behaves as if she's theQueen of England anyway. It's not great, but it's certainly consistent. Of a higher class in every wayis To The Manor Born  ($79.98; BBC Video), the witty 1979 series in which Audrey fforbes-
Hamilton (the great Penelope Keith) must sell her stately home to a...tradesman (a wholesalefoods magnate, actually) and move into the estate's tiny cottage. Not that this keeps her frominterfering and disapproving at every turn. Sparkling dialogue abounds. And how do they maintainthat class? Three seasons, 20 episodes and then they call it a day. (This set also contains aChristmas special and a 25th anniversary reunion show, radio shows and more. Even more class.)
Horror  -- Child's Play 20th Birthday Edition  ($14.98; MGM) is a suitably playful special edition
of the B movie romp that includes audio commentary from actors, writers, producers...and even
Chucky himself. Fox Horror Classics Vol 2  ($19.98; Fox) and though it only contains 3 more
movies, this set sure ranges far: Chandu The Magician,  a serial remake with Bela Lugosi as the
villain (he would later play the hero); Vincent Price in the gothic tale Dragonwyck  and the offbeat
drama Dr. Renault's Secret . All fairly obscure and hard to find so consider that a comment on
Fox's weak bench when it comes to classic horror or a happy example of half-forgotten moviesgetting a new life thanks to being randomly packaged together. But if you really want a horror film,try Foreign Exchange  ($24.98; Screen Media) a would-be high school romp with sex hungry males
feasting on the super-hot foreign exchange student.
TV on DVD  -- Ugly Betty Second Season ($59.99; ABC Studios) also lost its way during the
show's second season. They let the telenovela take over with wacky storylines and ignored the
heart and soul of the show -- Betty (America Ferrera). More Betty, less bombast! Medium Season 4

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Happened To Grey's Anatomy?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-happened-to-emg_b_126039.html [4/5/2009 1:32:33 PM]($59.98; Paramount) gets a lot of mileage out of Patricia Arquette's Allison Dubois being outed as a
psychic and how that upends her life. Just as long as they don't find out she's a hockey mom. It's
Always Sunny In Philadelphia Season 3  ($39.98; Fox) has 15 snark-filled episodes with Danny
DeVito having a blast in episodes purposefully revolving around tasteless topics like who's been
sleeping with a pre-op transexual...again. Jon & Kate Plus Eight Seasons 1 & 2  ($19.95; Genius) is
a reality series about a couple that had twins and then sextuplets and if that doesn't scare you off
artificial insemination, then nothing will. Wings Seventh Season  ($39.98; Paramount) draws to a
close this modest, but well-cast comedy with Tim Daly and Steven Weber. Yes, the Cheers  folk
launched it, but that original show had been around for seven years and they still stayed day to dayon the important one.
Kids Stuff -- Alvin and the Chipmunks Go The Movies  ($16.99; Paramount) is lazy kid's
programming -- just episodes riffing off movies like Batman and Indiana Jones and even lazier
packaging. This is the latest rehash of some of these episodes and since we're talking about showsthat aired almost 20 years ago, why not include ALL the parodies in one set rather than mixing andmatching them again and again? The Best Of Barney  ($19.98; Lionsgate) collects just 60 minutes
of highlights from the properly maligned children's show. They describe it as "super-dee-duper"and that about says it all. Legion of Super Heroes Vol. 3 ($14.98; Warner Bros.) collects just fiveepisodes from the series, which means you'll have to buy five volumes to get all the shows from thefirst two seasons rather than two volumes with each 13 episode season complete. I'm noticing apattern here. On a happier note, The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries First Season  ($19.98;
Warner Bros.) do indeed contain all 13 episodes from the show's first season. Unfortunately, it ranin 1995, long past the heyday for these characters. Thomas and Friends: The Great Discovery($19.98; Lionsgate) is at least a new feature length film with Pierce Brosnan providing voice-workas the narrator. Back to the bad news: The Spectacular Spider-Man: Attack Of The Lizard($19.94; Sony) tries to con people into buying the first three episodes of the new cartoon series.Just wait for the full-season DVD set or you'll feel as much of a chump as Peter Parker. Finally,Tortoise Vs. Hare  ($19.98; Genius) is a so-so animated film that can't live up to the high Jim
Henson standards even though it's released under that banner. If it seems like a bad week for kid'sstuff, don't forget that Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre  is out.
Blu-Ray  -- Jackie Chan and the not-so-retired Jet Li co-star in The Forbidden Kingdom  ($39.99;
Lionsgate) is just the sort of action title fans want on Blu-Ray, even if it does cost $5 more than theSpecial Edition DVD and $10 more than the standard DVD.  Cool Hand Luke  ($28.99; Warner
Bros.) is not one of those naturals, but what a terrific movie. Paul Newman has rascally charm tospare and maybe knowing a whole bunch of new people are appreciating his work will lift the ailingactor's mood.  The Fall  ($38.96; Sony) proves director Tarsem is the most original visual stylist to
hit Hollywood since Terry Gilliam. Smallville Seventh Season  ($79.98; Warner Bros.) marks the
arrival of Supergirl, which of course means that the show has long ago run its course and theyknow it: the eighth season will probably be its last.
This and that  -- Jason Statham has probably his biggest success yet (when you look at reviews
and box office) with the B movie heist flick The Bank Job  ($29.95; Lionsgate). It's the sort of flick
you Netflix or catch on cable and say, "Hey, that wasn't bad!" Reprise  ($29.99; Miramax) is more
of a genuine find, with two buddies struggling to remain friends (both novelists) as one becomes
famous and the other just continues to struggle. Sarah Palin...I mean Tina Fey stars in themediocre comedy Baby Mama  ($29.98; Universal) -- but what does she care when she's still got
30 Rock?  Heckler  ($19.99; Echo Bridge) is a comedy documentary that couldn't be funny if it tried.
Get off the stage! You suck! My dead grandmother is funnier than you! Actually, it's a prettyamusing look at comedians and how they deal with hecklers, featuring everyone from Jamie
Kennedy to Bill Maher, Lewis Black and Kathy Griffin. We Are Together  ($19.98; Palm) is a
documentary about the kids in an orphanage who find consolation and joy by performing in their
Agape Choir. Look for the heart-tugging feature film any minute now. Less sweet is VH1's Last
Days Of Left Eye  ($19.97; Anchor Bay), which features footage from the last days of TLC singer
Lisa Lopez. And dying won't stop her: she's got a new CD out soon. Finally, there's The Life and
Times of Mr. Perfect  ($29.95; WWE), which contains a 90 minute documentary on the pro
wrestler and 10 complete matches.
So tell me, any recent TV shows break your heart by falling apart in quality?

Sorry but I disagree with Grey's Anatomy. That show fell apart the minute Meredith "died" in the ferryboat crash. Addison McBeal or Private Practice might have been the final bullet but GA was already inthe toilet.

Great comments! JJ Abrams does indeed have a horrible track record. 
How The West Was Won -- very funny. Maybe the subtitles read How The West Was Lost for the
indigenous Americans already living there when "settlers" showed up.
Star Trek -- I know people who can chart the rise and fall of the multiple spin-offs by when ST:TNG
ended and the best writers migrated to DS9 and elsewhere. Lots of lost opportunities and too many
shows at once. 
The Jeffersons is definitely one of the most successful spin-offs of all time and I have a personal

weakness/fondness for Marla Gibbs. Of course, it and Maude and Mike & Gloria and Good Times are a
reason All in the Family fell apart.
Firefly --A very fun show in its own right, but of course it meant the last two seasons of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer (one of my favorite shows of all time) completely sucked. 
BSG -- If you have a fondness for the original (I didn't) then of course it's wackily different. No,
Smallville was never great or even good but it was okay for about a season and a half (roughly seasontwo through mid 3) and those days are long gone. 
The Wire -- The fourth season was so unbelievably brilliant that I don't think the fifth season could do
anything but suffer in comparison. And Generation Kill didn't help. That said, the fifth season wasindeed a very solid finale to a great, great series.

JJ Abrams is now the undisputed ruler of Abandonmyhitshowitruinistan. He dropped his involvement inAlias, one of the best serialized dramas to come along, as he prepped his new hit, Lost. Alias soon fellinto a repetitive cycle of wackier and wackier plot twists, which was disappointing on a show that hadpreviously handled such ideas with seriousness. Then the same thing happened to LOST, as the reinswere handed over to the producing team while JJ Abrams went off to produce and direct MissionImpossible 3. The lure of the movie business was not to be denied. Now he's back with Fringe, which I
expect might have one or two good seasons in it before his involvement drops again (He's reviving the
Star Trek movie franchise, after all) and another one of Abrams' television creations dies a slow death. 
Basically, if a show is being produced or written or directed by JJ Abrams, no matter how intriguing the
concept (a la Fringe), I refuse to even watch it, because it's only setting myself up for disappointment
later.

"How the West Was Won" thrilled me as a child. The music, the raft ride, the thieves in the cave,
Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, and more. I watch it on television occasionally, but itsounds like the modern technology will make it better than the best movie house in town could do in theearly 1960s. 
It's probably politically incorrect now, though. Oh well. I guess the natives would call it How the West
Was Lost.

Star Trek DS9 did the same thing in it's last season. Story lines were all over the place for half of it,then when it finally got focused it missed some great opportunities for new direction. They never reallyexploited Cisco's position as a religious figure. There were a number of directions to go with that.
Another was the show "Girlfriends", which seemed to lose direction after the departure of Jill Marie
Jones as the writers sought to produce a new chemistry rather than have it thought out in advance.Sloppy righting and story lines lost audience.

It's hard for me to find shows that lost there mojo since most of the ones I like get canceled firstseason. FIREFLY is the most egregious of those I felt were top quality and never made it while realitycrud gets the pass all the time.
BUTLOST lost it's quality and when the producers and writers admitted they were making it up WHILE the
show was being filmed, well that shows they really had no idea of what to do. The drop in ratings was
very good proof of this.

I realize this goes against the grain ( and I hope you don't think lesser of me for it) but I hate Battlestar
Craptica. Really I did. It personified the words....Space Opera to a "T".
It SHOULD have been called something else. It had nothing in common with the original BSG. I was
jazzed when they announced it's return even if Ronald (The Cooler) Moore was at the helm. The showwas so easy to pick apart that is was like watching Dick Cheney "hunt" birds.
Smallville? Was it ever great? It was watchable and even the arrival of Supergirl didn't make it any
worse OR better, just sort of.....eh.
Baby Mama? AWFUL.
Left Eye was sad. Sometimes the behind the scenes stories are nowhere near what one might imagine
a star's life to be.
Cartoons? Sorry but nothing matches the originals. Not worth buying the new ones in my purely humble
opinon.

Lost teetered on the edge of completely falling apart (or was it just too many obscure references andeaster eggs that distracted them?...), but I guess that's why last season really got me excited about itagain.
Ditto on Battlestar Galactica, and I think you could say Weeds may have suffered from the same fate.
But I have to disagree with you on the Wire. Fifth season was great, and a fitting end to an ongoingstory.
