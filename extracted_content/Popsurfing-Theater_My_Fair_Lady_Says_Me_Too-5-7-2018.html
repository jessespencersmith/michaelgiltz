THEATER: "MY FAIR LADY" SAYS #METOO!
MY  FAIR  LADY  ** 1/2 out of ****
LINCOLN  CENTER  THEATER
Is My  Fair  Lady  sexist? To anyone with sense, of course it isn't. The
show is based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion  and in both cases
the issue at hand is class, not gender. If anything, one might argue My
Fair  Lady  is snobbish. You'd still be wrong but at least you'd be
fighting the right battle.
Alan Jay Lerner's terrific book and lyrics pair with the sublime music
of Frederick Loewe to tell a story so ingrained in our culture you knowit even if you've never seen the show. The latest presentation of it hasjust opened at Lincoln Center, scored ten Tony nominations and is a
shoe-in to win Best Revival Of A Musical.
In it, Henry Higgins is a distinguished phoneticist eavesdropping on
the talk of lower class workers at Covent Garden. When a fellowenthusiast for languages greets him, Higgins boasts that in six months
he could take even the most untutored peasant and pass her off as a
lady. And then Higgins does it. Brilliant man that he is, Higginsrelentlessly tutors a flower girl named Eliza, sculpting her into awoman of impeccable diction. She debuts at the Ascot Racecourse(with mixed success) and then attends a fancy ball where Eliza is a
triumph. Just as Pygmalion fell in love with one of his own sculptures
and brought it to life, Higgins falls for the newly confident Eliza. Afterthe usual roadblocks, they fall happily into each other's arms. The end.
Well, not quite.
If you pay attention, the story of My  Fair  Lady  is much richer and
more complicated than that skewed description. And one of the gifts
of director Bartlett Sher is to pay attention. He's delivered a string ofMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>successful revivals of classic shows, not by re-contextualizing them or
imposing some radical concept but simply by listening to the dialogue
being spoken, the lyrics being sung, the tale being unfolded. Payattention and a classic will reward you with fresh insight and humorand drama.
Here Sher focuses like a laser on Eliza and it pays dividends. At Covent
Garden our eye is always drawn to Eliza (Lauren Ambrose) even whenshe is lost in the crowd. We see Higgins and his new friend Col.Pickering (Alan Corduner) start to walk away, turning their backs on
the unfortunate creature they were dissecting just a moment ago. It is
Eliza who interrupts their departure to parse out exactly what Higginswas saying: with some lessons in diction, she could present herself asrespectable and move up in the world. Her way of speaking has
doomed Eliza to a life of menial servitude, but her way of speaking can
be changed.
The next day, Eliza shows up at the home of Henry Higgins and asks
to pay for lessons. She has agency, as someone criticizing the show's
gender politics might have to admit. It's not the wealthy Higgins and
his boast that put the plot into motion. It's not a genial taunt byPickering. It's the bold gamble of a flower girl who offers up herworldly wealth to pay for tutoring on how to speak proper.
Now that you're paying attention, you realize even Higgins admits
Eliza has a real gift for the task at hand. Once she's had abreakthrough, Eliza soaks up knowledge and works as hard as anyone.Indeed, when she reprises the song "I Could Have Danced All Night"after everyone has gone to bed, it's while grabbing some more books soshe can study in bed; Eliza is besotted with learning more than the
passing approval of her tutor. It's Eliza who charms and amuses the
posh set at Ascot with her frank talk, not just the faux pas we allremember during a race but by calling out a young man she imagineslaughing at her. Even under stress, Eliza won't be mocked.
It's Eliza who triumphs at a ball, proving such a perfection of precise
English that a rival to Higgins concludes it's too  perfect: she must be a
foreign born aristocrat! It's Eliza who leaves Higgins of her ownaccord. And it is Higgins  who comes running after her, begging Eliza
to accept him as he is, flaws and all. If Eliza comes back at the end, it'sclearly her choice to do so.
[In a rare missed opportunity, Sher could have underlined Eliza's
independence even more. At the ball, she is the talk of the evening.
But a suspicious rival phoneticist --   Professor Zoltan Karpathy -- is
circling, waiting for his chance to linguistically pin her down. It's an
acid test Eliza shouldn't have to face. Both Col. Pickering and Higgins'mother tell him to avoid the man at all cost. Why risk it? But Higginsand Eliza are dancing, the rival asks to cut in, Higgins hesitates...and
then hands Eliza over for the moment of truth. Yet how much better if
he hesitated...and Eliza  stepped forward of her own accord, ready to►  November (4)

<p>meet this final challenge when Higgins had doubt.]

So if Eliza as written is her own, steadfast self, why would anyone
think  My  Fair  Lady  is sexist? The answer surely lies with Henry
Higgins, who can be smug, condescending and silly. It's probably moreaccurate to say Higgins is a self-satisfied misanthrope, but let's assumehe is sexist. Clearly depicting a sexist man doesn't mean the
show  itself  is sexist, any more than  South  Pacific  is racist simply
because it holds up a mirror to such ugliness.
Does anyone take his battle-of-the-sexes number "I'm An Ordinary
Man" seriously? Higgins offers up a string of stereotypes about
women, albeit after acknowledging that when two people begin to care
for each other she may become tiresome but he becomes jealous andtyrannical. So romance makes both sexes rather irritating. Higginspresents himself in such exaggerated terms (he's got "the milk ofhuman kindness by the quart in every vein,"   etc.) that you can play it
as gently self-mocking or foolishly boastful but you can't play itseriously. If anything, the joke is on him.
Besides, Higgins is delivering a classic opening gambit for a romantic
comedy. He's the character who insists at the top of the show that they
will never,  ever  fall in love. The audience smiles because of course they
know -- sure as the sun will rise in the morning -- that this character
will fall head over heels in love by the end of the show, if not the endof act one.
Higgins says with some fairness that he's not rude to Eliza in
particular -- he's rude to everyone! That's not quite true: he is indeedrude to many people but Higgins is polite to his mother and Pickering,at least. A confirmed bachelor, stuck in his ways, Higgins can beinsufferable. So one of the cleverest ideas of Sher was to cast Harry
Hadden-Paton in the role. Higgins is usually played by an actor quite a
bit older than the one playing Eliza. (Julie Andrews was 20 and RexHarrison was 48 years old on opening night in 1956. ) With a mucholder Higgins, his ideas about women can seem...encrusted. He and
Pickering become an old boy's club, congratulating each other and</p>
<p>ignoring her after the success of the ball.
Here Hadden-Paton is actually three years younger than Ambrose,
though he "reads" a little older on stage. Turning Higgins into a
younger man than usual and making them contemporaries changes
the dynamics considerably. Now his pronouncements seem foolish andsilly, more akin to a boy who puts up a "no girlz allowed" sign on histree fort than a misogynist manifesto. Pickering becomes less of an
ally and more of a guilty conscience. And the blooming romance
between Higgins and Eliza feels more natural rather than paternal. Anelderly Higgins might just want an unpaid servant. A younger Higginsoffers the possibility of change and growth and genuine love.
But does he deserve her? In one of the trickiest songs in the canon,
Higgins has pleaded his case to Eliza and heads home in frustration,singing "I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face." Even when hishappiness is at stake, Higgins struggles to admit -- even to himself --that he loves her. Ironically, he can't speak the words.
SPOILER ALERT -- THE SHOW'S CLOSING SCENE IS DETAILED
In the show's boldest stroke, Eliza does indeed return to Higgins,
finding him alone in his library, listening to the voice of Eliza herecorded on the day of her very first lesson. He's a man hopelessly inlove, but perhaps hopeless at  love, as well. She stands face to face with
him, offering an intimacy they've never attempted before. Higgins, in adaze, mutters "Where the devil are my slippers?" just to havesomething to say. She strokes him fondly on the cheek...and thenstrides boldly off the stage up into the audience and out into the world
opening up for her. Higgins looks on, pride and tears crossing his face
in equal measure.
This isn't a terribly radical choice. It's the original ending of the
play  Pygmalion . It was the original ending of the script for the 1938
Oscar winning film that Shaw wrote. (He didn't know the filmmakers
shot it with the two leads clinching romantically until seeing thepremiere.) And it's been the ending of My  Fair  Lady  since day one.
Shaw fought any musical adaptation and almost certainly would have
not allowed one that changed his ending. So the theater world simply
waited Shaw out. He died in 1950. My  Fair  Lady  opened on Broadway
less than six years later.
This "new" old ending is an admirable, exciting, defensible choice. I
just don't think it works. Lerner and Loewe didn't write a show about
two people falling in love and then falling apart. Every scene, every
song brings them closer and closer together, with Eliza's newfoundconfidence prodding Higgins to break out of his shell and admit he's aman with feelings and needs. Maybe I'm too used to the contours of
this story. After all, it was the very first professional theater I ever saw,
starring Rex Harrison no less as he toured the country back in the veryearly 1980s. But if Eliza is going to leave at the end, I think earlier</p>
<p>scenes should play darker, with more emotion and more at risk. And
the staging doesn't help. Since we've seen Eliza step off the stage and
into the "real" world (if not the actual auditorium) at several points inthe show, her final breaking of the fourth wall doesn't have the sameimpact it might if it was taking place for the very first time.
END OF SPOILER
However it ends, it turns out that  My  Fair  Lady  really is a problem
play of sorts. Not the problem of sexism, but the problem of being
embalmed as a "classic." This is only the third revival on Broadway inmore than 60 years. One in 1976 lasted less than a year and one in1993 lasted less than six months. (I'm ignoring Harrison popping infor a few weeks with bus and truck version in 1981 I saw in Florida as
a child.) That's shocking for a show of such immense popularity,
boasting such great roles and offering a score that ranks among themost hummable and well-known in history. Who better than Sher totackle it? He brushed aside the issue of gender with good casting and afaith in the text. Unfortunately, he hasn't performed his usual magic of
burnishing a too-familiar show into something fresh and new, work he
did so well on musicals like South  Pacific  and the more
problematic  The  King  And  I.
Apparently, the wax museum quality of director George Cukor's hugely
successful but deadly dull film version has suffocated the show but
good. It preserved (in amber) iconic performances by Rex Harrisonand Stanley Holloway as Eliza's dad, not to mention the dazzling blackand white brilliance of the Ascot Racetrack scene. But, oh, how itdrags with all the self-importance of a prestige picture. Sadly, thosefaults are on display here. My  Fair  Lady  should be thrilling, its scenes
bursting with brisk excitement and humor, one great song tumblingafter another. In most musicals, you wait for the songs to begin. In MyFair  Lady,  the dialogue is so good you're completely absorbed until a
song pops in and you'd almost be annoyed if the songs weren't so good
they lifted you up into heaven. Not here. This edition moves with the
stately progress of an ocean liner, scene dutifully following scene likeisland stops on a cruise. Here on your left is "Wouldn't It Be Loverly"and coming up on your right? "With A Little Bit Of Luck!"

<p>One reason for this is the scenic design by Michael Yeargan. The
Vivian Beaumont is a jewel of a space and has a deep backstage that
only the Metropolitan Opera can match, I believe. Yeargan makes full
use of this when creating a photo-realistic home for Higgins thatincludes a front entrance, bathroom, stairways and a two-level libraryI not only applauded this particular set, I wondered if it was available
for rent. In a moment veteran theatergoers probably appreciated more
than most, one scene transition began with the library set poised way,way, way at the back of theater and slowly gliding into view. Theluxurious scope of the moment took your breath away. The problem is
that it was always  gliding slowly in and out. Every scene change
became such a parade that Sher fills the dead air with people moving
lampposts this way and that just to entertain the eye. Worse, a gap onthe left and right of the stage was needed to allow all these movingparts to twirl around one another. That meant giant black strips ofmaterial would glide down from the rafters to fill in the gap on eitherside. All well and good, but this happened so frequently it became
distracting, with the black strips yo-yoing up and down all night long
in their own merry dance.
Contrast that and the solid-looking Covent Garden with the more
"suggestive" (or bare bone) sets, like the cardboard pop-up of a bar
that Eliza's dad is forever strolling into for a pint. "With A Little Bit Of
Luck" in particular seemed to take place on a notably sparse stage, allthe more so when that lavish study hove into view a scene later. Andthat  seemed to contrast even more starkly with the elegant simplicity
of the set for Ascot, which suggested everything it needed with only an
unfolding canopy. Here costumer Catherine Zuber managed the neat
trick of nodding strongly to Cecil Beaton while leaving her own stampon the moment. True, not every location can be equally lavish but thescenic design lacked a uniform point of view.
Even the home itself felt fussy and overly-detailed. One brief gag takes
place when Eliza is dragged by a clutch of maids into a tiled bathroomfor a long overdue shower. It's a modest joke but we're stuck with thattiled space for the rest of the show, which is soon revamped into a
room with some sort of medical equipment. (I think.) In any case, the
home of Higgins is forever spinning like a top -- often quiteunnecessarily -- and every time it spins we see that tiled room, eventhough it is never used again and I became increasingly annoyed athaving to look at it. Couldn't the wall collapse and the room
"disappear" or not be used in the first place?
You begin to feel this My  Fair  Lady  is a dutiful recreation of moments
from the past rather than a living, breathing story taking place today.
It's more diorama than drama. That extends to some of the
performances. Norbert Leo Butz sounded like slam-dunk casting for
the role of Eliza's philosophizing father. But he brings nothingdistinctive to the role, seeming to show up and assume the memory ofHolloway and those two great numbers do the rest. "Get Me To The</p>
<p>Church On Time" can't help but land -- it's the show's most elaborate
number by far, but it's expert rather than thrilling. "With A Little Bit of
Luck" in particular felt rote, as if Butz were a year into the run ratherthan a week.
And why can't anyone rethink Freddy? Every production I've ever seen
offers up a silly fop of a Freddy (Jordan Donica) who belts out "On theStreet Where You Liiiiiiiiiiive" in a tiresome, old-fashioned style.
Donica is certainly a handsome man but he's asked to be a nonentity
like every Freddy before him. If only this Freddy were sexy andappealing. Imagine if Eliza was actually charmed  by him, at least on a
physical level. Imagine if he sang that standard with a lighter, defter
touch (Harry Connick Jr. does a nice, sure-footed version) rather than
declaiming it to the rafters. Higgins might worry about an actual rivalinstead of being able to dismiss Freddy as casually as we do. No suchluck.
One can't do terribly much with the other roles, though as Pickering
Allan Corduner sketches out a man that might be more of a foil to
Higgins than we're used to seeing. Manu Narayan is suitably silly asProfessor Karpathy. And if anyone deserves to glide gracefully on andoff stage it is certainly Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs. Higgins. She givesher scenes the warmth and bite they need.
That leaves our two leads. Harry Hadden-Paton is a solid, if not
revolutionary Higgins. His age does most of the work for him in termsof rethinking the part, though he is certainly jolted by more emotionthan found in the reserved Rex Harrison. And he nails "I've GrownAccustomed To Her Face," a piece that is far trickier than I ever
realized. Hadden-Paton might be more prickly, more frustrating, more
anything  really. But Sher guides him to a grace note that underlines
the better angels of Higgins and why Eliza flourishes. Yes he beratesher -- as he does others -- but who could take "you squashed cabbage
leaf" to heart? Then on the night of her breakthrough, when the rain
in Spain finally falls mainly on the plain, it's not the bullying that helpsEliza. The key to her trying just one more time is the way he brings hera cup of tea and speaks a few kind words, treating her with respect andshowing faith that she can accomplish this task. And suddenly she
does it!
That moment of intimacy speaks volumes, along with the way Lauren
Ambrose soaks it up like a flower thirsty for rain. If there is a flaw inthis perfect musical, it might be the lack of one more scene between
them where he appreciates her more as an equal than a flourishing
student. We are told after the fact that Higgins has come to depend onEliza, but he makes it sound more like she's a useful employee ratherthan his true love. All night long we see Eliza come into her own; yetfor Higgins, his emotional attachment to her is more implied, perhaps
to a fault.
We never doubt the change in Eliza, thanks to Lauren Ambrose in her</p>
<p>musical theater debut. For years we've been hearing that this excellent
dramatic actress was poised to do a big musical. First they announced
Funny  Girl.  Lauren Ambrose in the role that made Barbra Streisand a
star forever? Really?? And then it fell through. Then it was LaurenAmbrose in My  Fair  Lady,  the role that made Julie Andrews a star
forever. Really?? For those of us who never heard her sing a note, allwe could assume was that the woman sure as hell must be able to sing.And indeed she can. It's a lovely clear voice, if not a big brassy one. It'sa lucky thing she started with this show rather than Funny  Girl.
Ambrose can sing nicely and act the hell out of a lyric, but she's not
going to belt it to the back of the house a la Tyne Daly or EthelMerman. My  Fair  Lady  needs subtlety but Funny  Girl?  Not so much.
In a way, her vocal talent and neophyte status suit the part nicely.When Ambrose sails into a beautiful register, winning us over andexpressing the yearning or anger or joy of the moment, you're rootingfor her the same way you're rooting for Eliza. Performer and charactercoincide in a way they rarely do. In the future, she seems best suitedfor more thoughtful musicals a la Sondheim where her acting skills
will be put to the best use. Unlike Audrey Hepburn in the film version,
she wisely downplays the broad comedy of the early section (anotherreason Funny  Girl  wouldn't have been the best choice).
Some comic bits don't land, like the scene where Higgins and
Pickering share a pastry and she can only stare at it wistfully. This
might have as much to do with Sher as Ambrose. What she nails is thehunger and self-worth of Eliza, which is there all along from the flowerstalls of Covent Garden to the gilded ballrooms of the upper crust. Atthe ball, Hepburn was all grace and perfection; you never saw hersweat. Ambrose neatly lets the audience into the terror of the moment
so we can keep cheering her own. I can imagine her confidence and
performance growing throughout the run; this is almost certainly ashow you'll want to catch again before she leaves if you possibly can.
That would be a luxury, whereas with previous Sher productions ( The
Light  In  The  Piazza,  South  Pacific,  Joe  Turner's  Come  and  Gone,  Oslo
and more) revisiting a show of his felt essential. It's a first class
production, delivered with professionalism and skill and will surely bethe most successful revival since the original blockbuster run.
"Wouldn't It Be Loverly?" and "The Rain In Spain" and "I Could Have
Danced All Night" are all masterpieces and they're all here. You'll nodyour head and think, yes, that's pretty much how they're done.Christopher Gattelli offers fine choreography and Ted Sperling
conducts a lush 29 piece orchestra, an orchestra so big I may have lost
count. Craft is evident in every detail but you never quite feel theecstasy a great musical like My  Fair  Lady  should generate or even a
moment of surprise until right at the end. The pavement stays rightbeneath your feet from start to finish.
Perhaps my expectations were too high? But if Higgins can demand
the best from everyone around him and Eliza can expect the best from</p>
<p>herself, surely we can expect the best from this cast and creative team.
They've blown away the suggestions of sexism. Perhaps it will take
another production to blow away the dust.
NOTE: Lincoln Center produces The Lincoln Center Theater Review, a
lovely magazine filled with articles about their current production. The
current one is devoted to My  Fair  Lady  and while the collector's
program is always a treat, they've really outdone themselves this time.
It includes interviews, essays on the history of the show, poemsinspired by the Greek myth that gave Pygmalion its name, odes to the
show by other musical theater talent, a New Yorker cartoon and more.
It's all handsomely packaged with a gorgeous cover and a back pagedevoted to album art from the countless cast albums and recordingsbased on the show. if you're lucky enough to be in New York City, slipinto the lobby at Lincoln Center, leave the modest suggested tip and
snap up a copy fast.
