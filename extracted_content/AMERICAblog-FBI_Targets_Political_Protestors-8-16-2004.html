8/16/2004 02:58:00 AMBig Brother is watching. A major story in the New York Times saysthe F.B.I. has taken to aggressively going to people's homes andquestioning them about their political activities in an attempt, thegovt. claims, to target anarchists who might be planning violentprotests. Sounds fine when they talk about investigating people theFBI claims were planning to blow up news vans in Boston.But all of the people tracked down by the NYT seem positivelybewildered that anything they have done (participating in peaceful,legal political protests) could possibly be worthy of investigation bythe FBI. A couple of young guys were questioned before the Bostonconvention and decided not to participate in either that one or theupcoming Republican event. According to their lawyer,"they got the message loud and clear that if you make plans to go toa protest, you could be subject to arrest or a visit from the F.B.I."Targeting people for questioning by the FBI because they have takenpart in legal, political protests is of course outrageous and unnerving.Violent ourbursts like at the WTO events or WeatherUnderground-type criminal acts need to be countered. But thatdoesn't mean carte blanche to intimidate and harrass anyone whoshows up for a rally. The story lists a string of recent examples wherethe govt. overstepped its bounds in targeting Americans who weresimply exercising their Constitutional rights and had no cause to besingled out.The ones that need watching here are the FBI.
