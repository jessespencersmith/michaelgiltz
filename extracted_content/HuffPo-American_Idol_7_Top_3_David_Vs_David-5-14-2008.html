UPDATE ON THE WINNER:
Syesha Mercado really did overcome huge
obstacles to make it to the final three. Despite
looking terrific and delivering solid performances
week after week, she was invariably pilloried by
one or two or all three judges. Make fun of them
if you want, but I usually agree with them -- or at
least two out of three of them. Rarely do all three
get it wrong and I don't think they've ever been
so consistently wrong as they were with Syesha.
The first week she got respect was when she sang Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" -- and
that was only one week before she had to wave goodbye. But it was the right week for her to go
because the two Davids have clearly been headed for a showdown. And as the show has
emphasized, at least two weeks ago only one million votes separated the two of them. Where will
the people voting for Syesha go? Archuleta or Cook? Both of them teared up at their homecomings
this week, with Archuleta saying "gosh" a lot and Cook riding in a parade with his better looking
brother. But is Cook savvy or what -- smoothing out the egotistical edge and getting all touchy-feely
as the finals approach. Last week he gave a shout out to his mom and this week he honored hiselderly music teacher. Who are you rooting for and who is gonna win? I'm rooting for Archuletabut I'm going to vote for whichever one of them does better on that particular night. I really dothink it's up for grabs.
BELOW IS MY ORIGINAL POST ON PERFORMANCE NIGHT BY THE TOP 3
The top three finalists on Idol  performed last night amid the growing possibility that the inevitable
David Archuleta crowning is not in fact so inevitable. Last week, Ryan Seacrest said that the votesfor the top three contestants were each within one million of the next. That meant even if Archuletawere #1, he was no more than about a million votes ahead of David Cook, who was no more thanabout a million votes ahead of Syesha Mercado. Then last night Ryan Seacrest dubbed it "the

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 3: David Vs David
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-3-i_b_101676.html [4/5/2009 2:22:16 PM]closest race this show has ever seen." They may be referring to the closeness in voting for the top 3.
So if Syesha says goodbye tonight as expected -- amid huge but not as huge ratings as before  and
rumors of a meddling parent  -- who will her votes go to? You have to think they might either fall
away or go more often to David Cook. I know my brother -- who is as Middle America as it gets --
has grown bored with Archuleta, who may have played it too safe the last few weeks or more likely
just revealed himself as one-note. Now that he's feeling a backlash, I'm rooting for him more than
ever.
By the way, I'm in the South of France covering the Cannes Film Festival, but thanks to Slingbox
and my friend Aaron I'm able to stay on top of Idol  and talk with you about it, albeit without my
usual reference library at my fingertips to fake deep pop culture knowledge. On to the show:
The intro in which Ryan defined each contestant summed up their personalities nicely: a high
school student (David Archuleta just smiled goofily), an actress (Syesha made a goofy face, as in"who, me?") and a bartender (David Cook looked on with faux modesty, as if to say, dude, I'm arocker).
DAVID ARCHULETA -- Paula Abdul chose his song, Billy Joel's "And So It Goes," which was an
excellent choice that showed off his voice without making him seem too fuddy-duddy. The thirdsingle from Billy Joel's 1989 Storm Front album, it's a moody, mature ballad with a great melodyand hit #37. It's hard to believe Joel doesn't feel the itch to turn out a pop song every once in awhile, when he can deliver a gem like this. Archuleta began the tune a capella, which was a greatchoice and then slowly the strings came in. He only used a little of that Mariah Carey melisma(which is the inability to just sing a note without dancing around it for a moment or two),delivering most of the song in a straightforward manner. Towards the end he had a brief soulfulmoment, but it was restrained. I think David also made a good decision to ignore all the adviceabout not closing his eyes, licking his lips and so on -- better just to sing the way he's sung all hislife and work on those tics later. Really, I thought this was just lovely and wondered for a moment,"Has he been holding back?" A terrific rebound after several fallow weeks. Randy, Paula and Simonall were positive, though Simon sounded a bit bored when he said, "It was very good."
SYESHA MERCADO -- Randy Jackson chose the #3 hit "If I Ain't Got You" from The Diary Of
Alicia Keys.  Syesha -- who I've had a crush on from the start -- looked absolutely stunning the
entire night. She was very poised and in full Whitney mode. However, the arrangement was a little
busy at first - especially the background vocals -- and she seemed a bit lost in the mix, until the
chorus, which was great. Got stronger but then ended on a modest, quiet trill that didn't work great
but didn't diminish from a solid performance. Randy praised her; indeed every judge praised the
performance of the song they chose. But I disagree when he said that Alicia Keys was the sort ofmusic she should record. Unless she can write the songs, she'll be just one more diva instead of theBroadway baby we know she's destined to be. Randy also said, tellingly, "That's why you'restanding there as number three." Does he know something we don't about their standings? (I doubtit; just a slip of the tongue.) Paula also praised, as did Simon, who sounded surprised when headded, "You look gorgeous , by the way." Uh, she's looked great the entire series. Syesha is either
letting her hair down or calculatingly de-emphasizing the Broadway and going more down-home --she responded to Paula with, "Thank you, girl!" and later said she was just trying to "be meself," ina slangy sort of drawl. Is this the real Syesha or just a ploy to get more votes? Either answerappeals to me.
DAVID COOK  -- Simon chose for Cook to sing Roberta Flack's "First Time Ever I Saw Your
Face," Made famous by Clint Eastwood -- who showcased the tune beautifully in his directorial
debut Play Misty For Me  -- Flack's version of the folk tune was at #1 for six weeks in 1972. Oh and
by the way, what the heck? What a bizarre, left-field choice for Simon to make, who explained thathe wanted to challenge the singers and get them out of their comfort zone so they would have to becreative. Gee thanks, I'm sure Cook was thinking. But it worked. Unlike his breakthroughreworking of Lionel Richie's "Hello," Cook didn't overhaul this tune. he sang it straight for a while,starting with an acoustic guitar while surrounded on stage by violins. Then he let the song build toa typical emo finale. Expected, but frankly done with this particular song it sounded striking.Except for a brief weak moment on a high note, Cook sounded great, especially when he dug into ittowards the end. All three judges praised him, though Randy thought the song choice was wackand Simon said Round One went to Cook. I'd say it was a tie between him and Archuleta, withSyesha not so far behind.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-3-i_b_101676.html [4/5/2009 2:22:16 PM]DAVID ARCHULETA  -- Interestingly, all three contestants had their weakest moments when
making their own song choice. Just goes to show they don't really have a handle yet on what works
for them. Archuleta chose Chris Brown's "With You." Nice try to make himself seem youthful and
contemporary, but really it was a disaster. He was bouncing around on stage singing "I need you,
boo" and sounding and looking utterly unconvincing. It was an Up With People version of R & B.
He was quite lost and out of focus until the final seconds, where he ended ok, though not enough to
rescue the performance. Randy was mixed, though bizarrely he insisted this is the sort of upbeat,
youthful music Archuleta should record. Actually, the performance proved this is the last thing he
should attempt. Paula was polite and Simon was negative, saying it was like watching "a chiwawa
trying to be a tiger -- it's not really you." Exactly.
SYESHA MERCADO  -- She chose to sing Peggy Lee's "Fever," a fun song, but one done on Idol
before, so a bit boring from that perspective. Syesha made full use of a chair brought out on stage
and acted her ass off. But I was kind of waiting the entire performance for her to start really singingit. Her short dress looked amazing and the singing was solid, but never really caught fire. I lovestandards and "Fever" has been recorded dozens of times (at least). You better make the most of itwhen you do one and she didn't come close to stamping her own personality on it -- Syesha wasreally just using the sexy vibe of the tune to add more personality to her  image. Randy thought it
was the wrong song but said she sang it amazingly well. Paula was mixed (ouch!) and Simon saidshe would regret the decision to sing it.
DAVID COOK  -- He chose Switchfoot's "Dare You To Move" for its rock-ready melody and
inspiring lyrics ("Today never happened before," which sounds like a line from an Idol  finale tune,
a la "This is my now!") Cook was rough and colorless at the beginning, but got stronger once the
song picked up some steam. All three judges were negative, though not harshly so. Simon summedit up by saying all three had delivered just an ok middle round.
DAVID ARCHULETA  -- The producers chose "Longer" by Dan Fogelberg, a solid choice for
Archuleta that places him right where he belongs, in a Seventies, male, slightly wimpy singer-
songwriter tradition a la Bread and Fogelberg, which is better than the inspiring, very wimpy Josh
Groban field he'd been plowing. He's perched on a stool, with a button-down shirt untucked
(though not, like me, because he's gained weight) and does it well. "Longer than there've been stars
up in the heaven/ I've been in love with you." Archuleta throws caution to the wind and just opens
and closes his eyes whenever he wants, rather than struggling against his instincts to keep them
open like the last few weeks. And he ends well. Mothers and their daughters all sigh. All threejudges praise him, though Simon hates the song and calls it gooey. Duh! It's supposed to be gooey.He predicts again that Archuleta will get through to the finals.
SYESHA MERCADO  -- Ryan intro's her by making a joke about two middle-aged men and
saying they should buy tickets to the Idol  tour either alone or together depending on the situation
(ha! ha! Gay people are funny!) until an audience member says, "That's Syesha's dad" and Ryan
says he knows that and is just joking. Joking with Simon is one thing. Joking with an audiencemember, much less a contestant's parent is just odd. Happily, the two men just smile and ignoreRyan. The producers chose "Hit Me Up," a song from the Happy Feet  soundtrack I don't even
remember. Syesha looks young and sexy and does a fine job but the song is so anonymous that shekind of is too. Randy is mixed and Paula says "I don't know if it's good enough to get you into thefinals" which is like having your own mother slap you and say you're not good enough to win.Simon slammed the song choice and said nothing she'd done that night had equalled her terrificrendition of Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" from a week earlier. Very true.
DAVID COOK  -- The producers chose for him Aerosmith's #1 hit from the Armageddon
soundtrack "I Don't Want To Miss A Thing," a tune whose video I always found slightly creepy
since Steven Tyler is singing a romantic ballad while we're seeing his daughter Liv. Still, it's a finechoice for Cook, who gives a solid performane as he builds to a rousing climax -- and then theproducers of the show bizarrely and cruelly cut during the absolute finale of the song (we can hearCook wailing away pretty decisively) to focus on the guitarist and then the violinists. Cook hadabout 90 seconds and I swear 20-30 of them were spent on the musicians. This has always been apeeve of mine. It's nice to give the musicians in an establishing shot or a brief glimpse, but they arenot the story here. We need to see the singer. The final 30 seconds of this performance featuredalmost no Cook. It was a real injustice, especially since it makes it hard (for me at least) to judgehim as fully as I'd like. All three judges praise him and Simon says Cook won the night.

Reminisce About
India TripTHE TOP TWO  -- I assume it will be the two Davids but Syesha did look amazing and Archuleta
has definitely been feeling a backlash. Maybe Syesha could have an upset? I still predict Idol  will be
won by someone with the initials "D" and "A" but since they were within two million votes of each
other last week, this is a real horserace. I'd say Archuleta gave the single best performance of the
night while Cook was the most consistent and dealt with the curveball of "The First Time Ever I
Saw Your Face" very nicely. I think it'll be the two of them, but this could be the closest voting
since Florida in 2000. Who are you rooting for? What was your favorite performance? And why do
my posts get longer the fewer contestants there are?

Ditto what kellygrrrl said, Michael. It's been real. 
Unfortunately, as we get deeper into the season Huff Post gets more and more bloated and less and
less tolerable. Anyone else out there having major issues with this site? I'm almost ready to give up.
Okay, back to AI. Enough about the forrest. Can we get back into the trees? What's with David C

let contestants play instruments they should be heard and not just used as props. Similarly, is it just me
or did it seem like there were some ringers playing strings? In other words, in the Diane Warren songsome of the violin players surrounding David C looked not only like they weren't playing (the track was
canned) but also looked like they weren't really musicians, i.e., hands not moving, improper bowing
technique, etc. What's up with that?! Check it out if you still have show DVR'd.

Thanks for reading, DCDan. What are your specific complaints about HuffPo? Too many
posts on the same subject? Too many posts in general? More links to real stories preferred
over commentary from here? It' pretty much a collective with all the orginal posts being
written for free by the writers with HuffPo pretty much happily putting up anything andeverything and letting your taste search 'em out. (I encourage using the "I'm a fan of..." tofocus on your favorites. Let 'em know what you like/don't like. Are my posts too long? That'sbeen my biggest concern as far as my stuff.
As for AI, yep, the instrument has been a prop sometimes. But hey. if they can't play and
never use it, eventually they'll look stupid just holding an instrument during their performance.And were the violins taped? I can't imagine why they would pay all those people to appear oncamera and not use them, but I know not thing about bow technique etc.

Michael - just wanted to tell you how much I've enjoyed your coverage of AI this season. We reallyappreciate that you always comment back and we actually feel like we're discussing with the blogger. 
Any chance you'll cover So You Think You Can Dance?
I absolutely LOVE that show!

hey, i like that show too. i like reality shows where they have to have some talent or skill.

I just started watching So You Think You Can Dance halfway through last season
and enjoyed it. Especially Neil and Sabra dancing to Eurythmics. I also like
Nashville Star, which is the best Idol imitator and coming to NBC this summer. I'm
overseas and afraid to cover too much TV for free but I'll def watch SYTYCD via
slingbox and maybe keep the reality train rolling if I feel inspired after they finish the
audition process. Of course I'm a complete amatuer about dance as opposed to pop
music (which at least I cover and review), so not sure I have the smarts to do it right.

i'm not sure i care who wins between the two of them, though i simply don't like cook. i won't be votingfor either one. both will have careers. (and yes, giltz i will be watching.)
however, i think that in all the years of AI cook has to be one of the more arrogant "i'm already a star"
contestants with not a lot of goods to back it up (here's the routine: start slow, build up to a scream, andthen scream really really high for the last note and make sure the band gets really really loud to cover
up any voice problems). oh, but, wow, i forgot: he's this year's "rocker." oh. i guess that makes it okay.
even daughtry was better on AI, and he's also proven to make good CDs.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Cook has had the problem of seeming arrogant on camera, which may not reflect his
personality and just be a factor of how he's handling himself on TV. And yep, his approachhas been fairly cookie-cutter, though lots of bands have success plowing the same field. Hejust stands out, as you say, because he's the rocker and it's a welcome change from all theMariah Carey-like warbling. The Lionel Richie "Hello" was so startling because as far as I

know, that arrangement was original and striking. Most of the others have been lifted (wisely
and smartly) from other cover versions so it's hard to know what he'll be like on his own.

well, now we know Syesha got the boot. Not surprised, and there's no shame in coming in 3rd place.She lasted way longer than most people, including myself thought she would so kudos to her and goodluck the rest of her career.
As for last night, I enjoyed David C's 1st song the most, pretty much a left field choice of song and he
rocked it out. His 2nd and 3rd songs were ok.Syesha looked smashing all night and sang well on all three songs I felt. But the producers saddledher with a lame song that hardly anyone heard off. And even Paula was harshing on the girl!
David A's 1st song was well sung but predictable. 2nd song was a laughfest, the boy needs to learn
some dance moves and actually have kissed a girl to make a song like that work. 3rd song was just ok,
but really Dan Fogelberg? Couldn't the producers picked someone a bit more current?
No matter its the final we've all been waiting for. And I like it that you don't feel David A is a mortal lockto win.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I'm certain the producers wouldn't lie -- they might fudge or mislead but they wouldn't lie. And
they said the week of the Top 4 that the voting between the top three was only one million
apart between each person. So if the two davids were one and two, there was only one
million votes separating them. I think it's just as likely the slightly older voters supportingSyesha might go to Cook as to Archuleta who clearly has the tween vote locked in. Mind you,I still won't be surprised if he wins. But if Cook clearly outperforms him and Archuleta stillwins, I wil be surprised. A tie goes to Archuleta. Cook has to beat him,
kellygrrrl See Profile  I'm a Fan of kellygrrrl  permalink
If Cook wants this (which I question) he could absolutely BEAT him.
hopefully the "Winner's Song" whch they both will sing is not too much of a cheesy
ballad.

I sort of agree about the song choices and then being slammed for them. I'd still like to see some
serious rocking going on though.
OR just to be obtuse (right word here?) maybe going backwards to the fifties.Ooo I got one. Summertime Blues by Eddie Cochran THEN morph into the version by The Who. 1958
to 1970.
I just want to make it more interesting cuz frankly it's getting boring and overproduced.
Dave's gonna win.

Yes, I'd bet a lot of money that David is going to win, too. That medley of Summertime Blues
seems perfect for Cook, by the way.

I laughed so hard when Simon made fun of Cook for calling himself the Word Nerd.
Simon said no one would be into a nerd.Has Simon lost touch with the music scene? Does he even get that all Punk and Emo is NERDS?

Terrific point -- the emo boys are all nerds and Cook will fit in nicely. You have to admit that
Simon has been won over by Cook. I think he's rooting for Cook at this point, though as
always he'll acknowledge whoever gives the better performance week to week.

I must say something nice about Jason. I think he did a great job on Over the Rainbow and also on
Hallelujah. I liked them so much that I bought them.He was never going to win,but so what, all the girls love him and that ,I'm sure, makes him one happyguy.I think he's adorable.

if you truly like the "rendition" that castro attempted on AI, then do yourself a favor and buy"Facing Future" by the late truly great Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, who originated that particulararrangement. it's been in my cd collection for quite awhile.

Good article, Michael. Remember way back at the beginning Simon was very not into DC at theHollywood auditions. To see Simon warm up to DC has been the fun part for me. I think when you canwin over a sourpuss that's an achievement.
I don't think anyone has pimped DA. He has a great tone to his voice and works hard. I'm sure his
family and fellow Mormons really work hard on dialing in for him.
Syesha was a huge surprise surviving this long. Who would have thunk it?Overall, I think it has been a very good year and I just bought my concert tickets. Shh, don't tell anyone
about the presale.

Thanks for reading. You're right about Simon -- it is fun to see him get won over. It happened
with Clay Aiken too, didn't it? I've enjoyed this season too, which has had more than its shareof critics saying it was dull. I thought the singing quality was much higher than in the pastwhere you often wondered how most of them could have made it to the final 12 at all. I'venever been to the shows -- they avoid NYC, but would love to do it once.

for me, the best part of this season was all the very different styles in artists.
I enjoyed it! but I have to admit, over the last few weeks, I've kind of lost interest to
the point I really don't care anymore who wins. It's weird. Usually the last few weeksare the most fun to me.

frankly, i think it is an incredible testament to the "people's choice" that syesha made the top three.
week after week we learned that all three celebrity judges didn't think she deserved to be anywhere but
off the show. how difficult it must have been to have endured the continual mis-fired criticisms (while
having to listen to near-unfettered praise for one-notes like brooke white or non-singer like jasoncastro) and STILL remain professional, always smiling and congenial. good on you, syesha. 
i think she did just fine last night, but given the heavy weight of the davids, i assume she will be off
tonight. 
as much as everyone hated david archuleta's song choice for "with you" it was the first time in a long
time that i felt he was feeling the liveliness of the music - and i enjoyed the song. 
david cook turned me off the entire evening. he will start off a song pretty well, but cannot resist taking
it higher and higher and screaming into the mike. that's just not good. he ruined each song he sang last
night by doing just that. and please - the roberta flack tune was flogged by david at the end and simon
is simply a sadist for suggesting cook sing this song. 
with syesha out tonight, i frankly don't care who wins. i think all three will have a go at a career, so it
really doesn't matter.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Yep, you certainly don't need to win Idol to launch a career. No need to list the many
examples. The judges truly are not in charge -- they can influence voting big time but it's great
to see someone like Syesha who was rather bizarrely pilloried for most of the show hang in
there. I've been a fan from the start. You don't care who wins -- but you'll watch, right?
Charity See Profile  I'm a Fan of Charity  permalink
"...but you'll watch, right?"
funny you should ask, michael - i told myself that when syesha was voted off, i
would turn off AI for this season. i'm just that kind of person...LOL. but yeah, ofcourse, i'll watch the results for tonight and in all likelihood, watch the finals nextweek. i'm no long as pissed off as i am about the shafting that syesha got week after
week. and while i've been extremely disappointed with what seemed like a
concerted effort by the celebrity judges to get syesha voted off this season, i most
likely will give it a go next season, just like i always have. it's a fun show to watch
and get involved with, if one is going to watch episodic reality TV. and at my age,sadly, that's entertainment.

There's something perverse when the contestants sing three songs, two of those being chosen by thejudges and the producers. Then they are mercilessly hammered for bad song choices! 
We're praying that Cook wins it all. All three have careers locked in any case. Syesha could be a
television hostess/red carpet gal or star on Broadway. Archuleta could a game show on Nickelodeon.Cook could actually sell records a la Daughtry and Kelly Clarkson.
Archuleta was cute when he first sang, "Imagine". Who knew every song he would sing after that would
sound exactly the same, like something you'd hear in the Osmond Family Dinner Theatre elevator.
Keeping his father from being Col. Tom Parker is enough to hope he loses.
In any case, it's the judges that have grown tiring. How many times can Randy and Paula say "you
could sing the phonebook"? When was the last time of them actually looked through a phonebook? I'msure Paula simply tore the Pharmaceuticals page out of hers for convenience.
And even Ryan seemed off his meds last night, acting all loopy, telling the camera to get a closeup of
Syesha's chair (thanks, Ryan!). Then sitting in Syesha's little chair while he looked up at Cook sittingthe Jetsons sky chair. Maybe Ryan has a chair-crush. Weird.

Anyway, when the normally professional Seacrest starts prancing around like he's been licking the toad,
maybe those falling audience numbers are starting to make the folks nervous.

I'll admit the judges have seemed fairly repetitive this year -- meaning Randy and Paula. I'dhate to mess with the chemistry but look forward to seeing what new blood will bring. I'mcertainly available if they want someone with absolutely no music industry experience. Youseem to be in line w a lot of people who have found Archuleta repetitive. Maybe that'll affectthe voting -- but it sure hasn't stopped Josh Groban from having a career. Not that I'd buy thatalbum.
