Orson Welles Portfolio: Sketches and Drawings From The Welles Estate  
BOOKFILTER’S WINTER PICKS FOR THEATER LOVERS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | FEBRUARY 13, 2019
SHARE</p>
<p>By Simon Braund
$50, Titan Books
The remarkably talented Orson Welles conquered theater and radio and film in a meteoric
career. He made it all seem easy – working on a radio show before dashing off to the theaterand then sketching out new ideas over a late dinner. For him, it was easy. Among his manyskills? Visual design. This coffee table-worthy book authorized by the Welles estate is burstingwith sketches and drawings and storyboards, the genesis of ideas that would come to fruitionwith work like his groundbreaking voodoo “Macbeth” on stage, the film “Citizen Kane” and athousand other projects both real and only imagined. From his early childhood fascination withShakespeare to tantalizing glimpses of what might have been, these artistic offerings show aprotean talent free to dream big. Now if only someone would rescue and reissue the Wellesguide to staging Shakespeare’s plays that he published when barely a lad!
Leading Men</p>
<p>By Christopher Castellani
$27, Viking
It’s safe to say “Tennessee Williams” is not the playwright’s greatest creation: too many of his
characters are forever seared into our consciousness. But boy, the colorful Tennessee suregives them a run for their money. It’s no wonder author Christopher Castellani chose to base hisdebut novel on that vivid, larger than life man and perhaps his one true love. That would beFrank Merlo, a blue collar guy from New Jersey who served honorably in World War II and thenserved honorably as the right-hand man and devoted partner to a needy but generous giant ofthe theater. In this acclaimed work, Castellani describes the glamorous but secretive world ofgay men in the 1950s with what the New York Times dubbed almost a Fitzgeraldian glow.Williams and Merlo shared their lives from 1947 (when Williams was already a superstar) to 1963and “Leading Men” captures in full their bittersweet and sexy and sad romance.
Sounds Like Titanic: A Memoir</p>
<p>By Jessica Chiccehito Hindman
$25.95, W.W. Norton
Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman had the makings of a nutty, hard-to-believe memoir. This aspiring
violinist made it from the mountains of Appalachia to study classical music at ColumbiaUniversity in New York City. So how did she end up touring with The Composer, a purveyor ofeasy-listening faux-classical music hawked at street fairs and PBS drives around the country?Worse, she never really played the violin on stage; she and other musicians simply mimed aperformance for audiences while a CD played through the speakers. From endless nights eatingat chain  restaurants to smiling as fans snatched up one crappy album after another while
praising Hindman’s talent, her dream of being a professional violinist had turned into adepressing — but profitable — nightmare. But her professional nadir is just the starting pointhere. Hindman also jumps back and forth in time, describing in intimate detail her childhoodobsession with the violin, the genuine sacrifices her family made to get her lessons, and how,even at 11 years old, Hindman realized she was good … but not that good. Hindman turns aone-note joke of a job into a rich and painful look at the drive to succeed in the arts. She mayhave fallen short as a violinist, but she triumphs as a writer.

th</p>
<p>By Kathleen Collins

The late Kathleen Collins exploded onto the literary scene with her posthumous short story
collection “Whatever Happened To Interracial Love?” Now her sadly neglected body of workgrows even more impressive with this new collection. Along with diary entries and more shortstories, it contains both an unmade screenplay and an unproduced play.

Monty Python Speaks: An Oral History
By David Morgan
$17.99, Dey Street Books
Whether you think of their concert comedy performances, the smash Broadway musical
“Spamalot!” or direct descendants like the silliness of “The Play That Goes Wrong” (nowensconced Off Broadway and on tour) or Taylor Mac’s upcoming comedy “Gary: A Sequel ToTitus Andronicus,” Monty Python’s influence on the theater is obvious. (Indeed, the perfectfarces of the sitcom “Fawlty Towers” would make a delicious stage show.) So theater buffs of asilly sort should delight in this revised and updated oral history of Monty Python. They began inTV and conquered film but they are vaudevillians at heart. Anyone who loves the theater shouldlove learning more about their absurd, sophomoric and brilliant work.</p>
<p>A Working Diary
By Julie Hesmondhalgh
$25.95, Methuen Drama
Actor Julie Hesmondhalgh typifies the life of so many British actors, at least those who are
talented and in-demand. In 2016-2017, she jumps back and forth from stage to TV to film toradio, all while keeping a diary that should be a treat for fans and aspiring actors alike. Bestknown in the UK for her long-running stint on the primetime soap “Coronation Street,”Hesmondhalgh documents a remarkably productive period. She was wrapping up a year oftheater with her politically committed troupe Take Back. And then – take a deep breath – shetackled everything from the third season of the TV drama “Broadchurch” to a revival of the play“Wit” that might just transfer to the West End to diving into extensive rehearsals with directorMike Leigh for his epic period film “Peterloo.” And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. As oneexpects from British actors, Hesmondhalgh is witty, insightful, self-deprecating and wears herintelligence easily.
