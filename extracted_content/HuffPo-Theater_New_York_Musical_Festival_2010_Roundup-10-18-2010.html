Whew! I am musicaled out. If no one breaks into song
for the next few weeks, I'll be happy. But I'm also
satisfied: the New York Musical Theatre Festival  is a
chance to gorge on new works, spot some talent and
maybe see an early version of a show that will turn
into a hit Off Broadway or even on Broadway. It's an
annual event, though NYMF also sponsors year-roundevents to support musical theater. Out of about 27fully-staged musicals, I managed to check out 13.
Here's a rundown of the shows in the order I saw
them, along with links to my full reviews on AOL's gayblog Queersighted , where you'll usually find video
clips and links to their official websites. (The last few
will be posted in the next day or so.)
NIGHTTIME TRAFFIC  ** out of ****  -- Alex Wyse wrote the book, music, and lyrics for this tale of
two young lovers who turn the night before major surgery for one of them into an epic adventure thanks
to a friendly nurse with drugs that can turn a minute into an hour of experience. Too many of the
numbers are wan art songs, but a few promising numbers show that Wyse has the talent to do more.
WITHOUT YOU  ***1/2 out of ****  -- Anthony Rapp's one-man show is based on his acclaimed memoir
Without You , which charts the rather remarkable experience of being in the world-beating, life-changing
hit Broadway musical Rent  while dealing with two tragedies: the sudden unexpected death of the show's
composer Jonathan Larson and the slow decline and death from cancer of Rapp's mother as Rent  moves
from a tiny workshop to Broadway. At the end of the show, Rapp is at a memorial for his mother, singing
the funeral number piece from Rent , "Without You." Suddenly you realize again why that show about
downtown artists struggling with AIDS proved such a hit: pain and loss (and carrying on) are universal.

<p>This polished, lovingly done and very moving work just proves that again.
TESS: THE NEW MUSICAL  ** out of ****  -- The ambition outstrips the talent of sister act Annie and
Jenna Pasqua when they tackle the classic Thomas Hardy novel. The result longs for Les Miz but is more
akin to the bland Frank Wildhorn, though Nick Cartell is a standout as the angry, passionate Angel.
SHOW CHOIR  ** out of **** -- The cast is fine overall, and Gary Slavin (who directed and co-
choreographed with Donald Garverick) sometimes makes you feel like something original is about to
happen. But the book, music, and lyrics by Mark McDaniels and Garverick let them all down.Undoubtedly the show was created by people with a genuine love for show choirs. Nonetheless, it feels
like the entire enterprise has its cynical eye on an off-Broadway run for undemanding tourists, right down
to mildly naughty twists (Two of the show choir guys are gay? Gasp!) and the unfunny spoofs of Regis
Philbin and Kelly Ripa. The cleverly mocking opener and the genuine emotion of "Back Row" prove they
have the talent, if only they're willing to skip the easy stabs at humor and standard plot points, and then
dig much deeper. Even silliness needs to be taken seriously.
BLOOD TIES  *** out of ****  -- Ned Massey is the guy in the bar who collars you with what sounds like
a tall tale: he was the last guy discovered by legendary talent scout John Hammond, who also signed
Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin....you get the idea. But Hammond suffered
a heart attack while they were recording Massey's debut and one bad bit of luck followed another asMassey struggled to turn that early break into an honest to goodness career. This autobiographical showtells his story and of course might just be the one last chance he has at success. Massey is a clear-eyedpresence and he's surrounded by a very able cast. George McDaniel and Nancy Ringham are solid but
more effective in secondary parts than in their main roles as father and mother. But the shining presence
here is Katie Thompson, who is exceptional as Massey's girlfriend and later as another lover whobecomes his wife, knocking out songs with country abandon whenever called for and making us like
Massey more just because she likes him too. Wherever this show goes, she better go with it.
POPART  * out of ****  -- A bland teenage girl who complains that she always blends in during high
school -- even with a drunk of a mom and a gay dad -- heads off to art school. There she meets kooky
characters, loosens up, discovers she's a wildly talented artist who just needs to let her freak flag fly, andscores big at the annual art show for critics. That's the entire plot of POPart The Musical. However
familiar and predictable it may sound, that doesn't really matter if the songs are good. Unfortunately, the
songs by Daryl Lisa Fazio (book and lyrics) and Aaron McAllister (music) don't liven up the tale one bit.
FROG KISS  *** 1/2 out of ****  -- Frog Kiss  is not just a heck of a show by the standards of a festival
devoted to nurturing new work (the raison d'etre of the New York Musical Theatre Festival). It's a heck of
an entertaining musical comedy by any standards, Broadway included, which is where it deserves to be,current cast right along with it. At the very least, Frog Kiss  deserves a much longer life off-Broadway or
anywhere else you can get tickets. For all the talent on display (and that includes virtually everyone), therevelation for me was the catchy, jazzy music by Eric Schorr and the book and lyrics by Charles Leipart, atalent completely unknown to me but one that is apparently flowering right now with numerous works
like a musical version of Enchanted April  and an original show called Lady on a Carousel at various
stages of development. Here he's delivered a musical in the vein of Once Upon A Mattress  and Honk!
and it's a winner.
FELLOWSHIP! * 1/2 out of ****  -- I'm geeky enough to have seen two musicals based on The Lord of
the Rings : the official, lavish Toronto and West End production that seemed like a bad joke when it was
announced, and now  Fellowship!,  a musical parody that is a bad joke and playing as part of the New

<p>York Musical Theatre Festival. One show cost tens of millions and featured a Celtic air, elaborate special
effects, puppets, and would-be show-stoppers. The other show cost tens of dollars (in a good way) and
also features a Celtic air, not to mention rock guitars, puppets, a would-be show stopper, and other
silliness. Neither one has very good songs.
TRAV'LIN'  *** out of **** -- Broadway used to produce breezy entertainment like Trav'lin -- "the new
1930s Harlem Musical" -- in its sleep. Now it seems like a minor miracle. The recipe is simple: take a
body of songs by a talented if under-appreciated artist, in this case JC Johnson. (No, I'd never heard of
him either, but since he co-wrote songs with the likes of Fats Waller and Andy Razaf I wasn't surprised to
recognize a few of his tunes.) Then build a romantic comedy around them, fill the cast with talentedactors and boom, you've got a show. This one is sure to have a future production. Yes, you can map outthe entire plot about ten minutes into the show and you won't care a whit. Karla Mosley and Michael Jean
Dozier have wonderful chemistry as the young lovers, though Mosley is still mimicking her betters when
she goes for the red hot mamma notes. Soara-Joye Ross and Randy Donaldson milk every laugh out of
their battles, with Donaldson having the weakest voice in an otherwise strong-singing cast but making up
for it with charisma and comic timing to spare. Doug Eskew is simply a rock as George and holds the
stage with aplomb, which is not easy to do when Brenda Braxton is commandeering it as Billie, the heart
and soul of the show.
FINGERS AND TOES  ** 1/2  out of **** -- The set-up is simple. Fingers, a composer facing writer's
block when it comes to his symphony, is despondent. His buddy Toes appears with some amazing news.
A famed producer is coming in two weeks to check out their show and maybe book it into one of his
resorts. The only problem? They don't have a musical. Yet. The guys start by auditioning broads and you
don't get any points for knowing that the last gal to show up ("Sorry I'm late!") will prove a game one,who can sing and dance and (bummer) has a boyfriend. That ain't gonna last. Medland has a definite giftbut he's limited here to a narrow range of emotion and style. The same is true of his book, which has too
many jokes that call for a rim shot from the band. Jonathan Monro is a solid foil as Fingers for the brash
Leo Ash Evens as Toes, the ladykiller and razzle-dazzler. But they're both outshone by Stephanie Gibsonas Molly Molloy. She can do it all and no wonder they both fall for her, but hard. This particular show has
probably gone as far as it should, but Medland and his cast will surely be going farther.
THE GREAT UNKNOWN  ** 1/2 out of **** -- Nice ambitious tale about a group of explorers heading
out west in the post Civil War era. A good cast and some stand out tunes by Jim Wann. This one might
need to be substantially longer in order to do its story and solid cast justice.
OUR COUNTRY  * out of **** -- A country superstar is outed and watches his career implode. This show
is his comeback concert in the back of a seedy gay bar. Think Hedwig crossed with Ty Herndon.
Unfortunately, the songs by Tony Asaro are country only in the vaguest sense (references to mud flaps
and the such) and lead performer Justin Utley has a voice much more suited to Broadway. There's not a
twang within a mile of this show, even taking into account that "country" covers everything from the popof Taylor Swift and Antebellum to the rock of Steve Earle and Dwight Yoakum to traditional fare like
Randy Travis. Whatever country music is, it ain't this. And the book isn't any better, though Jeremy
Pasha squeezes out a few modest laughs as a gay keyboardist.
SHINE! THE HORATIO ALGER MUSICAL  ** 1/2 out of **** -- A plucky lad in 1800s New York
City pulls himself up by his bootstraps, thanks to hard work, a cheerful demeanor and a fair amount of
luck. You could play those corny Horatio Alger tales for laughs or -- like Shine! -- you could play itstraight. The result is a very handsome production with a large cast and some modest props ably directed
by Peter Flynn and choreographed by Devanand Janki to maximum effect. Unfortunately, the songs by
Roger Anderson and Lee Goldsmith just don't deliver, whether it's the tepid love ballad "Maybe Today"(reprised again and again), the cynical "Cock and Bull" or the comic "A Handful O' Hops" (which is
actually not bad, but comes far too late in the story, when suspense should be the focus, not comic
relief). Andy Mientus has the right wholesome but not dopey air for our hero, but without good songs,what's a street urchin to do?
