~ I n the new documentaly r Li.ve Nw1£ (firis. UNITE! 
filinmakej Julia Query 
<pmes out to ,her mother on­
camera-as a stripper. Mom al­
ready knew she was a lesbian, 
and that was fine. Query was 
also a union organizer: Live 
Nw1£ Girls UNITE! is the seri­
ous but funny chronicle of the 
women of the Lusty Lady The­
ater in San Francisco-the first 
(and, so far, only) strippers to 
unionize. Hearing women on a 
picket line chant "2-4-0-8, don't 
go in to masturbate!" is price­
less, but Query's personal story 
gives this film its kick: Her 
mom, Joyce Wallace, a long­
time activist for New York's 
streetwalkers, is aghast to find 
out that her college-educated 
daughter takes it all off. "I had 
never had her be so disapprov­
ing berore," ~ys Query, 32, 
who has since reconciled with 
herI]lom 'Td never had her 
walk away and not Can me for .' ; three mon~ fd never had her "o( ...... ,actually say she was 
tprQud of me. Be=
