 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: Musical "Carrie" Is Bloody
Serious; "Assistance" Needs Some
CARRIE  ** 1/2 out of ****
ASSISTANCE  ** out of ****
CARRIE  **1/2 out of ****
MCC  AT LUCILLE LORTEL
The last thing you want to do is pick on Carrie . This
(in)famous musical has lived on in theater lore as one of
Broadway's biggest flops. As often happens, serious
theater buffs have always suggested a strong score was
lost in the flames of that burnout. Now after many years,
a serious, somber new Carrie  has emerged with some new songs, a new book, a new focus and the same
old bucket of blood that made the movie and novel by Stephen King so iconic. Like the original Broadway
Carrie , this show can boast two very strong performers in the lead roles of Carrie and her mother (Molly
Ranson and the great Marin Mazzie). They are the central reason -- perhaps the only reason other than
curiosity -- to see this show.
You know the story from the novel by Stephen King or the movie starring Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie and
John Travolta. Carrie is a frumpy teenager with two strikes against her: she has to deal with a repressive
mother at home and bullying at school. Her mother has taken refuge in fanatical religious beliefs and afear of intimacy ever since she was raped and made pregnant with Carrie. Her refusal to discuss anything
physical explains why Carrie is completely confused when she has her first period in the girl's locker
room, causing the other students to mercilessly make fun of her yet again.
Oh, and arriving with Carrie's "curse of blood" are telekinetic powers that she uses to move chairs, close
windows and ultimately wreck a terrible revenge for the cruel way the other students treat her. Itclimaxes with the prom where Carrie wrongly believes everyone is mocking her (getting covered in a
bucket of pig's blood will do that to you), snaps emotionally and telepathically destroys everyone in sight
before a final showdown with her mother.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>The story is straightforward enough, though in this era of heightened awareness about bullying, it seems
a mistake not to leave Carrie  set in the 1970s. Other than some very brief references to cyber-bullying,
there's nothing in the story that makes this Carrie  feel contemporary. It's much easier to accept the
cluelessness of teachers in dealing with bullying if the year was 1976. In 2012, bullying still takes place ofcourse. But if only for legal reasons, the response of teachers and administrators would be very different.
A further problem is that this serious, quiet piece sometimes feels like an After-School Special about
picked-on teens. The psychic powers are downplayed so much they seem held in abeyance until the grand
finale. Someone unfamiliar with the story almost might not realize what's going on in that department,
whereas in the book and movie Carrie is constantly battling to hold her psychic rages in check; that adds
to the tension and ultimate tragedy.
Carrie's main tormentor is Chris (Jeanna De Waal) and in that character's big number, "The World
According To Chris," we get not one but two  reasons for her being so mean: she has an obnoxious father
who constantly pushes her with his dog-eat-dog philosophy and it's implied that he might even physically
abuse her. (I think it's implied; the lyrics are sometimes hard to discern with the amplification and sharpsinging; my guest did not catch the same meaning from the references to whipping and scars that I did.)
Couldn't she just be a mean, vindictive jerk?
But what really matters are the songs, with music by Michael Gore (including the score of course) and
lyrics by Dean Pitchford. Just like their work on the movie Fame , they have produced one or two gems
among other merely serviceable numbers.
The show begins with good girl Sue (Christy Altomare) being grilled by police after the inexplicable
tragedy of the prom. This is a nod to King's book, which pretended to pull together newspaper articles,
books, reports and other "documents" to tell the story of Carrie. But the very brief interludes with Sue
being questioned ("We were only kids!" she pleads) offer absolutely no perspective or necessary
information. It's barely returned to at the end of the show (and to no emotional impact) and should be
dropped.
Then comes the opening number "In," with the students dancing vaguely like zombies while singing
about the pressure to conform. It's spookily backlit like a horror show and would have been a much better
opening on its own. The choreography by Matt Williams is at its best here. That's followed by "Carrie,"
with our heroine pretty fierce and self-confident from the start. She hardly seems like a wallflower youcan push around, even here. The good kids come off most boringly, with Derek Klena in the role of Finn -
- I mean, Tommy -- who is given a poem set to music called "Dreamer In Disguise" that is all too
convincing as the bad lyrics of a teenage jock trying to be sensitive. ("An eagle's just an eagle until hespreads his wings," for example.) That's followed by an even blander song by his girlfriend Sue, who feelsbad about teasing Carrie and convinces Tommy to invite the poor thing to prom as his date. Their later
duet "You Shine" is duller still, matched by the weak duet "Unsuspecting Heart" sung by a kindly teacher
(Carmen Cusack good in a small turn) and Carrie.
As with the movie, almost everything interesting takes place at home between Carrie and her fanatical
mother. At various points throughout the show, the vocal arrangements strive for an almost operatic feel,
with performers beginning their lines shortly after one another until they join together on a chorus. The
effect is more cacophonous than high art, unfortunately, with a number of duets and group songs rather
hard to figure out musically and lyrically.
But the voices of Ranson and Mazzie blend beautifully and give this musical a depth and impact it would
otherwise sorely lack. They shine on "And Eve Was Weak," "Evening Prayers," and "I Remember How
Those Boys Could Dance." The songs aren't great, but Mazzie and Ranson make the most of them with
their conviction and strong voices. The one truly satisfying, theatrical moment of the evening occurs
when Carrie has defied her mother (not so hard to do when you can unnerve her with supernatural
powers) and gone to the prom. On a darkened stage, Mazzie sings "When There's No One," a song thatavoids the fanaticism of her earlier numbers to reveal the painful loneliness and fear at the heart ofMargaret's behavior.
Ranson gives as good, though she rarely has the material that can let her truly shine as she might. At the
finale, Ranson echoes the sappy poetry of Tommy by singing the line about an eagle being just an eagle
till it spreads its wings and she raises her arms like a bird with her fingers curled into menacing claws. It
might have had serious impact if she didn't have to reprise numerous other songs from the show at this
crucial moment.
Less crucial is the destruction of the school. Everyone who knew I was going wanted to learn how the
slaughter would be staged. Not surprisingly, it's theatrical, not literal for the most part. if the story wasmoving you emotionally, it wouldn't matter how the killings were staged; they would still have an impact.
Since most of the students are fairly generic, all the fireworks in the world won't make the scene work on
a dramatic level. For the record, it involves some effective visual displays of flames and whooshing soundeffects before Carrie returns to the stage drenched in blood, just like you would expect.
Throughout, the digital displays smoothly change the scenes from locker room to darkened home to gym
with minimal fuss. Director Stafford Arima wisely keeps the focus on the emotional heart of the story. It's
a noble, serious effort. But with an unnecessary framework, too many characters flatly drawn and songs
that don't dig deep enough, it's hard not to spend this Carrie  waiting for the bloodbath to come.HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 2

<p>Here's the trailer from the Sissy Spacek/John Travolta film. (Note: King was such a new author, they
spell his name wrong in the trailer!)
ASSISTANCE  ** out of ****
PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONS
Playwright Leslye Headland must be a joy to work with. She's managed to attract a top-notch cast to her
rather tepid tale of assistants working for the proverbial boss from hell. The business is never identified,
the boss is never seen, but the pattern of the play falls into a dull, predictable routine rather quickly,
much like drudge work itself.
Two employees are seated at desks across the stage from each other. One is the chief assistant and the
other is the backup. The chief assistant frantically deals with the unreasonable demands of evil bossDaniel while hoping to train the second assistant to take his or her place so he can get a promotion and
move out of this living hell. That's about it. The assistants change places, sometimes one person moves
on and other times a new scene begins and you realize the poor assistant is still trapped in their job.These vignettes are interspersed with solo scenes where an employee talks to someone else, maybe a
parent or therapist, about their miserable existence.
Headland has a few funny quips and director Trip Cullman moves things along. But nothing can disguise
the essential dramatic thinness of the proceedings. No one is particularly vicious or backstabbing (the
worst complaint is maybe incompetence or dropping the ball despite their best efforts). Two assistants
develop a romantic attachment and while it's true one of them was dating someone, basically there'snothing personal or professional blocking them from being together so it's hard to care when theystruggle to maintain a connection.
Yes, the stakes are high -- people could and do lose their jobs and god knows the economy is bad enough
to make finding a new one difficult. Yet no one faces any major ethical dilemma. They're all pretty much
doing the best they can and despite some vague hints of Darwinian behavior, they all behave decentlymost of the time and don't try and screw each other over to get ahead. So where, exactly, is the drama?
The belief that this very light comedy has nothing to say is driven home by an utterly pointless, almost
embarrassing finale in which one character begins to dance their heart out and the office comes "alive"
with chairs spinning, copiers spitting out paper and water pouring from ceiling head sprinklers in a
desperate attempt to end with a bang. Despite this (and despite the unearned nod to the Thin Manmovies by calling the main characters Nick and Nora), the cast is strong throughout, with Michael Esper
solid as Nick (despite a first scene weighted down by sub-Mametian dialogue) and Bobby Steggert scoring
strongly in an all too brief turn. Virginia Kull also has moments as Nora, the richest role for the women in
the cast; I look forward to seeing her in something better soon.</p>
