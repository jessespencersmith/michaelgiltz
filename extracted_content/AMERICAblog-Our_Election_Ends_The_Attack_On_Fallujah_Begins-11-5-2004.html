11/05/2004 02:53:00 AMWhat a coincidence that we've decided to move on Fallujah just afterthe election ends. The insurgents have been in control of that cityand the longer we waited to attack, the longer they had to dig in andencourage others to join them simply by surviving.The bombing has begun and hopefully we'll be able to subdue themquickly. (Happily, most citizens fled the city long ago. But it's gonnabe bloody.) With elections only weeks away, does anyone think it wassmart militarily to wait and wait like Bush did? He simply wanted tohold off until after the election so Americans wouldn't be hearingabout bloody battles and (more) dead G.I.s.But that unnecessary, militarily (and politically) foolish delay mayvery well mean that more of our soldiers die than was necessary.Here's praying it goes smoothly. Bush has plenty of fiascos on thedomestic front to bite him in the ass -- here's hoping Iraq doesn't getany worse.
