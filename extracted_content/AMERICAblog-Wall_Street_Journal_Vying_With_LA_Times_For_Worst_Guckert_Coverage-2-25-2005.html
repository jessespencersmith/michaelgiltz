2/25/2005 12:49:00 PMThanks to tizzie for pointing us to this Wall Street Journalarticle today about James Guckert. It continues the LA Timesangle that this is a case of old media versus new media andwho gets to decide what constitutes a real journalist. Again,not ONE quote from a source who argues that Guckert wasindeed a fake journalist and that this is a serious issue aboutnational security and the manipulation of the media by theWhite House."The fact is that the history and tradition of the White Househave been much more open and accepting" of nonmainstreamjournalists than other Washington institutions, such as theCongress, says Ari Fleischer, Mr. McClellan's predecessor to theWall Street Journal. "I think it would be a real shame if thattradition ended. It might be good for the press secretary butnot for diversity of opinion."The story is filled with offbeat reporters who also attend theWhite House press conferences, though it doesn't make clearwhether they all get repeated day passes or have hard passeswhich demand a security check -- the very security checkJames Guckert would have failed.This isn't about his anti-gay, far right politics. If Rush Limbaughand Maureen Dowd applied for a day pass to the White Housepress room, they both would deserve to get one.But, again, this is not old media versus new media or about thedifficulty of figuring out what constitutes a real journalist.James Guckert aka Jeff Gannon received a day pass to theWhite House press room before he'd ever written a singlearticle for any news media outlet of any sort in the entireworld. He wasn't even affiliated with any media outlet -- real ofimaginary -- when he received a day pass as a reporter to theWhite House. I think if you're going to draw the linesomewhere, that seems a pretty good place to start.Yes, a few weeks later, GOPUSA.COM set up the fake newswebsite Talonnews.com and yes, eventually their "volunteer"reporter James Guckert started getting paid half wagesbecause even fake journalists have to get paid something inorder to get press passes. But slowly building up a front overthe years doesn't change the fact that James Guckert wasallowed into the White House press room when NO ONE underany conceivable standard could consider him a journalist.
