            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  1 4 ,  2 0 0 7It's Fiddy Cent, By The WayMy friend Sam in Florida was at the record store with his son. All thekid wanted was Soulja Boy, Soulja Boy. So Sam dutifully went with thekid (who's like 11 years old) to the S's at the music store and keptlooking up "soldier" and couldn't find the damn CD and when he spoketo an employee he felt so OLD because he wasn't cool enough (or morespecifically young enough) to simply know that it was spelled S-O-U-L-J-A-H.I told this story to my friend Joe and he emailed back:If only he would have dug up the single from “Billy Jack,” “One TinSoldier (Rides Away).”And I emailed back:That would have been under "c" for Coven, the demonic sounding bandthat had their one and only hit with "One Tin Soldier (The Legend OfBilly Jack" - not to be confused with "Invincible (Theme from TheLegend of Billy Jean)" by Pat Benatar -- not to be confused with"Legend of Wooley Swamp" by the Charlie Daniels Band -- not to beconfused with "The Legend of Jesse James," the multi-artist countryconcept album created and written by Paul Kennerly and championedby Emmylou Harris on her new boxed set -- not to be confused with"Legend of The Pianist" from "The Legend of 1900" by Ennio Morricne-- not to be confused with Legend, the Tom Cruise fairy movie with ascore by Jerry Goldsmith that replaced a far superior score byTangerine Dream that was used in the European release of the film butdumped in America.Yes, I need a life.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
