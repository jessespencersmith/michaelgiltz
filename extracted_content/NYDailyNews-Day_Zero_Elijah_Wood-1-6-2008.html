€lijah Wood is getting drafted
... again. In last year's multi-
character drama "Bobby," he
played a young man in 1968
called up to fight in Vietnam. And
in the "Iord of the Rings" trilogy,
Wood was the reluctant, hairy-foot-
ed center of the Fellowship formed
to strike a blow against Sauron and
save Middle Earth.
And now in "Day Zero," opening
Jan. 18, Wood is called up to fight a
new war. He's one of three friends
who get the dreaded - some might
say long-delayed - letter in the
near future where conflicts in Iraq,
Afghanistan and elsewhere have
prompted a reinstatement of con-
scription. Chris Klein costars asa young lawyer whose career is
flourishing stateside and can't see
zrny reason why he should have to
ship out, and Jon Bernthal is a cab-
bie who believes it's their duty to
go to combat fortheir country.
Wood plays a struggling novel-
ist trying to finish his first book in
30 days, and is frightened to death
both by the prospect of completing
his opus and showing up for a mil-
itary tour. With his pals, he shaves
his head, gets a tattoo, has wild
nights on the town and generally
does everything he can think of to
test himself and prepare for the or-
deal. The last detail to tend to, nat-
urally, will be surviving.
