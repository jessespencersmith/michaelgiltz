 Jonas Brothers Movie A Disaster!
I Mean, A Smash!
Read More:  Concert Film, Jonas Brothers , Miley Cyrus.
Madonna , Movie Box Office , Pop Music , u2, Entertainment News
The Jonas Brothers 3D concert film opened this
weekend to $12.7 million.  Some people casually
mentioned that this was the second biggestopening weekend of all time for a concert film.But most were like Billboard, which said, "JonasBrothers 3D Film Falls Flat"  or the New York
Times , which declared the  Jonas Brothers are no
Miley Cyrus.
But here's the truth: with their opening weekend
total, the  Jonas Brothers movie became the third
highest grossing concert film OF ALL TIME.
That's right. This "flop" has scored bigger at the box office in one weekend than concert films byU2, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin, Talking Heads, Neil Young, N Sync and countlessothers did during their entire run. Even having a concert film get released in movie theaters isunusual. The number one grossing concert film of all time is by Miley Cyrus (featuring...the JonasBrothers) which grossed $65 million. #2 (for the moment) is Madonna: Truth Or Dare,  a
concert/documentary that grossed $15 million. By next weekend, the Jonas Brothers will have thesecond biggest grossing concert film of all time.
So questions about why it wasn't bigger are
a tad crazy. But here's why it wasn't bigger.
Miley Cyrus toured for three and a half
months, with a ticket frenzy surroundingevery stop. (Her opening act for most of thetour? The Jonas Brothers.) In comparison,the Jonas Brothers toured for most of 2009and sold almost 1 million tickets. There wasno crazed, pent-up demand to see them inconcert the way there was for Miley Cyrus.And yet they still had an opening weekend

So don't say the Jonas Brothers fell flat. Say
that Hollywood still finds it remarkably
difficult to predict the movie-going habits
of teenage girls. And don't let early
suggestions of massive box office taint a
smash hit concert film with the aura of a
flop. That would be like tagging any moviethat didn't match the grosses of Titanic  a
failure. Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert  is a huge success by any reasonable standard.

See Zorianna Kit's  interview with the Jonas Brothers here.
And read David Wild's witty comparison of a showdown between the Jonas Brothers and Scott
Walker here. Actually, the comparison isn't so strange, since the Walker Brothers were a huge hit
until Scott Walker broke off and released his baroque, increasingly insular solo albums. It would be
like Joe Jonas leaving the group and putting out ambient soundscapes on his own. Could still
happen....

I just can't care. I really can't.
I could care less about opening numbers or whatever. Legs on the other hand. Think anyone will still be
watching the boys ten years from now or The Song Remains the Same like it is now?
So, they should enjoy it while they can because they will be in Branson, MO before they know it playing
to overweight former groupies of theirs.

I actually do think their new album was a big step forward. It'sdefinitely on my list of the best 40+ albums of the year (covering allgenres, not just pop). So I wouldn't be surprised to see them (or Nickor Joe a la Justin Timberlake) continuing on and producing better andbetter music down the road.

So it's official. Miley's team is MUCH SMARTER than the people running the Jonas Bros. operation!
When her movie was released, Miley"s peeps claimed the movie would only run ONE weekend...
taking a page out of the Disney script ("see it now, before it get's locked in the vault!"). 
That brilliant marketing stroke got all the parents out and propelled her movie to #1. And lo and behold,
the movie kept playing! Gasp. 
In this economy, only a SEE IT OR MISS IT would get the parents out in droves. The boys should have
learned how to do it by watching Miley. It it"s ain"t broke  COPY IT!

That was Disney's call, not Miley's. And given the minimal box officefor concert films prior to her film and the competition they had forIMAX screens with U2 (which people assumed would be a biggerdraw in that format), it was a reasonable marketing ploy and workedgreat, especially given the dearth of tickets for her concert tour
making this a must-have for any parent with girls. HOWEVER, if Dinsey had tried toannounce the Jonas Brothers concert as a one-week only event, it would have been widelyderided and mocked as a cynical marketing ploy they would abandon come week two. Thebad press and such would have been overwhelming, tarnishing the JoBro name. Smartly,
they avoided that. The JoBro team is smart, though I think the upcoming TV series smacks of
overkill. They should keep the focus on their music (and a live action comedy directed by theFarrelly Brothers coming up is much smarter for branching out.) The TV show just seems likethe Naked brothers band after puberty.

I am a big Jonas fan...isn't the overkill kind of already here? Their press this week
has been abysmal. It's really too bad, I don't think they deserve it at all - towardstheir music or their personalities - but they can't seem to avoid press but for gettingthe worst kind. Strikes me as very unfair, but it's like an avalanche of popular adultopinion giving them thumbs down. Bummer.

Thanks so much for responding to my comment. You are 100%. I guess that was aone-off plan/ploy that worked well for Miley. You can only cry wolf once! Oh no, Ididn't know about a TV Series. Overkill to be sure! Believe me, I know. I am aMenudo-NKOTB-Nsync fan alum so I'm very familiar with the premature jump of theshark through overexposure. Again, thanks for your response. Your post was great
fun to read with all of the other news out there!
