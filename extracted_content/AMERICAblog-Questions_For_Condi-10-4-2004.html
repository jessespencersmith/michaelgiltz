10/04/2004 01:51:00 AMI missed Wolf Blitzer's grilling but thought George S. on ABC didmerely a so-so job of getting her off message and actually answeringthe many questions raised by the NYT article.1. The ever-changing number of troops that are "trained" or "fullytrained" or "kinda trained" is getting absurd. These people [Condi,Cheney, Bush]should be unable to walk out their doors without beinghounded with questions about a definitive answer on this questionand then immediately pounded with questions about why so many ofthem contradict each other and the Defense Department. To go from200,000 to 130,000 to 100,000 when the DD is testifying to Congressthat it's really about 50,000 and only 9,000 of those are fully trained(surely the only standard that matters if you're going to be askingthem to wage a war) is ridiculous.2. Condi was aware of the debate but not aware of its nature? Whythe hell not?3. More to the point: what debate? There was no debate. When everyexpert you speak to -- our top nuclear scientists, the StateDepartment, commissions, all our overseas allies, etc. -- says thetubes are NOT useful for centrifuges and ONE LONE minor CIA guysays they are, that's not a debate. That's a CONSENSUS. There wasNO debate. Everyone told them these tubes were for firing rockets.They ignored that, seized on the one person who would tell themwhat they wanted to hear and went to the American public and theworld and stated flatly without caveat that this was our trump card --tubes used only for nuclear bomb building. I remember Condi sayingwatch out for the mushroom cloud on national TV. And I took herseriously. And she lied.4. If she didn't lie, she was misled. Who misled her, who has beenfired and when will they be brought up on charges for endangeringnational security on lies?
