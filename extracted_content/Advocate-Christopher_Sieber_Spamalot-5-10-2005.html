T II B 4. II a 
Out Broadway hunk· Christopher Sieber is 
enjoying his biggest hit yet By Michael Giltz 
Christopher Sieber has been in 
hit musicals like Thoroughly 
Modern Millie and Beauty and 
the Beast (where he had a blast 
playing the manly Gaston and 
met his partner of five years, actor 
Kevin Burrows). He's also had the joy 
of a nightly showstopper, like his hilari­
ous number "Agony" in the critically ac­
claimed revival of Into the Woods. He 
even sang the occasional tune in his 
role as one of TV's first gay dads on 
ABC's sitcom It's AU Relative. 
But nothing compares to the head­
spirullng (and limb-chopping) experi­
ence of being in the megasmash 
Monty Python's Spamalot, which is 
packing them in with the lure of 
Python routines and a top-notch cast 
that also includes Tim Curry, David 
Hyde Pierce, Hank Azaria, and rising 
star Sara Ramirez. Sieber talked with 
The Advocate about what it's like to 
go from being an "ugly kid with no 
neck" to playing a dashing knight in 
the biggest hit in town. 
Let's cut to the chase. Can you get 
me tickets? 
[Laughs) This is my sweet revenge. 
Growing up in the Midwest as a gay 
kid, you're picked 011. This girl was in 
my seventh-grad e French class, and 
she would poke her pencils in the 
back of my neck and then put her lip­
stick in my hair, and then she'd spray 
me with perfume. Last weekend, who 
do I hear from but Amy from the 
seventh grade. And she asked for tick­
ets. I e-mailed her back, "Amy, there is 
no possible way I would get you tickets after 
the way you 
treated me." 
She hasn't re­
sponded yet. 
You really 
work your 
butt off in 
the show. 
My partner, 
Kevin, goes on­
line and people 
write, "Christo­
pher is wasted 
in this show 
because he's 
in the first act 
and then you 
don't see him 
until the fi­
nale." They don't read the Playbill! I 
play Sir Galahad. And in the second 
act I play the Black Knight, who has 
all his limbs chopped off. It's the most 
uncomfortable costume because of 
the special effects. For the first cou­
ple of weeks, I had bruises all over 
my body. But anything for a laugh. 
And then I play Prince Herbert's fa­
ther. He doesn't really have a name; 
I'll call him Josh. He's a big, disgust­
ing man, so that's about 45 pounds of 
costume. 
Everyone mentions your Andrew 
Lloyd Webber parody duet, '4Jhe 
Song That Goes Like This," with 
Sara Ramirez. 
It's very rare that you get to work with 
someone and see them become one of 
THE ADVOCATE 16G I MAY 10, 2005 the biggest stars on Broadway. Sara's 
on the verge of becoming something 
bigger than she can imagine. 
You've been in acclaimed musicals 
and performed great numbers that 
brought down the house. Is Spam­
alof really different? 
The day after we opened, coming to 
work and seeing the line go down the 
block-I've never been in a hit like this. 
People talk about the roar of the 
crowd, and I thought I knew what they 
meant, but I'd never heard it. At the 
curtain call, they're simply roaring. It's 
like a rock concert .•
