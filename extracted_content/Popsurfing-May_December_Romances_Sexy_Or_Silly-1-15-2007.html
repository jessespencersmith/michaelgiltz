            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 7May-December Romances -- Sexy Or SillyThe NYTimes has a piece on the current crush of movies depictingromances between much older and younger people. They talk a lotabout the difference between mutual attraction and someone being"stalked," but it all comes down to this old chliche -- the onlyrelationship they don't find "icky" is between an older woman (CateBlanchett) and a 15 year old boy. This of course is because everyone issupposed to think the young man is lucky to be "seduced" or "seduce"an older woman. An older man with a girl is gross, an older man with aboy is sick and an older woman with a younger woman is psychotic. Ithink they also delude themselves about "The History Boys" in thinkingwe're supposed to believe it's okay for the teacher Hector to fondle thenaughty bits of his students. The play and movie does flirt withcontroversy by saying that in this situation the lads might be takenadvantage of, but won't suffer life-long trauma because of it. (Not allmolestation is equal.) But it's very clear that Hector is condemned andseen as rather pathetic in this regard. Personally, I found theBlanchett/boy sex icky too but didn't find the mom and high schoolgardener scenes in "Desperate Housewives" off-putting at all. It may becrass to say so, but the acceptability of all of these different sexualscenarios may boil down to one simple thing: do you think either orboth of the people involved are desirable? If you do, it will seem onsome base level to be okay. If you don't, all the justification in the worldwon't make it seem right.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
