Playwright and best friend Paul Rudnick tells 
why he wouldn't miss the revival of Wendy 
Wasserstein's Uncommon Women and Oth­
ers opening October 26. 
"I've known Wendy since I was an undergradu­
ate at Yale. I did the props and Wendy played a 
French maid in a Feydeau farce. Even though 
she's gone on to win the Pulitzer, I must say, she 
played the maid astonishingly well, especially for 
a woman who I don't believe has ever cleaned a 
hotel room. 
"Wendy had a rough time at Yale. Back then, 
the vogue was for imitation Sam Shepard plays­
rugged male Western plays that were usually writ­
ten by some Jewish boy from 
Long Island. Wendy was 
treated as some oddball 
whose work would 
never last."</p>
