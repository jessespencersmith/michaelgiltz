THEATER: Ruben and Clay's Holiday TV Special
(Minus The Cameras)
RUBEN  AND  CLAY'S  FIRST  ANNUAL  CHRISTMAS  CAROL
FAMILY  FUN  PAGEANT  SPECTACULAR  REUNION  SHOW  **
out of ****
IMPERIAL  THEATER
Okay, if you have any interest in Ruben  and  Clay's  First  Annual
Christmas  Carol  Family  Fun  Pageant  Spectacular  Reunion  Show,  by
all means go ahead! If you're on the fence, one has to wonder why? Are
you worried they won't sing enough Christmas songs or make enoughAmerican  Idol  references or deliver enough groan-worthy jokes? Fear
not! If you're asking yourself, who are Ruben and Clay, well then thisprobably isn't for you. Unless that is, you're a tourist and you'd like togo to a Broadway show but don't want to spend $200 and you'vealready seen the Rockettes and you're in town and apparently
Hamilton  tickets are really hard to get (who knew?) and you just want
a break from walking in which case, I think you're in luck!
This is the second year in a row someone has plopped a TV-centric
holiday show onto Broadway, but this time it's actually more of a
present for tourists instead of a trap. That earlier show included
winners of The  Voice,  America's  Got  Talent  and the like, which is to
say shows that aren't American  Idol.  And we all know American  Idol
is the talent show that has actually discovered talent in recent years:Oscar-winning, Grammy-winning and (eventually) Tony-winning
talent. (Constantine Maroulis was nominated for a Tony Award in
2009 for Rock  Of  Ages  and Fantasia deserved a nomination when she
stepped into The  Color  Purple. )  Heck, Clay Aiken already appeared on
Broadway during the run of Spamalot . So this isn't even his Broadway
debut!
Have you guessed that I'm a fan of American  Idol?  Toss in the factMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>that I own a ridiculous amount of Christmas music AND I enjoy
good/bad holiday specials of yore and you can imagine I am the
perfect audience member for  Ruben  and  Clay's  First  Annual
Christmas  Carol  Family  Fun  Pageant  Spectacular  Reunion  Show.  
Clay Aiken promises right at the top of the show that it will bemodeled after those Bing Crosby/Perry Como/Partridge Familyholiday specials and Ruben Studdard insists that means a very cheesyvibe. Mission accomplished! The medleys are so non-stop, the gags so
dad-worthy, the skits and sentimentality so on-cue that I looked in
vain for the TV cameras. It's not especially good. And it's   not so-bad-
it's good. It's just what it is -- a holiday special with two guys who roseto fame together via one of the most-watched TV showdowns of alltime, enjoyed some success on their own and genuinely don't mind
being joined at the hip even 15 years later. They don the same duds
they wore for their Idol  audition, Clay keeps trying to get his name
listed first in the show's title, Ruben kids him about being the runner-up and if any of this makes you roll your eyes, well that's the point.
It all slips by painlessly, though not as fast as it should. Act One wasThe Movies, Books, Theater,

<p>heavier on the jokes -- including an admirably timely rewrite of "Baby
It's Cold Outside." I especially enjoyed the goofy, Laugh-In  style series
of one liners. Actors stuck their heads through the curtain a la that
variety show to deliver zingers. The winning gag for my group: "What
does Santa Claus use to clean his sleigh? Comet!" Act Two was moreserious, with the two leads each sharing videotaped memories ofChristmas amidst a showcased ballad, then bringing tears to their eyes
when they chatted about their friendship.
The supporting cast of three women and two men did a lot of heavy
lifting on this nonsense. Saddled with bland material, they did theirjob and stayed out of the way of Clay and Ruben. Julian Diaz-
Granados made the most of his chance, delivering the best vocals, the
right goofy (but not dismissive) attitude to the nonsense and CW-ready looks (he should soon book a comedy or at least a guest spot onRiverdale ).
The whole thing looks like it cost about $5, which actually helps -- the
flimsier the material, the more a hometown, just-doing-it-for-fun vibe
let's you feel supportive, the way one might at a school production. Thenight I attended they were gifted with a very  eager audience member
chosen to come on stage for a game of word association. Her hijinksalone raised the spirits (and I hate audience participation). Still, attwo hours and ten minutes, it's easily 20 minutes too long. For
starters, a PSA for the worthy charity Inclusion Project  unnecessarily
began act two. (They work to integrate kids with disabilities anywhere
and everywhere and a portion of proceeds benefit them.) The videoshould have been displayed during the intermission. Then, cut one
medley from each act, cut the jarring joke about Ruben using a
bathroom installed in the set's chimney and maybe one or two of theirheart-tugging videos and voila, you've just improved things mightily.(The only other joke that doesn't work is having Ruben flatly reject one
of the cast members as a date right at the start. Her interest in a
boyfriend is a very minor thread, but why shoot her down at thebeginning or do it so coldly?)
If you'll notice, I haven't mentioned the music. What's to say? By and
large, the medleys and arrangements are unmemorable and
uninspired, if competent. The exception, unfortunately, is when Rubentackles one of my favorite holiday songs: Stevie Wonder's "One LittleChristmas Tree." Here music director Ben Cohn gets in the way of thesong (and Ruben's singing) with a clunky arrangement. In terms of
voice, I'd say Ruben's smooth vocals have risen a bit over the years
(rather than lowered) and hold up better than Clay's. Of course, Claystill hits the Olympian heights, which sent the crowd I saw the showwith into ecstasy. And Clay is far more comfortable onstage, banteringwith the audience, delivering the goofy lines and setting the right tone.
Ruben is so laid back he almost disappears at times, though he notably
wakes up during a brief bit imitating a preacher to introduce one ofClay's showcases. (His dry wit comes across better on video.)</p>
<p>You can't complain all this is corny because Ruben beats you to it. Yet
their chemistry come across nicely here, from the opening gags to their
final duet on a Christmas standard that ends the night on a touch offaith...and another big, big note from Clay. Hey, they know their
audience. Whether that audience is big enough to bring them back
for 
Ruben  and  Clay's  Second  Annual  Christmas  Carol  Family  Fun
Pageant  Spectacular  Reunion  Show,  only time (and the box office)
will show. It's doubtful. But if American  Idol  wants to extend its brand
to a holiday special (and why not?) they've got the perfect hosts.
