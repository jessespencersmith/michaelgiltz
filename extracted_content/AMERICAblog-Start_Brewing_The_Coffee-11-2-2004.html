11/02/2004 11:24:00 PMIt's gonna be a long night. Our dream of an electoral college surpriseand a major sweep in that category look unlikely. But it's great to seeKerry breathing down Bush's neck. We can still look forward to anelectoral college victory and hopefully a popular vote victory that ismore resounding. But Florida and Ohio look really tricky as far asgetting the results tonight: in Florida, the Republican electionsupervisor estimates it will be THURSDAY before they can count allthe absentee ballots. Similar delays might occur in Ohio. That's a lotof coffee.
