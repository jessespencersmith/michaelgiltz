What We Say
In this solid debut, author Ian Stansel crosses the Biblical tale of Cain vs Abel with the classic Western. But it's set in
modern times and involves two brothers who become self-made successes in the competitive world of trainers -- the menand women who battle each other for students they can coach to blue ribbons and even on to Olympic gold. Frank and Silas
have always fought and feuded...but they've also worked well together, building on their dad's stables and becoming big
players in the world of horsemanship. In many ways, they feel like the last cowboys. But when this trim novel begins, Frankis dead, Silas is on the run cross country on his beloved horse Disco and Frank's wife Lena is in hot pursuit for some old timeShare This Book

<p>justice. We flash back and forth from the present (where Silas feels his oats as an "outlaw" that can scare anyone who has
seen the local headlines) to the past, where the two brothers grow up and grow apart. This is a clean, clear, purposeful
book that satisfies on multiple levels, especially in showing how the battle between siblings ultimately isn't about anything
more than the accident of birth. Like an Anthony Mann film, it's no-nonsense, to the point and better for it. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Written with the headlong pace of the cross-country manhunt it describes, The Last Cowboys of San Geronimo
fuses the classic Cain-and-Abel tale with the gripping tension of a modern revenge thriller. From the groomed
world of equestrian eventing to the tough mountain trails of Northern California, Ian Stansel sends a resilient
horsewoman in blood-hot pursuit of personal justice, and at the same time shows us that the redemptive
partnership of horse and rider can transcend even the most bitter of animosities."
—Malcolm Brooks, author of Painted Horses
“With his debut novel, The Last Cowboys of San Geronimo , Ian Stansel confidently updates the American
Western while honoring its most daring storytellers: Charles Portis and Larry McMurtry. In taut, cinematic prose,
Stansel considers the romance of frontier justice, the seductive power of a good old-fashioned horsechase/manhunt and the heartbreaking costs of fraternal rivalry. For me, the true star of The Last Cowboys of
San Geronimo  is Lena Van Loy, a stoic horsewoman who emerges as a fearless rider, a clear-headed tracker and
a compassionate but avenging wife. With plenty of true grit,…
