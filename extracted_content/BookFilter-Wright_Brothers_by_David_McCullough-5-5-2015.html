Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayBest-selling, acclaimed historian David McCullough is in solid form on his biography of The Wright Brothers. Withclear, lucid prose, he tells the story of the two men who revolutionized man-powered aviation. One surprise for thosewho like me don't know much more than Kitty Hawk is how hard it was for the Wright brothers to convince the worldwhat they'd accomplished long AFTER their historic flight. The nutters and dreamers with hare-brained schemeswere widespread. Even government-backed projects at the Smithsonian fell flat. Major scientists had declaredgenuine machine-powered flight was mathematically impossible. And then the Wright brothers did it. They're oddducks, actually, never marrying, sober, modest and focused on their work. Mama's boys, you'd call them, if theirmama hadn't died when they were young. Various mysteries remain -- Wilbur's three-year retreat from the world as ayoung man after a local bully attacked him, Orville's feelings of deep betrayal when his sister finally married late in life-- but their great accomplishment is illuminated. They flew and flew again and again. McCullough captures theirfrustrations, their accomplishments and their ultimate wowing of the world with economy and grace. It's a narrowlyfocused work and the brothers are so impenetrable that this won't rank as among his best. But it's popular history ofthe best sort. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
