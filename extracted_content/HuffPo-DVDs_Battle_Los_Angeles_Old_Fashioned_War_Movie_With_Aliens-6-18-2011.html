<p>BATTLE: LOS ANGELES  ($28.96 regular or $38.96 BluRay; Sony) -- Hoo-rah! You get absolutely no
points for predicting any of the plot twists or the gung-ho finale of this enjoyable B movie. It's a by-the-
numbers war movie and well served by not trying to be anything more than that. Aaron Eckhart is the
battle-scarred veteran who is ready to clock out after 20 years. If nothing else, he's haunted by the
memory of his last time in battle, when he lost all the men under his command, for which he received a
medal and a lifetime of guilt and pain. But wouldn't you know it? Just as he's set to retire, a bunch of
aliens decide to attack Earth, forcing Eckhart to join another group of soldiers including a green
commander straight out of military school, a dorky virgin from down on the farm, a bad-ass woman(Michelle Rodriguez) and the bitter, suspicious brother of one of the men Eckhart lost. Their mission isto rescue some civilians trapped at a police station and get them away from the coastline before the AirForce gets all medieval on the aliens.
Like a good drive-in movie, Battle: Los Angeles  does a clever job of introducing world-wide attacks via
TV news reports that make the story seem epic even if we stay close in on this one group of soldiers. Plus,
for quite a while the aliens are glimpsed in brief flashes or lost in the shadows of some smoke to keep
them both mysterious and less expensive. I was exactly in the right mood for this movie, which features
some smart "John Wayne" action from our hero as he wins the grudging respect of his fellow soldiers.The finale is so fist-pumping and manly you'll be headed towards the nearest recruitment center beforeyou know it. Eckhart does a fine job as a square-jawed soldier, even when he's saddled with lines like"Marines don't cry" and a hoary call to arms. Fun stuff as long as you don't expect a whit more thanthey're going to give you.
DAS BOOT COLLECTOR'S SET  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony) -- From pretty good B movie to a genuinely
great film. Das Boot  is a modern classic about Germans involved in submarine warfare during World War
II. It's a tense, thrilling film of combat and also deeply moving. This BluRay contains the 2 1/2 hourfeature film version and the 3 1/2 hour director's cut, which includes more footage used in a Germanminiseries version. It's great to have the original theatrical cut here; you'll wince and shiver over everysingle ping and pop during the underwater games of cat and mouse. Director Wolfgang Petersen nevercame within a mile of this ever again.

<p>richest films ever made. Films like that don't come out of nowhere so it's no surprise he has a strong
filmography. Nanette  is a sad, minimalist look at an orangutan who has spent most of her life in a Paris
zoo. You'll either be bored by its unflinching focus on her or roused to free any and all creatures fromcaptivity. It's paired with Animals & More Animals,  a look at the stuffed animals at the Paris Natural
History Museum being brought out of storage. American audiences can also catch up with Louvre City,  a
day in the life of the museum that focuses on its workers and how it operates; In The Land Of The Deaf;and Every Little Thing  (all $24.95 each; Kino), which examines the members of a psychiatric clinic who
mount a stage production every year. Clearly, Philibert is a major documentary filmmaker who deservesto rank alongside the best.
SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT 2011 3-D EXPERIENCE  ($19.95; Sony) -- I don't have a 3-D
compatible TV so I glanced at this in 2-D but the models seemed pretty darn curvy to me. The womenchat away about what an honor it is to be included and how you can't really define beauty (this whilerolling around on the sand in a bikini) but it proves just as pretty with the sound off. Why get just themagazine when you can get this? Maui, by the way, looks amazing. Yes, I noticed the background.
SHOT IN THE DARK  ($19.98; HBO) -- Actor Adrian Grenier's heartfelt exploration of fatherhood and
his attempt to reconnect with his biological dad comes out just in time for Father's Day. Extras include
updated interviews with the people involved done via Skype along with unreleased footage.
HAIR
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT
NEW YORK, NEW YORK  ($19.99 each; MGM) -- Three musicals come to BluRay. Hair  always
seemed like an artifact of its era but the recent Broadway revival has given it new life. If you can't catch
the show when it returns to New York City this summer, check out the DVD. Priscilla  is also on
Broadway as a new musical, which is no surprise since this heartwarming comic drama was practically amusical in the first place. Only Martin Scorsese's New York, New York  has failed to make it to the Great
White Way, but don't count it out yet -- it does have one of the greatest 11 O'clock numbers of them allwhen Liza Minelli belts out "New York, New York" at the end, the title song written specifically for thisfilm by Kander and Ebb. Can you believe it wasn't even nominated for the Oscar? Amazing.
BEST GAY SHORTS VOL 1/BEST LESBIAN SHORTS VOL 1  ($24.95 each; First Run Features) --
Many minorities tell their stories via film shorts -- they're cheaper and easier to make on your own when
the mainstream media refuses to represent you. But even though LGBT storylines have taken root in TV,
film, theater and books to a tremendous degree, their stories continue to be made into short films at ahigher rate than most other minorities and they certainly get seen in commercial movie houses moreoften. I'm not quite sure why this is so, but it seems true to me. Hence these collections of shorts fromaround the world, seen at film festivals or on TV, ranging from the poem-like adaption of a DennisCooper work called simply "After" to the Twilight Zone -twists of "Steam" in Gay Shorts and a similar
range in the lesbian shorts collection.
KORKORO  ($29.95; Lorber Films) -- Dirctor Tony Gatlif avoids his usual formula of a Romany tale
ending in an ecstatic musical eruption by delving into this period piece about the people then persecuted
as Gypsies trying to avoid capture in Nazi-occupied France. A welcome change of pace for him.
HALL PASS  ($28.98 regular or $35.99 BluRay; New Line) -- The Farrelly Brothers have become so
passe their movies aren't even notable anymore as flops or successes. (This one made $83 million
worldwide, but who would have known?) They just come and go, like this would-be tale of woe about two

RED RIDING HOOD  ($28.98 regular and $35.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- Director Catherine
Hardwicke of Twilight  sexes up the violent fairy tale about Little Red Riding Hood in this critical
disappointment. This DVD contains an alternate ending, video commentary and glimpses of various
auditions.
SHOESHINE  ($19.98; E One) -- Italian director Vittorio De Sica is best known for The Bicycle Thief
and perhaps Umberto D  by U.S. audiences. They should know Shoeshine  as well, which tells the story of
two boys tossed into juvenile detention with such heartbreak that the Academy Awards gave it a special
statue in 1947 almost a decade before it began naming a Best Foreign Film of the year award.
THE LONG RIDERS  ($19.99 BluRay; MGM) -- A passion project of actor Stacy Keach who starred,
worked on the script and was an executive producer, this Western gets a footnote for casting real-life
brothers as brothers in the film, notably Randy and Dennis Quaid, Christipher and Nicholas Guest, Stacy
and James Keach and not one, not two but three Carradines. Director Walter Hill does his usual balletic
presentation of violence in this somber affair about the James-Younger gang. Good stuff.
BHUTTO  ($27.95; First Fun Features) -- As Pakistan continues to make headlines in countless
frustrating and complex ways, it's worth taking a look at this documentary about the late Benazir Bhutto,
a woman embroiled in corruption, the daughter of privilege and yet perhaps that country's best hope fora time at genuine democracy instead of the military dictatorship it suffers under today. Gripping, no-holds-barred, this film captures Bhutto and her country in all their complexity.
