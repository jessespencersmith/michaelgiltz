Actor Michael Boatman naviga s the gay 
subplots in ABC's hit sitcom. 
SPIN CITY-the Michael]. Fox sitcom 
Tuesday nights on ABC that is the TV 
season's one unqualified new hit-is in the 
midst of taping its gay marriage episode on a 
Manhattan soundstage. Fittingly, it's 
ational Coming Out Day. "Do you know 
what that is?" asks the stand-up comic who 
keeps the audience entertained between 
scenes, looking at an elderly visitor from 
Canada. The man shakes his head no. Well, 
by the end of the taping, he knows. 
The plot unfolds: Gay activist and 
mayoral adviser Carter Heywood, played by 
Michael Boatman, decides to protest his 
boss' stand against same-sex marriage by 
wedding Nikki, a female co-worker and 
friend, during a carefully coordinated media 
circus. Shocking? Not to this studio audience 
of New Yorkers and tourists (including Fox's 
elementary school teacher), which laughs at all the right places. 
"When people tell me that things aren't changing, that things are as 
bad as they were in the '30S and '40S, I think, 'You have no perspective,'" 
"When people tell me that 
things aren't changing, I think, 
'You have no perspective .'" says Boatman later. "I was standing up there 
doing that [marriage] scene and I was thinking, 
'Wait a minute. Hello? We're not even dealing 
with the fact that this is a white woman 
marrying a black man. ot once is it mentioned 
in the episode, and no one has even mentioned it during the production of 
it.' And I thought that was great." 
Boatman---a ro-year acting vet best known for his role on ABC's China 
Beach, as well as the lead in the feature film The 
Glass Shield--says he jumped at the chance to 
play Carter. A new father with his wife of four 
years, the actor bases his portrayal on a close 
friend who attended an Ivy League school and 
joined a fraternity before realizing he was gay. 
Unlike Boatman, Carter is single, but that 
will change. "They said he'll be in a 
relationship," reveals the actor. "In one scene I 
had with Michael]. Fox, I talked about how I 
had been too busy at one point to have a live-in 
boyfriend. I liked that idea because it painted a 
picture of Carter and his drive and passion for what he does. But another 
part of me said, 'OK, but that can't last forever."'-MlcHAEL GILTZ
