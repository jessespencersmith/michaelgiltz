            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  O C TO B E R  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6Enough With The ListsI love lists. Who doesn't? I even owned and read The Book of Listsonce. And I don't mind if any publication takes the time to come upwith a list. If The Weekly Standard does a list of top Washingtonscandals, fine. If The Christian Science Monitor does an annual hot listof top saints, great. What I can't handle is OTHER media outletstreating these lists as if they're news. The BBC -- a rather august newsorganization, don't you think? -- has a headline saying "'GoodFellas'Named Greatest Movie." Makes sense to me: it's certainly the Scorsesemovie I've watched the most and while "Raging Bull" is right there withit, let's be frank and admit it's pretty punishing (in a good way) andthat "GoodFellas" is its equal in almost every way. But who said? TheAFI? The BFI? Is it time for that every-five-years poll of film criticsaround the world? Nope, it's a list compiled by Total Film magazine.No, I've never heard of them either and I read a lot of British magazinesand go to the UK regularly. It's not even Empire, for heaven's sake. Is alist by the un-august Total Films magazine really worth reporting on bythe BBC? I don't think so. But it's not as bad as the list the BBC covereda week earlier. This one was a list of the Top 100 "landmark" filmswhich included -- rightly, given the criteria they set forth -- "DeepThroat." And who made this list? The Radio Times. THE RADIOTIMES. Because no one knows movies like a magazine covering radio.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
