3/26/2005 01:12:00 AMWow. WOW! This is literally out of control. The Miami Heraldhas numerous sources confirming that Jeb Bush was sending inthe troops -- ignoring the rule of law, the Supreme Court andthe opinion of the vast majority of Americans -- to in effectdelcare martial law and seize Terri Schiavo. (Thanks to bloggerAndrew A. Gill for the heads-up on this one.)Think about this.Top far-right religious leaders told Jeb Bush he shouldn't bepushed around by some "piddling judge." Anne Coulter shoutedthey should send in the National Guard. Silly talk-radio/FoxNews rhetoric? Jeb Bush damn near did it. And if the bravemen and women of the local police hadn't decided to upholdthe law, Bush would have succeeded."Hours after a judge ordered that Terri Schiavowas not to be removed from her hospice, a teamof state agents were en route to seize her andhave her feeding tube reinserted -- but theystopped short when local police told them theywould enforce the judge's order, The Herald haslearned," reports the Miami Herald."Agents of the Florida Department of LawEnforcement told police in Pinellas Park, the smalltown where Schiavo lies at Hospice Woodside, onThursday that they were on the way to take herto a hospital to resume her feeding."For a brief period, local police, who have officersat the hospice to keep protesters out, preparedfor what sources called ``a showdown.''"In the end, the squad from the FDLE and theDepartment of Children & Families backed down,apparently concerned about confronting localpolice outside the hospice," all per the MiamiHerald's ground-breaking coverage.Do we live in some pathetic dictatorship now wherejudges who don't "cooperate" are threatened and theirfamilies are murdered and the rule of law is a joke?This has nothing to do anymore with what decisions youor I or anyone make at the end of their lives. This has todo with a far-right minority deciding they want todismantle our form of government, attack theindependent judiciary until it is weak, and encourage agovernor to send in the troops.This is outrageous. The mere fact that Jeb Bush couldeven CONSIDER such a move is outrageous. There needto be Congressional hearings, Bush needs to be censuredby the Congress if this proves accurate and a respect forthis country's laws needs to be instilled again in ourpeople. This isn't even mob rule, since most Americans
