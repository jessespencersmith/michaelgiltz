Tom Felton at the New York
"Deathly Hallows" premiere.(Andrew Gombert / EuropeanPressphoto Agency)‘Harry Potter’ countdown: Tom Felton’s
tattoo prank leads our NYC premierediary
Nov. 16, 2010  | 6:25 p.m.
A MONTH OF MAGIC: Hero Complex  is counting down to the Nov. 19 release of “ Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 1 ” — the penultimate film in the history-making
“Potter” franchise — with exclusive interviews, photos, videos and reports from the set. Today,
Michael Giltz gives us a black-carpet diary from his coverage of the New York premiere
Monday at the newly revamped Lincoln Center.
DRACO’S EVIL PLAN : He’s nowhere as sinister as
Draco Malfoy , but Tom Felton does have a
mischievous side. That’s why he planted a rumor far and
wide that he and other “Potter” cast members weregetting the same tattoo, a la the crew of “ The Lord of
the Rings .” The prank worked, with Rupert Grint ,
Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe  suddenly
bombarded with questions about what tattoo they would
be getting and where. “I suggested a lightning bolt on the
left buttock,” Felton said. “I think it would be ratherfetching. Daniel and Emma beg to differ.” Then he mimeddropping his pants before smiling and moving on downthe red carpet. Whatever happens to his career, Felton isclearly confident and ready to have fun. He played rightalong when I suggested Daniel Radcliffe was imitatinghim: Felton has a ghost story project, “ The
Apparition ,” and Radcliffe has announced he’ll star in
the new Hammer film “ The Woman in Black ,” based
on the smash hit play that’s also a ghost story. “It’s sad,really,” Felton said with a wink.
GRINT’S GRIMACE: If anyone seems to feel they’re justlucky to be along for the ride, it’s Grint, who is – likeeveryone else in the cast and crew – unfailingly polite butstill seems a little out of his element in the media storm.Asked about his other recent film,  ”Wild Target ,” (with
fellow “Potter” alum Bill Nighy ), in which he plays an
inept aspiring hit man, Grint practically moaned when
asked if he was better at gunplay or Quidditch. “I’m quite
similarly bad at both,” he says. “I’ll take Quidditch.” Grint

Daniel Radcliffe at the New Yorkalso said he’d try not  to tear up again as the finality of the
franchise farewell sinks in. “I’ve vowed to stay strong thistime,” he says. “That day was just really weird. It just feltreally final. I remember cleaning out my dressing room and
finding toys I brought for my first film rehearsal. To think
how long I’ve been there, this is crazy. It’s going to take awhile for me to kind of get over it and move on.”
RAIDER OF THE LOST ART:  Producer David Barron,
who was a key player on six of the eight “Harry Potter”
films, has a resume that began when he was a production manager on such classic fare as “ The
Princess Bride ” and Jim Henson’s TV series “ The Storyteller .” But Barron says helping to
steer one of the most successful franchises in movie history has not been his biggest challenge.
That honor goes to the George Lucas TV series “ The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles .”
“Yeah,” says Barron when asked if it was the perfect training ground for this project. “Obviously,being a TV series, even though it’s very well-funded for a TV series, it was still very ambitiousand we filmed all over the world on very tight schedules with very ambitious material. It was
tricky. It was very difficult.”
DAVID AND DAVID AND DAVID : With Barron, producer David Heyman and (on the last
four films) director David Yates , there are certainly a lot of Davids on hand. “It’s so confusing;
I can’t tell you,” said David Yates, who had a great decade thanks to these films and theacclaimed TV miniseries “ State of Play ,” with a laugh. “Fortunately, the other two stay off the
set most of the time,” Yates said, playfully. “They come down when necessary, but most of thetime they’re up in the office playing cards.”
MY DEAR WATSON: Watson   jumped at the chance to get a
Mia Farrow -esque pixie haircut when shooting was over and
is attending Brown University.  She has shown a strong
interest in fashion and a million other areas. “I’d like to be awriter, I’d like to be an artist, I’d like to be a singer,” saysWatson, when asked what’s up next for her. She’s keeping busywith some assigned reading for school: “I’m reading Robert
Self ,” she says, referring to an associate professor of history at
Brown, “his writing on culture and politics in the U.S. since
1945. It’s interesting; it’s good.”
WILD ABOUT HARRY:
Radcliffe has worked hardon his acting, boldlytackling stage dramas like“Equus” and next
spring’s Broadway revival of “ How To Succeed In
Business Without Really Trying. “  He was the last
one from the film to make his way down the black carpetbut plenty of people asked about the tattoo. “I keephearing about it too,” says Radcliffe. “None of us havespoken about it. If a couple of other people get it first, I’llhave it.”   As a publicist tugs on his shoulder, we toss out aCurse of the Spider-Man? Fourth

few more quick queries, finding out (as he’s probablyrepeated over and over) that Radcliffe saved a pair ofglasses from the first movie and a pair from the last one.  
And how does he feel as the series reaches its end? “It’sbeen an amazing 10 years,” Radcliffe says. “I am … over-brimming with gratitude.”
