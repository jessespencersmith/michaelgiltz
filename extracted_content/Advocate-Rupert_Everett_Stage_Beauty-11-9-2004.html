            <p>upert Everett is suddenly 
on a roll. He voices the 
foppish, hair-tossing 
Prince Channing in Shrek 
2, the biggest hit of the 
year and the top-grossing 
animated film of all time. 
(It comes out on DVD on 
November 5, joining the just-released 
special edition of his breakthrough 1984 
film, Another Country.) The out actor is 
also on-screen in the key role of a cross­
dressing King Charles II in the current o car hopeful Stage Beauty, with Billy 
and Claire Danes. 
Soon, Everett will join Emily Watson 
Tom Wilkinson in Separate Lives, 
dir ctorial debut of Oscar-winning 
Pa?"k screenwriter Julian Fel-lowes, and will reunite with Another 
Country's director on A Different Loyal­
ty, with Sharon Stone. There's also that 
MIA Russian epic he made with the leg­
endary Sergei Bondarchuk (War and 
Peace), and he voices the role of the Fox 
in the anticipated blockbuster The 
Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the 
Witch, and the Wardrobe. 
Is it any wonder Everett's exhausted 
when he arrives spot on-time for a chat at a 
restaurant in Manhattan's West Village, 
where he currently lives? Everett, who's 
greeted in Italian by the staff, who know 
him on sight, is very polite and quite com­
fortable and candid. Maybe it's that sec­
ond declared bankruptcy. "It's tremen­
dously releasing," he assures The Advocate. 
"I can't advise it too strongly." ~ 
THE ADVOCATE 1471 NOVEMBER 9, 2004</p>
<p>Do you like politics? 
Yes, very much. 
I don't know how you feel about Tony Blair. 
We wanted him to be our president at first. 
Blair is a mystery. I think God plays a 
role in this whole thing. I was talking to 
my mum the other day, who is a 
staunch Republican . We were having 
one of those mother-son arguments 
about politics that don't go anywhere. I 
said, "What do you think George Bush 
and God talked about that time when 
George Bush asked about going into 
Iraq? Mummy, do you really think God 
said, 'Yes, you should go and lop off 
some Iraqis?' " And my mum went, 
"Well, you never know. He's a very 
funny man, God." My father is slig1rtly to the right of Mussolini. 
My mother is slightly to the right of 
Imelda Marcos. 
But not as many shoes? 
No. 
In Stage Beauty, you play your own son, which 
is fun. [Everett plays Charles II, while in the 
2003 British film To Kill a King he played 
Charles I, that monarch's doomed father.] 
That was really fun, playing the son of 
a father in Stage Beauty. That was 
what I liked most, because in the cate­
gory of your own work, that's kind of a 
fun thing to do. Also, to play scenes 
where you're talking about your father 
and you're imagining yourself-it's 
great. For someone who is not a 
Method actor, I thought it was about 
as methodical as I could possibly get. 
Now you have to play eromwe., who beheaded 
Charles I. I know you went to Cathok school. 
Did you practice, or are you practicing? 
Am I a practicing Catholic? No, I'm a 
practicing Buddhist. 
THE ADVOCATE 148 I NOVEMBER 9, 2004 Not even for your mother at Christmas? 
Yes, I do [go to church then], and I love 
Christianity. But the Catholic Church 
and Christianity in general I find unsatis­
factory, because since the third century 
they've been hijacked by neocons. If you 
look at Christianity before the third cen­
tury, you discover a very different thing. 
You were on the cover of The Advocate in 
January 1998, and you didn't seem interest­
ed in carrying the gay banner and saying, 
"I'm the out gay actor, and other people 
should come out too." But is there any 
disappointment that there haven't been 
more people coming out? 
Well, selfishly, less is more for me, 
right? [Laughs] 
You get to be the gay actor. "Get me 
Rupert!" 
I don't think it's something I'd advise. 
Really? 
Not in show business. Not in a trophy 
business like Hollywood. I don't think 
it's ideal. I think it's very lucky for ~</p>
<p>e 0 v e r s tor , 
me to have been English and to have 
the opportunities to work in all the var­
ious different places that I could so I 
could keep going. French cinema, Ital­
ian cinema, theater, English movies, 
and getting a Hollywood one if I can. I 
think if I had been an American .. .it's 
definitely not a ... a ... friendly environ­
ment, really. I don't want to particular­
ly elaborate on that. 
Do you wish you hadn't done it? 
No. I have a very old-fashioned way of 
thinking about the business and my 
career. I thought when I started out 
that your life was kind of it. All the ac­
tors I saw and loved from the '50s and 
the '60s were people who stretched 
their lives out li ke a bodybuilder 
stretches muscles out. 
Richard Burton? 
Oh, yeah. The hell-raisers; not my fa­
vorite one. But Marlon Brando, Vivien 
Leigh. You saw the madness of Vivien 
Leigh in every frame of her films. 
Montgomery Clift. Not wearing your 
heart on your sleeve-it was all part of 
one thing, your life and your work. It's 
part of your expression. It's a different 
business now. Now, the relationship 
between actor and audience has 
changed substantially . When you think 
of On the Waterfront and 
imagine working America 
going to the cinema on the 
weekend and seeing this god. 
This god but almost, almost 
like them and talking about 
their problems. When he said, 
"I coulda been a contender," 
you can imagine what the at­
mosphere across the screen 
and into the audience was. It 
was a communion . You came 
out of that theater and back to 
whatever your life was. You 
could get a lot of things out of it. You 
could analyze your own life through a 
great piece of writing. You could com­
fort your own life. Montgomery Clift in 
A Place in the Sun. The relationship 
between spectator and star was much 
more profound then. 
Clift and Eizabeth Taylor were the two most 
beautiful people in the wor1d at that moment 
Yes. But now none of the characters 
in mainstream cinema are realistic. 
They're all about what we want peo-pIe to be or what a Republican pre­
tending to be a Democrat in Holly­
wood wants. Look at Tom Cruise in 
Mission: Impossible. It's not a charac­
ter. What the audience wants is a kind 
of love-hate thing. They want the hair, 
the teeth, the ass, the body, the 
money, the girlfriend-they know 
they can't have it but they look, 
steamed-up against the window like 
Dickensi an children, at what they 
can't have. And it's a very, very scary 
kind of fandom. I noticed it particular-
THE ADVOCATE 150 I NOVEMBER 9, 2004 ly when we were premiering Shrek 2 
at Cannes. At Cannes, you drive in 
cars very slowly through the crowds. 
And it's really scary because the 
crowd is ... there's love and hate in 
there. Really, there's a very conflicted 
emotional response. Sometimes it's, 
"Who is it? Who is it?" Someone will 
at Cannes get out a gun and shoot 
someone because the relationship be­
tween a spectator and what they're 
watching has really changed. I think 
it's because we're not putting out the</p>
<p>kind of work that's telling us 
about ... we're not holding up a mirror 
in show business to the real world. 
The question was, Could you come out in 
Hollywood and playa heterosexual hero? 
And the answer was, Of course, as long as 
he was animated. 
Right. 
If people came to you today and said they 
wanted a Hollywood career-
I wouldn't come out then. 
You wouldn't encourage them to come out? 
No, definitely not. Have electroshock 
treatment. [Laughs] You'd do much 
better. 
It always seems to us that the U.K. is so 
much better for gays, and then some 
artists say the U.S. is better-not for your 
career, but for life. 
I don't know. I was thinking about 
this because I thought you might ask. 
I don't know what it's like in the 
workplace in general if you're gay. I 
think maybe soon we'll get to a 
point-maybe-where all the divi­
sions between us that make us all 
different types of human beings, 
maybe we'll grow out of that. We're 
so insecure as human beings, is how 
it feels to me. 
I'm too insecure to do drag. I wouldn't even 
do it for Halloween. I want people to know I'm 
gay, but I don't want them to think I'm gay. 
It's all my faul~ I'm sure. You've done drag on­
stage in The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Any­
more [the Tennessee Williams play in which he 
assayed a female role] , and of course you 
have a very funny drag scene in Stage Beauty. 
Well, I wouldn't dress up for Hal­
loween. I wouldn't go to a club dressed 
in drag. For work, yeah, I like the idea. 
But having said that, from the age of 1 
to 10 I was a seasoned cross-dresser. I 
used to be taken out on these very 
macho things like hunting, and I would 
just be dreaming of being home and 
trying on my mother's nightdress. 
It makes it very hard to tell which British 
men are gay. And of course it doesn't make 
it any easier to tell when someone like 
Robbie Williams is witty and clever and 
records a love duet with you. He just 
doesn't care what people might think. 
He doesn't care. ~

Tbat had to be fun [recording the duet 
"Tbey Can't Take That Away From Me" for 
Williams's 2001 big band album Swing When 
You're Winning] . 
It was really fun and very memorable, 
because I recorded that on September 
12 here in New York. 
Really? 
When I think of September the 11th, I 
was watching the television between 
takes and singing this extraordinary 
song. It was such a weird juxtaposition. 
We did it for two days, and the second 
day all those rains came. It was a very 
extraordinary time. Funny enough, I 
felt ... were you here? 
Yes. 
I thought afterwards, when you were in 
the city, you knew if you asked anyone 
for anything, they would help you. 
They'd do it. You could feel the spirits of 
the dead hovering around. It lasted until 
the rain came. That rain came, and then 
the whole thing of what they were doing 
down there in the rain ... you could feel 
that energy went down and it turned 
into this panic and then victimization 
and then anger. But for the first few 
days I thought, My God, this could her­
ald the biggest change in the world. If 
everyone could see how all New York­
ers-the most hardened bitches on the 
planet-how they are now in the eye of 
this disaster. And that changed. 
You've reunited with Marek Kanievska, the 
director of your breakthrough film, Another 
CountJy. Another director you worked with who hasn't worked for many years, for 18 or 20 
years, is Russian director Sergei Bondarchuk. 
He's dead, so he's not going to work 
again. 
You did make ... And Quiet Flows the Don 
with him, right? [It's based on the novel by 
Nobel Prize-winning author Mikhail 
Sholokhov.] 
That was his last thing. I killed him. 
I've killed quite a few. and the pixie queen was looking after 
things and making dinner. I come in 
the door with Sergei, and hanging from 
the chandelier is a Barbie doll. And I go 
into the bathroom, and sitting by the 
toilet paper is another one. Then I go 
into the sitting room, and lying on the 
couch-everywhere-are Barbie dolls, 
and they're positioned and combing 
each other's hair. I'm picking them up 
and hiding them behind things as 
Sergei comes in, and I run into the 
kitchen and say, "What the We haven't seen it yet. 
The fIlm is lost. TIIEADVOCATE hell are you doing with 
these Barbie dolls?" And he 
says, "Oh, relax! Just tell 
him they're mine." What happened? 
It was financed by ... a 
builder in Naples. They did­
n't really care about it. The 
print was locked in a safe 
in Naples for a few years. 
Now apparently it's got 
back to Russia and [Bon­
darchuk's] daughter-who 
I saw when I was in 
Moscow the other day-is 
trying to get it together. POLL

www.advocate.com How did he die? Heart attack? 
Everyone died in our movie. 
We had four deaths, four 
weddings, and three babies. 
The first person who died 
was one of the Italian grips 
who had a heart attack out-
side the hotel. The second 
person who died was the 
guy organizing the wind ma­
chine, which was a pro­
peller from an old Russian How did you kill him? The 
stress of the whole thing? 
The stress of the whole 
thing. Also, he didn't realize I was gay 
at first. And the character I play is one 
of the most popular characters in Rus­
sia. He realized I was gay when I 
brought this tiny little pixie queen to 
do my cooking, and this pixie collected 
Barbie dolls. The first time I asked 
Sergei Bondarchuk to dinner was 
when I had just moved into a new flat, plane. He was decapitated 
by it. His head flew over the entire set 
and landed a little way from where we 
were standing. 
THE ADVOCATE 152 I NOVEMBER 9, 2004 [ Trying not to laugh and failing] Oh ... 
And then the cherry picker-
Did you stop for the day? 
[Pauses to think] No, we didn't.</p>
<p>You had to keep moving. 
The guy driving the cherry picker ran 
over a couple with their child and 
killed them. I know it's funny, but life 
is very cheap there. 
Sergei's death obviously brings up The Next 
Best Thing. There were stories in the lon­
don tabloids saying Madonna caused direc­
tor John Schlesinger's stroke, and one even 
said she killed him. [It's all based on letters 
Schlesinger donated to the British Film 
Institute, some of which detailed his 
complaints about the film and her behavior.] 
[Shocked] No. 
You didn't know this? They've pulled out 
details from the upcoming biography by 
William Mann [Edge of Midnight: The Life of 
John Schlesinger] . 
No! No, I think The Next Best Thing did 
help to kill John Schlesinger. In that 
sense, if anyone has the guilt, it's me. 
Because, urn ... John really shouldn't 
have been working. I wanted to make a 
film that had the same kind of tonal 
quality as Shampoo and was more a 
slice of life and not about a miniseries, 
which our fIlm ended up being. Its tone 
was just too general, and he was too old 
to understand about specific tone, I 
think. But Madonna didn't kill him. 
Some of your projects people always won­
der about. The secret agent who is bisexual. 
[A project called P.S.I Love You.] It 
seemed like you'd be able to make it 
happen. Was The Next Best Thingwhat you 
rolled the dice on in Hollywood? 
No, I think that was probably my fault 
too. I don't think I've ever been well 
organized enough. Hollywood re­
sponds very well to things if you're 
right in there and right on the case. I 
can't blame .. .if I'd been on the case 
better, if my writing partner had been 
on the case better, we'd have got stuff 
done. But we weren't. And then The 
Next Best Thing happened. 
Same thing with Martha and Arthul! [His 
proposed pairing with Julia Roberts about a 
famous Hollywood couple, one gay and one 
straight, who are filming a costume epic about 
Marie Antoinette as their public lives unravel.] 
Martha and Arthur, Julia did not like 
how the script came out. And she's 
probably right. The first half of the 
script was good, and the second half 
didn't quite work. I'm sure you're always writing. Do you keep 
a diary or journal? 
Uh-huh. 
That'll make a good book someday. 
I want to write my biography, actually. 
You didn't want to get too specific in an 
interview, which I understand. But if you 
wanted to do it right for a memoir, I 
assume, you'd have to talk about who was 
homophobic and who was supportive during 
your experiences in Hollywood. 
I think it's a bore when you're a very 
lucky performer, in one sense, to com­
plain too much about where in your 
terms things have not measured up to 
what you think you deserve. In one 
sense, I feel very much like my career 
has been totally fucking blessed. Be­
cause I have fairly seamlessly-fairly 
seamlessly, not altogether, not all the 
time-kept going and lived and really 
lived and been to all sorts of different 
places. That is all good. That is really 
the best thing. The rest is fine print. 
One good thing about The Next Best Thing 
was that your dog, who has since passed 
away, had a starring role. I know you can't 
replace him, but have you found someone 
else, another dog? 
No, I want a human being next. 
Seems reasonable. 
But I can't hold one down. 
For long. 
No, not that, but I would like to have a 
human being. 
So you're not in a relationship? That's 
depressing. I don't mind if you don't have a 
really big Hollywood career because you came 
out. But you should at least have a boyfriend. 
I never stay long enough in one place to 
have one. It's very difficult to have a 
boyfriend when you don't live anywhere. 
Something happened. I stopped living 
anywhere, and now I can't start living 
somewhere. I don't know. Once it hap­
pened and once you get into that rhythm 
of moving all the time, then you're mov­
ing all the time, and it's difficult to break 
it. And I want to break it, because I'd 
definitely like to be in a relationship .•
