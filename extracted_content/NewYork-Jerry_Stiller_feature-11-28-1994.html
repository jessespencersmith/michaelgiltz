            <p>OnS 
~ster of His Domain W hafs wrong with this picture? Nothing, as far as Jeny Stiller's concerned. He's starring in 
the Broadway comedy of the same name; radio spots written, produced, and perfonned by 
him and his wife, Anne Meara, continue to appear with pleasing regularity; the kids are in 
the business (God help them) and doing well (his son directed Reality Bites; his daughter does stand· 
up); and he may even squeeze in another appearance or two this year on Seinfeld if they call. How­
ever, it would be nice if his character in the play were a little younger. For an earlier version of the 
Donald Margulies comedy, "I read for the part of the son, Alan Rosenberg's character," says Stiller. 
"I had no idea that I would be right for the 
grandfather one day." Substantially revised, 
What's Wrong With This PicfJJre? is ''the 
story of a family sitting shiva, and this hap­
pens to be my daughter· in-law [Faith 
Prince). We find out everyone's feelings 
about her. In my case, I'm a 75-year~ld 
ex-taxi driver whose license has been 
revoked, and I was in love with this woman 
for twenty years while she was married to my 
son." That's amazing, but not as amazing as 
what being on a hit show can do for an actor. 
"I'm really kind of in shock," says Stiller, 
who plays the father of George on Seinfeld. "People on the street give me all kinds of comments on 
why I'm too rough on George, why I'm not rougher on George. A man said to me, 'What are you doing 
to our generation? You're making us parents look like fools.' People stop their cars in traffic to talk 
to me. Suddenly your stock goes up and you're back on Broadway again." MICHAEL GILT2</p>
