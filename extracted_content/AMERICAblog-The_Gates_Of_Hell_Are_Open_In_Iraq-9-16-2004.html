9/16/2004 10:01:00 PMThat sadly accurate quote - from Amr Moussa, head of the ArabLeague -- comes from an excellent front-page story in USA Todayabout the swiftly deteriorating situation in Iraq. As John pointed outearlier, even BAGHDAD hasn't been made secure by US troops.Here's the telling detail that hit home with me:"Haifa Street, a major artery in downtown Baghdad that iscrowded with shops, homes and government offices, is nowknown locally as "Death Street" because of the constantattacks there, says Munther Mohammed, 26. 'Everymorning when I go out, I say goodbye to my wife anddaughters because we know we may not be coming home,'he says."
