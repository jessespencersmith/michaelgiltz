A CHANGE IS GONNA COME (Clockwise from top) In 2004, Takahiro hon­
ors the venue's good-luck charm, the Tree of Hope, at the Amateur Night 
Super Top Dog Finals; the revamped seats; the Tree of Hope, a stump dat­
ing to around 1934 and which was once located at 131st St. and Seventh 
Ave., known then as "The Boulevard of Dreams" because of its theaters; 
the new marquee; Capone, who will host Amateur Night this Wednesday.</p>

hough the Empire State Building and the Statue of 
Liberty come in just ahead of it, the .A:pollo Theater is 
still one of New York City's most popular tourist sites 
and a national landmark -so it's time Harlem's grand 
shrine of rhythm and blues got an extreme makeover. 
The perfonnance space reopens Wednes· 
day after a summer hiatus with the return of 
a 72-year-old tradition, Amateur Night 
aUhe Apollo (now hosted by Capone), 
a welcome by New York Congressman 
Charles Rangel and a perfonnance by hip­
hop. yiolinists -and previous Amateur 
Night winners -Nuttin But Stringz. 
The theater, built in 1914, was in need of 
more than just a quick touchup, says tour 
<14.' Ii,stor and longtime Apollo mainstay 
Biil!YiMitchell. 
''When people walk past, they see the 
new marquee," says Mitchell, who began 
working at the Apollo when he was a kid 
running errands for starS like Redd Foxx, 
Ray Charles and Moms Mabrey. 
"Inside, the audience will see plasma 
screens on the walls, a brand-new stage, 
new seating and new stairs. We've taken 
a beating from fans for the way the place 
looked in the past. Now, when one comes 
to the Apollo Theater, they say, 'My God, 
look at this place.' " 
[t's the latest step in a multiyear, top­
to-bottom revamping of the Apollo, 
where "Amateur Night" has reigned every 
Wednesday since 1934. Certainly 
e¥€lyone has noliced rhe new 
marquee. But preBident an.d 
CEO Janelle Procope sayS the 
c f.Mes are the most signifi-
fSince the Apollo's doors 
,~ e reopened in 1981 by 
fl' 'I Sutton, the business­
and one-time Manhattan 
ugh presiden t. 
,) . 'We replaced all the seats, [but] they're 
still a replica of the original ones," says 
Procope . 'We've completely redone the 
stage, as well as our greenroom, which 
will make it better for cocktail parties and 
other pre-concert events." 
Upcoming shows include Dionne War­
wick's return to the Apollo on Sept. 21 af­
ter many years, the solo debut of "Ameri­
can Idol" winner Fantasia Barrino on Sept. 
22 and Queen Latifah on Nov. 11. And 
a new batch of shows for the syndicat-
ed series "Showtime at the Apollo" (which 
launched in 1987) will tape at the end of 
September. 
Sometime in the next two years, the 
theater will briefly shut down again for 
more interior restoration . But even during 
that work, the Apollo will forge ahead with 
plans to raise money for an endowment 
(it's a nonprofit organization), continue 
the recently launched internship program 
for high school students, and prepare for 
its annual fund-raisers as well as a 75th­
anniversary celebration that will last from 
July 2009 through the end of 2010.

~ " Q Despite all the ambi-
tious plans, it's impossible to 
forget the history of the place. 
"When they cut up the stage, I was in 
tears," admits the 56-year-old Mitchell, 
who tells stories about everything from 
his grandparents seeing the debut of Ella 
Fitzgerald to the night comedian Bill 
Maher asked for the air conditioning to 
be turned off and the crowd sweated and 
drank and laughed like crazy. 
"I was crying when they tore up that 
floor - I know all the greats that have per­
fonned on that stage," Mitchell says. "I had 
the construction guys give me a piece of it. 
I'm going to have it framed. 
"The rest of it was thrown away. People 
have come in and said, 'You could have put 
that on eBay.' " • 
REFLECTIONS Among the 
thousands of performers 
to shake, rattle and roll 
on the Apollo's storied 
stage are James Brown 
(above), Diana Ross and 
the Supremes (left) and 
then-Little Stevie Wonder 
(below). The Apollo back 
in the day (1.1, advertising 
a show by Otis Redding 
and the Marvellettes, 
among others, on its old
