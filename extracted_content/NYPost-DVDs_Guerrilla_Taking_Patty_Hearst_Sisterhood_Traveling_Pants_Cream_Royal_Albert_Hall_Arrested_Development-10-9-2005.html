Z Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst 
**** DocuRama, $26.95 
~~---------------------------
ONE of the best films of the year, this engrossing documentary 
.o:eaptures the bizarre tale of a well-to-do heiress being kidnapped by 
a pseudo-revolutionary group called the SLA, only to denounce her 
family and join the group in thievery. The sheer craziness of the 
times including a food giveaway demanded by the thugs that turns 
into a mini-riot is deftly captured in a trim 89 minutes. Extras 
include commentary by director Robert Stone. 
The Sisterhood of the 
Traveling Pants 
* Warner Bros •• $28.98 
A sappy teen flick that wastes 
four talented actresses (includ­
ing Alexis Bledel and Amber 
Tamblyn), this melodrama 
about the summer four best 
friends spend apart is based on 
a best-selling series of novels. 
:.=-Makes "Beaches" seem tough­
minded. Extras include video 
commentary from the young 
women and a talk with author 
_ Ann Brashares. 
Cream: Royal Albert 
Hall London May 2-3-
5-62005 
*** Rhino, $29.98 
IF you can't get tickets to see 
Cream at Madison Square Gar­
den later this month (and who 
_ can?), snap up this live concert 
-<DVD of their May gigs in Lon­
don. The band got better the 
more they played, so it's no 
surprise most of these tracks 
are drawn from the May 6 
finale. These 19 songs and 
three alternate tracks (along 
with interviews) are an unex­
pected treat after all these 
years. Clapton is still God. Arrested 
Development, 
SeasonlWo ***1/, 
Fox, $39.98 --------------
ENJOY it while you can, 
because dead-in-the-water rat­
ings mean this third season will 
be the last for actor Jason Bate­
man's droll turn as the acerbic 
heart of the dysfunctional Bluth 
family. At least the creators did~ 
n't panic when cancellation 
loomed "Arrested Develop­
ment" is as bizarre as ever. 
Modest extras include com­
mentary tracks, deleted scenes 
and "Season One in 3 Minutes." 
Also out A superstitious 
fan's dilemma, "The New 
York Yankees Fall Classic 
Collector's Edition 1996-2001" 
(A&E; $79.95); and the Nancy 
Drew for the new millennium 
series "Veronica Mars First 
Season" (Warner Bros.; $59.98)</p>
