Robert Rodriguez's "Once Upon a Time in Mexico." 
"ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO" 
Robert Rodriguez brings his "EI Mariachi" trilogy 
to a smashing conclusion with Antonio Banderas 
and Salma Hayek reunited as lovers, joined by a ter­
rifically diverse cast including Mickey Rourke, 
Willem Dafoe, Ruben Blades, Cbeech Marin and 
Enrique Iglesias, but above all Johnny Depp as a 
one-armed special agent ($28.95; Columbia TriStar). 
"PUNK'D": COMPLETE FIRST SEASON 
"THE SIMPLE LIFE" 
Just as stand-up comics were polishing lines like 
"Dude, where's my career?" Ashton Kutcher pulled 
the plug on "Punk'd" ($26.99; Paramount). Because it 
plays pranks on celebs like Justin Timberlake , 
Kelly Osbourne and Pink, it's actually more repeat­
able than most hidden-camera shows. And surely al­
Qaeda is buying up copies of "The Simple Life" 
($19.98; Fox) and sending it to all their friends: what 
better way to inspire anti-Americanism than Paris 
Hilton and Nicole Richie being self-centered down 
on the farm? 
"SPELLBOUND" 
"Spellbound" ($26.95; Columbia TriStar) is a docu­
mentary that follows a group of kids as they proceed 
through regional competition toward the national 
final spelling bee in Washington . Delightful, tense, 
amusing, it's more entertaining than any mainstream 
HollYVI·ood movie you saw this year. 
"THE SIDNEY POrnER COLLECTION" 
''THE BEST OF SOUL CINEMA" 
Sidney Poitier seems like such a stuffed shirt. but 
give the man his due with this five-DVD set: which 
includes 1967's "In the Heat of the Night," as well as 
two sequels with the detective Mr. Tibbs; "Lilies of 
the Field" from 1963, along with "For Love of Ivy." For 
hipper fun, you can enjoy the kitsch and kicks of Pam 
Grier in "Coffy" and "Foxy Brown," the overlooked 
"Cooley High" and other entries in the flve-DVD set 
"Soul Cinema" ($62.96 each; MGM). 
"THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST" 
In seven years Lawrence Kasdan directed four 
gems: "Body Heat," "The Big Chill," "Silverado" and 
this 1988 Oscar nominee ($19.97; Warner Bros.), with 
William Hurt as a recluse roused by Geena Davis. 
Also out: 
Jean Renoir's classic "The Rules of the Game" 
($39.95; Criterion); Kevin Costner's pokey western 
"Open Range" ($29.99; Touchstone); Gene Autry's 
trim "Back in the Saddle" and "Under Fiesta 
Stars" ($19.99 each; Image), two Western s from 1941; 
"Barney Miller": The First Season ($29.95; Colum­
bia TriStar); and Scarlett Johannson's indie comic 
gem "Manny I\( Lo" ($24.96; Sony Pictures Classics). 
COming out next Tuesday: 
The sixth season of "Friends"; the teen drama 
"Thirteen"; and "The Sherlock Holmes Collec­
tion: Box 3," with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.</p>
