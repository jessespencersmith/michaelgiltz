6/07/2005 10:42:00 AMThe NYT's Kristof urged Bush to act in Darfur. Now theWashington Post also weighs in on Bush and Africa, calling forhim to dig deeper to fight the intractable poverty and debt thathas held back that continent. (As it points out, even a $6 billioneffort would still keep the US far behind its allies in giving as apercentage of GDP.But the Washington Post makes a curious statement in its leadeditorial:The Bush administration already has done a lot fordeveloping countries. Its global AIDS initiative hastransformed the money available to fight the pandemic....Unless they know something we don't know, this is completelyuntrue. Are they just stupidly remembering that Bush mad a dramaticpledge of $15 billion and forgetting how Bush perverted that goal forpolitical purposes and hasn't even come close to matching his wordswith deeds?Yes, Bush has transformed the money available to fight the pandemic-- by making it less available. He's defunded programs already inplace that work and can save lives. He's politicized other funding byrefusing to make any money available to any group that wants totake step one in fighting AIDS -- making condoms available. Even ifthe money the US gives goes solely to fighting AIDS, he refuses tohave anything to do with any group that might somewhere atsometime be involved in abortion. And Bush callously insists ourmoney -- if and when it is ever available -- buy only namebranddrugs, even though they're three times more expensive thangenerics. (In other words, the same amount of money could savethree times as many lives, but Bush would rather cater tomultinational drug companies thatn focus on saving lives.)How could the Washington Post be so ill-informed? Bush broke hispromise to increase the fight against AIDS in Africa and his actionshave actually SLOWED DOWN that fight. The last the MSM botheredto report on it, Bush hadn't even come close to meeting even thesimple dollar figures he'd thrown out. Hopefully, some group will callthe Post on its misleading representation of Bush's indefensible actionin this pandemic.
