Ok, I've preached for a long time that as long as
the two best make the finals, there's no real bigscandal about who goes home in what order. Butif Jason Castro doesn't say "bye bye" this week,it'll be a shonda.
The theme is the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame,
which leaves the door wide open for anything and
everything.
DAVID COOK  -- So he sings "Hungry Like The
Wolf" by Duran Duran? I'm fond of Duran Duran and they have some great pop songs, but the key
word there is POP. Yes, Cook pulled a fast one on Lionel Richie, but in general he's plowed theemo-rock vein to good effect. He might have toughened up "Save A Prayer" or rocked out on "LastChance On The Stairway" or...in fact, the pop tunes of Duran Duran are just not a good fit for him,especially when he doesn't change the song up or give it a make-over. You're just not gonna lookcool singing "Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-dooooooo!" (Their breakthrough UShit was at #3 for three weeks, which isn't easy to do, actually.) In fact, Cook's performance seemedto be a rewind to his poser moments early on in the Top 12 when he seemed overly pleased withhimself and generally proud as a peacock. From his taped interviews to his attitude during thecritiques, Cook seemed to be playing it super cool, as if he were suddenly above it all rather thanhungry like a wolf to win it all. Either he's bowed to the inevitable and realized he can't win whensomeone with the initials "D" and "A" is destined for victory (in which case he should relax andhave fun -- no pressure, dude) -- or he's decided it's not cool to look like he cares about winning.Randy was mixed; Paula said, "Your 'Hungry Like The Wolf' has left me with a big appetite." Sheseemed determined to be coherent and cogent tonight, always with a lengthy comment at the readythat made sense and never rambled. Simon thought it was good enough...barely.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-top-4-j_b_100531.html [4/5/2009 7:00:34 PM]that Syesha was great tonight. I think what he meant to say was that she was great-looking,
because she looked awesome in a slinky, sparkly gold dress and high heels, doing her best TinaTurner imitation. And it was an imitation, albeit a good, sexy one. And it's not Tuna Turner's"Proud Mary," Syesha, it's Creedence Clearwater Revival's, though Tina darn near stole it awayfrom John Fogerty. CCR hit #2 for three weeks and Ike & Tina Turner took it to #4 two years laterin 1971. By the way, if you haven't seen Tina sing this tune on the Rolling Stones documentary,Gimme Shelter, you're in for a scorching treat -- it's about the sexiest, rockingest thing you've everseen. Syesha had fun with it, right down to the same twirl across the stage, even if she was a bitsharp on some of the "rolling"'s. But she sure learned how to shake her hips. Randy and Paulaloved it while Simon was -- yet again -- harshly negative, calling it a bad shrieking version. Thetruth was somewhere in between, but much closer to Randy and Paula.
JASON CASTRO  -- Sang Bob Marley's "I Shot The Sheriff." Jason said in the video intro that
because it was rock and roll hall of fame week, there were a few songs he knew. (A few?) Marley
was a natural but like Cook, Jason made a disastrously wrong pick. First, he has to compete with
two legendary versions -- both the Marley original and the Eric Clapton cover that remains his only
#1 hit. (It was also Marley's only tangential Top 40 hit since he only had one single -- "Roots, Rock,
Reggae" -- chart at all, peaking at a measly #51. On the bright side, Marley's compilation Legend
has sold 10 million copies in the US alone and is one of the best-selling greatest hits sets ever.)
Besides all that history, "Sheriff" is a dangerous song and danger is not Jason Castro's middlename. "One Love," "No Woman No Cry," "Is This Love," "Buffalo Soldier," "Is This Love" -- almostany classic Bob Marley tune (even "Redemption Song") would have been a better fit for Castro. Hejumped around on stage like it was a party tune, his voice was thin and lost in the mix -- it was justawful. Randy was negative, Paula couldn't find much of anything to say and Simon said it was"utterly atrocious."
DAVID ARCHULETA  -- Sang "Stand By Me." Archuleta is so young that this Ben E. King song
was a classic #4 hit in 1961 and then charted again 25 years later when it was featured in the Rob
Reiner film Stand By Me  in 1986  (still the best movie adaptation for Stephen King) and went to #9
and yet it would still  be another four years before Archuleta would even be born. And yet that's still
no reason for Ryan to refer to him as "Li'l Dave." It's a solid performance, though Archuleta isdefinitely helped when the camera comes in on a mid-shot and cuts off his diva hand movements.
His breathing is less noticeable but now that Andrew Lloyd Webber has pointed it out I can't stop
watching to see how many times Archuleta struggles with closing his eyes. His applause is literally
ten times as loud and strong as the others. (Bizarrely, Paula applauds him specifically for listeningto ALW and not closing his eyes all the time when he clearly still does it.) All three judges rave,though Ryan insists Archuleta is so tense during the critique he seems to run out of breathing(maybe that's why Archuleta seems smart by keeping his mouth shut). "Their faces scare me!" helaughs, melting the few hearts left that aren't already in a puddle at his feet.
DAVID COOK  -- Sang The Who's "Baba O'Riley" (aka "Teenage Wasteland"), a rock radio staple
from 1971. He really needed to raise his game after the first forgettable performance and he does.
Cook starts off nice and slow, which pays off so well I almost wish he'd stayed in that vein Instead,and with predictably crowd-pleasing results, he starts to rock out and satisfyingly so. Still, it's avery long, meandering song and hard to truncate -- he fakes it well, though ending with the words"Teenage waste--" probably wasn't intentional. Still, much much better. Randy is positive, Paulasays, "I'm really humbled to sit here and watch your soul," while Simon smiles at her babbling in afriendly indulging manner and then says simply, "Welcome back, David Cook."
SYESHA MERCADO -- Sang Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come." It's easy to make fun of
Idol  contestant's sometime lack of knowledge, but hey, they have a lot more rock n roll history to
absorb than old fogeys like me who only had the Sixties and Fifties to catch up on. So it's fine thatSyesha didn't know Cooke's greatest triumph was written in the heat of the Civil Rights era (and asan inspired creative response to Bob Dylan's "Blowin' In The Wind"). But I couldn't help laughingwhen she linked the Civil Rights era to her appearance on Idol  -- that was a pivotal moment in
history and this is a pivotal moment in her personal life. OK, I get it. But still. Anyway, it's a bit of ashock to realize the tune -- released after Cooke died all too soon -- only hit #31 in 1965. Syeshacomes out in a prom dress (with some nice cleavage that offsets the dowdy look nicely) and givesthe tune her all. It's more stately than soulful thanks to a stolid arrangement but she does well andis given a loving closeup during the big Idol  style finale that compensates for a slight wavering on
that final note. In all, a big night for her. Randy, however, disses her (have all three judges everpraised her at the same time?), while Paula gives her a standing ovation and talks about how

$40,000Syesha has become a star and links the song to Syesha's personal growth and soon Syesha is
melting down in tears. Simon does one of his patented dramatic pauses before revealing he agreeswith Paula one hundred percent and teasingly chides Randy, "You made her cry!"
JASON CASTRO  -- Sang Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man." Castro showed great taste this
week, hitting Marley and Dylan at once. "Mr Tambourine Man" was the last semi-bitter time Dylan
would see another artist, in this case the Byrds, as the latest of a string of acts who seemed to have
smash hit after hit with his tunes while he couldn't make a dent in the Top 10. That would end two
months later in July of '65 when Dylan finally had his own smash hit with the #2 classic "Like A
Rolling Stone." Unlike "Sheriff," this tune fits Castro like a glove, especially with him sitting on a
stool and strumming away on his guitar. Perfect. Then he forgets the chorus and miserably hums
along instead of singing, "Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me/In the jingle jangle
morning, I'll come following you." Who could forget "jingle jangle morning," one of the iconic rock
phrases of all time? See, pot use really can cause memory lapses. Ironically, the far more difficult
verses aren't a problem for Castro who remembers the chorus the second time around and then
ends very awkwardly with a quick halt in the rhythm and an ill-placed gentle coda. The
performance wasn't revelatory but this was far, far better than his first one. But of course forgetting
the words at this stage is an unforgivable sin. None of the judges can find anything nice to say and
Simon typically doesn't try. "I'd pack your suitcase," he says.
DAVID ARCHULETA  -- Sang Elvis Presley's "Love Me Tender." It is indeed refreshing to see
him stay away from soaring inspirational ballads and Archuleta just sits on a stool, stares lovingly
and sincerely into the camera and has his way with the tune. Hilariously, he only gets four wordsinto the song before involuntarily closing his eyes ("Love me tender, Love --" and boom, they shut.)After a while he is looking below  the camera (presumably into the mosh pit) instead of into it and
then his voice breaks slightly at the finale but he uses it like the uncanny little pro he is and endsnicely. I listen to it again without watching the picture, thus avoiding his puppy dog eyes, and it'sbetter than I thought at first, despite the constant runs and inability to just sing a melody for morethan a phrase or two. Randy raves, Paula says "I felt your heart" and Simon says "You didn't justbeat the competition. You crushed them." Indeed.
BOTTOM TWO  -- Well, I would assume the bottom two would be Syesha and Jason but given
Cook's relatively weak showing, Syesha's strength and her tears, maybe it'll be Cook and Castro.
Nonetheless, anyone other than Castro going home will be an honest to goodness shocker.

They are all just a bunch of kids tryin' to get a break.
I do find it strange that all these old white men who write blogs about American Idol have torn Syeshaapart for DARING to compare her struggle with the people Sam Cooke was writing about. Yep... if I wasa young black woman the main people who could tell me how to feel about my experience is old, tireda$$ white men. I am a 57 year old white woman, what do I know about what it means to grow up blackin America???? I give the kid credit for actually even giving a care about those who struggled to makethings better for her. Maybe, just maybe she was shedding a tear for them.In any even she can sing. And, she is kick-you-in-the-BUTT gorgeous!Jason is so bad that Elvis keeps trying to posses my soul so that he can shoot a rifle at the TV when
Jason sings.
Both of the Davids are great. I would prefer that Cook wins, but Archuleta is okay, too.

I agree. At least give the girl some credit for bringing up political/social issues on AI. Andwhat is wrong with relating one's personal struggle to a political struggle? If she were born xgenerations ago, she'd be a slave.

i think what was objectionable about syesha's comparison is that it seemed shallow. to take asong about one of the most important times in black history, the civil rights struggle, and thencompare it to her experience on a reality show does not do that song justice. i really like her, but watching her bawl over that, instead of being moved by the true meaningof the song, was a little silly. 
castro has to go. he looks like he doesn't even care anymore. i used to be a big fan of his
too...
and archuleta...i feel like i'm the only one that hasn't melted. can he please sing a melody for
once?! he did one verse of stand by me and the rest was rambling runs. it's all so calculatedand insincere. i'm not buying it.

As I mentioned after Levine's post (although it disappeared for some reason), it wasclear that she knew the significance of the tune in the context of the early '60s"shejust failed to articulate why the song meant so much to her, but it was there in herface, and her voice.
And yes, little David's charm is wearing thin. He will win this thing, however.

Oh, BTW, while the theme was the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, they weren't given free reign over any
song from any of the inductees (Duran Duran certainly ain't in there), but were limited to the licensablesongs from the hall's "500 songs that shaped rock & roll."
Personally, I kinda wondered if someone would tackle Donna Summer's "Love To Love You Baby."
Sounds like it was just written for David Arch, no?
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
True, but I think 500 songs to choose from is one of the most extensive lists they ever get -- Ido wish the show would post the songs the kids are choosing from in advance. That would letus all judge their selections better. Archuleta fake maning through Donna Summer for eight
minutes? My head is spinning.
Charity See Profile  I'm a Fan of Charity  permalink
i think syesha did just fine - again - and - again - wasn't completely complimented for it. what we tend to
forget is this is a competition of primarily amateurs, not hardened, seasoned professionals. sure, some
have professional experience, and some have competitive singing experience, but essentially, these
are young people trying to find their chops in a tense-filled months-long competition. if they at any pointinsert any originality into their performances, it is the rare occurence. the pressure simply to performably must be huge.
i think they receive so much push and "advice" from behind the scenes that they do much of NOTHING
on their own - from show producers, hairdressers, stylists, creative consultants, voice coaches, songcoaches, p.r. consultants, scriptwriters, moms/dads, relatives. you, meaning viewers, don't think theydo that by themselves do you?
i for one, can tell the difference between tina turner and syesha, and if she wants to copy tina's version
that's fine with me. it was one of the best performances of the evening. and the crying? i felt she cried
because up til then all of the celebrity judges had been unduly critical of her and finally, at least paula
was standing up and giving her proper due.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I agree about her crying. It was absolutely obvious that after weeks of negative criticisms for
solid performances that when Paula echoed her pr-taped thoughts on what the song meant to
her, that it got to her -- especially after Randy gave her another negative review she probably
wasn't expecting. I think for the last three weeks when she felt like she delivered that it's been
hard for Syesha to hear Randy and or Simon slam her. Hearing affirmation, even from the
always affirming Paula, just got to her.

I like David A, but only because he has the BEST voice and always makes the songs sound good,
regardless of what they are. He sings on key, has good rhythm and phrasing, and makes good choiceswhen changing it up. 
I do think he needs much much more coaching on stage presence, and, of course, he just needs some
time to grow up. He's only 17, and a young 17, at that. The eye closing thing is a tough one, and MOSTof the performers on AI do it. Jason does it, Brooke did it, Ramielle did it, Kristie did it.
David C is my next choice, then Syesha. 
IMO, Jason should have been gone AT LEAST 2 weeks ago. I really just don't like him at all.
DCDan See Profile  I'm a Fan of DCDan  permalink
Re David A.'s readiness to be crowned AI champion, he will win for the same reason Jordin
Sparks -- another high-schooler -- won last season. He has the *potential* to be the bestsinger among this batch of contestants. He's not ready now and Jordin wasn't truly readywhen she won. IMO, they should raise the minimum age requirement by at least a year ortwo. It would add credibility to the show and raise the level of competition. 16- and 17-year-olds are not mature enough vocally, and are generally not poised enough to handle the

one thing i've noticed about david archuleta is he is just flat out physically tired. he
has lost some of that wonderful sparkle and peppy enthusiasm he had during the
first couple of weeks. 
the boy has a genuine love for song and music and has a voice that will take him to
a good career in show business. part of his appeal, at 17, is his boyish, childishcharisma. i think he's either plum tired or told to be more "adult" in his presentations
- but whatever it is, that bounce, that love, that pep and sparkle have gone from the
boy we first saw in weeks one and two. it will be awhile before we see what david
truly can do - but make no mistake, this kid is a keeper.

What was with the sound last night? The voice mics were so loud that you heard every breath and
mouth movement while the accompaniment was really pushed into the background. It magnified everyminor issue the singers had as well as any pitch problems. It was really difficult to watch this episode. Itwas that bad.
David A was spot on with every note and really had the only tolerable performance because of the
sound issues. Cook's first song was really bad with this sound problem, and Jason Castro soundedexactly as Simon said.... like a first round audition loser. Syesha did well in spite of it, but it wasn't the
night for choreography.
Did anyone else notice this? I DVR'd the performance (watching the primary results) so maybe it was
my DVR... I don't know.

I noticed the vocals were a little bright in the mix, but I'm away from my DVR and can't checkit out again ot see what you're talking about. You can blame the producers, especially if ithappened the whole show, though of course it also depends on how the singers use themicrophone.

Comments are closed for this entryI got a slight feeling that David Cook was trying to throw this thing.
I really don't think he wants to win - can't say I blame him.
Michael, did you sense that at all or did I imagine it?

I don't think he's trying to lose or has decided he doesn't want to win. I think he's eitther
realized he CAN'T win (because Archuleta is clearly a prohibitive favorite) or he thinks it's not
cool to look like he wants to win. In either case, it came off as indifference last night.

Am I the only person in the room who cannot stand David Arugula? The guy looks like a fetal alcohol
baby and has no soul whatsoever. Can't really stand any of the remaining idols. Screw 'em, I'm going
home.

I am a 40 something black guy but I still like him. I don't know what it is. I like his voice,
especially when he sings the ballands. He is young and it shows but think he will grow out ofit. I know he has his haters out there, but that is why there are so many successful artists.Different strokes for different folks.

No, you're not the only one. There's a strong "what's with the teeny bopper" contingent outthere. It's just that you're outnumbered by the screaming teenage girls. You probably didn't
care for Shaun Cassidy either.

I still have my heart-shaped Shaun Cassidy necklace! But David Archuleta makesme crave salty food.
I'm sad about Jason; I really do love his voice and his style of music. I wish he
would have made better song choices these last few weeks of the competition.
