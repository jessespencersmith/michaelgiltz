Before they dumped the original score for Interview 
With the Vampire, liefore writer Anne Rice lavishly 
praised the movie in a dramatic turnabout from 
her earlier combative stance, director Neil Jordan seemed 
genuinely at ease. While editing the movie, he was eager 
to discuss the challenges of Vampire. "When this book 
came up, I thought, This is perfect," says Jordan. "I want­
ed-I needed-to go 
in the direction of the 
grotesque." Though 
most of the controver­
sy had swirled around 
the casting of Tom 
Cruise, Jordan felt 
audiences would prob­
ably be more shocked 
by child actress 
Kirsten Dunst as Clau­
dia, a vampire who 
remains 9 years old in 
appearance but has 
the maturity and 
desires of a woman. 
Claudia also has to kill 
and kill again with B,.ad Pitt as Olle 0/ the damlled. 
pleasure. "I wanted somebody who had acted before," 
says Jordan, "because the demands of the part could be 
so disturbing. Kirsten understood the whole 
thing ... being trapped in a child's body; the se~suality; 
killing people like she's eating sweets, really, always 
wanting more. She enjoyed it. It's tremendous fun to play 
a vampire, especially if you're a little girl."
