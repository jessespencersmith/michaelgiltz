MERICAN audiences
know Billy Connolly
for a lot of reasons: his
appearance in the
raunchy documentary "The
Aristocrats," his dramatic
roles opposite Judi Dench
("Mrs. Brown") and Tom
Cruise ("The Last Samurai")
and his sitcoms (including
"Head of the Class"). We
know him for every reason
except the one that's made
hin an international star: his
standup act.
Connolly, whose recent
tours of Australia and New
Zealand sold out faster than
Springsteen in New Jersey, is
doing 20 shows at 37 Arts
from May 9 through June 3,
which offers plenty of oppor-
tunity to find out why he's
the best-selling comedian in
the world.
flrWhat's it like to switch
Y.from playing huge venues
in Australia to an intimate 485-
seat venue here in New York?
6 .It's a different beastie
l{oaltogether. The bigger
they get, the happier you
become until eventually it's
the small crowds that frighten
you. It's a bit like performing
for your aunts and uncles. It's
eot a nakedness. I'd much
iather walk out to a footbali
crowd. '
flol read your biography, and
Voit's like you read "Angela's
Ashes" and said, "Oh, I can give
him a run for his money." You
spoke about your mothel
abandoning you, your father
molesting you, being dirt-poor
and beaten by your aunt.
1.Oh, he had it easy.

harsh from the outside, but

it's oK.

V.relationship with your

A.I've spent my life up
l{othere onstase. I'd told
them all my secrets. There
was no embarrassment in it
for me. The sexual abusestuff was kind of difficult -
not to talk about but to go
through again.
ff oYou waited till they were
Y'dead.
ll .I think thar's the best
fliway. But to go back again
and teli it to the best ofyour
rememberings is weird and
umecessary. You shouldn't be
doiirg that too often. All I
wanted in my book was to be a
survivor. You cm get bevond
that s - - t whether it's poverty
or sexual abuse or divorce or
all ofthese. You survive.

11.And flourishl You can
f{cactually win! I live in a
fancy house and all that, all
those things people take as
success. I've got a castle here.
The kitchen is much bigger
than the apartment I grew up
in. I imagine people take that
as success, and in some ways I
suppose it is.
flrThere are a lot of stories
Vtabout how you became a
comic. My favorite is that when
you were a folk musician, you
forgot the words to a song and
tust started talking, and the
light went off in your head.

you can put on "Long Thll

impossible to listen to "Long

mood.
