            <p>The oldjoke is that every actor wants to 
direct. But Paula Patton, who stars in 
Outkast's musical drama "Idlewild," 
opening Friday, and this fall's "Deja Vu" 
with Denzel Washington, flipped it around. 
The Los Angeles-born Patton had been 
working as a young filmmaker, with her work 
featured on the Discovery Health Channel's 
documentary series "Medical Diaries." When 
that show ended, "I didn't know if what I really 
wanted to do was become a director," says 
Patton. "I remember sitting at my desk, trying 
to thi~k of something to write. Then I thought, since I was a little girl, I've loved to act." 
She followed through with acting lessons 
and a cameo in "Hitch." But now Patton has 
landed plum parts: as Andre Benjamin's love 
in "Idlewild" and the woman Washington 
travels back in time for in "Deja Vu." 
Her lack of experience was a plus when 
she auditioned for "Idlewild." "I just went in 
and had fun," she says. "I didn't feel pres­
sure because I didn't think I had a chance. 
So I had a blast." And the Prohibition-era-set 
movie from Benjamin and Antwan (Big Boi) 
Patton (no relation) lived up to the fun. "Everything in the movie revolves around 
a speakeasy, so there are great performance 
numbers, although there are times when 
Andre and Big Boi just sing to express a feel­
ing," she says. "It's part musical and part 
drama, part crime story and part love story. It 
mixes a lot of emotions together." 
So her decision to abandon life behind the 
camera to go in front of one has paid off. 
"When you choose your destiny in life, it's 
amazing how the world helps you get it," she 
says. "When I became unafraid, good things 
happened." Michael Giltz en</p>
