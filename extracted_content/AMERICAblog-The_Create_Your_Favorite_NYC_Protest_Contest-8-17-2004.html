8/17/2004 12:32:00 PMBloggers sparked this idea. Everyone come up with your favoriteprotest idea for the Republican National Convention.Emphyrio has a spooky, terrific idea: a display of mannequin limbs,one for every limb lost in Iraq.Phill and Bdawg suggest a reading of "The Pet Goat," with the AndyWarhol twist that readers deliver one word and then stare into spacefor seven minutes. To make it more media friendly, I'd suggest havinga team of protestors read it out loud en masse and then stare intospace with bewildered looks on their faces for seven minutes. Thatwould definitely make the local news.Came up with something better? Tell us here.
