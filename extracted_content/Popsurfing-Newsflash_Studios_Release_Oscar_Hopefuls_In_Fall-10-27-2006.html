            <p>F R I D AY,  O C TO B E R  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6Newsflash! Studios Release Oscar Hopefuls In FallIn a stunningly unoriginal piece, the LA Times asks us why it is somany adult, thoughtful films appear at the same time in the fall; thenthey give us the not-so startling answer that it's because movies hope topiggyback on the Oscars. They link it to the Weinsteins but in factreleasing serious movies towards the end of the year with summer farebeing typically lighter has been a trend for the past 30 years, at least.But is it true that serious movies only come out in the fall? The realtrend in the last ten years has been a major increase in year-roundprogramming, with some studios putitng out major films like "SavingPrivate Ryan" in the summer as counter-programming to fluff.Let's look at this year. Now, there's a difference between OscarHOPEFULS and Oscar nominees. But what "serious" movies werereleased this year? In March, they released Johnny Depp's TheLibertine, Sam Shepard's Don't Come Knocking, Robert Towne's AskThe Dust, Aaron Eckhart's Thank You For Smoking (which could stillget attention come awards time), Spike Lee's Inside Man (a popcornmovie, but still adult), and the terrific noir movie Brick. Now I'mincluding some indie films but ignoring most foreign films (like JoyeuxNoel which also came out in March). I'm just saying, here are someserious films that came out. In April, they released Friends WithMoney, The Notorious Bettie Page, Akeelah and the Bee and United 93.In May, they released Art School Confidential, Ed Norton's Down InThe Valley, and An Inconvenient Truth. In June, they released APrairie Home Companion, Wordplay, Who Killed The Electric Car andThe Devil Wears Prada. In July, the heart of summer, they releasedWoody Allen's Scoop, Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly and LittleMiss Sunshine. In August, they released World Trade Center, RobinWilliams' The Night Listener, Ryan Gosling (who is brilliant) in HalfNelson, and The Illusionist. In September, they releasedHollywoodland, Sherrybaby, The Black Dahlia, The Last Kiss, All TheKing's Men, The Last King of Scotland, The Queen and of courseJackass Number Two.Do more movies come out in the fall that are serious and substantial?Yes, of course. Is it the only time of the year serious movies withNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
