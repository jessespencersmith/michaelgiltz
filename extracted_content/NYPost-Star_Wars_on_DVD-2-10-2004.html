J'-..By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
~ pUT down that light saber and pick up a ~ credit card: The "Star Wars" trilogy is 
.......... finally coming to DVD Sept. 21. ~ Fans have long been clamoring for DVD rt) versions of the trilogy, the last holdouts 
. from the top 200 grossing films of all 
time to be scheduled for release on DVD. 
"Star Wars" creator George Lucas has fi­
nally relented, after insisting the three 
movies wouldn't be released until the final "Star Wars" hits theaters in May 2005. 
The set (details like pricing are still un­
available) will include four DVDs, with 
the fourth disc containing a brand-new 
two-hour documentary. 
The DVDs, which are certain to be 
blockbusters, are also certain to be con­
troversial: Despite pleas from "Star 
Wars" fanatics allover the world, these 
DVDs will not contain the original theat­
rical version of the movies. 
Instead, the DVDs will include the much-debated versions director Lucas re­
leased in the '90s with new digital effects 
and plot twists that softened the charac­
ter of Han Solo -even though DVD 
makes it easy to offer both the original 
and director's cut of a movie. 
It's simply a matter of an artist's right, 
says Jim Ward, a Lucasfilm vice president 
and the executive producer of the set. 
"We realize there's a lot of debate out 
there," says Ward. "But this is not a de­
mocracy. We love our fans, but this is about art and filmmaking. [George] has 
decided that the sole version he wants 
available is this one." 
The original "Star Wars" from 1977 is 
the second-highest-grossing movie of all 
time in the U.S. (behind "Titanic"), and 
all three "Star Wars" movies in the tril­
ogy still rank in the Top 20.
