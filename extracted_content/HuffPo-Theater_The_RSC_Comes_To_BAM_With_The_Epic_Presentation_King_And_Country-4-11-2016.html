Theater: The RSC Comes To BAM With The Epic
Presentation "King And Country"
04/11/2016 12:35 am ET  | Updated  Apr 11, 2017
KING AND COUNTRY: SHAKESPEARE'S GREAT CYCLE OF KINGS  *** out of ****
BAM
David Tennant (that's Doctor Who, to the groundlings) as Richard II! The great Antony Sher tackling Falstaff!
The young upstart Alex Hassell as Henry V! Yes, it's the Henriad or perhaps half a Henriad depending on yourpoint of view. The Royal Shakespeare Company tackles four of Shakespeare's History Plays with onesprawling company. I could happily dissect each individual play -- my complaints about Richard II,  my
pleasure in much of Henry IV Parts I  and II , my surprise at the ever-glorious punch of those famed rallying cries
in Henry V  and so on.
Yes, like any big messy affair such as this, the Henriad is a slow-moving target ripe for skewering. But it mustbe said that as an experience, seeing all four plays in the space of six days (one on Tuesday, the other threeon Saturday and Sunday) was unique and pleasurable. You had the fun of seeing actors pop up in variedroles, such as Jane Lapotaire starting things off in black at the start of Richard II,  mourning her husband
Thomas of Woodstock in a grand style that announced perhaps these four plays were really about her.  And
there she was again at the end some 12 hours of drama later, in greyish-white as Queen Isabel of France,wryly suggesting that perhaps a woman's presence would bring sense to the proceedings.
It was a rare feast to see this story told all at once. Reading the plays in a gulp simply doesn't have the same
power as immersing yourself in a darkened theater and watching actors bring it to life over a span of days.
Still, I had questions aplenty both large and small. Why suddenly do we get modern dress for the chorus in the
last two plays? (A Rolling Stones t-shirt?) And why does the chorus change his outfit several times seeminglyfor no reason in Henry V ? Why did Jasper Britton (a fine actor especially good as the feeble and sick with
dread Henry IV) fumble a tad not just during Richard II  but again in Henry IV  four days later? Why isn't Oliver
Ford Davies even more famous? Does Alex Hassell look more like Rufus Sewell or Jude Law, the bastard?And even if assassins dressed as ninjas, didn't someone realize they looked a little silly as a marauding gangin Richard II,  growling and mumbling like peasants in a Monty Python skit?) Yet I'd do it all again in a heartbeat
and only wish Henry VI I  and II  and III  and Richard III were on tap this week. (Fans of the BBC's Hollow Crown
take on the Henriad will be delighted to know they're doing the second clutch of plays this fall.)
Theater: The RSC Comes To BAM With The Epic Presentation "King And Country"</p>
<p>You're left with a host of impressions, marveling how seamlessly these plays work together and on their own.
The echoes of human frailty and ego, the lingering effects of evil deeds poisoning future deeds however good-intentioned, the relentless march of history both shaped by and somehow indifferent to the desires of peopleboth large and small -- it's all here. Rather hilariously, the History Plays are the works of Shakespeare that aresomehow less beloved than both the comedies and the tragedies. I suppose something had to come in third(or fourth, if you include the sonnets). After a lifetime of theater-going, I've never even seen Henry VI  even
once for lack of opportunity, while I've seen Hamlet a good X times (on stage) and Midsummer Night's Dreameight or so times. And I've ignored plenty of Hamlets and Bottoms over the years while I would jump at adecent Henry VI  just to get it under my belt. Like Falstaff, my appetite for drama is prodigious.
Of course individual History Plays are popular. But these cycles of four or eight of them done in repertoryseem to be lifting the status of the work as a whole higher and higher. As a singular accomplishment in hisremarkable body of drama, the eight parts (plus the spin-off Merry Wives,  another one I've never seen) loom
larger and larger. They're getting more attention, more academic study and most importantly they're beingperformed more.
If you can, see them all before they're gone come May 1st because how often does one even get the chance?
If you can only see one, well Richard II  boasts an excellent star turn by David Tennant. Henry IV  is dominated
not by Falstaff (thanks to a more nuanced and real Sher in that usually too boisterous role) but by theensemble as a whole, with the tavern scene where Prince Hal plays his stern father and Falstaff plays thewayward youth an especially vivid success. And Henry V  is a slap-dash crowd pleaser, as usual.
Director Gregory Doran keeps flourishes to a minimum. What you get here are clear, unfussy presentations ofthe plays, not any interfering vision overlaid on top of what Shakespeare already offers. As a result, none ofthe plays wow but there is a certain cumulative effect with vivid impressions remaining after all is said anddone. Tennant is very good indeed, with his dawning realization of how poor a king he's been the real tragedy
at hand since it comes too late. (Though I think the trendy habit of showing Richard's "special" friend the Duke</p>
<p>of Aumerle as his murderer cheapens the ending and that character's story.)
Sadly, Tennant is only in Richard II , whereas Sam Marks is allowed to shine in all three dramas. His scene of
intimacy with the King as the Duke of Aumerle is a highpoint of that piece. And there Marks is again as Ned
Poins, one of Prince Hal's ne'er do well pals, proving yet again an honest friend of sorts, though this timeroyalty will abandon him instead of the other way around. And finally he's on the side of the French in Henry V,frustrated by the foppish Dauphin (Robert Gilbert in a too-silly wig), making yet another strong impression in asmaller role. If Julian Glover and Oliver Ford Davies effortlessly show why they've had substantial careers,Marks shows why he by all rights should in the years to come. Also making a strong impression in a generallyexcellent cast is Matthew Needham in the usually one-note role of Hotspur. Yes, he's still fiery in temper butNeedham makes this Harry a compelling, complex, endlessly interesting figure.
The other notable flourish in the first show was a score featuring three sopranos that was especially striking.
(Charlotte Ashley, Helena Raeburn and Alexandra Saunders did the honors.) Boldly, the launch of the Henriadbegan with some five or ten minutes (or so it seemed) of their glorious singing. The sound and setting was soimpressive it made me long for some programs of similar music at the BAM Harvey in the future. Sadly, thismusical signature was not maintained. Henry IV  had no vocals and Henry V  mostly used music for martial
effects (naturally) and as comic relief.
Henry IV  was where the grand ensemble of the RSC came into its own, the broad canvas filled to bursting with
strong performers. Falstaff is a fail-safe crowd pleaser and one could say Antony Sher was born to the play
the role. But that would be redundant since Sher is born to play pretty much any role he fancies. Here Sherdoesn't woo the audience and neither does he play the fool. Falstaff is more human, dirtier and less appealingwithout failing to let us see why Hal might tarry with him, for a while. A rascal? Yes, but not an inherentlycharming one. When his hand shakes with tremors while reaching for a drink, it's not played for easy laughsbut sounds a more pathetic note. This Falstaff's days are numbered, one knows from the start. That makes hisdeluded joy over Hal ascending to the throne a little puzzling at the end since this Falstaff may boast and bragbut he's always realistic. Sher moves you, but it's not an end that ties in with the man he's brought to life. It'sa little disappointing since one expects the world from Sher, but this more human Falstaff allows the play tostay focused on Hal's journey. Alex Hassell is a dashing fellow and here we see Hal come into his own in anatural and convincing manner.
That unfortunately dims the pleasure of Henry V  a tad. We've just seen Hal turn into the king and gain the
authority of the crown. But when Henry V  starts he has to do it all over again. Here, Henry V is seen as a tad
tentative, finding his way as king again. It's perfectly justified by the text, but one day after seeing the
character take a similar journey, it feels repetitive. Where's the man we saw ascend the throne with suchcertainty just 24 hours ago?
Perhaps to compensate, this Henry V  leans on the humor over-much. That has one good effect: the famed
speeches that pepper the show are set off to brilliant effect since so much of the rest is fairly low-brow in
comparison. Hassell is thoroughly in command as a warrior, all doubt and uncertainty set aside in the heat ofbattle. He's also completely in his element with the dessert that comes at the end of these four plays: thewooing of Katherine (a charming Jennifer Kirby). Hassell is romantic and amusing and sexy and has the crowdon his side with ease.
And how remarkable, in a way, for Shakespeare to have witty and amusing speeches delivered in French</p>
<p>during a play about defeating them in battle. How he humanizes the enemy in ways large and small (from the
admirable Mountjoy to Marks as the Constable of France). How he savors the glory of battle (the St. Crispin'sDay speech) cheek by jowl with its horrors and the recognition that the common soldier doesn't know aboutall those grand desires but simply wants to stay alive and get home in one piece, thank you very much.
An audience that tackles this marathon will surely feel the same way at some point in their journey. But when
it's over, like me they'll probably forget the muddy roads and hard campaigning and simply remember themoments that shone brightly.
