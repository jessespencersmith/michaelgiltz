Can Coens regain moio at Cannes?
o FrlmmakersEthanand
Joel Coen create a buzz at
the festrval that's been good
to them
ByMICHAET cILrZ
Special to thc StaTribue
m the Coen brothers do
it again? The TlYin Cil-
ies nativcs who have tri-
rmphed repeatedly at Cmnes
ae oncc rgain stirring talk of
behg in the hut for a maior
awud today.
That talk centers on "No
Coutry for Old Mer1" a hu-
mor-streal(ed drma about a
Buy (Josh Brolin) who stu-
bles upon a pilc of cash from
a drug deal gone bad md de-
cides to make the play of his
Iife Tomy Lee Jones is the
small-tom sheriff who loows
that Brolin is ia way over his
head. Neither of them couts
on Brolin behg tracked dom
by the relentless Anton Chigu
(a scene-stealing JaYier Btrdem
as a soulless killing ruchine).Ethm md Joel Coen ile debuting their latest, "No Coutry For Old
Men," at the 60th Cmes flIm fesUva.l.
And the Coens don't usual-
ly cout on outside materia.l.
But this movie (due out in the
United States this fall, perlEps
after playing the Toronto Filrn
Festival) is broed on a book by
trovelist Comac McCarthy, au-
thor of "Al1 the Pretty Horses"
md the curent apocalyptic
bestseller "The Road."
Usually press-shy md tac-
itun, the Coem were reluc-
tmt even to chdacterize what
McCuthy was thjnking when
they showed him the fnished
movte
"He sat tbrough the whole
thing," said Etha, the yomg-
er md slightly shorter broth-
er. "He didr't leave. He didn't
throw ulthing at the screen."
Joel jmped in with, "And
he d.idn't hit Ethm on the way
out."
As they've done since break-
ing out in 1984 with the shoe-
string noir drma "Blood Sim-
ple," the two brothers finish
each other's sentences md
mmage to keep a polite, low
profile while promoting their
quirky movies. Aad there's no
better place for them to begia
that work thm at Cmes.
"We've always gotten a gen-
erally friendly receptioq md
they've been generally good for
the movies," said Joel. "It's al-
so the kind of movies we make.
They may be ia one respect or
mother out of the mainstreu
md more difficult to Mket. Itneeds some attention md trac-
tion ftom a festival like Cmes.
In the corner we [work il], it
becomes importut.'' r: : 11'r
'Ablodydusic'?
The Coens' most recent
efforts, "Intolerable Cruel-
ty" (2OO3) md "The Ladykill-
ers" (2004), both scored ir
the $35 million to $40 million
ruge at the U.S. box office -
a decent uout for their off-
beat lilrns - but left critics
cold. "The Mm Who Wasn't
There" (2001) wm a critical fa-
vorite, but sold oDly $7 million
in tickets.
Despite a bleak oudook ud
dou ending, "No Country for
Old Men," which also stars
Woody Harelson, is so as-
sued md ftmy it seems likely
to gilner great reyiews md the
Coens' best box ofhce in ages
Viliety dubbed it "one oftheir
very best" and "a bloody cl*-
sic," md that praise has been
echoed throughout the festi-
val
So the Coens bring their
sta-studdcd, mbitious works
to Cmes, md Ciues retwns
the favor. Ttuee of their films
have won tJre festival's best-di-
rector awild ("The Mm Who
Wasn't The!e," I996's "Fugo"
md I991's "Barton Finh"
which also won the top prize,
the Pa.lme d'Or)
That acclaim is why their
relatively low-budget moviescm attract maior stils such s
George Cloouey md Brad Pitt,
who have both signed on for
the Coens'next proiect, "Bur
A-fter Reading."
"I cm't believe I'rn with the
Coens," Budem said, "I was in
the Toronto FiIm Festival in
2001with my fust movie [My
new agentl said, 'Who would
you lile to work with?' I said,
'The Coen brothers ' She said,
'WeU, that's not going to hap-
pen because they make Amer-
icm movies.' And now here I
m with them "
Chigur isn't described (be-
yond his icy blue eyes) or given
my background or history in
the book, so the Coens felt free
to hire Bildem. They gave him
a ridiculous pageboy haircut
that somehow is so awkwild
it makes Chigu all the morescary: A mm with such bad
hair clea-ly doesn't cee what
myone tbinks about hin
"I went to a trailer md I weDt
to the hairdresser ud they did
bop, bop, bop," saidBadem "I
saw these guys laug}iag their
eyes off, like crying. I said,
'What happened? Give me a
mirror.' I looked at it md said,
'OK, we've got a chilacter"'
Bddem's one reseFation?
He doesn't like violence, md
his chaacter is almost Termi-
mtor-like it his rutllessness.
"Let me tell you about Iavi-
er Budern " said Ethm. "I don t
loow what he told you It's true
he was initia-lly reluctmt, but
he wumed to it to m alm-
ing de$ee. He'd walk on the
set md go, A-a-a-right [clap-
ping hmds together with gleeJ,
who do we kill today?"'Iavier Bddem stils as a rutlless killer in "No Coutry for Old Men, "
which has already gmered pnise from audiences md qitics</p>
