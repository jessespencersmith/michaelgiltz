THEATER: Mike Birbiglia's "New" Baby
MIKE  BIRBIGLIA'S  "THE  NEW  ONE"  *** out of ****
CORT  THEATRE
I want to know as little about a show as possible before I see it. This
would be true even if I wasn't a critic. Ever since that Canadian kid
visiting South Florida for the summer blurted out to me that DarthVader was Luke Skywalker's father BEFORE I saw 
The  Empire  Strikes
Back,  I've been horrified by spoilers. ("Why? Why  did you tell me?")
Despite all this, I'm not a fanatic. On revivals, I'll perk up whenhearing details about their approach to a show, like the recentOklahoma at St. Ann's that included corn bread and chili during the
interval and a general picnic-vibe. Cool!
So I've seen Mike Birbiglia before, I knew his new show was about
becoming a father (the new one is a baby) and I heard...murmurings.
Comments. By and large, his stand-up persona is to self-deprecate;
most of Birbiglia's jokes are at his own expense, especially whendetailing the myriad medical issues that have bedeviled him. So itseemed out of character for such an everyman, relatable guy, but Ikept hearing he came across as a jerk. He crossed some line and risked
people...well, it wasn't that they wouldn't like him. They would hate
him. What a terrible person! Don't be that honest, Mike! WTF? Whatcould he have possibly said?
Well, it's not a spoiler, so I won't feel bad in telling you that during his
new show about being a new parent, Birbiglia confesses that being aparent is...really hard. Oh, he goes farther, but that's the gist of it. Infact, Birbiglia confesses it's so hard that -- and here he drops to thatconspiratorial whisper where you imagine he's speaking to you and
you alone -- that he understands why some men leave. (I'll admit, a
small ripple of astonishment spread through the audience at theperformance I attended.) Yeah, he gets it. Birbiglia immediatelyfollows that "confession" with a reassurance. He doesn't mind tellingus this because he knows: HE'LL NEVER LEAVE. Not a chance.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>Well, if that's bold, someone should have told the classic original
sitcom Roseanne or a thousand other TV shows where the parentscheerfully joked about dumping the kids and heading for the hills.Heck, even moms can feel sometimes it's a hell of a lot of work and
they've considered tossing in the towel. (Of course, women
abandoning their kids is somehow even more difficult for people toaccept, much as they understand it intellectually.) Now remember,we're not talking about adults leaving their kids on the side of the
road. We're talking about parents overwhelmed by the responsibility
and admitting to themselves and each other, "Wow. This is hard."
I never would have thought this was Lenny Bruce territory, deeply
confessional truth-telling that risked alienating an audience. And it
wasn't. The show I saw was warmly embraced and ended on just the
sort of awww emotional moment you saw coming a mile away but stillsort of bought since we're all suckers when it comes to the emotionalbond of parent and child.
[Here's Birbiglia on Jimmy  Kimmel  talking about his show.]
That's how the show ends. But it begins with a couch. In a nifty
throughline, Birbiglia charts his maturity through his couch, whichstarted with a beast he "rescued" off the street (his roommates gave
him an "awesome" and a thumbs up) and then progressed to deciding
he was going to go full adult and buy a new couch only to experiencesticker shock and finally discovering his beloved favorite couch (theplace he would collapse after weeks on the road doing standup) had
been commandeered by "the new one." And God help him if he
thought this was temporary.
Maturity becomes him, that's for certain. Birbiglia has a sad sack, Ray
Romano sort of vibe (he must have turned down sitcoms by now) withhis own sneaky delivery. He keeps calling his wife by the wrong name
(a hilarious distillation of male indifference; "oh, it's our anniversary?
"), bemoans any change, laughably thinks the fact that his wife sayingTHEATER: Mike Birbiglia's

<p>she didn't want kids when they got married meant she would NEVER
wants kids and generally rolls with the punches.
From frighteningly intrusive medical exams to discovering his sperm
don't swim to realizing he is NOT the most important person in theroom when the new one arrives, Birbiglia is in fine form. It's a story --not stand-up -- and he is ably supported by the sneakily simple set of
Beowulf Boritt, the lighting of Aaron Copp, the sound of Leon
Rothenberg (nicely invisible but crucial) and director Seth Barrish tobuild the story and use his distinctive delivery (an offhand commenthere, a mumbled punchline there) to share it rather than as a crutch.
You're never waiting for the jokes, which makes the jokes all the more
satisfying.
It's Mike Birbiglia's most satisfying show yet, which bodes well for his
next piece, The  Terrible  Twos.
