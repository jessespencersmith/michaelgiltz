directed by Andy Abrahams Wilson 
THIS SWEET "DOCU-D IARY" about 
32-year-old Andy Abrahams Wilson's 
visit to his grandmother in Florida was 
shot mostly with a handheld cameraÂ­
in Wilson's hands. We tag along as 
Andy and Bubbeh Lee go shopping in 
the local grocery store, chat about her 
Family's journey to America, and bump 
into countless friends and neighbors 
who remark on how wonderful "single" 
Andy is and how they have a 
granddaughter who would be perfect 
for hi m. Though Wilson's voice-over 
narration can be grating, the overall 
tone is gentle, even as they talk about 
13ubbeh Lee's unhappy childhood, her 
inability to show affection to her 
children, and her thoughts about Andy's 
being gay. When they're driving and she 
tells Andy to go straight and he makes 
the inevitable joke, her amused reaction 
makes even that chestnut a little fresher. 
(Airing on HBO through October 27.)
