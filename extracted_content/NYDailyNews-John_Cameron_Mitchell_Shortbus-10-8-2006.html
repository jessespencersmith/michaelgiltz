            <p>The new movie "Shortbus ," openingWednes­
day, is a valentine to New York --or at least, 
the idealized New York that exists in the 
minds of the dreamers who flock here from 
all OVer the country. It's a Ne,,' York where 
misfits and the lonely can connect up at 
events like the title gathering , a semiregular 
"happening" where a sex therapist who can't 
have an o!gasm and a gay couple who maybe want to 
spice up their relationship will be welcomed with very 
open arms 
"It's a New York film, but not in the sense that a 
Woody Allen film or a Martin ScorsE:se or even a Jim 
Jarrnllsch film is," says director John Cameron Mitchell, 
who made headlines 'around the world when he post-. 
ed a casting call looking for actors who were willing to 
have sex on camera for this non porno-
graphic drama 
"This is a real immigranrs tale, 
All these characters are immi­
grants Woody Alien is deal-
ing with the fact that all his rel­
atives are 111 the neighborhood 
and coming over to his house in 
the upper East Side_ In out' case, 
none of us really started her~ and 
maybe we still have it starry-eyed 
view of it " 
Mitchel! can be excused if the stars are 
still in his eyes His Off-Broadway musical "Hedwig and 
the Angry Inch" became a lel'it imate phenomenon that 
morphed into a successful, well-reviewed feature film_ 
Now he has followed it with "Shortbus " 
While making an independent film is never easy, 
the $2 million "Short bus" has overcome the timidity of 
investors and enjoyed a charmed, l'aptnrous premiere at 
Cannes, followed by more applause at the 10ronto Film 
Festival and now a homecoming to New York that feels right 
"I always Ileep my expectatlOns low so as not to be 
disappointed," says the 43-year-old Mitchell "But this 
has reall)' oLltstripped anything we could have hoped 
for Granted, we don't know what's going to happen na­
tionally. But "_ we're booked in over 60 theate!s around 
the country. INational theater ownels] are booking it 
because they 
really smell money And some of them are actually 
moved by the film, which is always good, too" 
For real-life New York couple Paul Dawson and PJ 
DeBoy -who play "the two Jamies" in the film and are e 
at the center of a three-way lhat includes the singing 
of ''The Star-Spangle d Banner" -watcl~ng peopl~ 
get into the spiritorthe film has been a kIck. D~Lte 
being tagged as controversIal. it has been Warn1lOg up 
audiences_ . 
"In Toronto, we saw it with two older women SI[' 
ting next to us," ays DeBoy, "When the first e~I~C ­
It scene came up. they said, 'Oh my God! l?at s dIS­
gusting!' And yet they were_thrilled about If. too, 
When the movie we gomg mto another sexual area, 
one would grab the other one and say, 'Here we gol' 
"I think when you give people a chance I be 
challenged, they welcome that challenge, " 
Opening the film here is the leasl stressful tage 
of the journey for Mitchell, be?,u e, b~ says, "Short­
bus· is wrapped up in everythmg the cuy stands for: 
"We love New York, and this fitm could not have 
been made anywhere else: says Mitchell, "Maybe 
artists are being slowly priced out ... but I g:1 a fee!­
ing of optimism when I see young people sttll movtng 
here because it's New York," •</p>
