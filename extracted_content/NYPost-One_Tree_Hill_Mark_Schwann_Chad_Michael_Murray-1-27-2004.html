'One Tree' out of 'Creek's' shadow 
By MICHAEL Gil TZ 
CHAD Michael Murray 
had that rare opportu­
nity for an actor: his 
choice of parts. 
After recurring roles on 
"Dawson's Creek," "Gil­
more Girls," and the ro­
mantic lead in what would 
turn out to be the smash 
hit film "Freaky Friday," 
Murray needed to 
choose between two 
new shows. 
Did he want to star 
as the moody rebel in 
Fox's summer series 
"The O.C."? Or did he 
want to star as the moody 
rebel on "One Tree Hill" 
on his old stomping 
ground, the WB? 
Murray chose "One Tree 
Hill." Then, of course, 
"The O.C." exploded into a 
pop-cultural phenomenon. 
"The first few weeks of 
the show," laughs creator Mark Schwahn, "I would 
only imagine that Chad 
figured he made a mis­
take." 
Indeed, "One Tree Hill" 
-the story of two high 
school rivals who find out 
they have the same father 
-opened to disastrous re­
views and poor ratings. (It 
airs Tuesdays at 9.) 
"The press was pretty 
brutal on us " says 
Schwahn. "A lot of people 
said, 'They're crying to 
reinvent "Dawson's 
Creek" , 
Even fans of the show 
wondered on websites 
how many episodes it 
would last before getting 
the ax. Four? Five? 
"Everyone was really 
panicky when the first rat­
ings came out," says the 
22-year-old Murray. "Ev­
eryone was just freaking 
out. Twas the only pers n 
that laughed. I laughed ab­
solutely hystcricai1y. I thought it was great! 
"Man, if we're going to 
suck, dude, I want to be at 
the bottom of the barrel so 
that we can climb up." 
lndeed, the ratings 
climbed steadily every 
week as viewers got to ee 
ba ketball-l ving Luke 
(Murray) fall for Peyton 
(Hilarie Burton), the girl­
friend of his spoiled, 
wealthy rival Nathan 
(James Lafferty) . Of 
course, things have 
changed since then; this is 
a soap, after all. 
"One Tree Hill" became 
a top-five hit for teenage 
girls (the WB's first and 
best audience), it hit a nit­
ings peak in late Novem­
ber before going on a two­
month hiatus and now the 
show is back 
Schwahn also happily 
details a number of key 
adjustments they made 
since its debut. 
First to be cut down? The countless scenes of 
basketball, though 
Schwahn says this /.las . 
more to do with therigbrs 
of filming them than~ny-
thing else. . .' 
They also sped up cer­
tain revelations to clear up 
the murky backs tory arid 
then lightened up the 
prom queen-like Peyton. 
"1 was a little urprised 
that the angst Peyton was 
displaying in the first few 
episodes got a negative re­
action" admits Schwahn. 
"But of course, she's at­
tractive to look at and 
she's in the middle of it all, 
so to have a 'woe is me' at­
titude really turned some 
people off." 
So now, with Murray hit­
ting all the teen magazines 
and ratings on the up­
swing, "One Tree Hill" 
looks set to settle in to 
being not a "Dawson's 
Creek" knock-off but .. , 
the new "Dawson's Creek"</p>
