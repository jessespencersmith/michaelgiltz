YANK! THE MUSICAL *** 1/2 out of ****
KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN
I first saw Yank!  in a tiny theater off off (off off) Broadway in Brooklyn back in 2007. It
was so good  (and its star, future Tony winner-to-be Bobby Steggert so appealing),
you just knew it would be staged again. Indeed. This story about a gay soldier who
falls in love during WW II has simply become better and better as it's been performedaround the country, culminating in an acclaimed Off Broadway run in 2010. A bruitedtransfer to Broadway sadly fell through but now the show's creators hope to ensure along life for their work by recording the all-important cast album. Hence a Kickstartercampaign which ends early Friday morning and is just a smidge away from success.
A cast album is vital to a show like this. It's the best way for people who didn't get to
see Yank!  to fall in love. It preserves the performances of the original talent and it will
spur more productions for years to come. This is a labor of love, of course, but it'salso a very entertaining and well-made show that deserves your support. Anyone who
has seen the show will surely step up. ( Here's a page devoted to reviews from its
various incarnations. ) If you haven't, you can learn about it and hear a bunch of songs
at the show's website.
And that Kickstarter campaign. This is one Kickstarter campaign that will really make
a difference for the future of this show. It's not just an easy way for some Hollywoodceleb to raise funds for a pet project; it's a lifeline for a very good musical thatdeserves to be seen again and again.
I'd love to see Steggert in this role again. (Instead, he'll be on Broadway this spring
playing the lead in the musical Big Fish .) But even if I do some day soon, I'd still want
the cast album as well.
THE CHEATERS CLUB  * out of ****
ABRONS ART CENTER
The Amoralists is an ambitious theater company  that proudly touted several
productions of the last few months as "the summer of the Amoralists." That sounds
like something you could support, especially after their production of Rantoul And Diereceived some strong reviews.
And what could be more amoral than the story of several siblings and a friend who
abscond to Savannah for a weekend of debauchery away from their spouses, anannual event to purge themselves of their wicked, wicked desires? That's the premise-- sort of -- for The Cheaters Club, but it turns out the most amoral thing happening isthe waste of talent.
Written and directed poorly by Derek Ahonen, the first act is a laborious set-up. You
get a framing device in which an out of work actor tells tourists about the hauntednight that occurs once every 333 years when spirits can take over a human body.Then we have the broadly lampooned, would-be adulterers who explain what they'reup to, check into the most haunted hotel in Savannah and have some drinks at theodd little bar featuring a drunken nun, a kooky character, an easily offendedbartender, a slatternly singer and a silent piano player.
Turns out all of this is utterly unimportant since the real focus of the play is actually on
the people running the hotel. The proprietress in particular wants a warm body so shecan bring back the spirit of her dead lover, a lover who is dead because she killed himin a fit of pique.May 13, 2014

<p>So the first act is intentionally played at a broad, sketch comedy level, setting up the
stories of all these cheaters who aren't even really what the play is about. The moreserious and more exhausting second act focuses on the elaborate scheme to bringback spirits, with the cheaters all but forgotten. We're told again and again what ishappening even though we've had no trouble figuring it out the first time. The laboredhumor of the first act somehow becomes a dim, happy memory since at least theywere trying to be entertaining. It's all so ineffective that when one of the siblingsreturned to the bar after a lengthy, unnecessary absence I was jolted because I hadentirely forgotten she was in the show. That happened again after the show wasfinally over -- but it wasn't, because I'd forgotten about the completely unnecessaryframing device of the out of work actor and the tourists, which was reprised so wecould be told again what we had just seen.
Literally dozens of people crowded the stage (26 in all) of the rather attractive theater
at the Abrons Art Center, which has the happy feel of a high school auditorium. The
set by Alfred Schatz was solidly impressive and did a good job creating the context for
everything from goofy comedy to supernatural chills. Also credit the lighting of Brad
Peterson. Among the actors, you have to admire those who manage to create
something out of such dire circumstances. Zen Mansley has the proper, ripeoveracting tone for this foolishness when playing the tour guide/unemployed actor. Hegets more laughs by playing it seriously than most of the actors do by playing it forlaughs. Sarah Lemp as the scheming hotel owner also creates the most believablecharacter (and most consistent accent). Jordan Tisdale also scores nicely in the dualrole of a nerdy cheater and then -- when possessed -- a very different man altogether.
Simply making such an elaborate play happen is an accomplishment in itself and
there's clearly talent involved onstage and behind. Here's hoping the fall or winter orspring of the Amoralists wil be more rewarding than this final offering of their summer.
