~y MICHAEL GILTZ'; 
In 1986, when comedian Jay 
Leno was selling out Carnegie 
. '. Hall, appearing on Late Night with 
. . .David Letterman more than any 
other guest and generally hitting 
the big time, a producer for the 
CBS newsmagazine West 57th 
Street decided to trail Leno and 
get "the real scoop." .. 
When the producer was unable. 
to unearth anything (Leno doesn't 
drink or do drugs, and he isjust as 
...... friendly 9ffstage as he is on), West 
:::-;.'; 57th Stredaired a segment on the 
. stand-up comic that would make 
Mr. Go'odwrench .look a little shif­
ty in comparison . 
It appears Leno is just an ordin­
ary, nice guy. 
r. Ironically, that is what makes· 
Ilim so unique among today's 
crowded field of comedians. In a 
time when every jokester worth 
his salt has a "hook" or "catch 
phrase" -Sam Kinison screams, 
Steven Wright mumbles and 
Howie Mandel gurgles -Leno is 
simply ... well, funny. 
Leno will bring his uniquely 
. normal brand of humor to Gator 
Growl this October. It is the lar­
gest "student-run pep rally in the 
wodd, but the prospect of per­
forming in front of more than 
_AO 10,000 people does not seem to 
daunt him. 
"I'll be there at the Gator 
Growl!" he barks like a carnival 
shyster. _ 
When told this was presumably 
the largest audience he would ever 
face, Leno said, "Well, I've got 
that thing in Red Square." 
Will he be doing anything diffe­
rently from his regular shows? "6~~'i~usly, you do BIG 
JOKES!" Leno said, laughing . 
"No, it'll be fun, a nice intimate 
thing. I'll get to do my disappear­
ing dime trick. It'll be great." 
If past experience is any indica­
tion, it will be great. 'Leno per­
formed at the 'O'Connell Center 
about two years ago :and' his two­
hour show was ecstatically re­
ceived. 
His wry, insightful style ca~ best 
be described as the opposite of 
Don Rickles': Rather than insult­
ing people and putting them 
down, he treats them as equals. 
Leno lets his audience in on the 
joke, and together they laugh at 
how silly the rest of the world can 
be. 
One of his favorite topics is TV 
Guide, the most widely read publi­
cation in the country. 
"Since when is TV Guide litera­
ture?" Leno (and his' audience) 
groans. " 'Honey, when are you 
gonna stop reading and come to 
bed?' 'Just a couple of more hours, 
dear. I want to see who's on Cross 
Wits for the rest of the week.' " 
It's funny stuff, and it. doesn't 
hurt that the man delivering it has 
a likeable mug that resembles no­
thing so much as Dudley Do­
Right come to life. That mug soon 
will be appearing at a theater near 
you, for Leno was giving this 
telephone interview from the set 
of Collision Course, his third film 
and first starring role. He had two 
small parts in The Silver Bears and 
American Hot Wax. 
"It's a movie with Pat Morita 
(of Karate Kid fame)," Leno exp­
lains. "Collision Course is a 
comedy/adventure .. .I guess in the 
vein of Beverly Hills Cop. "I play an American detective 
and Pat plays a Japan.ese detec­
tive. Hey, there's a switch," he 
continues jokingly. "I'm investi­
gating one crime, Pat's investigat­
ing another crime and they're re­
lated, so we keep bumping into 
each other all the time." 
But d(m't worry. Even though 
Leno wouldn't mind working on 
more films, he has no intention of 
being lured to the bright lights of 
Hollywood and abandoning his 
live shows. 
"Yeali," he said, "if it's a good 
movie, I'd like to do more. But 
movies are a lot of work. They're 
not as much fun as doing your act. 
I prefer being a stand-up come­
dian, if only because comedy is so 
much fun when you're doing it. 
"When you're making a movie, 
it's not really fun because you do it 
eight different ways. You do the o 
. 'Comedy is like sex. If 
it's good, you want 
to do it again. If it's 
bad, you go 
"Uuuoooh." 
-JeyLeno 
master shot, the reverse (shot) and 
all that kind of stuff and it takes 
hours and hours to do it. And you 
have to wait six months to a year 
to find out if the movie's funny-, 
whereas in comedy you do the 
joke right away (and get a reac­
tion). 
"When you do a joke while 
filming a movie, you go, 'Hmm, 
that's kind of funny,' and the crew 
kind of laughs but you never really 
know," he said. . 
"Movies are fun after you've 
done them. It's fun to sit in a 
restaurant and have people go, 
(squeals of delight) 'Oh, we just 
saw your movie,' and you go, 
(aloof and self-satisfied) 'Oh, re­
ally?'" 
Leno's nice-guy persona and 
razor sharp comic delivery make to believe Leno when he says that 
success on the silver screen won't 
change him. 
At a stage in his career when he .. 
could limit himself to select ap­
pearances in big auditoriums, 
Leno chooses to tour constantly. 
He usually does about 300 shows 
a year. True, Leno can command 
S15,000 a shot at the larger ve­
nues, but you get the distinct im­
pression he is just as happy per­
forming at a Kiwanis Club lun­
cheon as at Carnegie Hall. 
Leno says when he plays at an 
out-of-the-way town, "People 
walk up to me and say, 'What the 
hell are you doing here?' But this is 
what I do. I enjoy doing shows. 
When people have a funny story 
to tell, they run around the office 
-or wherever it is -and they
