2/02/2005 10:35:00 PMJust wanted to add my comments to John's above.1. ABC is treating the Iraqi woman hugging the poor mother ofthe dead Marine as an iconic, defining moment that crystallizeseverything Bush wanted to say and what he is trying to do inIraq. Cokie Roberts acted as if the spontaneous hug wasvirtually miraculous. Anyone who WOULDN'T comfort theparents of a dead soldier would be miraculous, IMHO. It doesnot define or justify Bush's handling of Iraq. It's just commondecency.2. Bush lied about Social Security -- it is NOT going "bankrupt."It can go 40 years without changing one thing and providemore benefits than the plans put forward by Republicans. If thevery cautious estimates about the economy are exceeded, itmay be even stronger -- all without building up trillions ofdollars in debt in order to encourage people to save more.Bush's lies were fear-mongering. Social Security can betweaked. It is not in crisis. At least the Dems grumbled. Bushlisted a string of people who have made suggestions about howto keep Social Security solvent beyond the 40 years in thefuture it is already assured of. It was notable that he still hasn'toffered a plan of his own.3. What does giving immigrants temporary worker permitshave to do with keeping out drug dealers and terrorists? Bushloves to push one plan by pretending it tackles a problemutterly unrelated to it.4. Bush made "duty" sound like "doody."5. My favorite moment -- watching Bush belittle the vicepresident's daughter by saying her relationships are a threat tosociety. Republicans cheered and Cheney had to just sit thereand take it. At least he didn't applaud.The Dem response is putting me to sleep.
