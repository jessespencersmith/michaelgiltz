3/25/2005 01:17:00 PMYes, the LA Times is refusing to give equal times to alternatetheories of evolution. Today they printed a story claiming thatsoft tissue was found in the bones of a dinosaur that died some70,000,000 years ago. There isn't ONE WORD from opposingscientists who would argue that the universe was created some30,000 years ago and that the bones of dinosaurs were placedthere by our Creator to test our faith. Why does the LA Timeshate religion?
