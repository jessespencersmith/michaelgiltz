 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: Edgar Oliver Holds Forth;
Grace Is Denied
HELEN & EDGAR  *** out of ****
GRACE  * 1/2 out of ****
HELEN & EDGAR  *** out of ****
THEATRE 80 AT ST. MARK'S PLACE
Have you ever felt that you arrived late to the party?
That's certainly the feeling I got at the performance of
the one-man show  Helen & Edgar.  Star Edgar Oliver
walked out onto the stage and the applause was warmand happy; this was clearly an old friend to most of the
people attending. He began and they were immediately
caught up, laughing quickly and sharply, knowing his style, his quirks, his obsessions... and loving them.
Oliver is a mainstay of The Moth , a long-running storytelling showcase that also launched a radio series.
This new show focuses on his childhood with Edgar, his sister Helen and their... unconventional mother.
Make that, nutty as a fruitcake, smothering, needy, obsessive, destructive, frightened and yet somehowmemorably eccentric and delightful, as long as you're hearing about life with her rather than actuallyliving it.
They are ensconced in Savannah, Georgia, a city that is a trap, their mother warns them. You can try to
leave Savannah but it won't have it and lures you back in, slowly but surely. They share one bedroom in adilapidated old house, their father long dead of a heart attack (or so they're told). The dark frightensthem all so they sleep together in one upstairs bedroom, each with their own single bed and each bedpointing in its own eccentric direction. Mother demands constant affirmation from Helen and Edgar, any
interloper is the enemy -- family most of all -- and driving here and there to sketch the run-down sections
of the city is their main pursuit.
Outside contact is thoroughly discouraged, though Helen and Edgar occasionally make forays into the
world, perhaps a picnic at the beach with a schoolmate or simply running away late at night, with their
mother in hot pursuit, determined to drive the kids and their bicycles off the road rather than let them
escape. Summers involve a planned trip to the far north reaches of Baltimore, but Mother invariably getsMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>frightened of family and stops in D.C., where they linger as long as possible before timidly setting forth
again or scurrying on home. The children rebel by learning to speak French and speaking it to each other
in front of their mother, who can't understand a word. It's that kind of family.
This is all presented in short vignettes. Oliver comes to the microphone, his arms curled up towards his
chest in modest pleasure, his eyes twinkling with delight that you've come to see him again. His sonorous
voice begins to tell a tale, a short story about that picnic on the beach or the itinerant worker who kept
returning to their house demanding he be hired to clear away the clumps of ivy that are enshrouding
their home, ivy anyone else would consider a pest but which Mother (and therefore the children) prize
above all else. Between tales we see photographs of his family or paintings (by Oliver? his mother? who
knows) flashing on the wall behind them, two or three evocative images before fading to black, when he
returns to the mike.
Oliver's voice is a curious thing, beautiful sounding and vaguely foreign. (The way he pronounces "car"
and numerous other words sounds more like Bela Lugosi than anything else I can think to compare it to.)It's hard to know how much of his autobiographical work is embellished but it's very easy to believe that,
growing up in Savannah, people would constantly say, "You're not from around here, are you?" and insist
he must be from somewhere like Transylvania until eventually he just began agreeing with them that yes,
he and his sister were from Transylvania.
I assume some of the tales (three in the first act and two in the second) have appeared before. Oliver's
stories here seem ideally suited to the radio or an evening of storytelling. I can imagine hearing all sorts
of tales and having Oliver step in for 15 or 20 minutes, casting his spell and winning the strongest
applause of the night. Strung together into an entire evening, however, the stories began to blur a bit.Just as some short story authors are best read in short bursts of one or two tales so you don't diminish
their power, Oliver's stories in this evening would undoubtedly be more powerful when not heard all at
once. There's a sense of conclusion in the final tale, but it's modest and the other works could probably be
performed in any order without anyone being the wiser.
That said, as my first exposure to Oliver I enjoyed myself immensely and each tale on its own was
certainly vivid and memorable. His talent is unique and clear. Here's a clip of Oliver telling another storyabout his mother. This time he and his sister are returning home to bury her. It gives you a sense of the
spell he can cast though, naturally, it's far more effective in person.
GRACE  * 1/2 out of ****
CORT THEATRE
I have little to say about Grace  because it inspires very little thought. The story is a familiar one in its
way, of financial crisis and faith and personal redemption. Whatever the faults of this production of the
play by Craig Wright, they are certainly not found in the fine cast, the striking staging by Beowulf Borittor the direction of Dexter Bullard. It's all in the text or, more to the point, it's not in the text.
Paul Rudd, appealing as always even when playing a subtly unlikable guy, is a fervent Christian who has
moved to Florida to roll the dice on his dream project: a chain of Bible-based motels, complete withPromise Keepers tie-ins, a baptismal pool and so on. "Where would Jesus stay?" is the tacky slogan. Hiswife is the sweet and understanding Kate Arrington but it only takes a few short, sharp words to see how
Rudd keeps her in her place and has an explosive temper. (Which he always immediately apologizes for.)
After a phone call or two, we realize the deal is falling through and that Rudd is on the hook for a lot ofdebt. That does nothing to calm his nerves.
Their neighbor is Michael Shannon and, in one of many lengthy monologues, we hear his complicated
tale: he's a tech geek of some sort who was married but a horrible car accident left Shannon disfigured
and his wife dead. We learn that from Ed Asner, the grumpy German pest control guy who keeps roamingtheir apartments and spraying pesticide. He has his own convoluted tale about the Holocaust, a storywhich prompts Rudd to his knee-jerk reaction of proselytizing. His wife's hesitation every time helaunches into his spiel (invariably a poorly judged moment) and her unhappily submissive response to his
outbursts set the stage for the obvious: a growing intimacy with the damaged, needy, but essentially kind

All of this is laboriously spelled out and essentially uninteresting. Asner's monologue about the Holocaust
is pretty much like countless other tales of woe that sprang from the war and that particular horror.
Shannon's story of loss is similarly vague and generalized, with nothing to distinguish it from many
others. Even Rudd's faith and the lack of faith of others isn't terribly detailed or interesting. And I am
partial to such topics, and happy to see here it's not a tale of hypocrisy as such when it comes to religion.
Rudd may be terrible at winning over people to Jesus, but his desire is real.
It all fails to build to a climactic finale revealed in the very first scene: in it, we get a "rewinding" of the
action, like a movie shown in reverse. We see bodies slumped on the floor, then we see Rudd kill himself,
then we see him kill his wife and then kill their neighbor. It's a clever, striking moment and the only one
in the show. A similar rewinding is done late in the play for absolutely no discernible purposedramatically or emotionally.
Another decision doesn't quite work either. We're told in the show notes that the action takes place in
two identically furnished apartments, which means one set with actors criss-crossing each other thoughthey're not in the same space. Early on this is just confusing when we think Harrington is barging intoShannon's home. Very little is made of this occupying of the same space and it proves more distractingand lazy than anything else. Ditto the undistinguished sound design of Darron L. West. Still the set (with
an oval sky in the background and doors and windows that slide slowly from one side to the other when
necessary for the action) is handsome in its own terms.
Ultimately, none of it engages our interest and a late revelation from Asner strains credulity and makes
the use of the Holocaust as anecdote even more questionable. We don't buy the breakdown that Rudd is
driven too, either. Financial collapse and your wife's emotional betrayal should be plenty to break anyonebut Rudd's violent outburst depicted in the beginning is never earned. Grace  is lacking, simple as that.
