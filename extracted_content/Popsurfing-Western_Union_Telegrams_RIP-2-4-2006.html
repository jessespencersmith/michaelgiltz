            <p>S AT U R D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 4 ,  2 0 0 6Western Union Telegrams: RIPThis Independent profile of playwright Edward Albee -- timed to theLondon premiere of the marvelous revival of Who's Afraid of VirginiaWoolf? starring Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin -- casually mentionsthat Albee once worked as a messenger for Western Union. And thatreminded me of a one-line item I saw in the paper this week: WesternUnion has discontinued telegrams and will focus only on wiring money.After 150 years, the telegram is no more. What will people make of TheHuman Comedy starring Mickey Rooney (or the book by WilliamSaroyan)? Who will explain to people the shots in films of someonewandering through a hotel lobby saying, "Telegram for Mr. Smith. Mr.Smith? Telegram?" Sad.BONUS: What was the text of the very first telegram (sent by SamuelMorse)? It was: "What hath God wrought?"POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

NYCD Online said...I still remember the only two telegrams I ever got -- both in the late'70s, both at sleepaway camp in the Catskills. One was from mygodparents, wishing me a happy 10th birthday, and the other was frommy mom, just looking for an interesting way to say hello.Unfortunately, because they came to the front desk at camp, I never gotto tip the Western Union guy, which was part of the whole experience, Isuppose.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
