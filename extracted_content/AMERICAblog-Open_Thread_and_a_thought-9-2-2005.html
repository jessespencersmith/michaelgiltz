9/02/2005 01:40:00 PMI'm as happy as anyone to watch Ted Koppel blast the head ofFEMA with tough reasonable questions. But really, doesn't hehave a spokesperson or something? It's important tocommunicate with the media and the public at large, butshouldn't the HEAD of FEMA be too busy to sit down for dozensof interviews every day? File this thought under the damned ifyou do and damned if you don't category.
