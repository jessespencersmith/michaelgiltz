            <p>ollywood loves a biker gang - nothing
gives small-town America a shiver
dowo its spine like a bunch of Hells
Angels tooling into town o$.ther big
choppers promising mayhem and destruction.
It began with Marlon Brando in 1954's "The
Wild One" - though we would later find
out that the "dangerous" pretty boy Brando
played could be placated with a plate of
doughnuts.
Biker heroes found their ultimate
expression in "Easy Ridei'(1969), Dennis
Hoppefs revolutionary ode to the
counterculture. The new flick "Hell Ride,"
opening Friday, is a rnodern biker movie with
Hopper in the cast for street cred. But too often
Hollywood thinks a noisy engine and a leather
jacket are all you need to be tough. Here are
some examples that'ended up with flat tires.

steamy mist as Mutt Williams, to claim the
mantle of adventurer from his mom's old
boyfriend - some geezer named Indy. Mutt
isn't impressed.
Grazy or oddly: Cuddly. Despite a costume
stolen almost stud for stud frorn Brando's getup
in "The Wild One." LaBeouf looks more like ai. little road trip - in other words, over-

hurt yourself, grandpa," is the thought
most moviegoers kept having. Travolta
could maybe pull it off, but not with that
gang backing him up.

bi-ooding, dangerous outlaw with a

would be scared of a guy on a
motorcycle ever again.
