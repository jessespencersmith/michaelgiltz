THEATER: A Bright Future In Reach For "Chasing
Rainbows"
CHASING  RAINBOWS:  THE  ROAD  TO  OZ  *** out of ****
PAPER  MILL  PLAYHOUSE  
Newsies.  A  Bronx  Tale.  The  Bandstand.  Honeymoon  In  Vegas.  Paper
Mill Playhouse is a powerhouse when it comes to launching new
musicals to Broadway. So naturally, the world premiere of a showabout Judy Garland's journey from vaudeville to a starring role in
MGM's The  Wizard  Of  Oz  raises one big question. Is Chasing
Rainbows  ready for Broadway? Absolutely.
They've got a great cast, make smart use of classic tunes, deliver some
rousing choreography, tell a good story and -- most of all -- have a star
in the making. Ruby Rakos acts sweetly, dances winningly and then
sings with a voice that immediately relaxes anyone worried aboutsome kid measuring up to one of the great entertainers of all time. Canshe belt 'em out like Garland? You bet. It's easy to picture the amiable,
entertaining, family friendly  Chasing  Rainbows  on Broadway as is.
Rakos could be reliving Garland's first triumphs on the Great White
Way just as Renee Zellwegger is in movie theaters depicting Garland'slast triumphs in the bio-pic Judy .
So the yellow brick road is tantalizingly in view. But if ChasingRainbows  wants to succeed  on Broadway, they've got work to do.
The story begins right at the climax, with Judy Garland, the smalltown girl with a big voice finally putting on the red shoes of Dorothy
Gale. She's about to tackle the lead role in a movie based on the Harry
Potter of its day, one of the best-selling books of all time. And Judy isthe star! Not just Mickey Rooney's sidekick, not just a co-star, but thehonest-to-goodness star. How did she get here?
The show immediately jumps back to a black-and-white childhood,
thanks to sepia-toned sets and photo-backdrops that paint theMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On
Shaky Ground</p>
<p>monotone world Garland grew up in as Frances Gumm. Her family are
entertainers, complete with a stage mother of a mom, a cheerleader of
a dad and three sisters who can sing and dance with the best of 'em.
But Frances is the star and everyone knows it. They're leaving theirhometown and excited by the prospect of California. So it barelyregisters on little Frances that some of the local men are glowering ather dad. The Gumms are choosing to leave, but it's clearly under a
cloud as dad's awkwardly emotional goodbye to another man hints at
problems to come.
Chasing  Rainbows  captures the travails of an "ordinary" girl next door
striving to become a star in the movies. (It helps to be one of the most
talented people on the planet.) But it also lasers in on the deep lovebetween Frances and her dad Frank (Max Von Essen). As with somany men in her life, Frank is gay, causing tension in the family andcreating one of many roadblocks on the way to Oz.
So the Gumms jump in their car and head to...well, not Hollywood,
but a town just a few hours from Hollywood where Frank bought atheater/movie palace as a base of operations. That's close enough forFrances!
Before you know it, she's closer and closer to stardom. Despite being
told a hundred times by every man and woman in sight that she's no
looker, too fat, an ugly duckling, plain, boring, etc., Frances somehowends up at MGM. She befriends a swell, gawky young guy at the studioschool for budding talent and he turns into Mickey Rooney. After a
road trip to the World's Fair to work the crowds, a few radio slots and
some canny support from studio head Louis B. Mayer's secretary,Frances Gumm soon turns into Judy Garland.
But she's still not a star, not even close. With the future bombshell
Lana Turner and budding sensation Deanna Durbin as classmates, is it
any wonder Judy starts to believe she'll never make it? (In real life,Elizabeth Taylor was also a classmate, enough to make anyone else inthe world feel dumpy.) Dad's her biggest fan, but he's stuck in thattown a few hours away, drawn into yet another doomed and forbidden
romance. Mom is quietly dating as well. Her sisters long for a real life.
And Mickey Rooney seems to be hitting on every woman in Hollywoodexcept  Judy. Maybe she doesn't even want to date him herself. But it
sure would be nice to say no.
And just when her dream project of The  Wizard  of  Oz  is announced as
an upcoming MGM movie, they also announce its star: Shirley Temple.
Judy is heartbroken. Again. We know she's going to sing "Over TheRainbow" by the end of the night, but how exactly will she get there?THEATER: "The Glass

<p>Recap the complicated plot of this smoothly performed show and you
realize how much ground they cover. A family's travails, the studiosystem and the chaotic production history of The  Wizard  Of  Oz  are all
deftly interwoven, but that's just the start. A closeted dad, a growingdependency on pills to battle weight, a young woman's desire for alittle romance and a starlet's yearning for the spotlight are also in themix, along with Mickey Rooney, Roger Edens (an MGM talent whoalso championed Judy) and Louis B. Mayer, here showing an inabilityto realize what a gem he's got. They casually toss in more: the
profitable and corny Andy Hardy series of movies, the way a studio
party could help launch a career and Mayer's sharper-than-sharpsecretary/right hand woman Kay Koverman are all convincinglybrought to life.
And did we mention this is a musical? A few serviceable new numbers
pop up for specific scenes, especially early on. But mostly the showcannily works in classic fare, including "Bill" from the musical Show
Boat,  old warhorses like "All God's Chillun Got Rhythm" and Garland
signature numbers like "Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart," "Dear
Mister Gable," and of course "Over The Rainbow."
The book by Marc Acito weaves them in nicely, along with hints of
other songs from The  Wizard  of  Oz.  Full credit to David Libby, who
adapts the music into all sorts of new situations and providesadditional music as well. The entire show was conceived by Tina MarieCasamento, who also delivers some additional lyrics. Normally I'dbeware of someone's passion project, but she poured her heart andyears of her life into this and it paid off.
Director Denis Jones keeps the elaborate story moving swiftly from
start to finish and also delivers some top-notch choreography. Hepeaks with three big numbers: a school house jam called "All Ma'sChildren;" a playful performance of "Swing, Mister Mendelssohn," in
which Mickey and Judy struggle to teach the operatic Deanna Durbin
how to play with the beat on a number; and a tap-dancing finale thatwows.
The lighting by Japhy Weideman is also key on that last number,
adding nicely to the intensity of the moment. Throughout, the colorful
and character-specific costumes of Linda Cho, the hard-working setsof Alexander Dodge and the other tech elements carry the story along</p>
<p>with them. One expects a Broadway-ready production from Paper Mill
and it delivers here, including a 14 piece orchestra led by conductor
Lawrence Yurman that sounds even bigger. And the cast is prettymuch flawless.
Max Von Essen is endearing as Judy's loving, troubled dad and Lesli
Margherita equally memorable as a mom who keeps her eye on the
prize of stardom without ever letting us doubt she loves Judy just asmuch. Indeed, her role might easily have played as a heavy or fadedinto the background with so much emphasis placed on the bond
between father and daughter, but Margherita's innate warmth shines
through. Their relationship is complicated but never maudlin ortragic, no small feat.
Karen Mason scores with two plumb parts: a quick but vivid turn as
the teacher in that studio school and as Mayer's very savvy secretary.Her big number lets Mason paint the picture of how some smartwomen navigated Hollywood: they pushed for what they believed inand left enough room for the men to believe it was their idea all along.Colin Hanlon is right there with her as Judy's other supporter Edens.
A handsome fellow, he also endures Cho's one big misstep in
costumes: maybe the grey slacks and red shirt and scarf he sports atone point is historically accurate, but it sure doesn't do him any favors.When Judy sports something unflattering, the show is making a point.
Hanlon deserves to look more dashing.
Michael Wartella is goofily winning as Mickey Rooney. He drums with
authority, dances with pleasure, sings with pep and utterly convincesas a rising young talent. It's a miracle Judy never points out theobvious: how come guys don't have to be matinee idols to be stars?And yet Wartella has the magnetism of a love interest both onscreen
and off.
Stephen DeRosa is not too broad as studio head Louis B. Mayer, a
mensch, if a little slow on the uptake. Violet Tinnirello does a wicked
little spin on Shirley Temple. (Though I think Rooney's taunting of her
in "This Is A Happy Little Ditty" should be tweaked to be more likefriendly teasing than disgust.) And on and on the list goes, from Judy'stwo sisters (played by two sets of fine actresses) to Christina Maxwellas Deanna. She too might have over-played this operatic teen star as
the butt of jokes. Instead, director Jones ensures everyone is playing a
real person instead of a punchline.
Above all, there's Ruby Rakos as Judy Garland. She's poked and
prodded and overlooked by the studio system. She sings and dances
and then sings again, all in numbers made famous by one of thebiggest talents we've ever seen. And you never doubt for a second she'sturning into that powerhouse star. Sure, the voice can belt out, butRakos also captures little things like the "cascading" style Judy often
used and the focus on lyrics that made her much more than a little girl
with a big voice. Her character is indeed "In Between" (a song Judy</p>
<p>sang in one of her Mickey Rooney movies, bemoaning the fact that
she's not a little kid but not yet a woman either). Here, Judy is on her
way to stardom, but still Daddy's little girl. Rakos embodies that
without ever making Judy too babyish or too mature.
So what's wrong? What needs fixing? Not a lot in terms of the basic
bones of the show, but plenty needs tightening and cutting
throughout. First, the very name of the show reveals a lack of
confidence. Call it Chasing  Rainbows,  not Chasing  Rainbows:  The
Road  To  Oz.  That subtitle makes it sound educational, just one step
away from calling it   Chasing  Rainbows:  The  Road  To  Oz  --  The  Story
Of  Judy  Garland  and  How  She  Came  to  Star  in  The  Most  Beloved
Musical  Of  All  Time.  If your audience isn't already aware of what
Chasing  Rainbows  is about, adding in The  Road  To  Oz  won't make
any difference.
The framing device is also unnecessary. The show begins with Judy
putting on the ruby red shoes of Dorothy and hinting at the Big Songin the finale. It's redundant. Again, your audience knows where it'sheaded: the entire show is about her getting the lead in 
The  Wizard  Of
Oz. So don't waste their time by telling the audience the one thing they
already know: she gets the part. Indeed, Judy's childhood is a morecompelling start since that's precisely what most people aren't familiar
with. Plus, too many songs and bits of dialogue throughout make
reference to rainbows and showers and the like. A little bit of that goesa long way.
The Shirley Temple bit is funny and allows a good joke when it comes
to the casting of Wizard . But her character is unnecessary in a show
which has so much going on. Yes, the "This Is A Happy Little Ditty"number works on its own, but it doesn't really move the story forward.We know Judy isn't a cute little moppet without needing an entire
number to prove it.
Further, the second act leans too often on details about the making of
The  Wizard  Of  Oz.  Sure, it's fun to run through all the script changes
that were added, dropped, added in again and then finally dropped.
But it's not necessary to the real story, which is about Judy's coming of
age as an artist, not rewrites. Do we really need to be told BuddyEbsen fell ill due to his Tin Man makeup and had to be rushed to thehospital? Not when you can read entire books sharing the same infoabout that and cut musical numbers like "The Jitterbug" and other
trivia.
So much info is stuffed into the second act, they lost track of Mickey
Rooney for a while. Just like the real Judy and Mickey, Rakos andWartella spark each other every time they're on stage. While Roger
Edens also has a role to play, that part feels too big when we're
wondering where the heck Mickey has gone too. They're too goodtogether.</p>
<p>A big montage towards the climax depicts all the swirling issues
bedeviling Judy. It's tricky, ambitious and convincingly done. But it
too is unnecessary.   The montage merely recaps the drama we've
already seen. A climactic confrontation between Judy and one of themovie's directors is all the drama we need to build to a big finish.
That big finish was teased at the beginning of course...and it's not
successful.
Judy is singing "Over The Rainbow" but she's also trying to convince
Mayer to keep the song in the movie. So she keeps stopping to explainhow good it is, telling us the song is both happy and sad at the same
time and why it's crucial to the film. But we know that! The monologue
states the obvious and  keeps Judy from delivering this classic number
in full. She sings and then stops to tell us how terrific it is and thenstarts and stops again, utterly frustrating the one moment we'veexpected all along: a beautiful version of a classic song, performed by agreat talent. Show, don't tell.
Besides, if she's going to convince Mayer how great the number is,
what better way than to just perform it? Sit him down at the lip of thestage with his back to the audience. Deliver the monologue if youmust, but put it all up front before the music begins. Let Judy sing thesong, for Pete's sake.
For added poignancy, they might have her dad stand behind Judy.
Indeed, the father's bond to his daughter is a constant in act one...andthen overdone in act two. Despite not being present in Judy's life
during act two, Dad is constantly present via clunky devices like
flashbacks and improbable duets and by simply bringing him on stage.We get the importance of their relationship from act one. And usingthat memory in act two will be a lot more powerful if it's donesparingly. The finale would be stronger if Judy sits Mayer down and
then faces him (and the audience) to make her plea. She delivers her
monologue while her dad silently steps up behind her. Sensing hispresence hovering nearby, Judy might even turn in his direction andsmile..and then launch into "Over The Rainbow" in one glorious take.
That brings us to the show's fatal flaw. It never gives Judy Garland or
Ruby Rakos her "star is born" moment. Again and again throughoutthe musical, she teases us with bursts of that powerful voice. Rakosjoins in with a group already singing or a big solo number isinterrupted by dialogue or cut short or joined in on by others. Big
moments become duets. Solo spots become family sing-alongs. When
Judy is delivering a gem during vocal lessons, her instructor bursts invocally to tell us he knows this kid is something special.
How about just letting her sing ? A big solo on "Zing! Went The Strings
Of My Heart" at the climax of act one is undercut by a medical crisis.
Her "Dear Mr. Gable" is truncated. Dad or Mickey or somebody  is
always joining in. Even "Over The Rainbow" is interrupted by Judy's</p>
<p>own gabfest.
Don't get me wrong. Rakos shines again and again. When she starts
swinging "All Ma's Children," the other jaded kids at MGM do adouble take with a look that says, "Hey, this one's got pipes!" She's
part of some great numbers. And the emphasis there is on parts .
Heck, it's possible Rakos doesn't sing a single song in full from start to
finish! ("Morning Comes" may be the exception.) That's crazy! SinceRakos clearly has the talent to put them over, it's all the more
frustrating.
Other issues have to be tackled, such as the lack of real drama in act
two. The show strikes one note: Judy isn't pretty enough to be a star.
And while intellectually we know she's having hit records and starring
in hit films, it doesn't feel that way. We learn the obstacles in act oneand virtually nothing changes in act two until the very end. A bettersense of Judy climbing one mountain after another, conquering radioand even starring in hit films would allow her frustration about notgetting that one big shot to stand on her own all the more palpable.
But first and foremost, allow her to sing. Give her the close-up in act
one. Let Rakos fully shine in a musical number and not with twentyother people sharing the spotlight. Create that magical moment wheneverything and everyone else drops away and we get a chance to cheerher and her alone.   And then do it again in act two. Let the audience be
on her side and they'll become just as frustrated as Judy waiting forMGM to see what they see: a star.
