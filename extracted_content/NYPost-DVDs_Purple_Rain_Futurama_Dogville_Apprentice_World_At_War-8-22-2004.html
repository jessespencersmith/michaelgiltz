Futurama Volume 4 
***1/2 
Fox, $49.98 
A bittersweet finale for 
"Futurama" fans. Matt 
Groening's follow-up to "The 
Simpsons" was treated with 
disdain by Fox, but gets the 
deluxe treatment on DVD 
(loads of commentaries and 
other extras) for the last 
episodes. For less 
intellectual yucks, --:."'~ ft'.i.'''' check out 
Hill: 
~The 
~ Naughty 
8 Early 
jg (A&E, 
~ $49.95) and 
~"The 
~ Munsters 
~ First Season" 
~ (Universal, $59.98). 
Dogville 
***1/2 Lions Gate, $26.98 
DIRECTOR Lars von Trier 
tricked people into thinking 
this absorbing, unusual drama 
about a woman (Nicole 
Kidman) hiding out in an 
isolated town from her 
gangster father is an anti­
American diatribe. In fact, 
everything, from the "Our 
Town" staging (the movie is 
filmed on a soundstage with no 
sets and minimal props) to the Purple Rain 
Special Edition 
*** Warner Bros •• $26.99 
YOU can't compare 
this 1984 hit with ''A 
Hard Day's Night," 
but when the so-so 
dramatics stop and 
the music starts, this 
is about as exciting 
as pop musicals get. 
Extras include mini­
documentaries, 
although there's no 
input from the 
Purple One himself. 
"Graffiti Bridge" of 
1990 and "Under The 
Cherry Moon" (1986) 
are also out; but the 
only really worthy 
companion is the 
raucous concert film 
"Sign 0' the Times," 
from 1987. 
fairy-tale narration by John 
Hurt, makes clear that this is 
about the dangers of 
dominating another human. 
The Apprentice/ 
The World At War 
**/**** UniversaI!A&E, $59.98/$149.95 
MOST reality shows 
aren't worth a second 
look once the finale is 
over, and "The 
Apprentice" is no exception . 
Still, potential contestants can 
check out advice from season­
one players. But a "reality" 
classic, the legendary 1973 
documentary "The World 
At War," will last ---- forever, with 26 
probing episodes, narration · by 
Laurence Olivier and 12 hours 
of extras. 
When The Mountains 
Tremble/Merton 
*** DocuRama, $26.95 
"WHEN The Mountains 
Tremble" is the 20th 
anniversary edition of a 
documentary about Nobel 
Peace Prize winner Rigoberta 
Menchu and the struggles of 
the Mayan population in 
Guatemala. And "Merton: A 
Film Biography" (1984), is a 
brieflook at the Trappist monk 
who garnered an audience with 
his many philosophical books.</p>
