10/14/2004 04:37:00 AMYep, George and Dick can't stop doing favors for Halliburton. Here's agood LA Times story about their latest favor: distorting science toapprove a technique for drilling owned by Halliburton that mightcontaminate our drinking water. Who cares if kids drinking dirty waterand get sick if it can help Halliburton?My favorite detail is about the panel that oversaw an EPA study thatits own employees have raised serious doubts over. Who was on thepanel, you wonder?"The EPA report was reviewed by a seven-person panel: a seniortechnical advisor at Halliburton, a manager from an industry-fundedresearch institute who previously worked for Halliburton, a seniorengineer with BP Amoco and two academics who had worked for theenergy industry. A sixth member, a state regulator with anengineering background, also had worked for Amoco. The finalmember was an expert on hydraulic fracturing from Sandia NationalLaboratories in New Mexico."Wow, talk about a balanced, independent panel. Will they be availableto oversee that Florida post-election fracas?
