THEATER: "Ink" -- The Art of Calligraphy,
Performance and Friendship
UNDER  THE  RADAR  FESTIVAL:  INK  --  A  PIECE  FOR
MUSEUMS  ** 1/2
THE  METROPOLITAN  MUSEUM  OF  ART
Have the performance duo/art experts James & Jerome  created   a new
form of lecture for museums around the world to adopt? A sort of Ted
Talk for tapestries and the like? Not really.   I mean, how many people
are out there who can hold a stage, speak authoritatively andentertainingly about art and art   history, weave in personal anecdotes,
compose beautiful music, play multiple instruments and dance with
insouciance? Heck, I'm not even sure James can dance with
insouciance, so it takes two here. With Ink , the combination of their
talents has created an engaging piece that surely will be welcome atmuseums around the world.
Their show is broken into five parts. Jerome Ellis kicks   things off with
the story of a sabbatical he took away from his friend and collaborative
partner James Harrison Monaco. Inspired by a book, Jerome decidesto make his own ink. Before you know it, we're off into the history of
ink and calligraphy and illuminated manuscripts, scored by music one
or both of them perform throughout and backed by projections ofvarious art pieces.
And it is a story. Jerome has a stutter and explains how early on in
their friendship he asked James to introduce Jerome to others, saving
him the hurdle of repeating his own name. "James gave me my nameback hundreds of times over the last ten years," he says. Just like that,they set a pattern.   A close but playful examination of a signature of
Suleiman the Magnificent flows into some hypnotic music which leads
to more personal comments (such as how the two bonded by spending
endless days at the Met soaking in their favorite works together) backMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

art history.
Is it an art lecture? A performance piece? A musical concert? Yes.

Jerome's stutter adds an element of drama to the show. Once the
audience realizes   he is not "performing" but simply working to
communicate with them, they are immediately on his side, rooting forhis thoughtful comments and compelling voice to come as easily as hewants, while patiently making mental room when it doesn't. (Anyonewho has seen the British performance artist and comic Daniel Kitson
will recognize this phenomenon.) James becomes a helpful
counterpoint, contrasting their styles of storytelling and giving bothJerome and the audience a breather. This only adds to the sense ofwarmth between them and the people hearing their story.
This is good since Ink  would otherwise lack tension and be merely a
lecture with modest anecdotes woven in. No natural suspense arises
from the stories shared or information presented, however compellingthey might be.
Naturally, their comments are illustrated throughout with images of
art. (Media Designer Shawn Duan is the third key element of theshow, which was directed by Rachel Tavkin and Annie Tippe.) FromPart II onward,   each piece of art projected on the screen was spoken
about directly or obviously related somehow to the moment. Not so inPart I, where Jerome   set up his story and their friendship while
seemingly random objects were displayed behind him. Undoubtedlythey have significance, but that remained   obscure at least to me. A
similar disconnect seemed to reoccur with the last few images of the
show, though that was so minor it just be my fault. The visuals   andBookFilter Reading List

<p>music came together perfectly however when Jerome would step in
front of the projections while dancing or playing an instrument,
literally becoming a part of the art they so love.
Lastly, an unintentional odd note was struck at the finale. Jerome said
something akin to, "I think I'd like to finish this alone" and James left
the stage. Clearly this was planned. Perhaps they have several optionsat the end, depending on the mood, their desire to change it up orJerome's   temperature-taking of how his speech is flowing and
whether he wants to tackle one final bit or pass it off? I've no idea butone thing is clear: James wasn't being "dismissed." But the way thattransition was voiced added a discordant note; it should be handleddifferently in the future.
Just as clearly, this piece will indeed have a future at any museum
James & Jerome  want to visit. The only pity is that those future
audience members won't be able to follow the show by immediatelyheading upstairs at the Met to check out most of the key piecesmentioned in person with a new appreciation.
