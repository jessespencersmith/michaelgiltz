WHEN William Shalner 
won the Emmy last 
month for guest star­
ring on "The Practice," 
he joked, 'What took you 
so long?' 
He may not have to 
wait long again for the 
recognition he obviously 
enjoys. 
Shatner's wily ~ or just 
plain nutty ~ Denny 
Crane is no longer a 
drop-in but at the heart of 
"Boston Legal," the new 
David Kelley drama that 
debuted last night. 
The show has been a 
critical sensation , And if 
it's a ratings hit, expect to 
see a lot more articles 
like this one -marvel­
ling at Shatner's ability to 
recreate himself so thor­
oughly, 
Just to tempt the fates, 
he's got a new CD called day 
"Has Been" ~ his first in 
decades -coming out to­
morrow, Yes, things are 
going well ~ something 
Shatner has dealt with 
just as often in his career 
as things going not su 
welL 
"You can't do anything 
else but laugh and roll 
with the punches," says 
Shatner by phone from 
Louisville, where he and 
his wife compete on a 
world class level with 
their American sad­
dlebreds , 
So what's with Denny 
Crane? It he senile or 
smart? 
"The senility may be at 
a balancing point where a 
guy could appear befud­
died and in the next in­
stant be absolutely 
sharp," he says. "I think 
the fun of the character is 
[guessingJ when is he a 
little bit fuzzy and when 
is he not?" No matter what, says 
Shatner, it's nice to be of­
fered a plum role for a 
change, rather than fight­
ing to make projects hap­
pen, like the cable series 
"TekWar" that was 
based on best-selling nov­
els Shatner wrote, 
"Yes, that's great," says 
Shatner, 73, "There is a 
difference between a ge­
nius like David Kelley 
and his support system to 
have scripts of that qual­
ity is so unusual, that I'm 
luxuriating in it. 
"They have fresh flow­
ns on the seL You would 
think a bouquer of flow­
ers would be made of silk 
or whatever. But not on 
'Boston Legal.' They're 
fresh flowers and they get 
changed every three days, 
It's the kind of quality 
that David Kelley wants," 
Shatner is surrounded 
by similar quality on the CD "Has Been" (Shout; 
$18,98), which is pro­
duced by Ben Folds and 
features artists like 
Aimee Mann, Joe Jackson 
(on a blistering cover of­
Pulp's "Common Peo­
ple"); Henry Rollins, 
Lemon Jelly, Adrian 
Belew and Brad Paisley 
(who had a hit video with 
"Celebrity" that featured 
Shatner in a hilarious 
cameo), 
Numerous tracks are 
filled with humor, like 
"You'll Have Time" in 
which Shatner intones, "I 
hate to be the bearer of 
bad news, but you're 
gonn~ die" and goes on to 
name check Johnny Cash, 
JFK, "that guy in the 
Stones," and Joey Ra­
mone, 
But the album isn't 
camp or novelty ~ Shat­
ner has one track dealing 
with the drowning death of his then-wife, Nerine, 
in 1999 that will shut up 
anyone who thinks he's 
just kidding around, 
And of course, there's 
always "Star Trek" It 
seems inevitable Shatner 
will play some sort of 
guest spot on "Enter­
prise" in an attempt to 
boost the franchise's lat­
est TV series. 
Because "Star Trek" al­
ways comes back to Kirk 
and despite the fun Shat­
ner has had with the fame 
~ like that classic" Satur­
day Night Live" skit in 
which he told fans to get 
a life ~ he's never tried 
to disown or walk away 
from the show and its im­
pact. 
"You and I are talking," 
says ShatneL "And I 
never forget that you and 
I are talking in 2004 be­
cause of something I did 
in 1966"</p>
