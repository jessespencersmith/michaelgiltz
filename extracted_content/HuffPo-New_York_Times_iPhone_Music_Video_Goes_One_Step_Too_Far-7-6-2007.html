You'd be hard-pressed to find a media outlet that didn't do a fluffy iPhone-mania story within the
past two weeks. That doesn't mean you have to like it. And when the New York Times  crosses a line
and starts shilling for a product instead of reporting on it, it's dismaying.
David Pogue is a technology reviewer for theNew York Times  who got to play with an
iPhone for days before it came out. Besides thenews articles and blog posts he spun off fromthis opportunity, Pogue also delivered a videoabout his experience.
Essentially comic, " The iPhone Challenge: Keep It Quiet " delivered some real-world critiques of
the phone. But it's overall tone was so goofy and "fun," it should have raised concerns. (The finaleshows Pogue in an office where co-workers realize he has an actual iPhone in his possession andchase after him like a frenzied mob.)
Now Pogue has blurred the line even more and taken the New York Times  with him. His newest
video is " iPhone: The Musical ," a goofy tribute to the phone set to the tune of "My Way." (Not "I'll
Do It My Way" as Pogue, who has worked on Broadway, erroneously refers to it.)It's a silly piece showing Pogue throwing his old cell phone into the water and even getting people
in line at the Apple Store in Manhattan to join in. You could say it has "balance" since Poguementions some of the phone's drawbacks, including a pointed dig at AT&T (lyrics here ).
But essentially it's nothing more than a glorified ad Apple would be delighted to post on theirwebsite. If Pogue were a kid in Oklahoma who put this video on YouTube, I'd say he was clever.But he's not a kid in Oklahoma. He's a reporter for the New York Times .
Not only is the New York Times  devoting time and money (and their reputation) into producing
comic bits, they're doing so in service of promoting a product from another company.

But is the Times  angry? I doubt it. They're desperate -- like all newspapers -- to figure out how to
make money out of their website. Original content like this -- however divorced from their mission
as the paper of record -- is one way to do it. So what if it devalues the Times  as a news outlet and
turns it into a cheerleader for Apple?
The video could air on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart  after all. And who wouldn't want that
sort of cachet? Of course the danger is that Pogue could also be hired away by The Daily Show , but
that's a risk you have to take. Up next week: a New York Times  online sitcom dreamed up by the
sports department. Guess they'll have to close that bureau in Hong Kong to pay for it, but tough
times call for tough choices.
