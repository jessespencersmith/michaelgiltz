THEATER: "Fifty Million Frenchmen" CAN'T Be
Wrong
FIFTY  MILLION  FRENCHMEN:  MUSICALS  IN  MUFTI  ** 1/2
out of ****
YORK  THEATRE  COMPANY  
Cole Porter's breakthrough musical Fifty  Million  Frenchmen  is the
sort of nonsense Broadway audiences won't tolerate anymore. The plotis frivolous (rich Boy makes a bet he can woo the Girl while pretending
to be poor), the characters are cardboard and the songs are only
loosely connected to the story. Sure, once in a blue moon Broadwaywill smile and accept a throwback like Crazy  For  You.  But most of the
time, even when it revives an old fashioned charmer like Oklahoma!,it prefers to dirty them up a bit.
So our only chance to catch a "lost" Broadway landmark like Fifty
Million  Frenchmen  are ventures like Encores! and the York Theatre
Company's Musicals In Mufti series. (Those are musicals done in"street clothes," i.e. casually and quickly so artists can jump in and
audiences can get a sense of the show.) In this case, director Hans
Friedrichs and his game cast had all of seven days to do a read-through, learn their lines, learn the songs, learn some dance movesand learn the staging and then before they've even had time for acoffee break they must get up onstage and perform it in front of a
paying audience.
To be honest, they got a head start on this one. York's Executive
Director Evans Haile (who handles Music Direction, first piano and isa friend) restored Fifty  Million  Frenchmen  in 1991 for the 100th
anniversary celebration of Cole Porter's birth. You can listen on Spotifyto the marvelous all-star recording  he made that year, named by USA
Today as the best theater album of 1991. I agreed.  (You can also buy it
on CD. )

THEATER: "Fifty Million</p>
<p>to head to the York and catch a performance, I'll bet you have the same
reaction to this musical that I do....
Why the heck do we only get to hear silly love songs like this in showsmade 90 years ago and performed on the fly?
Even casual fans will perk up at the Cole Porter standard that starts
things off. "You Do Something To Me" (tackled by leading man Andy
Kelso) is not as flashy or lyrically playful as other Cole Porter gemsand it is not as tuneful as his best. Yet its casual charm (echoed aminute later by the tongue-tied "You've Got That Thing") wins you
over. You're not supposed to start a show with your best song since
late arrivals might miss it. But that's exactly what Porter does here.
Ardent cabaret-goers might recognize the humorous story song "The
Tale Of The Oyster," put over nicely here by Kristy Cates. And yet the
rest of the show is bursting with treats too. As a would-be chanteuse,
Ashley Blanchet steamrolls over the dated bits of the silly "Find Me APrimitive Man" and positively lights up "I'm Unlucky At Gambling."The only shocker here is that she must capture her man, rather thanhaving every man in the show chasing after her. And Karen Murphy
nails the social climbing frustrations of her character Gladys with "The
Queen Of Terra Haute." In a show with little on its mind, Murphyconjures a moment of poignancy and humor almost out of thin air.
Indeed, the women beat out the men from start to finish. Men are all
well and good for paying the bills and wrapping around a finger, but
the women were in charge at the York. They all certainly had goodsongs to work with. In truth, you won't find a weak number here --even the scene-changing filler was sharp, funny and pretty darnwinning. Porter on the rise is a lot more fun than most other
composers at their peak.
Unsurprisingly, the casual nature of the evening calls for
understanding from the audience when it comes to this or thatFrenchmen" CAN'T Be Wrong

<p>moment or a rushed bit of business. No matter. All can be forgiven in
this sort of presentation, where the cast carry the script and score on
stage with them, just in case. And while it's silly to argue over the plotin a show like this, isn't the Boy cheating when he tells the Girl, "Hey,just marry me! I'm super rich!"? Silly me, I thought she'd marry forlove and then  discover her dumb good luck. Perhaps Porter was
already too worldly for that.
Happily,  Fifty  Million  Frenchmen  is the first of three shows in the
next six weeks at the York celebrating Cole Porter. After eleven
performances of this, they tackle the 1965 revue  
The  Decline  and  Fall
Of  The  Entire  World  as  Seen  Through  The  Eyes  Of  Cole  Porter.  And
right after that, they tackle the Ethel Merman vehicle,  Panama  Hattie.
Undoubtedly, it'll be a swell party.
