9/08/2005 02:30:00 PMJohn posted below a link to Dick Cheney getting cursed out bysurvivors of Hurricane Katrina. Yes, it's striking. But do youknow what I saw? Reporters had the vice president on cameraand they failed to ask him even the most basic questions. Infact, they laughed with Cheney over the red-hot anger hiscallous indifference has caused. If any REAL reporters getCheney on camera or in front of a microphone or notepad, hereare some questions to ask:QUESTIONS FOR DICK1. How was your vacation? Did you go fly fishing? What elsedid you do, day-by-day last week?2. Why did you stay on vacation during the worst naturaldisaster in our country's history?3. Why did you stay on vacation over the weekend wheneveryone was warning us that Hurricane Katrina was going tobe an unprecedented natural disaster?4. Why did you stay on vacation on Monday when Katrinadevastated three states and the levees in New Orleans werebreached?5. Why did you stay on vacation on Tuesday when the floodwaters were rising and thousands were dying and hundreds ofthousands were made homeless?6. Why did you stay on vacation on Wednesday when NewOrleans sank into anarchy?7. Why did you stay on vacation on Thursday when evenconservatives were calling Bush's response to this disaster anational disgrace?8. Why did you stay on vacation on Friday and only bother toshow up in DC on Saturday morning for a photo op?9. While you were on vacation, did you check out that lavishmansion in the exclusive, wealthy environs of St. Michael's onChesapeake Bay?10. When did you close on that mansion? Reports say it cost$2.5 million to $3 million. How much did it cost? Don't youthink it shows a cruel disregard during this national tragedy tobe purchasing a lavish estate when hundreds of thousands ofpeople have just watched their homes be destroyed...while youwere on vacation.11. How many bedrooms does this lavish mansion have? Mostof the time you'll be living in DC, right? So how many Americancitizens who had their lives destroyed will you take in and giveshelter in this lavish mansion? Or will you just leave it empty?
