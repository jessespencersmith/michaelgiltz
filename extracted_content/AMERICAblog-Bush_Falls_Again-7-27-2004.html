Bush Falls...Again!
by Michael in New York  on 7/27/2004 10:50:00 PM
George Bush is back on that mountain bike and, yep, he's taken
another tumble. Riding with an AP reporter on Monday, Bush wipedout and went over the handlebars, landing on his back and cutting
his knee. He manfully waved off the medics nearby and continued
biking, though later admitting he felt a little shaken up. Shouldn't the
President of the United States already know how to ride a bike?
