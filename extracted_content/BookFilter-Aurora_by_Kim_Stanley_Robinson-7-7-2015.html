Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayA brilliant stand-alone novel from one of our best writers. Kim Stanley Robinson's first bold gambit in this tale aboutcolonizing the stars is to make the narrator an A.I. Early in the novel, we are on a ship that has been traveling forgenerations towards new worlds where humanity hopes to carve out new homes. In his Mars trilogy, Robinson builtdrama out of the practical and human challenges of terraforming Mars. Typically, here he ponders the hugeobstacles to simply making it intact to a new world light years away. When a key character orders her ship's artificialintelligence to start telling the story of their journey, it's a master stroke. It solves a constant problem in sciencefiction: since the narrator is an A.I., its exposition of technical info can be explained away. We get the hard data andslowly, beautifully, we see the A.I. learn and become a better narrator and eventually -- perhaps -- gain self-awareness. For a while this seems the book's major accomplishment. But then Robinson pushes further and plottwists make this story even more moving and indeed fundamentally about our innate need to survive and explore. It'slike the end of the film "Gravity" but without the faux overheated drama; here the moment is earned. "Aurora"becomes deeply moving, as well as entertaining and compelling and provoking. In short, everything one expects fromKim Stanley Robinson. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayLos Angeles Review of BooksAuroraonAuroraAuroraSPACE.com onApollo 13SciFiNPR BooksAuroraonScientific AmericanAuroraonâ - "Humanity's first trip to another star is incredibly ambitious, impeccably planned and executed on a grand scalein."â- "The of interstellar travel."â - "[A]near-perfect marriage of the technical and the psychological."â - "[A]heart-warming, provocative tale."â - "This ambitious hard SF epic shows Robinson at the top of his game...
