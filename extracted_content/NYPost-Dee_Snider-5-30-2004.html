MUS I C 
Twisted Sister 
lives 
WHICH heavy metal artist shredded a 
live chicken on stage? You'll find out as 
VHl delves into some of the most outra­
geous, shocking, and hilarious antics of 
the genre's notorious artists on Monday's 
"100 Most Metal Moments." 
The cable channel chose the perfect 
narrator for this freak-out show: Dee 
Snider of Twisted Sister. Snider main­
tained his sanity and stayed away from 
chemically altering his perspective -he's 
one of the few people left from that era 
who can actually remember what really 
happened. 
"Being clean and sober and healthy and 
intelligent in the '80s, I was essentially an 
alien," laughs Snider, taking a break from 
recording "House of Hair," his nationally 
syndicated radio show heard on 165 sta­
tions that celebrates metal. 
"I've been married to the same woman 
for 28 years! Now they're all coming 
[over] to my side and cleaning up. I'm thinking of doing smack because I want to 
be an individual," Snider jokes. 
Meatloaf taunting a crowd into throwing 
mountains of refuse; Motley Crue getting 
girls to squat in kitty litter boxes -the 49-
year-old Long Island native saw it all. 
"My favorite was the face-off between 
Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue," Snider 
says of Metal Moment No.7. "They were 
trying to one-up each other and Ozzy end­
ed up snorting a line of red ants. One of the 
Motleys, I can't remember which one, peed 
on the floor and then Ozzy got on all fours 
and licked it up. You can't beat Ozzy." 
Metal moment No.5: "This is Spinal Tap." 
Snider's own key metal moment may 
have come when he testified in front of 
Congress and proved himself a passionate 
and intelligent defender of free speech. 
Now he breeds dogs and rereads the sweet­
ly nostalgic work ofJean Shepherd. Snider's 
also working on a sequel to his cult film, 
"Strangeland" (the most stolen video in 
America, he claims), and doing occasional 
gigs with Twisted Sister, clad in full mid­
'80s regalia. 
"The bad news is we look like a bunch of 
aging drag queens," Snider says. "The good 
news is we always looked like a bunch of 
aging drag queens." -Michael Giltz
