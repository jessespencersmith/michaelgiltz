<p>NON-FICTION  
Can You Dig It?
‘Underground: A Human History Of The Worlds Beneath Our Feet’
 February 5, 2019  Michael Giltz
When author Will Hunt was a kid, a teacher told his class about an abandoned tunnel beneath the surface of
their small town. Naturally, Hunt and some friends tracked down the entrance and whooped their way throughan awesome sight: a huge tunnel, practically an invisible empire lying underfoot. Perhaps unnaturally, Huntbecame obsessed with that tunnel, exploring it again and again and then realizing with a jolt it ran right belowthe very house he lived in.
That was that, until Hunt moved to New York City.  On the streets of Manhattan, Hunt was lost. He found the
subway confusing but was bewildered and overwhelmed, too embarrassed to ever ask for directions.  Yet he
realized that an underground city, a maze of tunnels and pathways that were semi-abandoned and sort of illegal,
lay just beneath,  there for theexploring. He ventured timidly intoone such tunnel. He just slippedthrough a fence near the West SideHighway, and suddenly he was belowthe surface of the city! And then heventured, not so timidly, into subwaytunnels.
Before he knew it, Hunt’s childhood
passion became a lifelong obsession.Part travelogue and part meditation onthe nature of our connection to caves,Underground  provides a fascinating,
intriguing look at the bizarre,dangerous and thrilling subterraneanadventures Hunt has taken part in allover the world. He’s been lost in thecatacombs underneath Paris and goneon a songline in Australia to win favorwith aboriginal tribes guarding afabled buried location. He’s partneredwith scientists and local experts toplumb Mayan ruins. Hunt wooed an</p>
<p>aristocratic French family whose
estate sits on an undisturbedunderground system. Deep inside, inthe most inaccessible spot, he finds a
sculpture of bison that leaves him and other visitors weeping.
On and on it goes, with Hunt traipsing all over the globe and showing how virtually every culture has a deep
and powerful connection to the earth. From obsessive diggers in England to a subway graffiti artist who placeshis visual diaries in locations where literally no one can safely glimpse them, Hunt makes fascinatingconnections again and again.  Ultimately, it seems perfectly natural for him to squeeze between girders assubway trains rumble past or spend a day huddled in absolute darkness in a cave where jaguars may or may notshow up at any minute. It’s fun, a little frightening and awfully intriguing. Hunt might just make you peer downthe nearest manhole and wonder what would happen if you pulled it open and slipped down inside…just for aglimpse.
