10/13/2004 02:31:00 AMBut the fight over it will be. Here's a very good article in theWashington Post about black leaders in Florida fighting to make surethe votes of their community will be counted. And anyone who tellsyou the election wasn't stolen can read just this one little tidbit:"Four years ago, ballots cast from black neighborhoods throughoutFlorida were four times as likely to go uncounted as those from whiteneighborhoods. Nowhere was the disparity more apparent than inDuval County, where 42 percent of 27,000 ballots thrown out camefrom four heavily Democratic black precincts."That's more than 10,000 votes tossed away and since black voterswent for Gore at more than 90%, that's about 9,000 votes for Gore ina state that went for Bush by 537 votes.
