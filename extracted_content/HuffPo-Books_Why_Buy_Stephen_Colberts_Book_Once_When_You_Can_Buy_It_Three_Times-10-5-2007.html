The publishing industry is suffering and an article in the New York Times  on TV comic Stephen
Colbert's  new book explains why. The story focused on the audio version of his book I Am America
(And So Can You!),  which is already on sale at iTunes and Audible.com  even before the hardcover
hits bookstores on Tuesday, October 9.
One of the suits says the audio book is so creative and different that, "I would think that you would
buy the book and the audio because they are really different." In other words, he expects fans ofColbert to buy the hardcover book for $27, then buy the audio book for about $16 and while you'reat it, when a downloadable version becomes available for your Sony Reader or computer orBlackberry, maybe you'd be willing to pay another $25 or so for that version. He's not alone. Evenwhen the audio book isn't somewhat different from the hardcover, they expect fans of a book tobuy it twice.
Imagine if the music industry demanded you buy onecopy of your album for playing on your home stereo,another for your car, another for your iPod and so on.You wouldn't do it, would you? But the book industry- which publishes more than 100,000 titles a year -thinks it's perfectly reasonable to expect you to do it
for books. Except you're not even buying books in hardcover: specialty and independent bookstoresare disappearing and sales are flat or down in most categories.
Every industry wants to mimic the success of the DVD, one of the most successful products in
history. Books add in reader's guides and author interviews and think that is akin to the DVDextras. Some even include public domain DVDs with movie versions of classic novels like JaneEyre and A Tale Of Two Cities  and the like, as if people who read books really would rather be
watching movies.
But the lessons of the DVD are simple. It offered far superior picture and sound to VHS, contained

Watch...extras unavailable or impractical on tape (like commentary tracks) and it did it at a MUCH lower
price.
But the book industry doesn't think prices are too high - it thinks prices aren't high enough. How
else to explain why the book industry is turning its back on inexpensive mass market paperbacks,just like the music industry turned its back on the single until iTunes proved sales of singles couldbe a billion dollar industry.
But publishers are besotted with "trade paperbacks," the slightly larger version of mass market
paperbacks (the "airport" books that are light and easy to carry and still around when it comes tonames like Stephen King and genres like romance). Publishers tricked authors into thinking tradepaperbacks are more "prestigious" than mass market books and now many books aren't publishedin mass market at all, while others don't come out for years. Trade paperbacks can easily cost $15or more, even for books that are 20, 30, or 50 years old or more. Publishers insist people don't likemass market paperbacks and really want to spend twice as much on a trade paperback. Obviously,
it's been a long time since they actually had to pay for a book.
And to top it off, when the book industry has new extras they can add to the value of a book like
audio and downloadable versions, they want to charge you almost as much for that as the book
itself. How excited would people be about commentary tracks or deleted scenes from Transformersif they had to pay $20 extra to get them after buying the DVD?
So here's what the book industry needs to do. Bring back the mass market paperback for all titles
and keep the price low, say $7. Package them as attractively as you do the trade paperbacks andhardcover editions.
Now here's the tricky part. Audio books are a valid niche market, that brings in money.
Downloadable books could be a revenue stream in the future. Tough. You need to make the bookmore attractive and that means offering more extras for the same (or lower) price. Everyone whobuys a hardcover book should get free access to the audio version and the downloadable text.Imagine buying a book and being able to get the audio edition for listening in your car or iPod andan easily portable downloadable version for your Blackberry or laptop or electronic reader.Happily, with the Internet, making these available will cost very little. Once you've made a copy,it's easy to share with the world.
Suddenly, people might see the $25 or more they pay for a hardcover book as a decent value. With
a lot more ways to catch up on the book they bought, people would be encouraged to read morebooks and more often. Finding cheap, attractive paperbacks always available would continue thattrend. Stephen Colbert's fans will be laughing at his jokes on the subway, in the car, on a plane, atwork on their lunch hour and at home - and without having to spend $65 for the pleasure ofbuying the same book again and again and again.
So have you ever bought a book in two different formats (ie hardcover and audio)? Would you be
more likely to buy a book if it came with the extras of audio and downloadable text? Would you
rather buy a trade paperback for $16 instead of a mass market paperback for $7? And have youever been surprised by the price of a book and decided not to buy it?

When I read Lewis Black's book last year I could NOT read a single word without his voice in my head.
It was great!Reading stimulates the imagination far more than audio or visual input.One of the reasons that reading makes you smarter is because you use parts of your brain which arebecoming NUMB in our current society. You imagine the scenery and characters visually and audiblyand that is something that cannot and should not be replaced
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I agree nothing replaces reading a good book. But the more you read, the more you want toread and if some people want to listen to a book while commuting -- when they couldn't readanyway -- what's the harm? And a well-read book is a fine entertainment in and of itself --such as Jim Dale's marvelous work on Harry Potter. How else can a family sit together and
enjoy a book all at the same time? None of this would displace reading itself and I'm certain it
would lead to more reading. IN any case, whatever your preference -- be it an eBook or an
audio file or a hard copy -- booksellers should recharge their industry by making all of them
available for one low price.

With the media spotlight on Hollywood and the music industry, I hadn't even thought about taking acloser look at the publishing industry's distribution efforts in the online age. 
Like the RIAA and Hollywood, I expect major publishers are more fearful of online distribution than
anything else, but they have an ace in the hole -- reading a physical book is an experience that can'teasily be duplicated online (yet). However, I think if they were to follow your advice, and offer"packages" of hardcover, PDF, and audio versions, it might help spur additional sales. (Provided theydon't get stupid greedy -- since the PDF and audiobook don't add physical costs, keep the hardcover
price the same.)
With iPods and other mp3 music players becoming ubiquitous, the publishing industry has been slow to

push the marketing of audiobooks -- it's easier than ever for people to "read" while commuting to work,
flying on vacation, eating lunch, or even relaxing by the pool. With huge amounts of storage space,your favorite books are only a click away, along with a few new books or bestsellers on your to-do list. 
Your suggestion of bundling different formats together is a perfect way to get more people to
experiment with audiobooks -- and I think a good number of them will become hooked (as I have). 
Michael, thanks for a thought-provoking article with interesting analysis. FWIW, I plan to buy the audiobook version of Colbert's book from the iTunes Store before a long flight
to Europe next week.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Thanks for reading. The iPod explosion and easy availability of downloadable text files andMP3s (for very little cost) means booksellers should absolutely NOT raise prices. Add valueto books, don't try and squeeze out more money from a diminishing audience. The Colbertaudiobook is a good buy -- too bad you won't have the hardback version waiting at home
when you get back. Have a safe flight.

Libraries are great and a wonderful resource for anyone who doesn't feel the need to build
their own personal library or is short on cash. But in a consumer crazed society, I think gettingpeople to be avid readers (whether via the library or bookstores) is a lot better use of theirmoney and time than $200 sneakers, designer clothes, the latest digital camera or doohickey,the fifth sequel to a bad movie or just about anything else you can name.

If I buy Stephen Colbert's new book it will be the audio version. If he records it himself it will be in'character' and that adds depth to the reading, much like Tyler Perry's 'Madea'. Other books I eitherbuy hard copies or PDF's...
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
You've got a good point. Colbert did record it himself, along with Amy Sedaris, Jon Stewartand other contributors, so I'm sure it will have more appeal than most audio books to thecasual reader. But why should you have to choose? Or more importantly, why should thebook industry force you to choose? Wouldn't you rather get a hardcover copy AND access tothe audio version AND access to a PDF? Wouldn't that make the $20 or so you're going topay seem like a much better deal? It worked with DVDs.

As someone who has perhaps bought more audio books than most because myMIL has macular degeneration, how good the audio book is (after, of course, howwell the book is written) has everything to do with how good the reader is. Welistened to one book whose author read it so badly, we never talk about the book,only how horrible she read it. On the other hand, some books I bought for my MIL

Comments are closed for this entry(who now thankfully can borrow them by mail for free) I bought because I knew the
book was good and the reader/actor made them even better. Those books were a
joy to listen to and had I first bought the CD, I never would have bought the book.Although audio books are normally way overpriced, I do understand the necessary
value added by getting a good actor to read it. A bad reader can completely ruin the
book. I would pay more for a package of book and audio combined - but not
significantly more. If it were not for my MIL, I would not have gotten many of the
books I did in audio, the surprise was how much better some of these books were inthe audio version than when I read them myself. The industry should really try morefor this audience if book sales are in that much decline.

"Imagine if the music industry demanded you buy one copy of your album for playing on your homestereo, another for your car, another for your iPod and so on. You wouldn't do it, would you?"
They don't? Remember, the RIAA tried to ban audio cassettes, some labels tried to install "anti-piracy"
rootkits that would ostensibly prevent copying CDs, and in actuality rendered people's computers opento intrusion, and are actively suing and harassing people who may or may not have downloaded orshared MP3 tracks.

Yep I was one of the people with the terrific Neil Diamond album I couldn't legally rip and playon my iPod because of their software. And like the movie industry -- which was frightened ofthe VCR and the DVD and downloads -- the music industry and every other industry tends tobe frightened of new technology until they are forced to realize it's good for business. But fornow, most CDs can in fact be played on any system at home or in your car or boat or laptopand ripped and put onto a media device like an iPod or take individual tracks and make a mix
tape and so on. But as for people who steal music they haven't bought via illegal sharing
online, the record companies can and should knuckle down. But the best way is not lawsuits
but easy, dependable, inexpensive online services like iTunes that give people what they
want.

This is one arena where Baen Books is doing itself and readers a favor. Now, they're releasingelectronic versions of their library for free both online and in CD form inserted in different books theyprint instead of audio books, but they're still providing customers a choice. And darned if people aren'tmore willing to buy the hard copy once they've read the PDF. I know I've been happier buying theirmaterial new based on that little perk alone.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
That's the sort of innovation a tiny company like Baen must do. Unfortunately, a major houseisn't smart enough to catch on that audio and downloadable versions should be bonuses forbuying a book instead of a revenue stream that forces fans of an author to either have tochoose (do I want a physical copy of the new John Grisham or an audio version to listen toon my trip) or in rare circumstances pay for both.
