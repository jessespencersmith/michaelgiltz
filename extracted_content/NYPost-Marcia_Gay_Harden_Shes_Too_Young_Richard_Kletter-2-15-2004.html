• REALLY BIG SHOW 
14 going on sex-tee. 
By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
THE sexually charged lives of Ameri­
can teenagers comes under scrutiny 
in "She's Too Young," a Lifetime 
TV-movie that comes complete with a set 
of statistics that will very likely scare the 
living daylights out of any parent. 
One in five kids has sex before they're 
15. One in seven 14-year-old girls has been 
pregnant and 50 percent of 14-year-olds 
have gone to parties where there was no 
adult supervision. But perhaps the most 
alarming part of this movie about Hannah 
Vogel, a 14-year-old suburban high-school 
student who contracts syphilis, is that 
she's a smart kid with good self-esteem 
whose mother does everything you'd ex­
pect of a good parent. 
In "She's Too Young," Hannah (Alexis 
Dziena), who plays the cello and gets 
good grades, finds herself attending par­
ties where kids drink, do drugs, and have 
group sex. Hannah's mom, Trish (Marcia 
Gay Harden) doesn't know anything 
about this underground culture until a 
syphilis outbreak at Hannah's school 
gives parents -and educators -a 
much-needed reality-check. 
The world depicted in the film would 
seem too sensational if it wasn't so real, 
says screenwriter Richard Kletter, a di­
vorced father of two teens who also 
wrote the 2001 Lifetime movie, "After 
Amy" with Bridget Fonda. 
"The idea [for the film] came to me be­
cause of an incident at a private school 
my daughter was attending," he explains. 
"On the front page of the school newspa­
per was a story about eighth-grade girls 
[performing oral sex] behind the gym. 
There was a parent meeting and the fa­
thers of girls nearly got into fistfights 
with the fathers of boys. Ever since, I'd 
been wanting to do something on that 
subject. Lifetime sat on the script till 
'Thirteen' came out. That emboldened 
them." 
But unlike that film, in which Holly 
Hunter plays the dysfunctional mom of a 
sexually promiscuous thireen-year-old 
girl, the morn played by Harden is nearly 
ideal. She always gets phone numbers in 
case of emergencies and calls the parents 
of other children Hannah is spending 
time with. 
In other words, you can be an ideal par­
ent "and it still happens," says Harden, a 
Best Supporting Actress Oscar-winner 
and nominee this year for "Mystic River." 
Besides, says Harden, who is expecting 
her second child, "there's no such thing 
as an ideal parent. And I believe even 
with parents who are checking up, their 
kids are going to do this anyway." 
Still, Harden felt her character needed 
some fine-tuning. "Initially, they [made 1 
my character a workaholic. That's fine, I 
said. But let's not give each parent a fault 
and a strike against them." 
Kletter agreed. He didn't want to give 
adult viewers the chance to say, "We're 
not like that; that couldn't happen to us." 
"Sexual promiscuity is pretty easy to 
dismiss if somebody is stoned or making 
incredibly bad choices about boyfriends 
or is a religious zealot and reacting to ex­
treme restrictions," he says. 
As Hannah, Dziena says that the sexual 
behavior in "She's Too Young" was unfa-miliar to her; growing up in New York, 
she didn't see the same pressures on 
teens that were depicted in the movie. 
"I feel like things like this happen more 
[often] in the suburbs," she says. "In the 
city, there's a lot more to explore that 
doesn't involve sex." But the actress adds 
that working with a seasoned pro like 
Harden made it easier for her to recap­
ture the feeling of being fourteen again. 
Klclter hopes that young people will 
watch this movie with their parents -
even if, in showing what some thirteen­
and fourteen-year-old children are up to, 
he's made a film that some parents might 
feel is actually inappropriate for kids that 
age to watch. "If this had been a feature, we would 
have gone much further," Kletter says. 
"The real stories are much worse. I think 
there's a responsibility in making an is­
sue-oriented movie. We wanted to make 
something that would not turn off the 
kids so they would watch it with their 
parents." 
That's might be wishful thinking, evcn 
for kids like Dziena who are over 18 and 
more mature. "My parents haven't seen 
the movie yet," she says with a laugh. 
''I'm sure there will be at least one mo­
ment of [them saying], 'Oh God, I hope 
that wasn't what she was doing at 14.'"
