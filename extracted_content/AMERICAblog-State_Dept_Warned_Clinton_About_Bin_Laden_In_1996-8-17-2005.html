8/17/2005 06:00:00 PMThe second story in as many weeks suggesting it's all Clinton'sfault for not killing Bin Laden. Here's the analysis Clintonreceived:"...[Bin Laden's] prolonged stay in Afghanistan - wherehundreds of 'Arab mujahedeen' receive terrorist trainingand key extremist leaders often congregate - could provemore dangerous to U.S. interests in the long run than histhree-year liaison with Khartoum," in Sudan.Good, solid analysis. But when it comes to smoking guns, thatdoesn't even begin to compare to:BIN LADEN DETERMINED TO ATTACK INSIDE THE UNITEDSTATESOr we could blame Reagan for training and arming Bin Laden in thefirst place. But keep trying, far right. Maybe we'll all forget the worstterrorist attack in US history happened on Bush's watch and heresponded by failing to catch Bin Laden and then invading a countrythat had nothing to do with it. Then again, maybe we won't forget.
