Thisis the best news I've heard in ages. George Lucas has bowed to populardemand and will release the original "Star Wars" trilogy on DVD intheir original theatrical version. God knows why Lucas changed hismind -- he insisted he would never, ever do it despite the tremendousdemand. In fact, the vitriolic fury that greeted his rewriting of historyseemed to make Lucas hunker down even more. He seemed offendedpeople would even ask, much less expect to have the original theatricalversions that broke box office records. But anyway, Lucasfilm stillmanaged to be snarky, saying "See the title crawl to 'Star Wars' beforeit was known as Episode IV; see the pioneering, if dated, motion-control model work on the attack on the Death Star; groove to LaptiNek or the Ewok Celebration song like you did when you were a kid;and, yes, see Hans Solo shoot first." Whatever. At least we'll have themovies in September. Lucas can release a ten hour version of the first"Star Wars" movie for all I care. (Heck, I'll line up to see it.) But theoriginal theatrical version should ALWAYS be available.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
