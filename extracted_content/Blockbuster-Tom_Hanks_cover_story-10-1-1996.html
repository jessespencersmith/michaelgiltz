            <p>Tom Hanks in his 
most difficult role 
yet: director. 
Below: A scene

You Do! Hanks 
plays the manager

o what does a 
superstar do for an encore 
after he's won two back-to-back Oscars, received every acco­
lade, and is among the most sought-after leading men in 
Hollywood-all by age 40? 
If you're Tom Hanks, you ·climb "onto the back of a 
flatbed train that's going 60 miles an hour." Figuratively, not 
literally. That's how the celebrated actor describes directing 
his first feature film, That Thing You Dol, at the breakneck 
sprint of "full-tilt boogie." The movie, a dramatic comedy set 
in 1964, is about an Erie, Pennsyl~ania, rock band called The Videography

Wonders. Their signature song soars on the charts and sends 
its four young musician s on a personal and professional jour­
ney from spaghetti joints to stardom. 
"You're hurtling from one station to the next because of 
all the things that have to be done," says Hanks. "We opened 
production offices in July '95, and I've been working full­
time-24 hours a day, seven days a week-ever since." 
Not that he's complaining. After his string of successful 
rums-A League of Their Own, Sleepless in Seattie, Philadelphia. 
Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Toy Story-Hank s could have 
chosen to sit quietly at home reading scripts, readying for 
another role, or reliving his Academy Award moments . But 
which script? Which role? Just how do you top success? 
"There was the requisite amount of depression after 
Apollo 13," Hanks admits. "Creatively, I needed something 
new." It was Philadelphia director Jonathan Demme who put 
the idea of directing in Hanks's head. "I was with Jonathan in 
New York, and we were talking about my doing this role or 
that, and he said, 'You know, the coolest thing you could do

<p>" r HANKS 
continued from page 17 
now is say, Forget it; I want to direct.' 
And I said, 'You're right.''' 
So Hanks joined a growing list of 
celebrated actors fortunate enough to 
peak before their first gray hair, like Mel 
Gibson, Kevin Costner, Robert Redford, 
Clint Eastwood, and Warren Beatty, 
who all turned to directing not just for a 
new challenge but also for the thrill of 
that heart-racing, fear-provoking "first­
time" feeling. "I ended up directing this 
thing because it was the most bodacious 
thing to do," Hanks explains. "There 
wasn't a single moment on the movie 
that my experiences as an actor prepared 
me for. Not the first read-through, not 
the first day of shooting, not any big 
scene. You don't have time to celebrate 
any sort of achievement because the 
clock is running. You do not get so much 
as a nanosecond to say, 'okay, let me sit 
back and enjoy the vista.'" 
Though he's legendary for his 
laid-back manner on-and offscreen, 
Hanks kept a more frenetic pace for 
this film. Not only did he direct, he 
also conceived the story, penned the 
screenplay, and cowrote some of the 
original songs on the soundtrack. 
Given the movie's subject matter, it 
would be natural to assume that Hanks, 
like many baby boomers, once had a 
garage band. But he's not a trained 
musician (though he did take up the 
guitar on the set of Turner & Hooch on 
the advice of costar Mare Winningham 
so he'd "always have something to do" 
in his trailer). In fact, he'd always 
regarded rock stars with awe. 
What fascinated Hanks even more 
were movies about guys in bands, most 
notably Richard Lester's two Beatles 
classics, Help! and A Hard Day's Night, 
and John Boorman' s Having a Wild 
Weekend, with the Dave Clark Five. 
Two of his other favorites were the 
Talking Heads concert film Stop 
Making Sense, directed by Demme, and 
the comedy about Beatles fans, I 
Wanna Hold Your Hand, by Robert 
Zemeckis, Hanks's director on Forrest 
Gump. But it wasn't until he saw Alan 
Parker's The Commitments, chronicling 
the make-or-break struggles of a young Irish band, that Hanks thought about 
an American version. 
Initially, he was worried that doing 
a '60s period musical came loaded with 
perils. In his view, too many were "just a 
bad version of Elvis Presley movies." He 
decided to first try his hand at a screen­
play and "write something that was rel­
atively familiar, yet had all sorts of new 
stuff in it." In 1994, he fleshed out an 
idea that had been "percolating for some 
time" into a nine-page outline. "Work­
ing on the screenplay was a test to see if 
I had the concentration, and the stom­
ach, to start on page one and continue 
on to page 121," Hanks recalls. 
"I was waiting for it to fall apart. 
On page seven? Page 27? Page 67? It 
took three months to do a cohesive 
draft that sort of worked." 
Hanks also wasn't sure if he want­
ed to direct-or if he could. "For years, 
I wouldn't have considered myself qual­
ified. I didn't have the social skills, the 
business acumen, or the ability to com­
municate that is necessary," he says. 
Nor, until recently, the Hollywood 
clout. 
Back in 1990, Hanks's career, 
which had sparked with the 1984 
sleeper Splash, almost went up in 
smoke because of The Bonfire of the 
Vanities. That movie was ripped apart 
by critics and audiences; a book was 
even written about its many missteps. 
After that debacle, Hanks fired his 
handlers and hired the town's most 
powerful talent agency, CAA, to rescue 
him from the brink. From the moment 
Forrest Gump passed the $300 million 
mark at the box office in 1995, Hanks 
had carte blanche. When he brought 
his screenplay to 20th Century Fox, 
where he had a first-look deal, execu­
tives gave him the green light to direct. 
"A guy like me directing his first 
movie is going to garner attention," 
Hanks admits. "So the question was, 
Are we going to do this right? Or are 
we going to do this in a cheap, incred­
ibly abbreviated way? That was the stu­
dio's call." But to create the right look 
(he once had driven through Erie and 
• thought it was a cool town) and feel 
(the summer of '64 was "modern 
enough, goofy enough, and yet 
removed enough, and the music is still pretty good") of the place, the actor 
asked for $25 million. 
Two Oscars helped him get it. 
Hanks cast four unknowns as the 
male leads-Tom Everett Scott, Jon­
athon Schaech, Steve Zahn, and Ethan 
Embry-and Liv Tyler as the female 
lead without knowing she would steal 
the thunder from the other cast mem­
bers of Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing 
Beauty ("Hey, I just thought I was cast­
ing that girl in the Aerosmith video"). 
He also offered parts to Rita Wilson, his 
wife, and Peter Scolari, his co-star on 
the 1980-1982 TV series Bosom Buddies, 
which had catapulted Hanks from a col­
lege drama major and New York stage 
actor to network comedy star. 
Finally, Hanks cast himself as Mr. 
White, a cynical-about- show-business 
record executive for Play tone Records 
who signs The Wonders to his label. 
"The role doesn't require a huge 
amount of emoting-it's not like his 
dog dies or something. But it was nice 
to impact scenes," Hanks says. "There 
were times when I was directing and I'd 
think, 'Man, it'd be fun to be an actor in 
this movie.' \Vhen I got to be an actor, 
it was fun." 
As for the directing experience, 
Hanks calls it "constant crisis manage­
ment." Aware that he was working with 
young, inexperienced actors, Hanks tried 
to create a "no pressure, open set" where 
they wouldn't be afraid to experiment. 
"The thing I always tried to say is that 
you cannot do wrong. The worst thing 
that will happen is we won't use the take. 
No one's going to get punished." He 
credits those who've directed him­
Demme, Zemeckis, Ron Howard, Nora 
Ephron, Penny Marshall, some of the 
best in the business-with teaching him 
that "there's no one way to do anything." 
The only thing Hanks did insist on 
is that his actors were prepared. He 
made his cast watch a lot of Shindig and 
Hullabalo o, TV programs from the early 
'60s, to pick up the way people talked 
and carried themselves during that 
period. For the music scenes, Hanks 
says, "We were going for that energy 
and excitement, but also simplicity. 
You're watching these guys perform 
and that's the hallmark."

Hanks's song-writing ability will 
be hard to judge since what he wrote 
for the film was supposed to be "cheesy." 
For the "good" songs, I-Ianks wanted 
original music, and he and producer 
Gary Getzman sifted through about 
400 submissions before selecting two 
Nashville tunesmith s to write the bulk 
of the numbers. 
Only after the movie was edited to 
a 2'l:-hour rough cut did Hanks feel 
bold enough to invite his close friends 
to see it. And the first time he showed 
it to an audience, in Phoenix, it was "a 
bona fide surprise. I was anticipating, 
'Oh my god, it's a screening. I'll have to 
throw up in the car on the way to the 
theater.' But I couldn't wait to see what 
they were going to tell me!" 
\Vanting an "llO~est reaction" to his 
film, he sneaked into the theater once 
the lights went down. "It's a problem 
when you're a celebrity. If nobody 
knows who you are, you can sit back and 
it's no big dcal. But if the crowd knows 
you're there, which most of them prob­
ably did, it's going to affect the process." 
~atu rally, Hollywood is holding 
its breath, waiting to sec how the film is 
recei\·ed. Hanks's ncxt possible project 
may be as an actor-in the World War 
II drama Saving Private Ryall, a joint 
effort by Paramount/Dreamworks 
SKG. which hc might make with direc­
tor Stcven Spielberg. Asked whether 
he'd consider directing again, Hanks 
responds, "I f the opportunity comes, I'll 
look forward to it because I'll know 
better what to worry about and what 
not to. I'll know where I can truly man­
age and where I'd be wasting my time 
trying to micromanage . I'd know how 
to shoot things better, too. 
"But in all honesty, it would be 
hard to have any enthusiasm to direct 
again if this movie tanks because .1 like 
the way it came out. If I'm so totally 
wrong, well, theil, you know what? I 
had a pretty good movie star gig going, 
and I ought to stick with that." 0
