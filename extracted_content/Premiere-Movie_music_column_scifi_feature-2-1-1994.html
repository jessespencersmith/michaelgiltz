            <p>SCORING PlanetoftheApes (Intrada). An early 
landmark for Jerry Goldsmith. This jagged, 
inventive music is, naturally, reminiscent 
of his style on TV's The Twilight Zone and 
contains a justly famous cue-"The 
Hunt" -that incorporates a ram's horn. Sci-fi Highs 
Alien trilogy. Few series have given 
birth to such diverse and satisfying movie music. Alien 
(Silva Screen), by Goldsmith, is genuinely unnerving; 
Aliens (Varese), by James Horner, is foreboding when­
ever it isn't plunging headlong into the fray; and Alien3 
(MCA) combines a clever but creepy musical signature 
for the nasty creatures with a contemplative, religious 
tone that befits the movie's thematic concerns . o GENRE frees the composer 's imagination as 
readily as science fiction. Grand statements 
abound-a modest sci-fi score is about as com­
mon as a low-key opera. Here are a few classic 
examples, offering everything from Wagnerian 
might to cheeky sambas. 
Alex North's "2001" (Varese Sarabande ). Possibly the 
greatest score not in a movie. It 
was reportedly commissioned by 
Stanley Kubrick to appease the 
studio, even though he never in­
tended to use it. Now, some 2S 
years later, we can finally hear 
North's work. From the dramatic 
organ flourish in "Main Title" to 
the charming waltz of "Space 
Station Docking" (where 
Kubrick used "The Blue Dan­
ube"), it was well worth the wait. 
"Star Wars" Trilogy (Twentieth 
Century Fox Film Scores). An 
exceptionally impressive four­
CD set that does right by the 
John Williams triptych: one CD 
for each film, a fourth for miscel-Law and orchestra: Be careful, folks-Big Brother is listening. 
laneous cues, and a lavishly illustrated booklet with 
track-by-track commentary . Pair it with the equally ex­
pansive FoxVideo laserdisc boxed set and you could 
spend weeks reading, watching , and listening to George 
Lucas's masterwork-and months despairing that he 
won't continue the saga. Back on Earth: John Corigliano 's Altered States (RCA 
Victor), an alternately frenetic and lyric piece; Basil Pole­
douris's melodramatic RoboCofJ (Varese); and Michael 
Kamen's witty Brazil (Milan), featuring well-chosen bits 
of dialogue, Kate Bush, and enough versions of "Brazil" 
to drive anyone slightly daft. MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
