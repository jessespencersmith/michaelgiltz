8/08/2005 11:31:00 PMAn excellent London Review of Books article on Iraq fromreporter Patrick Cockburn. Only available to subscribers, sohere are some substantial highlights. In short: things arelooking down.Suicide bombs blow up with the regularity of an artillerybarrage in Baghdad. I no longer always go up onto the roofof the al-Hamra Hotel, where I am living, to see the blacksmoke rising and to try to work out where the bomb wentoff. On a single day recently 12 suicide bombsexploded in the city, killing at least 30 people....Gloom is deeper in Baghdad now than at any time since theoverthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Even Iraqiofficials in the relative safety of the Green Zone, onceinvariably optimistic, are beginning to despair. It isnot only the increase in the number of suicide bombs.There is a water shortage in some parts of the city.Electricity supply is down to five hours a day....Hatred between Sunni and Shia Arabs has been intensifyingover the past few months. Iraqis used to claim thatsectarianism had been fomented or exacerbated bySaddam. In reality the tension between Sunni, Shia andKurd has always shaped Iraqi politics....Defence procurement in the Middle East, as in much of theworld, is corrupt. But in most countries usable equipment,however overpriced, does eventually turn up. In Iraq thecorruption is on a different scale: often the moneydisappears entirely and nothing is received in return....Nobody knows how many soldiers and policemen actuallyturn up for work. Mahmoud Othman, a veteran Kurdishpolitical leader, says that an army unit supposedlynumbering 2200 men was sent to Kirkuk. The Kurdscounted them: there were just 300 men in the unit. Nobodyknew what had happened to the other 1900. "They saythat there are 150,000 men in the army and police,"Othman says, "but I believe the real figure is40,000." The rest either appear only to draw theirpay or never existed in the first place....The chances of a unitary Iraq emerging from the conflictare dwindling. The Kurds, triumphant after fighting for halfa century, are not going to give up the oil city of Kirkuk orabandon a level of autonomy close to independence. TheShias want as much power as they can get. The Sunnishave shown by their armed resistance that they candestabilise Iraq for as long as they want. But the insurgentswill not be able to spread resistance beyond the Sunnicommunity because of the savage attacks by the suicidebombers on Shia mosques and children playing in the streetin Shia districts. The appeal of Iraqi nationalism isebbing....And my favorite line:The looting of Baghdad which began in the days afterSaddam's fall has never really ended.
