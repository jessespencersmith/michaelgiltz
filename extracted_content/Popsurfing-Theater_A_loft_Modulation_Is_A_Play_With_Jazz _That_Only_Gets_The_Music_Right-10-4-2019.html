THEATER: "A(loft) Modulation" -- A Play With
Jazz Only Gets The Music Right
(A)LOFT  MODULATION  * 1/2 out of ****
THE  A.R.T./  NEW  YORK  THEATRES
When you hear about it, you can't help heading to Sixth Avenue
between 28th and 29th Street in NYC. In the mid-1950s, acclaimedphotographer W. Eugene Smith left a sweet gig at Life  magazine,
moved into a loft at that address and got to work. One neighbor was a
teacher at Julliard whose own loft became a de facto jam session and
rehearsal space for a rotating cast of jazz musicians including the great(Thelonius Monk, Charles Mingus, Bill Evans) and the never-was(drummer Ronnie Free). Painters like Salvador Dali also swung by.
And Smith documented it all. He relentlessly took photographs from
1957-1965. Of course he captured the jazz greats. But Smith alsopeeked out his window, meticulously (obsessively?) taking photos ofthe street life below. As if that weren't enough, he wired the wholedamn building for sound, recording everything from the jazz musicians
to snatches of conversation to late-night bull sessions about the nature
of art. The result? Some 40,000 images and more than 4,500 hours ofaudio tape.
When writer Sam Stephenson stumbled on this mother-load, he
became just as obsessed as Smith, spending years archiving and
organizing all this material. The result? A book, a documentary film, aradio series on NPR (what the kids today would think of as a"podcast") and a traveling exhibition.
And now, unfortunately, a play. Jaymes Jorsling saw this ferment of
artistic creation and thwarted dreams, this cross-pollination of jazzand photography and art (and literature -- Norman Mailer dropped in,too) and wanted to capture it onstage.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On
Shaky Ground</p>
<p>(Photo by Joan Marcus ©2019)
It's all there in that photo, which accurately captures the jumble of a
set and play that is the fictionalized drama with music (A)loftModulation. The photographer -- heavy-handedly called Myth
Williams -- is often stage right, looking at the world outside through a
camera lens. Stage left is Steve Samuels, a guy stuck in 2019,unemployed and adrift, hectored by his sensible wife but inexplicablyset afire by the "junk" he's discovered in this tumble-down loft. Stevesits there listening to reel after reel of captured conversations and
musical performances. A jazz band swings away in the loft positioned
above and behind him while junkies and hookers wander around.Endless talk of Art and Life take place, none of it revealing.
The modest storylines (the modern tale of a guy finding purpose in life
for the first time, a drummer fighting heroin addiction, a prostitutetentatively enjoying the idea her view of the world might have value)never hold your interest. And yet, you can't help wishing the playwould choose one of them and stick to it. Certainly, the sight of a man
listening to old audiotapes is inherently undramatic, no matter how
often his wife stops to ask exactly what the hell he's doing and why didhe quit his job. But while none of the stories are worth hearing moreabout, it's certainly preferable to the wide-angle approach taken in
(A)loft where everything simply happens all at once.
It's a credit to the rich vein of voyeurism and artistry of The Loft
Project that it's proven a source for worthwhile efforts on so manyplatforms from radio to books to a documentary film. Perhaps only theimpossibility of getting music clearances has stopped it from
producing a boxed set of jazz music. Sure, you can tell any story in any
way you want. But a play seems especially unlikely for this particulartale and that instinctive response is borne out here. The jumble of aset, the murky lighting, the stabs at humanity from a cast burdened by
clichés, the way the past and present overlap constantly -- it's all in
faithful service to the material, but the material is wrong for the stage.
Even the brief dramatic moments that almost work are undercut. At
one moment, director Christopher McElroen and his creative teamstrive to capture the way this loft, this world, was awash in creativity.
Photographic images overlay the entire stage, flashing by in a blur. The
live band onstage wails away. For a second, you feel the excitement.But then Myth is shown rushing across the stage with a clothesline,THEATER: "The Glass

<p>attaching it from one wall to another and displaying a string of new
prints. Then he grabs another clothesline and does it again. The other
actors struggle to stay out of the way, the clothesline knocks over this
or that prop, it's chaotic and pointless since they'd already capturedthe energy of the moment...and then Myth runs around toimmediately take it all down. As if that weren't enough, he then claps
his hand and twirls around in full hep-cat mode. In short, (A)loft
Modulation never gets out of its own way. And to add to the irony, itrarely shows any modulation since a vaguely hysterical note of Art!and Ideas! is struck from start to finish.
The one element this show gets right is the music. An original song by
Grammy nominee Gerald Clayton opens act two, ably hinting at themagnum opus that Julliard professor is laboring away on. The rest ofthe night, the action is happily punctuated by the Loft Band, featuringJonathan Beshay on saxophone, Kayvon Gordon on drums and AdamOlszewski on bass. Whether riffing on classic jazz tunes or heading offinto space on pure improvisation, they keep the audience assured that
no matter the dramatics, pretty soon they'll be playing again. The Loft
Band jams before the play begins, during part of the intermission andthroughout the play itself. Like the endlessly philosophizing Myth, theplay starts to feel like the person at the back of a club who won't stop
talking during a set. You want to shush them up and just keep listening
to the band.
