            <p>Darlene Love isthe holidays ff+:till;;d,
all you need at Christmastime
I t doesn't seem possible. tcgendary
I sirger Darlene Love has been at the
I hearl of Christmas music for decades
I She was a key voice on the very
flrst rock'n' roll holiday album: Phil
Spector's 1963 classic, "A Christmro Gift
for You " And she's popped up during
the holidays ever since, on the radio and
on movie soundtracks, plus her anaual
concerts in New York and appeumces
on "Late Show W-rth David lâ‚¬ttemm,"
where she reliably shows up this time of
year to sing her classic "Christmas (Baby
Please Come Home) " Her concert this
year is Dec l7 at Lincoln Center.
Yet ber new CD, "lt's Chdstmas, Of
Course!," is billed as Love's veryfirst
solo Christmas album.
"'She never put out a Christmas CD?'
Most people when they beil that proba-
bly won't believe it!" laughs Love aboutthe album "But I wasn't the only one on
that Spector album " (It also contained,
of course, the Ronettes, the Crystals and
Bob B So:or and the Blue Jeans )
"I've never actually put out an offi-
cial Darlene Inve Christmas CD," says
Love, whose new album tackles contem-
porary holiday gems by the likes of Tom
Petty, the Pretenders, XTC and others,
all of which sound like classics as soon
ec chp cinoe than
Well. it's about time. since Ms lnve
owns the holiday,
"I thirk I do They call me the Chdst-
mro Queen," she says "Everybody is
[the royaltyl of sometling Aretha is
the Queen of Soul EMs was the King
of Rock 'n' Roll - and I'm the Queen of
Christmas "
Does that mean she could just work
two months out of the vear and coast onu{:?li','.';*,m""'- ffix:f i*iv:y:::,'11..,^,, ^*ffiaU that hol.iday joy?
"I've tried that, md it doesn't work,"
says lnve "Two months out of the year

plays Motomouth Maybelle
in "Hairspray." She'd like to
tum her Christmas concert-
a l7-year tradition - into
bigger extravaganza
"We want to make it an evenl,
Love. "We want people to
come to New York to see
it We're working up to
that, but like everything,
it takes time " a

aI s two years a tradition? Aimee Mam cenainJy
I hopes so. Exlausted fronr her previous a.lbum,
A Nlann delivered a Christmas CD last year ("One
I More Drifter in the Snow) and embarked on a
shoft tour with an engaging, oddball variety-show
mix of music, comedy and special guests
It worked, and this year she's doing 15 shoWs
(almost double that of last year) Mam says she's
planning to nrake the holiday jaunt an amual
tradition She'll perform this Wednesday at
Manhaftan Center
"lt was really, really iun," Mann says of last
year's show This year's rotating guests will in-
clude Joe Henry Grant-Lee Phillips, Josh Ritter,
Ben Lee, Chuck Prophet, quirlqr cutie Nellie McK-
ay and comic Paul E Tompkins, who emcees in
New York and who ManI says inspired the whole
shebang (HopetuIly,
Philips will tag along
for the show here;
in 2006, his nana-
tion of Dr
Scuss' book
"How the
cdnch Stole
Christmas"
as Mann tjimade even the smallest baby boomer hearts glad )
"This yer we may tilt a little more towad music,
and I won't insist everyone play Christmas songs,"
says Mam "We might include some film orvideo "
Mann has a CD coming out in early 2008, but
says this tour is something to look forward to as
the year comes to a close
"It's more fun fthan a regular tour] but it's also
more stressful, because we really don't know
what's going to happen," says the 47-year-old sing-
er, who's married to musician Michael Pem "It's
nice doing a Christmas show because it really gets
you in the holiday mood In Boston [where her
career started], I used to play Santa Claus for ev-
erybody and have everyone who didn't have any-
where to go come to my house.
"This show is trying to get you back to when
Christmas was fun And for most people, the last
purely happy memory of Christmas was probably
when they were 8 years old "
But just because she's touring with a Christmas
show. don'l assume Mann is holiday crazy.
"All my Christmas spirit comes from onstage,"
says the singer-songwriter, who won Academy
Award nominations for her songs for the mov-
ie "Magnolia " "Seriously. I'm not
going to have time to buy
Christmas presents " a
(wednesday,
Manhattan Centel
crand Ballroom,
212-307-7171)Kiki & Herb are comin'to town
othing goes toBether like Kiki and Herb and Christmas
"Somehow when we do these Christmas shows," says
perfomer Justin Bond, "it manages to focus what the
thrust of what Kiki and Herb are all about
Created by Bond and Kenny Melman in the early '90s, Kiki
and Herb are a cynically sentimental, rather inebriated duo
that does wickedly fumy covers of everj,thing from Broadway
tunes to Britney Spears to Niwana They're at Camegie Hall
Wednesday in a new show, "The Second Coming "
It'll surely be another dizzying musical iourney laced with
monologues that mix autobiographical tales of how the two
chilacters met in an institution in the 1930s and have blzed
through the entertainment industry ever since
"There's something about the holidays that Iends a pow-
er to the shows that is different from what we do during
the rest of the year," says Melman "There's always been
a touch of sweetness to it " Tony-nominated ior their re
cent Broadway run, the New York denizens' first CD,
2000's "Do You Hear What We Heat" was a Christ-
mas album whose selections ranged from "Frosty the
Snoman" to the iM+A*S*H' tbeme. Johnv Mandel's
"Suicide Is Painless."
I "Most people don't begin with a Christmas album,"
says Melman "We just thought we'd cut to the chase "
"The first perfomance I ever did," adds Bond, "was
when I was 18 months old and I did a little speech at a
Christmas pageant That was my f,rst appearance on stage.
So maybe it's some sort of primal perfomance thing." O
