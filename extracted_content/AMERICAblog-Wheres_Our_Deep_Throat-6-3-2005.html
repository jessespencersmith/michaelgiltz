6/03/2005 10:04:00 AMNumerous accounts of the unmasking of Deep Throat havepointed out one incontrovertible fact -- if he hadn't comeforward and fed Woodward and Bernstein info and proddedthem along, the Watergate story would probably have died andNixon's misdeeds might never have come to light.Here's my question: where the hell is our Deep Throat,someone in the government who will risk their careers byeither coming forward publicly or giving hard evidence torespected journalists?Where is one general, just ONE general who will resign andspeak out because they know it goes against everythingAmerica stands for to mock the Geneva Convention, risk futuremistreatment of American soldiers by our enemies and simplylacks human decency to treat human beings the way we'retreating prisoners by shipping them off for torture when we'renot doing it ourselves?Where is one general to resign or at least provide evidence toput the lie to Cheney and Rumsfeld's claims that it is absurd tocriticize our treatment of prisoners (most of whom we'veacknowledged have no useful intelligence and are basicallyinnocent).Where is one general to resign and say Bush's mistreatment ofthe National Guard etc is endangering the future security of ourcountry? That we have and do need more soldiers on theground in Iraq as suicide bombings and the insurgency growweek by week?Where is one White House official sickened by Bush's paying offof journalists and calculating manipulation of the media whowill slip info to journalists about who planted Jim Guckert/JeffGannon in the press room as a stooge to throw softballquestions at the president?Where is one US official who will release the US equivalent ofthe Downing Street memo that will prove the smoking gunconfirming Bush cooked the evidence to back up the invasion ofIraq he'd been planning all along?What scandal that has dropped of the radar do YOU wishsomeone in government would have the courage to rekindle?
