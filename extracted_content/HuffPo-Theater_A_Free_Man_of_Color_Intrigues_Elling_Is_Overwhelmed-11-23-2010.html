A FREE MAN OF COLOR  ** 1/2 out of ****
At Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont
Writer John Guare's first new play on Broadway in 18
years FEELS like his first new play in 18 years. It isambitious, overstuffed and fascinating, even though it
never clicks. But the talent onstage -- both Guare's
writing and the cast dedicated to bringing it (fitfully)to life -- is impressive. The story is set mostly in New
Orleans, a city depicted as a paradise of sorts in 1801.
A free man of color like Cornet (Jeffrey Wright) canbed the women, bedazzle the men and enjoy life to the
fullest. Slaves exist in New Orleans but they have
certain rights and can and do attain freedom. So not heaven, but a far sight better than the United States
at the time.
The bitter irony is that when New Orleans joins the United States thanks to the Louisiana Purchase, life
becomes worse for many people in that city. The US might be an inspiration to the world and its idealthat "all men are created equal" was stirring. It just wasn't true, not in practice and not any longer in
New Orleans. (And let's not even mention the women.)
This growing realization that the US had fallen short of its promise is mirrored in the show, which begins
as a frothy romp (complete with rhymed couplets a la La Bete ) and ending in a dark and serious vein as
Cornet lambastes Thomas Jefferson. Unfortunately, dozens of actors and rhymes tumbling on top of each
other never do more than modestly amuse. Wright gives a wonderfully precise performance that knows
exactly where the play is emotionally at every stage but he can't find the jokes because there simply aren't
that many in a story of a lothario surrounded by idiotic men and fawning women overwhelmed by hislarge endowment. (Really, Mr. Guare? Tongue in cheek doesn't make something any less thuddingly
obvious.)

<p>Mos (the rapper and actor who has apparently shortened his name from Mos Def) offers the richest vein
of humor as a slave who works for Cornet with grudging effectiveness. (Mos also doubles as the Haitian
revolutionary Toussaint L'Ouverture.) But there's an awful lot of moving parts at work just to deliver
some smiles.
Everyone seems happier when the tone shifts to despair. "Hang on!" is the imperative that slaves and
once-free men of color are urged to embrace and the audience surely feels the same as the show nears
the three hour mark and our hero's journey is somehow entangled with that of Meriwether Lewis (PaulDano) the explorer who helped map America but never shook his existential despair over the experience.
George C. Wolfe directs with his usual, masterful fluidity. For such a confused, rambling show, Wolfe
always maintains a flow and flair that lets us believe much more is happening than truly is. The cast is
uniformly solid and the staging as unstinting as one would expect from Lincoln Center. Usually oneneeds to see an opera to enjoy a cast this multitudinous and talented in service of a plot this needlesslycomplicated.
What others are saying:Ben Brantley of The New York Times  said,  "[Guare] seems less to be juggling than tossing bright balls of
allusion and information onto the stage and praying that they'll land in a coherent pattern."
Jeremy Gerard of Bloomberg  gave it 3 out of 4 stars and said, "A sprawling, frequently messy play, it jolts
from stylized comedy to satire to funereal dirge with little regard for the discomfort of a bumpy ride."
Dan Bacalzo of Theatermania  said, "If you can make it through the dreadful first act, the play ultimately
rewards the patient theatergoer with an intriguing look at the complex political landscape in New
Orleans and beyond, at the beginning of the 19th century. But until then, John Guare's latest play is a
wearying mash-up of styles, most notably Restoration Comedy and historical drama, and George C.Wolfe's production struggles to achieve a coherent tone."
ELLING  ** out of ****
At the Ethel BarrymoreI saw Elling  in London in 2007  (my how time flies). It had a long history  -- Norwegian novels turned into
Oscar nominated films and prequels and sequels and stage shows. But I knew none of that and was a tad
confused as to how this comedy came to feature two characters with offbeat names like Elling (Dennis
O'Hare) and Kjell Bjarne (Brendan Fraser). Still, the play was conventional if effective and ultimately
quite moving. It also was staged at the Bush Theater, which I'm pretty certain would fit quitecomfortably onto the stage of the Ethel Barrymore, including the stage, the seats, and the audience.
In that intimate setting, this tale of two oddballs who are graduating from a mental institution and given
a chance to live on their own was delicate and sweet. The rhythm of the comedy as the fuss-budget Elling
offered withering comments to the oafish, sex-happy Kjell was in sync with the audience that surrounded
them in the tiny Bush.

Joke...On Broadway, unfortunately, the show by Simon Bent seems stranded. The timing of O'Hare and Fraser
(assisted by a game Jennifer Coolidge and the great Richard Easton) is thrown off by the vast expanse of
a Broadway stage. If Elling  offers anything, it's an intimate and modest pleasure. Doing it on Broadway is
like taking a magic act devoted to sleight of hand and close-up illusions and putting it in Madison Square
Garden. It doesn't help that the set is spare and cold, with blank walls overwhelming almost everythingelse. This is more Odd Couple  than Waiting For Godot  and the unforgiving atmosphere of the set and
lighting work against its charms every step of the way.
Fraser makes a fine debut and O'Hare still manages to wring laughs out of a setting that works against
the play every step of the way. Elling  asks what it means to be crazy ...no, actually it doesn't. These guys
are a bit nutty but sweet and the show never questions their need for support to get by or their ability to
live rich and full lives. The only craziness on display here is blowing up a simple little show into aBroadway event deadened by the size of the theater and an unlovable set.
What others are saying:Charles Isherwood of The New York Times  said, "Fitfully funny, thanks primarily to the energetic efforts
of Mr. O'Hare, but mostly just a puzzling fizzle."Jeremy Gerard of Bloomberg  gave it 2 1/2 out of 4 stars and said, "This would be little more than an
extended, predictable sitcom about cute crazies were it not for the utterly committed performances."David Finkle of Theatermania  said, "O'Hare, who has been flashing his quirks in local theaters for some
time, is a walking twitch and in time is wonderful as such, while Fraser gleefully deglamorizes himself
and throws himself and his imposing, fleshy physique into the role. It's their talents that often redeem a
script that too often devolves into a second-rate on-stage buddy flick."

86 FansMy partner and I have watched and enjoyed the movie "Elling" a few times, and consider it a rare
gem of a film. I was not aware that it was now a stage production . If circumstan ces ever permit, we
would, I think, enjoy attending. Thanks for the info.
I just completed Toni Morrison's novel, A'Mercy, which touches on some of the themes that seem to
be present in Mr.Guare's play. A very interestin g time in American history, that unfortunat ely isn't
discussed often anymore. Jeffrey Wright is one of the most talented actors around. Wish I was inNYC to see this production .
How was the book?
Excellent, as one would expect. My only complaint was that it was too short. It wasvery lyrical, though not as filled with ambiguous references like some of her otherwork. In other work, the story could be read on face value. (Hope that madesense, haven't ffinished my coffee yet).
Hmm. A play about a free man of African descent, based in New Orleans in the early 1800's, andcalled "A Free Man of Color." I wonder how Barbara Hambly feels about that. The actual story isobviously very different from her novel, but really--th ey couldn't come up with a different title?
The phrase was in common usage long before her book.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST
