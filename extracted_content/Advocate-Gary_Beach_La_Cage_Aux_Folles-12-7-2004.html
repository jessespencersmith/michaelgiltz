am what I am. I don't want praise. 
I don't want pity." Those iconic 
lines-a signal moment in both 
musical theater and gay histo­
ry-are ringing out 
again with the fIrst Broad­
way revival of La Cage 
aux Folies, opening De­
cember 9. 
Gary Beach, who won 
the Tony for his hilarious 
turn as fey director Roger 
De Bris in The Producers, 
plays La Cage's Albin-the 
drag diva with a maternal 
streak portrayed by N a­
than Lane in The Birdcage, 
Mike Nichols's 1996 film 
adaptation. 
Beach feels the thrill 
and the responsibility of 
that song and this show. 
"When George Hearn sang 
it [when the show fIrst hit 
Broadway in 1983]," says 
Beach, "it was the first 
time-George, of course, 
wasn't gay-where a gay 
character stood up and 
said, 'This is what I am. 
And I don't hate myself, 
and I really don't care if 
you don't like what I'm 
doing. I'm strong enough 
to say that.' That was a 
pretty incredible moment, 
and it's still valid now." 
The first time he per­
formed the song during au­
ditions, Beach was a wreck. 
"You need an intermission 
after singing 'I Am What I 
Am,'" he laughs. He knew 
the show was great fun, but 
any questions he had as to 
its importanc e soon vanished. 
"When I got the call about this re­
vival, my fIrst thought was, Does the 
world need to see La Cage aux FolIes 
now?" says Beach, who also scored a atl 
Tony nomination for his tum as the 
candlestick Lumiere in Beauty and the 
Beast. "And I swear to you, maybe a 
week later the whole gay marriage-
New Paltz-San Francisco thing hap­
pened. I thought, Oh, my God, this ac­
tually means more now than it did 
even then." 
For an actor singing one of the most 
THE ADVOCATE 182 I DECEMBER 7, 2004 The Producers' hilarious Gary 
Beach gets his name above the 
title in La Cage aux Folies 
By Michael Giltz 
defiant "I am gay" songs around, 
Beach's own professional coming-out 
was decidedly low-key. He casually 
mentioned his partner of 15 years ("We 
used to be lovers; now we're 
partners") during interviews 
for The Producers and real­
ized while reading the arti­
cles that he'd come out. 
La Cage aux FoUes' com­
ing-out promises to be equal­
ly thrilling, with numerous 
tweaks keeping it fresh. "The 
story is still there," says 
Beach, who will also be film­
ing the movie version of The 
Producers in February. "You 
can't change that story. It's 
magnificent . But I was sent 
the script about two weeks 
before rehearsal. I opened it 
to the fIrst scene, which hap­
pened to be the scene I audi­
tioned with, and I almost 
didn't recognize it. It goes in 
a different way. It's a totally 
different entrance; a totally 
different relationship be­
tween Georges [Daniel Da­
vis 1 and Albin. The music is 
very much the same. It's a 
great Jerry Herman score. 
Why bother with it?" 
Beach is hopeful it can be 
just as exciting an opening as 
the original was for him in 
1983. "I was there the night 
before the opening," says the 
57-year-old actor, "at the very 
final preview. It was very 
thrilling. At the time-it was 
20 years ago-people said, 
'Oh, my God, Gary, you'd be 
so good in that part. Too bad 
you're too young for it.' Well, 
they can't say that anymore.'" •
