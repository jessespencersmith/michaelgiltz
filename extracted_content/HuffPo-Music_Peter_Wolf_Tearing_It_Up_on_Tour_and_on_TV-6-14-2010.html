You could say that Huffington Post has been solidly
behind Peter Wolf's latest solo album Midnight
Souvenirs .
Let's see. Sal Nunziato let you know it was a killerback in March.
Michael Bialis cross-posted his in-depth profile of
Wolf for No Depression  in April.
Jesse Kornbluth raved in May that MidnightSouvenirs is the CD of the year.  (Or the digital
download of the year, if you prefer your music in ones
and twos.)
Sal Nunziato gave his typically rambling, insightful, personal review of a tremendous concert featuringWolf and Bettye LaVette in NYC in late May  that made you feel like you'd actually been there. (He doesn't
review concerts so much as recreate the feeling he had while attending them.) That appeared on his ownwebsite, but he's such a HuffPost regular it counts.
I even gave a shout out to the CD in an unconnected post about another great CD of the year from
Sharon Jones.
And why not? It's easily one of the most entertaining, wildly raucous and just plain exciting albums of
2010. (Wolf was a key member of the J. Geils Band and for some reason his solo work has never gained
as much attention as that group -- God knows why.)
I was gutted to miss that concert with Wolf and LaVette. But I have been catching him on TV, where Wolf
has been incredibly captivating. (Have I used enough positive adverbs for you yet? Buy the CD)
Here he is on David Letterman's show singing "I Don't Wanna Know."

During...Tell me that wasn't awesome. It's really hard to give a good performance on TV. And even if you do, the
studio audience -- which has spent hours waiting in line and then sat through 50 minutes of talk -- simply
isn't primed for a concert, so they rarely respond with energy. But the roof almost came off the place forWolf. He's playing in Boston with the J. Geils Band for a show, which is so exciting I'd make a road trip
if I thought I could get good seats for less than $1000. I'm not sure why his tour was so abbreviated. It
only hit a few cities in May. Here's hoping you'll be smart enough to buy his CD and that will send Geilsback out on the road before the end of the year.

I flew from San Francisco to New York to see Peter Wolf and Bettye Lavette at the Highline
Ballroom, which was as far west as Wolf's tour was going to go. It was the best show that I haveseen in many years. Buy both of their CDs (Bettye Lavette's is entitled "Interpret ations: The British
Rock Songbook" and features her amazing rendition of Pete Townsend's "Love Reign O'er Me" fromthe Kennedy Center).
I saw Peter Wolf at the last stop on his tour, at the State Theater in Fairfax VA (near Washington
DC). It was one of the best shows I have ever seen. He was in amazing voice with terrific stage
presence-- he is truly ageless. And "Midnight Souvenirs" should win the Grammy for Album of the
Year. There is not a bad cut on it and some songs are true new classics. People will be listening tothat CD in 100 years....
Michael Giltz is an ultra-enli ghtened, pure-heart ed entertainm ent journalist among tedious hacks.
Are you kidding me? Peter Wolfe and Bettye LaVette! Epic! How I wish I could have been there.
I don't care if they wobble like a ....
or talk with a lisp
I still think I'm a good lover if the dollar bills are crisp.
And my favorite.. .I don't care if you got yourself a rash,all I want is your pretty green cash.(Writ ten
