11/09/2004 11:46:00 AMThe latest prison stats are out and while convictions of violentcrimes continue to fall, the prison population continues to rise.Among the most disheartening figures: almost 1 in 10 of allblack men between the ages of 25-29 are in jail right now. 44percent of all state and federal prisoners are black.I'm no bleeding heart liberal when it comes to crime and I holdeach individual responsible for their actions. (The vast majorityof people who are desperately poor DON'T commit crimes.)Society has clearly failed when an entire class of people are sobedeviled by helplessness and despair and a culture ofviolence.USA Today breaks it down by state. The clear winner? Texas, ofcourse, with 162,000 behind bars. And it's not just becausethey've got so many people. Texas matched Louisiana,Alabama and Oklahoma for the highest rate of incarceration bypopulation.According to the Washington DC-based Sentencing Project, halfof all prisoners are serving time for non-violent offenses.
