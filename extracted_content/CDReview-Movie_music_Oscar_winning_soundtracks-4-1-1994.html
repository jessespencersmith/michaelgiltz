ALADDIN (1992 )

WALT DISNEY 60B46-1 
Performance * * * 
Sound Quality * * * * 
Awitty romp with Robin WiLliams proving a 
capable comic singer and Brad Kane an 
especially appealing hero. Alan Menken's score, 
however, is merely competent during the action 
scenes. And points must be taken off for the now­
obligatory pop single tacked on at the end. Collec­
tors should search out early pressings for the origi­
nal "Arabian Nights" opener. Its line describing a 
land "Where they cut off your earlIf they don't 
like your face" has since been altered in deference 
to Arab American sensibilities. 
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST(1991)

Apinnacle in the collaboration between com­
poser Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ash­
man. Along with the showstoppers ("Be Our Guest" 
and "Gaston"), Beauty and the Beast features "Belle," a 
yearning number about the need to break free; 
"Something There," a sweet tune about the stirrings 
of love; and a handful of other equally good num­
bers. Menken's darkly romantic writing for strings 
during the climax is especially memorable.

Amournful, hushed masterpiece from John

scene like "Pawnee Attack," the music somehow 
maintains an air of resignation. It's the sound of a

Not nearly as good as you might remember. 
Quite a few songs are perfunctory, and 
Ariel's signature tune, "Part of Your World," is just 
a rough draft for "Belle" in Beauty and the Beast. The 
highlights belong to Sebastian the Crab, who high­
kicks it through "Under the Sea" and the infectious, 
reggae-tin ged "Kiss the Girl." The instrumenta l 
passages simply mimic the on-screen action rather 
than commenting or expanding on it. Alan Menken 
quickly proved himself capable of much more.

<p>Iy florid in its engaging way. But Byrne's music, 
including "Main Title Theme," is exceptional: 
Spare, elegant, and inventively orchestrated, it 
makes you long to hear more from him. The music 
is grouped by composer rather than chronological­
ly and suffers for it.

The performances in this marvelous homage to 
jazz were recorded live, giving the movie and 
its soundtrack a charged, exciting feel. Herbie 
Hancock shepherded an all-star lineup including 
Bobby McFerrin, Ron Carter, and Dexter Gordon 
through standards like "Body and Soul" and a few 
sterling originals. The highlights are endless, but 
one might single out the title track and Chet 
Baker's sublime vocals on "Fair Weather." 
OUT OF AFRICA (1985)

MCA MCAD·6158 
Performance * * 
Sound Qualit y * * * 
Aquiet, nondescript score from John Barry 
that worked well enough in the movie yet 
has no strong identity of its own. "Have You Got a 
Story for Me?" contains a particularly banal solo 
for piano, and "Flying Over Africa" and even 
"Main Title (I Had a Farm in Africa)" fade quickly 
from memory. Mozart, however, rose to the occa­
sion by providing a fine Conce-rto in A jin-Clarinet. 
A PASSAGE TO INDIA (1984) 
Lean by Jane-Maurice Jane's 
Musical Tribute to David Lean 
MILAN 74321 101ll·2 
Perform ance * * 
Sound Quality * * * * 
Arecordin g of four suites from Maurice 
Jane's scores for director David Lean, as 
well as an overture and a minor tune Jarre wrote 
for Lean's wedding. Acting as conductor, Jarre 
tends to emphasize the bombastic aspects of his 
music. The suite from A Passage to India is a rather 
droll sendup of tourists out to have an "adventure ." 
But the cue from the incident in the caves is shorn 
of its power, and, overall, the music from Ryan's 
Daugbte-r, DOct01-Zbivago, and the rest tend to can­
cel one another out in this setting.

Performance * * * *

Noone ever accused composer Bill Conti of 
shying away from a grandiose statement. On Tbe Right Stuffhis natural inclinations met the 
perfect material. The result is sweeping, heart­
pounding music that charges along with gleeful 
abandon, so cocky and sure of itself you can't help 
but grin. "Breaking the Sound Barrier" (which 
nearly does) and "Yeager's Triumph" are especially 
noteworthy. Perhaps because the material was less 
interesting, N011:h and SOllth is less inspired, though 
certainly not meeker. 
E.T. THE EXTRA­

Music from the Motion Picture

Performance * * * * * 
Sound Quality * * * * 
Steven Spielberg used special effects to 
make E.T. walk and talk, but he needed 
John Williams' soaring music to make the crea­
ture come alive. Like every other element of 
Spielberg's fable, the score is touched by a sense 
of wonder. From the sweet lyricism of "E.T. 
and Me" to the sweeping resolution of the 15 
minute final track "Adventure on Earth," this is 
grand stuff. 
CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981) 
Vangelis-Chm'iots of Fire 
POLYDOR 800 020·2 
Performance * * * * 
Sound Quality * * * * 
Synthesizer fiend Vangelis seemed a strange 
choice to score a period piece about two 
very different runners at the 1924 Olympics . But 
his distinctive, modern music quietly emphasized 
the universal nature of their struggles with the 
need to compete and win. And, of course, the track 
lifted from the title sequence proved a massive 
worldwide hit. The 20-minute closer "Chariots of 
Fire" meanders a bit, but the rest is top-notch, 
with "Abraham's Theme" especially noteworthy 
for capturing the desperate, lonely excitement of a 
runner during a race. The following year, Vangelis 
would reach perfection with his brilliant work on 
Blade Runner.

I rene Cara has the best moments here. "Fame" 
sounds a little goofy now ("Remember! Remem­
ber! Remember! Remember!" chant the back­
ground singers), but it's still fun, and "Out Here on 
My Own" is so much better than the rest that it 
seems to come from a different world. The other 
tracks-such as "Hot Lunch Jam," "Dogs in the 
Yard," and the truly awful finale "I Sing the Body 
Electric"-sound exactly like the sort of thing high 
school students with nascent talent would toss off in 
an afternoon . Appropriate, perhaps, but not very 
enjoyable.

Performance * * * * 
Sound Quality * * * * 
The great Georges Delerue seems caught up in 
the blush of first love in this breezy score. 
Drawing upon Vivaldi for several themes, he 
strikes just the right tone of benevolence and 
breathless excitement. The solo piano in "The 
Birthday Party" and the lovely waltz of "Julius 
Edmond Santorin" are especially memorable, but 
it's all a delight, as is the movie.

Vangelis he ain't. Giorgio Moroder has a 
decent riff or two buried in "Chase" and 
some nicely atmospheric touches in "Cacaphoney." 
But this is plodding stuff, the sort of electronic noodling that gives synthesizers a bad name. Two 
songs -"Theme from Midnight Express" with 
Chris Bennett and "Istanbul Blues" with David 
Castle-are just painful.

Everything one could hope for in a boxed set. 
The sound quality is uniformly excellent, 
the scores for the individual movies are more com­
plete than ever, the CDs are properly sequenced 
with miscellaneous cues appearing on a fourth disc, 
and the booklet is lavishly detailed. The music, of 
course, is a landmark achievem~ nt; John Williams 
almost singlehandedly reawakened public interest 
in traditional movie music. George Lucas once said 
he knew Stal· Wan would succeed when Darth 
Vader first appeared and audiences began to boo, 
rather than laugh as he feared. The truth is that he 
should have known as soon as Williams turned in</p>
<p>his score: 0 one could write a theme as grand and 
stirring as the "Main Title" unless the movie that 
followed would deliver in spades.

Astory about parents whose adopted son turns 
out to be the anti-Christ hardly calls for 
restraint. But even by horror standards, this Jerry 
Goldsmith score is a bit overwrought with strings 
flailing about and ominous choral arrangements at 
every turn. Effective, in a sledgehammer sort of 
way-even quiet-seeming tracks are guaranteed to 
explode into mayhem or at least contain some 
whispering voices to keep the audience from relax­
ing. A good example of Oscar honoring a talented 
composer at the wrong time:

Its gripping "Main Title" theme has rightly 
entered the popular consciousness and kept more 
than a few people out of the water. There are some 
lighter moments such as "Promenade (Tourists on 
the Menu)" and heroic passages like "Preparing the 
Cage." But John Williams is much more forceful 
and convincing when the hunt is on. Whether that 
hunt involves the Great White tracking down 
humans or humans tracking down the Great White 
seems not to matter: He's gleeful either way.

Fellini favorite Nino Rota graced Francis Ford 
Coppola 's sequel with more powerful but 
lonely music. Rota's old world tunes are weighted 
down by a deep melancholia, even during domestic 
scenes. It's brilliant and memorable, just like his 
work on The Godfather . But the CD contains only 
about 20 minutes of his work-the rest is incidental 
music by Cannine Coppola and some Italian songs. 
Surely more could be gleaned from a movie more 
than three hours long.

B arbra Streisand is luminous on the title

The rest is nondescript big band takes on standards like "In the Mood" and syrupy Marvin Hamlisch

pears briefly when "The Way We Were" is 
reprised in the finale. It's hardly worth the wait.

Performance * * * * 
Sound Quality * * * * 
Complete scores are always preferable to com­
pilations such as this. But so little of Chaplin's 
music is available on CD and this is so well done that 
it seems churlish to quibble. There's a suite from 
Modern Times, several tracks from Monsiem- VeI-dozlX 
and A King in New Y01-k, and individual cuts from 
other films. Limelight is represented by "Eternally," a 
brashly sentimental tune of the sort that Chaplin had 
a gift for. (This CD doesn't reproduce the scores. 
The works are newly orchestrated treatments and 
sometimes drift far afield from the source.)

Composer Francis Lai struck gold-and 
apparendy exhausted his musical imagina­
tion-wid1 "Theme From Love Story," an over­
ripe number repeated endlessly on piano, harpsi­
chord, and strings. There are two very bad tracks 
in which a singer wordlessly vocalizes over strum­
ming guitars, with "Snow Frolic" edging out "I 
Love You, Phil" for the silliness award. And "Skat­
ing in Central Park" sounds wmerving ly nonde­
script. If you seem to recall a piece or two that 
wasn't nearly that bad, it's probably the Mozart or 
Bach thrown in for good measure.

"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" is pleasant,

things to say about the disc.

Far from the best work of David Lean or Mau­

one of their biggest hits. "Lara's Theme" is repeated 
over and over to no great effect and the gloomy 
male chorus in "Revolution" and elsewhere sounds 
muddy and unconvincing . Even the use of ethnic 
instruments sounds merely like an accent, rather 
than an organic part of the score as it does on Jarre's 
Lawrence of Arabia and The Man Who Would Be King.

ASpoonfui of Sugar," "Chim Chim Cher-ee," 
and "Su percalifragilisti cexpia lidocious." 
They're all well-known and Julie Andrews and 
Dick Van Dyke perform them with a witty self­
awareness . None of this is surprising. What is sur­
prising is the high quality of the other tunes. "Sis­
ter Suffragette " and "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank" are 
clever little gems, with "The Perfect Nanny" not 
far behind. The movie may be dated, but the 
songs, virtually all of them, are timeless.

Here is Maurice Jarre in all his glory, combin­

the darbuka with a full orchestra to give himself 
access to an ever-widening palette. With it, Jarre 
manages to convey the inner struggle of Lawrence , a 
struggle never fully articulated in the movie's action. 
Thoughtful, intelligent, but above all dynamic and 
exciting, the score is a complete triumph.

While not nearly as epochal as his work on 
Peter Gunn several years earlier, Henry 
Mancini's jazz stylings have a finger-snapping, hep

given far more definite treatment elsewhere. EXODUS (1960)

This isn't a review of the score for Exodus. It's 
a review of the music presented on this CD 
which, incidenta lly, serves as a paradigm for a 
botched job. Individual cuts are clearly truncated, 
almost stopping in mid note at several points. 
Why? The movie was about three-and-a-half 
hours long, so there certainly was no shortage of 
cues. The sound also is terrible: thin, harsh, and 
accompanied by a loud hiss. Composer Ernest 
Gold might well have composed a good or even 
great piece. From this disc, it's impossible to tell.

Asprawling achievement by Miklos Rozsa that 
quotes liberally from his entire career, sum­

he was a great composer and reportedly had an aston­
ishing 18 months to work on the music, one would 
expect no less. Singling out individual cuts, however 
distinctive, would be misleading: Ben-Hul-is a singu­

commenting on itself to achieve its emotional power.

When the Academy Award went to composer 
Malcolm Arnold, the people who honored 
him were probably whisding the "Colonel Bogey" 
march, the one melody everyone who saw the 
movie remembers. However, it was written by 
Kenneth J. Alford (who also contributed a fine 
march to LaWI-ence of AI-abia) and performed by 
Mitch Miller and His Orchestra. Arnold, who 
composed and conducted the rest, did a merely 
serviceable job on the music and-one presumes­
quietly took home the Oscar before anyone could 
change his or her mind.

Including dialogue on a soundtrack generally is a 
terrible idea, but every rule has its exception. 
Here, so much dialogue is included that it turns this 
CD into a virtual radio play. As such, it is a complete 
success. Even someone unfamiliar with the story-if 
there is someone-would have no trouble following 
the basic plot. And the songs are among the most 
engaging ever written directly for the screen.

By drawing so well upon the operatic use of 
motifs for individual characters, Erich Wolf­
gang Korngold helped shape the art of movie 
music. In the process, he created classics that few 
would ever equal. Robin Hood's signature trumpet 
melody and the other central themes are brilliantly 
reconfigured in scene after scene of endless, won­
derful action. Korngold achieved the ultimate goal 
of a composer: His music stands triumphantly on its 
own, but it's impossible to imagine the movie with 
any other accompaniment. ANTHONY ADVERSE (1936)

Since few people have actually seen the 
movie it was written for, this is an excellent 
chance to hear a thoughtful, intelligent score 
unencumbered by a film's images. Korngold's 
work has all the traditional attributes of movie 
music: brief melodic ideas that are repeated and 
varied, abrupt swings in tempo that pass as quickly 
as they arrive, and an unabashed love of drama. 
The charms of a score are idiosyncratic, to be sure, 
but no less valid for it.
