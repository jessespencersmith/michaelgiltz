            <p>Z I assandra's Dream," Woody Allen's latest drama,f f opening Jan. 18, takes plaie in London just like his
f last two films. But that's not the only echo of the
Upast. The doomed prophetess Cassandrawas fated
to accurately predict the future but be ignored. Noq Al-
len's body of work is so vast it's diffrcult for him to man-
ufacture wen the quirkiest plot twist that doesn't resem-
ble a device from one of his earlier frlms.
In his latest, two brothers @wan McGregor and Co-
lin Farrell) agree to murder a business associate of their
wealthyuncle in exchange forhis financial help, which
they desperately need. Here's a rundourn of the movie's
high points that riff on earlier efforts by the Woodman.
In "Gassandta's Dt€am,'McGregor and Farrell's moth-
er (Clare Higgins) is always running down her husband,
when she's not nagging the boys, that is. All out of love.
In Tale the lloney and Rm' (1969), Virgil Stark-
well's (Allen) parents nag him about his career plans,
which are to be a career criminal. But they do it all out of
love; it's just that they feel more comfortable disguising
themselves bywearing Groucho noses and glasses when
talking aboutVirgil on camera.
In"Gassandnb Dreamr"McGregor ddes an actress
ftfa$eyatwelt) wtro is besieged with male admirers,
turcludhg a weahtry bhrc blood wtro invites both her and
McGregorto his cqffiry estate for a party. McGregor also
ptays v/eathy by takhg the CIp€nsive afromobiles his
broth€r r€pairs for a spin wtrcn he's on a date.
kr'Mdt Fohe (2005), Jonattran Rfrfn Mgrers is

Hewett (Matthov Goode). Rhys Mqrcrs decides he likes the
good life so mudr that he marries Hewetfs mousy sis:ter to
guarantee a place at the table.
In'Gassandrds Druam'" Unde Horvard CIom Wilkinson)
asks the two brothers to eliminafe a business associate wtro
rafher annoying$ seems determined to tell the truttr when
questioned about HCIilard's stndy dealings.
Itr'gimes and Mlrdennanors" (1989), a businessman
(Martin Landau) has an affairwith the increasingly
unstable and thrcatening A4ielica Huston and ultimately
decides the only reasonable thing to do is harze her killed.
hfassandra,'McGregor is the relative$ stable sbling
and Farrell the miserable sod with garnblingproblems and
an unhe$ful sense of morality. They squabble constanf$
brfr still spend more time with eadr other ttran with their
rcspective girfriends.
In'Hatnah and ller Sishrs" (1986), Mia Farrow plays
the absurdly perfect Hannah, wtrile sister Barbara Hershey
drcats on her husband with Hannahfs cunent hubby
(Midrael Caine) and Dianne Wiest is her drug-addicted
other sisteB who dates Hannah's ex-husband (Woody
Allen). Despite their constant complaining, the sisters never
go two minutes withotrt worrying eadr otherwiththeir
respective problems and fears.
In'Gassandtar" McGregot's girtfriend is seen performing
some serrually naughty drama But the real drama isUactstage, wtrere etreqrone is air-kissing everyone else and
the actors are seemingly inrolved in casual nonumces.
