9/03/2005 02:07:00 PMHomeland Security head Michael Chertoff just made aremarkable claim:I can tell you that not an hour goes by that we don't spenda lot of time thinking about the people who are activelysuffering in all of these parts of the Gulf.Exactly what else SHOULD he be thinking about? How clueless can heget?Michael Chertoff is giving another clueless, tone-deaf pressconference. Everything is going great. The plans they had in placehave worked terrifically -- if they HADN'T developed these plans, theresponse in the past would have been much slower, so what you'reseeing is a "validation" [his word] of the great work and planning theBush administration has done. And who could have expected ahurricane AND a levee break. (Uh, everybody?)He's throwing out a lot of gobbledygook: the National Guard are"citizen-soldiers" (a phrase they've suddenly leaped on in the pastday) and it takes time to mobilize them. (Which is exactly why peopleare angry Bush waited SO LONG to mobilize them in sufficientnumbers and he is STILL mobilizing more today long after it waspainfully obvious there were not enough boots on the ground.Another continuing Bush tactic: "legal issues" stopped them fromdoing their job. We've posted below the legal documents signed bythe governnor of Louisiana asking for help. But do they really want usto accept that some form was signed off on and THAT'S why theresponse has been so incompetent? Do they want us to think a singleperson in this country would have objected if Bush had acted sooner,if Homeland Security had lived up to its stated mission to take controlin catastrophic natural disasters? (Read their own website below.)And golly, we're diving into national stockpiles to fulfill prescriptionsfor only the second time in history. Ain't that great? What the helldoes he think those stockpiles are for?
