Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayOh dear, the headmistress of St. Etheldreda's School For Girls is dead. Not that the seven young women dumped atthis lesser finishing school in the late 1800s are terribly upset. The headmistress was the sort of person who fed hercharges bread and butter while she dined on veal. So no great loss. But the seven young women -- all givenidentifying names like Clever Kitty and Stout Alice and Disgraceful Mary Ann (she's quite the flirt) -- are very fond ofeach other and know the minute word gets out the school will be disbanded and they'll all be sent home and neversee each other again. So, naturally, they bury their headmistress in the garden and convince Stout Alice to imitatethe old meanie when necessary. You won't be surprised that complications ensue, such as a stream of visitors andbusybodies, the wooing of said headmistress by the kindly old Admiral, and most concerning of all the realization thatthe headmistress was in fact poisoned and the killer is prepared to strike again. Berry's novel plays like a Britishfarce, with much of the action taking place over a very short span of time and the silly device of a teenager girldressing up as a dowdy old woman. It's very amusing, from the clever introduction -- where we are told the variousawful reasons why these delightful girls have been shipped off to this dire academy -- through the expected but stillsatisfying finale. While all the girls are "types" -- the one who loves science, the one who is dim, the one who is soft-hearted and sweet and so on -- they also manage to surprise themselves and each other (and us) with theirversatility. It's all nonsense, thank goodness. And while one doesn't quite long for murder -- that would be improper --one does imagine that these seven sisters will face other adventures in the future. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say"Berry's prose is reminiscent of the dark comedy and melodrama of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes"mysteries . . . This is a well-researched, clever, and deliciously dark comedy with an emphasis on femaleempowerment." - School Library Journal"Immensely entertaining, smart, and frothy." - The Horn Book"... beautifully written, with rich vocabulary, charming details, spunky dialogue, and plucky heroines . . . delightfullyzany." - VOYA*"Romance blooms in unexpected places, and danger lurks around every corner in this delightfully farcical tale, full oftwists and turns." -Publisher's Weekly STARRED REVIEW What You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
