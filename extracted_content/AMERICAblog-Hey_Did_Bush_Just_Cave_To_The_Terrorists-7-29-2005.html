7/29/2005 06:00:00 AMI posted earlier about our top general in Iraq saying they couldstart a major pullout in the spring (just in time for the 2006elections oddly enough). Mostly, I made fun of the fact that theonly condition he was really trying to set was that theinsurgency not get any worse. That seems a pretty patheticstandard since the insurgency is stronger than ever.But lots of threaders pointed out the obvious: Bush had just seta deadline. He certainly can't pretend conditions in Iraq haveimproved -- more people are dying this year than last year andmore people were dying last year than the year before. AndBush insisted it was heresy to set a deadline to pull out -- ifyou do that, all the insurgents have to do is wait you out. Nowthey know they can hunker down (or even keep killing our menand women at the record levels they've been achieving) andwe'll still be out in the spring of 2006.How can Bush justify setting a deadline when Iraq is worse offnow than it was a year ago? How can Bush justify setting adeadline when he insisted this would help the insurgents? Howcan Bush justify talk of pulling out when the Iraqis only haveabout 12,000 troops even minimally trained -- and most ofthem are only capable of fighting with our help? How can Bushjustify going back on his word?
