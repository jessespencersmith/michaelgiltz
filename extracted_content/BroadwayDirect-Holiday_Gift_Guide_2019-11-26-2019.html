By Elton John
$30, Henry Holt & Co.
Home Work: My Hollywood Years
By Julie Andrews
$30, Hachette Books
Too Much Is Not Enough
By Andrew Rannells
$26, Crown Archetype
Here are three great biographies from musical-theater mainstays.
Elton John is the most successful pop star turned Broadway composer in history. So his chatty,
compulsively readable memoir covers drugs and rock ’n’ roll dreams. But he also dishes on 
The Lion King,
Aida, 
and 
Billy Elliot
. (Of course, we wanted even more on 
Lestat
.)
Julie Andrews’s second autobiography focuses on her Hollywood years. That means familiar stories about
The Sound of Music
 and 
Mary Poppins.
 It 
also
 means stories about other movies that celebrated, began on,
or ended up on stage, movies like 
Star!, Thoroughly Modern Millie,
 and culminating with her triumph in
Victor/Victoria.
 Who can ever get enough Julie Andrews?
Actor Andrew Rannells doesn’t have the résumé of the other two superstars yet. But he does have 
The
Book of Mormon
 and 
Hairspray
 and 
The Boys in the Band,
 to name a few of his successes. Not too shabby.
His memoir takes the Steve Martin tack and charmingly focuses on his childhood, his first love, and his
artist’s life 
before
 that big break.</p>
<p>A Is for Audra: Broadway’s Leading Ladies from A to Z 
By John Robert Allman (author) and Peter Emmerich (illustrator)
$18.99, Doubleday Books for Young Readers
Double Bass Blues 
By Andrea J. Loney (author) and Rudy Gutierrez (illustrator)
$17.99, Knopf Books for Young Readers
Feed Your Mind: A Story of August Wilson 
By Jen Bryant (author) and Cannaday Chapman (illustrator)
$17.99, Abrams Books for Young Readers
Is it ever too soon to preach the joys of theater to little kids? No, it is not! These three picture books make
a great introduction.
To be honest, 
A Is for Audra
 is a picture book that’s even better for adults than kids. Tykes will get a little
instruction (“P is for Patti!”). But adults get to argue over which artist should claim which letter of the
alphabet. (B is for Bernadette? Barbra? Betty Buckley?) Believe, us 26 letters are not enough.
Double Bass Blues
 is a charmer about a little boy toting home a giant double bass from school. He shines in
the orchestra with his friends … and then he shines again at his grandfather’s jazz club. The images are
great!
Finally, 
Feed Your Mind
 is a tribute to America’s greatest playwright, August Wilson. His love of reading
becomes palpable in this heartfelt celebration of the powers of a well-fed mind.</p>
<p>The Inheritance
By Matthew Lopez
$19.95, Faber & Faber
Methuen Drama’s Modern Plays: 60
 Anniversary Gift Set 
$135, Methuen Drama
In 
The Inheritance,
 Matthew Lopez’s acclaimed drama uses E.M. Forster’s novel 
Howards End
 to anchor a
sprawling drama that covers decades and spans generations. It’s an addictive, funny, and wise story that
has been enjoying as much acclaim in New York as it did in London. This is the must-read play of the
current Broadway season.
Anyone who savors owning and reading and then rereading plays knows the venerable publisher
Methuen. To celebrate their 60
 year, they held a contest to pick one key play from each decade. The
result is this lavish seven-work set that includes 
A Taste of Honey
 from the 1950s, 
Top Girls
 from the 1980s,
and finally, 
This House
 from the 2010s, to name just three. A tribute to both the authors and the company
wise enough to keep them in print.

<p>The Movie Musical!
By Jeanine Basinger
$45, Knopf
In the Long Run: A Cultural History of Broadway’s Hit Plays 
By Jordan Schildcrout
$39.15, Routledge
Listening for America: Inside the Great American Songbook From Gershwin to Sondheim
By Rob Kapilow
$39.95, Liveright
Here are three wide-ranging works that any theater fan will find impossible to resist.
Jeanine Basinger’s new book is 
The Movie Musical!,
 and you know you’re in good hands because she
included the exclamation point. Needless to say, a huge chunk of these shows began on the stage before
heading to film, or headed to the stage after their big-screen success. But any musical buff will also enjoy
her appreciation and analysis of pure movie musicals including 
The Jazz Singer
 and 
La La Land
. Read it and
you’ll be setting your DVR for months to come, trying to catch the ones you’ve missed on TCM.
Author Jordan Schildcrout lasers in on the hit play. Critics often prefer the serious, sober shows that close
in a week. But Schildcrout insists much can be learned by looking at the biggest hits from each decade. He
looks at the wide impact or telling perspectives of iconic shows such as 
Life With Father
 and 
Deathtrap
.
Needless to say, Neil Simon pops up a few times!
Public radio favorite Rob Kapilow is known for illuminating classical music with the fervor and fun of
Leonard Bernstein. Now he turns to the Great American Songbook with similar passion. His insight
combined with the ability to share it easily will deepen your knowledge of the best that Broadway has to
offer.</p>
<p>The Chelsea Girls  
By Fiona Davis
$27, Dutton
Leading Men
By Christopher Castellani
$27, Viking
City of Girls 
By Elizabeth Gilbert
$28, Riverhead Books
Dive into these three bestsellers that savor the world of the theater.
Author Fiona Davis might have her biggest hit yet with 
The Chelsea Girls, 
a 1950s-set drama about the
Chelsea Hotel, McCarthyism, and two women making their mark in the world of theater. These fast friends
decide there’s no reason they shouldn’t produce the Broadway show they want to see, though the Red
Scare might have something to say about that.
It’s no wonder author Christopher Castellani chose to base his debut novel, 
Leading Men,
 on Tennessee
Williams. That larger-than-life playwright is almost as colorful as his greatest characters. Here, Castellani
brings Williams to life without letting the man overshadow his one true love: Frank Merlo, a blue-collar guy
from New Jersey who served honorably as the right-hand man to this needy but generous genius.
Eat. Pray. Love. Go to the theatre. That’s our motto, and memoirist and best-selling author Elizabeth
Gilbert brings it to life in 
City of Girls. 
This acclaimed, sexy work is about life in the freewheeling world of
the 1940s New York theater scene. In it, Vassar College dropout Vivian is sent to NYC to live with her
bohemian aunt Peg, the owner of a wonderfully down-on-its-heels theatre called the Lily Playhouse. Since
that sounds a lot like heaven, you know that whatever stumbling blocks appear (and there are many),
Vivian’s adventure is going to be great fun.</p>
<p>The Contender: The Story of Marlon Brando
By William J. Mann
$35, Harper
Still Here: The Madcap, Nervy, Singular Life of Elaine Stritch 
By Alexandra Jacobs
$28, Farrar, Straus and Giroux
Life Isn’t Everything: Mike Nichols, As Remembered by 150 of His Closest Friends
By Ash Carter and Sam Kashner
$30, Henry Holt & Co.
Three new biographies give great theatrical talents their due.
In William J. Mann’s hefty but not exhausting new biography, he emphasizes that Marlon Brando’s real
passion was for political activism. Begin with that fact clearly in mind, he says, and Brando’s circuitous and
frustrating career isn’t so haphazard. For fans of the theater, the first third is filled with great stories about
Stella Adler, the creation of 
A Streetcar Named Desire,
 and the howl of despair in a soon-forgotten play
called 
Truckline Café
 that made the entire theater world sit up and take notice. Frustrating, wasteful,
brilliant, giant in appetites and intellect and righteous anger, Brando has never made more sense.
Speaking of Brando, Elaine Stritch studied alongside him and Harry Belafonte when she first started out.
She turned that into a great anecdote — just one of many that peppered her classic one-woman show,
Elaine Stritch: At Liberty.
 Sure, Stritch made the most of her life in that legendary performance. But a life as
dark and rich as hers deserves an outsider’s perspective, and that’s what entertainment writer Alexandra
Jacobs gives her in a book ranging gamely from the Great Depression to 
30 Rock.
Mike Nichols would be remembered forever just for his ground-breaking comedy with Elaine May. Then
you have the classic films, starting with his brilliant debut, 
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,
 starring Richard
Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. But for us, that’s all overshadowed by his impact on the theater. Sadly,
Nichols refused to write his own memoirs. 
Life Isn’t Everything
 is the next best thing: a string of anecdotes
by those who worked with this genius at every stage of his brilliant career. It’s like the Irish wake of your
dreams, peppered with tales that illuminate what made Nichols so great — and so great to work with.</p>
<p>Midsummer’s Mayhem 
By Rajani LaRocca
$16.99, Yellow Jacket
This sweet young-adult novel puts a new spin on Shakespeare’s romantic and magical play 
A Midsummer
Night’s Dream.
 Mimi is the youngest in her overachieving Indian American family and yearns to figure out
how to make her mark. A love of cooking and a contest at the local bakery seem just the ticket. Then, a
mysterious boy named Vic leads her deeper and deeper into a forest behind her house that’s bursting with
exotic, almost magical ingredients. Inspired, Mimi tries out her new skills on her family and watches as her
dad eats and eats and eats, her brother falls in love with his own image (a future actor, surely), and her
other siblings wreak havoc with sudden romantic entanglements. Hmm, it sounds a lot like … Yes, but the
fresh setting and delightful heroine make this more than just the latest variation on a play by Will.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: The Journey
By Jody Revenson
$39.99, Arthur A. Levine Books
Working Actor
By David Dean Bottrell
$16.99, Ten Speed Press
Come From Away: Welcome to the Rock — An Inside Look at the Hit Musical 
Book, music, and lyrics by Irene Sankoff and David Hein
Text by Laurence Maslon
$40, Hachette Books
For those who dream of being in the audience in person and those who just want to learn more about
how it’s done, three glimpses behind the scenes take you there.
Harry Potter and the Cursed Child
 continues to pack them in at productions circling the globe. Given it’s one
of the most elaborate stage plays in generations, a look at how the show was made and all the craft that
goes into it is long overdue. It’s no surprise that this book itself is a handsome production, filled with
photos and sketches and the determination of all involved to do J.K. Rowling proud.
Actor David Dean Bottrell has done everything from soap operas to sitcoms and dramas on TV, running
the gamut from “Patron” on one show to an acclaimed arc on 
Boston Legal.
 Bottrell also writes screenplays,</p>
<p>directs, teaches acting, and writes a column for the actors’ resource 
Backstage
. In 
Working Actor, 
he gathers
practical advice and inspiration for the newbie or the professional who’s looking for some new pointers. A
bracing dose of reality for acting students, it also makes clear that “working actor” is a lofty goal, but it can
be done.
The Canadian musical 
Come From Away
 is an honest-to-goodness, smash hit. Created by two relative
neophytes, this feel-good, based-on-real-life story with a somber 9/11 backdrop will soon be one of the
100 longest-running shows in Broadway history. 
Welcome to the Rock
 is a keepsake that includes the
complete book and lyrics, of course, but there’s more, including an intro by Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau and the usual making-of stories. More unusual, it includes new interviews with the actual airplane
passengers and Gander, Newfoundland, residents who came together that memorable and sad day when
planes were diverted in the wake of the attacks and strangers opened their doors to stranded travelers.
That focus on what really matters elevates 
Welcome to the Rock,
 just as it elevated the musical in the minds
of fans and critics who have embraced it all along.
