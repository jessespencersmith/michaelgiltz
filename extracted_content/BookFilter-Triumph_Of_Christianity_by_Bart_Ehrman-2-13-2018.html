The Triumph of Christianity
How a Forbidden Religion Swept the World
by Bart D. Ehrman
Price: $28.00 (Hardcover)
Published: February 13, 2018
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: From the New York Times  bestselling authority on
early Christianity, the story of how Christianity grew from a religion of
twenty or so peasants in rural Galilee to the dominant religion in the Westin less than four hundred years. Christianity didn’t have  to become the
dominant religion in the West. It easily could have remained a sect ofJudaism fated to have the historical importance of the Sadducees or theEssenes. In The Triumph of Christianity , Bart Ehrman, a master explainer
of Christian history, texts, and traditions, shows how a religion whose first
believers were twenty or so illiterate day laborers in a remote part of the
empire became the official religion of Rome, converting some thirtymillion people in just four centuries. The Triumph of Christianitycombines deep knowledge and meticulous research in an eye-opening,immensely readable narrative that upends the way we think about the
single most important cultural transformation our world has ever seen—
one that revolutionized art, music, literature, philosophy, ethics,economics, and law.

What We Say
In this work of scholarship for the general reader, author Bart D. Ehrman spells out why and how Christianity managed to
become so remarkably popular in an age where polytheism ruled the world. Ehrman uses everything from basic math to theallure of marketing to tell his story, which sets aside at the start any supernatural advantages. (Obviously, if God wants
your religion to succeed, well by God it's GOING to succeed.) He focuses on the practical real world questions raised by the
amazing success of a faith which began with about twenty poor people in a rural community at the time of Christ's death.Ehrman is best at putting Christianity in context, lucidly explaining that antipathy towards Christians wasn't knee-jerkShare This Book

<p>prejudice but inevitable. In a world where virtually everyone believed that if the gods weren't properly honored that
disaster would strike in the form of war or famine or disease or natural disaster and the like, a new religion that insisted
all the other gods simply didn't exist or were demons wasn't just "different" but a genuine threat to everyone's existence.
How did it grow so quickly? Looking carefully at the best available data shows it was not so spectacular but rather anexample of recruitment at a reasonable but exponentially big amount. And the appeal of Christianity? Ehrman suggests itsunique desire to proselytize and ground-breaking promise of a blissful life after death combined to make it a giant killer. Orin this case, a god(s)-killer. Ehrman runs out of steam towards the end and this is truly a work of scholarship rather than a
compelling story. But for those with an interest, it is clearly laid out and useful for placing a new faith squarely in its time
and place. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“Drawing on a wealth of ancient sources and contemporary historical research, Bart Ehrman weaves complex
questions into a vivid, nuanced, and enormously readable narrative.” - Elaine Pagels, National Book Award-
winning author of The Gnostic Gospels
“One of Christian history’s greatest puzzles after the age of the apostles  is how a tiny band of mostly-illiterate
outsiders converted the proud and massive Roman Empire in just three centuries – a historical blink of an eye. In
The Triumph of Christianity , Ehrman brings impressive research, intellectual rigor, and an instinct for
storytelling to this extraordinary dynamic.” - David Van Biema, former religion writer at Time and author of
the forthcoming Speaking to God
