Thai's all, Folk 
Russell T. DaviesJs gay series Queer as Folktook British TV by storm. 
But the show is still MIA in the United StatesJ and the spin-off never 
happened. Is it curtains for Stu and Nathan? By Michael Gillz 
If you're wondering why Queer as 
Folk-the groundbreaking British 
TV drama-still hasn't been broad­
cast anywhere in the United States 
even as its sequel heads to video in 
the United Kingdom , join the club. 
That's exactly what the show's creator, 
Russell T. Davies, is wondering as well. ''I'm not supposed to talk about this, 
but I don't care," says the 36-year-old 
writer, who set the series in his current 
hometown , Manchester, England, but is 
now sitting at Balans restaurant in Lon­
don. He pauses for a moment, thinking, 
and then rushes ahead. "No, I really don't 
care. The moment it came out it was op-
THE ADVOCATE I'" I APRIL 25,2000 COURTESY CHANNEl FOUR 
tioned by an American gay channel that 
hasn't launched yet called Cl TV. 
"Showtime's got the right to make a 
new [American version), and I hear that 
they're going to start filming this sum­
mer," Davies continues. "But the rights 
to show the original were bought by this 
group in Miami, and it cannot be re­
leased on video or DVD in the States 
until [CITV has broadcast it)." 
"You can certainly run that quote," 
CITV managing partner Darren Manko­
vich says of Davies's rant, "but I can't 
confirm or deny anything [about the 
Queer as Folk deal)." According to 
Mankovich , the Miami-based CITV is a 
start-up network that plans to offer pro­
gramming via "multiple distribution 
strategies for cable and satellite," al­
though no firm outlets have yet been ~</p>
<p>announced. So when and where Queer 
aB Folk might SUIface on US. television 
or video remains hazy. "That's driving 
everyone crazy," says Davies. "Strangely 
enough, and by complete accident, I 
think that's one of the things that's mak­
ing it even more of a cult." 
The original eight-episode miniseries 
from 1999 is far from just a cult in the 
United Kingdom. It was Channel Four's 
second-high est-rated series (behind 
E.R), the video release was the channel's 
best-selling video ever, and there are two 
separate UK. sound track albums. But 
the massive attention the first episodes 
garnered meant that the sequel-two 
one-hour episodes that aired on Channel 
Four in February a week apart-would 
almost inevitably disappoint. 
"So many people hated it," says 
Davies, talking about the show's most 
dedicated UK. fans. "We got letters in 
the office saying, 'His hair has 
changed.' They were too close to it." 
Critical reaction, however, ''was stag­
geringly better," says Davies, who's as 
unassuming as a 6-foot 6-inch Welsh­
man can be. He talks just as enthusiasti­
cally about his early work in children's 
TV (a series about computer geeks star­
ring a 16-year-old Kate Winslet) and the 
notoriously bad soap Revelations. 
But Queer aB Folk is still a passion 
for Davies. A torrid soap, the series cen­
ters on sweet, hapless 29-year-old 
Vince, who pines for his best pal, Stuart; 
15-year-old Nathan, who also burns for 
Stu (and allows Stu to seduce him in the 
series' steamy first episode); and bad 
boy Stuart, who's turning 30, looking for 
the next shag, and thinking he has it all 
together-yet didn't even come out to 
his parents until the sequel. 
Despite the ego-boosting attention all 
the actors got, filming the final two 
hours went swimmingly, although 
Davies admits they were a bit worried 
about 19-year-old Charlie Hunnam, who 
plays controversy-magnet Nathan. Hun­
nam had, after all, gone to America, 
been courted by everyone, and even 
met Madonna 
"I was almost slightly dreading him 
coming back," says Davies. "But [the at­
tention] just humbled him and made 
him grow up. He'd gone and studied act­
ing in greater detail than he'd ever done 
before. And I think it showed. His per­
formance was a thousand times 
stronger in the sequel. I love him for that</p>
<p>because I would have b"en too busy 
going to parties and getting pissed and 
doing cocaine and things like that at that 
age. He's very clever. 's got success 
written all over rum. N0. Juccess; that's 
PHOTOS COURTESY CHANNEl FOUR not the right word. Spe­
cial." Indeed, Hun­
nam's name has joined 
Leonardo DiCaprio's 
among those bandied 
about to play teenage 
Darth Vader in Star 
Wars: Episode II, 
scheduled to begin 
filming this sununer. 
Everything has not 
gone so swimmingly 
for Davies. Take his 
parents, for example. 
They always took pride 
in his TV work, and 
when Davies wrote for 
The Grand, a sort of 
Upstairs, Downstairs 
set in a hotel, his mum 
could bask in the ap­
preciative comments of 
her friends. But during 
the initial run of Queer 
as Folk, as she celebrat­
ed her 70th birthday, 
some people stayed 
away from her party 
because they thought 
Davies might be there. 
"Worse, I gave her a 
tape of the first episode 
[before it aired]," re­
members Davies. "She 
gave it back to me and said, 'This is 
pornography.'" (His parents have since 
made peace with the show, he notes.) 
More recently, Davies hit a brick wall 
with Channel Four. He had worked on a 
much-ballyhooed Queer as Folk spin-off 
called Misfits, charting out some 20 
episodes and writing the first two. "I 
can write some rubbish," he says, "but 
these were fab." Davies says Channel 
Four, astonishingly, took a pass. 
"We'll never really know what hap­
pened," he says. "I was livid. But now I'm 
really, really happy because there's clo­
sure. To be honest, I'm glad it's over.".
