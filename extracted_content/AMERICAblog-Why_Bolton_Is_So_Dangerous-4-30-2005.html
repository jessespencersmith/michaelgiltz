4/30/2005 04:30:00 PMWe've been saying for a while that what's disturbing aboutBolton for the UN is not some stupid, "boss from Hell"reputation (though that hardly bodes well for an ambassador).The specific charges of harassment and intimidation are moreserious than that. But the real concern is over Bolton's attemptto twist intelligence for political purposes -- the very crime thatBush, Rice, Cheney et al committed over Iraq.The LA Times makes this connection and nails why Bush wantsBolton so bad:The soap opera hearings over the president's nomination ofJohn Bolton as U.N. ambassador have had an unintendedeffect, bolstering what half a dozen investigations ofpre-9/11 intelligence failures couldn't prove: an atmospherein the White House that pushed spies to bend theirconclusions to political ends....Bolton, an assistant secretary of State, was subject to thecaution and apparent personal dislike of then-Secretary ofState Colin L. Powell. Had he been speaking for DefenseSecretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, or on behalf of VicePresident Dick Cheney, the pressure would probably havebeen more successful.The most important piece of the puzzle, though, is theWhite House's strong defense of Bolton. "[H]e is someonewho has a long record of results in getting things done,"said a presidential spokesman last week. "And sometimesyou get people mad at you when you get things done. Butwe believe he's a very capable individual and will do anoutstanding job at the United Nations."All three sentences praise Bolton's style and record. Thatmeans behavior like Bolton's must be regarded as not justnormal but desirable by the White House. Cheney made asimilar defense earlier this week.Behaving like a boor and a bully is not so rare ingovernment. Using threats to twist the conclusions ofcareer intelligence analysts ought to be. But if Bolton is soadmired in the house where the buck stops, it is impossibleto believe that he's the only practitioner.
