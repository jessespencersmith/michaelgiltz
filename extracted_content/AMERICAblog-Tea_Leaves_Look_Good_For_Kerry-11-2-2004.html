11/02/2004 08:18:00 PMWatching ABC News, all the subtle signs point to a Kerry victory. TheKerry camp is excited and confident; the Bush camp is defensive andtalking a good talk but conceding it's really, really close. As we allknow, the people in the media know a lot more about the polling datastreaming in from all over the country than they can let on until thepolls close. From the way they're presenting stories and pressingcertain points, they seem to be laying the groundwork for a Kerryvictory. Sure, this is like examining the photos of the Politburo forclues as to who is in and who is out, but it's still telling. How is thetea-leaf reading on the other networks?UPDATE: Republican Gov. George Pataki walks into a "victory party"(the R candidate will be crushed by Chuck Schumer for Senate) andhow does he start? By saying, "Regardless of who wins..." That's thetheme of the Republicans tonight: it's very close and "regardless ofwho wins." Peter Jennings begins an interview with attack dog RudyGuiliani by saying Rudy has been the most partisan attacker of Kerryand does he want to be a little more conciliatory tonight? Oops, morestate voting booths closing, gotta go.
