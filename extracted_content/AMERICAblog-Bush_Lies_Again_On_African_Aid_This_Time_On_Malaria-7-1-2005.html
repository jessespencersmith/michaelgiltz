7/01/2005 07:06:00 PMBush announced $1.2 billion in aid to Africa to fight malaria.Sounds great, just like that $15 billion he promised to spend infighting AIDS (and then didn't).But look closer and you'll realize Bush isn't announcing $1.2billion in NEW funding, heaven forfend. No, despite the entireworld focusing on Africa and trying to take radical steps toattack that continent's problems with a combination of targeteddebt relief, increased aid and fair trade practices; despite ourclosest ally Britain begging Bush to step up to the plate at thishistoric moment; despite the obvious benefits of proving to theMuslim world Bush doesn't just want to bomb countries butgenuinely wants to help, Bush says NO.All Bush is doing is moving money around from one part of thebudget to another, a shell game, really, to trick people intothinking he's being proactive and caring.This dodge reached its obscene peak in Darfur, where Bushmoved in funds to feed the starving children in that war-tornarea ravaged by genocide. But how did Bush feed those kids?By moving funding away from other regions of the Sudan andfocusing on Darfur because that's where the world waswatching. Quite literally, he took food out of the mouths of littlechildren to feed other children farther away and called ithumanitarian relief.Now he's doing the same thing with malaria funding. Whatwould Jesus do? Give until it hurts or, like Bush, hurt untilpeople give in?
