After a series of setbacks,
Laura Benantins back
on Broadway BY MTcrrAr,L erurz
ell actress Laura Benanti that her career on Broad-
way is filled with backstage drama and she responds,
"Which drama are you talking about?" It's been that
ii...\ type of career.
$,. There's the drama of the dangerous fall Benanti took
,ii,l during the 2002 reivalof "Into the Woods" that broke
her neck. Then there's the added drama of that dangerous condi-
tion being misdiagnosed. Benanti spent nine months doing phys-
ical therapy and wondering why she wasn't getting better - only
to find out she was one jostle on the subway away from becoming
paralyzed fbr life.
Then there's the tlme she olfered to
stcp awfly irom Riclrard Creenberg s 'l he
Violet Hour'' in 2003 because it "didn't
feel right'- and having her ofler accept-
ed by the pr oducer s, only to have some
Bossip peddlers report she was l'irecl and
c0uldn't act
Not to mention her having to take med-
ical leave I ronr t he tsroadway musical
"The W'edding Singer" for six weeks
in2006-andthenretrrrningt0 j
the show almost the lninute
lhey anrrounced it would be
clOslng
"l'm grateful," says Bena-
nti, who is now starring in a
Broadway revival of "Ciyp-
sv," opening Thursdalr at the
St James Theater Benanti
plays the tomboyish Louise, who
transforrns into the world-famous
stripper, opposite Patti LuPone as the fe-
roci0us stage mom Rose
"l'm not glad I broke my neck, but it did
inform me Had I experienced all these
wonderful blessings and fortunate experi-
ences, I don't know if I would have appre-
ciated them as much if I hadn't had some
of the crap on the other side "
For every setback, Benanti has definite-
ly enjoyed a timely break She was once
fejected as being too adult to play Liesl in
a revival of "The Sound of Music " But di-
rector Susan Schulman saw somethingand made her the understudy for Rebecca
I Luker's Maria Itledto Benanti's Broad-
i way debut at I 9 when Luker left the show,
: and that resulted in Tony-nominated txrns
i in "Swingl" in 1999 and "Into the Woods,"
i as Cinderella
Another break came when Benanti's
fdend, actress Maly Stuart Masterson,
insisted she go to a doctor for a second
opinion about that lingering neck
iniuN while Benanti was in the
midst of rehearsals for the mu-
sical "Nine " Benanti had to
schedule surgery immediate-
ly, and thr ough tears told the
show's creative team that
she'd have to leave the cast
"They said, 'We'll wait
for you,"' says Benanti, even
though she wouldn't be avail-
able until the first performance
"Who does that? That's amazing "
And despite winning a major role as
Jonny Lee Mi.ller's love interest on the
new ABC drama "Eli Stone," the show's
creators allowed her to scale back her
workload from six episodes to three so
she could be in "Gypsy" with LuPone
It allowed Benanti to tackle a juicy
role in one of the most acclaimed musi-
cals of all time - a character who suffers
through almost as much backstage drama
as Benanti has
"Her loneliness really touches me."
says Benanti about Louise "Her desire
and want for her mother's love. and how
sad it is that she ultimately receives that
love through an audience who's watching
her take off her clothes
"She has to change, she has to harden
in order to live in the wor [d that she's cre-
ated for herself She created Glpsy Rose
Lee: she made her But she didn't start out
that wav" aNl
