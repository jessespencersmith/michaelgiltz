'War' • crimes 
British detective 
tackles WWII cases 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
THE British mystery series "Foyle's 
War" -which shows police investi­
gating crimes during World War II -
is enjoying its second season on u.s. tele­
vision with a series of four two-hour 
movies. "Among [he Few." the second of 
them. is a corker set in 1940 in which 
thieves filch precious fuel from the local 
depot and Foyle's son, Andrew, finds him­
self embroiled in a scandal in the RAE 
A smash hit in the UK, "Foyle's War" has a 
properly upstanding detective in Christo­
pher Foyle (Michael Kitchen), but little else 
about the show is predictable. 
"Setting a detective series in the second 
World War was like opening Pandora's 
Box," says creator Anthony Horowitz, 
whose wife, Jill Green, is one of the show's 
producers , "Everyw here we looked there's 
a great story." 
Indeed, the show depicts the war's 
demoralizing effect on the British. We see 
citizens wailing during a bombing strike, 
attacks on stores owned by Italians and 
even English businessmen trying to 
arrange secret deals with the Third Reich. 
"Everything we put into 'Foyle's War' is 
true, with the exception of the murders that 
[provide] the stories," says Horowitz, 4~. 
"One of our frustrations is how little peo­
ple realize that to be the case." 
One of the most memorable aspects of 
the show are the characters themselves, 
from Foyle (named after a famed London 
bookshop) to his female driver, Sam 
(played by the wonderfully named Honey­
suckle Weeks), and the wounded veteran 
Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), who has 
lost a leg and bas been recruited by Foyle to 
help him solve crimes. 
"Having a personal involvement gives 
Milner a passionate drive tbat neither 
Foyle nor Sam bave," says Howell, 33."He's 
fighting a war that he was part of." 
And, of course, war seems like a distant 
threat compared to the byways of fictional 
England where, thanks to writers such as 
Agatha Christie and Horowitz, so many 
towns like the one in "Foyle's War" seem to 
have an inordinate amount of murders , 
"New York is probably a mucb safer place 
to live," says Horowitz , with a laugh. "If 
you're going to live ill La place like] Oxford 
or Hastings, you're probably a goner."
