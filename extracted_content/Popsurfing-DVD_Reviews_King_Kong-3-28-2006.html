            <p>T U E S D AY,  M A R C H  2 8 ,  2 0 0 6DVD Reviews: King Kong and MoreCheck out my latest NY Post DVD column to see reviews of DVDscoming out today. Among the titles covered: a crazily complete Planetof the Apes boxed set, The New York Mets 1986 World Series and aCriterion collection of three Louis Malle gems. And here's the reviewthat was cut: Peter Jackson's King Kong.King Kong Special Edition** ½(Universal; $30.98)Unnecessary. That’s the final verdict on director Peter Jackson’selaborate remake. The prologue is drawn out, the thrills on Skull Islandare overblown and would any sensible gal wear high heels on the top ofthe Empire State Building? Still, Naomi Watts and Andy Serkis as Konghave a real rapport, which saves this from disaster. The extra half a staris for voluminous extras, including a video diary and much, muchmore. ADD: If I'd had more room, I would have also pointed out theirony that the natives on Skull Island are presented in a far more racistmanner in the 2005 version than in the 1933 original. Sure, the originalhas a shot or two of bug-eyed natives, not to mention women wearingcoconut bras over their breasts. But the natives are sober and have acertain dignity. When the film crew shows up on their island in themiddle of a ceremony, they simply ask them to leave. Their sacrifice toKong doesn't seem to give them any pleasure. In the Peter Jacksonversion, the natives are savage and living in feral misery, viciouslyattacking the camera crew when they show up and taking orgiastic gleein sacrificing the blond girl to their god. I'd say it was a definite stepbackwards.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
