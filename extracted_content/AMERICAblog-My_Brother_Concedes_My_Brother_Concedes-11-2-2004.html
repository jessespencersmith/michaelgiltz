11/02/2004 07:54:00 PMAt least a little. My brother in Pennsylvania -- who abstained fromvoting in that swing state after endless hectoring from me (he agreednot to vote for Bush but wasn't about to vote FOR Kerry and hey I'lltake it) -- my brother has just conceded...well, not the election. Buthe's said for the first time that he believes Kerry might very well win.I was chided for expressing any butterflies on election eve (eventhough I used it as an excuse to exhort people to vote, vote, vote).But now that's it's election night and seeing the massive turnout, Ifeel very excited and positive. So who's cracking now?Any stories out there about ardent Bush supporters -- family orfriends --who are now suddenly very, very nervous?
