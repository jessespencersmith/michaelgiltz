8/24/2004 02:34:00 AMYep, the Army investigated itself and couldn't help uncovering furtherdamning details at Abu Ghraib. Among the most pathetic: soldierstorturing kids by having contests in which they frightened the hell outof young teenagers with attack dogs. The winner? The one who madea kid urinate on himself first."It has nothing to do with interrogation," said one Army officerfamiliar with the report. "It was just them on their own being weird."And the report includes further confirmation of rape.So, with details including the sadistic treatment of kids and warcrimes like rape, this Army report must have called for some prettyheavy penalties, right? Wrong."Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, then the top U.S. commander in Iraq, isnamed in the report for leadership deficiencies and failing to deal withrising problems at the prison as he tried to manage 150,000 troopscountering an unexpected insurgency. Sanchez, however, will not berecommended for any punitive action or even a letter of reprimand."
