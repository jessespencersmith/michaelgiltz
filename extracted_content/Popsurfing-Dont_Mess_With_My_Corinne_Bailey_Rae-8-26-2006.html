            <p>S AT U R D AY,  A U G U S T  2 6 ,  2 0 0 6Don't Mess With My Corinne Bailey RaeThe New York Times featured a rather condescending review ofCorinne Bailey Rae's concert at Webster Hall -- the one I raved aboutso you KNOW the NYT is wrong. It managed to be polite, whiledescribing her as performing with "an unlikely confidence" and takingher to task for having a "refined" backstory.Ms. Rae’s lush, slightly folky soul-pop does not offer any reallyrical insights or musical innovations, but that is the point: likeNorah Jones and Sade, she is all about setting a pleasant,vaguely searching mood.While some might dismiss Jones and Sade as aural wallpaper, the factis that they are both hugely acclaimed. It's like dismissing a rocker bycomparing him to Bruce Springsteen and John Mellencamp. Shouldn'tyou start by explaining why THEY'RE not any good? As a kicker, thereviewer says that for those who might still care about authenticity(personally, I just care about good music, however "authentic" or "fake"it might be) Rae writes "some of her own music." Actually, she only hasone album and Rae wrote or cowrote every song on it. Thanks forimplying she's a puppet and taking a dig at one of the most refreshingalbums of the year. And frankly, her live performance makes clear Raehasn't even scratched the surface of her talents. Yet.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
