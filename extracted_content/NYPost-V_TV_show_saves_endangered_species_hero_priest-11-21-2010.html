The sci-fi series " V" -- which returns in early January -- offers one
of the rarest sights on TV: a heroic priest.
Priests on TV are, these days, child molesters or behind-the-collar schemers. It's only natural
considering recent headlines.
But "V" having a heroic priest a as one of its main characters? That makes Father Jack Landry
practically one of kind in prime time.
The novelty is not lost on Joel Gretsch, the actor who plays Father Landry.
"I grew up in a small town in Minnesota," says Gretsch, "and there was a seminary -- the biggest
one in the country -- about six miles from there. I'd go to leadership camp there every summer.
"I was around a lot of priests who werevery influential in my life in an
extraordinary way."
"V" is a remake of the popular, 1983
miniseries about a fleet of alien space
ships that appear one day over the
major cities of the world. The "Visitors,"
as the aliens call themselves, promisetheir intent is peaceful and that they only
want to help humanity.
But a few humans learn early on that the
Visitors are not what they claim to be.
In the opening moment of the new
series -- which switched from NBC to
ABC in the intervening 27 years --
people are shown flocking to their
houses of worship. In times of fear andconfusion, naturally people turn to faith.
That's where the novelty of the Father
Jack character -- who was not in the
original -- comes in, because the priest
is one of the few who realize the Vistorsare up to no good.

"Father Jack can't be, 'Okay, let's just
hold hands and pray,' " says Gretsch.
"He knows, 'I have to do something. Ihave to do stuff, and people are going
to possibly get hurt. We're in a war, and
when you go to war there are going tobe casualties.' "
The priest cannot go public with his
knowledge about the aliens, so he joinsa group of insurgents -- including a long-
sought-after terrorist and an alien
defector -- to wage guerilla war.
Gretsch -- who was raised Catholic and is married with two children to William Shatner's daughter
-- is ready for a flesh-and-blood man of the cloth who fights the aliens, agonizes over "collateral
damage" and, yes, finds his faith tested by a growing bond with beautiful FBI agent Erica Evans(Elizabeth Mitchell).
The 46-year-old actor is glad the show didn't take the obvious route where "the collar comes flying
off," as he put it.
His priestly "naivete and trying to look at the good of people" are weaknesses the stunning alien
leader, Anna, will try to exploit this season, Gretsch says.
But don't be surprised to see the attraction between Father Jack and Evans become even more
noticeable when the 10 episode-run of Season 2 begins in January. (Season 1 of the series just
came out on DVD.)
"Throughout this second season, you're going to see that struggle in many ways," he says.
