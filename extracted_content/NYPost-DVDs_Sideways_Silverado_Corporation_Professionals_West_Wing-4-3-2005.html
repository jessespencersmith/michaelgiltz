Q) z Sideways **** Fox, $29.98 
Every bit as good as the critics said, this winning movie 
about two buddies on a wine-tasting trip is full-bodied and 
rich in humor and hopefulness, with just a hint of cynicism to 
keep you on your toes. Extras include deleted scenes and com足
mentary by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church. Also 
just out is Adam Sandler's "Spanglish" (Sony. $28.95), which is 
every bit as bad as the critics said. 
Silverado: Gift Set ***llz Sony, $19.94 
This 1985 Western helped 
turn Kevin Costner into a star 
and was so much fun, you just 
knew it would be followed by a 
revival of the genre. Nope, but 
at least we've still got this 
quirky gem that also stars 
Kevin Kline, Danny Glover and 
John Cleese. Lots of extras, 
including playing cards, com足
mentary by Western historians 
and more. 
The ~Corporation ** Zeitgeist, $29.99 
This engaging documentary 
takes a long time to come to the 
conclusion that corporations are 
concerned with only one thing: 
money. Its amusing twist is to 
treat a corporation like a "per足
son" (its legal defInition) and 
decide that based on its actions, 
it must be a psychopath. 
Interviews with everyone from 
Milton Friedman to Noam 
Chomsky. 
The Professionals: 
S~Edition *** Sony, $19.94 
Anyone suffering withdrawal 
after the end of Film Forum's 
terrifIc Western series in March 
should pick up this precursor to 
"The Dirty Dozen." The 1966 
Burt Lancaster romp about men 
hired to rescue a rich man's wife from a revolutionary 
Mexican is unpretentious fun. 
Also out: Barbara Stanwyck and 
Edward G. Robinson are a mar足
ried couple looking to tame the 
West in 1955's "The Violent 
Men" (Sony, $14.94). 
The West Wing: 
Season Four *** Warner Bros., $59.98 
Aaron Sorkin was dumped by 
NBC after this season, so not 
surprisingly, it's the last one 
worth watching. President 
Bartlett's reelection provides a 
lot of fodder, as does Sam 
Seaborn's run for Congress. (In 
an ironic twist, Rob Lowe was 
treated just as poorly by Sorkin 
as Sorkin was by NBC, but left 
gracefully on his own.) 
Unfortunately, the show would 
never be the same. Also out: 
"Queer as Folk: Fourth Season." 
(Showtime, $109.98).</p>
