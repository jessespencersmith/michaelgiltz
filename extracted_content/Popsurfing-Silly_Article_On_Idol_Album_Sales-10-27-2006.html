            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  O C TO B E R  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6Silly Article On "Idol" Album SalesUSA Today does an article on CD sales of "Idol" alumni. They're"slowing." Example number one: the THIRD album by RuebnStuddard. Think about that for a moment: winning or even appearingon "American Idol" can hardly be expected to give you a never-endingcareer. It's remarkable how MANY people from "Idol" have actuallybeen able to launch their debut solo albums. Is it really a sign of failurethat not every artist will have a lengthy career? Of course not. KellyClarkson has proved you CAN have a meaningful career launching from"Idol." And Studdard may too: his third album has received betterreviews than his first two. Carrie Underwood is a smash in country withher debut. Josh Gracin has enjoyed a string of country hits. Clay Aikenhad a smash debut and a solid Christmas album -- his third album isdoing poorly and Aiken has complained he wanted to do originals butwas forced to do an album of covers. Fantasia had a string of R&B hits.Jennifer Hudson is starring in the potential smash musical"Dreamgirls," widely picked to be an Oscar favorite. I could go on andon. To suggest that "Idol" is losing steam because everyone associatedwith it isn't having a long-term career is silly. More to the point, aremarkable number of them ARE building careers. And the same weekRuben's new album premiered, Diddy's new album hit #1 -- but at least300,000 copies lower than his last album. CD sales are down in generalright now. But you can't blame Diddy on "Idol."POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
