MOVIES: A "Close Encounter" With A Steven
Spielberg/John Williams Classic
THE  ART  OF  THE  SCORE:  NEW  YORK  PHILHARMONIC
CLOSE  ENCOUNTERS  OF  THE  THIRD  KIND  *** 1/2
CONDUCTOR: RICHARD KAUFMAN
DAVID GEFFEN HALL AT LINCOLN CENTER
Director Steven Spielberg has made about 32 feature films. (I'm
counting his upcoming remake of West  Side  Story .) But one of them is
unique. 1977's Close  Encounters  of  The  Third  Kind  is the only film
solely written and directed by Spielberg and Spielberg alone. And if
he'd made it after he was married and had kids, Spielberg says he
would never have ended it quite the way he did.
Thank God he wasn't a dad yet. CET3K  is disturbing, obsessive, mildly
bewildering, adult and startlingly spare and abrupt. It's also awe-
inspiring and very convincing in delivering the close encounter with
aliens the title promises. This movie is far less of a thrill ride thanRaiders  and not remotely the heart-tugger of E.T.   It's longer than you
remember, stranger than you think, more upsetting than you expectand not nearly so joyous as you want. In it, a man goes nearly insane,
destroys his home life and then knowingly and intentionally abandons
his family, probably forever. Yet in 1977 it saved Columbia Picturesand became that studio's biggest hit of all time.
I have a friend who was traumatized by it when her parents took her
to the film at a far-too-young age. In many ways, Jaws  is a lot less
scary. In Jaws , the danger is a monster you can understand -- a beast
of the deep doing what it was made to do: swim and eat. In CET3K ,
the monster is within: it's the madness in your brain, the once-loving
father in your home. It is Spielberg's most personal film.
And in the same year composer John Williams revived the film score
with the all-time blockbuster, Wagnerian triumph that was the music
of Star  Wars  (an even bigger hit at the box office), he also deliveredMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

SHOWBIZ SANDBOX #463:
Why Is A TV Special</p>
<p>astringent eerie work for CET3K . It contains one of his most famous,
iconic and widely parodied themes (the five note "doorbell" that serves
as a hello between humanity and aliens) and yet it's also one of his
least appreciated scores.
That ends now thanks to the New York premiere of the full score
conducted by Richard Kaufman, performed by the New York
Philharmonic and the Musica Sacra chorus, all accompanying a print
of Spielberg's preferred cut of the film. If you're lucky enough to be inthe city, head to Lincoln Center and snap up any remaining tickets forThursday, September 12.  Even better, grab tickets as well for The Art
Of The Score's performance of Bernard Herrmann's innovative, all-strings work on Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho . Those performances take
place September 13th and 14th.
It's great to see the diverse audience attending these performances.
Many are clearly fans of the movie while some are regular attendees of
the Philharmonic season venturing into less familiar territory. To
make a case for the music of John Williams, you might be tempted tojust deliver a pops concert with one of his scores arranged anew. Andwhy not? The music can stand on its own. But just as rock lyrics aren'tpoetry, a film score isn't really a symphony. Yes, you can read BobDylan's lyrics on their own, but to fully appreciate them you must
listen to the songs. The music of John Williams can be complex and
challenging and certainly as satisfying as any symphony unafraid to betuneful. But a score is best heard and appreciated in context: with aprojection of the film. And The Art Of The Score series allows you to do
that in an ideal setting, with the film beautifully projected but the
score invariably dominating your attention thanks to a liveperformance.
Close  Encounters  of  the  Third  Kind  is curiously overlooked in
Spielberg's career. Jaws  looms large as his first breakthrough and of
course E.T.  and Raiders  are all time entertainments alongside it. His

<p>Spielberg seriously, began with The  Color  Purple,  flourished with
Empire  of  the  Sun  (perhaps his peak as a director) and achieved the
desired dream via the Oscar-winning movies  Schindler's  List  and
Saving  Private  Ryan.  Spielberg was all grown up, unfortunately, and
rarely made a great film again (except when he forgot himself and
delivered the pure entertainment of  Catch  Me  If  You  Can,  the last
movie worthy of him). Yet way back towards the start, when Jaws  was
a monster hit that let Spielberg write his own ticket, he wrote anddirected CET3K,  a harrowing look at the disintegration of a family that
makes no apologies and doesn't even pretend to comfort at the end.
The film's dramatic weight struck me when seeing the film in theaters
during its 30th anniversary release. Now with the essential Art Of TheScore series, for the first time I appreciated that John Williams is just
as bold as the director. In Star  Wars,  he delivers rousing themes by
the yard. In this film, he jolts you at the start and then gets under your
skin with skittering cues that don't resolve themselves. They tantalize,they tease, but they never quite say "be scared" or "be excited" or "beworried." They unsettle you. The choral work of Musica Sacra wasespecially striking since I barely realized there WAS any vocal work in
the score the previous five or ten times I've seen the film.
Heck, I barely remembered anything about the score except for the
climactic scene where first contact is initiated with a five note "hello"
played by humans and repeated by alien craft. That back-and-forth
game of Simon Says was captured to perfection by the electronic toySimon  (introduced in 1978). In my mind, I remembered the entire
finale as just a synth-fest of some sort.
Far from it. The philharmonic had long passages throughout the first
half of the film where they were at rest. CET3K  isn't the marathon of a
performance that Star  Wars  proved in their triumphant rendition of
that score. When intermission ended and they stretched out with somefull-bodied themes before the film proper started up again, I thoughtit a welcome chance to let them strut their stuff since the score was
more discreet than usual for Williams. Well, it turns out the beautifully
paced climactic scene features the full orchestra. My memory of asynth-fest in fact begins with a woodwind (I think!) duetting with atuba. The small voice of humanity and the booming sound of aliensare actually playful and warm and soon more and more instruments
join in. It's positively delightful and a release to hear the melody
hinted at throughout the film receiving its due.
Earlier in the movie, a little boy is abducted by aliens. (It's the scene
you see in the trailer where the child is opening a door while a fiery
but enticing red light comes bursting in. Spielberg says that may bethe defining image of his career and I'd agree.) It's scary but becausethe little boy isn't really frightened at any point, we instinctively knowthe aliens won't hurt him. Little children and puppies are invariably
good predictors of danger in movies: if they look nervous or growl, you
should be nervous too.</p>
<p>In the same way, the score that unnerves us throughout, the five note
melody that pops up here and there but never gets resolved in a
musical fashion finally bursts out at the finale. The orchestral interplayduring that triumphant meeting of humanity and alien life isoverwhelming and heart-stopping. But because it's told through thevoice of the orchestra rather than synthesizers (as I always imagined)
the audience knows this is a conversation, a dialogue. The tuba makes
you smile. Yes, the interplay is frantic and a little confusing, but it'smessy and human (or should I say humane?), a meeting of mindsrather than a clashing of cultures. And Williams told us all that with
his score alone.
At the end, conductor Richard Kaufman pointed out individual
musicians and sections of the philharmonic one by one, calling onthem to take a bow. But of course it was John Williams who stoodtallest. He wrote and experimented with hundreds of different fivenote themes, searching for the perfect combination that would satisfy
Spielberg and allow Williams to undergird two hours of film with
music that never called undue attention to itself. He succeeded. Again.The result is one of his most innovative and least appreciated scores,just as Close  Encounters  Of  The  Third  Kind  is one of Spielberg's most
mature, least appreciated major films.
