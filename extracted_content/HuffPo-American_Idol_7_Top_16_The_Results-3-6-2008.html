American Idol  Top 16: The Results
Posted March 6, 2008 | 10:46 PM (EST)

Four say goodbye and we name the Top 12. But not before last season's runner-up Blake Lewis
performs his new single "How Many Words." Nice dance moves but not a great vocal. I think five ofthe performances this week would make stronger singles. But in defense of last season's finalists:Blake's album is easily one of the best reviewed debut albums by an Idol  alum (only Carrie
Underwood's blockbuster was received better). And while people dismissed Jordin Sparks as justteen fluff, who's that I see with two hit singles at the moment ("Tattoo" and "No Air" with ChrisBrown)? Yep, Jordin Sparks.
David Cook, David Archuleta and Jason Castro all took seats in the Top 12. Does this, I wonder,
track with the number of votes they got? I wouldn't be surprised if they were this week's top threevote getters among the men. For the gals, Brooke White (singer-songwriter, Brooke; think "singer-songwriter!") and my crush Syesha Mercado made it through. I find it hard to believe Syesha wasin the top two of vote getters but I'd like to think so. They gave each other a half-hearted hug.Brooke is all sweetness and light but I think she's gunning for the finals. Brooke don't messaround.
Kady Malloy  -- Nodding her head because she knew
she was going home. My first pick and I was right.
Asia'h Epperson burst into tears even before Kady
gave a dreadful, off-key rendition of Queen's "Who
Wants To Live Forever." No final insult from thejudges, which was nice, though someone could have
said, "You're an entertainer; not a singer." Take acting lessons, try out for sketch shows, Kady. Agroup hug from the gals at the end, which did NOT include Brooke or Syesha. Hey, once you're inthe Top 12 you do not want to give up that seat.
David Hernandez must have been nervous since the first gal was eliminated. But David sported
military tags (a leftover from his days as an adult entertainer, one couldn't help wondering?) andsailed through. Michael Johns also made it. I should have been smarter and realized he was safe:when all three judges anoint you as going through to the next round, it's very very rare that

Luke Menard  -- All three judges did not anoint Luke, who was sent home. He was very composed
and seemed to know his number was up. At the very least, he can switch from his job of carpet
cleaning to a little runway work. Paula said some nice things, of course. All night long she told
every single person going home that they were going to be a great, big beautiful shining star. Your
appreciation for her kind words dims a little when you hear her saying it to the janitor, the
chauffeur, the doorman, and on and on.
Ramielle Malubay was safe and got a hug and gentle pat from Danny. Both he and Chikezie were
on the spot, but he was still able to applaud her. Nice kid. Carly Smithson and Amanda Overmyerwere also safe. That left a showdown between...
Asia'h Epperson v. Kristy Lee Cook  -- I had picked Asia'h to go and I was right. Kristy gave a
very nice distinctive, fresh performance of a classic tune. (And Middle America loves country; I
was wrong by the way -- listening to the song again she gave it more than a little twang than I firstthought). Ryan said, "I'm going to give you the choice" again when it came time for her to sing.Ryan, they always have a choice. What are you going to do? Kick her off the show if she refuses?She did a fine job with Paula yelling out that it was her best vocal yet. Danny and Chikezie clappeddutifully along though they looked like they were at a funeral.
Danny v. Chikezie -- Chikezie took Danny's hand and held it as they walked to the center of the
stage and then put his arm around Danny while Ryan spoke. Ramiele is crying because Dannylooks upset. Then Chikezie nodded his head because he just knew he was the one going home. Hedoes this every time and every time he's safe. Chikezie has to start believing in himself. Danny issent home and now he starts crying and Ramiele is crying and he and Chikezie have a big long hugand Chikezie doesn't seem to want to let go and his parents are seen giving thanks to God for hiswin. Danny was totally bummed about not making it because he knows getting into the Top 12means the tour and immortality of a sort that just missing the Top 12 does NOT get you. I'd felt hereached a tipping point of campiness with "Tainted Love" but wanted to believe one of the mostentertaining contestants had another week or two in him. Is America ready for an openly gay Idol ?
He gave a stronger vocal performance tonight, with David Hernandez clapping and pumping his
fists and dancing along. Good to see scandal hasn't inhibited him.
So Kady Malloy and Asia'h Epperson and Luke Menard and Danny Noriega are going home. I got
three of four right (I picked Michael Johns to go instead of Danny) so maybe I'm finally starting to
hit my stride a la Brooke White. Hope I haven't peaked too soon. Are you happy with the final 12and is David Archuleta still the moppet to beat or has HE peaked too soon?

Brooke: I wanted to dislike her, actually I do dislike her - I can't stand her smarmy I am sososososo
much better than you or any of your friends attitude. But got to give it to her, she is very very good. Ilove Amanda as well, but i fear she is a little too far from the mainstream to go deep into thecompetition. And I absolutely love Jason - reminds me of the street musicians I see at our publicmarket, very real very charming.

Love ya Michael, but AI does nothing for me.
Let's get into some other more interesting topics like the moves, TV shows(love New Amsterdam) and
things like that. Which you make so much more interesting than the usual critic. AI is just sort of a cult
thing IMHO.

Thanks for reading! I cover all my other interests at my own website (you can google it). But
since Idol is the number one show in the country and I'm gonna talk about it with friendsanyway, I figured why not post what I was already emailing? I'd gladly write about everythingfor free online but then I'd be even poorer than I am now. I spent almost two years bloggingabout entertainment and had to cut the cord because my actual paying freelance work wasdrying up. I've watched New Amsterdam and like the guy and all the old NYC trivia. BUt themysteries are lame. They threw in everything but the kitchen sink on the second episode: areveal of Amsterdam's son (which I loved) but then spoiling it by revealing a daughter in a
flashback, and a mystery that included auto-erotic asphyxiation and the date rape drug and
drug dealing AND sleeping with a teacher AND murdering a student AND murdering ahusband. Whew. What's left for next week? A cross-dressing serial killer who practices wicca,is an illegal immigrant and has a crystal meth lab?

Okay I'll give ya that one for the second episode. That was kind of overkill.
Did love the bit about the son AND the fact that he knows dad is immortal to a
degree.
Sorry I didn't realize you weren't a print critic with a fabulous paycheck and a
penthouse overlooking Central Park (and you should have).. That sucks cuz you are
better than any of the other critics of which I usually consider either total suckups by
praising EVERYTHING or are actual snobs who just don't get mainstream
entertainment but will spend pages praising something that is ultimately beyond the
kin of us mere mortals.
One almost can hear Jon Lovitz' voice.Still not a fan of AI. Just seems overblown hype, but like you said, it's the number
one show and I guess it's what people want to talk about. Jeez every morning showjust falls all over itself talking about it. Drives me crazy but I guess I'm in theminority.
BY the way , did you ever find that Samurai movie that was discussed several
weeks ago? One of the best ever.

Anyone who thinks Barack Obama's campaign is too cultish should check out how Paula, Randy andSimon look at David Archuleta. How long before they bring Sunjaya's crying little girl back for David?

Quite upset with results from this show. One of my favorites Asia'h (smokin hot) was eliminated. Sosorry to see her go, but I did think either her or Ramiele were going. She did give a great endingperformance considering the circumstances. And it seemed quite a number of the other contestantswere equally upset she was eliminated, I keep forgetting that alot of these folks are just kids and theybonded off set.Not surprised Kady was booted, she just didn't have it vocally to go forward.
As for the guys, no surprise Luke was eliminated but I did laugh with you noting he could have career
as a runway model, the dude was pretty buff. Maybe he should have gone to the tight shirt earlier to at
least get more of the female vote. All my female coworkers liked him. But the guy couldn't sing!
I was really shocked Danny got eliminated, too bad, he was pretty campy but at least he has a
personality (unlike David A, who I like, but just too rehearsed!) and he could do some witty reparteewith Simon. Glad Chizikie made it thru now, maybe he can relax a little and really show his stuff.And I gotta say David C has gone to the top of my list as favorites, loved his version of Hello. Bought iton Itunes and I even hum it at work! I hope he can give a stern challenge to the favorite, David A. Letshave an adult win AI this year!Plus also really glad David H got thru, he's a great singer and apparently most people agreed with methat the stripper affair was a big "so what?"

at LEAST that light-weight fem-bot Danny is finally off-the young female population could not relate to"Tainted Love" and with David in ; the gay pop can have a "MAN" in there for them! One blonde is stillin ,tho I 'm not sure why. And I do not mean Brooke )
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I don't think Danny was a contender but I did appreciate that he didn't try to butch himself upor pretend to be someone he's not -- and his repartee with Simon and Ryan and the rest wasdef a highlight the last few weeks.
