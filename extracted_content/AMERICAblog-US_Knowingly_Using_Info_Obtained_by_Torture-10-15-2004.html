10/15/2004 03:46:00 AMWho are Bush's best allies in the war on terror? Not Canada andMexico, our neighbors to the north and south. Not France andGermany, our allies for the past fifty years. Nope, Bush's closestbuddies are Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Pakistan, Lybia, Uzbekistanand the like.This makes a certain sense, since Saudi Arabia knows a lot aboutterror -- they practice it on their own people and spend their oilwealth spreading the virulent perversion of Islam called Wahhabismaround the world. Pakistan knows a lot about WMDs -- they've soldequipment and know-how to rogue nations and terrorist groups allover the world. Czar Putin of Russia has crushed the fragile newdemocracy in his homeland and brutalizes minorities he doesn't like.China uses the war on terror to justify its persecution of people inwacky cults like Falun Gong and the cultural genocide of the peace-loving Tibetans. Lybia is also a long-time terrorist state who harboredthe thugs that blew up a commercial US airliner.And then there's Uzbekistan. The UK just withdrew its ambassador.An outraged response to some Uzbeki impropriety? Just the opposite-- the outspoken ambassador who recognized the hypocrisy ofcollaborating in a war on terror with a govt like Uzbekistan hadbecome a political liability."Earlier this week, details were revealed of a furious memo[Ambassador Craig Murray] sent to the Foreign Office, complainingthat the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was using informationpassed on to it by the CIA but originally obtained in Uzbek torturecells," reports the Independent."As well as being morally and legally wrong, the practice wasunreliable because prisoners under torture could be expected to saywhatever their tormentors wanted to hear, he warned."And he wrote: "We are selling our souls for dross.""Murray created a stir in 2002 when he had the temerity to criticizethat country for the brutal conditions of its jails -- where twoprisoners were boiled to death.That's right, the US is knowingly using information obtained bytorture. What better way to fight the war on terror?You can tell a lot about someone by their friends. What dogovernments like these say about us?
