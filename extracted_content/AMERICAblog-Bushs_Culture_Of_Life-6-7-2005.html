6/07/2005 09:41:00 AMThe NYT columnist Nicholas Kristof chides Bush on Darfur --pointing out how even the tiniest gestures by Bush, how evenminimal troops from the African Union, have saved tens ofthousands of lives. The money quote:Mr. Bush values a frozen embryo. But he hasn't musteredmuch compassion for an entire population of terrorizedwidows and orphans. And he is cementing in place the veryhopelessness he dreads, by continuing to avert his eyesfrom the first genocide of the 21st century.Now thankfully the International Criminal Court will be investigatingthe claims of mass murder and widespread rape in Darfur -- one ofthe very tasks the UN is ideally suited for. Bush of course hates theICC and would normally block its involvement. But even he had toconcede this international body was the only one that made sense totake the lead on this case.But not blocking something is about as far as Bush will go to "help"Africa. He's rewarding his closest ally Tony Blair by spurning anyattempt to join the rest of the world on increasing aid to othercountries to match the generosity of other nations or tackling thegrowing crisis of climate change. Yep, Blair just admitted there's nopoint in talking to Bush about these issues. Thanks, George, fortrashing my legacy and showing that - with you -- loyalty is aone-way street.
