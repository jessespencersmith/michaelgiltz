8/24/2005 10:42:00 AMThe Bureau of Justice Statistics compiled a report that wouldsurprise no one -- certainly not minorities. Blacks, Hispanicsand whites are all stopped by traffic cops at about the samerate, but blacks and Hispanics are 2 to 3 times as likely to havetheir car searched, get a ticket, be threatened with force andso on.Of course, Bush hates facts so the head of the dept. LawrenceGreenfeld was pushed to make changes and downplay thisnews on racial profiling in a press release. He refused, wasthreatened with being fired and losing benefits and was finallydemoted. What else is new with Bush? Tell the truth, do yourjob -- get punished.Mr. Greenfeld refused to delete the racial references,arguing to his supervisors that the omissions would makethe public announcement incomplete and misleading.Instead, the Justice Department opted not to issue a newsrelease on the findings and posted the report online.Some statisticians said that decision all but assured thereport would get lost amid the avalanche of studies issuedby the government. A computer search of news articlesfound no mentions of the study.And the official who pushed him to delete that info? She got apromotion.
