<p>THE FALL OF LISA BELLOW by Susan Perabo
What would happen if you were just a kid in a deli and suddenly your nemesis in junior high school, Lisa 
Bellow, the popular girl who made fun of your weight once but otherwise hasn’t acknowledged your existence, comes in and it’s just the two of you and the deli man? There she is, the popular girl who has a boyfriend (a high schooler, no less!), the girl who you and your friends love to hate. What would you do if soon it was the four of you -- you, the mean girl, the deli guy and a man in a hoodie with a gun? When Lisa Bellow is taken at gunpoint by that man and Meredith Oliver remains frozen in place, head down on the floor where she is told to stay, you might expect the usual story of the police and community in hot pursuit
 
of the perpetrator and his victim. Not this time....  Read More.

<p>THE AMAZING STORY OF THE MAN WHO CYCLED FROM INDIA TO EUROPE FOR LOVE by Per J. 
Andersson
In this irresistible true story (part romance, part travelogue), a young man grows up poor in a small village 
in India, always holding fast to an absurd prophecy that predicts he will one day marry a woman from another country who is musical, owns a jungle and was born under the sign of an ox. It's improbable this man will ever even leave his village, but he makes it to art school in New Delhi and one day meets a young Swedish woman in a park named Lotta. They chat briefly and she must head back to Sweden. Of course, that's where this story begins.... Read More.

NEW YORK 2140 by Kim Stanley RobinsonKim Stanley Robinson is one of our boldest and most engaging writers of science fiction. Here he's 
headed to New York City after two catastrophically historic rises in sea levels have unintentionally turned Manhattan into a new and dangerous Venice. As with any good writer, Robinson creates vivid characters and stories that draw us in, from the police chief looking into the disappearance of two coders to the superintendent of a building constantly fighting off the threat of flooding to a Wall Street guy who might just get a little altruistic to woo a woman he likes. But as with the best of sci-fi writers dealing in hard science, Robinson has thoughtfully extrapolated what conditions science predicts in our near future with the ramifications of what that might mean for how people live and struggle and thrive. Human nature doesn't change and good writers like Robinson know that.They also know sci-fi can open our eyes to the possibilities (and threats) ahead while proving that people are always lusty and kind and greedy and scared and fascinating, no matter what world they live in.....

THE GULF by Jack E. DavisJack Davis -- a professor at the University Of Florida -- delivers a sweeping history of the Gulf of Mexico, 
stretching back thousands of years right up to the present. While the natural world and its evolving nature is a constant, needless to say the story is peopled with fascinating characters, from explorers and Presidents and wild-catters looking for oil to an architect from NYC who hooked a once-in-a-lifetime fish and the Tabasco king who dedicated his fortune to conservation. A wide-ranging and acclaimed environmental history of a uniquely American sea.... Read More.

<p>THE BOOK OF POLLY by Kathy Hepinstall
Southern eccentrics are a mainstay of colorful fiction, but they're a lot less fun when they're your mom. 
That's the dilemma of Willow, a ten year old girl who was clearly an unexpected "surprise" for her mother Polly, who had this  last child when in her late 50s. Oops. Willow was born late in her mother's life and has 
been trying to catch up ever since, even as her willfully antagonistic mother drives everyone else crazy in their tiny, boring Texas town. Willow spends her time trying to figure out what haunts her mother, who that long-lost beau Garland Jones was (and did he really kill a man), why're they're exiled from Polly's hometown of Bethel, Louisiana and can they escape the dreaded illness that stalks their family and may finally be coming for her mother?....

<p>MARTINA & CHRISSIE by Phil Bildner, illus by Brett Helquist
How often do we get to share a picture book about someone we know, people we've met? Not very often, 
of course! But this picture book about the tennis rivalry and personal friendship between Chrissie Evert and Martina Navratilova  is our big chance. We grew up playing tennis at the courts managed by Chrissie's 
dad, played Chrissie's little sister (and lost virtually every time) and as a ballboy watched these two legends first meet, play often and raise each other's games. It may be a stretch to call if "The Greatest Rivalry In The History Of Sports," but it's undoubtedly ONE of the greatest rivalries. The team behind it show their contrasting styles, how they made each other better and the respect they maintained even as their competition grew fiercer with each passing year.... Read More.

THE WANDERERS by Meg Howrey  
We've devoted ourselves to discovering the best new books every week. But there are SO many books in 
so many categories, even we sometimes play catch up. Here's what looks like one of the best literary sci-fibooks of the year, earning comparisons to the acclaimed blockbuster "Station Eleven." This one is about astronauts looking to endure isolation in a controlled simulation on Earth lasting a year and a half. The best
 
will be chosen for the first human mission to Mars. The author is a former ballet dancer (!) and has enjoyed success under the pen name Magnus Flyte. Now she's taking flight with what looks to be a breakout title, if
 
raves from trade papers, Amazon, fellow sci-fi writers and early reader reviews are any judge. We can't wait to lock ourselves in and read it fast.... Read More.</p>

THE CRISIS OF THE MIDDLE-CLASS CONSTIUTION by Ganesh SitaramanThis work by a protege of Senator Elizabeth Warren has three intriguing sections which don't quite mesh 
but provide a wealth of information. One, author Ganesh Sitaraman shows how philosophers and political theorists have always worried about inequality. Two, Sitaraman shows how the US has a system of government that ONLY works with a strong and indeed dominant middle class. For many reasons, the rich weren't too rich for a hundred years and  -- thanks to the Great Depression and WW II -- we had another three or four decades with everyone doing better. But that was a fluke, not the natural state of things in the
 
world. Now we face inequality and the richer some get, the more political power they get and thus the richer they get and the more powerful...you get the idea. In the final section, Sitaraman runs through the many examples of how inequality is perverting our government and politics and the culture in general and points to some prescriptive solutions....

<p>YVAIN: THE KNIGHT OF THE LION by M.T. Anderson, illus by Andrea Offermann
M.T. Anderson is a shape-shifter of a novelist, going from sci-fi to historical fiction to biography with ease.  
Now he leaps to comic books and the result is as satisfying as usual. Yvain is a reimagining of a tale of the  
Knights of the Round Table, as popularized in the epic poem by Chrétien de Troyes. In it, our questionably  
young hero goes on impulsive quests, behaves like a buffoon, berates himself for it and vows to do better, 
over and over again. On one level, it's a straightforward story about a bold knight who wins and woos his love after much trial and tribulation; on another level it very much calls into question all the chivalric nonsense surrounding brave men and the helpless women they rescue. The illustrations are by Andrea Offermann and this is a true collaboration. The artwork and the words are in constant tension, with the images often illuminating certain ideas or flatly contradicting the "official" action with a haunted look here and resigned misery there. Yvain is, frankly, a bit of an ass, especially when falling in love at first sight with the lady whose husband he has just slain in battle. The result is a notably nuanced tale where villains are vanquished, but so are any quaint ideas about right and wrong, pure knights of good intention and fragile women. It's deft, beautifully drawn and wholly satisfying..... Read More.
