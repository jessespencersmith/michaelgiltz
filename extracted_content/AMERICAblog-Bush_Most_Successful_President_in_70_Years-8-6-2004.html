8/06/2004 01:30:00 PMAt losing jobs, that is. Job growth ground to a halt in July -- down toa miniscule 32,000 jobs; which is far lower than expected. Also, thenumber of jobs created in May and June has been revised downwardby nearly 20% from 347,000 to just 283,000. More bad news: weeklypay for rank-and-file workers over the past year has risen only 2.4%,which is significantly less than the 3% inflation rate. In other words,most people are falling behind in real dollars. Bush is almost certainto become the first President in 72 years to run for reelection afterpresiding over an economy that has fewer jobs than when he enteredoffice. The last one was Herbert Hoover, who had to deal with theGreat Depression. Needless to say, Hoover lost.
