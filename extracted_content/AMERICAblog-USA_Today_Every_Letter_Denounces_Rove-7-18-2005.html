7/18/2005 02:10:00 PMThe American people are angry about Karl Rove and angry thatGeorge Bush refuses to honor his word about firing any leaker.Every letter in Monday's USA Today denounces Bush and Rove.The money quote:Rove, whom we all thought was a genius, is using grade-school excuses regarding his role, saying he referred toPlame not by name, but as Wilson's wife. Of course, Wilsonhas only one wife and there is only one CIA, but we aresupposed to excuse him.The American people are smarter than all of this. We seethis act as unethical and Rove as not the kind of personwho can be trusted with power.The president is known for being loyal. Will his loyalty restwith his old friend Karl or with the people who re-electedhim?Wait till they see Bush trying to weasel out of firing anyone guilty ofleaking. How is the letters page on Rove running in your newspapers?And keep those letters to the editor flowing into your local papers -- itkeeps the letters page focused on Bush's deceit and spurs thenewspapers into maintaining their focus.
