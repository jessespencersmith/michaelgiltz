Graham Norton's 
talk show and its 
naughty sense of 
humor have found 
a home in the U.S. 
Graham Norton ready to 
laugh it up in the U.S. 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
TAPING dozens of 
promotional spots 
plugging a show for 
local cable companies 
can get tiresome. But 
Graham Norton -the 
naughty-minded UK talk 
show host set to conquer 
America -is finding it a 
source of endless amuse­
ment. 
Norton giggles help­
lessly after he realizes 
that he is about to read a 
prepared line that goes: 
uOh, come now, Cox cus­
tomers, don't try and 
pretend that wasn't fun." 
(He does not know that 
Atlanta-based Cox Cable 
is one the biggest opera­
tors in the U.S.) 
"Why would you call 
something that?" laughs 
Norton, who has just 
begun a 13-week run on 
Comedy Central with a 
new talk show, "The 
Graham Norton Ef­
fect." "That's just mean." 
Mean is exactly what 
Norton's good-natured 
shtick is not. Though his 
talk show is filled with 
silly sex toys, randy Web 
sites (like one devoted to 
a man's fetish for watch­
ing women brush their 
teeth) and stories that would make Congress­
man Jack Ryan blush, 
Norton isn't mean or 
dirty in the Howard 
Stern way. 
He just reacts with 
shocked glee over the 
awfully embarrassing 
things celebrities and au­
dience members can't 
wait to reveal. 
A huge star in the UK, 
Norton's most recent 
show aired five days a

week (almost unheard of 
in Great Britain, where 
they have no tradition of 
daily taik shows like 
"The Tonight Show"). 
So filming one show a 
week here (it airs Thurs­
days at 10 p.m.) seems 
like a vacation. 
"That's a good thing 
but also a bad thing," 
says the 41-year-old 
Irish-born comic. "I'm 
not sure what will finish 
first -the series or my 
liver. 
''I'm living in New York, and I haven't quite 
figured out yet that that 
doesn't mean you have to 
stay out 'til four every 
night. The city that never 
sleeps? That can't be 
true. Oh. but it is." 
He's just bought an 
apartment in Chelsea, 
proof that he's serious 
about putting in the time 
to become as well known 
here as he is in the UK. 
Of course, if the U.S. 
show clicks, Norton 
could have a terrible 
problem: He's committed 
to both Comedy Central 
for two years (which has 
an option for an extra 
nine shows and a second 
season) and a brand-new, 
family-oriented variety 
show for the BBC. That's 
set to launch in October 
but doesn't even have a 
firm format yet. 
Point out that those 
two commitments could 
very well overlap, and 
Norton laughs. 
"It's a lovely problem 
to even contemplate," 
says Norton. "Presum­
ably, if this show is a dis­
aster, I'll be on my way 
to JFK with a thank-you 
note, if that: 
"And I'll be paying for 
the cab myself." 89
