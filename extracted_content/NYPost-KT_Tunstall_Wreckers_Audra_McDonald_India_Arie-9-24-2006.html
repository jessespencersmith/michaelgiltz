ny three-week span out of the year will find New York filled with world-class 
musicians playing stages large and small, uptown and downtown, in outer 
boroughs and in Manhattan hot spots. But over the next 19 days, an incredible 
array of major artists in multiple genres -Scotland's lIT Tunstall, Russian-born 
Regina Spektor, the country female duo the Wreckers, Grammy winner India.Arie, 
singer-songwriter Nellie McKay, and Tony winner Audra McDonald -will descend 
on, the city. That hum you hear is the whole town getting in the groove. 
KT TUNSTALL ~ 
CD: "Eye to the Telescope" 
NEXT UP: "Acoustic Extravaganza," 
due Oct. 17 
Performs: Oct. 6 and 7 at Webster Hall 
America's first glimpse of the talents of 
Scottish singer·songwriter lIT Tunstall 
came when "American Idol" contestant 
Katharine McPhee perfonned Tunstall's 
U.K. hit "Black Horse and the ChenyTree" 
on her knees in front of millions of view­
ers. It gave McPhee instant credibility and 
earned raves from Sinton Cowell. 
But it was strange for the worn· 
an whose song it was, since Tun-
stall dumped her lV set a few 
years ago "because it was melt­
ing my brain," Did sbe ques­
tion giving her permission 
to "ldol"? "Tour buses in the U.S_ just kick a­
compared to European ones!" Tun-
stall says with a note of incredulousness . 
"American tour buses are so swanky. They 
have air fresheners and carpets!" 
What really stops her in her tracks is 
how crowds in so many places know the 
words to every song on "Telescope. " (Her 
tune "Miniature Disasters " has been used 
on 1V's "Grey's Anatomy," and "Suddenly 
I See" was in this summer's hit film "The 
Devil Wears Prada.") "It's so bizarre," says 
Tunstall. ''We went to Annapolis . We didn't 
even know there was a place called Annap­
olis. We thought it was a typo. Was it sup· 
posed to be Minneapolis? Indianapolis? 
But it was an amazing show. It's like, you 
close your eyes and you're in your bed­
room playing, then you open your eyes 
and there are people from Ann3.polis in 
your room. It's mad!" 
THE WRECKERS ~ RON SACHS 
it in their faces!" Branch says with a lau 
"But on another level, we worked really 
hard for this and we followed our guts, ; 
it was a big change for both of us. And f 
it to work was pretty miraculous ." 
Even though New York doesn't have; 
country-music station, it feels like home 
the Arizona native (she and Harp recol'( 
the CD at a studio in the Meatpacking lJ 
trict). But soon they'll be back on the rOl 
with Branch's daughter by her side. 
"It was a quandaIy , 
definitely ," says Tun­
stall. "It was a really 
difficiilt decision, be­
cause 1 really don't "She's a good tour baby," says Brand 
"The only thing 1 feel guilty about is tha 
she doesn't see any other children. All s 
CD: ·Stand Still. Look Pretty" knows are roadies. It's funny to se'e'Ule 
Perform: Sept 27 ata benefit at tattooed, basn'\-showered-in-weeks iU: 
like pop reality shows. 
But ... at the end of the 
day, 1 would've been a 
fool to say no. It got my 
song heard by 40 million 
people." 
In the end, Tunstall, 31, 
thought McPhee did a good 
job and was happy to have help 
winning over America the way 
she has the U.K. In Britain, her CD 
"Eye to the Telescope" has been a 
huge critical and commercial success, 
peaking at No.3 and snagging Tun­
stall a Brit Award for Best Female Solo 
Artist. 
"I started coming out to the States in 
faJl2005, doing venues like the living 
Room in New York," says Tunstall. "1 
loved it. Then we did Mercury Lounge. 
And now we've got a few nights at Web­
ster Hall. It's fantastic . But it's a bloody 
massive country." 
Not that she's complaining: Tunstall 
loves the U.S. She lived in Connecticut 
for her senior year of high school and fell 
in love with American music. "I was ac­
tually doing a solo tour of coffee shops," 
she says. "I really couldn't face being like 
Phoebe from 'Friends'! Because I've sat in 
coffee shops and when a girl with a guitar 
came in, I've just groaned . I've felt like, 
Please don't ruin my scone'" 
But now, she says, touring is a dream, 
especially with our great ... tour buses? L...Oo __ ba_T_fo_T_h_T_e_QS_t_,.can_,_ce_r_a_w_QT_e"_e5S __ ...I j come over and start talking baby \all<. • 
Michelle Branch had two hit albums 
as an indie artist; both had gone 
platinum and received strong re­
views. Her close friend Jessica Harp 
was just about to record her major-la­
bel debut. But the two women were 
drawn to the notion of recording coun-
try music as a duo. 
No one else liked the idea. 
"There was a lot of pressure from 
different people," says the 23-year-old 
Branch. "A lot of people weren't hap­
py with this little idea that we had. 
Then a couple weeks after finishing 
the rec.ord, 1 found out I was preg­
nant [Branch is married to her bass 
player, Teddy Landau] . We tried to 
keep it a secret as long as possible. 
"So we were on Maverick Re-
, cords, and 1 felt like they were gon­
. na throw [the CD] out there and if 
it didn't stick, they'd move on." 
Turns out, everyone was wrong 
-even Branch and Harp themselves . As 
the Wreckers, the two have become the 
first country duo to hit No. I with a de­
but single ("Leave the Pieces") since the 
mammoth-selling Brooks & Dunn. Now, 
their little side-project idea has taken on 
a life of its own.

naysayers are now the biggest a-kiss· 
ers. It feels really good it worke<! out this

and Nellie McKay. 
"All these songs, apart from the one

CD: -Get Away From Me" 
Ned Up: "Pretty Little Head" in October 
Performs: At a benefit concert Oct 4 at 
the Hiro Balrroom 
She hasn't even released hl!r second al­
bum yet, but Nellie McKay has had a 
storied, crisis-filled career. Her first 
CD, "Get Away From Me," is often called 
the o)lly double-album debut by a woman 
in history -and McKay had to fight her 
label, Sony, to get it out. Then she and 
Sony parted ways over the length of her 
second CD, "Pretty Uttle Head," which 
was originally slated for 2005. While the 
album was delayed, McKay starred on 
Broadway in "The Threepenny Opera." 
"Pretty" is listed on Amazon.com as 
coming out Oct. 24, but the real date is 
rumored to be Oct. 31. Such confusion is 
par for the course for McKay, but Hallow­
een would be appropriate . since the 24-
year-old mixes rock, folk, rap, jazz, cab­
aret, Broadway stylings and everything 
else into a bewitchingly original brew. 
A member of PETA and a strict veg­
etarian, McKay -born in London but 
brought up mostly in the city and in the 
Poconos -will be part of a concert at the 
Hiro Ballroom co-sponsored by ASPCA 
to benefit rescue groups and promote no; 
kill animal shelters. The bill also includes 
the Beastie Boys, Marshall Crenshaw, 
Deborah Harry and MC Chi Chi Valenti. REGINA SPEKTOR r 
< .. ".''''''' .... ~, • .-.~---- .......... - - ..... ---- .. 
CD: "Begin to Hope" 
Performs:Sept. 27 and 28 at Town Hall 
A Bronx girl by way of Moscow, 
Regina Spektor may have a flashy 
Web site and the obligatory MySpace 
page, but she has developed as an artist in 
a remarkably old-fashioned manner: re­
leasing albums on a smaller label, touring, 
doing the requisite press and slowly work­
ing her way up. Now, Sire Records has re­
leased her sixth -and breakthrough -
album, "Begin to Hope."' 
And like many of the best songwriters, 
Spektor creates tunes that are firmly root­
ed in where she lives. On "That Time," she 
sings, "Hey remember that time when I 
. found a human tooth on Delancey?" And 
"Summer in the City" has a line that cer­
tain New Yorkers might embrace: "I'm so 
lonely lonely lonely/ So , went to a protest 
just to rub up against strangers ." 
Yet it's her song "Fidelity" that stops 
the show. Spektor performed it recently 
on "Late Night With Conan O'Brien," 
prompting the host to gush, "That was 
amazing! That was one of my favorite per­
formances in a long time by anybody!" 
Spektor, for her part, smiled shyly . 
But it's the fans seeing her live who can 
really smile. On "Fidelity," she delivers 
the line"._ and it breaks my heart" with a 
catchy sort of stutter, singing the last word 
as a plaintive "he-aaaaaaa-rrr-t-t-t ." Any­
one singing along to the song on an iPod 
would sound silly Yet with hundreds of 
people joining in with Spektor, it'll sound 
just right. 
INDIA.ARIE V 
CD: "Testimony : Vol. I, Life & 
RelatioJlShip" 
Porforms: Oct 7 at U,e Beacon 
S omerhing happens when IndiaArie 
sings t.he song" Privale Party" from 
her new album. SomeLhing 5011 of ... 
intimate. 
" 'Private Party' is very sexy to me," 
she says, "because it talks about the fe­
male anatomy and appreciating it, you 
know what I mean? The way' feel when 1 
sing it -, don't know what! do with my 
body, but the band is always like, 'Wooh!' I 
haven't seen myself [do that].' haven't re­
corded any of the shows. They're always 
like, 'Dang, where'd you get that?'" 
All that won't come as a surprise to any­
one who's seen Arie live. But her first two 
CDs were so smart, and so aware 
of the world around her. that 
people might be forgiven for 
thinking that she's always 
at political protests wear­
ing traditional garb. 
(She addresses the idea ' 
in the first single. "\ 
Am Not My Hair.") 
"When I hear a lot 
of my earlier mUSIC, 
I hear a female but 
one lacking a sen­
suality-there's a 
lack of sexuality in the 
sOW'ld," ays the worn· " 
an born India Me Simp-"", 
son and raised in Atlanta. " 
"I think a lot of people relate to -, 
me in that way. If I have on a pair 
of jeans, people are like, 'Oh my 
God, look at you!' Everybod y 
wears jeans, but when' wear a 
pair, it becomes a big deal. 
"They say, 'I didn't know you 
were curvaceous like that.' My 
past two albums had, for lack 
of a better word, an asexual 
type of energy. I think even though the subject matter Ion the new CD] 
is not sexual, because it talks about rela­
tionships, it has a more sensual element to 
it. And that, to me, is very womanly ." 
It also talks about heartbreak : Arie was 
in a serious relationship, one she thought 
was heading toward marriage, that sud­
denly ended, and she says it took three 
years to work through the anger and 
pain and produce "Testimony" songs like 
"There's Hope" and '" Choose," tunes that 
embrace forgiveness and self-respect . 
She has always had huge success; her 
first two CDs have sold 3 million copies, 
and Arie has won two Grammys and been 
nominated for 12 -but "Testimony" de­
buted at No. I, giving Motown Records its 
first chart -topper since Diana Ross' "Lady 
Sings the Blues" in 1972. 
"Yeah, it is satisfying, because I did what 
I wanted to do and it worked," says Arie, 
who'll turn 31 four days before her Beacon 
show. "That's what really makes it cool. 
There were days when 1 was really sad go­
ing over the different events in my mind of 
that relationship. Then to go from crying 
on the floor to No.1 on Billboard was a life 
journey that I will always remember ." •
