Now David Milch, the creator of both ofthem, tries his darndest to make me hate it even more with hispronouncements.“I am an instrument of purposes that I don’t fully understand,”[Milch] said, not caring how grand or silly it might sound. “Timewill tell whether I am a wing nut or a megalomaniac,” he added.“The difference between a cult and faith is time. I believe that weare a single organism, and that something is at stake in thisparticular moment.”Oy. But yeah, I'll watch it.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
