 Books: The Biggest News In
Publishing Since The Kindle[Updated]
Read More:  Amazon , Amazon Kindle, Audiobooks , Book

In the smartest move in years by the troubled
book industry, the Thomas Nelson imprintannounced a series of new titles it is releasingthis year in the "NelsonFree" format.  Buy a title
at the regular hardcover price and you'll get afree audiobook AND free electronic book versionincluded.
Imagine if you bought a DVD and had to decide
at the store whether you wanted to watch it onyour TV or your laptop. If you wanted to do both,why you'd have to buy it twice. Imagine if you
bought a CD that could only be played on your home stereo. If you wanted to play it in your car,you'd have to buy another copy. And if you wanted to play it on your iPod, why you'd have to buyyet another copy. So instead of paying $15 for an album, you'd have to pay $45. Crazy, right?
But that's exactly how most publishers treat bookbuyers, even though the internet has made the
distribution of ebooks and audiobooks wildly inexpensive for them. Do you like John Grisham? If
you want a hardcover of The Associate to put on your shelf and share with your spouse, that's
gonna cost you $27.95. Want to listen to it on your iPod or in your car? Well, the audio version will
cost you $44.95. Is your mother living with you but has poor eyesight? You can buy a large printversion also for $27.95. Oh, but you just bought the Kindle. I bet you'd love an electronic version.That would cost $10 for the Kindle version...but it's not available in that format yet. Me, I preferreading Grisham in the mass market paperback format (the small, easily portable version sold atairports). That will be probably $8 or more -- when it comes out in a year or two. So just to readthe new John Grisham any way you want, you would pay about $120. Of course, no one is going todo that, but being forced to choose what way you want to read a book is crazy.
The book world has idiotically followed the disastrous lead of the music industry, which killed the

Men Talk Hillary...single -- the cheap inexpensive way to start collecting music that turned teenagers into lifelong
music consumers. The result? Collapsing album sales softened somewhat by the return of singles
via iTunes (which record companies fought every step of the way). Similarly, the book industry has
decided you HATE to buy cheap paperbacks at $7 and would MUCH RATHER buy $14 paperbacks
in the bulkier trade paperback format, which is a lot heavier and harder to carry around. You also
have to wait a year or more to do so, even though in other parts of the world the paperback is
released the same time as the hardcover.
The book world has sadly imitated the movie industry by haplessly trying to emulate the DVD.
They thought that meant including an author interview at the end of a paperback as an "exciting"
extra.
In truth, Nelson is the first publisher to recognize the lesson of DVDs. DVDs succeeded because
they offered far superior quality than VHS, provided extras like commentary tracks that were
previously impossible and -- this is important -- were the same or cheaper than videotape. Now,
taking advantage of the internet and cheap distribution methods, Nelson has dragged the book
world into the 21st century. Buy the right to read a book and they'll give it to you in every format
possible -- a print edition, an audio edition and an electronic edition so you can read it when and
where you want. And they did it without raising the price. If Random House and Ballantine and
Simon & Schuster and the rest have a brain in their heads, they'll follow suit immediately.
UPDATE : In related news, Amazon -- the maker of the Kindle -- has wisely agreed to begin selling
ebooks for the iPhone and iTouch. Personally, I'd never read more than a poem or very short story
on the iPhone but selling people books any way they want to read them is the right thing to do --and even better if a version for the iPhone were bundled with your hard copy!

I heartily agree with you about trade paperbacks, Michael. There are still a couple of Raymond
Chandler titles I haven't read, and I hate the fact that they're fifteen bucks a pop. The covers are nice,but not that nice!

Thx! With no one agreeing with me about that, I thought maybe I was the only person aroundwho preferred spending less money on a more portable paperback -- $7 rather than $15.Seems obvious to me.

I LOVE books. I used to have about 3000. But I downsized to my favorite 300 in my apartment. Now Ijust get them from the library for free.
3fingerbrown See Profile  I'm a Fan of 3fingerbrown  permalink
As a fellow book-loving apartment dweller, I hear you. My solution to the downsizing problemwas to discard most of my books that are reasonably certain to always be in print. I like "TheGreat Gatsby," but I see no reason why my dog-eared copy has to take up valuable shelfspace for years until I get the urge to read it again. I can simply push a few buttons on mycomputer and amazon or ebay will send me a used copy for a couple of bucks. I see it kind of
like Netflix for classic books.

7. The NelsonFree bundle might be a better price for what you buy---but the article is making anunderlying assumption that isn't true: that people will buy multiple versions of the same book and readthat book in each version. I don't know anyone who starts reading a book, switches a few chapters into an audio, then flips over to their laptop to finish. People don't do that not because they can't or its tooexpensive. They don't do that because that's simply not how people interact with books. Most people
only read a book once--in one format all the way through, so owning multiple versions is probably
irrelevant---and expensive at the hardcover price.
8. There's a contradiction in criticizing bulky, heavy trade paperbacks then praising NelsonFree for only
providing the bulker, heavier hardcover---and selling it for the top price of all available formats. If theargument is you get the weightless, no-bulk ebook or audio, why bother paying the hardcover price if
that's the way you read books?
I think the NelsonFree edition will be interesting to watch, but I doubt it truly a silver bullet for what ails
the publishing industry nor providing consumers what they want.
hmmm....I guess I had a lot more to say about this than I thought I did. Sorry for the long post.

Actually, the book I'm reading -- Dreadnought -- is a good example of
the options that open up with ebooks and bundled multiple formats.No book need ever go out of print with ebooks, so that's great.Dreadnought is available in paperback -- for $21 -- even though it'san 18 year old title. (Somewhat understandable since it's so hefty.) I
couldn't find a paperback (though it's available from Amazon) and bought a used hardcover
version of it and its sequel for about $15 each, I think. The publisher got no money for this
resale. I might have bought an ebook only just for ease of use at $10 and been thrilled. (No
searching around for a title.) But I knew it would be good and if the paperback at $20 ALSO
contained the ebook version I might have been tempted to buy that so I could put it on myshelf. Instead of a $10 sale they would have made a $21 sale they otherwise would have not.Either way, give readers as many options as possible and you win. Force them to choose andyou lose.

8. Again, I believe the multiple formats should be offered at everystage of a book's life, from hardcover to paperback. I hate tradepaperbacks compared to mass market because they're so muchheavier to carry around. I almost never carry around hardcovers forthe same reason. But there are titles I would love to have on my
shelf. Currently, I'm reading a 1000 page work of nonfiction called Dreadnought by Robert KMassie. It's actually difficult to read because it's so heavy and I would LOVE it if the book hadcome with an ebook version I could read on my Kindle, even though I'd still want the
hardcover for my shelf. Maybe some would just want the ebook version. That should come
cheaper, perhaps at the $10 compared to the $25 I paid for the hardcover. Then everyone is
happy.
I don't think offering ebooks and audiobooks for free is a silver bullet but it's long overdue and
NOT offering it will just frustrate readers and hurt sales.
Thx for reading and sharing your thoughts!

Profile7. You're absolutely right. People typically wouldn't buy a book in
audio and a hardcover and a large print format etc. But the Kindlemight change that, just like the iPod allowed people to carry around alot more music than ever before. I would very rarely buy just aneBook. But if I owned a Kindle, buying a book at the store would be a
lot more appealing if I knew I could have the hardcopy at home and take 30 books with me
on my Kindle when I went on a trip. And the flexibility of the Kindle, which allows you to
increase type size for example -- perfect if I loan the book or the kindle to my mom -- makes
purchasing it even more appealing. That flexibility is a huge plus that books could never offerbefore, just iike VHS tapes could never offer commentary tracks or (practically speaking)have room for bonus features like extra scenes, documentaries and so on.

3. The analogy to CD and DVD is false. A CD or DVD is using the SAME format in multiple machines.That doesn't equate to MULTIPLE formats for the same book. The former is one product; the latter is
many.
4. The publishing does not hate any format. Just because they time-release (i.e., hardcover first, thentrade, then mass market) does not mean they are anti-consumer or anti-reader. You can try to arguethat a mass market buyer is a lost buyer if only the trade paperback is available, but, really, so what? Ifthe publisher is making money via trade paperback, they would be dumb to cut their own revenuestream. 5. ebook and audio sales are minuscule compared to other ormats. Their price point is generallybetween paperback and hardcover and they sell fewer copies than hardcover or paperback. AllNelsonFree is doing is giving away something they make little to no money on in the first place.6. NelsonFree isn't "dragging the book world into the 21st century." They are bundling what allpublishers already sell ---giving away the ebook and audio version is a sales gimmick, no different thanbuy one/get two less desirable versions free. An ebook version is not an "extra" included with thehardcover--it's the same thing. Again, the DVD analogy is false---commentary included in a DVD is anactual extra thing included--it's IN ADDITION to the movie, not a different format.
Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
5. ebooks are so new I don't think we can talk about a price point yetthough hopefully Amazon will prevail in making $10 a strong figure.Hopefully ebooks of classic titles long out of print will be say $3 or $4.But unabridged audio books are FAR more expensive, thanks to themultiple CDs or cassette tapes they needed. With digital versions, this
argument collapses and there is no need to charge $40 or $60 or more for a digital audioversion of a book that costs $25 in hardcover. And sales are not miniscule: audio books are
$1 billion slice of the $20 billion consumer market in the US. Nonetheless, they would be wise
to trade that short term profit for the goal of making buying books more appealing. 
6. Again, I'd compare the ebook to the digital download of a movie that comes with manyDVDs and allows you to watch it on your laptop or iPhone or whatever without lugging aroundthe physical copy, just like an ebook lets you do with a novel you've just bought. Nelson isn'tdoing what other publishers are doing. It's the first to see ebooks and audiobooks as multipleways of consuming a particular title, rather than forcing you to choose one format or chargeyou twice. It is exactly as if you had to buy a CD for $15 and then buy it again at iTunes if youwanted to play it on your iPod. That's crazy.
Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
4. I have no particular argument with publishers going from hardcoverto trade over a year or two, just like movies are released in theatersand then three months down the road come out o DVD and then oncable via video on demand. However, that window is collapsing. Itused to be six months to a year before a movie came out o VHS or
DVD (if at all). Now it's a matter of weeks and a number of tiny films are being released intheaters day and day with video on demand. So that's happening more and more often. And
as I said below, they do often release popular books in hardcover and paperback on the
same day in the UK. Making people wait a YEAR has always seemed unsmart to me. Finally,many MANY books are no longer available in mass market editions of $6-8. Now thedominant version for softcover is the trade paperback which is $14-18 or more. They'veeffectively doubled the cost of paperbacks and wonder why sales are moribund. This isespecially annoying when they want you to buy, say, 12 titles in a series like HoratioHornblower, which is 50 years old. Not a smart business tactic. They are losing sales.

I'm not sure the relevance of a 12 title series being 50 years plays into it. Cost of
production does not go down simply because a book is old---or public domain. A
series like that has limited appeal and making them cheaper is not going to double
their sales. It might increase slightly, but probably not enough to justify the printcosts from an economies of scale point of view--which is a business decision, not adisappointed consumer one. I can see an argument for an ebook only edition, butthen you'd have to convince a publisher that it's still worth the production cost.
In light of that, I think your numbers are wrong---according to the AAP website, in
2007, total trade sales were 8.5 billion, audio was only 218 million---and ebooks on67 million. Audiobooks and ebooks combined make up less than 0.5% of tradesales. The market just isn't there to sustain the industry with those formats, so I still
think the NelsonFree package is just a sales gimmick. 
If something like the Kindle was going to have the impact of an iPod, it hasn't
happened. Maybe it will eventually, but iPod succeeded because it met a real,
existing demand. The Kindle hasn't proved it's such a thing because readers--who
have had amply opportunity to buy ebooks prior to Kindle--still aren't buying them in
big enough numbers to call it the savior of the industry.

Yes, but...movies went to video sooner due to market pressure and a way to
maximize profit. For them, their video sales are maximized because they can benefitfrom the advertising dollars spent on the theater release, plus the first-run periodshrank so video is not undercutting theater. Director-to-video is the equivalent ofdirect-to-paperback with no hardcover edition. Publishers simply do not expend the
same marketing dollars per book--or even any dollars on some books. Therefore,
two-marketing-budgets for the price of one does not exist for paperback coming out
sooner for most books. Don't forget---the glitzy marketing campaigns you see for
books is reserved for a fraction of books sold. The simultaneous edition might work
for them---and it would be interesting to see if a Stephen King or Danielle Steelesays sure let's try it. But there is zero marketing budget for most books other thanthe sales force calling on bookstores.
Yes the cost of a trade paperback is double mass market, but I don't think it's true to
say the publishers are purposely doing it wrong. Trade format is the preferred formatby consumers and absent the trade paperback, consumers do not buy mass marketversions except in genre (sf/fantasy/romance etc.)

3. The comparison to CD and DVD is I think, fair. A CD can beplayed on your home stereo, your car stereo and elsewhere. You canalso legally make a digital copy and store that on your computer andyour iPod and your phone, giving you the ability to listen to it in manydifferent ways. A movie can be watched on the disc or your portable
DVD player and many of them now come with a free digital copy you can download to playon your iPhone or laptop without having to lug around the physical DVD. I think that is VERYsimilar to the ability to download an ebook version you can read on your iPhone or Kindle or
laptop. Yes, the audio version must be produced, but most of them are very simply done with
the author (though the talented readers can make a book very special and some audio booksare elaborate radio plays).

1. The NelsonFree "version" sells at the hardcover price. Publishers sell mass market and trade
paperback versions for a reason--price. Ten paperbacks at year at $80 is a significant discount from ten
hardcovers at year at $250. Given the option, people wait for the paperback--the numbers demonstratethat. Paperback editions always sell more than hardcover.
2. Complaining publishers make you wait a year for a paperback is, well, complaining. It's like
complaining movies don't come out on cable before theater release. Again, it's marketplace: the highly
motivated reader with disposable income will buy the hardcover absent a paperback edition. The
publisher does not have an obligation to give instant reader satisfaction for format (and, from my ownexperience, an ebook format is almost always available before or simultaneous with the paperback). Ifthey weren't making money doing it this way, they wouldn't do it. They are in business to sell a product,and the point of any business model is to maximize revenue. It is only a failed business model when itis not meeting its market. The current model apparently works for them. It's only a bad business modelif they make the consumer wait and the consumer doesn't buy. That isn't happening. Just becausesomeone is disgruntled they have to wait, does not make it a failed business model.

Thx for reading and taking the time to share your thoughts, a lot ofwhich are interesting and good.
1. I expect and would urge publishers to keep offering the book in
every format (audio, ebook and print copy) at every stage. If a yearfrom now you bought one of these NelsonFree books in trade
paperback for $14, it should offer the multiple formats. I don't know if that's what Nelson isplanning, but they should. When you're buying a 10 year old book for $8, that too should offerthe multiple formats. Or at the most maybe give you the option of getting them for an extra$1. (Though I'd discourage even that.)2. As I said, they do it overseas. In the UK, books often come out in hardcover andpaperback at the same time. And why not? As you said, many people wait a year or twobecause they WON'T buy a book in hardcover. Why squander all the money and energy youspend on advertising or promotion by making people wait so long to buy a book inpaperback? Some fans will buy hardcover, some trade, some mass market. Ad ALL of themshould come with ebook and audio versions. In fact, their business is not working -- they arefacing a longterm decline in sales and fewer and fewer outlets (especially indie bookstores).
They could def use a shot in the arm.

Your points show the difficult issues facing publishing, but a viable business model
has to support your proposals, and from what I'm seeing of the numbers, it's notmaking sense. I agree the industry needs to do something to improve both itsbottom line and meeting the demand for consumer but, unlike the music industry,publishing is trying different formats and sales models (the NelsonFree is a case inpoint). The argument I think you are presenting is more about the cost to consumer---everything should be cheaper and readily available---than it is about the realities ofcosts and production--everything is more expensive and production should be spentwhere profit can be made. The trick, as in any business, is finding the sweet spot
between the two.
To your point 1, I think you're dismissing publishing as a business--a businessesgoal is to provide a product that maximizes revenue for that business---not throw allits products at the consumer all at once for the same price. We can't complain thatpublishing is losing money and complain that they're sales model maximizes theirprofit. While I think publishing does a lot of things wrong, I don't think rolling outformats over time is necessarily one of them. You'd have to convince me that, say,Random House would make more money but putting out all formats simultaneouslyyet refuses to do it simply because no other publisher is doing it. That makes nosense.

do I really need to pay $15 for Canterbury Tales? 
Here's a failed model:
Step 1: release an overpriced hardcover. 
Step2- When the buzz is over-- and only then-- release the paperback.Step 3: Sell hardcover for $2.00 in a remainder bin.

I agree completely. That's why I'm such a strong proponent of the allbut disappeared mass market paperback (which typically sell for $5-$8 dollars. I go nuts when I want to buy a classic title and only find itin trade with an "exciting" new forward that's supposed to justify mypaying $15 or $18 or more for a book that's more than 100 years old.
Just as annoying is when I dive into a mystery or scifi or adventure series (like the AubreyMaturin sailing books) and they expect me to buy five or 10 or 15 books at $15 each. Absurd.

Hey, long may that model continue. The hardcovers usually go for $5.99 or $6.99 at the bigstores, i.e. a buck or two less than the paperback, which has just come out. That's when I
usually buy the hardback.

Yep, I just say some hardcovers at my library for $5. They
buy a lot of copies to meet demand for reading copies andthen sell off the ones they don't need once desire to get itslows down. So the hardcover of Paolini's Brisinger is $5and the paperback (which will cost $13 in trade and later $8i
in mass market) isn't even out yet.

I love books on audio (audible.com!) but I can see why I would have to pay separately for them, thoughnot the outlandish prices charged for CDs versions, etc, and even on iTunes, where there's no excusebecause there's no packaging. They DO need to be separately produced with a reader (and I'm suregood ones are expensive), director, sound equipment, etc. Maybe you could pay a reduced price forthe auidio version if you own the book in some other format, to cover just those extra costs.

Top-notch readers are indeed wonderful. When you've got Jim Daledoing Harry Potter or virtually a radio play for the Philip Pullmanfantasy books, it's great. But many, many books are just read by theauthor or one of those professional readers who are good but by nomeans highly paid. Their services should be considered part of the
cost of producing a book for consumption, just like movie studios don't blink twice at the tens
of thousands if not more they spend on extras for DVDs like documentaries, audio
commentaries, bonus scenes and the such. Since audio books will be mostly digital asopposed to the bulky CDs or cassettes, the argument for why they should cost twice as muchas the hardcover collapses. If they recorded an audio version for a book in the Eighties orearly 90s and it's more than a decade later and you're buying say a $6 paperback, why notinclude the ebook and audio book for free, or say give buyers the option of paying $1 extrafor either of them?

But people who don't listen to audiobooks or read either of the written versions willresent paying for them. They will argue that the cost of the book should be halvedas they only want half the content. And people who don't want the hard copies will

Profilebuy them and sell or otherwise pass on the books after they've downloaded the
audio/digital versions, and then the publisher (and author) will lose out.
Another issue is that only books in series or by authors that are already popular are
usually made into audiobooks. Publishers already spend loads of money on booksthat aren't successful, this would be asking them to spend even more, if they are
meant to record audio versions of every book. 
Thirdly, publishers don't necessarily buy the audio rights to the books they buy the
rights to print, or if they do, they may then sell them to another company. Authors
may not want to sell them, or may in some cases have sold them before selling the
print rights.

to follow up on others here who mentioned libraries, one doesn't even have to go to the library to take
advantage of some of its offerings since most libraries have a strong internet web site that includessomething called "net library" and "overdrive." there is even an online movie viewing application albeitwith not a great selection of films, but still, it's there for our pleasure.
BTW, i've been getting my DVDs - all the popular movies one could possibly want to see - by reserving
them online at the library web site, and waiting "in line" for them as they circulate around the county. iabsolutely no longer rent DVDs. i can't recall the last time i was in a blockbuster - eight years ago? 
lately however, i've become slightly addicted to "net library" and "overdrive." one can download audio
books to listen on your computer and/or download them as mp3s for your IPOD or other device - or
burn them to a CD. 
one can also download books as an adobe pdf and read it that way. you don't get a too wide of a
selection of titles just yet; not all books in the library are available.
using "net library" and "overdrive" one also has access to a selection of film titles, documentaries, old
TV shows, old radio broadcasts - aside from the other film application i mentioned earlier.
in these budge conscious times, i certainly believe libraries are the way to go.
Michael Giltz - Huffpost Blogger I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Libraries are great. And the more these multiple formats are seen as
just different ways of making a book available (as opposed to treatingan audio or ebook as an entirely different product), the more librarieswill be able to make them available to the people who use them.Hence the move by Nelson should be a boon to library users down
the road if it catches on.

Although the analogy of the publishing industry to the music industry is apt in many ways, one can'tforget the disparity in wealth between the two. The average author (and I say this as a writer with mydebut novel coming out by Avon Books next year) doesn't see much in terms of royalties per book. Forus, the money comes in the form of advances. Royalties, if we see them at all, is much better for
hardcover than soft, better for trade paperback over cheap paperback. So writers and publishers push
for formats that readers find too costly to buy. Until the publishing industry is revolutionized, everyonein the chain suffers--publishers, authors and consumers. It's too soon to tell yet if digital media will bethe means of making writing and reading profitable but if something doesn't change, the literary industrywill fail, to the detriment of all.

There are of course many differences. Knowing many midlist writers,
I certainly feel for them. I also feel that what's good for readers andgets more people reading will ultimately be good for authors. I believeauthors have been fooled into seeing trade paperbacks (at $15 or$18 or more) as "prestigious" whille mass market paperbacks are

seen as trashy. It's crazy when even 20 or 30 year old mystery series (with 10 titles in the
series) are only in trade paperback and thus cost much more. That has kept me from divingin many times and I can't be alone to price sensitivity, especially for a title that's decades old.
I don't think ebooks and audio books can jumpstart the industry or bring back indie book
stores. But NOT embracing them would be a fatal mistake. A book is a book is a book and
someone who buys it should be allowed to read it in as many ways as possible, be it ebook oraudio or paperback or hardcover, on their computer or Kindle or at the beach with the coverbent back. And congrats on having your first book coming out! That's a huge
accomplishment. Thanks to ebooks I hope it never goes out of print (but check your contract

I enjoyed Grisham's "The Associate" about a week after it arrived at our local library. As long as Ireturned it within the allotted time, I did, it was FREE. I have taken library books on planes, vacations,to dr. and dentist appointments. Of course I'm 75 years old and have been able to do without all thesupposed conveniences most of my life. I discovered the library very early in life and have becomeaddicted to it. I am not technical challenged. I retired as an electronic technician.

Libraries are great and economical. My mom (who just turned 80) isthere constantly checking out hardcovers and audio books for the caror trips. If Nelson's approach catches on, it should make it easier forthe library to provide more and more books in more and moreformats for everyone to enjoy.

I guess I'm just old. I love the way a book feels in my hands, awkward or not. I love little paperbacksbecause I can manipulate them to fit the way I read: bend the book in half, even though the pages tendto fall out after a while. (When I'm done with it, I donate it to my local library for their used book sales). Iactually welcome the neck ache I get after spending hours in a bookstore or library reading titles. ButNelsonFree may be on to something: I can get the actual book for myself, and the audio version for mybrother-in-law who commutes an hour each way to work every day--FOR NO ADDITIONAL FEE!A company that is NOT trying to gouge me!!!
What a concept!!!

I agree about loving to hold books in my hand. But I wouldn't mind
with the thousands of dollars I spend on them getting an ebookversion I can put on my Kindle and take to Europe without filling upan extra suitcase and breaking my back. And before the publisherflips out about you giving the audio version to your brother, you could
already share that paperback or audio version you bought with anyone you want. Ease of use
will encourage people to buy more books. Loads of stupid restrictions that don't stop the real

Here at Thomas Nelson, we think NelsonFree is very cool--and frankly--overdue. I love that it actuallyone-ups all the fuss Roy Blount, Jr. and the Author Guild made about the text-to-speech function. Justas you did the math on why NelsonFree works financially for the consumer, I demonstrated whyauthors are better off with a program like NelsonFree financially at my blog yesterdayhttp://consequentialvalue.com/2009/03/03/hit-with-a-blount-instrument/ . 
Also in response to a couple of comments above--1) The libraries ARE working feverishly to developways to add more platforms to their offerings. 2) McKain didn't just sign off on the audio, he did ithimself.

JamezQ, I know many people like you, especially when it
comes to music. I can't imagine not having the actualphysical CD or book in my reach, but others don't care.IGiven the highly limited number of titles available (it'ssomething like 250,000 but that many titles get released
every two years), I also can't imagine limiting myself to ebooks. I'm not a JohnGrisham fan but his latest title for example is not available on the Kindle.MagisterLudi makes some valid points but I don't think it's too pie in the sky to seecopyrights and intellectual property as having a sea change in the next 50 years.
With Google's book imaging project and ebooks proliferating why wouldn't every
single public domain title be available free just like you can get text versions online?I think because of digital ease of access, that 50 years from now just abouteverything from movies to TV shows to books to albums will just be out there, justlike they're in your local library and everyone will have access to everything,certainly everything made 30 years ago and back. It's gonna be great. I don't knowhow writers like me will make money, but it's coming MasterLuigi.

I hate mass market paperbacks: the print is too small, the bindings don't last, the package itself is toosmall. Trade paperbacks are easier to slip into luggage because they're flatter, usually have largerprint, and are simply more comfortable to hold. And that all may be why mass market paperback salesare way down.

Hey guys, thanks for reading. If you prefer trade
paperbacks, great! I'm glad you have the option to buy it inthat format and annoyed that I DON"T have the option tobuy the same title in mass market. You wanna pay $15 forthe same book in trade that I can get for $7 in mass market,
cool. I understand why it's appealing. They last longer and are def sturdier. But mas
market sales are down because very few bestsellers are released in that format
anymore. JustmeinAz, I agree that the Kindle is pricey. I'm sure it'll come down to
below $200, though I think $150 might be the sweet spot for mass consumption.And I HOPE they make ebooks they sell available to every ebook out there, which isexactly what seems to be happening.
