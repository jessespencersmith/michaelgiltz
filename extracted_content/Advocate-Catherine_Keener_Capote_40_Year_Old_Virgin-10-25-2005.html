Catherine Keener 
With four movies this year-including a hit comedy, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and an 
Oscar-bait drama, Capote-Catherine Keener is on fire. Gay men love her work (and 
her husband, Dermot Mulroney). Lesbians just love her. She and I bond over grow­
ing up in Florida amid hurricanes and Anita Bryant ("She was nuts!" laughs Keener) 
and argue over whose Catholic high school volleyball team was better. "Excuse me, 
I was on the volleyball team," she says. 'We were excellent." If Keener were still 
playing, the stands would be full of her queer fans. -Michael Giltz
