            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6Has Nicolas Cage Taught Us Nothing?Some fool sold off his valuable Elvis memorabilia because his girlfriendtold him, "It's me or that white jumpsuit!" CNN reports the poor guy -named Jim Curtin -- had been collecting Elvis memorabilia since hewas 8 years old. Buddy, don't you remember that fellow Elvis buffNicolas Cage sold off all his beloved comic books when the King's owndaughter Lisa Marie made the same ultimatum? And that they divorcedjust about a year and a half after getting hitched? (That's right, no girland no Action Comics #1.)If your woman can't accept that you've devoted most of your life tosome passion and that maybe, just maybe, it's kind of important to you,than perhaps she's not the girl for you. Curtin is a civilian, so I'll givehis marriage three years...followed by a lot of lonely nights for Curtinwith only peanut butter and banana fried sandwiches for company.My favorite Elvis song -- "(Let Me Be) Your Teddy Bear." Yours?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
