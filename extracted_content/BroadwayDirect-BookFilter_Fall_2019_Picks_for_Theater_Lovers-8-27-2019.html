take their bow, exclusively for Broadway Direct.
Kids are coming back from their summers at theater camp, high school students are eagerly
auditioning for the part they’ve just got to get in the fall production, and actors are returninghome after a season in the hectic but blissfully happy world of regional theater, where thequality is high, audiences are generous, and critics are mostly invisible. And as fall approaches,unexpected projects are being announced almost every day and new shows are in preview. Butin between matinees and cabarets and cast album parties, we have a stack of theater-relatedbooks to catch up on! Here are the latest.
The Chelsea Girls
BOOKFILTER’S 2019 FALL PICKS FOR THEATER LOVERS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | AUGUST 27, 2019
SHARE</p>
<p>By Fiona Davis
$27, DuttonOut now
Best-selling author Fiona Davis may have her biggest hit yet with this 1950s-set drama about
the Chelsea Hotel, McCarthyism, and two women making their mark in the world of theater. Afew years before the marvelous Mrs. Maisel took her first tentative step onto the stage of acomedy club, other women were paving the way. Maxine Mead is an actress. Hazel Riley is aplaywright. Using the (in)famous Chelsea Hotel as their headquarters, these fast friends decidethere’s no reason they shouldn’t produce the Broadway show they want to see. (And withwomen as lead producers of many of this year’s Tony winners, obviously they were right.) Well,the Red Scare might have something to say about that, in this tale spanning from the 1940s tothe 1960s with flair and fun. What should come first? The Netflix miniseries or the stageadaptation?
Summertime: George Gershwin’s Life in Music</p>
<p>By Richard Crawford
$39.95, W.W. Norton and CompanyOut September 3
Here’s a great trend in biographies about the major talents of the theater: books that
concentrate on their work rather than on the ins and outs of their love lives. Richard Crawford,who teaches at the University of Michigan, is just as excited by George Gershwin’s classicalcomposition “An Experiment in Modern Music” as he is by the musical Girl Crazy.  Deftly mixing
in Gershwin’s own letters and notes along with stories from those who knew him well, Crawfordilluminates Gershwin’s remarkable musical legacy and shares enough anecdotes and freshinsights to keep everyone happy.
Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution</p>
<p>By Todd S. Purdum
$20, PicadorOut now
Like the Gershwin bio above, Todd Purdum’s look at the theatrical revolution led by Richard
Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein remains happily focused on their groundbreaking shows.Their working relationship and private travails are appropriate background to the work theycreated, rather than the other way around. One of the best-selling theater books in recent years,it’s out now in paperback.
The Prom: A Novel Based on the Hit Broadway Musical</p>
<p>By Saundra Mitchell
$17.99, Viking for Younger ReadersOut September 10
We’re glass-half-full people at Broadway Direct. So, instead of fretting that the theater-loving
musical The Prom didn’t run even longer on Broadway than it did, we want to celebrate that anoriginal show made it to the Great White Way in the first place. Thanks to good reviews and thelove of theater buffs, its story is just beginning. Producer Ryan Murphy is turning it into a filmstarring Meryl Streep, James Corden, Awkwafina, Andrew Rannells, Nicole Kidman, andKeegan-Michael Key. Just read those names again, please! It hits theaters in October 2020 andthen heads to Netflix. A national tour starts in February 2021. And right now, we have a young-adult novelization by Saundra Mitchell, following in the wake of Dear Evan Hansen’ s. And then
high schools will start to produce the musical and some parent somewhere will object andBroadway and movie stars will descend on the town and it will start all over again…
The Backstage Bible
By Neil Fraser
$30.95, Nick Hern BooksOut September 3
OK, you have a son or daughter who yearns for a life in the theater. But acting or directing?
That’s not their thing. If they’re technically minded, one of the many creative jobs behind the</p>
<p>scenes may be just the ticket. Costuming, lighting, stage managing — it takes a village to put
on a show. Happily, The Backstage Bible by Neil Fraser gives a glimpse into what goes on
behind the velvet curtain. Fraser is a genius lighting designer and the head of technical trainingat the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, so he knows his stuff.
The Piano Recital
By Akiko Miyakoshi
$16.99, Kids Can PressOut September 3
Who doesn’t get nervous when they have to appear in front of an audience? Certainly, Momo
does as she gets ready for her very first piano recital. She stands backstage waiting her turn,quietly telling herself, “I’ll be okay … I’ll be okay.” And then she hears a little voice repeating thesame mantra. It’s a tiny mouse, who tells Momo that the mice are having a piano recital too!This gorgeous black-and-white picture book tells its sweet, encouraging story in a manner eventhe smallest child can follow via the images alone. But anyone needing to stand up and face acrowd will take comfort from it.
Pocket Playhouse</p>
<p>By Michael Frayn
$16.95, Faber & FaberOut now
Few playwrights have succeeded so dramatically in both comedies and dramas like Michael
Frayn has. Noises Off  is one of the all-time great comedies, and Copenhagen  is just the
brainiest of his many successful dramas. Yet Frayn’s talent doesn’t stop there. He has alsodelivered terrific novels such as Headlong,  screenplays such as Clockwise,  nonfiction,
journalism, witty newspaper columns, great Chekhov adaptations, and a memoir about hisfather. So you’d think more attention would be paid when Frayn delivers any work in anymedium. Yet this beguiling collection of 36 sketches has slipped into stores virtually unheralded.Maybe he should have posted them individually first on Instagram with accompanyingillustrations and been hailed a genius (again)? Don’t let this slip away.
Fleabag: The Special Edition (The Original Play)</p>
<p>By Phoebe Waller-Bridge
$15, Nick Hern BooksOut August 29
OK, it’s only available on import. And it’s only the original play and doesn’t include the scripts for
the two seasons of the TV series or a single picture of the Hot Priest. Heck, there’s not even asneak-preview zinger from her punch-up work on the next James Bond offering. But this iswhere the career of Phoebe Waller-Bridge caught fire, and it does include the brilliantly originalplay that launched her to fame. Plus, you get new color photos and new content fromcollaborators including director Vicky Jones and other members of the creative team, along withWaller-Bridge herself.
Barnum: An American Life</p>
<p>By Robert Wilson
$28, Simon & SchusterOut now
He may not have looked exactly like  Hugh Jackman, but P.T. Barnum was the showman of
showmen who has influenced Broadway producers and hucksters and PR flacks and stars formore than a century. The first serious biography in decades, Robert Wilson’s work has alreadybeen trumpeted on the front page of the New York Times  Book Review . Barnum surely would
have expected no less. But he didn’t just hype nonsense, like the discovery of a “mermaid.”Barnum also delivered the goods in both entertainment and education, and according to allaccounts, author Wilson (the editor of The American Scholar ) does the same here.
Swan Lake</p>
<p>By New York City Ballet and Valeria Docampo
$17.99, Little SimonOut now
The third in an inspired series of picture books. Using an acclaimed production by the New York
City Ballet as its inspiration, this brings to life the ballet Swan Lake  in a way little children and
dance aficionados can both delight in.
Ensemble: An Oral History of Chicago Theater
By Mark Larson</p>
<p>$35, Agate Midway
Out now
It hardly needs saying that theater stretches across the United States and, indeed, the globe.
From school productions to community theater and touring shows, theater comes in a wonderfularray of shapes and sizes. Yet some cities thrive more than others when it comes to creatingnew works. Los Angeles is proving more and more vital, but it has a long way to go before itcatches up with Chicago. One of the most exciting sources of talent, the city gets its due in thisoral history of Chicago theater. It’s a treat, whether you head to the Windy City for theatricalexcursions or simply want to learn more about this crucible for so much great theater you’veenjoyed over the years.
City of Girls
By Elizabeth Gilbert
$28, Riverhead BooksOut now
Eat. Pray. Love. Go to the theatre. That’s our motto, and memoirist and best-selling author
Elizabeth Gilbert brings it to life in this acclaimed sexy work about life in the freewheeling worldof the 1940s New York theater scene. Our heroine is 19-year-old Vivian, kicked out of VassarCollege for doing better at extracurricular activities than she did at her studies. As punishment(or desperation), Vivian is sent to NYC to live with her bohemian aunt Peg, the owner of awonderfully down-on-its-heels theatre called the Lily Playhouse. And since that sounds a lot like</p>
<p>dying and going to heaven, you know that whatever stumbling blocks appear (and there are
many), Vivian’s adventure is going to be great fun. Expect a lot of vivid theatrical sorts and a lot
of carpe diem, including of the Sapphic variety. Quel scandale!
The Flower Whisperer
By Joel Grey
$65, Powerhouse BooksOut now
What a moment the legendary talent Joel Grey is having. He directed a hugely successful
revival of Fiddler on the Roof  that’s being performed entirely in Yiddish, and it has brought that
dependable war horse vividly back to life. (It’s playing and playing for the foreseeable future inNew York City with no end in sight.) His Emcee from Cabaret  continues to inspire everyone (see
the new Moulin Rouge!  and Danny Burstein’s loving spin on the character). And now one of his
many other talents earns the spotlight in this art book of his sensual, dramatic photography thatcaptures the flowers he loves so much in all their spectacular glory.
Midsummer’s Mayhem</p>
<p>By Rajani LaRocca
$16.99, Yellow JacketOut now
This sweet young-adult novel puts a very fresh spin on Shakespeare’s romantic and magical
play A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Mimi is the youngest of her overachieving Indian Americanfamily and yearns to figure out how to make her mark. A love of cooking and a contest at thelocal bakery seem just the ticket. (It helps to watch The Great British Bake Off  on a constant
loop.) Mimi lives in Massachusetts, but somehow a mysterious boy named Vic leads her deeperand deeper into the forest behind her house and she discovers banyan trees, wild boars … andflowers bursting with nectar along with other exotic, almost magical ingredients. Trying out hernew skills on the family, Mimi watches as her dad eats and eats and eats, her brother falls inlove with his own image (a future actor, surely), and her other siblings cause havoc with suddenromantic entanglements. Hm, it sounds a lot like … Yes, but the fresh setting and delightfulheroine make this more than just a variation on Will. It’s its own fresh and delicious tale.
The Show Won’t Go On: The Most Shocking, Bizarre and Historic Deaths of Performers
Onstage</p>
<p>By Jeff Abraham and Burt Kearns
$16.99, Chicago Review PressOut September 3
Stand-up comics love to kill on stage, but nobody wants to die on it. Sometimes it the former
happens and you blame the writer (assuming it’s not you). But sometimes the latter reallyhappens and there is nobody to blame but fickle fate. The authors of this offbeat compendiumpulled together every example they could find of people literally dying on stage, from magicianson TV to daredevils at the circus and an amateur actor who had the good (or bad) taste to diein a play called The Art of Murder. So take grim humor in knowing that however badly a showbombed, it could have been worse. Much worse.
Michael Giltz is the creator of the website  BookFilter,  a book lover’s best friend. He has written
for Huffington Post,  New York Post, New York Daily News, Los Angeles Times, The
Advocate,  and many other publications, profiling talent, covering the theater business, and

reading about it.
