<p>PRIME SUSPECT: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION  ($124.99l Acorn) -- No question about it,
Detective Jane Tennison is one of the great TV characters of all time. And if you say "one of the great
female  TV characters," then you're little better than the casually sexist men she has to deal with and fight
and gain the respect of during this series. The first two miniseries stand alone and are absolutely
brilliant. The quality dips and dives after that (the third mystery is good, the fourth through sixth so-soand the seventh a decent swan song) but what never wavers is the uncompromising brilliance of HelenMirren. if you already own these movies, there's no reason to upgrade; the picture is marginally better if
not identical to previous versions and the extras are nice if minimal. Also, it's a shame they didn't create a
more compact set for this 9 disc collection. But if you haven't seen them or don't own them yet, you'llundoubtedly want to watch them all and own at least the first two.
THE EVERLY BROTHERS REUNION CONCERT  ($11.98; Eagle Records) -- One of the great rock
duos of all time, I fell for the Everly Brothers just after this legendary reunion concert took place. They
recorded a new album -- EB 84  (absurdly, out of print) -- filled with great originals and some choice
covers (Dylan, a new Paul McCartney song written just for them, etc.) that stood up to their best. Little
did I know they'd been feuding for a good decade right up to September 23, 1983, when Don and Phil set
aside their differences and reunited onstage (really reunited; they didn't even rehearse) for this London
show. Their voices may have deepened but they blended together with the same magic as their heydaywhile delivering hits like "Bye Bye Love" and "All I Have To Do Is Dream." Their joy in performingtogether again is palpable and set them touring and recording for much of the next decade to solid
success. No wonder they rate this night as a highlight of their long and illustrious career. The bonus
feature is a shortened version of a documentary running about 45 minutes. The concert itself is in decentshape visually and sounds good. It's not a brilliant film so much as a document of a very special moment.
Fans who don't own it will be pleased. If you don't know them,  for heaven's sake, start listening.

<p>ROBIN HOOD  ($39.98 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; Universal) -- Everyone wants to reboot
franchises and get gritty and do unexpected origin stories and mix it up so they can make a stodgy old
"property" seem cool. But when you're running in fright from every single identifiable element of aclassic tale (in this case: the tights, the Merry Men, the archery, a nobleman risking everything to helpout the weak, and most of all the fun), then something is wrong and you should ask yourself, why has this
tale been popular for hundreds of years and why am I avoiding so much of that story? It's a shame,
because Russell Crowe makes a good Hood, even if his embrace of Universal Human Rights comeshundreds of years early and seems a little silly. But the film really gets daft at the finale where MaidMarian (Cate Blanchett who, not surprisingly has been strong and proto-feminist throughout) plays an
absurd part in battle. Loaded with extras and it certainly looks and sounds good. But what a shame.
FANTOMAS: THE COMPLETE SAGA  ($34.95; Kino) -- This collection of five serials starring the
dastardly criminal Fantomas is catnip for silent film buffs. First, Kino presents the films with care,including commentary and shorts from director Louis Feuillade ( Les Vampires ). Dating from 1913-1914,
it's one long epic tale in which the criminal is truly vicious, the police relentless and the adventures grow
increasingly baroque and outrageous. And the price is perfect for a specialty item like this that can't have
been cheap to produce. It's just inexpensive enough to encourage casual movie buffs to check it out, while
fans of serials and Fantomas won't have to break the bank to enjoy them. Great fun.TOP VIDEO PICKS

<p>THE BIG BANG THEORY THIRD SEASON  ($54.97 BluRay or $44.98 regular; Warner Bros.)
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA SEASON FIVE  ($49.98 BluRay or $39.98 regular;
FOX)
CASTLE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON  ($45.99; ABC) -- Okay, tv boxed sets come fast and furious
so here goes. Glee  is wildly uneven, but it's so fresh and original and the episodes that do hit their target
are so enjoyable that it's a can't miss TV show, even when it misses. (Does that make any sense?) Plus,you can just watch the musical numbers when that's what you're in the mood for...or do karaoke, which I
never do. I swear. I understand why Big Bang Theory  is successful -- it's a joke machine. But it's also
relentlessly "jokey" with nary a moment for real characters to peep through. Funnier than many sitcomsbut to me never more than fitfully amusing. Sunny In Philadelphia , on the other hand, is original and
fresh in a Seinfeld/Arrested Development  sort of way. The addition of Danny DeVito has been a blessing
and the cast has grown in confidence. As they warn you on the set, the show was shot in standard def
(basic cable shows can't always afford fancy cameras) so no real point in splurging on the BluRay for thisone. And finally I am thrilled that Nathan Fillion is in an honest to goodness hit with Castle . Yeah, this is
a standard issue mystery show but he's got charm to spare and great chemistry with his cop costar (Stana
Katic) and it's undeniably fun, even if I don't feel gutted when I miss an episode. And how much more do
we appreciate his poker night with mystery writer buddies like Stephen J. Cannell now that Cannell is
gone for good? And yes, I do keep thinking, wow, since this show is a hit do you think maybe they'll bring
back Firefly.
JANEANE GAROFALO: IF YOU WILL  ($17.97 BluRay and $14.97 regular; Image) 
BILL MAHER: BUT I'M NOT WRONG  ($19.98; HBO) -- The latest performances by two stand up
comics who struck it big. Garofalo is probably better known for her acting and radio gigs than her stand-up. But after a long absence, she returns to the stage with a more self-deprecating, more generous if stillrazor sharp outlook on life. Nothing groundbreaking here, but she's funny and puts enough of a spin onTwitter and semi-fame to make the hour spent with her worthwhile. (You gotta love someone who tells a
story on themselves about walking into a Starbucks and having an employee say, "No offense, but you
look like Janeane Garofalo.") Bill Maher, on the other hand, is less effective as a stand-up today becausehe's so clearly found the perfect medium for his witty insights on his TV political shows, including the
current HBO series Real Time With Bill Maher , which is the only thing that keeps me sane when politics
and especially the media coverage of politics can be so asinine. Maher is really smart and pointed and
focused on that show; he'll make a funny joke if he can, but not to defuse the subject or let his</p>
<p>interviewee off the hook the way Jon Stewart might. Maher's jokes always skewer pretension and lies too
deftly for that. Stand-up just seems superfluous when his real gift is political commentary. Mind you, he'sstill fun to see and I hope some other topic engages him the way religion did and he makes another
documentary because Religulous  was great. But plain old stand-up makes me feel like I'm not getting the
full Maher. It's like going to a massage parlor and having them walk away before the happy ending.Maher would never stand for that, would he?
TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE  ($39.99 BluRay and $29.99 regular; Disney)
THE BLACK CAULDRON  ($19.99; Disney) -- I give Disney a lot of grief for their straight-to-DVD line
of movies, which I think cheapen major properties like The Lion King.  But it's often a proving ground for
new talent that graduates to feature films. Plus, when they're focusing on a minor character like Tink and
building her up, it doesn't seem so awful to me. This is the third Tinkerbell feature and the series is
improving and showing a little more spunk and action, which is welcome in a girl-oriented series like
this. Why should the boys have all the fun? And the guest voices (Kristen Chenoweth, Michael Sheen) aretop-notch. The Black Cauldron  has always been an intriguing example of the road not taken by Disney. It
was a PG film made during the early days of their renaissance (right after The Fox and the Hound  but
before The Great Mouse Detective  and of course The Little Mermaid ). It's based on a series of fantasy
books and relatively darker (hence the PG rating) though hardly envelope-pushing in any way except atad more scary to very small kids. Disney wanted to break out of its formula but couldn't quite bring itself
to do so; the mature fantasy is undercut by typical Disney comic relief. Plus, they weren't ready to do
really stunning animation yet so the backdrops are nice but relatively flat and static. Close, but no cigar,which is a shame: animated features are too constrained by the family friendly formula when they shouldbe tackling sci-fi and so many other genres...and not always have to be appropriate for eight year olds.</p>
<p>THE THIRD MAN  ($39.98 BluRay; Lionsgate/Studio Canal) 
DELICATESSEN  ($39.99 BluRay; Lionsgate/Studio Canal) -- Two great films offered in BluRay by
Studio Canal, which has funded thousands of movies over the years and recently launched a line of DVDs
branded with its name. The Third Man  is a masterpiece, of course, with Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles
superb in Carol Reed's dark tale of post-war Europe. The question is how does it compare to the now out-of-print Criterion BluRay it in effect replaces? Basically, not so good. The extras are solid, though not asthorough; still, I do appreciate hearing from Welles biographer Simon Callow and clearly Studio Canal
knew they needed to do a solid job on that front. But the most important issue is the film itself and
clearly this remastering is softer and not nearly as sharp and crisp as the Criterion print. Since The ThirdMan is one of the great films of all time (and taught me the meaning of mise en scene), its image is of
paramount importance. It's a decent print, better than you'd see in many revival houses back when theyhad revival houses or showed old prints on late night TV. If you have nothing to compare it to it's fine.But not world class. If it's all you can get, you needn't fret; but it's a shame they didn't do better. Studio
Canal is on firmer ground with the more recent film Delicatessen , a very black comedy from Jeanet &
Caro, responsible together or alone for later films like Amelie  and A Very Long Engagement. This is a
striking film with wildly inventive camerawork. I have no earlier print to compare it to, but it seemsrather...orange. And yet, I think that might be the choice of the directors, who also filmed many scenes
with fog for their post-apocalyptic (?) tale of very hungry apartment dwellers. In short, the Studio Canalbrand promises solid extras and decent prints that are acceptable if not the absolute premium best.
