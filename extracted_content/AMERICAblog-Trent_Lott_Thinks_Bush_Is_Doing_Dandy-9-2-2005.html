9/03/2005 01:36:00 PMThis was last night (Friday) on CNN (hey, there's a lot to keeptrack of). Anderson Cooper asked more tough, reasonablequestions and politicans like Trent Lott show how completelydivorced from reality they are.Cooper: So you're pleased with the Federal government'sresponse?Lott: I AM pleased with the federal government'sresponse...this is not a time for complaining...I am reallyshocked at the comments that are coming.Yes, how DARE anyone question why Bush and Cheney stayed onvacation and Condi WENT on vacation after the worst natural disasterin our nation's history.
