A PUBLIC READING OF AN UNPRODUCED SCREENPLAY ABOUT THE DEATH
OF WALT DISNEY  *** out of ****
May is when one season of theater ends and another begins. Awards are handed outand some new shows appear after biding their time by waiting for the crush of Tonyhopefuls to thin out. So here I'll catch up on two final shows from the Broadwayseason: Bette Midler's return to the stage and a lauded revival of Pippin . That's
followed by two far more promising indications of the season to come: a delightfulevening of one acts by the Pearl Theatre Company and a new play by one of themost promising writers around.
I'LL EAT YOU LAST  ** 1/2 out of ****
BOOTH THEATRE
What a treat to see Bette Midler up close and personal in a one-woman show that
suits her to a t. If you want to see the Divine Miss M dish a little dirt and have a little
fun playing super-agent Sue Mengers -- another larger than life personality -- by all
means do what you can to see I'll Eat You Last.  You won't be disappointed.
The play itself is a trifle by John Logan barely worth discussing. Mengers was a superagent of the old school, a brassy pioneering woman who broke her way into thebusiness and loved, loved, loved every minute of it -- cursing on the phone at a studiochief, wooing stars, hosting parties with all her twinklies (her nickname for celebs) andgenerally having a blast. Mengers was so unique she even enjoyed a profile on 60Minutes.
Here we see Mengers holding court on her couch hours before she's to host another
party. It's the fateful day Barbra Streisand fired her longtime friend Mengers, a blowMengers never really recovered from though she knew getting fired was always partof the game. It's late afternoon and the sun slowly sets as Mengers tells her tale --from a chubby little German Jewish immigrant whose bravest act was to cross theschool playground and talk to the popular girls to the would-be actress who found her
calling by discovering the talent in others and selling it to directors and studios and the
media.

<p>Midler to develop a real performance when she might have just put her own brassy
spin on well-worn anecdotes from Mengers' career. But Midler is a Broadway baby
who appeared in Fiddler On The Roof  for three years as one of her early big breaks.
She just sits on a couch but she also works hard to make each slump, each pause,each decision to lean forward or slip to the side actually be driven by the text. She
might have coasted but instead Midler works hard and delivers soundly. I won't quite
say she was robbed since this season saw so many good female performances but
now that I've seen the show I'm even more surprised she wasn't recognized by the
Tonys.
As for the show? They got that one right by ignoring it. You get a fair amount of
laughs but those all come courtesy of Mengers. The best anecdote revolves around
actress Ali McGraw and how Mengers was actually human enough to recognize that
some things are more important than a movie career. (A rare trait indeed, inHollywood.) But the setting, the platitudes, the late afternoon to the dark of night timeframe all feel by the numbers and obvious. Mengers was far more complicated andinteresting than that. Logan scratches the surface and nothing more. Midler, happily,digs as deep as she can.
PIPPIN  * out of ****
THE MUSIC BOX
I'd never seen Pippin  before, just heard about its legendary Broadway run in the
1970s that featured choreography by Bob Fosse and turned Ben Vereen into a star.
Why I wondered was it never revived? Now I know.
This flimsy excuse for a show -- young prince wants to see the world and find some
real purpose in life -- must have seemed dated even as it ended its four and a halfyear run in 1977. Director Diane Paulus took a similar time capsule of a show calledHair and found some magic in it. However, that show had better songs and the
backdrop of Vietnam to give its soul searching some context. Pippin's score byStephen Schwartz is notably weak with only "Corner Of The Sky," "Moonglow" andthe ditty "No Time At All" leaving any impression at all. Even that is undercut by thefact that Pippin himself (Matthew James Thomas) is no belter, try as he might.
The book by Roger O. Hirson is a mish mash that feels more like a sketch than a
proper story. The scenic design by Scott Pask and especially the costumes byDominique Lemieux are uniformly ugly. I didn't like it. If you're an ardent fan of thisshow from your childhood, a return visit might prove a rude awakening. If you've neverseen it, you're forewarned.
Surrounding the story is a non-stop circus of tumblers and acrobats and the like. Myguest wondered what the heck the point of it was. But obviously if all you had to watchwas the story itself, the baldness of the material would be even more apparent. Still,it's nothing you haven't seen in the first five minutes of any Cirque Du Soleil show.(They're credited to Gypsy Snider.)
While all that jumping and juggling is going on, the Leading Player (Patina Miller) is
narrating the story of Pippin and repeatedly promising a finale you will never forget.Miller starred in Sister Act  on Broadway, a woeful show that I felt she somehow rose
above. Perhaps the shadow of that Fosse choreography (here the choreography is byChet Walker "in the style of Bob Fosse") and Vereen's legendary turn have frozen her.
Miller's steely charm in Sister Act  now seems just like icy reserve. You feel she's</p>
<p>mechanically recreating someone else's performance rather than delivering her own
and the result is a chilly, charismatic-free vacuum at the heart of the show.
Pippin is no help since he's a bland, petulant teenager, who whines like college
students everywhere that he wants to do something meaningful with his life. On theother hand, he doesn't want to do any actual work either, proves incompetent atrunning the government when given the chance, feels constrained by home life whentaken in by a widow with a son and frankly looks bored to tears by a night of
debauchery. This Pippin doesn't look remotely interested in any women (or men)
during the "sexy" scenes of him drinking and drugging and exploring the pleasures of
the flesh. Pippin is at heart a neutered, bland character and that naturally drags the
show down.
Truly, it's hard to discuss such a half-hearted plot. There's a brief storyline that the
king's new wife (Charlotte d'Ambroise) wants to supplant Pippin and place her son onthe throne, but the issue is raised and then nothing comes of it. Pippin takes one trulydecisive action -- he kills his father the King (a by-the-numbers Terrence Mann)because he believes the king is corrupt and the system needs to be changed. Butthen after a very brief bit of political satire, the show just brings the king back to lifeand pretends it never happened. Pippin rejects the comforts of home life but thenlongs for it again, a reversal that might have more impact if it didn't happen practicallyin the same breath.
Pippin  has one saving grace and it's Andrea Martin. She has a show-stopping turn as
Pippin's grandmother Berthe. Martin tells Pippin to have a little fun for goodness sake
and then sings the inspirational, times-a-wastin' song "No Time At All." It's presented
as a sing-along and Martin -- a legend from SCTV  in top form - has fun playing with
the audience in a no-brainer of a part. But it's when she gets on a trapeze and starts
dangling above the audience AND keeps singing that the 66 year old brings the house
down.
Throughout the show, the Leading Player interrupts the action and others -- such as
the widowed farmwife (Rachel Bay Jones) -- choose not to follow the script. It allbuilds to the big finale where all the artifice on display is stripped away, the circus tentis pulled down and we're just left with a bare stage. It's meant to be shocking, ofcourse, but you can't strip away an illusion when it never dazzled you in the firstplace.

THE PEARL THEATRE COMPANYWhen Signature Theatre Company moved to its new home on 42nd St. between ninth
and tenth avenue, one had to feel a little sad about the fate of its home farther downthe block between tenth and eleventh. It's a wonderful space with a great, intimatetheater and thanks to Signature it was bursting with happy memories of excellentshows.
Perhaps the perfect new tenant moved in to carry on the tradition. The Pearl Theatre
Company proves again with this diverting entertainment why all theater buffs and
casual fans should take a trip to their ideal new home.
This Side Of Neverland  features two trim, entertaining one-acts by J.M. Barrie, the
author of Peter Pan . He had a string of successes and they're very much of a piece if
these two are any indication. Rosalind  shows a famed actress enjoying her anonymity
in a seaside town where she can act her age, only to have her cover spoiled by an
ardent young fan. The Twelve Pound Look  features a man about to be knighted who
discovers his ex-wife has turned up as a secretary to help write the voluminous thankyou notes the great day will entail. Each play is narrated by Barrie, each employs amodest twist, and each is a pleasing diversion with some subtle social commentary.
Before the show, the audience is treated to sing-alongs of period tunes like "After The
Ball" and "I'm Always Chasing Rainbows" to create the proper old-timey feel. DirectorJ.R. Sullivan captures the right tone, allowing for lots of humor but without losing sightof the serious subtext (aging, the role of women and so on) that makes them just alittle more than silly.
Rachel Botchan goes a bit broadly as the actress Mrs. Page in the first piece. But she
was terrific in the second piece as Kate, a woman who chose to leave her husbandfor a sense of independence and self-worth. Botchan was appealing and smart and
funny and I retrospectively upgraded my impression of her performance in the first
one. If she could be this subtle and believable here then obviously she was choosingto be a bit actress-y in the first one. The rest of the cast was solid in supporting turnswith one happy exception. In multiple roles -- the narrator J.M. Barrie, a servant and abefuddled young blue blood in love with the actress -- Sean McNall shinesthroughout. He deftly created three very different roles all while slipping back andforth between one and the other.
The only off note was a costume choice by Elise M. VanderKley. The actress in the</p>
<p>first piece revels in being frumpy but she's given a potato sack of a dress that is
distractingly absurd. A more realistic frock would have been better. Instead it's so
bulky and bizarre that it took quite a while to figure out the tone of the piece and whatexactly is going on. Costumes that go for jokey effects rarely succeed. It didn't helpthat her more glamorous costume at the finale was underwhelming as well. SinceBotchan looked so much more appealing in the second piece, it's a pity hertransformation wasn't more fun in the first.
That's a modest complaint about a night that was well-judged from start to finish. At
about 90 minutes, even the decision not to include a third one act was smart; it makes
the evening a refreshing, lively and quick diversion that is as good an introduction as
any to this company celebrating its 29th season.
A PUBLIC READING OF AN UNPRODUCED SCREENPLAY ABOUT THE DEATH
OF WALT DISNEY  *** out of ****
SOHO REP
Just a few months ago, I saw my first play by Lucas Hnath. Isaac's Eye  was ambitious
and smart and funny and has stayed with me. Now with this new show and the
acclaim his earlier work has received, it's clear Hnath is a fascinating talent we'll behearing from for years to come.
This play with it's Kushner-like title is exactly as advertised: four actors sit at a table
and do a staged reading of what purports to be a screenplay about the movie mogul
and theme park visionary Walt Disney.
It focuses on Walt (Larry Pine); his brother Roy (Frank Wood), who always labored
under Walt's shadow; his daughter (Amanda Quaid) and her ex-football player of a
husband Ron (Brian Sgambati). Anyone familiar with Disney's life in even broad terms
-- or indeed with the life of any self-made mogul -- won't be surprised here. Disney is
more focused on work than family, pushes around Roy, manipulates others, confuses
success with infallibility and late in life comes up with grandiose schemes that the
very company he created is unwilling to back.
The play takes liberties with facts, such as the apparent myth surrounding Walt
choosing to freeze his own head via cryogenics, an infamous Oscar-winning naturedocumentary that was partially staged (Hnath has Roy take the fall when it wasn'teven an issue until after they were both dead) and so on. But the heart of it rings true,including Walt's growing obsession with his planned city, a great anecdote about atree at Walt Disney World he had to accommodate and the back and forth betweensiblings or parents and children captured with ease.
In smaller roles, Quaid and Sgambati are good. Quaid shines especially in her one
big monologue where she explains why she doesn't want to name her son "Walt" afterher father. It's the most emotionally devastating scene of the show but she wiselydoesn't oversell it. Sgambati is an eager beaver of a son-in-law, not too bright but heknows it and is willing to work hard and learn any lessons Walt is wiling to teach.
But it's Wood and Pine that have the most fun. Wood is excellent as the reasonable,
doormat of a man Roy. And Pine is superb as Walt, a driven, unhappy fellow.Whether badgering Roy, disdaining Ron, quietly pushing his daughter or extolling hisdream of the Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow, Pine captures theself-assured but insecure nature of a man used to having his way and being right sooften he's forgotten that he can ever be wrong.
Director Sarah Benson oversees the work with an attention to detail that keeps the
many shifts in mood and scene crystal clear, aided by fine tech work all around. ButHnath missed the opportunity to craft a genuine screenplay. That conceit never reallytakes life. Other than scene changes and occasional references to the camera doinga close up and then moving in even closer on certain characters, the stage directionsamount mostly to characters saying "cut to" to move a scene forward a few minutes. Itcreates an interesting rhythm that Pine mines fully towards the climax.
But it keeps the disparate elements from coming into focus. It's a rather scattershot
screenplay, jumping from that nature documentary about lemmings to bouts with hischild to repeated pleas by Walt to make the planned city of his imagination come tolife. Before you know it, he's dead and we barely feel like we've found our bearings.As good as each scene is, the format of reading a screenplay can't hide the fact thatthese scenes have not been shaped into a coherent whole. It all takes place during
the last ten years of Walt's life but still a tighter, clearer throughline would have
helped.
And a screenplay should be visual. Imagine if Hnath had actors delivering descriptions
of images, of camera movements and entire scenes that didn't include dialogue butadvanced the story and revealed character in ways that couldn't be told any otherway. If it doesn't do that, it's not really a screenplay. Instead, the screenplay hereremains merely an idea. Happily, with this group of actors and the scenes at hand,Walt does come to life. Now he just needs a more structured, more visual screenplay</p>
<p>from the talented Hnath to give him the show he deserves.
