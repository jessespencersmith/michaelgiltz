6/22/2005 11:25:00 AMWhen Kansas held hearings on the "debate" between evolutionand "intelligent design" (ie. the Bible), a curious thinghappened according to the New York Times. Most majorscience organizations refused to take part. Their reasoning issound, but I don't know if I agree. In short, the National Centerfor Science Education, top textbook authors and others saidshowing up would reinforce a lie.1. There is NO debate in the scientific community on"intelligent design," which has had decades to inspire someresearch or findings and proven empty.2. You can't debate faith -- the people arguing for intelligentdesign are not scientists, are unwilling to accept any otherpoint of view and therefore will never admit they're wrong.3. The scientific community has spent the last few decadesappearing with these groups, taking them on scientifically,proving why their crackpot ideas hold no water and nothingchanges -- so why appear?4. It's a waste of time in a political arena -- in this case, theyfigured the board had already decided to rule it was aninteresting debate and that kids deserved to hear about it inclass. They were right.Now I'm of two minds about this. NASA finally realized theyhad to weigh in on the basics of how man landed on the moonbecause crackpots arguing it was all fake had permeatedsociety and they realized that well-intentioned teachers didn'talways have the facts at hand to answer students' questions.Pretending idiots weren't out there (heck, the "hoax" evenmade it onto a primetime special on Fox) didn't make theproblem go away.In the same way, school boards all over the country -- well, atleast in the South -- keep holding hearings and its scary tothink the debate would be ceded to pseudo-scientists who canspout lots of complicated arguments that laymen aren'tequipped to handle.On the other hand, this really isn't a scientific debate, is it, sono one should need scientists to argue with these crackpots.Instead of getting into a discussion on evolution, maybesupporters of teaching science in science class should not playthat game. Detail all the subjects that supporters of intelligentdesign would like to see dropped or challenged -- astronomy,biology, archeology, geology, physics, and so on. Once peoplerealize it's not just one particular issue but science as a wholethey want to attack, people might wake up. Show how manychapters of a typical science book they'd like to rip up. Andtrips to the local planetarium are now out of bounds? Hold on,board members might say. Maybe emphasizing that they arecompletely unwilling to ever change their views makes it amatter of faith, not science. Maybe emphasizing that not asingle public university in the country teaches intelligent designas an alternative to evolution will get the point across -- whyare you trying to teach kids something that is rejected at everynon-Bible college in the country? Point out how not a singleatheist supports intelligent design? (But atheists are godless,so who cares what they think.) Argue that fringe theories are
