8/17/2004 10:00:00 AMHere's a damning NYT editorial about the reshuffling of our military.They argue that most of the moves (pulling troops out of Germanyand South Korea) weaken our alliances, will cost us money (Germanyapparently shoulders much of the cost of those troops), and gives upfreely something the North Koreans dearly wanted and might havemade concessions to achieve. In short, they argue that the mainpurpose of the reshuffling was not to realign the military for newrealities but to punish allies who disagreed with us on Iraq.
