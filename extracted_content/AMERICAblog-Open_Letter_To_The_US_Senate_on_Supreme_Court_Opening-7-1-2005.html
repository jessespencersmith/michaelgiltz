7/01/2005 04:10:00 PMTo: The US SenateFrom: Americablog/Michael in New YorkRe: The Supreme Court VacancyA vacancy has opened on the Supreme Court and your actionsin the next few weeks will determine not just judicial rulingsbut the lives of every American. I urge you to support thecandidacy of conservatives who are in the mainstream ofjudicial philosophy and can earn broad, bipartisan support andthus the support of the American people. You should do so forthree reasons: our nation is at war, our judicial system hasbeen under attack for years by radicals and needs shoring up,and following President Bush's lead on this issue would bepolitical suicide in the upcoming elections.First, our thanks to Sandra Day O'Connor. This conservativejustice would never have been nominated by a DemocraticPresident and her rulings have reflected that. But she has beena moderating influence on both sides of the Court, aninspiration to all Americans (especially women) and has rightlyearned the admiration and respect of her country.Anyone who would begin by ridiculing or attacking Sandra DayO'Connor's record is insulting to Ronald Reagan, the Presidentthat put her on the Court, offensive to women and paintsthemselves as so far out of the mainstream that their opinionsaren't worth listening to. Attacking an ill woman who hasserved her country faithfully for 24 years is the sort ofcowardly, indecent and radical behavior that has so polarizedthis country.Now, the three reasons the Senate should only support anominee who can enjoy broad, bipartisan support.1. Our nation is at war and bitterly divided -- young menand women are dying overseas. Our military is stretchedperilously thin. A majority of Americans believe the war was amistake and most Americans believe George Bush lied to themabout the reasons for invading Iraq. Our closest ally, GreatBritain, also believes Bush lied about why we invaded Iraq. Andthe "success story" of Afghanistan is turning into a narco-state(the number one supplier of heroin in the world) ruled mostlyby drug lords and the Taliban. With these great and difficulttasks ahead of us, shouldn't the Congress use this opportunityto bring the country together, rise above the politics of personalattack and support a nominee for the Supreme Court thateveryone agrees is in the broad mainstream of judicialphilosophy? We have too many important problems to conquer.Why create more problems by trying to push through a fringecandidate with radical thinking that will increase the poisonousatmosphere of Washington?2. Our judicial system is under attack -- for years, peopleon the far right have been attacking the judiciary and treatingit as an annoyance or even unpatriotic branch of thegovernment. (Do those on the far right really think they'resmarter than the Founding Fathers like Jefferson and Hamilton
