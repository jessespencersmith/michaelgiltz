<p>TRUE GRIT  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular DVD; Paramount) -- The Coen Brothers movie is solid
fun that's better than the original and more true to the terrific novel by Charles Portis. Hailee Steinfeld
gives a funny but very particular performance that could be the sign of a singular talent or a one-offstunt. Josh Brolin is hissable as the villain. Jeff Bridges shamelessly chews the scenery in the hammy role
made famous by John Wayne. But I want to talk about Matt Damon.
He gives the best performance of the film as the over-confident Texas Ranger LaBoeuf. The character is
nominally comic relief, but Damon makes him the heart of the movie. The little girl is preternaturallycalm and mature. Bounty hunter Cogburn is a caricature of the hard-drinking frontierman. Only LaBoeufis a recognizable human being, a man who is a tad vain but at heart a decent person. Damon gets all thehumor out of this easily offended young man but he also makes you care about LaBoeuf and consequentlyabout the film as a whole. If anyone might die in this enterprise you fear it would be LaBoeuf, so all thesuspense and drama centers on whether he'll make it home alive or at least redeem himself as a braveand valued companion. With his accustomed ease, Damon steals the show by playing a supporting role
that other movie stars might not deign to accept.
It's just the latest achievement by one of the best actors working today. Damon's looks always promise the
square-jawed decency of a 1950s leading man. But his talent often lies in subverting our expectations. Hebroke through as the math whiz in Good Will Hunting  of course. Then came Saving Private Ryan,  with
Damon as every mother's son caught in the dangers of war. His career seemed set as a traditional hero.But Damon followed that immediately with one of his best and most underrated turns. He became almostinvisible in The Talented Mr. Ripley , a mousy killer who subsumes the identity of the people he destroys.
Look at the way Damon maintains the anonymous demeanor of a servant in the opening scenes andyou'll see a movie star choosing to become an actor.
He showed he had charisma to burn in the Ocean's Eleven  movies. But it's the Bourne  trilogy that has
truly vaulted Damon to the top. If comedies get little respect, even they receive more critical attention
than the performances in action films. Damon's work in the Bourne  movies constitutes one of the best
action performances on film, equal to Harrison Ford's work in the early Indiana Jones movies and easilyone of the most complex achievements in the genre. Damon delivers the confusion and apprehension of aman who finds a terrified release in the violence he is so clearly capable of achieving, a violence that boththrills and disturbs him. With a minimum of dialogue and often through his face and body movementsalone, Damon creates a man audiences live vicariously through but also pity in his desperate desire toknow exactly who he is. Best of all, Damon showed the rare restraint of walking away from the franchisebefore it became repetitive and dumb.
The smart choices continued: the CIA agent in The Good Shepherd,  the gangster turned cop in The
Departed  (proving again how good Damon is at internal conflict) and the hilariously inept stool pigeon in
The Informant! . That's a very funny movie but Damon's gifts as a comic haven't been fully exploited yet
(despite his amusing work on 30 Rock ), any more than his ability to be a romantic lead. Presumably that
just doesn't interest him since he's barely assayed such a common, almost inevitable role. Politics
interests him more, from the complex Syriana to T he Green Zone  to his work as the narrator of the best
documentary of 2010, Inside Job.
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of Damon's talent is that he's only seemed to scratch the surface of
what he's capable of doing. The older he gets, the more interesting and varied the roles he should be ableto tackle. Damon's never been trapped by leading man status but growing more mature will only play into

<p>his natural instinct for the interesting and off-beat. Unquestionably, the best is yet to come.
ALSO OUT NOW:
BREAKING BAD: THIRD SEASON  ($49.96 BluRay or $39.95 regular DVD; Sony) -- The best show
on TV right now, bar none. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes
to this terrific ensemble. Three seasons in and they haven't even come close to skipping a beat yet. The
new season starts July 17 and you have no excuses for not catching up.
AC/DC LET THERE BE ROCK  ($44.98 BluRay or $34.98 regular DVD; Warner Bros.) -- Finally, after
years of waiting, the most enduring hard rock band in the world gets their concert film released on DVD.
Modest extras -- a nice tin case, some silly photo cards, videos of journalists and other musicians telling
us that AC/DC totally rocks! and the like -- make this a deluxe edition. All you really want is the movie
turned up loud.
ANOTHER YEAR  ($36.98 BluRay; Sony Pcitures Classics) -- A heartbreaking look at a single woman
entering middle age who realizes her friends -- heck, even her friends' children -- have lives and lovers
while she is alone and apparently will be for the rest of her life. A gem from director Mike Leigh and oneof the best movies of 2010.
A CLOCKWORK ORANGE  ($34.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- It's no revelation,but watching this
disturbing drama again, I was struck by director Stanley Kubrick's remarkable eye and how he makes
scene after scene come alive with fresh and unexpected visual approaches. Loads of substantial extrasinclude career retrospectives of both Kubrick and his star Malcolm McDowell.
CARANCHO  ($27.99; Strand) -- This political thriller from Argentina tells the story of an ambulance
chasing attorney who falls hard for a young female doctor who works the emergency room. They find the
courage to put themselves in harms way and challenge the corruption all around. An unappreciatedcorker that shows how dangerous true love can be -- it makes you ashamed of behaving poorly in yourlover's eyes when compromise is so much safer and easier.
SPECTACLE -- ELVIS COSTELLO WITH... SEASON TWO  ($39.95 BluRay or $29.95 regular
DVD; MVD) -- Costello's very enjoyable music and chat series (where artists sit together on stage and
swap stories and songs) had a very good season two with Bono, Ron Sexsmith, Bruce Springsteen, SherylCrow, Richard Thompson and the like. Loads of bonus material but none of it changes the fact that thehighpoint was Jesse Winchester's instant classic performance of "Sham-A-Ling-Dong-Ding," one of theloveliest tunes you'll ever hear.
DUCK SOUP  ($19.98; Universal) -- The Marx Brothers are one of movie's greatest pleasures and their
string of "animal" pictures ( Horse Feathers, Monkey Business, Animal Crackers, Duck Soup  plus The
Cocoanuts  in this reissue) are considered their screen peak with Duck Soup  the peakiest of the peaks. It's
delirious fun, though the prints are nothing special and the extras non-existent. If you already own them,
don't bother. If you don't already own them, bother.
THE KIDS IN THE HALL: COMPLETE SERIES  ($99.95; A&E) -- Frankly, not that many groups
even get a chance to do sketch comedy on TV, so i suppose they all have their adherents. Dave Foley had
the best solo success ( NewsRadio ) but these five Canadians will be remembered for their work here,
which always maintained a sweetness at its core that most other sketch comedy troupes lacked. You getall five original seasons plus the reunion Death Comes To Town,  some 800 sketches on 22 DVDs and a
raft of memorable characters. Ranks alongside SCTV  as indispensable comedy.
