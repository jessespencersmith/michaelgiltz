'Man of the Year' co-star Lewis Black's 
ranting earns raves BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
omedian Lewis Black, whose lid-boiling-off-the-pot fulmi­
nations on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" have been 
part of the Comedy Central show since Craig Kilborn host­
ed it in the mid-'90s, co-stars as a political speechwriter in 
the satire "Man of the Year," which opened Friday. SPIN THE POUTICO lewis Black (center) guides Robin WIlliams In "Man of the Year" 
But something tells us he wouldn't 
have the temperament to dp that job in 
the real world. 
"I watched 'Meet the Press' this past 
Sunday," says Black in his staccato talk­
shout style, "and they had a debate [for 
a Senate seat]. 1 thought, you've got to 
be kidding! Those are the two best peo­
ple? ... the Republican senator was an id­
iot! Then the Democrats come up with a 
woman who ... they might as well have 
put her in a nun's outfit! 1 was stunned! 
You can see why AI Franken might run. 
You watch these people and think, why 
not? At least Ai's got a working intelli­
gence!" 
In "Man ofthe Year," written and 
directed by Barry Levinson ("Wag the 
Dog"), Robin WIlliams plays a politi­
cal satirist -it la Stewart or Bill Maher 
-who impulsively runs for President, then, thanks to grass-roots support and 
defective voting machines, wins. Black 
is the guy who puts words in Williams' 
mouth on the campaign trail, some-
thing the 58-year-old comic says 
he's been practicing for since 
high school, when he'd write 
campaign speeches for stu­
dents running for student 
office (on both sides). 
Bilt acting is the new 
spin for him, something 
he'd never really pursued de­
spite small roles in a handful 
of films and a degree from the "They fi.r}ally found me, I guess," jokes 
Black, who grew up in Maryland and 
now lives in HeU's Kitchen. "On a cou­
ple of movies, [my agent] would say, 
'They're interested in you, but 
they're also talking to Eugene 
Levy.' Hey, I'd choose Eugene 
Levy. I'd even choose Eu­
gene to play me!" 
Black's ranting on the 
"Back in Black" segments 
for "The Daily Show" upped 
his visibility. But his 2005 
book, "Nothing's Sacred," also 
helped, as did a Carnegie Hall B\ack savs 
neVismakers 
'Give us punch 
\\nes noW toor 
Yale School of Drama. Yet he's got a 
clutch of films out this year, including the , 
recent college goof" Accepted," "Man," 
1 the upcoming animated satire "Farce of 
the Penguins" and the holiday comedy 
"Unaccompanied Minors." show last year (it was captured for 
a CD, following comedy albums that in­
cluded "The End of the Universe" and 
"Rules of Enragement") . . 
Black thinks programs like Stewart's 
serve as a filter, helping people digest the massive amounts of news that pour out 
every day and focus on what matters. He 
thinks when the news media fail to ask 
the tough questions, comedians :noW step 
in to ask them -in an often silly \¥af,' 
"It used to be that [real life] gjlve uS 
the setups, and guys like me woUld write 
the punch lines," Black says. "[Now] they 
give us the punch lines too .... The joke 
is that now we reaUy have to tryand find 
the joke. They almost give us too much!" 
Ask Black to look at the paper and 
decide what story makes him angriest, 
he studies the front page and then says, 
resigned, "It's a tie." But he admits that 
nothing beats venting for a living. 
"I flip on CNN in the morning and go 
[crazy] for an hour," says Black. "It is a 
luxury -no matter what happens during 
the day, I'm then able to go onstage and 
just go nuts." •</p>
