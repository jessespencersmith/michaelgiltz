WHITE IRISH DRINKERS  *** out of ****
In theaters today
TV talent John Gray ( The Ghost Whisperer ) takes a
promising step into cinema with this solid coming-of-
age tale. Relative unknown Nick Thurston is very
appealing as Brian Leary, a sensitive young lad growing
up in the rough and tumble of Brooklyn in the 70s. Hisolder brother is a petty thief. But Brian works at thelocal cinema, convincing the owner to book rock actsfrom time to time, obsessively draws in his basementhideaway and fancies the local travel agent with a sharptongue but a friendly smile.

In...When Brian's boss unexpectedly pulls in a favor and arranges to have the Rolling Stones do a one-hour
concert in Brooklyn, everyone's dreams collide, with Brian's brother pushing him to rob the place and hisboss hoping to avoid a death sentence from the local hood he owes too much money. Melodrama mightintrude towards the end of White Irish Drinkers , but the acting is solid throughout and Thurston has a
low-key charm -- he could be the kid brother to Kevin Connolly's Eric on Entourage . But unlike a player
in Hollywood, Brian has to learn that he has a right to play the game in the first place. Sweet, unforced.
