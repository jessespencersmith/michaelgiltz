9/03/2005 10:52:00 AMCondi Rice -- who headed to New York City for a three dayvacation AFTER the hurricane struck and who went to aBroadway musical while the flood waters were rising andpeople were dying -- yes, this Condi Rice cut her vacation shortand headed back to DC. And now Queen Condi has deigned tospeak to us per the NYT with her concern that people areinjecting race into all of this.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in an unusual forayinto domestic affairs, sharply disputed any suggestion thatstorm victims had somehow been overlooked because oftheir race.... "That Americans would somehow in a color-affected way decide who to help and who not to help - Ijust don't believe it.""Color-affected way?" What a bland, annoying, clinical comment. Inpart, she's right: this isn't about race so much as class. And she hasnone. More importantly, why did the MSM let Condi speak withoutimmediately asking her "Where the hell have you been?"Condi should be asked again and again: when are you going toapologize for going on vacation to a splashy Broadway musicalcomedy AFTER the worst natural disaster in our nation's history?When are you going to apologize for shopping for obscenelyexpensive Ferragamo shoes when misery and despair was spreadingthrough the Gulf States? Why didn't you want to take part in theefforts to focus help ON YOUR HOME STATE OF ALABAMA? Alabama --the state where she grew up and where the divide between rich andpoor is deep and wide -- was struck viciously and Condi couldn't havecared less. Who are these people?
