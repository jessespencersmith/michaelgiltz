2/25/2005 12:27:00 PMThe Anglican Church -- still reeling from the decision to treatwomen as equal in the eyes of God -- is now breaking apartover the issue of gays. In an unprecedented move, the leadersof the Anglican communion have asked the US and Canadianchurches to "temporarily" withdraw members from a keyinternational governing body.In other words, in order to avoid splitting the Church, they'resplitting the Church. Finally, the rightist leaders who can't bearto have women leading service or working at the highest levelsof the church are getting their revenge on those wishy-washyleftists who believe all people are equal in the eyes of God.
