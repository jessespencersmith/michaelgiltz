            <p>Art Spiegelm ~ on r;rumb 
With the release of the documentary Crumb on April 21 
at Film Forum, legendary underground·comics artist 
Robert Crumb finally receives the aHention he de· 
serves-but by no means wants. "From what I've heard," says Art 
Spiegelman, the creator of Maus and an acquaintance of Crumb's 
for nearly 30 years; "Robert's ready to change his name and go in· 
to hiding because of this film." Small wonder. Though his work has 
always seemed bracingly honest-detailing Crumb's misogynistic 
sexual fantasies and seH·mocking aHitude-director Terry Zwigoff 
has plumbed Crumb's dark 
childhood, revealing an abu· 
sive, domineering father; a pre· 
scription·pill·addicted mother; 
and two artistically gifted but 
exceptionally troUbled broth· 
ers. For Spiegelman, the expe· 
rience of watching a film to find 
out personal details about 
someone he'd known for so 
many years was an odd one. 
"Crumb's always been a very 
closed·off guy," he says, "so 
I've known him, but his way of 
socializing in a group is to hide 
himseH in a sketchbook and draw while other people are talking." 
The resuH of that focus is a complex and significant body of work 
that traffics in racial and sexual stereotypes without ever offering 
a reader the comfort of knowing the creator doesn't really mean it. 
"Cartoon language is buiH on stereotypes," says Spiegelman, 
whose own work has recently been accused of insensitivity, "and 
Crumb's cartoons relish those stereotypes in a very kind of mean· 
spirited way, one could say if one wanted to pass judgment. There 
are racist and sexist characters really central to the work. The 
misanthropic aspects of that are more understandable after see­
ing the movie. Robert's a genius. He's a central and important fig· 
ure in the history of comics, certainly one of our most important 
cartoonists alive now." MICHAEl elLTZ</p>
