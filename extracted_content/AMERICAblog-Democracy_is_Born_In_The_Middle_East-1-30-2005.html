1/30/2005 09:02:00 PMI did not support Bush's unilateral invasion of Iraq (but Ithought the UN should have gone in there YEARS ago). Butwhatever you think of the war, anyone with a heart has to beinspired by seeing people flocking to the polls in Iraq,apparently at the same level as voters here in the US -- andwhen they are risking their lives to do so. It is inspiring to seewomen proudly displaying their ink-stained fingers that indicatethey too were able to vote. Even some Sunni areas saw strongnumbers of voters. If the dominant Shiites and Kurds canactually maintain a pluralistic, secular government -- ratherthan taking revenge on the Sunnis who dominated them forages -- it will be a miracle of decency. Arab news channels --according to the NYT -- were filled with images of the historicvote going out to the entire Middle East. Our "allies" --strategic partners who share none of our values, like Egypt andSaudi Arabia -- are deeply, deeply disturbed by this. Good.Yes, the country is still riven by violence and 1/5th of thepopulation is deeply hostile to the new leaders and ourpresence. Yes, the infrastructure is a mess. Yes, Afghanistanhad elections and now only a few major cities are controlled bythe "good guys" while a third of the country is back under theheels of the Taliban and another third dominated by drug lords.But people want to be free -- whether they live in China orNorth Korea or Iran or Egypt. People want to be free -- despitea thousand year history of sectarian hatred and religiousfanaticism, Iraqis risked their lives to go to the polls. We shouldbe happy. And God willing today may be the day they start toconsider themselves Iraqis instead of Kurds or Sunni or Shiite.I almost put a question mark at the end of the headline --Democracy is Born in the Middle East? But I don't think there'sany question.
