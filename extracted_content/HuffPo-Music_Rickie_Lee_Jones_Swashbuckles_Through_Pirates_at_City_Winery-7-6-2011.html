 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyMusic: Rickie Lee Jones
Swashbuckles Through "Pirates" atCity Winery
RICKIE LEE JONES  ** 1/2 out of ****
CITY WINERY
RICKIE LEE JONES -- LIVE IN STOCKHOLM ($24.98;Megaforce)
Fans at City Winery  enjoyed hearing Jones perform her
classic debut and the acclaimed followup Pirates , which
came out 30 years ago this month. But why are so many
acts from new bands to enduring talents like Rickie LeeJones  deciding to perform albums in their entirety
during a concert? Lots of reasons and all of them makesense.
One, it's a rebellion against the shuffle mode on music
MP3 players.
Two, it makes a concert special, not just a random selection of a few new tracks, some greatest hits and a
a handful of obscurities and covers like so many shows in the past.
Three, it reestablishes the album as an art form. It's great that digital music allows artists to release EPs
and singles whenever the mood strikes. But the idea that the album is dead is just silly. Creating a groupof songs meant to be heard in a certain order at one sitting has been around for decades. (I nominateFrank Sinatra as one of the first to pioneer and certainly perfect the idea.) Just because singles arehappily back in fashion doesn't mean the album is over, any more than the fact that a new market

<p>opening up for short stories would mean novels were permanently passe.
It was a treat for fans with Jones -- getting over the flu and laughingly telling us she was on speed or
wouldn't have been able to make it -- first performing Pirates  and then her eponymous debut, by and
large.
The show began creakily with 15 minutes of footage from her new DVD Rickie Lee Jones -- Live In
Stockholm.  It was random footage when at least they might have played some complete songs they
anticipated would NOT be performed in the concert we were about to see. Plus, it would have been nice ifthis was screened before the 8 p.m. start time. Maybe only Rickie Lee Jones could open up for Rickie Lee
Jones but this promo should not have delayed the start of the concert, which is how it felt. That said, the
concert is blessedly low on quick-cutting, Jones is in fine form and it has a healthy dose of more than 2
and a half hours of content overseen by director Ian McCrudden.
After that, the show proper began at 8:30 but it was not smooth sailing. Two songs in, Jones wondered
what the next number was on Pirates  she was due to perform. "Skeletons!" numerous people shouted out
hopefully. "'Skeletons' it is," she answered gamely, going on to deliver a sad little story about breaking upwith a guy who left her in a house filled with fan mail where she wrote this tune.
Jones fiddled with the sound, dealt with an annoying audience member who insisted on trying to talk
directly to Jones but cutting him to the quick with a choice curse word (though unfortunately the
schmuck will probably dine out on the tale for years), directed the band, grooved to her excellent horn
section, told a rambling disjointed tale about being arrested on July 4th in 1970 and generally cut adistinctive, strong-willed figure as an artist not quite feeling it that night but still delivering the goods.
Are you done eating, she asked early on, since City Winery  serves meals, encouraging fans to arrive early
and eat up long before the show begins. "Finish up!" she said half amusingly, half commandingly. "I don't
like to sing for people who are eating." Who would? Telling a story about getting arrested at the borderfor not wearing a bra (so she says) led right into a righteous version of her signature first hit "Chuck E.'sIn Love" and a string of tunes from that stellar debut.
it may be easier to celebrate those early successes since her most recent album Balm In Gilead  was a
distinct return to form I considered one of the best albums of 2009.  No need to rest on her laurels for
Jones. Despite a lingering bug, her voice was its usual distinctive affair, with Jones playing with her
distance from the microphone to dramatic effect, especially when bringing the band to silence andhypnotizing the crowd with her sung-spoken lyrics at the finale. Anyone without her classic debut ormid-period masterpiece Flying Cowboys  (I'd love to attend the show when she performs that on July 6
or 7th at City Winery ) is missing out on some great work by a genuine original.
And while this concert was not one for the ages, no one would ever accuse the crankily alive Jones ofsleepwalking through a set. She was present and accounted for, even if her fans didn't always give her thequiet attention she deserved.

Telling VolunteersNOTE: Why don't venues -- especially ones that cater to a sit-down crowd like  City Winery  -- ban ALL
photography and recording during a show? They made an announcement at the beginning, but no
waiters or waitresses interfered as patrons repeatedly lifted their cell phones into the air and took picture
after picture. Even if the flash is off (and it wasn't always), no artist wants to sing to a cell phone and the
cameras are incredibly distracting to everyone sitting behind those clueless shutterbugs. Further, if I were
an artist, I'd encourage everyone to whip out their phones and cameras and FlipVideos and say, "Okay,take all the images you want during this first song. Go crazy! Then put them all away for the rest of theshow. Alright?" Let people get their snap and then shame them into not messing with everyone'spleasure for the rest of the night. Just a thought.
