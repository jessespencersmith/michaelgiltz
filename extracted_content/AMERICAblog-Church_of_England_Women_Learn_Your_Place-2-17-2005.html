2/17/2005 01:59:00 PMDon't be surprised that major religions are struggling with gaymarriage and gay priests. For most of them, even womenpriests are still a radical and divisive idea. The Church ofEngland (the British mother church for Episcopalians) is stillstruggling with its decision to let more than half the population-- women -- be priests. In just a few years, 1 out of 5 priestsare now women, but some 500 parishes still refuse to haveanything to do with them.Now, the Church is embroiled in another dispute: since womenare now priests, obviously they should be eligible to becomebishops. The General Synod voted yet again to continuediscussions, whch means that possibility is one step closer. Buttraditonalists (also known as narrow-minded idiots) arethreatening a schism.One supporter of women told the Independent in UK quitereasonably, "The vast majority of church members wantwomen bishops. Excluding half the human race is increasinglyembarrassing."So when you're astonished that suggesting gay people are thechildren of God still creates major agita, remember that womenare treated as second class citizens by virtually every majorreligion in the world.
