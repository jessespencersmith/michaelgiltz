10/12/2004 01:32:00 AMPaul Krugman of the New York Times beats Bush to the punch bydetailing the distortions and lies he believes Bush will repeat onWednesday night. He details seven items, so any college students(who aren't driving) can have fun taking a chug every time Bushrepeats one of these lies anyway. Then Krugman writes almost wordfor word the argument I've been repeating to my brother all thisweek."By singling out Mr. Bush's lies and misrepresentations, am I sayingthat Mr. Kerry isn't equally at fault? Yes."Mr. Kerry sometimes uses verbal shorthand that offers nitpickersthings to complain about. He talks of 1.6 million lost jobs; that's theprivate-sector loss, partly offset by increased governmentemployment. But the job record is indeed awful. He talks of the $200billion cost of the Iraq war; actual spending is only $120 billion so far.But nobody doubts that the war will cost at least another $80 billion.The point is that Mr. Kerry can, at most, be accused of using looselanguage; the thrust of his statements is correct."Mr. Bush's statements, on the other hand, are fundamentallydishonest. He is insisting that black is white, and that failure issuccess. Journalists who play it safe by spending equal time exposinghis lies and parsing Mr. Kerry's choice of words are betraying theirreaders."
