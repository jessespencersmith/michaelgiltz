n the new movie "A Guide to Recog­
nizing Your Saints," opening Friday, 
actor Chazz Palminten plays Monty 
Montiel, a gruff fa tber in Queens 
who doesn't know how to keep his 
slightly wUd son Oito safe orher than 
to hold him light'er and tighter until 
~ he's squeezing the life out of the kid. 
~ "His whole world revolved around 
his SOri,"cSays Palminlen aboulthe father 
dewcted ill director pito Montiel's auto­
biograpl:lical lale. "Even though I had a 
great relationShip wi.th my dad. I under­
stood it. I saw fathers like that. Oito's dad 
is much older than him. People thought 
he was his grandfather ." 
Whether Palminteri is facing off 
against the young Oito (played by Shia 
LaBeouf) or the adult Oito (Robert 
Downey Jr.) who has returned home to 
try and convince his ailing father to go to 
the hospital, he gives it the same intensity 
that Palminteri brought to the story of his 
own life, retold on stage and in film. 
"J felt I knew these people, this world:' 
says the 54-year-old New Yorker. "It re­
minded me of 'A Bronx Tale:" the play 
and screenplay Palminteri wrote about 
his own upbringing . He starred in the 
1993 film. "It was like 'A Queens Tale_'" 
But people who think they know Pal­
minteri are always being surprised. He 
followed "Bronx" ~ a gasp of air after a 
long time working blue-collar jobs and 
writing at night to feed his art -with 
an Academy Award-nominated turn in Actor'Chazz 
Palminteri is 
far-from holy 
in 'Saints" .

;. : " ' '" \' '" .': "". ",,, :;":,;,,'-" ,~, i~'(";,,' 
Woody Allen's comedy "Bullets Over 
Broadway." Since then he has done every­
thing from "The Usual Suspects" to "Ana­
lyze This" to "Stuart little" and the 1V se­
ries remake of "Kojak" with Ving Rhames. 
And while it sounds like a "Saturday 
Night live" skit, Palminteri 's roots in the 
cover band Razzamachazz are pulling 
him back toward music. He has been de­
veloping a musical version of "A Bronx 
Tale" with songWriter Jimmy Webb for 
several years. An upcoming film -"The 
Dukes" -involves the members of an ag­
ing doo-wop group that was on the top of 
the world when they were 17. And Pal­
minteri is premiering his new theatrical 
piece "My Life in Song" at Lorenzo's Cab­
aret on Staten Island on Oct. 14. 
"Music is very important to me," says 
Palminteri. "This show is very differ­
ent. U's like 'A Bronx Tale' but done in 
a very different way. I'll sing songs from 
all different eras, songs like George Ben­
son's 'On Broadway' and Van Morrison's 
'Moondance: while telling the story of 
my life.". 
And until that begins, he'll be helping 
Montiel tell the story of his life in "Saints." 
"I love working with young. first-time 
directors:' says Palminteri . "They're feel­
ers. They'll do anything, try anything . 
They don't know any better!" • DAD OR ALIVE

Is a tough father 
In "A Guide to 
Recognizing 
Your Saints." 
ecognizing' his dreams Astoria'S Dlto Montiel tumoo 
a wild childhood into it movie· 
KEEPING n' REAL Director Dlto Montiel (I.) with Rob­
ert Downey Jr., who plays him, on location In Queens. f you made a movie about most people's life, you'd 
have 10 spice it up to keep things interesting. for 
New Yorker Diro Monliel, bebad to keep taking 
things our because nO One would believe iI. 
Montiel was.l.he lead singer of Guttc.rboy ,the self­I described "most su cessfuJ unsucces fal band in 
the world." (They signed a re.poned $1 million deal with 
Geffen Records and then gleefully imploded 011 tour.) 
Then Montiel turned his adventures -gro\ving up in 
Queens, unwiltingly turning away Am!y Warhol at the 
Palladium when he was a doorman, hangingwith pho­
tographer Bruce Weber and poet Allen Ginsberg -into 
the rambling, kaleidoscopic memoir called "A Guide to 
RecogniZi ng Your Saints." 
Now the 36-year-old Montiel has turned thaI book 
into a movie that focus'es On one key summer of his 
chlldhuod, and his adult return to the neighborhood 
to confront his ailing father. It stars Chazz Palminteri 
as Montiel's dad, DIanne Wiest as his morn, Robert 
Downey Jr. as the dult Dito, Shia LeBeouf as yOW'lg 
Olto and Channing Tal'um (orlhe summer hit "Step Up") 
as Dito's volcanic friend Antonio. It has already won 
awards for Dramatic Directing and a SpeCJaI Jury Award 
for Be.st Ensemble at Sundance. The movie, openingFri ­
day, has been a homecoming in more ways than one. 
"I love Ast.oria," says Montiel, who just moved back into the neighborhood \vilh h.is girlfrienc:l II was r emark­
ably easy to find a new home.just as it was easy to get 
the streets to look like the early '80s of his childhooc:l 
"Besides taking out Some ATM SIgns. ii's a bit of a 
r.ime"'ss place: he continues . "II reminds me of when 1 
wa a kid. My friend came out of ja.i\ and I walked hlm 
around and howed him how everything had changed . 
He said, 'It looks I he same.' Now I've come back and 
everyone says how it's changec:llt looks the same. It's 
a timeless place to me_I really love il; I always have 
loved it." 
Monriel says he used to caU the blocks between 1 <lth 
St. and 42nd St. in Manhan8'l"the desen." Now it's 
filled wilh Starbuck.s and Gaps. . 
·1 kind of liked the linle shops selling all sorts of dead­
ly weapons and boo.ks like 'How \0 Kill:" ays Montiel. 
"Bull know U,e weirdness never goes completely away. 
It just gets pushed around." 
As for Montiel. he never planned to be in a rock band 
or work as a fashion model for Weber and Versace; he 
never expected 10 write a book and he certainly never 
thought about directing a movie. Not surprisUlgly . he 
has no plans for a "!le.,,! move.' 
"I didn'l do any of Ihis [0 have a career: says 
Montiel. "This movie came out exactly like I wanted II 
to. That makes me happy." M.G. ~ a.
