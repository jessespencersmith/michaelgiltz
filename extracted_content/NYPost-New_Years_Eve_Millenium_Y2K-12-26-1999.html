h~;~;;.ntinreoorded 10 Y2K Day We're all going to watch 
TV at the same time, 
The most watched televi-
sion event in history was . 
once the moon landing. 
Then it was -by some 
accounts -"Who Shot 
J.R?" 
Later it was the O.J, 
Simpson verdict. 
JUter next weekend , the 
most watched television 
event in history will be the 
massive coverage ofY2K­
the first sunrise, the first 
birth, the first ATM failure 
and every other millennial 
event TV crews can capture 
on vidl.'Otape. 
Literally billions of peo­
ple wi II watch some (or 
all?) of the three days of 
coverage starting Friday 
morning and.running -if 
that is the right word -
through Saturday night. 
Bringing that sometimes 
exhilarating, sometimes 
tendentious mix of news 
and entertainment ("Yes, 
Papua, New Guinea, has 
JUST hit midnight!') is the 
most ambitious undertak­
ing in TV history. 
ABC and PBS are the 
most zealous, with round­
the-clock coverage from all 
over the world. ABC says 
it's been planning this 
event for 10 years; PBS for 
three. 
But every TV station 
around the world -from 
local affiliates in Indiana to 
TV Asashi in Japan -will 
put every available 
reporter on the streets to 
grab whatever the magic 
moment offers. 
Camera crews will be nium.) At the pyramids in

TVSundav .., 
The last Elvis sighting 
of the millennium ... 
and other really important stuff 
Tv is ready to cover 
Y2K meltdowns, riotli 
in the streets and even 
the Second Coming. 
But unlike the rollover 
from 1999 to 2000, net­
works can't really COUll t on 
any of those excitingly 
newsworthy events actual­
ly taking place. 
So, just to be safe, they've 
lined up proven ratings 
grabbers : musical super­
stars, marathon s of classic 
TV shows, and of course 
Dick Clark in Times 
Square for ABC's "Rockin' 
New Year's Eve." 
Here are some of the 
other highlights channel 
surfers can catch during 
the three-day fest. 
-Jay Leno may be 
ahead in the ratings, but 
it's David Letterman who's 
being treated like a VlP 
this year. 
Leno's "Tonight Show" is 
reduced to just his mono­
logue and a sketch before 
NBC cuts back to Times 
Square and well-known 
funny man Tom Brokaw. 
Letterman, on the other 
hand, gets his own lavish, 
two-hour primetime spe­
cial. 
-The cleverest mara­
thon idea has to go to the 
Discovery Channel, which 
is hosting round-the-clock 
specials devoted to bugs -
but not the Y2K kind, just 
the squishy, there-are-a­
lot-more-of-them-than-us 
kind. 
Other familiar marathon 
standbys include "Andy 
Griffith" on TBS, "Twilight 
Zone" on Sci-Fi and the 
Three Stooges on AMC. 
-MTV's reckless young 
audience apparently has 
no fear: Lucky contest win­
ners will jump on a "Fly 
2K" plane to jet over to Cairo, Paris, Rome and 
London when their parents 
are nervously avoiding air­
line travel like the plague. 
MTV will also host an 
eight-hour Times Square 
bash from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m., 
featuring Puff Daddy, 
Bush, Blink 182 and oth­
ers. 
-Nickelodeon's even 
younger audience is being 
treated more thoughtfully : 
They1l watch a commer­
cial-free 24-hour documen­
tary with kids all over the 
world discussing their 
hopes for the new millenni­
um. 
-A similarly weighty 
tone will pop up on Pax 
(with its quietly religious 
tone perfect for focusing on 
the spiritual celebrations 
in Rome and elsewhere) 
and PBS (where composer 
Tan Dun's "2000 Today -
A World Symphony for the 
Millennium" serves as the 
official theme song). 
-The History Channel is 
a safe haven for the pop­
star-weary. It will broad­
cast the "Mega Millennium 
Marathon ,' 37 hours of 
episodes from series like 
"The Century: America's 
Time" and "The Times 
Capsule.' 
-Anyone who can't wait 
for new episodes of "Who 
Wants to be a Millionaire" 
should tune in to the Game 
Show Network: It's focwt­
iog on the last day of the 
century by rebroadcasting 
the final episodes of shows 
like "Double Dare," "Super 
Password" and ·Card 
Sharks." 
-Finally, there's certain 
to be at least one Elvis 
sighting: Hell be on TCM, 
swiveling his hips through 
flicks like "Jailhouse Rock" 
and "Viva Las Vegas'"
