            <p>Ret e~J.ive • ultlmedla Welles 
he Voyager Company' s innovations with laserdiscs almost singlehandedly revitalized that moribund 
format. So Orson Welles-who revolutionized every medium he tackled_ould have enjoyed the fact 
that this multimedia company's entire history can be traced through his work. In 1984, Voyager 
kicked off the Criterion Collection of laserdiscs 
with a special edition of Citizen Kane. "Just being 
able to use the still·frame capacity of a laserdisc 
to reproduce budgets and scripts and pho­
tographs was pretty mind·blowing," points out 
Peter Becker, the exec· 
utive producer of Crite­
rion. Kane was fol· 
lowed by an inspired 
reconstruction of The 
Magnificent Amber· 
sons and other works 
by Welles, and another title-the rarely seen 
1973 mock documentary F for Fake-is due out 
at the end of July. Welles is the subject of a ret· 
rospective at the American Museum of the Moving Image July 8-July 30 (see "Museums, Societies, Etc."), 
where the company will premiere Theater of the Imagination, a $29.95 CD-ROM sho~casing his radio work 
along with a wealth of archival material. MICHAa GILTZ</p>
