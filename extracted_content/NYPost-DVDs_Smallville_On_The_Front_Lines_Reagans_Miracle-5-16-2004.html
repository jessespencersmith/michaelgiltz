~ Smallville: Complete Second Season *** 
Warner Bros., $59.98 
"Smallville" overcame its "creature (I)[ the week" habit from the 
first season and blossomed into an entertaining soap opera with 
superhero overtones. Unfortunately, it dropped the ball just as 
quickly, so this is the peak of the series. Extras include 
:':;commentary, deleted scenes and featurettes on Christopher 
Reeve, who's made guest appearances, and the special effects. 
walt Disney Treasures: 
On the Front Lines ***1/2 
Walt Disney, $32.99 each 
-. Disney's "Treasures" are truly 
collectables, and the latest 
batch oftitles is no exception. 
The best this week is "On the 
Front Lines," which boasts rare 
wartime footage meant to 
llJoost morale, train soldiers 
and get up the fighting spirit. 
From the feature length 
"Victory Through Air Power" 
to laughers like "Donald Gets 
Drafted," this is great, long 
forgotten art. It includes 32 
shorts in all, along with 
interviews of Roy Disney, 
inttos by Leonard Maltin and 
more. 
The Reagans 
** Lions Gate, $19.98 
James Brolin may have found 
the role of a lifetime in Ronald 
Reagan. This TV movie is 
actually watchable, thanks to 
Brolin and Judy Davis as a 
brittle Nancy Reagan who 
melts only for her man. 
Politically controversial 
deleted scenes are among the 
extras. 
Speed Racer: Volume 2 
*** Lions Gate, $22.98 born to tackle? (Instead we got 
"Days of Thunder.") Fans can 
take comfort with this 
collection of episodes 12-23 
ttom the 1967 first season of the 
animation classic. Modest 
extras and their refusal to offer 
the entire season in one set 
keep this from a higher rating. 
Miracle **1/2 
Buena Vista, $29.99 
Nothing makes grown men 
weep like a sports movie. 
"Miracle" continues the 
tradition with Kurt Russell in 
this box office hit about the u.s. hockey team that 
triumphed over the Commies 
at the 1980 Olympics. And what 
synergy! The extras for this 
film, which was in theaters in 
February, include ESPN's 
roundtable with the original 
athletes and Russell shooting 
tpe breeze. 
Casey Kasem's Rock 
'n' Roll Goldmine 
NO stars 
Kultur, $59.95 
Here's a very shabby boxed set. 
Less than five hours of rock 'n' 
roll footage stretched out over 
five discs, none of them much 
longer than 50 minutes. Even at 
half the price, this motley 
collection of archival 
performances (Jimi Hendrix, '''''1" 1\A'n1'"Y';~rt.n ~1'IT;~ t:)+ '!o1 ,</p>
