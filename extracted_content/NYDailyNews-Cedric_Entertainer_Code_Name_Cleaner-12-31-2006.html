            <p>~ COVER STORY 
Cedric the Entertainer rings in the 
new year with a new job in 'Code 
Name: The Cleaner' BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
on't look for Cedric the Entertainer to 
be working a room this New Year's Eve. 
"I stopped working on New Year's Eve 
about three years ago," says the man 
born Cedric Kyles but known to all as 
Cedric the Entertainer. 
One of the original Kings of Comedy, 
Cedric performed in Reno last night, then 
headed back home to Los Angeles to ring 
in 2007 "Vith family and friends, That's a 
lot more fun than working a crowd desper­
ate for a great time, he says. 
"My toughest New Year's Eve gig was 
probably in Oakland ," says the 42-year·old 
comedian and actor, currently heard in the 
family film "Charlotte's Web" as the voice 
of Golly the Gander, husband of Gussy the 
Goose (voiced by Oprah Wtnfrey) . 
"Oakland can be a tough crowd any­
way. But the show never really got off the 
ground and the crowd really got upset. 
By the time I hit the stage, I probably did 
about 15 or 20 minutes when they had to 
do the countdown . And they were rowdy 
and drinking. The promoters were arguing 
with the fans, and people were trying to 
get paid. It was a bad scene' 
"The promoters always have these gran­
diose ideas. Then they run out of Cristal 
early on after charging people $1,000." So, working New Year's Eve as a comic 
can be lough, though not as tough as being 
a janitor. That's the job Cedric's charac· 
ter has in the action-comedy "Code Name: 
The Cleaner," opening Friday. In it, Ced­
ric's arrtnesiac Jake wakes up in a hotel 
room next to a dead body and tries to fig­
ure out whether he's a custodian or a spy 
(while avoiding getting killed). Lucy Uu 
is along for the ride as a federal agent he 
wouldn't mind uncoveJing for clues 
"At least when you're a janitor you're 
on your own late at night and you can 
whistle at your work," says Cedlic, whose 
cool delivery and big presence stole the 
show in Spike Lee's "The Original Kings 
of Comedy," "Barbershop" and "Barber­
shop 2: Back in Business," and helped 
make "Intolerable Cruelty" and "Johnson 
Family Vacation" more fun, 
Before "Charlotte's Web," 
he also lent his deep 
tones to "Dr. Dolit-
tle 2," "Ice Age" and "Madaga scar" (a sequel to 
the latter is in the works) 
His own worst job? Well, 
though he also once had a 
gig in insurance , that hon­
or would be working at a 
factory where he had to put 
the glue on Pampers dia-
pers. Cedric worked at night 
and had to make sure one machine was 
always filled with glue; if it ran out, the 
whole system ground to a halt. 
"It was a graveyard shift," he re­
members . "I was young And they had 
these huge boxes the glue came in and 1 
climbed into one of the boxes and went 
to sleep, The supervisor woke me up 
and the red light was on and the 
machine was stopped. Dude 
looked at me; he didn't even 
have to say nothing 'Do I get 
a check? Do I gel paid for 
the day? I know I'm fired:" Now it's Cedric who is turning down 
work -especially on New Year's Eve. 
And why nor> He has already had the 
best experience he could ever have 
working thai night. 
"Oh man,l was 15 or 16 years old," he 
recalls. "1 used to have a friend who was a 
deejay, and he would deejay for these J ich 
girls. I would go with him. I didn't 
deejay, but I would carry the crates 
and hold the cords so 1 could 
hang out and just be a part of 
the party. IEveryone] would 
drink, and this girl I was infat­
uated with kissed me. 1 was 
totally out of my class! It was 
strictly a New Year's Eve kiss 
-no tongue, nothing like that. 
"But the way I was able to ma­
nipulate that with my boys for the 
next eight years? I put a little extra on 
it: 'You know I kissed her! We was tongu­
ing for a looong time, like three minutes: 
Yeah, buddy'" •</p>
