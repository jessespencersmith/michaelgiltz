'DeGrassi'de 
bomb with 
a newgen 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
WHEN the stars of the 
hit high school drama 
"DeGrassi: The Next 
Generation" came to the u.s. for a nine-city tour, 
they ~ 1iuddenly realized 
how much the Canadian 
show has caught on with 
kids. 
"They were treated like 
rock stars -all these 
screaming fans," laughs 
co-creator Linda Schuyler, 
whose show airs on cable 
channel The N Fridays at 
Sp.m. 
For anyone wondering 
what the fuss is about, to­
night's show is a perfect 
introduction since it's an 
homage to the teen classic 
"The Breakfast Club" and 
an introduction to the 
characters. 
"DeGrassi" is a Canadian 
institution that's been 
around in one form or an­
other for 25 years. In Can­
ada, it is CTV's highest­
rated Canadian show. 
It reportedly inspired 
Aaron Spelling to launch 
"Beverly Hills, 90210," 
but much of the noise re­
cently came from its hot­
button issues. 
One recent episode on 
cutting -self-mutilation, often by girls -made 
headlines when some 
teachers argued students 
copied the show. 
Another, on abortion, 
has yet to air in the U.S. as 
The N, geared toward 
teens, figures out if and 
how to present it. ' 
A third episode, on "a 
main character coming 
out, prompted an outpour­
ing of letters and critical 
praise. 
"My whole attitude' to­
ward producing the show 
is that if kids are talking 
about it in the schoolyarq, 
we can talk about it on the 
show," says Schuyler, il 
former eighth-grncfu 
teacher who decided to 
make a short film abOl-lt 
teens in 1979 that l~d t~ 
"De Grassi." ; 
"I would much raili~r 
have them talk about some 
of these issues basedotl 
what they've seen on~P1-
Grassi' rather than basep 
on the misinformation 
they've picked up on the 
schoolyard, the movies 
and the Internet." 
It is the second of eight 
new summer episodes, 
with another 22 shows hit­
ting The N starting in Oc­
tober.</p>
