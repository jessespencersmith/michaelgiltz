7/05/2005 01:49:00 AMThe United Church of Christ chose Independence Day to haveits general synod vote and affirm the Church's support for"equal marriage rights for couples, regardless of gender."It's the first mainline Christian denomination to supportsame-sex marriage. The vote was overwhelming and likelywon't lead to the schisms that have rocked the EpiscopalChurch worldwide for its more ginger steps.It's just the latest vanguard movement by UCC, which wasamong the first churches in America to condemn slavery (in1700) and the first to ordain a woman in 1853.And yes, the people who oppose equal rights for gays are thesame people who opposed equal rights for women and equalrights for blacks. And they will be proven just as wrong andfifty years from now their opposition will seem a dim, sillymemory.
