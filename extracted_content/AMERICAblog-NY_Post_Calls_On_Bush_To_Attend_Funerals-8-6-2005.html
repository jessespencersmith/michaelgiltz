8/06/2005 02:11:00 PM"Go To Ohio, Mr. President." Polite, earnest editorial.Show some leadership — starting with a visit to Brook Park,Ohio.That's the hometown of the 3rd Battalion, 25th MarineRegiment, which lost 20 Marines this week in separateincidents near the Syrian border.The town needs to see and hear the president there. Asdoes the nation.So even diehard supporters like the New York Post think enough isenough: Bush needs to acknowledge the fallen. Will he?
