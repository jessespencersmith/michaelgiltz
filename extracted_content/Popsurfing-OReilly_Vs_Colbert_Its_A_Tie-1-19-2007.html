            <p>F R I D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 9 ,  2 0 0 7O'Reilly Vs. Colbert: It's A TieBill O'Reilly and Stephen Colbert guested on each other's shows lastnight and it was a friendly, amusing affair. Both treated the situationwith the right amount of mock seriousness, with Colbert never blinkingin his love and admiration for Papa Bear O'Reilly. (Anything else wouldhave been grossly out of character.) O'Reilly MIGHT have grilledColbert on his routine in front of Bush at that annual reporter's eventand he could have done it in a way that wasn't off-putting. But hedidn't. On Colbert's show, O'Reilly continued in a good humor asColbert showed a picture of O'Reilly's face photoshopped onto a muscleguy in tight shorts, showed off an O'Reilly painting and teased moresince he was on home turf. No word on the ratings yet.If you watched all of O'Reilly, two things struck me. One, the idiotsO'Reilly had on to discuss the popularity of Jon Stewart and StephenColbert. Two, the hot water O'Reilly was in for discussing the poor kidin the kidnapping case and wondering aloud "based on the facts" asO'Reilly repeatedly said, as to why he didn't run away and whether heenjoyed not going to school and playing video games all day. O'Reillyisn't alone in this: the front page of USA Today asked the samequestion (which left me aghast) and countless reports raised the samequestion. The fact that the answers as to why are myriad, obvious andspeculative don't seem to bother anyone. Obviously, if the kid wasmolested he might have felt ashamed to come home. He might alsohave felt ashamed for getting kidnapped and every day he DIDN'T getaway increased that shame and feeling he should never have let ithappen and should have run away before, making it HARDER to do sonow. There's a third kid that vile man might have kidnapped and for allwe know this kid watched that other kid be molested and killed. Gee,think that might upset and frighten him? However this kid coped byshutting down in a nightmarish situation, God bless him. The reasonswhy he felt incapable of running away are something for him and hispsychiatrist and family to deal with privately, though it will all comeout in court I'm sure. O'Reilly was on better grounds saying he neverwould have brought his kid on Oprah, but in the same breath saying ifhe had been offered the interview he would have taken it as well.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 12:38 PM
