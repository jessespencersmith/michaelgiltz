DVDs: Last Minute Boxed Sets and Gift Guide

Don't panic. You still have time to get some great gifts. Sure it seems like
streaming video means every movie and TV show ever made is available
on demand. But it's not true (yet). And figuring out where and when some
beloved favorite is actually available and forking over the monthly fee soyou can access it is becoming as expensive as that cable package.Besides, people love celebrating the entertainment they really love and
nothing says "I'm a fan!" like a physical copy on your media shelf or an
elaborate boxed set. Many big box stores have those very boxed setspiled up on display (or you can still overnight a copy if you're reallydesperate). So here are some of the best boxed sets and recent titles you
can grab for that "one final gift" idea or stocking stuffer. Of course, you'll
need some room on that credit card you've been using nonstop since
Thanksgiving. Now you can panic!DVDs: Last Minute Boxed Sets and Gift Guide</p>
<p>DOCTOR WHO CHRISTMAS SPECIALS GIFTSET  ($57.98 BluRay; BBC
Home Entertainment)
Every Doctor Who fan knows about the Christmas specials -- the annual
TV event where the good Doctor takes part in a holiday-themedadventure. Traditionally, it aired in the UK and only popped up in the US
much later. Then it started airing on TV in the weeks after Christmas. This
year, fans can go to the movies on December 28 or 29th and watch thelatest TV special with bonus features in a one-off (or is that two-off?)event including some bonus material. But dear God, putting a movie
ticket under the tree just isn't as fun as spending the holiday itself with the
Doctor. Why not take the sting out of that delay by including the ticketinside a package with this boxed set? You get eleven Christmas specials,
a bonus feature about the tradition of a Who-vian Christmas and a 12th
Dcotor Sonic Screwdriver! Ok, a replica of the 12th Doctor's SonicScrewdriver.</p>
<p>HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2  ($38.99 BluRay combo; Sony)
Someone forgot to tell actor Adam Sandler his career was over. People
have been bad-mouthing the amiable actor for a few years. Why?Probably because he'd turned into a solid actor with some excellent filmsto his credit. A one-note performer got some props from critics...and then
continued to deliver the silly, lowbrow comedies his fans love. In the last
decade, he's become an even bigger worldwide star than ever (a rare featfor a comedy star), while the press makes it sound like he's been in
nothing but flops. And now he's enjoying the biggest hit of his career with
this silly, family friendly animated movie that Sandler co-wrote, co-executive produced and stars in. And guess what? It improved on theoriginal even with those cranky critics.
THE X-FILES COMPLETE SERIES COLLECTOR'S SET  ($299.99
BluRay; Fox)
The X-Files  is back. A six episode miniseries debuts on January 26, 2016
on FOX. What better way to prepare than to dive into all 202 episodes of</p>
<p>its nine season run? The show was groundbreaking in its ambition and
sometimes spotty in its delivery. (I'm the sort who preferred the stand-
alone episodes to the increasingly elaborate mythology episodes thatdeepened the paranoid over-arching storyline of the series.) But any short
list of great sci-fi shows begins with The Twilight Zone,  ends with
Battlestar Galactica  (the best of all time, I'd say) and includes The X-Files.
Two key reasons? The two leads and their excellent chemistry. But
beyond the good-looking David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (perhaps
the best actors to ever grace a sci-fi show), the series itself was awfully
good-looking too. It had cinematic level production values and was shotin widescreen even before widescreen was common. This BluRay boxedset looks sensational, from the visuals to the sound. It's rather pricey
given the show went off the air more than a decade ago. But it certainly
offers excellent quality as far as the presentation itself. The boxed set israther modest too, with a slot for the upcoming miniseries already in
place. But the two feature films are not included or even given a little slot
of their own. Were the movies a feint, meant to distract us from the realstoryline of the show? Will the miniseries reveal them to be part of anelaborate plot to confound us with (too much) plot? The truth is out there.
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: ROGUE NATION  ($39.99 BluRay combo;
Paramount)
Adam Sandler isn't the only movie star laughing all the way to the back.
Tom Cruise has just delivered his biggest franchise hit to date with thefourth Mission Impossible flick. It's not as good as the fourth film in the
series because Ghost Protocol marked the live action directorial debut of
Pixar's Brad Bird. But it's silly fun with some notable stunts and Cruise</p>
<p>holding it all together. BluRay and a good home theater system let movies
like this deliver in your family room almost as well as they do in the
cinemas. Yes, of course there will be a sixth impossible mission. Still, I'llprobably stick with business class when it comes to flying; I don't thinkCruise's option is a wise move, long term.
THE APU TRILOGY  ($99.95 BluRay; Criterion)
If you want to know what BluRay and DVD releases surprised and
delighted and entertained me throughout 2015, you can always start with
any list of movies put out by Criterion. But nothing could top myanticipation and delight in the release of the Apu Trilogy. This
masterpiece by Indian director Satyajit Ray is a landmark in cinema, but
"landmark" makes it sound imposing and rather severe. But few moviesare as delightful and universal as Pather Panchali , which brings alive the
life of a small boy in a village in India. The trilogy as a whole is essentially
one long movie. But you can watch each individually and with pleasure.
Despite Ray's revered status, his films had fallen into disrepair. But in thelast few years the essential work of restoring them has been tackled anda steady stream of releases of other works have done much to show how
Ray's body of work is truly impressive in its scope and range. Then along
comes the trilogy we all know him for just to remind us how great it is.The Apu Trilogy  alone would keep his name alive forever. Any true film
lover must watch these movies. The set is absolutely gorgeous (I've neverseen these movies in remotely as good condition) and filled with thevaried and intelligent extras one expects from Criterion. If you have a
movie buff on your list, any 2015 release from Criterion will be a welcome
gift. But it all starts here.</p>
<p>WOLF TOTEM  ($34.99 BluRay 3-D; Sony)
While Wolf Totem  is no Never Cry Wolf  as a movie, it is an often gorgeous-
looking movie and a fascinating glimpse into China. French director Jean-
Jacques Annaud helms this period drama about the Cultural Revolutionand a young teacher sent among Mongolian herders who adopts a pet
wolf. A famed (and presumably resonant) story to the Chinese, it's mostly
just a feast for nature lovers in the rest of the world. Annaud's movies areoften problematic but they're always interesting and admirably offbeat,
from The Bear  to Quest For Fire  to Seven Years In Tibet  and now this. The
extras make clear the elaborate, almost unprecedented lengths they went
to film the wolves safely.
THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW LOST EPISODES ULTIMATE</p>
<p>COLLECTION  ($206.95 DVD; Time Life)
If you've got a fan of Carol Burnett on your list, you can wow them with a
collection of "lost" episodes from her iconic variety series. True, most
fans think they know all of her shows by heart, along with belovedsketches like "Went With The Wind." But for various copyright reasons,shows from the first five years haven't been seen since they originally
aired from 1967-1972. You literally watch the show come to life, find its
footing and launch the first of classic, long-running bits. If you're a fan,it's a treat, a way to see "new" episodes for the first time in decades. Ifyou're not a fan, you'll become one. The set is presented with care by
Time-Life, which has made a name for itself with quality, elaborate (and
expensive) boxed sets of classic TV. However, multiple versions of thisset are for sale, including less complete but still very fun (and much more
affordable) versions than the one shown here.
ANT-MAN  ($32.99 BluRay combo; Walt Disney Studios)
Did this movie sort of slip by you? I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd because,
well, I have taste. So I didn't miss it and knew early on this was a winner,a loopy, goofy flick that captured the loosey-goosey, jokey nature ofMarvel comics better than almost any other entry except the first
Avengers movie. And guess what? Other than Iron Man, this is the most
successful launch for a solo hero yet. Ant-Man made more moneyworldwide than Captain America and Thor and of course The Incredible
Hulk. (Guardians of the Galaxy is more of a team effort, I'd say, and it
beats even the original Iron Man.) I credit Rudd's self-effacing butcharming vibe, a strong supporting cast and a fun score that gives themovie a unique character all its own. Can't wait to see how Rudd</p>
<p>interacts with the other Avengers, but I'm predicting a wise-ass
demeanor that makes Deadpool seem polite in comparison, and a lot
more amusing. So if you've got Marvel fans who let this movie come andgo before checking it out, give 'em a treat.
DUCK DYNASTY SEASONS 1-8  ($119.98 DVD; A&E)
So what do you get the Trump supporter in the family that you dreadtalking to on Christmas Day? How about the first eight seasons of DuckDynasty? You get 89 episodes and even some extras, so that should giveeveryone plenty of TV to watch and giggle at without actually discussing
politics! Just don't take the bait when they say, "You know, Phil
Robertson makes a lot of sense!"</p>
<p>BACK TO THE FUTURE 30TH ANNIVERSARY  ($49.98 BluRay;
Universal)
MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL 40TH ANNIVERSARY
($19.99 BluRay; Sony)
If any of the kids on your list are getting a hoverboard, for the love of Pete
get them Back To The Future  as well! Surely they should know the origin
story of where hoverboards began (sort of), not to mention one of the
wittiest and clever summer blockbusters in Hollywood history. Yes,popcorn movies used to actually be good, kids!
If you've got a Monty Python fan, you can pair up a can of Spam and the
40th anniversary edition of their greatest movie, The Holy Grail.  If they</p>
<p>immediately point out that Spam does not actually FIGURE in the movie
Monty Python and the Holy Grail,  but only on the TV series Monty Python
and the Flying Circus  and then they proceed to name every sketch
included in their first film, well then you KNOW you bought them the right
movie.
DOC MARTIN SEASON 7  ($39.99 DVD; Acorn Media)
SHAMELESS SEASON 5  ($44.96 BluRay; Warner Home Video)</p>
<p>I find it impossible to resist the TV series Doc Martin.  It's a frustrating
show, one of those romances where you wait forever for the two leads to
get together and even when they do all sort of artificial roadblocks keepthem from happiness. (Think Sam and Diane from Cheers .) Here it's the
prickly doctor (Martin Clunes) and the adorable schoolteacher Louisa
Glasson (Caroline Catz). They're finally and forever together, but each
season they seem to get drawn apart in some way before ending up rightback where they started at the end. But the two have marvelous
chemistry and the supporting cast is often excellent, though Eileen Atkins
has been almost criminally wasted and Sigourney Weaver was in just ablink at you miss it storyline as a tourist). And still, the town (the onlysunny seaside resort in England), the people, the ambiance and the two
leads keep me returning.
Certainly Shameless  on Showtime deserves more love. The original UK
series enjoyed great acclaim but this US version has flown mostly under
the radar despite starring the dependable William H Macy in the comedic
role of his career. I dove back in because Cameron Monaghan was soelectric as the progenitor of the Joker on Gotham . Here he plays the gay
teenage son Ian and is just one of a very strong cast in this over-the-topcomedic drama. Season six starts on January 10 so start bingeing now.</p>
<p>THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER  ($34.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber)
SALAAM BOMBAY!  ($29.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber)
Got a lover of international cinema in the family? Here are two terrific
choices. The Kindergarten Teacher is an absorbing, critically acclaimed
drama about a teacher who becomes very supportive of a student with
exceptional skills and then a little too supportive and then downright
obsessive. It confirms writer-director Nadav Lapid is a genuine talent.Salaam Bombay!  did the same for director Mira Nair in this 1988 charmer
about life on the streets of Bombay for a little boy. It comes out on
BluRay for the first time and is a great reminder of how much we've lost
by not having more female directors like Nair get a shot at the bigleagues.</p>
<p>DOWNTON ABBEY LIMITED EDITION SEASONS 1-5  ($109.99 BluRay;
PBS Home Video)
FOYLE'S WAR: THE COMPLETE SAGA  ($199.99 DVD; Acorn Media)
If you're in the UK, you're about to see the final Christmas special for
Downton Abbey,  a TV movie that will wrap up the series once and for all. If
you're in the US and not being naughty (Santa won't bring you gifts if youstream overseas TV shows), then you're eagerly waiting the start of thefinal season on January 3, 2016. If you just can't wait -- or you want togive a treat to someone who loves the show -- this limited edition BluRay
set lets them binge-watch in style. You'll find the first five seasons, with
the original British cut of the episodes all looking impressive enough toplacate the Dowager Countess. Of course, I still insist that it's not a patchon the original Upstairs, Downstairs but if you want the holidays to be
happy, I've learned it's best sometimes to keep your superior TV insights
to yourself. Also, this set will be superseded by a boxed set that presentsthe entire series, but you knew that already, didn't you?
Well, fans of British mysteries won't have to suffer from feelings of
incompleteness-boxed set-itis when it comes to Foyle's War.  The show is
absolutely, honest to goodness done after having one series finale and
then coming back for another few specials/seasons. Here you've got the
entire saga, as the boxed set proclaims, though "saga" sounds too bigand sprawling for a series that delighted in the low-key, magnetic
performance of Michael Kitchen as Foyle. Initially set during WW II, Foyle
is forced to remain at home keeping crime in check when he'd rather beoff fighting the Nazis. Typically, each episode would use a crime as an</p>
<p>excuse to explore some facet of the war, such as the black market for
food and fuel, Nazi sympathizers, the tension between Allied soldiers and
locals and more. But it shone thanks to an excellent cast that alsoincluded the beautifully named actress Honeysuckle Weeks. In retrospect,
the series began at its peak, maintained excellent quality for a few years
then slowly declined. But even the post-war episodes with Foyle enteringspy territory had its moments and Kitchen never faltered in a performancethat is one of the greats in TV history. He did more with a raised eyebrow
and a simple "Really?" than Columbo could do with a half hour of
rambling questions or Holmes with a full array of evidence from tobaccoto muddy boots.</p>
<p>SINATRA: ALL OR NOTHING AT ALL  ($29.98 BluRay; Eagle Rock)
FRANK SINATRA COLLECTION  ($69.96 BluRay; Warner Home Video)
SINATRA: THE CHAIRMAN  By James Kaplan ($35; Doubleday)
SINATRA: A VOICE ON AIR 1935-1955  ($69.99 CD; Sony Legacy)
Since it's the 100th anniversary of the birth of Frank Sinatra, surely
there's some swinger in the family who wants to remember Sinatra. You
can start with the documentary All Or Nothing At All.  It cleverly uses the
first "retirement" concert of Sinatra as a backbone, using the set-list totell the story of Sinatra's remarkable career. As a buff, I can't get enough
of archival footage and hearing this story again and again, though only</p>
<p>newer fans will hear a lot of new stories or gain new insight. Still, it's a
thoughtful, family-approved work. You get the substantial film on two
discs, plus the entire 1971 concert in full on a third and a Walter Cronkite
interview of Sinatra on the fourth disc.
First and forever, Sinatra is a singer. Nonetheless, he had a formidable
movie career and this fiv film set is definitely totemic. It doesn't contain
his five best films but it certainly contains five films that capture Sinatra at
his movie star peak and his ring-a-ding-dingiest. Anchors Aweigh  and the
landmark On The Town  are two delightful musicals with Sinatra in top
form. Guys And Dolls  is one of the tragic misfires in movie history, with
Marlon Brando absurdly tackling a musical comedy role that is legendaryand one that fit Sinatra to a t. Meanwhile, Sinatra has a lesser, secondarypart. Ocean's 11  is essential for understanding the Rat Pack appeal of
Sinatra and his pals, an almost puzzling phenomenon now given how lazyand unredeeming their movies proved. Case in point: Robin and the SevenHoods,  a flick where the lunatics are clearly in charge of the asylum, the
director was lucky if they showed up to deliver even one take and thematerial at hand wasn't worth much more than that anyway. And STILLit's sort of watchable, with Bing Crosby making the most of the movie's
one good new song, "Mr. Booze." Someone is trying to turn this into a
Broadway musical. Let's hope they're writing a bunch of new songs anda whole new book.
James Kaplan just delivered the second of his two-volume work about
Sinatra. I slightly preferred Frank: The Voice,  just because it dealt with his
rise to fame. A young, struggling Sinatra is a lot more appealing than
Sinatra in his prime. This volume covers the glory days of the Capitol
years, the Reprise years and all those movies and radio and TV specials.Sinatra is the king of the world and Kaplan's book is too obsessed withgossip and whether or not Sinatra slept with this gal or that gal and
whether JFK did too. For me, the roughly 100 pages from both books that
actually focus on the recording of his music are what matters. ThereKaplan delivers some marvelous context, the viewpoints of others likemusicians and his peerless arrangers (led by the great Nelson Riddle of
course). Any insight into his classic work is precious and when it comes
to music, Kaplan's attention to detail is appreciated. If you want the good,the bad, the ugly and the tawdry, well this is the book for you. As much
as Kaplan takes his subject seriously, it's a tabloid life at heart.
But it's the music that matters, the music that endures. If you've got a
serious Sinatra buff on your list you will delight them with the new four
CD set Sinatra: A Voice On Air 1935-1955.  It's almost inconceivable that
there's new Sinatra material to be unearthed, but indeed there is. This set
covers Sinatra's radio career, from his tentative early appearances to the</p>
<p>string of shows he starred on. Radio was the TV of its day and that's
where Sinatra honed his craft and created a bond with his audience that
would last for decades. He is one of the great recording artists of all time
and his appearances on radio mean a wealth of songs Sinatra neverofficially recorded, songs performed with new arrangements, duets, andmore. In some ways, this set has it all. You get 106 tracks, ranging from
theme songs to commercial breaks to medleys to comedy routines,
introductions and (mostly) full blown performances of great songs. Asignificant portion are first-timers, tunes we haven't had on disc yet by
Sinatra, but everything is of interest to a fan. It's a pleasure to dive into,
from the creamy sound of young Frankie to the sharp, insightful powerfulsnap of the mid-1950s Sinatra on the brink of recording the greatestmusic of his career after the greatest comeback in music history. Give it
to a genuine fan who already owns a bunch of Sinatra and they'll be
delighted.
Who could ask for anything more? Well, I could. First, there's a FIFTH
disc of music from this era. It's only available from 
Smithsonian directly.
It's called Frank Sinatra: Lost And Found -- The Radio Years. Why oh why
would you make buffs wait decades for a proper boxed set of his radio
performances than relegate a fifth CD of worthwhile material to another
label? It makes no sense. In a further slight to collectors, the set lazilydoesn't include chapter breaks at the beginning of songs whenever
possible. Many tunes include radio introductions or a show theme song
opener before a song begins. Sometimes, it's not possible to create asmooth break. But many, many times it is and simply including a chapterbreak would have allowed people who had listened to the set to pull out
and make a playlist of -- for example -- the "new" songs Sinatra never
recorded or their favorites from this collection and so on. It's sheerindifference to the listener not to do so. Finally, the set halfheartedly
makes a stab at creating the experience of listening to a radio broadcast,
thanks to the welcome inclusion of all those show intros and some funcommercial breaks. However, the commercial breaks are often tacked onat the end of a CD. For a more pleasurable listening experience when
hearing the boxed set as a whole, those breaks should be sprinkled
naturally throughout.
So putting all those caveats aside, what do you get? A good boxed set
that will be catnip to Sinatra fans but is definitely not the place to start for
newbies. I found it fascinating on two levels: the personal and the artistic.On the personal level, we see Sinatra grow by leaps and bounds. In his
first appearance, he's so tongue-tied that Sinatra can barely mumble out
one-word responses to softball questions. For quite a while, he remains,the unctuous student of his betters, fawningly (but genuinely) payinghomage to the songwriting greats and other artists of the day. Every once</p>
<p>in a while, an audience is present and his singing is interrupted by the
seismic screaming of teenage girls over Sinatra's every utterance. You're
reminded of how Beatlemania came in the wake of the Sinatra swooners,those frenzied bobby soxers who loved The Voice. Then things change.Sinatra moves from the butt of jokes to the maker of jokes. As he grows in
commercial clout and confidence, suddenly it's the guests who pay
homage to him. Sinatra never could tell a joke (or play the straight man) tosave his life. But by god he's gonna make the jokes and the hangers-on
laugh more and more. The second level is the artistic. Everyone knows
Sinatra progressed from a hearts and flowers crooner, The Voice, into asinger of extraordinary talent. You can hear that happen on these discs.He's always good. But the Sinatra of 1935 couldn't hold a candle to the
Sinatra of 1955, who is suddenly snapping off lines, giving weight to the
lyrics and doing much than making a pretty sound. It's thrilling to know hewas on top of the world commercially for almost two decades and yet still
getting better and better as a singer. You can hear it happen right before
your ears.
And that's the final caveat. With Sinatra, more is always better. We've
had the complete Columbia, the complete Capital and the complete
Reprise boxed sets. After all this time, we deserved the complete Radioset. It couldn't be actually complete, naturally. But this set is discerningand smart and is of remarkable sound quality given the years that have
passed. Yet it stops right when Sinatra is becoming greater than ever.
Why? They should have made one big set, Sinatra: On The Air 1935-whenever his final radio appearance occurred . The second half would kick
the ass of the first half, so at least we can look forward to an even betterset covering 1956 and beyond. And no final disc of material handed off tothird parties! When it comes to Sinatra, you want it all.
