            <p>T H U R S D AY,  A U G U S T  2 4 ,  2 0 0 6Corinne Bailey Rae At Webster Hall ****Never been to Webster Hall somehow; it's a bit larger than BoweryBallroom (where Rae performed a few months ago) and the walls arecovered in a mish-mash of exotic designs: some Indian, some Chineseor Asian and then the odd seashell just to keep you guessing. I'm in the"VIP" area upstairs, which is lucky since the main floor is jammed veryearly on. I walked in ten minutes before her Bowery Ballroom set andgot right near the stage. Tonight I arrived an hour early and I wouldhave been way in the back if not for my access to the balcony. Luckily,two women (presumably the mom and sister or friend of the openingact) vacate their seats right at the balcony edge before Rae comes onand we have excellent sight-lines from stage right.Rae was wonderful the first time I saw her, but perhaps herhand-motions and other bits of business were somewhat studied.Tonight she is in full control, her voice sounds glorious and she playsevery song on the album plus that ferocious Led Zeppelin cover. A fewpeople toss her flowers and one fellow also hands up a tiny BarneysNew York bag, because of course she's wealthier than ever so naturallyshe needs some free jewelry or whatever.I love the way Rae still seems sweetly overwhelmed by the applauseand the fact that people are embracing her music. She scrunches up herface and offers a "Thank you" time and time again. The finale "SeasonsChange" (a Stevie Wonder wig-out) is sensational. Rae says she isalready a bit weary of being a star and all the attendant attention. (FleetStreet people have camped out on her family's doorstep.) Well, it's justgetting started I'm afraid. She is the real deal.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
