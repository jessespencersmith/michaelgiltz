The Big Red One: The 
Reconstrudion **'/2 Warner Bros., $26.99 
DIRECTOR Sam Fuller is the 
king of movies that were 
butchered by film studios and 
this World War II drama is 
example No.1. Forty minutes of 
new scenes show how well he 
captured the downtime and . 
vicissitudes of war. Extras 
include a look at Fuller's career 
and the real exploits of the unit 
portrayed. National 
'D'easure **'/2 Disney, $29.99 
AN enjoyable bit of 
malarkey about 
Freemasons, the 
Knights Templar, buried 
treasure in downtown 
Manhattan and a secret 
map on the back of tl1e 
Declaration of 
Independence. We can 
be relieved that this

DIRECTOR Joel Schumacher 
has made a very faithful 
adaptation of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's mega-musical, so of 
course this is a stiff, dreadful 
bore. "Evita" made a better 
movie and the much-maligned 
"Cats" had better lyrics. But at 
least Webber now can boast of 
the most expensive keepsake in 
Broadway history. j
