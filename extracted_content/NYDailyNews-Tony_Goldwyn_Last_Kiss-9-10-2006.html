" (f) Zach Braff's new film helped 
director Tony Goldwyn grow up 
BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
A ctorTonyGoldwyn 
has only directed 
three movies, buht 
has happened every 
time: He catches 
the star on the rise. 
In his 1999 gem 
"A Walk on the Moon," Goldwyn 
worked with Viggo Mortensen just 
as the actor was poised for super­
stardom in "The Lord of the Rings." 
In the little-seen 2001 "Someone 
Like You," Goldwyn cast Hugh Jack­
man as a romantic leading man when 
most others still thought he was just 
an "X-Men" hero with claws 
Now, in the comedy-drama "The 
Last Kiss," Goldwyn's got Zach Braff 
of TV's "Scrubs" and the film "Gar­
den State" (which Braff also directed) 
just as he's ready for bigger things. 
"Zach's just coming into his own 
as a performer," says Goldwyn. "In 
a way, this character is a whole new 
thing for him. In 'Garden State,' good 
as he was in it, he was more reacting 
to all the people around him. 
"In this movie, Zach really drives 
the thing." 
A remake of a 2001 Italian film, 
"The Last Kiss" follows four young 
men in Madison, Wis., scared stiff 
about the onslaught of adult respon­
sibilities . Izzy (Michael Weston) 
wants to escape on a road trip after 
being dumped by a girlfriend and 
tending to his ailing dad. Kenny (Eric 
Christian Olsen) has a strict poli-
cy of no-strings sex. Chris (Casey 
Aft1eck), married with a new­
born baby, stays late at work rath, 
er than dealing with the over­
whelming needs of his young 
family. 
And at the center is Michael 
(Braff), who's got a gorgeous 
-and pregnant -girlfriend 
(J acinda Barrett) who doesn't 
mind his fear of marriage . 
And no wonder: her mother· 
(Blythe Danner) is about 
to revea I an extramarital 
affair and leave her dad 
(Tom WJ.i.kinson) . 
"There's a lot required 
of Zach as an actor -he 
has to be funny and emo­
tional and empathetic," 
says Goldwyn . "Somehow, 
he manages to maintain the 
audience's empathy through­
out the movie, even during the 
moments they hate him." 
Despite Goldwyn's knack 
for heat-seeking actors, 
directing is a midcareer switch 
for him. He worked for many 
years as an actor, playing ev­
erything from a memorably evil yuppie in "Ghost" to a closeted TV 
star on "The L Word." He was even 
the voice of the title hero in Disney's 
1999 animated film "Tarzan." And he 
has been behind-the-scenes on Tv, 
guiding episodes of "Grey's Anato­
my," the new drama "Kidnapped" and 
Showtime's "Dexter." 
And GoldW'jll of course has 
movies in his blood: His grandfa­
ther was Samuel Goldwyn -the G 
in MGM -and his father is producer 
Samuel Goldwyn Jr. 
" 'The Last Kiss' was a film 
that really interested me be­
cause it felt very reaJ." 
Goldwyn says. "When I 
read the script, I thought 
it was a chance to make 
a film that could be fun­
ny and entertaining, 
and honest about how 
hard it is to navigate 
relationships and 
commitmen t 
"And it involves the 
process of coping with 
crises, of all sorts. What 
happens when life 
doesn't go the way you 
planned it." • CLINCHING IT Director Tony 
Goldwyn (above, on set) says 
with "The Last Kiss" (below), 
actor Zach Braff "comes into 
his own," while co-star Rachel 
Bilson "is so confident, it's 
like she's been acting 
for 20 years."</p>
