            <p>T U E S D AY,  M AY  1 6 ,  2 0 0 6Cannes Day OneStephen arrives an hour early and wakes me up...at 11:10 a.m. Theregoes my plan to get up at 8 a.m. and prepare for doing that for the nexttwo weeks. I have a wound on my face right by my nose -- that musthave been a restless sleep indeed. We wander around, getting ourbadges and bags, checking out the press room, going to FNAC andgetting our mobile phone sim cards, some extra keys for the apartmentand so on. Stephen is getting married and talks about the odd feeling ofregistering for gifts -- basically you go to Bloomingdales or Tiffany's orwhatever and they give you a "zap gun." You take it and wander aroundthe store and zap the UPC code of anthing you like. Like most men,Stephen feels very odd about telling people what you want them to buy.Like most women, his fiance doesn't think twice. He also talks aboutWayne-Williams, a Manhattan store that is "super preppie" with reallyodd items that you won't find anywhere else. When they go to registerthere, there is no zap gun. Most items don't even have UPC codes. Alittle old lady follows them around, writing down the items they like inlonghand in a little book. Very preppie indeed. And as we're walkinghome, Stephen points out his favorite store at Cannes. Now it's myfavorite too. It's called:ARMURERIE COUETELLERIE CHIENYes, it's a store with weapons, cutlery and accessories for dogs. Clearlythese are the three passions of the owners. Inside you can find rowsand rows of scissors (very sharp scissors, I imagine), forks, spoons,many many knives, a wall of swords, some ancient rifles and yes, dogcollars and pet toys for your mutt. Presumaby hunting dogs are themost prized of all. Surely no other store in the world has quite thiscombination of items. Tonight: The Da Vinci Code, which is 2 and ahalf hours, or to put it another way, half an hour longer than it shouldbe. I point out to Stephen my thought of the affinity between "ABeautiful Mind" and "Da Vinci Code." Both have to illustrate abstractthought and mathematical formula and I think they'd be very wise touse the same approach of numbers and letters floating onscreen andlighting up and rearranging when the code is broken or an insight ismade.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 4:49 PM
