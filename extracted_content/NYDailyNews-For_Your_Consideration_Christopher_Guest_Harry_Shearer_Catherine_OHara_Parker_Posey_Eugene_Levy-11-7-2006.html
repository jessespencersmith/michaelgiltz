( ommunity theater, dog shows and old folkies have been 
satirized by writer-director Christopher Guest and his 
merry pranksters in "Waiting for Guffman" (1996), "Best 
in Show" (2000) and "A Mighty Wind" (2003). Now with 
"For Your Consideration," the Guest stars take aim at the world 
of Hollywood awards. Co-writer Eugene Levy plays a hapless 
agent and Harry Shearer, Parker Posey and Catherine O'Hara 
are the actors in a film called "Home [ai' Purim" who have 
dreams of gold statues -and egos of glass. The "Consider­
ation" team recently sat wiH1 the Daily News to riff away. 
So, if you're ever up for an award, everyone always teils 
you they voted for you, don't they? 
Christopher Guest: Absolutely, they do that. 
Eugene Levy: I don't run into a lot of people who get 
nominated for Oscars ... 
Harry Shearer: Well, you live at Brad Pitt's pool house. 
Levy: He's never home. 
Sfleater: Good pCJint. 
Guest: The irony is til at I actually do give medals to people 
WIIO Ilave ;vm-ked on [my films]. Hie first was for "Guffman," 
I Ilao tl,ese medals designed and it just said "For Service." 
Someone had said, "What cio you want, a medal?" And I 
tllOUgl1t, "Yeah!" It's different for every movie. 
Catherine O'Hara: I don't think I ever got one for ... 
Guest: Of course you did. 
Silearer: Uh-oh, it's a medal scandal brewing here. 
Being part of an ensemble iiI{e this is lmusual, isn't it? 
Levy: It is, and also fun. And creatively it's very liberating. 
fInd the sl100ting schedule is not long at all. 
Sl1eal'er: Not long enough. 
Gliiest: This was 27 days, whic!l IS less Ulan a conven­
tional movie by ... 90 days. 
Parl<er Posey: On other movies, you wonder, HAm I going to 
wot-k with a director who' s going to have a sense of humet? 
,(\re ti1e'! going to be cruel and unpleasant'? Or violent'," 
.o'Hara: Have you ever worked on -soDletl dr1~~ and go1.tel~ 
the sense that vou're in the vvrong harlds? 
Shearer: Yes! 
O';'1am; it's disillusioning . It's so nice to ttust everyone 
you'l-e acting with, and Chris really does take care of us. 
So, no spoofing, the director really does set the torm? 
Guest: I take this really seriously. as far as serving the tal­
ent 01 tllese actors. There's nothing more serious I can do. 
Shearer: I always dread in films that the director is going 
to say, "Ol-(ay, one more take. And bigger!" And Ilmow that's 
the one he's going to use and that's the one that's going to 
mai-<e me look stupid. 
Guest: But when I say that, you don't seem to mind ... 
SJleare,; Well, Ii-<now you don't mean it. .. 'For Your Consideration'
