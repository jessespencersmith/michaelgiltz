8/17/2004 10:10:00 AMThe Washington Post has a very good story on the tug-of-warbetween safety and civil liberties during the Republican NationalConvention in NYC. They detail a lot of planned protests and do around-up of recent events where the police went overboard andsquashed appropriate protests.But my favorite bits include descriptions of some of the clever eventsprotestors have planned:One "Paul Revere" protest will have a person riding through the citywith the warning, "The Republicans are coming! The Republicans arecoming!" (God, that's funny.)Another will feature the world's longest unemployment line.But one they missed is also sure to gain lots of attention: it's aone-day genuine vomitorium, with volunteers being served endlessamounts of food and then throwing up so they can keep eating. All inthe spirit of comparing Bush to the Roman Empire and its hubris inoverextending itself, gorging the filthy rich and so on.Hopefully, these are the sorts of events the media will focus on,rather than any hooligans, which cops describe as expected in thehundreds (as opposed to the half a million or more protestorsoverall).
