            <p>Theater: Fiona Shaw Rocks in One of theLast Shows of the Year
Five final shows to see before the holidays take over. They ranged from a marvelous
breathing-to-life of a poem more than 200 years old, a so-so take on the Scottishplay, a one-man homage to a master via August Wilson's biographical piece and twonew works from talented writers striving for greatness.

THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER  *** 1/2
BAMIn 1996, Fiona Shaw performed T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land  at a dilapidated theater
in New York; I didn't see it and have kicked myself ever since. I even fantasized about
bumping into Shaw on the street or at a party, collaring her and playfully mentioning
how I have berated myself with the inevitable fantasy ending -- Shaw impulsively
recites the entire piece right on the spot. Well, that hasn't happened yet but the next
best thing is taking place at the Brooklyn Academy Of Music. Shaw and her longtimecollaborator director Phyllida Lloyd have staged an impeccable production of SamuelTaylor Coleridge's mythic Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.
It's an enduring work but not one of my favorites, which is why this entertaining
evening is only 3 1/2 stars and not four. They simply get everything they can out ofthis haunted tale of a sailor who kills an albatross, finds his ship becalmed andultimately haunted by the souls of the many men who paid the ultimate price for hisact of hubris/cruelty/indifference to a creature that loved him and brought the shipluck. It's a simple, compelling work: the sailor stops a stranger on the street and theman listens, almost hypnotized, by this strangely compelling tale that has no meaning,no explanation but stays with him. Certain lines are iconic, but what stands out here isthe effortless theatricality on display.
One can't praise the technical elements enough, from the simple yet evocative stage
design of Chloe Obolensky (making excellent use of sailing canvas) to the tandem
work of the lighting by Jean Kalman and Mike Gunning with the composition and
sound design of Mel Mercier. I don't know if I've ever seen the audience lit in a
particular color (as opposed to the stage) but it was a striking effect and probably veryinteresting for the actors to see us bathed in red at one key point.May 16, 2014

I assumed it was a one-woman show but this is very much a duo. Shaw is joined
onstage by dancer and actor Daniel Hay-Gordon and he is an effective and affectingpartner. Shaw performs the entire piece so at times she is the Wedding Guest who iscollared by the sailor, at times the Ancient Mariner, at times the other sailors and soon. Thanks to Lloyd's flawless touch, the transitions between the two actors as theychange parts (Shaw might deliver one line as the Mariner and the next as the Guest)are effortless. A long pole, a bit of sailing canvas, a crate and the stage comes alivewith corpses stumbling on deck (Hay-Gordon in excellent form), men in row boatscoming to see the spectacle, the Mariner cursed by his fellow sailors to carry the dead
albatross around his neck and more. Hay-Gordon handles the subtle choreography by
Kim Brandstrup with ease and he matches the great Shaw every step of the way
without saying a word. He is an admirable (and admirably pliable) partner for this
dance.
But of course Shaw commands the stage, whether roaming the theater beforehand
and amusingly pulling people onstage to try on different props or suddenly bringing usto attention as the show begins with her commanding, magnetic voice. At 45 minutes,it is a full evening of theater, though I admitted to churlishly hoping for an encore of"Kubla Khan." Doing two major poems might dilute the power of either though I alsofantasized about an evening that paired Rime with The Waste Land. But Shaw isalways looking forward so here's hoping other evocative poems and narrative classicswill get her to return to this genre soon. The Canterbury Tales? Spencer's The FaerieQueen? The Odyssey? The possibilities are endless.
MACBETH  **
LINCOLN CENTER
You never want to walk away from a production of Macbeth  discussing the witches
and the set design, but those are the most notable elements of this well-intentioned
production from director Jack O'Brien that is handsomely mounted but has yet tocohere into a convincing whole. Mind you, it seems the show is strongly improvedfrom the early previews so check in at the end of this run and will likely be closer thanever to reflecting the skills of all involved.
Shakespeare's tale of greed for power is familiar. Macbeth is a faithful servant to the
king, but the mere whisper that he deserves more pushes him to terrible deeds: heslaughters the king, orders the death of those near and dear to the monarch andcauses open war to split the nation. His wife urges him along though just as quicklyguilt dogs them both and their dreams of power go horribly wrong. It's a cautionarytale: murder your guests and you'll at the very least gain a fearsome reputation andfew takers of your hospitality in the future.</p>
<p>The handsome set by Scott Pask is fluidly handled by O'Brien, who keeps things
moving briskly at least. The three witches are played by men (Byron Jennings,Malcolm Gets and especially a camp John Glover). It's not a revealing take on things,but Glover does give us some playful bursts of comedy amidst the sturm und drang ofthe Scottish play. Anne-Marie Duff makes her Broadway debut here but we'll have towait for better circumstances to see what she's capable of doing. We already knowHawke is a brilliant, committed stage actor who has triumphed in everything fromShakespeare to Stoppard. Their two characters are delivered clearly, sometimeseffectively but never fully alive. Of course Hawke is too good not to have hismoments: the scene where he's told Lady Macbeth is dead scores home simply with
Hawke onstage, not saying a word, holding us rapt with his shock and grief delivered
subtly and magnetically.
Richard Easton of course is kingly, Brian d'Arcy James a solid and stolid Banquo and
Daniel Sunjata best of all as a fiery, vengeful Macduff. The sword fighting is effectivelystylized for most of the show, though the imagination of fight director Steve Rankinand O'Brien falters at the death of Macbeth. All the tech elements are well done withthe very notable exception of a scene with the witches where Macbeth's visions arebanally depicted in full video displays that are all too literal.
Talented artists all worked hard here; sometimes, it just doesn't come together or not
soon enough as opening night looms. But the care taken extends to the effectiveopening right to the curtain calls (a particular fascination of mine for what it revealsabout the talent involved or at least the director's handling of them). Too often, ashow with a large cast exhausts an audience as it struggles to give so many people achance to bow; even a great show can run out of steam as line after line of performerstrudge to the stage, bow and then slowly make way for others. Here O'Brien haseveryone move swiftly and effectively, moving in and out castmembers with thesureness of a general so that the applause need barely pause as dozens of peopleflew up and away so that an audience could show their support for the cast. Then in a
very effective finale punctuated by the rousing music of Mark Bennett (who also did
the sound), the cast melted away and Hawke and Duff had a moment alone and then
she too whisked away. In a dramatic echo of the opener, the music thundered, the
lights dramatically narrowed to a spotlight on Hawke, he bowed his head, one moreburst of music and boom the light disappeared and he was gone. It was a welcomeburst of showmanship. If the show had been a bigger creative success, that finalflourish would have sent the audience into a frenzy. As it was, it allowed the audienceto appreciate the attention paid to every detail.
HOW I LEARNED WHAT I LEARNED  ***
SIGNATURE THEATREAugust Wilson left us too soon, though he also did so with excellent dramatic
instincts: he died just as he completed his cycle of ten plays, one for every decade ofthe 20th century. Among other works, he left this one-man autobiographical workbristling with intelligence and suffused with humor and insight on America, his own lifeand the African American experience.
Who better to bring this show back to life than Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the talented
actor, writer and director who was inspired by Wilson, rose to great heights as an
actor in those plays, pursued his own muse and is now a guiding force behind the
many productions of Wilson around the country. (Last year, the most producedplaywright in America was Shakespeare. Number two? August Wilson.)</p>
<p>This simple but effective bit of showmanship -- sort of a lecture cum memory play -- is
not a great piece of theater, like so many of Wilson's works. It's a little shapeless in itsstructure and repetitive in its message. But anyone with even a passing interest in oneof the great playwrights of the century will find much on offer, from stories of hisprickly temper to brushes with death and the people in Wilson's life who recognizedhis talent and protected and nurtured it with a fierce identity.
Santiago-Hudson holds the stage with ease -- our gain with him as a director is our
loss with him as a full-time actor. He doesn't attempt an imitation of Wilson, but hedoes embody the man. If nothing else, the listing of those ten plays at the finale isenough to bring anyone to their feet. Jitney. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. Fences. Joe
Turner's Come And Gone. The Piano Lesson. Two Trains Running. Seven Guitars.
King Hedley II. Gem Of The Ocean. Radio Golf.  We're just beginning to appreciate
what a remarkable body of work that is. And How I Learned What I Learned  is an
enjoyable step in that journey.
THE (CURIOUS CASE OF THE) WATSON INTELLIGENCE  ***
PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONThis world premiere of a new play by Madeleine George is wonderfully acted and has
moments of such greatness that you're eager to lock the playwright in a room with hermuse (or a stern dramaturg or both) and insist she not come out until she's wrestledthe masterpiece that is bursting to come out of this too-long but thoroughly intriguingand inventive work.
The conceit is to track great Watsons throughout history. Watson, we come to realize,
is the perfect sidekick, the ideal companion. There's the Dr. Watson who providedsteadfast support to the great detective Sherlock Holmes. Don't forget Thomas
Watson, the industrious associate of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the
telephone and the man who uttered that fateful phrase, "Watson, come here! I want to
see you!" And everyone remembers Watson, the IBM computer that triumphed on
Jeopardy. Add to that list Watson, a dweeb who provides tech support for people with
computers and like so many other Watsons proves the ideal companion.
This Watson is hired by a would-be politician who wants him to spy on the politician's
ex-wife. Watson does -- albeit awkwardly (Watsons are too decent and nice to begood at subterfuge) -- and he and the ex-wife (a scientist working on her ownWatson-like software program) soon fall deliriously in love.</p>
<p>George's play jumps back and forth in time, with the Watson of detective fame taking
on the case of a woman who is suspicious of her husband to the telephone Watsonbeing interviewed on the radio about the invention of the telephone to present-dayWatson faithfully waiting for this beautiful, intelligent woman to simply accept the factthat she and this nerd are truly in love and that's okay.
Leigh Silverman directs superbly and the three actors are in excellent sync. David
Costabile has the least interesting part as the suspicious politician, a maniacalVictorian inventor and so-on. But Amanda Quaid is very good as the women in theshow and has great chemistry with John Ellison Conlee as all the Watsons. They'reably aided by a simple but effective set design by Louisa Thompson that uses
curtains to quickly change the setting from era to era, working hand in hand with
strong costumes by Anita Yavich, good lighting by Mark Burton and great sound
design by Matt Tierney that quickly and effectively lets us know where and when weare.
The play is substantially longer than it should be. (You always know more work needs
to be done when the audience is unsure the play is over.) But there's great material
here that can and must be shaped into a great play. For starters, the Watson conceit
has run away with the show. One of the highlights is the interview scene between theSherlock Holmes era Dr. Watson and the woman in distress. The scene crackles withhumor, intimacy and charm. But it tells us everything we need to know about thatWatson. The scenes where he tries to solve the case and confronts a madman who isbuilding his own perfect mechanical companion are simply uninteresting and too nail-on-the-head. Even the opening scene -- in which the contemporary computersoftware genius is interacting with her software program and feeding it social cuesfeels Hollywood cutesy (she drinks liquor with a Twizzler in a Nora Ephron-esquetwist!).
The heart of the show should be the real romance she has with the nerd, a storyline
that works very well and will be even more effective when the unnecessary details arecarved away. Among the many great moments include the seamless transfer wherethe politician giving a speech becomes the Victorian inventor/madman and a dialogue
between the telephone Watson and a radio interviewer about his supportive role in
the great man's endeavor and why that's not embarrassing or sad.
But when timelines start to criss-cross towards the end and people from different eras
start to interact, it feels unnecessary and lazy. A lengthy final scene in which thecontemporary female scientist meets with her ex and tries to offer him closure is veryunsatisfying and goes against everything we know about both him and her. Ditto herneeding to dump her ideal partner simply because, well...it's too good? I never didquite catch that. A little doubt before committing to him would be fine, but anymorebeggars belief. And they do have the perfect ending. We see a scene where thecontemporary woman realizes she loves Watson and quotes that famous bit ofdialogue in a moment of self-awareness. It's good. But it's repeated a moment laterand would be more effective there alone.
The telephone Watson is interviewed and gives that lovely speech about helping
others achieve greatness. Then he's asked to deliver those famous first words. Hisresponse should be, "Oh no. I never delivered that line. My role is to listen. You mustsay the words." And then hand back the phone to the female interviewer who is nowall people who need companionship and love so she can say with affecting emotion,
"Watson, come here! I want you!"
What I need is to see a play that is so very full of promise take advantage of this
excellent first staging and be pruned and shaped even further so it can achieve itsgoal of greatness. What it needs, I guess, is a theatrical Watson.
THE NIGHT ALIVE  **
ATLANTIC THEATER
Conor McPherson is a marvelous playwright and a recent, pitch-perfect revival of The
Weir by Irish Rep reminded me of that strongly. So I eagerly came to see the US
premiere of his new work, which debuted at the Donmar in London. Unfortunately, itfeels incomplete, unsure of what it wants to be or say. Is it telling that the title of theplay -- The Night Alive  -- means no more to me after seeing it than it did before? I
think so. And the truism that the threat of violence is a lot scarier than actual violenceis also brought home.
The storyline, such as it is, is simple. Tommy (the marvelous Ciarin Hinds in top,</p>
<p>shambling form) lives rather abjectly in a slatternly room of a grand house in Dublin.
His mate Doc (Michael McElhatton) sneaks in through the window, hoping for a crisp
or two or sharing his own when he lucks into any. A mattress on the floor and somewhiskey from a bottle are the best you can hope from these two, who barely scrapeby.
But one night Tommy brings home Aimee (Caoilfhionn Dunne). We soon realize she's
penniless, desperate and a whore. But in Tommy's world, that still puts her a bit
above his station and he can only hope for some crumbs from her table, even as he
keeps a respectful distance and falls in love. Love in this case becomes a handjob for
some quick money (she won't do anything else!) but that's grand and suits Tommy
just fine. What does he want with all that bother?
This glimmer of intimacy in his dank world is interrupted only by the cantankerous
landlord, a besotted old fool Maurice (the great Jim Norton in a forgettable role), whocomplains about the mess and the noise of their music when he's not fallen downdrunk. He's the only interruption until Aimee's ex-boyfriend comes sniffing around,that is.
The play simply never came into focus as more than a modest character study. Thenit went off the rails. When Aimee's ex-boyfriend Kenneth (Brian Gleeson) barges in, hefinds the hapless, almost special needs person Doc. The highlight of the show is theirtense standoff as Kenneth keeps moving in on Doc, entering his personal space,racheting up the tension and then backing off, picking up a hammer as a silent threatthen handing it to Doc...before picking it up again. Gleeson and McElhatton are terrifichere. They should have kept the violence offstage, though unfortunately it begins infull view and unconvincingly as Kenneth taps Doc on the head with a hammer butthen really goes to town when they disappear from view into a bathroom.
SPOILER ALERTThat looming violence and the beat-down of Doc gives a jolt of immediacy to the play.
Sadly, it's followed by an even harder to swallow showdown where Tommy and
Aimee face off with Kenneth in a triangle and a violent struggle leads to a deadKenneth. This feels like a complete diversion from the central question of whetherAimee really wants Tommy the way he wants her. They spend a lot of time disposingof the body, with Tommy spinning an elaborate scheme to run away together. It'sperfectly believable when Aimee begs off and disappears. But in not one but two veryhard to swallow twists, the landlord Maurice suddenly decides to bequeath his hometo Tommy so Tommy and Doc have a home to live in forever. And at the last moment,a cleaned-up and sweet looking Aimee returns to display her true love for Tommy.
END OF SPOILER ALERTThese twists are thoroughly unconvincing and undercut the little we know about these
characters. There's a slight hint that heaven will be like life but with everything goingyour way. So perhaps Tommy is dead? I really don't think that's the intent but it's hardto make sense of the goings-on. I love Jim Norton's work so perhaps my confusionover his part (I thought he was the lead) made me especially disappointed in that roleas written. Maurice the landlord is almost a different person every time he returns tothe stage: complaining landlord, pathetic drunk, wealthy and superior man of
means/deus ex machina I think about covers it. None of them come to life, despite</p>
<p>Norton's best efforts.
Who is Doc? There's a suggestion he might be gay (though again, I don't think that's
really intended) and a hand he places intimately on Tommy's shoulder suggests it aswell, though he's practically mentally challenged at times, or perhaps that's justsweetness confused with stupidity. Aimee is the least defined of all, a gauzy idea of afallen woman who may or may not have a heart of gold. Only Tommy truly comes tolife: desperate, forceful, fighting, striving, needy but willing to help others in need aswell. Hinds does his best and when the writer Conor McPherson lets his play down,the director Conor McPherson is smart enough to cast great talent like Hinds and let
them do their all.
