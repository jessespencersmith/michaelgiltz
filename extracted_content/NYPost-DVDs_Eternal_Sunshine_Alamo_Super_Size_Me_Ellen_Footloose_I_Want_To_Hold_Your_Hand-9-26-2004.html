The Alamo 
Touchstone, $29.99 
Unconvincing is the first word 
that springs to mind to describe 
this umpteenth retelling of the 
last stand at the Alamo, where 
Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett 
perished. From Dennis Quaid's 
scowling first appearance as 
Sam Houston to the timid fmale 
when revenge isn't so sweet, 
none of it works. Some deleted 
scenes and a making-of 
documentary are here, but no 
hint of the much longer movie 
the filmmakers probably wanted 
to make. 
!'1Pfr Size Me 
Hart Sharp, $26.99 
With just a 
digital video 
camera and a 
clever idea -
eating nothing 
but McDonald's 
foramonth足
filmmaker and 
star Morgan 
Spurlock (right) ~~IIL_..!I 
delivered one of the most 
successful documentary films of 
all time. At the other extreme is 
the polished boxed set "Ken 
Burns' America" (PBS, $129.99), 
which compiles seven fme 
documentaries about the 
Brooklyn Bridge, the Statue of 
Liberty, etc. Burns is great, but 
his boxed sets are overpriced 
and poorly packaged. Eternal 
Sunshine of the ,0 less Mind 
It's easy to forget what 
a diverse, fascinating 
career Jim Carrey has . 
"Eternal Sunshine" is 
one ofthe best足
reviewed movies of the 
year (and the first time 
screenwriter Charlie 
Kaufman deepens a 
story with his 
elaborate, clever 
script). Also out: "In 
Living Color Season 
Two" (Fox, $49.98) 
shows Carrey at his 
comic best, and the 
1992 TV movie "Doing 
Time on Maple Drive" 
(Fox, $14.98) proved 
early on he could 
tackle drama. 
Ellen: Season One ** A&E,$39.95 
This gay roundup is led by TV's 
first lesbian star -who was so 
closeted, she didn't even know it 
herself. Ellen DeGeneres was 
always more appealing than her 
"Ellen" sitcom, and rewatching 
these so-so episodes proves it. 
The closeted Mormon in the 
pretty-good drama "Latter 
Days" (TLA, $24.99) knows it 
but can't admit it, and the 
oddball Comedy Central cult hit 
"Strangers with Candy: Season 
Three" (Paramount; $26.99) 
isn't technically gay, just gay-ish. 
Footloose ** Paramount, $14.99 
IWannaHold Your Hand *** Universal, $19.98 
Here are two movie musicals 
that met very different fates. 
"Footloose" became a smash 
in 1984 and made a star of 
Kevin Bacon, who provides 
commentary on the DVD. "I 
Wanna," 1978, is director 
Robert Zemeckis'sdelJghtful 
debut about teens in 1964-
desperate to get into "The Ed 
Sullivan Show" and see The 
Beatles. Zemeckis went on to 
"Back to the Future" and 
"Forrest Gump," but this gem 
is relatively unknown.</p>
