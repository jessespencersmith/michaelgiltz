THEATER: "Pump Girl" Finds A Gusher At Irish
Rep
PUMPGIRL  out of ****
IRISH  REPERTORY  THEATRE  
A strong, satisfying production of a strong, satisfying play and
precisely the sort of work that makes The Irish Rep so important. Takethis and their acclaimed O'Casey Cycle earlier this season and you'vegot reason enough to support this company for years to come.
The 2006 drama  Pumpgirl  and Irish playwright Abbie Spallen are
both new to me. The story centers around three people we slowly
realize are interconnected. They alternate monologues addressed tothe audience, but the overlapping plots and rising tension keep the
story pulsing along. These aren't set pieces that stand alone so much
as lonely voices that slowly merge into one confused cry of pain andneed.
It begins in a gas station in the North, but only just, as the program
notes put it. Pumpgirl is a tomboyish woman who works there, dealing
with obnoxious regulars but waiting for visits from her pal Hammy.Our second character is a man who competes at the local motorraceway when not avoiding the burden of his wife and kids. And thethird is a woman who dreads the moment each night her drunken
husband comes home, ping-ponging up the stairs and then slipping
into bed beside her, a bed with barbed wire strung right down thecenter.
The wife cheats on her husband with some random man at a local
market. Pumpgirl goes off with Hammy for quickies in his car. And the
cocky but lost lad who competes as a race car driver when not cleaningout bird shite at the local chicken farm (off the books of course, so thedole doesn't know) is both the husband and the "mate." He's thecentral, empty fact in both their lives amnd no happier on his own
then with either of them.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: "Pump Girl" Finds A
Gusher At Irish Rep</p>
<p>Photo ©2019 by Carol Rosegg
The cramped little theater at the basement level of the Irish Rep is
made full use of here. Set designer Yu-Hsuan Chen ably creates three
distinct spaces for each character, with the gas station brought to life
via a counter crammed with junk food like Tayto's and a diesel pump.Hammy has a car seat for his racing scenes and the many times hetakes Pumpgirl for a ride or just tries to escape his screwed up life. Andpropped against the wall stage right is the marital bed of Sinead. This
combines very well with the just-right costumes of Molly Seidel, the
crucial lighting of Michael O'Connor and the sound design of FanZhang, who smoothly works in everything from the music of GlennCampbell to bar sounds, a terrifying dream, the sounds of racing and
much more.
Full credit to director Nicola Murphy for marshalling that talent in
service of the text and a superb trio of actors. Labhaoise Magee isheart-rending as Pumpgirl, still hoping to hang out with her friend
after he's abused her trust in the most shameful way imaginable. Clare
O'Malley is equally good as the stronger Sinead, a woman who wakesup to her needs only to be blindsided by a husband who suddenlywants to mend his ways. What the bloody hell is up with that? Did hercheating subliminally stir his guilty conscience. And Hamish Allan-
Headley is an ideal Hammy, just good enough to be the handsome
stud of a small town without being so good-looking you can't quite buyit. He nails Hammy's conflicted combination of bad choices, regret,shame and yearning to maybe, maybe get something right for once. Ilook forward to seeing all three of them again, soon.
Towards the very end, the play gets quite a bit darker. For me, the
stakes were already high enough so I resisted this, even thoughnothing was out of whack with what came before. It's a smallreservation about Pumpgirl  itself, not the sterling and loving
presentation it's been given here.THEATER: "The Crucible" Is
