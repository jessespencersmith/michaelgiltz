10/04/2004 09:58:00 PMA fine New Yorker article by John Cassidy weaves together thedifficulties of achieving energy independence, our current quagmire,the hidden gas tax we pay via our Defense Department budget,President Carter's foreign policy that everyone has followed since andmuch more.One absurd fact:"A quicker and less costly way to conserve fuel would be to tighten upthe Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards, which President Fordintroduced. The fuel-efficiency requirements—27.5 miles per gallonfor cars; 21 miles per gallon for light trucks—have hardly beenraised since 1986. Moreover, many S.U.V.s are officially classed aslight trucks, which means they are subject to less stringentrequirements. If this loophole was closed, at least according to someestimates, demand for gasoline would drop by a million barrels aday—two-thirds of what we import from Saudi Arabia."We've done nothing to demand more fuel efficient cars in almost 20years and haven't closed the loophole involving SUVs, the mostpopular category today? That's insane.President Kerry (God willing) should call in the big auto makers andtell them it's their duty to the nation to do everything they can. Heshouldn't ask them, he should tell them they MUST improve fuelefficiency dramatically and make those cars widely available (they'renot keeping up with demand for hybrids).And Kerry should publicly tell them he'll inform the American peoplethat WHATEVER company introduces an affordable, significantly morefuel efficient car will get his endorsement that it's ourPATRIOTICDUTY to buy that car -- whether it's made by Ford or GM or Toyota orHyundai or Honda. And if the losers don't like it they can make onejust as competive themselves and he'll add it to the list. Just athought. And don't tell me this won't solve the problem. Every drop ofoil (and blood) counts.
