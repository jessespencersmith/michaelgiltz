Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayHave I ever read a novel about a wet nurse? I don't think I've ever seen them portrayed in depth even as asecondary character. It immediately seems an odd fact since author Lois Leveen mines such rich material from thesituation. She chooses one of the most famous wet nurses in history: the Nurse from "Romeo & Juliet." That rich,secondary character in one of Shakespeare's most popular plays comes fully to life here. And truly being a wet nurseis a very strange situation. In this case, the Nurse is a woman whose own child dies at birth the same night Juliet isborn. Though obviously still in mourning, she is whisked away to the home of one of the wealthiest families in Veronaand soon finds herself quite naturally developing the deepest affection for the child she raises from that momentonward. Drawing on details hinted at or left unexplored in the play, Leveen fleshes out this woman and her world,from her earthy and charming bee-keeper husband to Friar Laurence to the childhood behavior of Juliet, her devotedcousin Tybalt, the obnoxious Mercutio and more. Yes, these details amusingly refracture the tale as we know it. Butin truth, the novel is at its strongest in the first half when the tragedy is far in the future. As the book reaches its finaleand the shadow of Shakespeare's work looms larger, "Juliet's Nurse" feels less fresh. Still, much of it is original,strongly written, funny and quite fascinating. I'll never see a reference to a wet nurse again without wondering abouther story. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Lois Leveen’s richly detailed, fascinating novel offers a wholly original and intriguing take on one of Shakespeare’smost beloved plays through the imagined life of Juliet’s faithful nurse, whose secret loves and tragedies rival theyoung lovers’ own.” - Jennifer Chiaverini, author of Mrs. Lincoln's Rival"With the largest number of lines in Shakespeare's play after the two lovers, wet nurse Angelica takes center stage inLeveen's (The Secrets of Mary Bowser, 2012) second novel, which begins 14 years before the fateful five daysspanned by the drama... Leveen's enthusiastic historical novel pushes the classic teenage romance aside to givegreater weight to a mother's love and losses." - Kirkus Reviews“Wise, thoughtful,and utterly irresistible. A powerful story not just of youth seduced by love and destruction, but alsoof maturity left to pick up what is left and carry on.” - Eva Stachniak, Internationally bestselling author of TheWinter Palace and Empress of the Night“A beautifully written and sometimes chilling novel that’s deliciously sensual and fittingly dark. Juliet’s Nurse not onlyseems true to the classic but illuminates…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
