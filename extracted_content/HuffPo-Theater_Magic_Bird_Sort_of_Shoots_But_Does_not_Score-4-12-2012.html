 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Magic/Bird  Sort of Shoots,
But Doesn't Score
MAGIC/BIRD  * out of ****
LONGACRE THEATRE
Surprisingly, Magic/Bird  is the second  basketball-
themed show to hit Broadway recently. In many ways,
it's even less likely than the high school musical comedy
Lysistrata Jones.  It's an odd duck, no doubt about it.
But the mild curiosity over exactly what they're going to
put onstage to depict the careers and and friendship of
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird soon dissipates when its
dull, pseudo-documentary style reveals itself.
You can make a good documentary about Magic and Bird (in fact, HBO did). But having actors reenact
some public statements of these famous athletes while rotely going through their career highlights doesnot make good theater.
In fact, this play by Eric Simonson (who also authored the sports-themed Lombardi ) has all of two
scenes that offer even a little opportunity for drama. One involves the shooting of a TV commercial the
two athletes appeared in. They're in Bird's hometown and his mother insists Larry (Tug Coker) inviteEarvin (Kevin Daniels) over for lunch. As Bird's mom, Deirdre O'Connell is endearingly sweet and
straightforward as she bustles around preparing the meal, diving into basketball statistics and praising
Magic as one of her favorite players of all time. Compared to most of the show -- they played this game,they played that game, this team won this, that team lost that -- this is high drama. We get actualcharacters for a moment with Bird and Magic sparring gently, revealing themselves and telling stories.It's mild, but by gosh it feels like a three pointer.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>The other scene with some mild dramatic import tellingly involves neither of these athletes but fans in a
sports bar arguing over their favorite teams. Francois Battiste (who also has a blast doing Bryant
Gumbel) and Peter Scolari (in multiple roles, including coaches) get to play actual people, drunken men
who are passionate about their basketball and ready to argue and tease and mock each other. They alsoget to dance a little closer to the issues of race that the rivalry and the media portrayals of those two meninvariably raise. Both these scenes go by quickly but they stand out in this moribund work for actuallytrying to do what drama usually does: create characters and tell a story.The rest of the show is a dull recitation of facts with most of the excitement coming from old footage ofgreat games. Even that TV commercial provides more zing than most of the actual play. Simonson's piecetypically demonstrates a lack of drama by beginning with Johnson's announcement that he was HIVpositive and then barely hinting at the fact that Johnson was compulsively sleeping with hundreds if notthousands of women throughout his career. Think that might make for some interesting drama? Me too.
The show ends with the dull as dishwater Dream Team "triumph" at the Olympics that offers no tension
or excitement whatsoever. The actual drama of the All Star Game prior to that is similarly glossed over.
Many players rebelled over sharing a court with Johnson (who was elected by fans even though he'd
retired) out of unreasoning fear of AIDS. Bird stood by him. We hear about this, but only in passing and
Simonson doesn't begin to create conflict out of it.
Coker plays the monotone Bird to some amusing effect early on but it soon palls. Daniels has the easier
part of the more engaging Johnson but neither man has been given more than a few moments to digdeep. Not that it matters, but Coker sort of handles the ball and makes a few modest shots whereasDaniels looks like he's never even seen a basketball, much less dribbled one.
The set design by David Korins, the sound by Nevin Steinberg and the media design by Jeff Sugg all work
together nicely to present a sharp looking, clean production with all sorts of elements like old stills, game
footage and the noise of crowds blended together in an unobtrusive manner. If there were an actual play
going on, their work would be providing fine support. They did come up with a clever touch in this piece
directed by Thomas Kail ( Lombardi  and In The Heights ). The cast is introduced as if they're players
taking the field. It's a cute moment at the very beginning. Unfortunately, it turns out to be one of the few
instances of originality in the entire piece. Anyone looking to ease the pain of going cold turkey on
Linsanity should stick to reruns on ESPN Classic.
