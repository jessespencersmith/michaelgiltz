"MASTER AND COMMANDER: 
THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD" 
Director Peter Weir's grand vision of Lucky Jack Aubrey 
(Russell Crowe) leading his men into battle during the Na­
poleonic Wars ($39.98, Fox) deserves tbe broad canvas of a 
big screen. But the very attributes that kept it [rom becoming 
a blockbuster -subtle acting from Crowe and Paul Bettany 
(as his surgeon), a fine eye for detail and a resistance to 
pumped-up set pieces -make it ideal for home viewing. 
With loads extras -lengthy documentaries, deleted scenes 
and even a map -is it too much to hope huge DVD sales will 
let them make a sequel? 
"THE OFfICE": COMPLETE SECOND SERIES 
Painfully funny, this BBC series about the workers at a mis­
erable little paper products company ($24.98, BBC Video) be­
came the first international comedy to win Golden Globes for 
Best Comedy and Best Actor (for co-creator and star Rick)' 
Gervais). The second season ended with gut-wrenching emo­
tion. Extras -including deleted scenes. bloopers and a video 
diary -ease the pain of knowing "The Office" is almost 
closed for good (only two new episodes are on tap). 
"THE INGMAR BERGMAN COlLECTION" 
"FLOAnfm WEEDS" 
Although the five lngmar Bergman films in this collection 
-"Persona," "Hour of the Wolf," "Shame," "Passion of 
Anna" and "The Serpent's Egg" -are available individually, 
this boxed set ($112.96, MGM) includes a sixth disc of extras, 
including a Swedish IIconversation" \vith Bergman from 2002 
and a 1970 English interview. Meanwhile, the 100th birthday 
celebration of the legendary Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu 
is marked by a lovely packaging of his 1934 silent film "A 
Story of Floating Weeds" along with his 1959 remake, "Float­
ing Weeds" ($39.95; Criterion) . The latter features audio 
commentary by Roger Ebet1. 
"I LEAGUE OF THEIR owr.!" 
,Vho says l\ladonna can't act? Whether it's her debut in 
"Desperately Seeking Susan," her wisecracking moll in "Dick 
Tracy," her Golden Globe-winning turn as Argentina's 
"Evita" or her hilarious work in 1992's «A League of Their 
Own" ($24.96; Columbia TriStar), Madonna has delivered 
some sterling work. Loads of extras, like commentar y from 
director Penny Marshall, a documentary and 15 deleted 
scenes. 
Also out: 
The Daryl Hannah revival gains speed with "Kill Bill: Vol. 
2" in the theaters and the fine J ahn Sayies drama "Casa De 
Los Babvs" ($29.98, MGM) on DVD; "Win a Date With 
Tad Hamnton!" ($26.99, Universal) is fatally miscast -if a 
movie star is supposed to fall in love with an average girl, she 
shouldn't look like runway model Kate Bosworth; Christo­
pher Walken's incendiary 1990 drama "King of New York" 
Special Editioll ($19.98, Artisan); Oiiver North runs for the 
U.S. Senate in the observant 1996 documentarv "A Perfect 
Candidate" ($24.95. First Run); "Spinal Tap" heavy-metal in­
spiration Slade in their one and only rockumentary, 1974's 
"Slade in Flame" ($19.98, Shout). 
Tim Burton's fantasy drama "Big Fish," Hugh Grant as the 
Prime Minister in "Love Actually." and the WolfMan Leg­
acy Collection.</p>
