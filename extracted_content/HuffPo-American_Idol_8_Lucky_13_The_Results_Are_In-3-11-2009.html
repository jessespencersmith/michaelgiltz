 American Idol  -- Lucky 13: The
Results Are In
Read More:  American Idol , Pop Music , Reality TV , Entertainment
News
UPDATE:
Ok, the results are in and Jasmine Murray and
Jorge Nunez are going home. I'm batting 50/50,since I picked Jasmine and Anoop to go homeand Jasmine did and Anoop may have been in thebottom four when they faced him off with Jorge.Anoop definitely dodged a bullet and I don'tthink any of them (including Megan, who waspaired off with Jasmine) would have challenged
for the top prize. Expect the rest to go in coming weeks.
The ratings were strong as well. According to Marc Berman of Mediaweek , Idol  scored a 14.7 in the
ratings  and was the top-rated show of the night. It was down 10% from a year ago, but that's far
better than the 17% drop of Tuesday's show. Thanks to the tweaks in the rules and a strong lineup
of talent, the results shows seem to be scoring higher than usual. People are voting in much higher
numbers and paying closer attention because -- unlike the judges -- America believes this
competition is wide open.
The new twist is a modest and reasonable one meant to prevent a travesty like the early departures
of Jennifer Hudson and Chris Daughtry. If the judges think someone has been cut wrongly, theycan unanimously declare a Save and that person will remain. However, the following week, TWOpeople must go home. The judges can only use this Save one time and then that's it for the rest ofthe season. I expect it might come into play once we get closer to the final six or so. Wednesday, theonly effect is an awkward one where the judges have to tell someone who's already been told he'slost that, yes, he's still going home. Not exactly heart-warming, though both jasmine and Jorgemaintained their dignity. Anoop, meanwhile, was convinced he was going home and had a look ofresigned disappointment the entire night.
The show began with Ryan Seacrest announcing that a record 33 million votes were cast (a record
for this stage of the competition, that is). Then they detailed the new twist, showed the mansion

a #1 hit at that) for the Jackson 5. Danny Gokey was given a dance solo, a cute recognition of how
spastic his unchoreographed dancing was the night before.
Then they went through the contestants (with Kris getting a notable number of squeals), paired off
Jasmine and Megan and then sent Jasmine home.
Kanye West came out and sang his hit single "Heartless," his Top 2 hit that's been on the charts for
over four months. He just leaves me cold, frankly, despite some good singles.He had a giant towel
hanging out of his back pocket (maybe bandanas are too gay?) which looked dorky but I loved the
female backup singer wearing a dress straight out of Dune  or Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.
Then they paired off Anoop and Jorge.
Kelly Clarkson came out and sang her #1 hit "My Life Would Suck Without You" which has only
been on the charts for seven weeks. I would have thought both singers would have performed theirnext  hit single. Still, Kelly's song is a great record -- and another example of a song that is terrific
fun but not terribly interesting for others to cover (take note, future Idol  wannabes.) Kelly was
sweet and unassuming as always and happily still looks like a healthy young woman rather than astick figure a la so many rail-thin female celebrities. Jorge was sent home with the judges taking apass and he watched his journey to the tune of Carrie Underwood singing her new single "HomeSweet Home."
Carrie's a huge credit to the show as well, but Kelly's appearance reminded me that the best thing
that ever happened to American Idol  was Kelly Clarkson. She gave the show immediate credibility
by achieving commercial and critical success and then building on it with three more albums -- andshe did it all while being true to the show's heartland appeal by not wigging out or embarrassing
herself with tabloid antics.
So what did you think of the new rule twist and did you think it was right for Jasmine and Jorge to
go home?
ORIGINAL POST:OK, first things first: Michael Jackson's Thriller  has NOT sold 100 million copies worldwide. When
Thriller  was reissued very successfully last year, Michael Jackson's camp just started telling
everyone Thriller had sold more than 100 million copies worldwide, which was about 30 million
copies more than anyone had ever claimed for it before. Their source? None. They just kept sayingit and the number sounded so overwhelming, people just repeated it, starting perhaps with Ebonymagazine, which had an interview with Jackson and then continued by everyone else. Now, theJackson camp -- and Wikipedia -- just quote the magazines and TV shows that repeated thisimaginary figure as "proof" that it's true. The sad part of this is that Thriller  is indeed the best-
selling album worldwide of all time, which makes the fact that Jackson feels the need to lie abouthis sales record even sadder. I seem to recall that when Bad  was released, Rolling Stone did a
profile of Jackson and said he had written the number "100" on his bathroom mirror because thatwas his goal for the followup to Thriller : to sell 100 million copies worldwide. That didn't happen,
of course so know Jackson is apparently trying to make it happen by just pretending it did. Thefact is that Thriller  has sold 28 million copies in the US as of 2008, per the Recording Industry
Association of America. (The Eagles have a greatest hits package that has sold 29 million copies,but Thriller  is still the #1 selling album of original material here.) It had long been reported that
the album had sold 40 million copies overseas, but overseas figures are hard to come by. TheGuinness Book Of World Records devotes a great deal of time and resources to its research and hasdeclared that it can confirm Thriller  sold 67 million copies total worldwide -- making it the top-
selling album of all time. If I look at Thriller 's sales in the US, which have gone from 20 million to
28 million in the past 20+ years and imagine overseas sales have kept pace, that brings us to agenerous 80 million copies worldwide. That's still 20 million copies LESS than what Jacksonclaims. But Guinness is the best source for worldwide sales and they say 67 million copies. That's#1 and that should be enough for anyone.
On to the show featuring the Top 13,  which impressed me greatly. ( Michael Slezak of Enterainment
Weekly  agrees .) I thought the Wild Card show was especially weak but Tuesday night's show had
some very strong performances. Despite the judges losing their cool over Adam Lambert,  which

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol -- Lucky 13: The Results Are In
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----luck_b_173916.html[4/2/2009 9:25:12 PM]Entertainment Weekly insists sounded better in person than on TV  and Paula's claim that Adam
and Danny Gokey would face each other in the finals, it seems pretty wide open to me, thanks to
Lil Rounds and a handful of others.
The ratings were strong, averaging a 14.1 rating. As Marc Berman of Mediaweek points out, that's
down 17% from last season...but so are most other shows and Idol  is still far bigger than anything
else on TV right now.
I loved that the theme was Michael Jackson songs, since Kara had declared during auditions that
NO ONE sings those songs. No one. (She said the same about the Police.) So how could you have anight devoted to Michael Jackson? Kara also sported some crazy bow on her dress while Paulacountered with feathers.
LIL ROUNDS  -- She kicked off the night when the show was scoring a 12.4 rating. By 9:30, the
show hit 15.2 in the ratings, which just goes to show what a disadvantage it is to go first. But that
shouldn't stop Lil, who absolutely blew me away singing "The Way You Make Me Feel," the third of
five #1 hits in a row from Bad. Lil was amazing -- perfectly in pitch at every moment, faithful to the
melody but giving the song her own less pop more soulful spin and completely in command. My
friend Aaron hated what she was wearing, just like Simon, but I thought it was fine except for the
big flouncy stuff on one shoulder. She could have performed that at the finals, I thought. The
judges raved, mostly, with Randy saying -- yet again -- "This is the way we kick off season eight!" --
and Simon praising her but calling it a "lazy" song choice. Kara tried to get down again, by saying,
"Good job, y'all."
SCOTT MACINTYRE  -- He sang "Keep The Faith," which is an album track from Dangerous and
not a single, which makes it an obscurity by Michael Jackson standards. Personally, I didn't even
remember the song, which falls into the treacly positivity of "Man In The Mirror" and "Heal TheWorld" tunes. MacIntyre was indeed far far better when sitting and playing the piano then before.But before he didn't belong on the show at all and now he just seems like one of the weakest of thebunch, especially when he tried to get soulful on the bridge and wailed away. Kara tried to shut upthe crowd's cheering a tad too early for my taste (I'm really giving her a hard time, I know) but thejudges were surprisingly mixed for a change, with Kara and Paula polite but Randy and Simonmixed with Simon -- hilariously -- saying he hated the song (really, he meant the song choice of an"obscure" tune) even though Paula had just said that Siedah Garrett, who wrote it, was in theaudience. No wonder Huffington Poster Rubaum-Keller says she likes Simon for speaking bluntly.An unknown song and poor reviews from the judges so early in the night could spell trouble forMacIntyre.
DANNY GOKEY  -- Gokey -- aka Robert Downey Jr. Jr. -- sang one of my favorite tunes from
Thriller, the infectious single "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)," which only hit #10, making it the
lowest charting tune of all the seven songs released off that album. (It didn't even hit the Top 10 inthe UK.) Gokey was so-so on the soulful, slow intro but really came into his own when theperformance quickly turned upbeat. He did indeed look manic on stage as the judges pointed out(and that jacket made him look like an English lit professor), but his voice sounded great. Butstagecraft can be improved while vocal talent cannot and he's got that in spades. When callingafter the show, his number was the only one I got a busy signal on and it happened repeatedly.Unscientific, of course, but there you are.
MICHAEL SARVER  -- Sarver sang what remains for the moment the last #1 song if Michael
Jackson's career: "You Are Not Alone," which hit the top of the charts back in 1995. Sarver sounded
awkward to me throughout, with the slow pace of the song revealing his limitations once and forall. He sounded mannered and odd throughout and also had something splattered on the back ofhis jacket. The judges mostly praised him, though Kara pointed out that he's not the best singer.Randy said Sarver was "one of the best so far," which -- since he was only the fourth performer --means I guess that he's better than MacIntyre.
JASMINE MURRAY  -- This sweet and very pretty girl sang "I'll Be There," the biggest hit by the
Jackson Five and their last #1 hit, where it stayed for five weeks. Of course it was also a #1 hit for
Mariah Carey, who duetted on the tune with Trey Lorenz for MTV Unplugged. Lorenz had a Top 20hit later that year (in 1992) with "Someone To Hold," which Carey co-wrote and co-produced butafter that Lorenz was never heard from again. Murray is adorable and talented, but the truth is shewas rough on the low notes, her attempt to riff was weak, her big moments were a tad sharp andmostly I was just waiting for the song to begin. The judges were polite but mixed at best, with Karabizarrely suggesting Murray should have sung the song in an even lower register.
KRIS ALLEN  -- Allen -- aka David Archuleta Sr. -- looked awfully cute as he brought out his

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol -- Lucky 13: The Results Are In
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----luck_b_173916.html[4/2/2009 9:25:12 PM]acoustic guitar and strummed away during "Remember The Time," which hit #3 for an unusual
four weeks back in 1992, right before Carey would chart with her remake of "Ill Be There." I reallyenjoyed Allen's smooth performance. His guitar playing was negligible since we couldn't even hearit, but it was indeed very Jason Mraz-y as Randy said or John Mayer-ish as I thought. Best of all, Iwasn't thinking of it as a Michael Jackson tune as he performed it but just as a good song. Andagain, he's awfully cute. The women loved him while the men were a little mixed, with Simonrightly and hilariously saying Kris should have held off on mentioning he was married for a fewmore weeks to keep the female voters more hopeful. Paula -- who was focused and prepared, asshe's been all season -- oddly prefaced calling him adorable/sexy by saying "don't take this thewrong way." What bad way could that be taken?
ALLISON IRAHETA  -- Looking very rocker-ish, Iraheta sang "Give In To Me," another album
track (ie. not a single) from Dangerous. It came out before she was born but no one complained
about the song being unfamiliar because Iraheta did such a terrific job with it. All four judges raved
about the 16 year old and rightly so.
ANOOP DESAI  -- In the evening's low point by far, Anoop took his posturing on "My Perogative"
one step further and tried to look tough while performing "Beat It" (the #1 hit featuring Eddie Van
Halen on guitar). He was about as convincing as Laura Bush was when it came to ending gang
violence. In fact, when he made a defiant stare at the crowd at the end (which I kept waiting for
him to turn into an abashed grin), I realized Anoop was channeling Kanye West with all his ego. He
also seemed to garble the lyrics at one point, but the judges were so harsh they didn't bother to
mention it. Paula said the song was "untouchable" (which seemed a tacky thing to say to a personof Indian descent, but I digress). To be more specific, it's not untouchable so much asuninteresting to cover. "Beat It" is a great record but not a great song. This is the same confusionthat reigns every year at the Grammys when they award one tune as Record Of The Year andanother as Song Of The Year. A great record, like say M's "Pop Muzik" or Jackson's "Thriller" canbe a terrific tune, but you don't really want to hear other people record their own versions of it.Another example: the Village People's "Macho Man." Maybe a blast of a song, but does anyone elseever need to do a new version of it? Nope. The Song Of The Year is a tune you DO want to hearother people record over the years, such as "Yesterday" by the Beatles. A great record -- like theBeach Boys' "GOod Vibrations" -- is terrific, but it's been done and never needs to be done again. Agreat song can and should be covered by other artists. Anoop is going home and his sideswipedexpression by the time the judges were done showed he knows it too.
JORGE NUNEZ  -- He sang "Never Can Say Goodbye," which hit #2 for three weeks back in 1971
and prompted the biggest disconnect between me and the judges. I've never been a huge fan of
Jorge but he seems a classic Idol contestant to me, especially in his song choices and performance.I thought he was good, with his English pronunciation better than ever and Nunez especially goodon the upbeat sections, which I thought he nailed. Top it off with a big note or two and I thoughthe was safe. But the judges were still spoiling for a fight after Anoop and piled on, albeit not asstrongly.
MEGAN JOY CORKREY  -- She looked absolutely lovely and sang the second hit single by
Michael as a solo artist (albeit while still in the Jackson 5), "Rockin' Robin," which is practically a
novelty number. She danced around awkwardly again, had a bad last note and then topped it offby saying "Caw! Caw!" which made me burst out laighing. At least she's having fun and not takingherself too seriously. But the judges were mostly negative with Megan having to hope her looksand the relative paucity of women will keep her alive for another week. (Thanks DCDan forpointing out my error on the song.)
ADAM LAMBERT  -- The judges went into a meltdown of excitement over Lambert, who sang
"Black Or White," which is -- perhaps surprisingly -- tied for the biggest hit of Jackson's career,
since it was #1 for seven weeks, just like the landmark tune "Billie Jean." if as the judges say youmust be over-the-top to sing this song, then Lambert succeeded since he wailed and ululated hisway throughout the number, aided by strobe lights and other flashy effects by the show'sproducers. Personally, I thought it was a bit draggy and the Members Only-looking jacket awful.But he'll kill it on KISS theme week. The judges were even more over the top in their praise, withPaula predicting a Lambert-Gokey finale, which I think Lil Rounds is gonna have something to sayabout. Their attitude did seem inappropriate since we've just started the Top 13 and they'vepraised Gokey and Lil Rounds as well. But when Simon chided Paula, she rightly reminded Simonthat he kept saying Carrie Underwood would win it all even before the show began airing.
MATT GIRAUD -- The dueling piano player sang and played the piano on "Human Nature"
another great song off Thriller, which may not have sold 100 million copies worldwide but is</p>

And...indeed a great album. This tune in particular is sensational with a melody so beguiling it's been
covered by Miles Davis among many others. Giraud was OK, at best, though he didn't embarrasshimself on that tricky high run of vocal riffing. But the judges gave him a pass and said nice thingsall around.
ALEXIS GRACE  -- Ryan Seacrest stepped on Matt's moment a bit by urging people to write down
the phone number for the next contestant because they would not want to miss it. But in fact,
Seacrest was just trying to emphasize that Alexis's number was NOT the one you would expect
since that number was taken by a phone sex hotline. She performed "Dirty Diana," the fifth #1 hit
from Bad. With her short skirt and naughty attitude, Alexis's transformation from nice girl to
dirrrrty girl was certainly complete though Paula rightly warned her against oversinging.
Surprisingly, the women liked her more than the men. But I sort of liked her if not exactly this
whole performance, although I'm worried that the confusion over her number might hold her back.
OK< so who goes home? Me, I would happily say goodbye to: Scott MacIntyre, Michael Sarver,
Anoop Desai, Megan Joy Corkrey, and Matt Giraud. I also think Jasmine Murray and Alexis Grace
are in danger, along with Jorge Nunez. I'm pretty sure these will be the people to fall in the next six
weeks, with a final four of Lil Rounds, Danny Gokey, Adam Lambert and a person to be decided all
but certain. Tonight the promised change in rules might include the bottom person going and the
next two having a sing-off to be decided by the judges. I hope that's not the case since letting the
audience vote for their favorites is a signature part of the show.
So assuming there's a bottom three, I think it will be Anoop Desai, Michael Sarver and Jasmine
Murray (though I almost wrote Megan but her performance was so oddball I think people willremember it and memorably bad is better than forgettable). I think Anoop and Jasmine Murrayare going home. But don't be upset about who goes home: as long as LIl, Gokey and Lambert arethere, it doesn't matter what order the others fall.
So who did you like and who do you think is going home? Any ideas about what change to the rules
they'll introduce tonight? I liked the live decision by the judges for the Wild Card but I hate it ifthey're gonna do it every week.

Megan, a beautiful girl with no discernible singing talent, who for the life of me I cannot understand why
she would disfigure herself with an entire arm tattoo. I do wonder what these colorful tattoos will looklike once these young women reach their 40s - and as they go into their 50s, they will be in for astarling surprise as to how everything about their skin tone will change with menopause and that thereis nothing they can do to prevent the sagging, or the paper-like thinness. I know it's a fad,but it's apermanent fad that they can enjoy for about the next 20 years, but which eventually, I believe, they willregret. I'm 61 now - and even without tattoos, you have absolutely no idea how your skin tone changesuntil you are there and living it.
End of sermon. (She still can't sing.)

singer/songwriter...not an Idol. So if he gets top seven, I'd say he'd be doing very well. Being
that he was a WC.

As I mentioned below, comments by you and others made me give Matt a second listen and
he was more solid than I originally thought. Maybe he'll keep improving in weeks to come and
you can trumpet your early support.

Hilarious that Paula can warn anyone of "oversinging". At least they are really singing, Paula!!
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Funny, though I don't believe Paula was ever accused of being a front for other singers a la
Milli Vanilli, though she certainly lip synced in concerts since her shows were heavy onchoreography and it's very very hard to sing and dance for two hours solid when you'recenter stage.

One of Paula's back up singers or studio singers publicly claimed that Paula did verylittle of her own singing on her albums. I'm just pulling this from memory, so I'm not
sure if the back up singer claimed it was for only one song or for all of Paula's
released albums. This was such a scandal at the time that I remember a big press
conference where Paula countered that she did her own singing. So, Paula, too,
has had her own Milli Vanilli moment.

I thought Allison was the best girl of the night but I think she will be in Bottom 3 along with Jorge (who I
also liked) and Jasmine.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Yeah, Allison was great. I'd call it a tie between her and Lil but she was indeed a standout.

IMHO, Adam must have been grown in a test tube, his DNA specifically encoded for the purpose ofachieving ultimate pop stardom via American Idol, a show designed and developed to herald the arrivalof this man made creature. There's nothing organic about him, it's all electrodes, test tubes, gears andwires, on a genetically designed framework. They threw in a little Elvis Presley, a little Michael Jackson,some Beatle hair, a bit of Steven Tyler's voice, the mind control abilities of Saturn Girl, and themanners of Kyle XY. No doubt his hatch day coincided with all the proper astrological convergences.Even sane and thoughtful people have been heard to say, "I love him!" 
To get the real comparison, put him next to Gorky and Megan, who are as organic, authentic and
natural as can be. 
Guess which one America will prefer! (Hint: neither of the organic ones, unless Lambert's sequencing
misfires at an inopportune time)

The Kyle XY comparison was especially funny. Thx for reading and commenting.

I do think that Adam could do an awesome Elvis impersonation. He really looks like him,,the
little snarl, and the dyed black hair, he reminds me of the King every time I see him.
ScottR See Profile  I'm a Fan of ScottR  permalink
I agreed for the most part, but I thought Matt did better than you think he did. If I had to call it today, Iwould go with Gokey. I also thought Jorge did pretty well, but Anoop sucked and Sarver wasforgettable. I bet they fall tonight.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
You know,you're right. I listened to his performance again and he was better than I originallythought. Still don't think he'll challenge for the top prize but I look forward to seeing if he'll
keep improving.

Michael, once agaIn, thanks for a Joel Whitburn-y review of last nights show - I always find you fun and
informative, but as a fellow homo I feel something needs to be addressed. I have been reading themessage boards on several sights and it seems that much of the Lambert-dissing is homophobic innature. "Theatrical" is a code to many people for gay, and I feel that's what is being done. You can tellby my screen name that I'm a bit older, but my life would have been a lot easier if someone positive(attitude, not medical) like Adam had been on television. Ultimately what will happen in a Gokey-
Lambert face-off will be a red state/blue state match-up with a "church choir director" vs. a "theatrical
flamboyant rocker." And before I get booed by the Palin types ("I'm not homophobic, I know a gay
person!") just chew on it for a while.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Hey Furry, thanks for reading. I figure since there are out eight zillion reviews of the show out
there that I can set mine apart a tad by providing some music trivia and background.(Obviously, I'm the only one exercised by Jackson's claim of selling 100 million copies.) Ispend too much time on Idol as it is so I don't read the message boards too much. Certainly"theatrical" is often code for gay. Adam would be more positive in my mind -- assuming he isgay -- if he were out. And if you can't be out when you're working in musical theater, when theheck can you be out? :) But the nice thing is he is being himself at least performance wiseand clearly has strong support from the judges and has lots of fans. If it comes down to redstate vs blue state, hey Obama won so maybe Lambert will too. Me, I think it's far from clear
who the final two will be, given Lil and Allison and even one or two others. Adam is getting
great exposure, so let's enjoy that rather than some catty comments by people who think theyknow who he is.
ScottR See Profile  I'm a Fan of ScottR  permalink
I understand the concern about "theatrical" being code for gay. But to me it means he wastoo big, his gestures too obvious. He looked like Travolta doing a choreographed number. Hismoments when he connected to the song and became passionate were good, but otherwisehe was just too big. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I too hated his clothes and hishaircut is annoying and seems patently calculated to come across as hip, which all the judgesbuy hook-line and sinker.

Good review Michael. I thought the show was good. Maybe a 7. I think it was a good idea to havesome of the judges favorites go first so some that some of the others get a chance to be remembered.No one is going to forget Lil or Danny, so it really doesn't matter when they perform. 
My favorites last night: Danny: loved the terrible dancing! It made him seem more down-to-earth;

Allison: HUGE potential; Kris: when the song started i thought "Corny!!" but he won me over and I
actually re-wound to watch again. I agree that Adam wasn't as good as the judges thought. He probablywill make the finals, but when the judges gush over performances that aren't that great, they lose
credibility in my opinion. 
Bottom 3: Michael, Megan, Anoop. I really want Anoop to make the tour, but after last night it's not
looking too good. If the twist is that the judges pick one or both people that go home, I see bothMichael and Anoop going. We'll see!!
Ohsnap See Profile  I'm a Fan of Ohsnap  permalink
I am going with a boy-trifecta...Lambert, Gokey, Anoop. There certainly can't be enoughstarry-eyed teenage girls to get both Lambert and Kris into the top 3, can there?
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
No, I don't think so. But do you really think Anoop will survive that long?
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I was really impressed by Allison as well. Def a dark horse. Thx for reading.

I agree with most of your commentary and greet Anoop is in the most trouble tonight. I also don't see17-year-old Jasmine M going very far. Perhaps she'll be cut tonight as well. 
I'm glad you pointed out that, supposedly, Adam L sounds better live because I am beffudled by the
fanaticism over his vocals. To me, he seems ultra screechy. About as pleasant and fun as listening toSam Harris from Star Search. 
One thing though, both you and Seacrest got it wrong on "Rockin' Robin." It wasn't a J5 single at all. It
was MJ's second-ever solo single, albeit released in 1972 when the J5 were still a group. It was also
included on his debut solo "Got To Be There" LP.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Omigosh, you're absolutely right about Michael Jackson and Rockin' Robin, which I've
corrected in the piece. Dumb mistake since I had my Billboard charts book open to Michaeljackson but had to turn the page for Jackson 5 info. Also, everyone please note that I hadchanged my mind about who is going home and made it Anoop and Jasmine. Apparently myupdate didn't register and still reads as Anoop and Michael Sarver.
