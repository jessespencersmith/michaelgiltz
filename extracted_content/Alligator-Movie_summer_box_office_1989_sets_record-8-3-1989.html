The audience is always right, 1989 has turned out to be the highest 
grossing summer in movie history and before a single flick had been 
screened, people knew what to expect. -, , 
During the opening weekend of Indiana Jones and the ~ast Crusa~e -,; 
which was the first blockb~ste l in a: str'ihg af.fi\iElt; 'theater owrfers' ::-. 
serenaded movie-goers with a stri'ng of upcoming releases_ They 
applauded Honey, I Shrunk The Kids and hissed at Karate Kid Ill, But it 
was the mere mention Of l!~t~~.!hat ~.roug ,ht a ,roar of approval. 
The Caped Crusader has clearly dominated North America's 23,000 
screens, Opening in about 1O.percent .~f th~m, ~a~m9 ~ has "s~q~p'e? I?as,t

hit of all time, passing past champs The Exorcist and Superman , Once 
the receipts for all the bat-merchandise is added in, Batman could 
generate up to $1 billion, 
But it's far from alone in the money-makil'\g department_ Director" 
Tim Burton's slightly dark take on Batman is at the top 'of a very 
profitable heap of blockbusters: This -summer's slate of movies has

<p>pushed Hollywood's take for the year to $2.8 
billion, which is 5300 million to $400 million 
ahead of 1988, the biggest year of all time. 
And there's no end in sight. Tom Hank's 
Turner and Hooch opened very strongly and When 
/larry Met Sally... should gross a respectabl e 
530 million -a nice pay check for a low-key 
romantic comedy. 
But the main event is stUl to come. The Abyss 
was pelayed from its original opening because 
of the complex special effects involved in the 
underwater epiC. James (Aliens, The Terminator ) 
. Cameron's movie finally will premiere on 
Wednesday. It remains the last and best chance 
for a gFeat summer movie to emerge from a 
season that's generated a lot of money but little 
to get truly excited about. 
Here for your perusal· is a run­
down of the winners and losers, 
both commercially and critically. 
THE BLOCKBUSTERS 
Batman -A blockbuster is gen­
erally considered to be a movie that 
has grossed over 5100 million, so 
this sequel in the making could 
count as two m· hits. T 
not really satisfying. Keaton and 
Nicholson are wonderful, but the 
adult tone is marred by a dopey 
romance. Moranis had the pleasure of appearing in two 
really bad movies that made buckets of money 
(see Ghostbusters m. At least they had the good 
taste to tag on a cartoon at the beginning . Please, 
no one give them any bright ideas such as Bette 
Midler in The Absent-minded Professorette or 
Herbie the Love Bug Goes to Toon Town. 
Ghostbusters II -No movie that grosses $100 
million can be termed a commercial bust, but 
this comes close. The original was one of the 10 
biggest hits of all time, not to mention inventive , 
intelligent and a great comedy. But this is a 
picture-perfect example of why sequels are gen­
erally a bad idea. It's the same story and the 
same jokes but without the same appeal. The 
difficulty here is to not let Ghostbusters II dim 
your pleasure of the original. Remember, Rocky 
is still a great movie, too. 
THE MAJOR HITS 
Dead Poets Society -
The most enjoyable movie 
of the summer, this nicely 
acted m elodrama 
charmed everyone . Yes, 
the plot was manipul a­
tive, but the acting and 
direction were to'fMlOMh. 
Robin Williams solidified 
his position as a major 
star by, oddly enough, ac­
cepting what amounts to • 
It secondary rale. 
Do The Right Thing -A big factor in the movie's suc­
cess is the wildly popular Buggin Out (Ciancar/o Esposito) 
soundtrack by Prince, which is 
lodged at number one on the Billboard album 
charts. Everyone benefited from it: Prince was 
given a commercia l shot in the arm and Batman 
received the funkiest promotional trailer ever 
with the hit song "Batdance ." 
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade -
Spielberg's magic touch continues with the third 
and final installment of the Indiana Jones tril­
ogy. It has grossed about $170 million in North 
A merica and will surely repeat that success 
overseas. Families came in droves to see the 
closest thing to a Saturday afternoon serial. 
While certainly entertaining, Crusade was nei­
ther as breathtakingly ne",: as Raiders nor as 
scary as The Temple of Doom. 
Lethal Weapon II -The chemistry between 
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover hasJTIad e this 
sequel one of the few movies to gross more 
money than the hit that spawned it. The original 
Weapon made about 570 million, but this will 
pass 5100 million soon -no thanks to the 
Philadelphia court system. A judge there has 
ordered jurors for an international money laun­
dering trial to avoid the Warner Bros. release 
because-it deals with the same topic and might 
prejudice them. 
Where does such thinking end? Should jurors 
in a trial involving racism be barred from seeing 
Do The Right Thing? Is Licence To Kill detrimental 
to anyone trying to remain impartial in a drug 
case? Why not simplify the process? Ban from 
the courtroom anyone who saw and enjoyed The 
Karate Kid TIl and just assume everyone else is 
intelligent enough to separate fact from fiction. 
Honey, I Shrunk The Kids -Disney returned 
fo its simple-minded idea of good, clean family 
fun and made $100 million in the rocess. Rick 
4, APPtA USE, THURSDAY AUGUST 3 Because of its small bud­
get, this hil~rious comedy by Spike lAe shoul. 
be considered a major success even though it 
will only gross about 520 million. Funny, sharp 
and aggressive , it marks a major step forward 
for Lee. One of the best of the year. 
THE BOMBS 
Karate Kid III -Here's a sad story: When 
Ralph Macchio was offered a starring role in the 
first Karate Kid, a clause in his contract forced</p>
<p>o

P

en 
he 
ed him to agree to two sequels if Columbia Pictures 
wished to make them. Being an unknown actor, 
Macchio had to sign on the dotted line or throw 
away his shot at the big time. 
Keep in mind, the originaI J~ 'was a good 
film that any young actor would have killed to 
be in. So don't blame him for Kid Ill, which died 
quickly after a strong opening weekend. Its 
gross of $30 million is a far cry from the $110 
million of Karate Kid II. Here's hoping ClHumbia 
paid through the nose to get it made. 
Star Trek V: The Final Frontier -It might 
have passed as a decent episode of the series, but as a major motion picture, 
fitfully amusing and ends with a 
worst since the pretentious Star Tr: 
Picture and will stall at $50 millio is is slow, 
ud. It's the

Licence To Kill -No Bond m ie will ever 
lose money -they're a staple in fo ign markets 
and have a guaranteed base of i erest in the 
U.S. In Britain, Licence got off to e strongest 
start of any Bond flick yet. But he it will only 
pull in about $30 million. 
That's t,oo bad, because Dalton is doing a good 
job of toughening up 007's tattered image after 
the silly, self-mocking tone of View To A Kill, etc. No more cartoon violence for this anti-hero : 
when he kills someone in Licence, it's ugly. 
Pink Cadillac -This Clint Eastwood vehicle 
died a qUick and painful death at the box office. 
Even Eastwood fans didn't bother t ow up. 
Is this really the same man who starred in The 
Good, the Bad and the Ugly? 
Great Balls of Fire! -Probably the most 
significant failure of the summer, Fire was an 
artistic and commercial bo b. Mini-major Orion 
can ill-afford the bath it took on this movie.
