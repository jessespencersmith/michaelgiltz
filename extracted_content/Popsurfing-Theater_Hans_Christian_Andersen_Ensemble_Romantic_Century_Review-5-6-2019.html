THEATER: HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S
LIFE WAS NO FAIRY TALE
HANS  CHRISTIAN  ANDERSEN:  TALES  REAL  AND
IMAGINED  * 1/2 out of ****
THE  DUKE  ON  42ND  STREET  
Proving how rich and varied the theater world is in New York City, theEnsemble for the Romantic Century is celebrating its 18th season (stillhigh off the critical acclaim for their show Van  Gogh's  Ear)  and yet
somehow I've never seen any of their 40 or so productions. Thecompany is known for creating atypical bio-plays that combine liveclassical music with the story of historical figures such as EmilyDickinson, Arturo Toscanini and the painter Vincent Van Gogh. In thecase of the Danish writer most famous for fairy tales like "The
Emperor's New Clothes," "The Snow Queen" and "Thumbelina,"
they're even incorporating puppetry.
Owning an insane amount of folk and fairy tales (not to mention
loving puppetry), I am perhaps the ideal adult audience member for
this show. Sadly, it's a noble failure of the sort one would expect of a
bio-play celebrating an historical figure. The odd twists and turns ofAndersen's celibate life, the fine performances of pieces by Britten andPurcell among others and the sheer commitment of all involved makethis a noble failure, but a failure nonetheless.
Written by Eve Wolf and directed by Donald T. Sanders, the show tells
of Andersen's life from start to finish, making every dutiful stop alongthe way. Born into poor circumstances, Andersen hightailed it toCopenhagen at the age of 14 and lucked into a spot at the Royal Danish
Theatre. That led to Hans impressing the head enough to land the lad
a thorough education, funded by King Frederick VI no less. And upand up he went; rubbing shoulders with the high and mighty; writingpieces of theater, poetry, travelogues and yes fairy tales, the storieswhich slowly but surely made him world famous.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: 'BLKS' IS</p>
<p>Andersen might share dinner with Charles Dickens but he never found
similar success in his private life. He shunned his mother and sister as
undesirably lower class, he yearned for acceptance from the
aristocratic family that semi-adopted this stray of a child but nevertook him to their breast and he chastely yearned for men and womenwho clearly did not reciprocate his affections. Gay? Straight?Bisexual? The one thing most biographers agree on is that Hans died a
virgin.
Frustrated sexual desire, social climbing, world fame eclipsed by
private shame -- Hans Christian Andersen was a complicated man.While the details of his life are revealed, the play never turns them
into dramatic fare. Most of his fairy tales are glancingly referenced,
with only "The Ugly Duckling" (as autobiographical as it gets for him)and "The Little Match Girl" incorporated more fully into the show.Hans obviously identified with the maligned creature who blossomedinto a swan. And the inexplicable climax of the play involves a silent
reenactment of that heart-tugging fairy tale about a beggar girl
freezing to death on New Year's Eve.
Bald statements about the life of Andersen are interrupted by so-so
puppetry or fine performances of classical pieces arranged for two
pianos and percussion along with a counter tenor. Arvo Pärt seems theodd duck here, alongside a program dominated by Purcell, Britten andone apiece by Igor Stravinsky and Samuel Barber. Still, that deeplyreligious Estonian composer is a personal favorite and a pleasure to
hear. Nonetheless, I struggled to make any connection between the
music and the story of Andersen's life, turning them into welcome butpuzzling respites from the dramatics.
A better show would have the fairy tales revealing the soul of this sad
writer more effectively with the music underscoring the action with
purpose, rather than the randomness in selection I felt here. While thepuppetry is by and large forgettable, the musical performances aresolid. And the acting by leads Jimmy Ray Bennett and RandallScotting (who also doubled as the singer at the performance I saw)
were solid. Bennett showed Andersen's insecure name-dropping and
craving for acceptance without making him too pathetic, no small task.SERIOUSLY FUNNY

<p>Scotting (in multiple roles but especially the object of affection
Edvard) was just as assured.
Yet even the ending is bungled, with a perfectly fine last image
returning us to where the show began trampled on by an unnecessary
coda declaring that the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen wouldlive forever. Yes, we know. A better show would make that pointwithout having to announce it so baldly.
