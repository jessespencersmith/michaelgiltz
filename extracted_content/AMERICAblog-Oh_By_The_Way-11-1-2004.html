11/01/2004 01:12:00 AMTucked away on page 12 of the New York Times was a quiet little APstory telling us that ANOTHER SITE WITH U.N.-SEALED ARMS WASLOOTED!!! My God, this should have been on the front page of thepaper. What drives me nuts about the story of the tons of explosivesbeing taken from one site is the implication that it's the only onewhen there are COUNTLESS stories of screw-ups. The hundreds oftons from the one site, the nuclear technology looted over days (orweeks or months) from another site that we found about two weeksago and now this."In a lengthy Oct. 6 report summarizing a fruitless search for bannedweapons in Iraq, the inspectors known as the Iraq Survey Groupdisclosed that widespread looting occurred at Muthanna afterthe fall of the Iraqi capital in April 2003."An annex of the 985-page report said every United Nations-sealedlocation at the desert installation had been breached in the lootingspree, and "materials and equipment were removed.""Bunker 2 at Muthanna State Establishment, once Iraq's centralchemical weapons production site, was put under the control of theUnited Nations in early 1991 after it was damaged by an Americanbomb in the Persian Gulf war. At the time, Iraq said 2,500 sarin-filledartillery rockets had been stored there."Oops.
