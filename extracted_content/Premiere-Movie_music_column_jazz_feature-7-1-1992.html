            <p>JAZZ. WHEN MOST PEOPLE 
hear it, they picture lonely 
streets, ill-fated lovers, 
and smoke-filled bars. But 
when moviemakers hear 
jazz, they picture something far 
more unusual: talking typewrit­
ers, quiet little boys, and rebel­
lious Albanians. For the adven­
turous soundtrack CD 
collector, that's good news. 
• Take Naked Lunch (Mi­
lan/BMG), David Cronenberg's 
movie about disemboweled 
characters and articulate ori­
fices-jazz seems ideally suited 
to capturing its twisted beauty. 
The film's score is a piercing, in­
tense work by Howard. Shore 
and Ornette Coleman. Not for 
the fainthearted. 
• Jazz is less obvious a 
choice for Little Man 
Tate (Varese Sarabande), 
the story of a melancholic 
boy blessed, or perhaps sad­
dled, with genius. But Mark 
Isham's modest compositions ----­HEAR HERE 
SCORING -----reflect the sheer joy of creativity 
that hides behind Fred Tate's re­
served demeanor. 
• For Blow-Up (Sony), jazz 
was the clear pick. Back in 
1966, director Michelangelo 
Antonioni needed up-to-the­
minute credibility for his fash­
ion-world milieu, and Herbie 
Hancock's jazz-fusion score de­
livers, cheekily quoting every­
thing from blues to rock to 
Henry Mancini. 
• Tune in Tomorrow ... (Columbia) may be an uneasy 
mix of Albanian activists and 
soap-opera satire, but Wynton 
Marsalis and his jazz combo-at 
the top of their form-capture 
the charm and humor of New 
Orleans with buoyant ease. 
• In Spike Lee's Do the Right 
Thing (Columbia), the subtle 
give-and-take between tradition­
al film styles and in-your-face in­
novations is mirrored in dad Bill 
Lee's score. Musical ideas are 
raised in jazz settings, seemingly 
resolved by the traditional sweep 
of a string-heavy orchestra, then 
rephrased and raised again. 
• Also check out what Miles 
Davis and Marcus Miller did for 
Siesta (Warner Bros.); Herbie 
Hancock's all-star lineup on 
Round Midnight (Columbia); 
and-if you can fmd it-the leg­
endary Duke Ellington 
score for Anatomy of 
a Murder (last re­
leased by Rykodisc).
