7/07/2005 04:35:00 PMSure, they've raised the color alert from yellow to orange. But Iam still angry about Bush's weakness as a commander in chiefand his failure to make our borders more secure. And to thosewho suggest I'm trying to score political points: wrong. I'mtrying to make America safer.A thousand different issues are contained in making ourcountry safer and it wouldn't be surprising if something fellthrough the cracks. But our ports have been front and centeras a vital and vulnerable area of our borders. Our coastlinesand shipping have been front and center too.And the Coast Guard issue didn't fall through the cracks. Bushfocused in on it. He looked at an aging fleet among the oldestin the world, one around when we were still in Vietnam. He sawplans developed three years BEFORE 9-11 to upgrade theCoast Guard in 20 years at about $20 billion. With the war onterror at full blast, with the 9-11 Commission highlighting thevulnerability of the ports (one of the Coast Guard's duties),with Republican Senator Olympia Snowe calling for the plan tobe accomplished in 10-15 years, what did Bush do? He decidedto DELAY the upgrading of our Coast Guard until 2030 to savea few bucks. That means a child born today will graduate fromCOLLEGE before Bush has gotten around to fully upgrading ourCoast Guard.A real Commander in Chief would look at the Coast Guard inthe light of 9-11 and say $20 billion to upgrade it in 20 years?How fast can we upgrade it? How much to do everything in twoyears? $30 billion? $40 billion? Do it.Would any American question that expenditure or think it apoor decision? Of course not. Bush's failure to make ourcountry safer is a sign of weakness and incompetence.It's been 4 years since 9-11 and we STILL don't have acombined list of terrorists that can be checked against peoplecoming into our country by plane, car or boat. It was crazy wedidn't have this before 9-11. It's criminal that we don't have itnow.It's been 4 years and Bush has failed to strengthen securityaround our highly vulnerable chemical and nuclear energyplants. Why? Because big business doesn't want to pay forincreased security and Bush is putting their concerns ahead ofthe safety of America.It's been 4 years and Bush is delaying the strengthening ofour coastlines and ports to two and a half DECADES. Anyreasonable person would speed up the strengthening of ourcoastlines and ports. Why isn't Bush?It's been 4 years and Bush has failed to hunt down and killOsama Bin Laden.It's been 4 years and Bush can't even ferret out a felon in theWhite House.
