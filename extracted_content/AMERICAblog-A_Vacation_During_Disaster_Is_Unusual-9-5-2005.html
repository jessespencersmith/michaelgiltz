9/05/2005 01:00:00 PMSays the New York Times (without irony):The crisis put enormous pressure on many police officersand firefighters, pressure some could not withstand. P.Edwin Compass III, the New Orleans police superintendent,said on Saturday that 200 of the 1,500 members of hisforce had walked off the job and that two others hadcommitted suicide. He said on Sunday that the city hadoffered to send all members of the police and firedepartments and their families on vacations to Las Vegas.The notion of a vacation in the midst of disasterstruck some as unusual. But officials likened it to an R&Rbreak for combat troops.The notion of a vacation in the midst of disaster struck some asunusual? How does the notion of a President and Vice President andother top aides STAYING ON VACATION from the very beginningstrike them?Someone please write to the New York Times atletters@nytimes.com and point out the grotesque irony of it.People are criticizing the first responders who are collapsing afterworking day and night for a week and no one is criticizing Bush forstaying on vacation during the worst natural disaster in our nation'shistory.
