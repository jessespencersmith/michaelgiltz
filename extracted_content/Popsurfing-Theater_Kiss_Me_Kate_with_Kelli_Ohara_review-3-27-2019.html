THEATER: "Kate, Do I Have Your Consent To Ask
For A Kiss?"
KISS  ME,  KATE!  *** out of ****
ROUNDABOUT  THEATRE  AT  STUDIO  54
Such fuss! Would the prim and proper Kelli O'Hara be capable of
rolling around in the mud of a broad comedy? Would audiences beshocked by a 70 year old musical and -- can you imagine -- dated ideasof a battle between the sexes? Well, Kelli O'Hara can do anything
(duh!) and classic shows offer more than their outmoded stereotypes
or no one would continue to perform them.
So rest easy. Kiss  Me,  Kate!  is what it's always been and that's old-
fashioned fun with a terrific Cole Porter score, more good dancing
than any other show on Broadway and a sweet romance at its heartthat makes this silly comedy just a tad more heartfelt. Don't worry. Noone is going to confuse this light musical with a kitchen sink drama.But the 2019 Kiss  Me,  Kate!  has just enough genuine emotion to make
it distinctive from the fondly remembered cartoonish version of 1999.To my mind, this one is less slapstick, more human and better.
The ground-breaking Oklahoma  clearly raised everyone's game. Irving
Berlin sucked it up and delivered Annie  Get  Your  Gun,  a show almost
absurdly stuffed with standards. Cole Porter did the same with   Kiss
Me,  Kate! , his valentine to a life in the theater and the last great work
he ever did. ( Can-Can  and Silk  Stockings  are fine, but hardly great.)
In it, movie star Lilli Vanessi (Kelli O'Hara) returns to the theater to
star in a new musical version of Shakespeare's 
The  Taming  Of  The
Shrew  opposite her ex-husband Fred Graham (Will Chase). She's
being wooed by a military man and future Presidential candidate who
believes Lilli would make a great First Lady. Fred naturally thinks sheMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>should be the first lady of the theater. Washington? What a bore! They
fight, they bicker, some gangsters show up to muscle Fred into paying
a debt and end up on stage in bit parts, a hoofer (Corbin Bleu in
another charming, breakout of a performance) falls in love with an
actress (Stephanie Styles), some spanking does NOT take place (atleast not when we're watching) and the show goes delightfully on.
It's all innocent fun. O'Hara does indeed radiate a natural dignity,which she used so well in The  King  and  I.  Here she raises it just a
notch to imperious, making her descent into a free-for-all with Fred allthe more enjoyable. In contrast, Will Chase can't deploy the out-there
comedy chops he used in Something  Rotten,  making his Fred slightly
more anonymous. True, there's no tension in wondering if Fred wants
Lilli back because she's good box office or because he loves her, butthat also means the core of the show is more intimate and sweet.
So the woman wins in the title card bout. But in the under card, we
find the man on top. That's the simmering romance between hooferBill Calhoun (Bleu) and the actress with the wandering eye Lois Lane(Styles). Styles is making her Broadway debut and she mines the mostout of her comic scenes. However, the generally terrific jazzy
orchestrations of Larry Hochman throw Styles off her game on the big
number "Always True To You In My Fashion." The syncopation of thesong as presented here just doesn't let Styles land her jokes and thatturns what should be a show-stopper into something less.
Bleu however is a winner from start to finish. With a nothing role, he
adds charm and charisma to spare, making Bill someone you know youcare about from the very start.   A triple threat, Bleu gets two big
showcases. Late in the show he performs "Bianca," a nothing song that
serves as an excuse for some great dancing. He's so infectious you
don't even blink when Bill is suddenly dancing on the ceiling. (Still,director Scott Ellis might have allowed Lois to come out from herdressing room sooner so she could overhear Bill singing her praisesrather than just watching him dance.)►  April (10)

<p>And then there's the act two opener "Too Darn Hot." Like many great
dance numbers, it builds and builds, with the choreography of Warren
Carlyle topping itself effortlessly. Unlike some other big numbers, thisone never feels like it's trying to show off. It happens so organically, soinfectiously you never feel bludgeoned into appreciation. It's a genuine
show-stopper and thank god -- those dancers need a long chance to
rest and   the applause gives it to them.
Worth the price of admission? Absolutely, but then so is O'Hara who
radiates sexiness and charm and the sheer love of being onstage from
start to the inevitable finish with the reprise of "Another Op'ning,Another Show." The sets by David Rockwell are spot-on for a 1950stouring show. True, the more human scale ups the emotional contentand lowers the spoofy comedy. If you felt The  Producers  was a tad
restrained, this is not the Kiss  Me,  Kate!  for you. (Indeed, the
gangsters -- usually an audience favorite -- fall utterly flat, anothercasualty since cartoons just don't make sense in this newly conceivedworld.) But who cares when you've got a torrent of great songs like"Wunderbar," "So In Love" and "Too Darn Hot," a foolproof book that
clearly inspired Michael Frayn's Noises  Off  and a star like O'Hara? It's
no pie in the face like the '99 version but it fully deserves that
exclamation point.
