            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 0 ,  2 0 0 6Why Are The Olympics A RatingsDisappointment?USA Today and many others have numerous explanations for why theOlympics are doing only modestly in the ratings. But here's my take.First, of course, the Olympics are boosting the ratings for every cablechannel -- like USA and MSNBC -- that is carrying them. Plus, NBC'swebsite is exploding with people checking out scores, downloadingvideos, etc. The Olympics is a huge source of material and the betterNBC gets at exploiting that material in every possible platform, themore money they'll make. And yes, USA Today is right that the Games-- especially the Winter Games -- are bloated. The Olympics hasdesperately added a bunch of Gen X sports -- not because they want toreach kids particularly, but because they want to have as many days ofTV as possible and the Winter Games traditionally had far fewer eventsthan the summer games. But the single biggest reason isn't mentioned:the disastrous decision to alternate the Games every two years. Thatturned the Olympics from a once-every-four-years special event a laWorld Cup -- into the event that never seems to go away. American Idolwisely only does one show a year. The Olympics would be smart to suckit up and go back to the every four years format as soon as possible.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
