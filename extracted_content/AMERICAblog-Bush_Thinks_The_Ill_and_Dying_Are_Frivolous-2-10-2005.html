2/10/2005 02:17:00 PMIn his State of the Union speech, Bush said, "Justice is distorted, andour economy is held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous asbestosclaims -- and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year."I guess he was referring to problems like this:"W.R. Grace and Co. and seven high-ranking employees knew aMontana mine was releasing cancer-causing asbestos into theair and tried to hide the danger to workers and townspeople,according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday. More than1,200 people became ill, and some of them died, prosecutorssaid," according to USA Today.Why doesn't the press ask Bush about this alleged crime andexplain why he thinks the more than one thousand sick or deadMontanans are "frivolous'?
