 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: Take Me Out to the Ballgame,
Please!
Baseball is winding up its regular season and as a Yankee fan I prepare myself -- as I do every year -- for
October baseball. How obnoxious of Yankee fans, cursed since the 1920s for their inevitable successduring the Fall Classic. For most teams, the season is over (or will be over in a day or two) and they'lleither bite their tongue and watch other, better teams compete for the World Series or they'll drown theirsorrows. Increasingly, they can drown their sorrows by plunging into elaborate boxed sets that celebrateteams and even stadiums. Here are some of the best baseball DVDs, followed by other titles out recently.

GAMES OF THE XXX OLYMPIAD: LONDON 2012  ($39.93 BluRay; NBC) -- Sports on DVD has
proven a boon, making classic games that just moldered in libraries available to fans like never before.Everyone benefits. But thanks to DVD's capacity and the endless amount of material available, it's hard tosatisfy hardcore fans. But the bigger and more elaborate a set, the higher standards I have to apply.Diehard Mets fans will surely want to own the 10 DVD Mets set, which like the Boston set is beautifullypackaged with a nice hardcover book. You get 24 hours of content but so much is missing that fans willsurely moan even as they shell out. Only one game from the 1969 World Series? (That whole series willsurely come out someday but why not here?) You do get an all-new 50 greatest Mets (which is availableseparately); it's so comprehensive you won't argue about who was left out but who shouldn't have been
included. The Boston set is also frustrating, despite 12 DVDs. You get a new documentary about Fenway,
tons of extensive highlight films and six complete games. But in this case they're duplicating games
already available on other sets, meaning the faithful have to plunk down money for the same games to get
the new stuff. As with TV shows, the biggest sets should come first and then smaller sets, so no one feels
ripped off if they've been buying releases all along. For newcomers, it'll be a satisfying purchase, though
as a Yankee fan I refuse to recommend it on principle. The Milwaukee Brewers have a far less storiedhistory and since the Essentials collection is a more modest set with four complete games, there's a lotless to nitpick. Fans will be happy to get it and ask for more. All baseball fans should enjoy BaseballPelotero , a documentary narrated by John Leguizamo. It's like the recent film Sugar  come to life and
though it's only 77 minutes, the story of teenagers in the Dominican Republic hoping to get signed to acontract with MLB is naturally compared to Hoop Dreams.  It's presented by manager Bobby Valentine
and obviously he now has plenty of time to promote it. Finally, one more example of sports releases donepoorly: the recent London Olympics. Fans complained that the Opening and Closing ceremonies are notincluded in full but doubtless that's due to the wildly complicated music rights issues that crop up whenyou include songs from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and countless other iconic UK bands. Nonetheless,a two-disc set that does nothing but skim highlights for several hours (and one full match: women'sbeach volleyball gold medal round) feels very incomplete given the mass of material available. MaybeNBC doesn't have the right to or time to craft documentaries about individual events and includeMOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2

<p>complete coverage of key races but that doesn't change the fact that this set feels rushed and incomplete
to fans who spent days in front of their TV sets.
PINK RIBBONS INC.  ($27.95 DVD; First Run Features)
SURVIVING PROGRESS  ($27.95 DVD; First Run Features) -- Baseball Pelotero  isn't the only strong
documentary out recently. Pink Ribbons Inc.  takes a seemingly innocuous, even admirable act -- donning
a pink ribbon to support breast cancer research and support for those fighting it -- and reveals a
surprisingly complex ethical issue and how a noble cause can become sidetracked or misguided bycorporate involvement and the simple desire to maintain and grow the advocacy group itself rather thanfocus on the threat of cancer. On the flip side, Surviving Progress takes seemingly esoteric philosophicaldiscussions about the idea of progress and how it's manifested in economics, consumption, technologyand the environment and makes the debate illuminating and exciting. Together, they're two more
reasons why we're in a golden age for documentaries.

<p>THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS COMPLETE SERIES  ($79.95 DVD; Scholastic/NewVideo)
JOSEPH CAMPBELL MYTHOS COMPLETE SERIES  ($99.99 DVD; Athena) -- Two quite different
releases, but both are complete sets of popular TV shows. One for the adults and one for kiddies and if
you have to ask which is which, you've got some smart kids. The Emmy Award-winning Magic School Busshamelessly combines mildly adventurous tales fine for small tykes with introductions to variousscientific and historical facts and concepts. Clearly in the tradition of PBS with more sophisticated ideasto tackle beyond letters and numbers and getting along. You get 54 episodes in all and it's at a welcomelow price compared to previous smaller sets that cost $10 or more for just three episodes. ThinkerJoseph Campbell went on a lecture tour late in life and this set contains all 15 episodes or lectures,dealing as always with mythic stories and how they resonate around the globe. It's hosted and narratedby Susan Sarandon, but mostly it's Campbell himself delivering a fascinating but definitely scholarly talkon the issues that consumed him throughout his career. Beginners should start with Campbell's chatswith Bill Moyers, who helps to ground the discussion and provide an entry way into his ideas. But forCampbell fans, this is essential stuff.</p>
<p>PRODUCED BY GEORGE MARTIN  ($19.98 BluRay; Eagle Rock)
THE ART OF RAP  ($19.97 DVD; Indomina)
PAUL SIMON LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY  ($14.99 CD/DVD; Hear Music/Concord)
JUST AROUND THE CORNER  ($19.99 DVD; Virgil) -- It's not often you get to discover a new look at
the Beatles that proves genuinely illuminating, but that's what you get with Produced By George Martin.
A BBC TV documentary with almost an hour of bonus footage, it charts Martin's entire career (beginningwith comedy legends the Goon Squad and others) before of course moving on to the Beatles, America,solo albums and more. Martin is a good interview and while fanatics have heard most of what's here, theperspective of Martin makes it fresh. Ice-T does a fine job of capturing the art of rap in his new film. He's
fighting a battle already one when establishing that rap is a viable art form but his access and bluntness
make this fun for fans and neophytes. Paul Simon is clearly on the downward slope when it comes to live
performances, even though he can still turn out a great song and even darn good albums. This intimate
Webster Hall performance is an ideal showcase for his late career musings, re-appraisals of classic tunes
and those eccentric hand gestures he employs throughout. The DVD is not as frantically edited as mostconcert films these days and the two audio discs offer the entire night with Simon in good voice. Peopledealing with Parkinson's Disease personally or with their loved ones will be the first to glom onto thisdocumentary. But any rockers intrigued by the inclusion of music by Bruce Springsteen and others willhear the story of a guy who took bad news and turned it into a battle to fight disease that has given hislife new meaning and spawned a string of benefit concerts over the years.</p>

Some Thoughts
On...Weird Noir packs together six rather minor flicks with no name casts (you can spot a young Steve
McQueen in Girl On The Run  if you don't blink) and slaps on some great cover art to make it all far more
appealing than it has the right to be. I haven't yet discovered an unheralded gem amongst The NakedRoad  (as opposed to fully clothed roads?), The Seventh Commandment, Stark Fear  and the rest. But you
never know... Four classic films are released on BluRay by Olive, which cherry picks catalog titles from
Paramountand gets them out in modest sets that are usually not remastered and with few if any extras.
Still, if you don't own the titles at all, these are certainly comparable to prior DVD releases, albeit not
often superior the way BluRay can be and these titles deserve. I'm looking forward to the Broadway
revival and greatly enjoyed the Gerard Depardieu version so I'm long overdue for watching the Jose
Ferrer classic rendition of Cyrano . Everything by Orson Welles deserves lavish remastering and his low-
budget fare like Macbeth  desperately need it. But this is Welles and therefore essential. Ronald Coleman
deservedly won an Oscar for A Double Life , the clever theatrical tale of a stage actor going a little too
deep into character while playing Othello. The Raoul Walsh western Pursued  has some dated psychology,
but it's not nearly as dated as say Hitchcock's Spellbound  and the combination of noir and western (not
to mention Robert Mitchum and Teresa Wright) make this more than curio.
