NOone has ever suc­
cessfully pulled a 
practical joke on 
actor William Shatner. 
"I'm too egotistical to 
think I would fall for any­
thing like that> says Shat­
\~r, whose sense of 
humor has kept him afloat 
in Hollywood for 40 
years. 
"So it hasn't been done. 
But I'm a con man and 
you know what they say 
about con men. They can 
be conned more easily 
than anyone. 
''I'm preparing myself 
for that. terrible moment 
when something is pulled 
on me." 
It'll have to wait. Shat­
ner is the one pulling the 
strings when he plays a 
doozey of a prank on Riv­
erside, Iowa, the self-pro­
claimed, future birth 
place of Captain James T. 
Kirk of "Star Trek." 
Next Tuesday, he 
launches a reality minise­
ries called "Invasion: 
Iowa" for Spike TV. 
Over four nights -end­
ing April Fool's Day -we 
see Shatner and crew 
come to town pretending 
to shoot a low-budget sci­
fi movie. But really they 
spend their time pushing 
the locals' buttons. 
Think of it as "Candid 
Camera" with (really 
bad) special effects. 
Shatner is the self-ab­
sorbed star -grabbing 
food off people's plates in 
the local diner (no one ever complains), walking 
around with his Emmy in 
hand, playing with the 
bust of Captain Kirk in the 
town square and asking 
the local minister if he 
minds if the movie people 
smash the lOO-year-old 
stained glass windows in 
the church. 
Locals are recruited to 
act in the film and serve 
as go-fers, card holders 
and so on. 
His cell phone goes 
off, blasting out -
of all things -
Usher's hit single 
"Caught Up" as the 
ring tone. 
That gives them a front­
row seat to watch as Shat­
ner's body double spends 
ages stretching before his 
nude scenes or to over­
hear that Shatner's hap­
less personal assistant is 
"actually" his illegitimate 
son -but doesn't know 
it. 
Still, no matter how 
goofy he acts, it's clear the 
townspeople -who bake 
the crew pies and put up 
with their idiocy with 
good-nature -are really 
thrilled about the movie. 
When one local who 
wants to be a stand-up 
comic speaks movingly 
about how much this 
means to him, Shatner 
and the rest start to look 
very uneasy about the 
joke they're playing. (The 
townspeople find out the 
truth during the finale.) "It occurred certainly to 
me and to all of us that 
what we were about to do 
could be very cruel," says 
Shatner. "But if we played 
the joke on ourselves so 
that we appeared the fool 
and they reacted to our 
foolishness and Holly­
wood behavior, then it 
worked." 
His cell phone goes off 
during the interview, 
blasting out -of all 
things -Usher's hit sin­
gle "Caught Up" as the 
ring tone. "I need a loud 
ring," explains Shatner. 
"Somehow my upper reg­
ister is leaving me so I 
gotta get a lot of volume." 
It's a reminder that 
Shatner -who turns 74 
tomorrow -has never 
been hipper. 
His new movie, "Miss 
Congeniality 2," opens on 
Friday. 
And of course, he's rev­
elling in his "Boston 
Legal" role -Denny 
Crane. The show has en­
joyed a constant stream of 
guest stars. 
"Heather Locklear is in 
my arms -not as we 
speak, but shortly after 1 
put the phone down," 
says Shatner about his 
"T.J. Hooker" co-star 
who will be two upcom­
ing episodes in May. That 
has to be more fun than 
another recent guest, Carl 
Reiner, right? 
"I put him in my arms, 
too," says Shatner. "I have 
no discernment what­
soever."</p>
