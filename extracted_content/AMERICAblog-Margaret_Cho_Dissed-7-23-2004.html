Margaret Cho Dissed
by Michael in New York  on 7/23/2004 04:08:00 PM
Margaret Cho has been dumped by the Human Rights Campaign
from performing at its Monday gala near the Democratic convention
in Boston, according to USA Today. We just praised HRC for their
recent smart political ads on the Cheneys. Too bad they caved here
out of fear the media would make hay over her comments. There's a
big difference between an HRC event with a stand-up comic (one of
our favorites) making jokes and an event where candidate Kerry is in
attendance, sharing a stage with celebs and calls them the "heart
and soul" of the nation. Maybe Rush Limbaugh would have tried tomake something out of it, but no one else would. HRC's sillydefense? "We didn't want to censor her, so we're making other
plans." You didn't want to censor her so you censored her? Huh?
