            <p>DVDs: Denzel Takes Flight ; and The REALHouse of Cards!
Here's this week's roundup of top releases, including Oscar nominee Denzel Washington
(one of Hollywood's most bankable stars), Disney's beloved take on Peter  Pan,  the original
House  Of  Cards  and more. Enjoy.
FLIGHT  ($39.99 BluRay combo;
Paramount) -- Denzel Washington is oneof Hollywood's most dependable stars.Studios love him because his presencevirtually guarantees a solid opening forany movie he appears in. Critics love himbecause even on his more predictablevehicles, Washington is an intelligentactor who brings complexity and charm tothe script. Audiences love him becausethat's what they do. So he was a smartchoice to play the alcoholic pilot in theRobert Zemeckis drama Flight , a pilot
whose very recklessness in his personal
life may have been the key reason he was
able to instinctively save a passenger
airline from a truly disastrous crash with a nervy stunt literally no one else would havethought of, much less tired. Too bad he was drunk on the job and that the standard post-accident blood test will turn him from a hero to a villain in the media. Washingtontypically makes Whip Whitaker (what a name!) into a compelling character. But almost assoon as it begins the movie introduces cliched storylines and TV movie bromides thatsoften the story. For a brief exciting moment, it seems possible the movie might surpriseus with a cynical spin. It's only because Washington is at the helm that we enjoy this
possibility. But the movie chickens out and turns to mush before our eyes. The crash itself
is effective, though I still give "scariest crash" to the Jeff Bridges drama Fearless .
HOUSE  OF  CARDS  UK  ($39.98 DVD;
BBC/Warner Bros.) -- Maybe you don'tsubscribe to Netflix. Or maybe you'vealready watched the Kevin Spaceyminiseries House  Of  Cards.  Do yourself a
favor and dive into the original, whichhas a defining, droll performance by IanRichardson as the master politicalmanipulator Francis Urquhart. Theyswapped accents (British for Southern)
but the stories are essentially the same in
the first season, down to some sillinesswith the media that doesn't quite ringtrue. Besides, you can watch all threeminiseries in this set, figure out where theUS version is headed and seem smarter
than all your friends. Jut the sort of thing Urquhart would do.
PETER  PAN  DIAMOND  EDITIONMay 1, 2014

Posted: 02/07/2013 6:02 pm</p>
<p>($44.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- I know
it began as a play but the novel by J.M.Barrie is the artistic peak of this uniquestory. (Truly, the novel is surprisinglywitty and will break your heart.) I've seensome tremendous theatrical productionsbut there's never been a good film versionand that includes this beloved Disney
movie. The animation is neither
distinctive in style nor detailed, the storyis plodding and the songs are mostlygrating, with "Following The Leader"especially banal. ("Second Star To TheRight" is ok but has an ungainly melody;"Never Smile At A Crocodile" is the pick
of a weak litter.) Among the voice actors, Kathryn Beaumont is a stand-out as Wendy,capturing well the sparkling personality of a girl becoming a young woman. Still,animation is key and it falls far short here. However, it's part of the Disney canon andthere's no question that they present the film beautifully here. The remastering is pristineand the extras are kid-friendly, though film buffs might have appreciated a commentarytrack from animators or historians.
SOUTHLAND  COMPLETE  SEASONS
2,  3,  AND  4  ($59.98 DVD; Warner
Bros.) -- Here is positive synergy in
action. NBC canceled this fine cop dramatoo soon, despite great reviews. But thisWarner Bros. studio series was picked upby its own cable channel TNT, whichbroadcast season one and the sixcompleted episodes of season two topretty good ratings. They eventually made
the numbers work (mainly by shrinking
the cast) and went ahead with 10episodes each for seasons three and four.In other words, it's been almost asarduous keeping Southland  on the air as
a day on the job for an LA cop. (Though
when you're on set only curses fly and no one's life is in danger.) The very good BenjaminMcKenzie of The  OC  is the heart of the show, a rookie cop with something to prove. But
it's become a genuine ensemble, a good thing when you've got Regina King on hand. Sinceseason two was only sporadically available, consider its inclusion here a bonus feature forthose late to the game rather than punishment to those who have been supporting theshow all along. Start your binge viewing now: season five begins February 13!
A  LATE  QUARTET  ($29.99 BluRay;
FOX)THE  POOL  ($29.95 DVD; Kino Lorber)
LITTLE  WHITE  LIES  ($29.98 BluRay;
MPI)ALEX  CROSS  ($39.99 BluRay; Summit)
MADEA  GETS  A  JOB:  THE  PLAY($24.99 BluRay; Lionsgate) -- Strongactors can't rescue a trite story of friendsgrowing older and apart in A LateQuarter. Still, when you have PhilipSeymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener and
Christopher Walken on tap, the cliches</p>
<p>promise to go down as easily as the
beautifully performed classic music.
Documentary filmmaker Chris Smith
capitalized on his success with American
Movie  to make The  Pool , a passion
project about a pool boy in India. It maynot have broken out commercially, but itproved Smith has genuine talent and anindependent spirit.
Little  White  Lies  is the exact opposite: it's
a flasy French drama with an all-star cast
enlivening the Big  Chill -like story of
friends gathering together for a weekendwhere old wounds will open, secrets willbe revealed and little white lies will beexposed. Thank goodness MarionCotillard, Jean Dujardin and Francois
Cluzet are on hand.
Tyler Perry did not succeed in stepping
into the shoes of Morgan Freeman for areboot of Alex  Cross.  If the mere sight of
him toting a gun makes you giggle, it'sprobably because you're more used to seehim as Madea, whether it's on stage (theDVD release Madea  Gets  A  Job  captures
him performing live) or more likely at the
movies. Still, he's slowly expanded his
dramatic roles and Alex  Cross  won't be
the last time he ventures into newterritory.
SIDE  BY  SIDE  ($29.95 BluRay; New
Video)
DIANA  VREELAND:  THE  EYE  HASTO  TRAVEL  ($24.98 DVD: EOne)
PAUL  WILLIAMS:  STILLALIVE ($19.99 DVD; Virgil Films) --
Three pretty good documentaries, each
one strong enough on their own if you're
interested in the topic.
Keanu Reeves is not an ideal narrator for
Side  By  Side ; his voice-overs are pure Bill
&  Ted  even after all these years. But he</p>
<p>introduces the general public to the
interesting transition taking place inmovies from film to digital. The moviehas a wide scope, taking into account thedramatic shifts in editing once thatswitched to digital. While 3-D may be afad, once digital filmmaking is equal toshooting on stock it will unquestionably
be the dominant format for making a
film, just as it already dominates specialeffects, editing and distribution. Somedirectors will still choose film just assome movies are made in black andwhite. But digital will soon be king and atmost stages already is. This filmdemonstrates the pluses and minuses ofthis inevitable shift.
Diana Vreeland is an icon with a zest for
life so anyone with a yen for fashion willenjoy her company.
Paul Williams has had a surprisingly
quixotic and interesting career, as StillAlive  demonstrates. it's a pity the
filmmaker let Williams take over themovie and make their fandom a part ofthe story or this documentary would have
been even stronger. Williams is
interesting. A fan's appreciation? Not somuch.
ANIMANIACS  VOLUME  4  ($29.99
DVD; Warner Bros.) -- Cartoons for kids
get no respect, at least not right away.That may seem strange to say in an erawhere South  Park  and The  Simpsons  are
TV institutions and Pixar dominatesHollywood. But like Looney Tunes back inthe day, shorts that are geared ostensiblytowards kids are dismissed. Animaniacs
has the anarchic DNA of Warner Bros.
cartoons at its core and this final volumeof the TV series is the capper in a nutty,amusing, raucous show that will age verywell. In 20 years, they'll be calling thebest of these genuine classics.</p>
