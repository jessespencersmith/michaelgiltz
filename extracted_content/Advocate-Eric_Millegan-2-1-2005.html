(}ut talent Eric Millegan tells all about playing Harold in a new
musical version of the'70s cult classic film By Michael Giltz
arold, and Maude-the cult
classic 1971 film staxring 70-
something Ruth Gordon and
2Gsomething Bud Cort as un-
conventional lovers-is start-
ing to sing out. A new musical version
with book and llrics by Tom Jones (of
The Fantasticks fame) and music by
Joseph Thalken just opened at the
Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. It
mns through February 6, with Oscar-
winner Estelle Parsons (Bonni,e and
C\yde) as Maude and rising star Eric
Millegan as Harold.
Though the movie isnt gay, it has al-
ways spoken to gay viewers-including
Millegan, who remembers that when he
first rented it he did so because a new
friend (now his parffrer of seven years)
said that he'd be perfect as Harold if a
musical version were ever made. "It's
about'Be with the person youre in love
with.' It doesn't matter if she's 60 years
older than you or, if you're a gay man, if
it's a man," says Millegan. His favorite
song in the show, he adds, is "the last
song that Maude sings to Harold, called
'The Chance to Sing.'I ttdnk that will be
the favorite of a lot of people."
Millegan prepared for the role of anIntemet-surfing mash;rbator in the movie
On_Irine by ctntting up men in a "bear"
chat room-not to mention tearing off
his shirt and shoving his hand down his
pants for the audition. So you might
wony atrout his preparations for playing
the depressive-before-depressive-was-
cool tlarold.
"IVe played a lot of suicidal people,
actually,' says a laughing Millegan, who
was bom in New Jersey, raised in Ore-
gon, and now lives in Manhattan. "I was
suicidal n On_ILine. I did a workshop a
few years ago [in which] my character
actually shot himself in the head. I must
project something."
Unlike Harold, Millegan has nothing
to be sad about. He's appeared in a se.
ries of high-profile workshops lately, in-
cluding a new musical version of Mask
by BarryMann and CynthiaWeil; his Au-
gust birthday celebration performance
in a cabaret got efeat reviews; and being
out in the media hasn't slowed down his
career one bit. "One year [after coming
outl," says Millegan, "I have the best job
IVe ever had." I
