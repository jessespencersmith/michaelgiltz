Even Pat Buchanan Hates Bush
by Michael in New York  on 6/17/2004 05:31:00 PM
In the latest sign of eroding support for Bush, even right-wing nut
Pat Buchanan is furious at Dubya. In today's New York Post, it'sreported that Buchanan is getting $500,000 for a book called "Where
The Right Went Wrong?" that is nothing short of an anti-Bush tirade.
It goes on sale in August, right before the Republican convention,
which Buchanan will be covering for MSNBC. Maybe he'll go on tour
with Michael Moore? I'd go to THAT booksigning. This does call into
question, however, the old saying, "The enemy of my enemy is my
friend." In this case, he's still my enemy.
