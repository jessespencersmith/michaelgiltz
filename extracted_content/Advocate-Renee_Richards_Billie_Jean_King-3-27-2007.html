way of her upstate New York home. At 72, she's still
active arrd fit, though a far cry from the imposing ath-
lete who stalked the net at the 1977 U S Open, trvo
years aLter her sex-change operation
Richards became an unintentional hero when she was outed
afber an amateur tennis match in La Jolla, Calif. She was 41 years
otd and had no desire to turn pro. But when tennis officials pre-
emptively told her she couldn't, Richards began a fight that would
fbrever define her life
"I was happy starting a practice in ophthalmology in Oaliforrria,"she recals "Then they told me I coiildr't play, and ali of a sr-rCden I
became the world's actir.rst for the sexually diseniianchised "
Transgender people today may turn up in Oscar-nonrineted
frlms and smash-hit sitcoms, but in 1975 the very iclea of gender
reassigrrment was shocking The sex-change operation of Clrris-
tine Jorgensen had macle international headhnes tr'vo ciecades

"You have to put it in perspective," she says "Nobodv had
ever hearcl of doing an1'thing like this I was big l was tall I r'vas
not as strong as the 2O-year-old women I was pLaying' but I r'vas
imposing. I was a Pariah " P

Richards's newly released autobiogra-
plry, No Way Reruie: Tlrc Second Half of
My NotorioLrs lzle (Simon and Schuster)
revisits stories flom her best-selling 1983
memoir, Secorzd Serue She writes of grow-
ing up as Richard Raskin, a boy wearing
his sister's clothes, the years-long struggle
to have a sex-change operation, and the
decision to challenge the United States
Tennis Association for the risht to com-
pete agarnst women.
She then brings the story up-to-date,
sharing her bemused accommodation to
an ever-changing world, her career as an
ophthahnologist, her drive to be a good
father (Richards's word) to her son
Nicky, and the search for love that con-
tinues today.
It's a story Richards is proud to tell arid
retell. And while she's not shy about rec-
ognizing the path she forged, she is hardly
the firebrand activist sorne would wish a
transgender poster child to be.
"I'm not an advocate," she says, reflect-
ing on this publication's title. "I'm essen-
tially a pretty passive person-a tennis
player and a doctor "I'm not politica-lly or
socially what ordinary people would call
an activist."
Richards attributes much of her con-
ventional thinkirig to her upper-cr-ust edu-
cation at Horace Maln college prep schoolBillie Jean is lffng
The ultimate athlete was 32 years old and closeted
when transgendel" Rende Richards sued for the
right to play pro tennis against women. i{ere, she
looks back and contempiates the future of gays in
professional sports
It was an interesting time for all of us. I
cal remember trying to calm down all
the players. If somebody speaks up-it
doesn't have to be me all the time, but
any of us-its just amazing how every-
body calms down.
When you personally get to know
somebody, that changes everything. I
think that's what happened lwith
Ren6el. Some of the gu.ys knew her as
Richard. When sr.Le started playing,
the other women obviously started
talking to her and listening to her. All
of a sudden, they'd say, "Oh, my God,
she's so nice."
I think she should be so proud.
Every generation passes the baton to
the next. It had to be so horrible for
her. [But] you do have to live yourtruth; that's what Ren6e dicl. For
her, that meant an extremely diffi-
cult situation.
Both Martina and I were still clos-
eted [at the time]. Martina told me,
"I knew when I was born that I was
gay." I said, "What? You did?" I didn't
know at ail; I didn't have a clue. Mar-
tina and I were both going to be
outed. I was outed, but she was going
to be, and that's the reason she came
forward. She was not going to do it
lotherwise], believe me. It was really
rough times for us.
It's the gay gu.ys that have it even
rougher. We need quarterbacks of foot-
ball teams stepping up and saying,
"This guy's gay, suck it up, get over it."
I saw lformer NFL comrnissioner] Paul
Tagliabue at a Patriots game and he
said, "Guess what? My son's going to
be the head of Parents, Families, and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays " He was
so excited, so sweet. One person at a
time. Little steps Little shifts.
I was talking to Ilana [Kloss], my
partner, today. I said, "You know,
it's so much easier than it was even
10 years ago." Every year it gets eas-
ier. Maybe it's just that we're more
comfortable "This is your partner?
Fine, next," as opposed to kaspl.
It's amazing what Ren6e has done
for transgenders. What a symbol for
all of us, not just transgenders. Of
course, she doesn't even like that.
[Richards prefers the term trdnssex-
real.l She's stuck, but she knows it.
That's what makes it more funny.
Listen, when we go to dinner, I'll be
asking her, "What are you doing,
girl? You're the big momma. You've
got to help the next generation and
not make them feel like they'r'e
doing the wrong thing." -Billie
Jean King, from an itzteruieu with.

<p>in Riverdale, N.Y., and Ya]e in the 1950s,
where she learned the traditional values
that she adheres to today. For instance,
while Richards believes everyone deserves
the legal rights of marriage, she can't quite
force herself to think of two women as
"married."
"I was born in 1934. Marriage to me
rneant men and women," she admits. "I
have two very close friends three houses up
the road. They're lifetime partners and
they don't call themselves married-"
She quickly adds that they may be
bound by the same generational conven-
tions she learned. "They're in'their 50s. If
they were in their 20s, they'd be demand-
ing it. I}<now that," she says.
For her part, Richards thinks trans-
gender people should not be abie to com-
pete at the highest levels, a belief she re-
aiizes undermines everything she
accomplished. She suggests transgender
{emales like Canadian mountain biker
Michelle Dumaresq and Danish golfer Mi-
anne Bagger play at club events rather
than on national teams.
"The U S. Olynnpic Committee has de-
creed in all of its great glory and intelli-
genr:e that transsexuals can play in the
Olymplcs if two years have passed since
their operations-I think that's going to
come back to haurt them," she says.
It's not new thinking Tlansgender ath-
letes today confront many of the same ar-
guments Richards did 35 years ago What
constitutes gender? Are transgender people
fair competition in women's sports? Which
locher room do they use?
In the clanror Richards endured during
her battle to compete athletically against
women, she heard little complaint from the
one group you'd expect, her competition.
"I called her and said, 'Can I come listen
to you and your storw? At least meet you,"'
remembers Billie Jean King "She said
sure. I was there for fbur hours "
'1\4ren I look back on it, I'd say it was a
remarkably warrn welcome," Richards
says. "It's not just that they were willing to
play me; some of them have stayed close
friends to this day. Wendy Turnbull, Vir-
ginia Wade, Ilana Kloss, lVlartina LNawa-Do transgender athletes have an unfair advantage in competitive sports? You
tell us. Here's how Ren6e Richards and Martina Navratilova compared when
they were atlhe I977 U.S. Open.

King filed al affidavit in court support-
ing Richards's entry into the U.S Open. In
1981, Nawatilova asked Richards to ioin
her team of coaches as she prepared her
epic rivalry with Chris Evert. Nineteen
years later Nau"atilova would insist that
Richards induct her into the International
Tennis Hall of Fame.
"Here are the two greatest of all time in
my court," says Richards "Ald they had
everything to lose."
"Aft,er she won the lawsuit, the players
were freaking out," says King. "I said, You
gr-rys, she's a woman, so she's playing. Get
over it."'
Some of the details of Richards's life are
confounding, others surreal, and a few
seemingly self-sabotaging. When Richards
sought counsel for hel frght against the
USTA, she cbose closeted gay, homophobic,
McCarthyist lallyer Roy Cohn. \4rhen she
decided to begin her new life as a woman,four

she opted to live in Orange County, Califl,
which hasn't voted for a Democrat in a
presidential election since FDR's second
terrn. The ,John Wavne Tennis Club was
her local court.
In March 1999, Teruzis magazinc pub-
Iished an article titled "Regrets, She's Had
a Few," implving this included hcr sex-
reassigrment surgery. Although Richards
adamantly denies this is true, she admits
to r,vishing it had not been necessary
"I reelize it's rcmarkable," she says.
"lButl I wouid rather have not had this
ovelwlrelminglv diverse cxperient e oI
being able to live half of my iife as a marl
and half of mv life as a woman. I would
rather I rrrere not born or imprinted into
being il transsexuai Absolutely "
Richards acknowledges the ellect she's
had on transgender peopie and society at
large. But that doesn't mean she ap-
pi'oves of it
"I don't even like the word tr(Lnsgen-
ckred. I didn't have a gender operation: I
had a sex change. Now there's a new thing
that Lhe transgendered r,r,ant to har.e thej,.
birth certilicates changed so they can be
women without having an operation So it's
all my fault." I

Michael,i have been meaning to write to tell you how much I appreciated your sending me the article. I
think you did an excellent job,one of the best,of many,since the book came out. Well done!
However,you got me in trouble with my friends three houses away. Very calmly Lithgrowfyes,his name
is Lithgrow Osbome!] said to me at a recent party 'You know, renee ,chuck and I ARE married,and my
father who was an elderfor something] in the church,was there.' Oops! Shows what i know.
However,Billie jean and her partner Ilana Kloss are definitely not married,neither are martina and toni.
Is it different for men! who knows. You wrote a fine article! Best,renee
