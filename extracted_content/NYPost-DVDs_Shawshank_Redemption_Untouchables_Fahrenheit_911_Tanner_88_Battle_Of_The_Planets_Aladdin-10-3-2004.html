Fahrenheit 9/11 **'/2 Columbia TriStar, $28.95 
Michael Moore's scathing 
blockbuster may not change 
the election but it has certain­
ly changed movies by turning 
documentaries from a quiet 
little backwater into a com­
mercial force. And it might 
even be up for the Best 
Picture Oscar. It's not as good 
as "Bowling for Columbine," 
but "9/11" is well worth argu­
ing over. The many extras 
include White House press 
conferences and a featurette 
on life in Iraq before the inva­
sion. 
Tanner '88 
*** Criterion, $29.95 
Political junkies have more 
. than Michael Moore to feast 
on. Try tackling this landmark 
Robert Altman/Garry 
Trudeau HBO series, even 
though we've become so 
savvy it seems less remark­
able now. Also just out: 
"George W. Bush: Faith in the 
White House" (Good Times, 
$14.95); "Horns & Halos" (Go 
Kart Films, $24.98), a docu­
mentary about a controyersial 
Bush biography; and 
"Brothers in Arms" (FirSt 
Run, $19.95), a so-so film 
about Kerry's time in Vietnam 
that speaks with men who 
served alongside him. The 
Shawshank 
Redemption / 
The 
Untouchables **'/2 each 
Warner Bros. / 
Paramount; $26.99 / 
$19.99 
Two critical and 
commercial hits 
whose stock has dra­
matically changed. 
"The Shawshank 
Redemption" has 
fine performances, 
but for some reason, 
it has become 
absolutely beloved. 
"The Untouchables" 
scored an Oscar for 
Sean Connery, but it 
seems rather stodgy 
now. Both are new 
~_~ deluxe editions. 
Battle of the Planets 
25th Anniversary **'/2 Rhino, $24.95 
OK, this gets complicated. 
"Battle" is a memorable, 85-
episode Saturday morning car­
toon edited quite a bit from 
the Japanese original, 
"Gatchaman." Episodes 1-12 are 
on individual discs. Episodes 
13-24 are on the solid "Battle 
of the Planets Ultimate Set" 
(Rhino. $59.95), which includes 
the American and the 
Japanese version of each . 
episode. Unfortunately, thiS 
new set -episodes 25-38 -
doesn't include the superior 
Japanese versions of each 
show, making an already 
messy compilation rather dis­
appointing. 
Aladdin 
Special 
Edition ***'/2 Disney, $29.99 
Because it's an 
adventure film, 
1992's '~laddin" is rarely 
ranked alongside "Beauty and 
the Beast" or "The Lion King." 
But it should be, thanks to 
very good songs, a star turn by 
Robin Williams as the genie 
and a story that never flags. 
Extras include a virtual tour of 
the genie's lamp and a new 
song by Clay Aiken.</p>
