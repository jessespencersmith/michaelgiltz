THEATER: "HENRY V" CONQUERS ACCENTS,
NOT AUDIENCES
HENRY  V  * 1/2 out of ****
PUBLIC  THEATER
Shakespeare doesn't need any help. Knowing this, the Public Theater
has a Mobile Unit, a touring production company that brings theaterto the people that can't always come to it: elderly facilities, homelessshelters, schools, prisons and the like. They bring a square carpet, a
few modest props and a devoted cast. As everyone from Cheek By Jowl
to Joseph Papp have repeatedly demonstrated, theater-goers willeagerly bring the imagination. Instead of being a bare-bones hint atwhat theater can do, these spare productions can and should betheater at its inventive best.
But Shakespeare does need you to support the play. That rarely
happens here. Henry  V  like most (all?) of Shakespeare is filled with
enough wit, pathos, insight and contradictions to allow endlessinterpretations. But once an interpretation is chosen, every element,
every performance should support that idea. You'd be hard-pressed
here to know what they had in mind. And if it was to present the storyas simply and powerfully as possible, they failed.
Henry V is of course the feckless Prince Hal of Henry  IV,  now ready to
prove his lion-like nature and fitness to rule. His advisers urge war on
France and an insult by the Dauphin (tennis balls! the nerve!) isenough to rouse his warrior's blood. Henry sets off to war, uncovers anassassination plot, wins his first major victory, faces daunting odds atAgincourt but proves victorious again and soon wins all of France and
the hand of Princess Katherine in the bargain. While you can turn the
play on its head and reveal a deep distrust of our eagerness to justifywar, it's just as often used to boost morale. Here, I fear, they doneither. Newcomers will get the gist but be bored; veteran theater-goers will shrug.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

The general in charge here is the director Robert O'Hara, who has
done innovative, stellar work on shows like The  Brother/Sister  Plays
(Part  2)  and his own uproarious BootyCandy.  But this time his flashy
maneuvers serve no purpose, like marching soldiers here and therewithout any regard for the enemy of audience indifference. Forexample, I suppose the cast littering the stage at the beginning and
end suggests the price of war, but the idea   falls flat.
The moment of peak clarity for me came at a moment of peak
directorial confusion, when Harry goes among the troops before the
battle of Agincourt. Various cast-members repeat lines of text in
creepy chorus, moving this way and that, leaning on each other andintoning their words to very odd effect. All the moment need do is setthe scene: it's night and the French and English are camped so close toeach other that the fires of one army can light the faces of the other.
They are tense and nervous before the big battle to come, though
presumably the English are more nervous since they are so frightfullyoutnumbered. That's it. It's a simple description but O'Hara stages themoment in such a weird, unnecessary manner that it takes even those
familiar with the show a moment to get their bearings.
More defensible is the flurry of outrageous accents, from the Monty
Python-esque banter of the French to the Caribbean accents whenHarry argues with a common soldier who has no idea he's tradinginsults with the king. (Never has "me thinks" sounded so natural and I
wouldn't have minded if "I" had become "I and I".) Still, the accents
are so broad it becomes difficult to understand what they're saying.The haughty demeanor of Patrice Johnson's Montjoy told us all weneeded to know; did we need an accent so impenetrable it was hard to
grasp his actual dialogue? Ditto every scene with the French King (Joe
Tapper) and the Dauphin (the appealing Michael Bradley Cohen, oftenseen in dramas and so eager to goof off here one feels like telling him"get thee to a comedy").
But it's not just the French. Zenzi Williams as Henry has so many
scenes that she has the chance to land a few of them. But her two bigTHEATER: "HENRY V"

<p>battle speeches range from loud to louder and too often her dialogue is
delivered as poetry instead of prose, losing their meaning altogether.
Happy exceptions in the show include a rock solid David Ryan Smithas Exeter, et al and Ariel Shafir as Constable, et al. Surely it's tellingthat the best scene in the play took place between Katharine and Alice(Kim Wong). The darn thing is in French! But while Carolyn Kettig as
the princess takes her cue from O'Hara and goes broad, it is simply
and clearly staged and the audience immediately knows precisely whatis going on.
That leads to one other moment that's quite effective. At the finale,
Henry woos Katharine, a scene often presented as a romantic dessertafter the rest of the play. Here however, the warlike Henry tires ofKatharine's coy refusals to be wooed and nearly chokes her while
demanding -- quite sweetly -- that she kiss him. It's unnerving...and
would have been even better if the rest of the play had allowed us tosee that brutal side of Harry present or growing all along. Instead, it'sout of left field and soon passes. Still, for a moment we think, "Oh!That was interesting." A pity the rest of this production didn't build onthat idea or simply get out of the way of the story.
