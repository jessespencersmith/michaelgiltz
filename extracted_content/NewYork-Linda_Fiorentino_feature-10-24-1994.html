linda Fiorentino laugh, then ask, "A spiral down足
ward, isn't it?" After snaring a lead role in 1985's Vision 
Quest on her first audition, she got juicy roles in class acts 
by Martin Scorsese (After Hoursl and Alan Rudolph (The 
Modernsl. "Sometimes, I'll take a job because I need the 
money," she admits quite matter-of-factly. "I'll take the 
least offensive job I'm offered and then I'll pray to God it's 
never seen." That won't be the case with The Last Seduc足
tion, a modern-day noir that delivers on the promise of 
director John Dahl's Red Rock West-and should also deliv足
er a jolt to Florentino's career. As Bridget Gregory, she's a 
tough, deliciously manipulative scam artist who first dupes 
her husband out of every cent he has and then seduces a 
small-town rube to finish him off. Bridget, Fiorentino 
admits, has done more than just boost her profile. "She's 
so irredeemably evil and bitchy! In a way, it was therapeu足
tic to play the part. I didn't have PMS for six months after 
we wrapped." MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
