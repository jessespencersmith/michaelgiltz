8/26/2004 10:00:00 AMThat got your attention, didn't it? Everyone knows that when the GOPcomes to NYC, they're gonna get access to a whole passel ofBroadway shows. But the delicate sensibilities of the Republicansmeant they had to give a family values check and eliminate anyshows that might seem even remotely unseemly to anyone,anywhere. That meant cutting out lots of family favorite shows thatplay in the heartland like the Tony winner "Hairspray," HughJackman's campy turn in "The Boy From Oz" and -- Broadway beingBroadway -- many of the biggest draws in town. "Cats" is long gone,but they are free to check out the Bush-approved "The Lion King,""Aida" and two shows set in France (!) -- "Beauty and the Beast" and"The Phantom of the Opera."So where are those naked boys and when will they start singing? Itseems that one of the shows that WAS approved was the OffBroadway hit "Naked Boys Singing," which certainly would soundrisque and perhaps gay-ish to anyone with half a brain. But theRepublicans put it on their "approved" list. Obviously, they didn'trealize the show had boys. And they were naked. And they weresinging. Often about each other. (A rather amusing show, but theweakest number features two men having phone sex with each otherwhile singing a plaintive love duet.) Needless to say, someone puttwo and two together and finally got four and the show has beendropped. But not to worry -- before it was removed from the site forconvention goers, about a dozen people bought tickets. They know agood title when they see one. Enjoy!
