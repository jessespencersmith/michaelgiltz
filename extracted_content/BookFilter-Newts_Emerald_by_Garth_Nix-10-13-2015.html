Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayIn the last few years, I can't seem to read of a well-plotted historical romance without hearing the name of authorGeorgette Heyer. Her stock has clearly risen and if you dive into one of her highly entertaining tales, you'll know why.Still, drop Heyer's name and I'm a sucker, ready to give your novel a shot. Well, Garth Nix has a lot of fun combiningHeyer's plotting with a dash of magic a la the recent novel "Sorcerer To The Crown" by Zen Cho. This isn't quite asgood but Nix's pleasure is pretty infectious. It starts strongly: young Lady Truthful is the heir to a beautiful andpowerful emerald. When it's stolen, she heads to London and using a dash of illusion, investigates posing as a youngFrenchman. Before you can say "bodice-ripper" Truthful is tied up on a ship headed towards death with thehandsome but frustratingly rude Major Hartnett after they're discovered snooping around. In the best set-piece in thebook, Truthful uses her nautical knowledge to escape their trap, slow the ship, and engineer their rescue.Unfortunately, that's about it for Truthful using her smarts. She's sidelined by the men (and to be fair doesn't like itone bit) until a supernatural showdown where outwitting ones opponent barely comes into play. It's a pity because byand large this is fun with amusing characters and some satisfying banter. It just feels poorly thought out at the endand rather rushed romantically. Nix clearly has an affinity for this genre. If he can mix in a little complexity in hischaracters and follow through on his set-up rather than coasting on it, he'll be able to stake his claim morecompletely. For an example of how it's done, one need only check out Heyer herself. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“A surprise from Garth Nix: A Regency romance with magic. Charming; quite, quite charming.” (Gail Carriger, NewYork Times bestselling author of the Parasol Protectorate and the Finishing School series) “Part comedy of manners,part fantasy adventure, this lighthearted romp is ridiculous fun.” (Booklist (starred review)) “A delightful romp withdastardly plots and romantic confusions that would do Jane Austen proud. Fans of the author and of fantasy orRegency romance will enjoy this tale immensely. (School Library Journal) “Entertaining.” (Kirkus Reviews) “Thisromance should please the author’s regular readers and Georgette Heyer fans alike.” (Publishers Weekly)What You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
