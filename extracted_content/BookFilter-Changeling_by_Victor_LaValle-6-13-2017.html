From the Publisher: “If the literary gods mixed together Haruki Murakami
and Ralph Ellison, the result would be Victor LaValle.”—Anthony Doerr,
author of All the Light We Cannot See  When Apollo Kagwa’s father
disappeared, all he left his son were strange recurring dreams and a box
of books stamped with the word IMPROBABILIA. Now Apollo is a fatherhimself—and as he and his wife, Emma, are settling into their new lives as
parents, exhaustion and anxiety start to take their toll. Apollo’s old
dreams return and Emma begins acting odd. Irritable and disconnectedfrom their new baby boy, at first Emma seems to be exhibiting signs ofpostpartum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles goeven deeper. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a
horrific act—beyond any parent’s comprehension—and vanishes, seemingly
into thin air. Thus begins…

What We Say
Here is a modern fairy tale set in New York City. Not a Disney-fied fairy tale with a neat little message of uplift and a
happy ending. Uh-uh. This is one of those dark fairy tales, the unexpurgated versions preserved for adults complete withviolence and undertones of sex and in which the main message is one of caution: the world is a lot stranger and scarier
than you're willing to admit. It's a Grimm fairy tale with the grimness front and center. LaValle burst onto the scene with
his excellent short story collection "Slapboxing With Jesus," followed up by the bleak but mordantly funny novel "TheEcstatic." He might have continued in this literary, "New Yorker" friendly vein. But LaValle has found his purchase inShare This Book

<p>subverting genres like sci-fi and horror, playing off H.P. Lovecraft and the like. So here he begins in compelling mode,
telling of the romance and marriage of a young couple up to the point when the wife Emma gives birth on a stalled subway
train in a scene that is charm itself, down to the street performers who gamely hide the intimate moment from camera-
phone wielding passengers peering in from other cars. Then things go wrong. The wife becomes more and more depressed(postpartum?) and the husband simply doesn't know what to do, other than beg her to keep taking the medicine she's beenprescribed. Things go truly off the rails in a way that will terrify any new parent, tapping into your darkest fears aboutwhether you (or your spouse) is up for the daunting task of raising a child to that moment when you realize the child has a
mind of their own. Part "Rosemary's Baby" (the movie, not the book), part Stephen King, LaValle's story is emotionally rich
long before it treads into dark fantasy territory. Our hero Apollo Kagwa -- a latch-key kid turned avid purveyor of rare andprecious books -- is a memorable character, a father who does whatever he must to protect his child but never fails toremember you can't protect your child by destroying who you are. It's creepy and fun and unexpected and if I wasn't whollyon board by the end (horror isn't quite my thing), I have to respect a book that I put aside once or twice because it was
freaking me out a little. If you've just welcomed a newborn into the world, you might want to wait a while before reading
this.... -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
Advance praise for  The Changeling
“A dark fairy tale of New York, full of magic and loss, myth and mystery, love and madness.  The Changeling  is a
mesmerizing, monumental work.” —Marlon James, author of  A Brief History of Seven Killings
“Like a good Coen brothers film, this genre-defying, achingly literate phantasmagoria of a novel will work every
nook and cranny of the imagination, taking the reader to places we’re either too afraid to visit or never knewexisted.” —Paul Beatty, author of  The Sellout
“This year, the most unsettling novel I read, the scariest novel I read, and the most beautiful novel I read wereall the same one—Victor  LaValle’s  The Changeling . A father who loses his wife and child in an act of horror must
hunt them into metaphorical hell to get them back again. This story feels less written, than channeled. I say thiswithout exaggeration: It’s a masterpiece.” —Mat Johnson, author of  Pym and Loving Day
“LaValle has a knack for blending social realism with genre tropes, and this blend of horror story and fatherhood
fable is surprising and admirably controlled.…
