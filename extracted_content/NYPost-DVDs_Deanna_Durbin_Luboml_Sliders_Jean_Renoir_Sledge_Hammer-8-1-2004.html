OJ z Deanna Durbin 
Sweetheart Pack * * * 
Universal; $26.98 
Mostly forgotten now, -
teenage sensation Deanna 
Durbin came to the rescue 
of Universal with a series 
of smash hit movies like 
her debut -1936's silly 
romp "Three Smart 
Girls" -included here 
with five more fine 
films. She was plucky, 
sang songs at the drop 
of a hat and walked 
away from stardom 
after only eight years 
to marry and settle 
down. Also just out: 
"The Best of Abbott & 
Costello Volume 3" 
with eight (!) titles 
(Universal; $26.98) and 
"The Complete Gidget 
Collection" (Columbia 
Pictures; $27.95). 
Luboml: My Heart 
Remembers 
*** Cinema Guild; $295 ..... ~""'"' " 
,J-
The documentary "Luboml" 
walks in the steps of "Shoah" 
by avoiding big questions and 
focusing on facts. What was life 
like in this typical Polish shtetl, 
destroyed by the Nazis? It 
describes the main market, the 
impressive temple, work, 
marriage, and so on with dry足
eyed exactness. Without 
romanticizing it, the 
filmmakers use archival photos 
and interviews with survivors 
to bring Luboml to life again. 
Available at 
www.cinemaguild.com. 
Sliders -the First 
and Second Seasons 
*** Universal; $89.98 
Jerry O'Connell spent four sea足
sons slipping from one alter足
nate universe to the next, 
thanks to his home-built worm-hole, and this silly sci-fi show 
even continued after he left. But 
only the first two seasons fea足
ture the complete original cast 
(including John Rhys-Davies as 
Professor Arturo) and they're 
both in this boxed set. The 
extras include nifty packaging 
and audio commentary. 
Stage & S~cle/ 
Jean Renoir 
***'/2 Criterion; $79.95 
Late in his career, Jean Renoir 
dove into the world of the 
theater with three acclaimed 
films: "The Golden Coach 
(1953)," "French Cancan (1955)" 
and "Elena and Her Men (1956):" 
Bursting with Technicolor 
brilliance and stars like Anna 
Magnani and Ingrid Bergman, 
they're beautifully packaged in 
this boxed set. The many extras 
include intros by Martin 
Scorsese and a lengthy 
interview with Renoir. 
Sledge Hammer! 
Season One 
*** Anchor Bay; $39.98 
David Rasche is hilarious as the 
gun-loving-cop who talks to his 
weapon and tells people, "Trust 
me, I know what I'm doing." 
Extras include a documentary, 
audio commentary by the 
creator, early scripts and the 
unaired pilot.</p>
