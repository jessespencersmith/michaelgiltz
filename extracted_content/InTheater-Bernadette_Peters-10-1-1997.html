(Perhaps the animators took inspira­
tion from an early review of Peters in 
The New York Post which said, "She has 
a rear end like a Bartlett pear.") Peters 
still hasn't seen the finished film, but 
she's an old hand at animation; she's 
been tile voice of Rita on the cartoon 
series Aninzaniacs for several years, 
attracting a new generations of fans. 
Of course, because she's been so active in other 
areas. "I'm too busy to be frustrated," 
she laughs. (One upcoming possibili­
ty is Kander and Ebb's The Skin of 
Our Teeth.) 
It's also easy for theatergoers to 
forget what an impressive body of 
work she's done for Tv, including 
David, Falling Fronz G1·ace with Kevin 
Spacey and The Last Best Year with 
Mary Tyler 
Moore, who has 
become one of 
her best friends. 
In fact, Peters 
was married to 
investment 
adviser Michael 
Wittenberg in 
Moore's home 
last year. 
"Her hus­
my band and 
husband were 
cut from the 
same cloth," Pe­
ters says fondly. 
"Now they've 
become pals, 
too." seeing Peters in 
person is one of 
the delights of 
the musical the­
ater -witness 
her career-defin­
ing perfor­
mances in such 
shows as Mack 
and Mabel and 
Song & Dance, 
along with the 
fact that Sond­
heim has en­
joyed his most 
popular success­
es when Peters 
was treading the 
boards for him. 
That makes the 
long gaps 111 
her Broadway And fans Peters will be joined by original co· 
stars Chip Zien and Joanna Gleason in 
the reunion concert of 'nto the Woods. know they don't 
need a Broad­
way show for a chance to see Peters in 
her element. "I love doing concerts," 
she says. "I can choose what I want to 
sing, and I'd rather do that than a 
musical that isn't interesting to me." 
Her love for live performance is the 
reason why Sondheinz, Etc. (Angel), last 
year's CD taped at Carnegie Hall, is 
easily the highlight of her recording 
career. Certainly it outshines I'll Be 
Yozt?' Baby Tonight, a crossover album 
that earned her a Grammy nomina­
tion, but didn't break through on the 
pop charts. Future plans include more 
live recordings ("I think it's a great way 
for me to record; you just know when 
you're connecting with the material") 
and some intimate combo work -
when her crowded schedule permits. appearances all the more distressing: 
10 years between Mack and Mabel and 
Sunday in the Pa1·k With Geo1"ge; six 
years between Into the Woods and The 
Goodbye Girl, her most recent. 
But Peters is convincing when she 
says that the lack of interesting new 
musicals hasn't bothered her, if only 
With husband Michael Wittenberg. 
InTheater "I like doing the project where 
the work is the best," Peters says 
simply. "It can be on film, it can be 
on stage, it can be on television. 
When you are able to pick and 
choose, you don't get bored." •</p>
