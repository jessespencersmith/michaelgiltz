Practically Poppins in Every Way
BOOKFILTER’S ANNUAL HOLIDAY BOOK GUIDE FOR
THEATER LOVERS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | NOVEMBER 20, 2018
SHARE</p>
<p>By Jeff Kurtti
$50, Disney Editions
Disney’s success on Broadway has been remarkable, from its sterling debut with Beauty and the
Beast  (one of the best scores of all time) to The Lion King  and the current blockbuster Aladdin.
A little lost amid all the hits (like Aida ) and some misfires (like The Little Mermaid and Tarzan )?
Mary Poppins.  That sterling show is among the 25 longest-running hits in Broadway history! And
now a new feature film continues the story. This coffee table–worthy book by Jeff Kurtti is muchmore than a visually appealing celebration of the franchise. It covers the history of Mary Poppinsin all her incarnations, from the beloved books by the prickly P.L. Travers to the classic featurefilm that earned Julie Andrews an Oscar to its stage debut in London … and now back again tothe silver screen this December with Mary Poppins Returns  (costarring Lin-Manuel Miranda)!
Filled with essays and anecdotes by the likes of theater giants Cameron Macintosh and ThomasSchumacher, Disney historians, and many others, it’s the perfect setup for those eagerlyanticipating the new movie. And will anyone be surprised if Mary Poppins Returns  actually
returns the practically perfect nanny to Broadway some day? Hardly.
Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know</p>
<p>By Colm Tóibín
$26, Scribner
Colm Tóibín is a widely acclaimed writer who broke through with the bestseller Brooklyn,  a novel
turned into an Oscar-nominated film. Here, the journalist, essayist, and critic delivers a nonfiction
book about three iconic figures who loom large in Irish history and the overwhelming influenceof their fathers. Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats, and James Joyce are the artists Tóibín tackles,showing how the love (and often lack thereof) from their fathers and the careers those patriarchspursued shaped the talents we know so well. All three have varied links to theater. “The Dead,”Joyce’s final story from his collection Dubliners,  is turning into a holiday perennial via a staged
production in New York City. And Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest  is the first among
many popular plays by him that have taken a permanent place in the repertory. Anyoneinterested in these talents or simply fascinated by the push-and-pull of fathers and sons will findmuch to mull over here.
Hearts Unbroken</p>
<p>By Cynthia Leitich Smith
$17.99, Candlewick
Maybe the premise of this young-adult novel will sound outrageous to you. In Hearts Unbroken,
Louise Wolfe is a proud Native American teen living in a mostly white middle-class Kansas town.When her little brother is cast as the Tin Man in the school’s production of The Wizard of Oz,well, that sounds great. But as a journalist on the school paper, Lou (as she’s known) findsherself covering backlash to the director’s inclusive casting. A protest group called ParentsAgainst Revisionist Theatre is soon speaking up, anonymous threats are flying, and the kids inthe cast are bearing the brunt of long-buried animosity and prejudice. Yikes! But don’t worry:Lou finds the time to develop a romance with the school paper’s photographer, even if it can betricky to “date while Native.” If you find yourself wondering how author Cynthia Leitich Smithcame up with such a crazy idea, you might check out recent news stories from North Carolina.Parents in Mitchell County held a prayer vigil after a high school performance of the lightcomedy The Complete Works of Shakespeare (Abridged)  shocked them with its references to
alcohol consumption, suicide, and a queer kiss. So, not so crazy! (And Hamlet,  we’re guessing,
will not be mounted any time soon.)

<p>By Carol de Giere
$29.99, Applause Books
Composer-lyricist Stephen Schwartz gets the full biography treatment he deserves in Defying
Gravity.  Now, this new paperback edition covers his entire career, along with added material

The Secrets of Noh Masks</p>
<p>By Michishige Udaka
$25, Kodansha USA
For 600 years, Noh drama has been a radically simple mainstay of Japanese theater. It is acting
pared down to its essence: Actors, minimal props, and Noh masks all work in concert to tellstories with nuance and a remarkable range of emotions. It’s enjoying a new peak in popularity,and who better to discuss it than Michishige Udaka, the rare talent who both acts and crafts hisown Noh masks? Most Noh masks are precious and antique works of art, handed down fromartist to artist or kept as key resources by legendary theatrical companies. Udaka is the onlyperson to teach, write, act, and craft his own Noh masks. This gorgeous book showcases some30 masks in all their beauty and subtle range of character, along with his insights into both thecraft of making them and acting with them. For fans of Japan and serious theater buffs alike.

You might be tempted to see his clear-eyed notes as useful advice inmany settings. You’d be right, but this is more how-to than self-help. It’s vital, however, foranyone who wants to collaborate on theater in any way and lets fans peek behind the curtain atall the work that goes into the shows they will eventually enjoy. Most everyone in theater saystheir favorite period is rehearsal — the period when they’re getting a new show onto its feet —so why not find out exactly what’s going on?

Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution</p>
<p>By Todd S. Purdum
$32, Henry Holt & Co
This brisk and lively biography of the greatest team in musical-theater history happily remains
focused on what matters most: the shows. Author Todd S. Purdum begins by covering their livesand careers up to that fateful partnership, reminding us that Oscar Hammerstein (Show Boat )
and Richard Rodgers (Rodgers & Hart) had already accomplished enough to be rememberedforever even before they met. Then Purdum devotes about a chapter to each major work and theincreasing business activity that surrounds colossal success. Rodgers and Hammerstein werethe boldest and most fascinating of talents, pushing boundaries on what stories a musical couldtell, how they would tell them, and doing it all with songs that are so precise and deceptivelysimple that everyone can sing them — yet, in the right hands, they reveal passionate depths.Purdum doesn’t shy away from the personal, including Hammerstein’s insecurities, Rodgerschasing after showgirls, or battles with depression and alcoholism. But it’s always in the contextof how personal matters affected their relationship and their shows.  Something
Wonderful  doesn’t rock the boat with any unexpected claims for this show or damning of that
work. It’s a solid, affectionate description of artists who look more important today than at anytime since, oh, 1945.
And Then We Danced
By Henry Alford</p>
<p>$26, Simon & Schuster
Henry Alford is this generation’s Bill Plimpton, a writer who dives into a topic by actually diving
in. Here, Alford tells the story of the history of dance while sharing his own experience of usingdance lessons to boost his confidence. Part popular history and part memoir, you get thumbnailsketches of artists such as Twyla Tharp and George Balanchine along with the origins ofeverything from tap to ballroom to swing and even Zumba. (Alford wrote a hugely popular articlefor The New York Times  about taking Zumba lessons, which led to this book.) By the time he’s
dancing with Alzheimer’s patients as part of their therapy, you’ll be laughing and tearing up atthe same time. Read it before the heart-tugging film version does a tango with Oscar.

Dear Evan Hansen: The Novel</p>
<p>By Val Emmich, with Steven Levenson, Benj Pasek, and Justin Paul
$18.99, Poppy
This has to be the most anticipated theater book of the year , a young adult adaptation of the
show with writer Val Emmich building on the book, music, and lyrics of Steven Levenson and the
team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Has a Broadway show ever been turned into a YA novelbefore? I don’t think so. It stands on its own, so those who can’t get to Broadway or wait for thenational tour to come to their town will be able to dive into this story and this world right away.Though if they play the cast album while reading it, well, who could blame them?
Failing Up</p>
<p>By Leslie Odom Jr.

to film and, of course, theater. Tony winner Leslie Odom Jr. might just do all of that, and now
he’s tossed in publishing for good measure. In this memoir/self-help guide, Odom uses thecommencement address speech as a way to share how he struggled, fought, and “failed up” onhis way to  Hamilton  and the role of a lifetime. He debuted on Broadway at the age of 17
in Rent  (another show with a historic original cast) and hasn’t looked back since.

Beyond</p>

Verlizzo, one of the most acclaimed artists on Broadway.
