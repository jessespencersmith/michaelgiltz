Flower Girl
Céline Sciamma made headlines when she came out at Cannes while getting rave
reviews for her directorial debut film, Water Lilies.  Now the film is ready to take
on an American audience.
By Michael Giltz
An Advocate.com exclusive posted  April 4, 2008
Writer and director Celine Sciamma makes it look easy. Her first directorial
effort, Water Lilies  -- a delicate but sharp-edged look at three 15-year-old girls
exploring their sexuality against the backdrop of synchronized swimming --
debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival to rave reviews.
Just two days later, with the world at her feet and boundless new possibilities,
Sciamma came out with casual aplomb to The Advocate.  Now her film is
coming to America, giving U.S. moviegoers a chance to see her work.Sciamma always thought of herself as basically a writer, but apparently that’s
going to have to change.
“I really enjoyed doing the movie,” admits the 27-year-old. “I felt like I was at home. So I can’t
say I am not a director. But in terms of career and what is your job, what is your craft? I really
enjoy writing too. The future will tell.”
Water Lilies  looks at three very different girls: Anne, a heavyset girl exceptionally eager to lose
her virginity; Floriane, a sexy girl who loves to flirt but is a little overwhelmed by the effect her
body has on boys and older men; and our heroine, Marie (a gawky Pauline Acquart), who isfriends with Anne but obsessed with Floriane as only a teenager on hormones can be. In one
hilariously driven scene, Anne is so besotted with Floriane that Anne steals her trash and even
eats scraps of food that Floriane has thrown away.
In an unexpected way, Sciamma is using homosexuality to get viewers to see the story of first
love with fresh eyes.
