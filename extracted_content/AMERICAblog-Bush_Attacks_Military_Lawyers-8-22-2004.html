8/22/2004 10:22:00 PMThe Bush show trials of those non-entities known as prisoners atGuantanamo Bay is picking up steam. But since it's not enough tobelittle the Red Cross, the Geneva Convention and all standards ofdecency (see Abu Ghraib), Bush is now taking out his anger on themilitary lawyers saddled with the miserable task of defending theseprisoners under conditions that most lawyers would findunacceptable.The military lawyers actually have done a spectacular job of providingexcellent counsel by attacking the very legitimacy of the proceedings,giving it all a far more respectable air than they deserved --something for which Bush should be grateful. Instead, these men andwomen are paying for fulfilling their oaths and their duties by havingtheir careers torpedoed."One of those lawyers, Lt. Cmdr. Philip Sundel, said he accepted thejob after the Navy's top lawyer said it would be a historic opportunity.'Not historic enough, I guess,' Commander Sundel said in aninterview."'I found out in June I was not selected for promotion for the secondyear in a row,' said Commander Sundel, who has a strong reputationas a trial lawyer. Under the military's system that emphasizespromotion or resignation, he will leave the service. Asked if hebelieved the promotion denial was related to his representation of AliHamza Ahmed Sulayman al-Bahlul of Yemen and his strong criticismof the tribunal system, he said: 'I have no way of knowing if itadversely impacted my situation. It didn't positively impact, itseems.'"
