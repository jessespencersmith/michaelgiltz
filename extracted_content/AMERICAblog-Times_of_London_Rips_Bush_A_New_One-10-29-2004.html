10/29/2004 12:28:00 PMWho better than the Brits to go all medieval on Bush? The Times ofLondon delivers a fiery denouncement of Bush that makes clear howlow we've sunk in the eyes of the world. A little taste of theirbrimstone:"The primary function of democracy is not to elect good leaders, sincenobody can predict in advance how a politician will perform. It is toeject leaders who have manifestly failed. The ability to removeleaders who turn out to be corrupt, dangerous, outrageouslydishonest or manifestly incompetent is the primary privilege and dutyof any democracy. And if any leader in our lifetime deserved to beejected by voters, regardless of their ideology or political persuasion,it is surely President Bush," writes the Times of London."To make matters worse, Mr Bush has failed in all these tasks, whilebreaking every promise he made about his character and leadershipstyle. Instead of running a bipartisan government of national unity,he has been the most ideological, divisive and extremist leaderAmerica has ever seen. Instead of showing humility in hisinternational dealings, his punitive and aggressive foreign policies —not only against Iraq but also against North Korea, Venezuela, Iranand even Germany and France — have transformed America into themost hated country on earth. Instead of respecting the primacy ofthe US Constitution, he has imprisoned thousands of people withouttrial or charge — many no doubt dangerous terrorists, but somepresumably just ordinary people caught in the wrong place at thewrong time."Thanks to Mike in Texas for the heads-up on this item.
