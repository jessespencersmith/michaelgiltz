            <p>T H U R S D AY,  J A N U A RY  2 5 ,  2 0 0 7The Oscar Nominations: What Show Will TheyMake?You can look at the Oscar nominations two ways. One, you can ofcourse look for your favorite movies, see what films got snubbed, enjoyOscar trivia (like "Dreamgirls" being the first film in decades to get themost nods without Best Picture being one of them) and so on. Two, ifyou're a future producer of the Academy Awards show (like myself) youlook at the nominations and immediately start thinking about whatkind of show you're going to have. It gets "cast," really by thenominations, just like the Grammys get cast by who gets a vote.First off, the ratings will be in trouble. Yes, a close race brings inviewers, but big hit films do it even better. None of the five nominatedfilms are blockbusters. Martins Scorsese's "The Departed" is a solid hitand the biggest film of his career with $121 million, not a stellarnumber for a movie that cost $90 million to make, but that was theirfault for paying that much for a Scorsese film in the first place."Departed" also surely played much better with men, while the Oscarsis a female magnet. "Babel" is a decent indie hit with $23 million andcounting. "Letters From Iwo Jima" has made $2.4 million and followsthe relative flop companion piece "Flags Of Our Fathers." "The Queen"is certainly an art house hit at $35 million and counting, but most of itsaudience is decidedly older. (How many people under 30 have seen it?30?) Only "Little Miss Sunshine" constitutes a crowd-pleasing favoritethanks to Steve Carell of "The Office" and a seriously leggyperformance at the box office, with $60 million and a DVD release justout.In short:The Departed -- $120 million and few womenBabel -- $23 millionLetters From Iwo Jima -- $2.4 million and few womenLittle Miss Sunshine -- $60 millionThe Queen -- $35 million and no fans under 65It's pretty simple. People watch the Oscars to see how movies they likedwill do.
