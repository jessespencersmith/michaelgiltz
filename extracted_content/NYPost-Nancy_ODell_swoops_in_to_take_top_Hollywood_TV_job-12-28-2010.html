TV is filled with stories of stars who moved in at the last minute to
snatch up a marquee job.
Jay Leno cut in front of David Letterman when Johnny Carson retired. Dan Rather hip-checked
Roger Mudd out of the way for Walter Cronkite's chair.
When it was announced a few weeks ago that Nancy O'Dell would be succeeding the retiring
"Entertainment Tonight " anchor Mary Hart -- and not Lara Spencer, the longtime host of the
"The Insider " and Hart's heir apparent -- you could have heard a pin drop on Hollywood
Boulevard.
It's one of the more astonishing TV coups of the past few years and O'Dell, who quit her job as
anchor of " Access Hollywood " last December, promises it wasn't planned.
First of all, O'Dell told The Post, she stillhad two years left on her contract.
"And I'm sure 'Access' wouldn't have let
me out of my contract if they had known"
that "ET" was interested, laughs O'Dell.
That's sort of the point. Everyone in the
TV business believed the job was taken.
Last August, when Hart announced she
was leaving "ET" after nearly 30 years, itwas widely believed Spencer would get
the top job. "ET" executive producer
Linda Bell Blue had reportedly coaxedSpencer to move her family to LA with
the promise of eventually replacing Hart.
But, according to an industry insider, the
decision to go with O'Dell was CBSboss Les Moonves' (his network owns
"ET"), who apparently believed O'Dell
was the best way to maintain warm tiesto celebrities.
O'Dell says she anticipated none of this
when she walked away from "Access."

EXCLUSIVE: Lindsay Lohan’s Team Says SheWasn't Fired From 'Inferno'
Fri, 26 Nov 2010 05:07:33 GMT
Black Eyed Peas to Perform During Super Bowl's
"I had feelers out there and had taken
meetings," she says. But there'd been
no promise of an "ET" job.
She landed a few smaller jobs right
away: a reality competition show for
Oprah Winfrey's OWN network thatdebuts next month, as well as a chance
to host Fox's New Year's Eve special
this Friday night.
It all came about because O'Dell was
unhappy at "Access Hollywood," sources say."It didn't feel like the right fit anymore," says O'Dell. "I think after you reach a certain level of
maturity and a certain point in your career and you know what you want and what you feel goodabout, you know when it's time to make a change.
" 'ET' is the gold standard," she says. "Celebrities trust it and they know what they're going to get
when they go on. Obviously, audiences like it too."
Her first day on the job at "ET" -- where she is a correspondent until next May -- "felt weirdly like
home," says O'Dell.
"The people feel right, the executives feel right, the fellow correspondents feel right, the way the
show is -- the classiness  -- feels right. It was such a great confirmation. Yeah, I felt I made the
right decision."
As O'Dell jokes, the switch isn't that jarring."Everybody already thought I worked at 'Entertainment Tonight' anyway," she says.
"It was frustrating when I worked at 'Access' . . . I would walk through an airport and people would
say, 'Nancy O'Dell! Da-da-da-da-da-da!' They'd sing the 'Entertainment Tonight' theme song!"

AM DISAPPPOIONTED ABOUT O'DELL. WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A BRAND NEW
EXCITING PERSONALITY. O'DELL IS NOT THAT! ALSO, I WISH YOU PEOPLE WHO WRITE
ABOUT SHOW "BUSONESS" WOULD STOP STICKING THE KNIFE INTO JAY LENO. LENO
DID NOTHING WRONG. WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ABOUT EVERY SAG MEMBER WHO HADA JOB & WAS YANKED & REPLACED BY SOMEONE ELSE. THIS VENDETTA AGAINST
LENO IS TRULY ABSURD. IF CONAN O'BRIEN HADN'T BEEN SUCH AN IMMATURE
WHINING CHILD & JUST LEFT LIKE THE MAJORITY OF OTHER SAG MEMBERS WHEN
AXED - LENO WOULD NOT BE THE TOP LIST FOR A PUBLIC HANGING. ENOUGH IS
ENOUGH. PROBLEM IS THAT "YOU FOLKS" WHO PURPORT TO KNOW ABOUT SHOW"BUSINESS" REALLY KNOW NOTHING. OF COURSE, THAT'S IN ADDITION TO "YOUwww.VillanovaU.com/
