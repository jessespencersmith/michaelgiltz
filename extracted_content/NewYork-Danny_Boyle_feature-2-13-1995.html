            <p>Tale t igging Shallow Grave For Danny Boyle-the director of Shallow Grave, a tougb little thriller about three 
thoroughly unlikable roommates who become increasingly paranoid after stumbling 
upon a suitcase stuffed with cash-playing nasty has paid off. Since word of the 
Scottish film hit these shores, Hollywood has been coming on hot and heavy. "They took 
us out to dinner last night at Mortons, which is quite famous, I believe," Boyle says by 
phone from Los Angeles. "Us" is 
he, producer Andrew MacDon­
ald, and writer John Hodge, a trio 
determined to stick together and 
not be swayed---cushy dinners 
notwithstanding-by the lure of 
money. "To be honest," he says, 
"we could do our next movie, 
Train Spotting [the story of hero­
in addicts, budgeted at $1.5 mil­
lion], for $4 million because 
Shallow Grave's done really well 
in the U_K. and Australia. You 
could raise the money on the strength of that. And it would be a disaster. There's no way 
you can think there's that amount of people who are going to want to watch it." That abil­
ity to keep things in their proper perspective also works in reverse: The making of Shallow 
Grave (opening February 10 at Village Theatre VII and Lincoln Square) involved an ambi­
tious indoor set, the largest ever built in Scotland. It houses the characters' terrific apart­
ment, complete with a roomy attic perfect for drilling holes to peep down on roommates. 
"It was so big," says Boyle. "When it was half built, everybody thought, myself included, 
'Oh no, what have we done? This is going to look like we set the film inside a stadium.' And 
that's the really good thing about a low-budget film. You can't change your mind when you 
make a bold decision because there's absolutely no way out." MICHAn GILTl</p>
