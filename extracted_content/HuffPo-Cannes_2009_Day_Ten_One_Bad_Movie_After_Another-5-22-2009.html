 Cannes 2009 Day Ten: One Bad
Movie After Another
Read More:  Cannes Film Festival, Gasper Noe , Gay , Heath
Ledger , Johnny Depp , Terry Gilliam , Entertainment News
I wanted to see six films today, but the Gasper
Noe extravaganza Enter The Void  was not the
estimated 150 minutes but almost 180 minutes(without credits, no less), so I only saw five. Toobad they were all bad, to one degree or another.
On the plus side, one of my picks of the fest --
Xavier Dolan's I Killed My Mother  -- won three
out of the four available prizes at the DirectorsFortnight. I had already requested an interview
so hopefully we'll be chatting Saturday or
Sunday. And now, sigh, the five movies.
THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS  * 1/2 (out of four) -- This modest fantasy feels
like a mishmash of the usual Terry Gilliam obsessions, but less so. A traveling troupe led byChristopher Plummer as Dr. Parnassus scurries around central London of today hoping to lure
people into their magical mirror. On the other side? A fantastical world of the imagination where
you are tempted with a choice between your basest desires (a one night stand with Johnny Depp; adrink at the bar for an alcoholic on the wagon) and a more challenging journey towards true and
earned happiness. People usually choose the base desires. Tom Waits is lingering around in
bohemian mode as Ole Scratch himself waiting for the lovely daughter of Dr. Parnassus to turn 16so he can claim her. (They made a deal: immortal life in exchange for his first born child.) Theappealing Andrew Garfield is a foundling they took in that is hopelessly in love with her. Heath
Ledger is a disgraced public figure/con man hiding out from the Russian mob. When he travels
into the imaginary world, he transforms into Depp or Jude Law or Colin Farrell -- a seamless wayof making up for Ledger's tragic death that doesn't seem awkward or affect the film in the least
creatively. The story is slight and uninspiring; you know you're in trouble right from the start
because virtually every actor other than the leads is broadly cartoonish. But for me the biggestletdown of this mild movie is the special effects. Gilliam has been a standard bearer of sorts for
old-fashioned special effects. You can feel the handmade complexity and detailed modeling that
make Baron Munchausen, Brazil, Time Bandits  and others so delightful. But almost all the effects

<p>Michael Giltz: Cannes 2009 Day Ten: One Bad Movie After Another
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/cannes-2009-day-ten-one-b_b_206982.html [6/23/2009 5:39:33 PM]in the Imaginarium are poorly detailed digital affect. You could call them dream-like but they're
really just lazy and uninteresting. Ledger is fine in an unmemorable role with little resonance. We'll
remember nis final triumph as The Dark Knight and celebrate the comradeship of the industryillustrated by the actors who stepped in to make this film happen.
THE SILENT ARMY  * -- The road to cinematic hell is often paved with good intentions. This
noble, purposeful film highlights the horrific trend of child soldiers throughout Africa: kids
kidnapped by rebels/terrorists and forced to commit atrocities while being shamed/frightened into
denying your past life. Numerous other films have been made and more are in the works but noneyet have been artistically satisfying in the least. This one is typical: little black boy is best friendswith little white boy. Black boy's family is slaughtered and he's taken to be a child soldier. Whiteboy shames dad into idiotic journey into jungle to get the boy back. (I've reduced the characters to
their racial identity because the film is so simple-minded. That's how it plays; no one comes alive
as an actual living and breathing character.) Virtually all the actors are weak. An NGO worker
spends all her time making a bemused/frustrated/admiring expression on her face when it comes
to the dad. In perhaps the most bizarre plot twist, the dad reaches the rebels, gets the boy, and isallowed to leave with two armed guards accompanying them. Cut to them walking through thejungle and the dad jumps the guards and tries to knock them out, figuring he won't be let out alive.
But then they pull back the camera and instead of waiting till he was a mile or two away from the
armed camp filled with trigger happy rebels, the dad has made his big move literally feet away
from the cruel and vicious leader and all his minions. Because why wait till you're out of sight of
the enemy before jumping your armed guards? Laughable doesn't begin to cover it.
ENTER THE VOID  * 1/2 -- Gasper Noe's follow-up to his terrific Irreversible  is a nearly three
hour glimpse at a young man who is shot by the police, arguably has his life flash before his eyes
and then gets reincarnated as his sister's baby. It's technically proficient, but once you've seen afly-over shot of Tokyo or rather once you've seen it eight or ten times the point of seeing it yet
again begins to pale. Two orphaned siblings are at the heart of the story: a sister who strips at a
Tokyo bar and a brother who is dealing drugs. At the very beginning of the film, overly aggressivepolice trying to bust him shoot the brother in the chest. We soon get loads of flashbacks showing
how he became a dealer, seeing their parents die in a car crash, watching the brother sleep with a
friend's mom to get money, getting drugs from a dealer and on and on, all while our hero refersendlessly to The Tibetan Book Of The Dead in order to prepare us for the reincarnation. The show-
stopper here is certainly the shot of a penis entering a vagina...from the perspective of inside the
vagina.  That brought roars of laughter from the assembled press, which at the end broke into
divisive camps of loud hooting and strong applause. To me, the movie is so simple-minded that no
camerawork can save it. Certainly the acting is affectless and flat, except for the brother and sisterplayed as little children -- those young actors are very nuanced and good. It literally begins with
death and ends with birth and I wanted to break out into "The Circle Of Life." A blank screen is
thrown in towards the end for no apparent purpose other than to trick people into thinking theworld is over. It began with a giant ENTER filling the sreen and ended with a giant THE and then
VOID. Surprising, it ain't. It's conceivable that the film could be more effective at half the length
and it would certainly be easy to do since there is endless repetition here that doesn't give it anycumulative power. On the other hand, I stayed awake throughout the entire three hours and never
felt antsy except on an intellectual level. It's certainly well-crafted; it's just not well-thought out.
MAPS OF THE SOUNDS OF TOKYO  No stars -- Enter The Void  immediately looked better
when I had to tackle this inert drama. The entire story is set up in the first 20 minutes and after
that virtually nothing happens. A Spanish man in Tokyo has been dating the daughter of a businessexecutive; she commits suicide and writes in blood on her bathroom mirror the plea "Why couldn'tyou love me the way I love you?" Her father has a breakdown and tells an associate he can't bear
the thought of a world in which his daughter is dead and the Spanish man is alive. The
businessman also blames his young associate, insisting that man should also have told the daughterhe loved her. Meanwhile, the Spanish man is having great sex with a female fish monger/highly
trained assassin (you read that right) but insists on telling her repeatedly that when he sleeps with
her he is thinking of the dead girl. Which kind of spoils the mood. Extremely reserved, the fishmonger/trained assassin is friends with an old man who specializes in making sound recordings ofdaily life for the use of TV, radio and other media. That's it. The Spanish man ultimately leaves his
wine shop in Tokyo to open a saki store in Spain. The old man gives us ponderous narration
undercut somewhat by the sight of a Night Ranger LP in his apartment looming over the old man'shead. Not good.

from newer and sexier talent. Her drug addict boyfriend cleans her out whenever he needs a fix and
is in the gutter somewhere. Meanwhile, her alienated son pops in. He's in the military and we see
him on a nighttime training mission where the son has sex with another male soldier and thenimmediately kills the guy out of self-loathing. He's gone AWOL and demands to be hidden whilethe drug addict boyfriend trying to get past withdrawal is in the next room hanging himself. Did I
mention her breasts are leaking blood and she's probably dying? None of this is played at the level
of farce. It's just somber, slow and uninvolving, with a side trip to another home wheretransvestites hold sway in the countryside. One strange touch had several scenes tinted blue or reda la a silent film, with the actors coming to a standstill while a song is performed off camera.Strange. But, again, not good.

I never liked Gaspar Noe's work. Irreversible is an overrated, shallow piece of filmmaking.
Once you get past the shock value (and it has tons of shock value), it's a simplistic movie thatcovers up its emptiness with sledgehammer cinema tactics. 
I am not going to see his next work.
