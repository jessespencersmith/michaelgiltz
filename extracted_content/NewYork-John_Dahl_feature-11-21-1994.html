            <p>C Noir Deadline at Dawn. No Way to Treat a Lady. 
Killer's Kiss. Film noir is a tough racket, 
and who better to stand toe-to-toe with 
the Film Forum retrospective (11118-1112) 
than director John Dahl? He's given a criti­
cally acclaimed jolt to the genre with Red 
Rock West (1993) and his current hit The 
Last Seduction, which features Linda 
Fiorentino as the kind of dame who 
would give even Barbara Stanwyck 
pause. "I haven't seen haH these 
movies," admits Dahl as he scans a list of the 62 
movies in the series. "I always thought the title I Wake lJp Scream­
ing 112/6 and 1217) was hilarious; I just loved the absurdity of it. I 
finally rented the movie about two years ago." How was it? "It's good. 
I hate to say this about noir, but I think a lot of times you have to go 
through a lot of them before you find one that you really like. Some of 
them don't really stand up because, remember, these were really low­
budget movies that Hollywood was putting together quite quickly. 
Sony, Wrong Number 112/6 and 1217), though, has got to be one of 
my favorite noir movies. It's got great tension and Barbara Stanwyck 
is terrific. That one really holds up to the test of time." So do the cyn­
ical edges and happily amoral attitudes of noir's most memorable 
characters, such as the sycophantic publicist played by Tony Curtis in 
Sweet Smell of Success (11118-11124), the first film in the series. 
"Most of us don't 
have that much mal­
ice in our hearts," 
says Dahl. "I think 
it's always shocking, 
the depths that pe0-
ple will go to, the 
brutality that individ­
uals will inflict. 
That's part of the 
appeal of these 
movies. For me, any­
way." MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
