6/13/2005 02:14:00 PMBush was pulled kicking and screaming into Blair's plan toprovide debt relief for Africa. But as others have pointed out,the $40 billion package amounts to about $1.5 billion less ayear in money these countries will pay. That, of course, is apittance. Blair's goal is $50 billion more a year in aid PLUSserious free trade reform (remember when Republicans likedfree trade?) that will allows African farmers to compete on theworld market by lowering the trade barriers the US and othercountries have in place.The LA Times makes this very point in its lead editorial.U.S. foreign aid in general has been pathetically small fordecades. When Bush took office, it amounted to just atenth of a percent of national income. So when Bush toutshis record — a tripling of aid to Africa, a $15-billioncommitment to fight HIV/AIDS, etc. — it has to be put inperspective: It's better than nothing, but it's still kind ofmeasly....Nobody is calling for a blank check. The Bushadministration and others are rightly trying to tie aid toeconomic reform and good governance, but some of theunmet needs in sub-Saharan Africa — vaccines, mosquitonets, schoolhouses — are so basic that they transcendpolitics. It also doesn't help these nations that the U.S. andother rich countries don't engage in fair trade for farmgoods, and the G-8 needs to recommit itself to endingthose subsidies that victimize the developing world.At best, we've taken a tentative first step in putting Africa on its owntwo feet, but Bush will be throwing that money in a hole if he doesn'ttake advantage of this opportunityThink of Africa as a critically illpatient. If you want to cure them, you need to insert a feeding tube,defeat the disease and then focus on rehab. All we've done so far isinsert the feeding tube. And that isn't enough.
