Bold: movies that have or likely will triple their reported
budgets. That's my standard for a movie being a box office hit
from theatrical alone. Many films will be profitable for a
studio even if they don't triple their reported budget, but it's
a good marker to indicate a big hit. 
ANALYSIS 
Let me make several pointed comments this week. 
NORTH AMERICAN 2024 BOX OFFICE WAS GREAT -- The North
American box office take of $8.5b for 2024 is  terrific! Anyone
suggesting it's a disappointment is crazy. Studios released 25% fewer
wide releases than was typical from 2016-2019. So we reasonably
expected 25% lower box office than was the average for those years. To
be conservative, we hoped for $8 billion. But the movies that were
released overperformed nicely and instead of a rock solid $8.3b we
scored $8.5b.  China, by the way fell 23% and only grossed $5.8b. The
reasons they're not equaling or surpassing North America as the
biggest market? An economic downturn and government interference
that's turned people from Hollywood films and made it harder to
market those films even when they're granted permission to come to
China. Further proof Hollywood should keep pushing to show their
movies in China but not bother catering in absurd or offensive ways to
its totalitarian government. 
Also, family films dominated, so the fear that families would never
return to movie-going is utterly demolished. Indeed,

year (the highest grossing R-rated film of all time, the highest grossingTHE ULTIMATE GRAMMY

<p>live action musical of all time, etc.) it's very clear audiences are more
than ready to go see movies. Hollywood just needs to make them,
release them and LEAVE THEM IN MOVIE THEATERS. 
HOLLYWOOD NEEDS MIDBUDGET AND SMALL BUDGET MOVIES
--  A mix of movies is essential. Yes, Hollywood had lots of sequels and
remakes and spin-offs. It always had them and it always will. But look
at the key role played by horror, films for adults, and by mid-budget
and low budget films.  Nosferatu was a huge gamble and paid off with
its $50mb for a horror flick based on an old silent movie most have
never heard of before. It lines up director Robert Eggers as the next
potential Guillermo Del Toro/Peter Jackson or maybe Christopher
Nolan. But we also had  Conclave and  A Complete Unknown and
Heretic and  Anora and  The Best Christmas Pageant Ever and
Babygirl. They include mid-sized and very modestly budgeted films
pitched to adults, families and a wide range of tastes. These movies are
absolutely crucial for developing talent like Eggers and keeping
theaters full. Not all of them will be hits of course. 
STUDIOS ARE WRONG ABOUT STREAMING WINDOWS -- Studios
have mostly lost their minds on streaming windows. None of them will
release actual grosses for their Premium Video on Demand. So they're
either making so much money they don't want talent to realize that
(which is the reason they treated grosses from DVD and BLuRay rental
and sales like a state secret) OR the more likely scenario that the take
isn't that impressive. They insist it isn't hurting box office. Bull. I was
about to go see a movie and saw an ad saying it was already available in
the home and it made me feel a bit of a fool for going anyway. And I'm
a definite outlier when it comes to movie-going, since I will go all the
time. 
Disney is perhaps the best about respecting windows, supporting the
crucial theatrical experience and thus squeezing out every penny of
profit at every stage. Universal is the worst. Even with a critically
acclaimed leggy hit like The Wild Robot, they rushed it to PVOD in just
18 days. They of course would argue the film's success proves it's not a
problem. But that's a remarkable word of mouth smash. And their ads
for it almost kept me from going to see it in the cinema. And doing so
teaches consumers to wait. Why bother going to a movie theater? You
can just sit on your couch and wait. 
Putting  Wicked onto PVOD when the film was still making money
worldwide is bonkers. They have the sequel coming in November. They
have Oscar nominations ahead. They have three months of little
competition. AND they could be grossing a lot more worldwide. But
Universal knows the second it's online there will be high quality
bootlegs everywhere, discouraging people from going to see it in a
theater. This film is an event and should be treated as such. One trade
said it's not as well known in the non-English speaking world. (It's a
huge hit of course in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.) Not true.
The stage musical ran for a blockbuster nine years in Japan. It saw
productions in Germany, Mexico, Amsterdam, Norway, Sweden,
Poland and so on, with a new production opening in Spain in October.
It also toured many other countries not mentioned. Plus, a mini-3/24/25, 3:05 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  5, 2025

<p>version played in theme parks around the world seen by tourists
coming from countless countries. It is a worldwide property and
treated right,  Wicked should squeeze out every penny from every
country and grow its overseas take for the sequel. Rushing it to PVOD
when it's making oodles of cash is counterproductive in every way and
a slap in the face to exhibitors. And not for nothing, but Wicked is far
more enjoyable on the big screen with an audience than seeing it at
home. 
INDIA SHOULD TOUT ITS FILMS TO THE WORLD -- India and
other countries need to learn the power of boasting about their box
office. Too often, producers in China and India and Hong Kong and
elsewhere care only about their home markets. They don't even bother
to tout the grosses of their hits to Comscore and the trades, any easy
step that brings them great press and free marketing. Why ever not?
Two cases in point.  Pushpa 2: The Rule is the top-grossing film of all
time in India, passing  Baahubili 2. (By the way, those are both Telugu
films, showing how the outdated idea of Bollywood and its Hindi
language films dominating Indian box office is long gone.) Now  Pushpa
2: The Rule  is about to challenge 2016's  Dangal to become the highest
grossing Indian film of all time worldwide. Simiarly, Hong Kong's  The
Last Dance is the highest grossing Hong Kong film of all time and has
made oodles of money in China and elsewhere. Both films should be on
the lips of anyone reading the trades but I have struggled just to get an
accurate read on their grosses week to week. Producers in these
countries  and the film industry honchos are missing out. Report your
grosses! Bang the drum for your big hits! 
Happy New Year!
NOTES 
mb = a film's budget in millions of US dollars; ww = worldwide
1. Mufasa: The Lion King– $200mb 
2. Sonic The Hedgehog 3– $120mb
3. Moana 2– Is the budget lower since it was intended for tv, at first?
Or higher because they had to rethink everything? Disney says it cost
$150mb, just like the original. You can bet Dwayne Johnson gets more
than his share of coconuts, but that won't matter with a hit like this.  
4. Nosferatu– $50mb for Robert Eggers, acclaimed director of The
Witch, The Lighthouse and The Northman. That had his biggest budget
and was not a commercial success. I saw him as more of an arthouse
guy. But backers stuck with him, gave him a big budget and a starry
cast for a remake of  Nosferatu, which I guess is classier than
remaking  Dracula but still a hard sell I thought. And on Christmas
Day? That's counter-programming I was not behind. Happily, I was
wrong and Eggers looks more like the next Peter Jackson/Guillermo
Del Toro than a guy given big budgets too fast or for the wrong
projects. Good for him! 3/24/25, 3:05 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  5, 2025

<p>5. Octopus With Broken Arms aka Wu Sha 3 (Manslaughter 3)–
Chinese drama about businessman's daughter kidnapped from his
home. 
6. Big World– $29m ww debut. Chinese drama starring pop star and
actor Jackson Yee as a young man living with cerebral palsy. Yee has
gone from boyband TFBoys to having the Mandarin song of the year in
2017 to success in TV and film. How's his English, asks Hollywood? 
7. Wicked– $150mb for each part, so $300mb total plus beaucoup
marketing. It's a big movie! 
8. Honey Money Phony–Chinese rom-com about young woman
suddenly burdened with debt who falls for a (very handsome) young
con man. Will he go straight for her or teach her his wicked ways so she
can get out from under this financial disaster? 
9. A Complete Unknown–$60mb+ for this Bob Dylan biopic? That's a
lot of money for a film about Dylan going electric at Newport. I mean, I
want to see it but then I'm a Dylan fanatic. Off to a very good start and
star Timotheé Chalamet is sure to get an Oscar nomination, so it
should keep going. But $180m worldwide seems highly unlikely to me,
if not impossible. (Do other countries give a toss about this? Is
Chalamet a big enough draw for this story? I doubt it.) I'm glad it was
made, but it was made for too much. Like Gladiator II, this will be seen
as a commercial success, but it's not. 
10. Gladiator II–$250mb for Ridley Scott sword and sandals epic. It
needs $750m worldwide for me to call it a hit from theatrical alone but
$600m would be just fine. It's got swords. It's got sandals. Does it have
legs? No, it does not. This is the sort of film that everyone thinks of as a
hit, but actually didn't deliver. The talk of  Gladiator 3 is nonsense.
Maybe many years from now they'll use the name to launch a new
franchise, but this is the end for now. 
11. Detective Conan: Crossroad in the Ancient Capitol  (2003)–
China reissue of Japanese animated franchise entry. Film had $32m
before reissue in China. I mean, they keep making them so I assume
they're profitable. 
12. Harbin–Comscore has this at $8m but the Korean box office shows
it with $15m total. It opened Dec 24, so I assume the national chart is
more accurate.  Harbin is a South Korean historical drama set in the
early 1900s about rebels fighting against the Japanese occupation of
Korea. When one rebel leader shows mercy to Japanese prisoners and
his men pay the price, he vows to redeem himself by assassinating the
first Prime Minister of Japan. So this one will probably  not have a good
run in Japan. 
13. Babygirl–$20mb for this Nicole Kidman sexy drama about a
powerful businesswoman finding her kink with a younger, dominating
man..her intern, no less! No milk was harmed in the making of this
movie. 
14. Finist. The First Warrior–a Russian fantasy film starring actor Kirill
Zaytsev as "the strongest, most agile, and handsome hero of3/24/25, 3:05 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  5, 2025
https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/01/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending.html 5/9</p>
<p>Belogorye," according to Wikipedia. Zaytsev certainly fits the bill,
though since Belogorye currently has fewer than 3000 people, that may
not be such a major claim. Russians are surely starved for homegrown
cinema; it's been a while since Russian films made the charts. But I
couldn't even find a trailer for it on YouTube. 
15. Conclave– a reported $20mb for this Vatican thriller means this is
a hit. It's at $60m and still going strong, with a boost from potential
Oscar noms. I do not see the point in putting it on PVOD and flooding
the market with bootlegs while potentially harming box office. This is
exactly the sort of film that can play and play in theaters.  
16. Kraven The Hunter–$120mb. Ouch. 
17. The Prosecutor–Chinese drama starring Donnie Yen, who uncovers
a deep conspiracy when a poor young man is framed for drug
trafficking. Not on Donnie's watch!
18. Homestead–faith-based post-apocalyptic drama from Angel
Studios. A survivalist fantasy. Based on a series of ten, poorly reviewed
novels.
19. The Firefighters–Korean drama with hot young newbie joining
firefighter squad, only to butt heads with a legendary veteran. 
20. The Fire Inside–$12mb for this indie drama about the true story of
female Olympian boxer from Flint, Michigan. It's a stellar week for
director Barry Jenkins, who wrote and produced this film and sees his
family film  Mufasa: The Lion King finding its audience. 
21. Red One–Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans action/Xmas comedy.
A budget reportedly up to $250mb. It's a theatrical failure, but that
failure would have been just as clear if it had gone straight to
streaming. Now at least it is (almost) paying for a worldwide marketing
blitz and that can only help. Remember how people rented crap movies
at Blockbuster simply because they'd "heard" of it during the theatrical
run? Same idea. 
22. Paddington in Peru–$50mb? I'm just guessing. (That's sort of
midpoint between the original and  Paddington 2.) Sadly, three times is
not the charm artistically for this once-perfect franchise.
23. The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim–per Screendollar, the
budget is $30mb for this animated prequel to  The Hobbit and  The Lord
of the Rings movies. Even at that price, it's a flop.  Taken solely from
minor footnotes in the novels, it was a gamble but a smart one. An
animated film won't be compared to Peter Jackson's masterpiece. (See:
the TV series.) And it's not retelling stories we've already heard. (See:
superhero movies that go back to the well by redoing an origin story for
Superman, Spiderman, et al.) Unfortunately, you still have to be good.
The trailer I saw disappointed and audiences are not responding. A
pity.  
24. Bogota: City of the Lost–Korean drama about immigrants in
Colombia who fall into illegal smuggling out of a desperate need to
survive. No the best tourism ad for Bogotá.3/24/25, 3:05 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  5, 2025
https://popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2025/01/worldwide-box-ofﬁce-for-w eek-ending.html 6/9</p>
<p>25. Hot Pot Artist aka Huo Guo Yi Shu Jia –A young Chinese man
dreams of becoming a film director, but somehow ends up running a
hot pot restaurant for artists, instead. 
26. 28. Pushpa 2: The Rule– $60mb. This is now reportedly the
highest grossing Indian film of all time, passing Baahubili 2!  The
Telugu language action film is also closing in on 2016's Dangal  to
maybe become the highest grossing Indian film of all time. It's a big hit,
but it's been off the worldwide charts for a few weeks now, in part
perhaps because Indian companies wrongly don't recognize the power
of marketing box office hits to promote both the movie at hand and
Indian cinema overall. We're an afterthought for an industry that
historically focused on its domestic market alone. But now Indian films
regularly debut in the Top 10 in North America. Since Pushpa 2
grossed at least $140m in India that means it's grossed a huge $70m
overseas, more than most of their movies make in total. They should be
boasting about it. I'm in London and jaws dropped when I asked some
Indian workers at Pret a Manger if they'd seen it yet. You've heard of it,
they asked? One worker called over another worker and then asked me
what I thought of it in front of her, just so she could be astonished as
well. 
First notes: The original Indian/Telugu film cost half as much and only
grossed $46m. So the sequel cost more than the original movie's total
gross.  But it  doubled the original's entire gross in its first week.
Originally, a chunk of the two films were shot at the same time, but
they did significant reshoots, so just 10% came from the first go-round.
Yes, it was the highest grossing Indian movie of 2021; yes it's the
highest grossing Telugu films of all time.  But even the lowest estimate
of the original's budget is $23mb, so it wasn't a huge hit to begin with. I
am puzzled. Are the economics different for Indian films? I wouldn't be
surprised if the calculations were different. There are no reports of the
first film being a particular hit on streaming or on demand etc, which
might justify all this. I think it's another example of Indian films
committing to a sequel before there's any demand. Indeed, this film
was cut into two parts before the first release. A number of other films
seem to be two-parters, which is a very rare thing in Hollywood but less
so in India. Is it a good idea? I don't think so.   
27. Her Story aka Hao Dong Xi -- Chinese drama, literally
translated as "Nice One." Single mom moves in with another single gal;
adventures ensue. I don't like calling film's hits without some reporting
on its budget. But I can't imagine this type of film costing even $20m,
so it's a hit!
28. I Am What I Am 2–Chinese animated film is a sequel to a 2021
animated action comedy. This time, a newcomer to Shanghai agrees to
fight in a boxing/martial arts tournament to raise money for his ailing
dad. It's a spiritual sequel to the first film, which was critically praised
but only grossed $40m ww. In that film, a kid competes in a lion
dancing competition while  his ailing dad is in a coma. 3/24/25, 3:05 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  5, 2025
