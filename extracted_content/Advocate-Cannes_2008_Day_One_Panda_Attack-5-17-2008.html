            <p>May 17, 2008Cannes Day One -- Panda Attack!I'm stacking up some of my early posts, which I had technicaldifficulty in getting up (hey, you try asking in French for WiFi at3 in the morning).Day One began with the almost traditional "stunt" of a photoshoot. Cannes is famous for stars and would-be stars anglingfor attention -- from topless actresses on the beach to moreelaborate fare like Jerry Seinfeld dressing up in a bee costumeand "flying" over the main drag the Croisette to promote "BeeMovie." This year it was Jack Black surrounded by two dozenpeople in giant panda bear suits to get attention for "Kung FuPanda." In stark contrast to this fluff, the Opening Night film"Blindness" was screening. Based on the wonderful novel byJose Saramago (if you liked Cormac McCarthy's "The Road,"you'll like Saramago's "Blindness"), it stars Julianne Moore,Mark Ruffalo, Danny Glover, and Gael Garcia Bernal. I read thebook to prepare for the film and -- in typical Cannes fashion --instead of seeing the movie I have to watch Black doroundhouses and goofing around with giant pandas whilehordes of photographers are screaming his name. Since I don'tsee the movie, I feel obliged to skip the journalist roundtablesand a chance to chat with the lovely Moore and (sigh) Bernal.Welcome to Cannes.Posted at 01:03 PM in Cannes 2008 | PermalinkTrackBackTrackBack URL for this entry:http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341ca4b653ef00e55230eb7b8833Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Cannes Day One --Panda Attack!:CommentsVisit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement
