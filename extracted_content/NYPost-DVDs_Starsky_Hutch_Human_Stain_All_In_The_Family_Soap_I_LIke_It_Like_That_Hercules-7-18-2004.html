~ Starsky & Hutch * * * 
z Warner Bros., $27.95 
Great casting, just the right tone; a cameo from the original stars 
and it's all over in 100 minutes. Just the one hilarious scene with 
Hutch on a couch with two girls he encourages to kiss makes it all 
worthwhile. Extras include the usual gag reel and deleted scenes, 
with a brief mockumentary where everyone jokes about having a 
miserable time on the set. Also out: "Starsky & Hutch: Complete 
Second Season" (Columbia TriStar, $49.95). 
The Human Stain 
** Miramax, $29.99 
You know 
something is 
up when a 
pedigreed 
film like this 
(acclaimed 
novel by Philip 
Roth, starry cast 
featuring Anthony Hopkins and 
Nicole Kidman) offers virtually 
no extras for the DVD of this 
drama about a black college 
professor who passes for white 
but is ironically accused of 
racism. No commentary track 
and the briefest of featurettes? 
This is one noble failure they 
clearly wanted to forget. 
Allin The Family: 
Third Season / Soap: 
Second Season ****/*** Columbia TriStar, $29.95 each 
What seemed shocking 20 
years ago can seem awfully 
lame today. But these two 
groundbreaking series still 
stand tall because of sterling 
writing and a desire to do more 
than just offend, ''All in the 
Family" has great characters -
including a bigot you love to 
watch make a fool of himself. 
"Soap" seems a little rickety 
now (their budgets were 
awfully low), but the budding 
cast (Billy Crystal, Robert 
-Guillaume, Katherine 
Helmond) made the most of a 
spoof Mel Brooks would have 
been proud of. 
I Like It Like That 
*** Columbia TriStar, $19.95 
Female directors still struggle, 
unfortunately. In 1994, Darnell 
Martin wrote and directed this 
gem starring Lauren Velez as a 
struggling Bronx mom. It got 
strong reviews, but she's been 
mostly helming episodes of TV 
shows like "Oz" and "ER" ever 
since. (Her upcoming TV 
movie, "Her Eyes Were 
Watching God" with Halle 
Berry, should change that.) 
Also check out "Seaside," (First 
Run, $29.95), the quiet French 
drama written and directed by 
Julie Lopez-Curval that won a 
top prize at Cannes. 
Hercules: Season Four 
**1/2 
Anchor Bay, $69.98 
Syndicated shows rarely get 
any respect. Case in point, 
"Hercules," which brought 
Greek mythology, scary 
monsters, a rare sense of 
humor and lots of manly 
posing by Kevin Sorbo to the 
small screen. Just as ignored 
but more serious fun is "La 
Femme Nikita" Second Season" 
(Warner Bros., $99.98).</p>
