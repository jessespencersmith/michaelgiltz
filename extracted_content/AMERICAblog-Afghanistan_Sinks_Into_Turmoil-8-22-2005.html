8/22/2005 01:47:00 PMAfghanistan has never been a success story. Now, most of thecountry is controlled by drug lords and the Taliban. And thenews is getting worse, per the NYT.This year is already the deadliest for Americansoldiers in Afghanistan since the war of 2001, and theviolence is likely to intensify before the nation'slegislative elections on Sept. 18.One culprit? Bush's buddies Pakistan.The Afghan officials said it was increasingly clear in recentweeks that the elections were not the only target and theyaccused Pakistan, in particular, of supporting a long-termstrategy of destabilization in Afghanistan to keep thecountry weak. "Maybe they see a stable Afghanistan as athreat to themselves," the security official said.The simple truth is that Bush can't do ANYTHING right.
