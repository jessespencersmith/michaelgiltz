 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyCrime Thriller 'The Kings Of Cool' Is
Bloody Good Fun
THE KINGS OF COOL  *** out of ****
By Don Winslow
$25.00
336 pages; Simon & Schuster
With Savages , author Don Winslow  transformed
himself from an author into a franchise. Critics and fellow writers had enjoyed his playfully funny and
brutal crime novels like The Winter Of Frankie Machine  for years.
But Savages  pulled out all the stops. Winslow rolled the dice on every level with sexy, smart characters;
short, sharp, shocked chapters; dips into the screenplay form (because everyone thinks in terms ofmovies now); and even goofing around with punctuation and spacing, letting a thoughtslide down a pageuntil it hit the punchline.
Get it? Stephen King compared it to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  (see, a movie!) and no wonder.
The story centered on two guys and a girl: Ben, Chon and Ophelia, aka O. Ben is a super-smart liberal,
Chon an ex-military conservative, O a child of privilege and they're all living the high life. Literally.
Ben and Chon serve up primo marijuana in as many flavors as Ben & Jerry's, with Ben doing social work
in Third World countries on the side for his karma and Chon always ready to dish out violence becauseturning the other cheek gets old fast in the drug trade. In Savages , they found themselves facing off
against a Mexican cartel that not only wanted their turf but insisted the lads come work for them. Itskittered to a memorable finale, and if the Oliver Stone movie is half as jazzed up on their sexy fatalism,it could be a blast and bring Winslow even more fans.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>They would do well to start with this prequel, The Kings Of Cool,  before reading Savages  or seeing the
movie. It has all the snap and savvy of Savages  but with even more ambition and heart. Here we get the
origin story of Ben and Chon and O, along with flashbacks to the '60s for the origin story of the drug
trade in California. As is only hinted at in Savages , this involves their parents to a surprising degree.
Surfers, free love, messed up parenting, communes, therapy and more all combine to propel first theparents and then the children into drug dealing. Winslow also artfully shows how the game changes alongwith the drugs: the mellowness of pot slides into the trippy-ness of acid which burns into the stinging
nastiness of cocaine. The money gets bigger, the stakes get higher and the violence turns from an off-
screen flirtation into a live-in lover.
Savages  was fun but The Kings of Cool  has more emotional weight. Parents betray -- or, worse, simply
fail -- their children. Children must decide whether their loyalty lies with biology or those they've bonded
with. And the multi-generational arc of the story (we go back and forth in time throughout) showsWinslow's ambitions have risen along with his success. From watching Ben seduce a federal agent intobecoming his paid informant to watching O literally seduce first one and then the other dude of herdreams, we are entranced.
Winslow even humanizes a beautiful gold-digger named Kim, showing the drive and determination it
takes to leap from dismal trailer park to dissatisfied trophy wife. Winslow himself has probably justpulled off the same trick: graduating from well-reviewed writer to a name brand author who delivers thegoods. Let's hope they don't share the same fate because in Winslow's world, ambition -- even ambitionspiked with good intentions -- almost always proves fatal.

Winslow brings the Southern California surfing culture to vivid life & creates memorable characters
who do not always behave in a predictable fashion-definitely a talent to watch.

Have not read a good thriller book in a long time now. This seems like a good one, will get it.

Great. Hope you enjoy it; definitely a quick, violent, stylistically accessible but playful
summer read.
