They're a great rock band that also happens to put ondelightful theatrical shows. Or they're a great theatrical troupe that also happens to release terrific albums. Takeyour pick.The guys met at Carnegie Mellon and formed their troupe in 2007. Since then, they've been crafting unique andwonderful shows built around folk tales, puppetry of all sorts, great songs and their skill as actors. They play withimagination and flair to create an entire world on stage with the simplest of tools, like a mop head, a milk jug anda bolt of blue cloth. The guys usually play multiple roles in every show, trade off lead vocals and generally havea blast.Seven years on and they're just hitting their stride. Their debut album Bremen was one of the best of 2012. Andthey've toured the country both as a rock band and with their show The Old Man and The Old Moon. I reviewedit when the show debuted here and it was a delight to see it again because it revealed another skill of this group:they know how to get better. It's very hard to have perspective with your own work, especially after you'veshared it with the world.But PigPen has edited and tweaked and simply grown more confident in their skills. And now this newlytightened and trimmed show is yare, as only the best sailing vessels you've grown comfortable with can be.They've eliminated the intermission, focused the storytelling in ways large and small and made a very goodshow even better. If you saw it before, you'll want to see it again. If you haven't, now's the time.Here's a video of the song "Bremen," which is a highlight of the show and the title track on their debut CD. It'snot footage from the show, but the playful puppetry on display gives an idea of their sensibility and the visuallook of the show.The story is an original folk tale, in this case one that explains why the moon waxes and wanes. Turns out itdidn't always do so, thanks to an old man who lived on a cliff near the moon. Every day the moon leaked a bit ofliquid light, the old man caught it in a bucket and topped off the celestial orb every night so its brightness wouldnever dim. But the old man's wife grew bored with their unchanging routine and his unwillingness to head totown or spend even a day away from his charge. So she took off in a boat, he took off after her and there hangsa tale.It begins simply with the men on stage playing instruments, jamming casually with one another and then slowlyslipping into a full-bodied number as a little boy near me wondered, "Has it started?" Yes it has. The story is fullof pirates, sea creatures, mythical cities on the horizon, fabled sailors, simple bravery (which is never thatsimple), lies that help, truth that hurts, balloonists and much more. It's rousing, silly, sweet and bursting withgood songs, ranging from folk ballads to one awesome Tom Waits-like number that feels like an electric jolt tothe evening.</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=6d36e7ad-27dc-4d84-a8cc-c16487bdf6b0&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&2/4I haven't singled out any of the PigPen members, because they truly feel like such an ensemble. Oh sure, you'llhave your favorites. But as each member dives into a new role, as three or four of them playfully jump togetherand declare they're a ship! and you think, yes of course, a ship! and they move little cut-out characters behind alit-up scrim to illustrate a character walking on a journey, you'll laugh with each and every one of them at somepoint. And as they raise their voices in song, you'll think this or that fellow has an especially lovely voice butalways, always they sound better, stronger and more special when their voices join in unison.Prior to this production, I'd seen them in funky venues in Brooklyn or Off Broadway settings. Now here they areat the New Victory Theater, a jewel box of a house that is devoted to fare for family audiences. As anyone who'shad the pleasure to see a show at New Victory, it's a great space and their best shows would appeal to anyone.That's certainly true of this show, which runs through October 13.But just because kids can have fun, don't confuse this with a children's show that adults can enjoy too. (Not thatthere's anything wrong with that.) You might say the same of the Tony-winning show Peter and the Starcatcher,which had a similarly playful tone. The Old Man and the Old Moon makes perfect sense here, but it would alsofit right in at the high art stages of the Brooklyn Academy of Music or with an open run on Broadway. The onlything that doesn't make sense is missing these talented performers in action.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical ***Rodney King *** Hard Times ** 1/2 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead ** I Could Say More * The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner ** Machinal *** Outside Mullingar *** A Man's A Man * 1/2 The Tribute Artist ** 1/2 Transport ** Prince Igor at the Met ** The Bridges Of Madison County ** 1/2 Kung Fu (at Signature) ** Stage Kiss *** Satchmo At The Waldorf ***  Antony and Cleopatra at the Public ** All The Way ** 1/2 The Open House (Will Eno at Signature) ** 1/2 Wozzeck (at Met w Deborah Voigt and Thomas Hampson and Simon O'Neill) Hand To God *** Tales From Red Vienna ** Appropriate (at Signature) * Rocky * 1/2 Aladdin *** Mothers And Sons ** Les Miserables *** 1/2 Breathing Time * 1/2 Cirque Du Soleil's Amaluna * 1/2 Heathers The Musical * 1/2</p>
