Like The New'Yorker at 
its best" two .new spin­
off collections '­
Wonderful Town:' New 
'ork-Stories from The New 
'orker" and "Life Stories: 
'rofiles' from· The New 
'orker" -. have a certain 
imelessness: You could dip 
1W them tomorrow or 20 
ears from tomorrow and 
le pieces you'd r~ad would 
e every bit as fascinating. 
"Wonderful Town" 
)Bects fiction from the 
1St 50 years by the likes of 
ladimir Nabokov and 
hi lip Roth, all of which 
'e set wholly or in part in 
ew York-.City. "Life 
:ories" offers profiles of 
Ie famous and obscure, 
mging from. Marlon ,Brando in his prime to 
Richard Pryor in his sad, 
slow decline. 
Reigning New Yorker 
editor David Remnick · 
offers brief, modest intro-
. ductions that basically 
explain why certain pieces 
were excluded . (According 
to Remnick, Tom Wolfe's 
New York-set stories 
weren't up to snuff, while a' . 
number of classic profiles 
such as Joseph 
Mitchell's novella-length 
"Joe Gould's Secret," the 
basis of an upcoming 
Stanley Tucci film -were 
too lengthy for·inclusion.) 
Contrary to some 
people's belief, says 
Remnick, founding editor 
Harold Ross did not invent· the profile. Plutarch 
and The Saturday 
Evening Post beat 
him to it -but Ross' 
New Yorker, 
contends Remnick, 
perfected it. 
. As far as fiction is 
concerned, no one 
would dispute the 
magazine 's one-time 
preeminence. For a 
writer in the '50s and 
'60s, getting a story 
published in The New 
Yorker was like a 
stand-up comic getting 
a slot on "The Tonight 
Show." The names 
included here reflect 
that: John Cheever, 
Ann Beattie, J.D. 
Salinger and Susan 
Sontag among them._. 
Most of these stories are 
well-known , like Woody L t F E

()O~S ,:? .'( up against . _ .Donald 
. Barthel~e's ' :., " playful" 
modernism, for example­
-the fact that these 
stories are so familiar'ana 
widely .available undercut 
the collection's claim' to 
distinction . 
. Far better is "Life 
Stories." While the short 
stories range all over the 
magazin~'s history, with 10 
stories from the '40s, nine 
'from the '80s and a batch 
from ': ." other . decades, 
the 'pieces' are heavily 
. weighted toward· the '90s, 
whi~h Remnick contends 
are the'glory days of The. 
New Yorker. 
Whether ' or not that 
Alien's "The Whore of for a fee. And while the claim is true, the sketches 
Mensa," that hilarious gem stories are juxtaposed as that are· -included . -are 
.about men who get their imaginatively possible -terrific: from Kenneth 
kicks from women who Peter Taylor's old- 's fas'cinating 
discourse on Goethe, say, fashioned prose b /!t Johnny Carson 
~~------ ------------</p>
<p>to Wolcott Gibbs' famous 
decimation of Time's Henry 
Luce. 
The collection begins, 
appropriately enough, with 
one of the best pieces by a 
master of the character 
sketch, Joseph Mitchell's 
"Mr. Hunter's Grave." It 
ends with Janet Malcolm's 
look at the artist David 
Salle and offers detours 
along the way to Ernest 
Hemingway , Mikhail 
Baryshnikov and a 
charming imposter -who 
claimed to be a Russian 
prince named Michael 
Alexandrovitch Dmitry 
Obolensky Romanoff . 
Unlike the short stories, 
many of these pieces are 
difficult if not impossible to 
find in other compilations . 
Where else could you read 
Mark Singer's playful look 
at the sleight-of-hand 
master Ricky Jay or Susan 
Orlean's delightful riff on 
the show dog Biff? 
On their own, the stories 
in "Wonderful Town" have 
already stood the test of 
time. "Life Stories" -the 
more necessary of these 
collections - will certainly 
do the same.</p>
