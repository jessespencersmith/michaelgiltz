            <p>F R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 3 ,  2 0 0 7Overnight TV Ratings -- Goodbye "OC""Grey's Anatomy" clearly was NOT hurt by the brouhaha over thebigoted comments of one cast member. The show has now definitelysolidified its lead over "CSI." "My Name Is Earl" and "The Office" wereboth especially good last night. Oprah's first Oscar special won the 10p.m. slot. And oh how I teared up for the finale of "The OC." I was avery faithful watcher in season one, but drifted away by the end ofseason two. So here I was watching people reunite when I had no ideawho they were. SPOILER ALERT. I saw the Cohens invade the home ofa gay couple in Berkeley. They gave up their home and sold it to themonce it became clear that this was where the Cohens belonged --besides, gay men don't have REAL lives, so how could they feel anattachment to their home? By the way, one of them proved to be amidwife while the other was a wedding planner. At least the showmeant that to be funny instead of a given. At the very end, Ryanwandered through their empty OC mansion, in a clear echo of the finaleof "Upstairs, Downstairs" complete with echoing voices from the pastand glimpses of early episodes. Boy, nothing dates faster than theappearance of a soap star -- Benjamin McKenzie was only wearing at-shirt in glimpses from the pilot, but somehow that looked out of styletoo. We see that Seth and Summer ultimately do get married and in avery silly finale, Ryan years later is leaving a construction site, sees atroubled but handsome kid on a bike who looks lost, remembers howhe was taken in by the Cohens and asks the kid if he needs any help. Ithought the kid -- who might just have been waiting for his friends -----might say, "Get away from me, you perv," but in fact he really wastroubled but good-looking, just like Ryan. (Does anyone ever rescue thetroubled but fat kids?) Ah, the circle of life. For a complete ratingsbreakdown, go to MediaWeek's Marc Berman.8 p.m.1. American Idol -- 24.18 million viewers2.
