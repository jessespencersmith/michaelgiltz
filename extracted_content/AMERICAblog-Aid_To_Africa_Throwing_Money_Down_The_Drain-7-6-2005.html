7/06/2005 01:30:00 PMA fair, tough-minded article in the NYT that looks at therampant corruption infecting many African countries. We canargue for days about the root causes, but the simple fact isthat corruption is a real problem when tackling the dire povertyand disease of the continent. It's one reason, I think, John wasarguing that it's too simple-minded to say that all the currentblame for the sorry state of that region is on the heads of theWestern powers. But even Bush says about 7 countries meethis strict standards for nations that are on firm enough footingto ensure aid isn't wasted and another six are close. And wecould funnel aid to international health orgs to try and help theother countries that don't qualify.A few more points. Here's an Independent story from the UKabout Mozambique, one nation that is a nascent success story.And here's an inspiring NYT interview with Paul Farmer, whohas been fighting to get decent health care to third worldcountries. Finally, how come the far right never complainswhen the US throws money at corrupt monarchies and militarydictatorships like the oil rich Saudis or Pakistan, but the minuteyou try to feed starving children in Africa they get in a latherover how THOSE countries are corrupt?
