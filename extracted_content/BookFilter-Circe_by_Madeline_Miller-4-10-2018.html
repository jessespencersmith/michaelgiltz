From the Publisher: The daring, dazzling and highly anticipated follow-up
to the New York Times  bestseller The Song of Achilles
 One of the Most Anticipated Books of 2018"An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-nightpage turner." - Ann Patchett In the house of Helios, god of the sun and
mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--
not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother.Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that shedoes possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivalsinto monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes
her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild
beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all ofmythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus,the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger,
too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath
of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of themost terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she lovesmost, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all,whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she
has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing
language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an
intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as wellas a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.

<p>OK, so clearly "The Song Of Achilles" was no fluke. Classicist Madeline Miller made a remarkable fiction debut with a story
plucked from "The Iliad" by bringing to life the passion and pain of the hero Achilles. Published as a paperback release, it
was critically acclaimed and became an international bestseller. Six years later, Miller returns with a story drawn from "The
Odyssey." This time she inhabits the character of Circe. As Homer told it, Circe was a near immortal banished to an island,just one of many dangers faced down by the wily Odysseus. Circe turned his men into swine but Odysseus was forewarnedby the god Hermes. The wayward warrior pressures the hag into restoring his men and then w(h)iles away a year on herisland before moving on. Some other ancient tales say Circe even bore the warrior a son (or sons) who would later
accidentally kill him. While it's true the adventures of Odysseus were peripatetic in the extreme, why exactly did he tally
for a year on her island? And how did Circe end up banished to this spit of land in the first place? As with "The Song OfAchilles," Miller brings Circe fully to life, from an anxious childhood to the endless heartbreak, disappointment andfrustrated ambition that is surely the lot of demigods who live for thousands of years. "Circe" is gripping from start to finish.
Despite portraying characters who have been indelibly brought to life so many times before, Miller's take on everyone from
Helios to Hermes to Daedalus and Circe herself threatens to overwhelm our previous imaginings. Circe's resistance to beingpigeonholed or dismissed by her father, her embrace of "feminine" pursuits looked down on by others (like weaving andwitchcraft) and so much more make this a rich tale on many levels. Above all, it's a thoroughly satisfying story. Only thegods know what epic or ancient myth Miller might set her considerable skills to next. Whatever it is, the story will surely
be worth the wait. -- Michael Giltz

"Miller follows her impressive debut ( The Song of Achilles ) with a spirited novel about Circe's evolution from
insignificant nymph to formidable witch best known for turning Odysseus's sailors into swine.... Weaving together
Homer's tale with other sources, Miller crafts a classic story of female empowerment. She paints anuncompromising portrait of a superheroine who learns to wield divine power while coming to understand what itmeans to be mortal."â Publishers Weekly, Starred Review - 
"In her stirring follow-up to the Orange Prize-winning The Song of Achilles  (2011), Miller beautifully voices the
experiences of the legendary sorceress Circe...This immersive blend of literary fiction and mythological fantasydemonstrates that the Greek myths are still very relevant today."â Booklist  - 
"A retelling of ancient Greek lore gives exhilarating voice to a witch... [Circe is] a sly, petulant, and finallycommanding voice that narrates the entirety of Miller's dazzling second novel....Readers will relish following thepuzzle of this unpromising daughter of the sun god Helios and his wife, Perse, who had negligible use for theirchild....Expect Miller's readership to mushroom like one of Circe's spells. Miller makes Homer pertinent to
women facing 21st-century monsters."â Kirkus, Starred Review  - 
"An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-night page turner."â Ann Patchett, author of
Commonwealth
- 
"With lyric beauty of language and melancholy evocative of Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn", CIRCE asks all the big
questions of existence while framing them in the life story of the famous goddess who had the magic oftransformations. A veritable Who's Who of the gods of Olympus and the heroes of ancient Greece, Circe knowsthem all and we see them through her perceptive eyes. This is as close as you will ever come to entering the
world of mythology as a participant. Stunning, touching, and unique."â Margaret George, author of The
Confessions of Young Nero
- 
"Circe bears its own transformative magic, a power enabled by Miller's keen eye for beauty, adventure, and
reinvention. Through the charms of a misfit heroine, the world of gods becomes stunningly alive, and the worldof our own humanity--its questions, loves, and bonds--is illuminated. This book is an immense gift to anyone whoreads to find their own bravery and quest."â  Affinity Konar, author of Mischling  - 
"Madeline Miller, master storyteller, conjures Circe glowing and alive - and makes the Gods, nymphs and heroesof ancient Greece walk forth in all their armored splendor.

Before the War  and Major Pettigrew's Last Stand

Odyssey by humanizing her into an empathetic, warm, multi-faceted goddess."â Vox Magazine -

reaching for Edith Hamilton's Mythology."â Library Journal -
