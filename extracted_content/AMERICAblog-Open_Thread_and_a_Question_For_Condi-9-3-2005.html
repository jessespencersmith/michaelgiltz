9/03/2005 07:15:00 PMCondi, Did you enjoy "Spamalot" while your home state ofAlabama was battered and bruised? And exactly how much didthose shoes cost that you bought at Ferragamo while peoplewere dying during the worst natural disaster in our nation'shistory? Can we see the shoes? And given how obscenelyexpensive they were, how much money have you personallydonated to the relief effort?
