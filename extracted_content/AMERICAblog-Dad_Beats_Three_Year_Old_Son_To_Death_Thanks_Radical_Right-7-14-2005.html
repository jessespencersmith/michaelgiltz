7/14/2005 01:42:00 PMWell, the radical right hate groups must be very proud. Theypreach hate and tell parents they should be ashamed anddespise their gay kids and they tell kids of gay parents to beashamed of and despise them.Their message of hate is getting out: a Florida man is going ontrial for beating to death his three year old son. He feared thelittle toddler was gay and insisted on "teaching" the boy to boxby slapping it on the head repeatedly until the poor childvomited or peed himself. Ultimately, the child fell into a comaand died. (Thanks to threader Ms. Julien in Miami for pointingus to this.)That's what happens when you demonize human beings anddestroy families by ewncouraging parents to turn against theirchildren.
