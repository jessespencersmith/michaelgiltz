8/20/2004 06:06:00 AMIt's all well and good that this group of Vietnam Vets is being taken totask. Unfortunately, John Kerry is not the one who should have to doit. Attacking those guys credibility isn't hard, given their retraction ofsworn statements, military records that contradict their claims ofthere being no enemy fire, none of them serving on a boat withKerry, commanding officers claiming today he was terrible but givinghim glowing reviews at the time and on and on.This sort of dirty work should be done by surrogates, not by Kerry.But Kerry was losing ground with veterans (he and Bush were neckand neck after the DNC and now Bush has an 18 point lead in thisgroup) and he's decided he has to directly address the campaign.Some say he waited too long. It's the old Clinton rule: immediatelyattack back on any negative ads. You're just "responding," not beingnegative; so no one can accuse you of slinging mud. And lettingnegative charges linger is always bad.
