Ah well. I mention it onlybecause lately I've been catching lazy media outlets that repeat crazy,over-the-top record sale claims without any justification. But now theBBC has gone in the opposite direction. In a piece describing hercurrent tour, they say Streisand has sold some 70 million "records"worldwide. Now, "records" is the term music pr people use when theywant to conflate album sales and single sales, when obviously selling a$15 CD is much more significant than selling a $1 single at iTunes. ButStreisand has done much better than that. She's sold 70 millionalbums...IN THE US ALONE. She's also had 44 singles chart on theHot 100, selling at LEAST 10 million copies of them (she's been a muchbigger force on the Adult Contemporary Chart for the past 25 years).Worldwide, I'd have to assume she's sold at least 100 million albums.Include singles sales and you can safely guess Streisand has sold 140million "records" -- and perhaps a lot more.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
