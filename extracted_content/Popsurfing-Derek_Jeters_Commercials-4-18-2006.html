            <p>T U E S D AY,  A P R I L  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6Derek Jeter's CommercialsI rarely see commercials anymore, thanks to the power of DVRs. Butwatching the Yankee games (and having to spot one or two more whilefast-forwarding), I've been paying attention to a series of ads starringDerek Jeter. Not all of them are new, but they are all bad. In the newone, Derek Jeter's drive for success is compared to Ford's drive tocreate great trucks. There's nothing "wrong" with the ad, it's just editedpoorly. But the really bad ad is a satire of MTV's "Cribs." Derek isshown giving a tour of his house and then says he's going to take us towhere the action is (the invariable line when a rapper shows us hisbedroom). Derek takes us to his "garage," which is an airplane hangarof massive proportions filled with literally dozens and dozens of cars.Two sleazy stripper-types are washing one of the cars and coo "Hi,Derek!" And it finishes with him saying he's got his cars, now you getyours. What were his people thinking? Derek linking himself withslutty groupies? Derek emphasizing his massive wealth and indulgingin a grotesque orgy of car buying? What a terrible stain on his image.Derek should fire his advisers. (And hire me.)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
