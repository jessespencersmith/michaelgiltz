Philip Glass is so prolific he could be considered the Joyce Carol Oates 
of the avant-garde. He's just written his second symphony and had 
a new string quartet recorded by the Kronos Quartet, and in addition 
to that is preparing a ballet for La Scala, a theater piece with director Robert 
Wilson (without actors), and a third film with director Godfrey Reggio (Koy­
aanisqatsi, Powaaqafsll. Then there's his latest work, a theater piece incor­
porating Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, which makes its American 
debut at BAM December 7. Beauty is performed with the Philip Glass Ensem­
ble and four soloists in front of a projection of the entire film, presented 
without any cuts or alterations but with the sound turned off. 
Glass often works in threes (the three films with Reggio and the three por­
trait operas--most notably Ein­
stein on the Beach), and Beauty 
is no different. "I got the idea to 
base operas on films the way they 
used to be based on novels or 
plays," he explains. "I started 
with Orphee, which we did last 
year at BAM. That was really a 
straight opera with the libreHo 
based on the film's scenario. In 
this case, I took it a step further 
by using the image itseH. After 
about ten minutes, you get the 
hang of how to look at it. You end 
up with two characters, the live­
performance character and the 
film character, and you begin to see it as one character played by two per­
sons." The final work in this particular trilogy will be an adaptation of 
Cocteau's Les Enfants Terribles, yet another aHempt to incorporate film 
into live performance art. "I'm collaborating with [choreographer] Susan 
Marshall," he says. "It will be opera, dance, and theater." While Beautyand 
Orphee originally featured scores by GeOrges Auric, Les Enfants used music 
by Bach and YlValdi. Did usurping such heavyweights give Glass pause? 
"You mean is that more scary?" he asks, laughing. "Well, I'm thinking of 
tackling the problem head-on. One of the pieces, as you might remember, 
is a concerto for three harpischords, and I'm thinking of writing a concer­
to for three pianos. I'm undaunted. At least I don't have the problem of 
dealing with a composer who has an estate and a widow and all that."
