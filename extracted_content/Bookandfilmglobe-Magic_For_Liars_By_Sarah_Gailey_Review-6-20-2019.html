FICTION  
Murder at the Magic School </p>
<p>In ‘Magic For Liars,” a Private Eye Who’s Not a Dick
 June 20, 2019  Michael Giltz
Sarah Gailey  is far from the first author to cross-pollinate fantasy with the hardboiled detective genre, as Harry
Dresden fans would surely point out. But in her new novel, Magic For Liars , she tosses in a “school for
magicians” setting and a female P.I., and suddenly she’s casting a unique spell. Philip Marlowe threw down
drinks, but he rarely broke down in tears.
Ivy Gamble, Gailey’s protagonist, is a mess. She spends her days chasing after adulterers and other sordidcharacters. If a spouse isn’t furious over their cheating partner, they’re swearing at Gamble because she’s tellingthem their partner isn’t  cheating on them. The work is easy but dirty and Gamble knows she should strive for
more.
And suddenly “more” shows up in the guise of a new client. Marion Torres is the headmaster of Osthorne
Academy of Young Mages. One of her teachers was murdered. Yes, the official investigators ruled it anaccident but Torres knows it was murder and wants Gamble to investigate.
Gamble’s sister is magical and teaches at the school. But the two haven’t spoken in years, since their mother
died of cancer. Gamble hates herself for resenting her sister and the opportunities magic opened for her. Howcan a “normal” person investigate a school filled with teachers and students who can manipulate, confuse,bedazzle and trick in a thousand different ways she’d never know?</p>

← We Got a Great Big ConvoyWell, Gamble is about to find out. Even for a private
investigator of the noir sort, Gamble has all sorts ofissues: resentment over her sister, an inferiority complexfor not being magic, alcoholism (naturally), and no lovelife or even friends (ditto). This one case could solve itall…or make things much worse.
If you’ve read Raymond Chandler, you’ll plop for much
worse. But Chandler rarely talked about periods or birthcontrol. Those matter-of-fact details are just some of thepositives in Gailey’s book. It has a few interesting men ontap, from a disgruntled teen boy certain he’s the ChosenOne to a lascivious teacher named Toff and a rather nicer
teacher named Rahul.
But it’s the women who intrigue, from Gamble’s sister Tabitha to the frighteningly persuasive mean girl
Alexandria (don’t call her Alex) to the intriguing assistant to the principal Mrs. Webb, who seems more capableand intimidating than everyone else combined. Toss in a plot that involves abortion, and you’ve got a world thatfeels more up-to-date than Lev Grossman’s The Magicians, which began and ended with the idea that it wouldbe funny if the kids in Harry Potter swore and wanted to have sex.
Gailey allows a glimmer of hope, yet holds fast to the cynical aura of true noir with conviction. That’s
admirable and makes up for a plot contrivance or two at the finale. Perhaps the only surprise is that Gaileydidn’t subtitle Magic For Liars “An Ivy Gamble Mystery” or “A Mystery For Mages” or some other clue thatthis is the launch of a series. But we figured that one out on our own.
