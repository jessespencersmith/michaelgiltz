-d * W {DOL JEG-lle 
boys don't cry 
edged it," she admits. Though she and 
Swank were the only two to get a nod 
for the film, Sevigny counts their nomi­
nations as recognition for director­
cowriter Kimberly Peirce: "Us getting 
nominated is Kimberly getting nominat­
ed because she's speaking through us." 
Like everyone else connected with 
Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny has seen how 
powerfully and personally people re­
spond to !he movie. "So many people, 
it's unbelievable," she says when asked 
if people come up to her to talk about 
it. "Especially in Hollywood-I think lives. "I've experienced that with Kids, 
too," she says. "The first time anybody 
ever approached me was a young gay 
boy who'd been infected with HIV, and 
he was crying and hugging me on the 
street. I was so overwhelmed by that. ' 
Since then she's delivered strong 
performances in Trees Lounge, The 
Last Days of Disco, and A Map of the 
World, among other films. And from 
the very start of her career she's been 
following the attempts to tell Brandon 
Teena's story. "I lmew if anybody ever 
made it into a movie, it would be

"Her love for him was so strong. It was 
unconditional, once she got over her 
denial. I think it was the first time she 
was in love, and it didn't matter to her 
whether he was a boyar girl" 
people are more apt to approach ac­
tors there. And here in Germany too 
because the movie was just released 
here. Everywhere I turn, people come 
up and say what a beautiful story they 
thought it was and how happy they are 
it was made." 
It's also a sweet reward for Sevigny, 
who has emphatically not been chasing 
success in the Hollywood mode. She 
chose to make her film debut in 1995's 
tough, controversial Kids. Playing an 
HIV-positive teen searching for the boy 
who infected her, she established her­
self right away as an actor with a talent 
for conveying hard realities. And long 
before Boys Don't Cry, she learned how 
deeply film performances can affect real something very special," she says. 
During the years it took Peirce to 
bring Boys Don't Cry to the screen, the 
emergence of the documentary feature 
The Brandon Teena Story [see page 
49J-and of competing narrative pro­
jects, including a high-profile version 
that was to star Drew Barrymore­
might have shaken Sevigny's faith that 
Boys would succeed. But she stood by 
the project the same way she feels Lana 
stood by Brandon. 
"Her love for him was so strong, ' says 
Sevigny. "It was unconditional, once she 
got over her denial. I think it was the 
first time she was in love, and it didn't 
matter to her whether he was a boy or 
girl. He was just so inspiring to her. Brandon was the first person to encour­
age her to get out of town and say posi­
tive things about her." 
Now everyone is saying positive 
things about Sevigny. Doing nonstop 
press for the European premiere of 
American Psycho, in which she costars, 
the 24-year-old actress hasn't even had a 
chance to celebrate, much less contem­
plate the sudden leap forward her career 
has taken. "No, it hasn't really sunk in 
yet at all," Sevigny says of her Best Sup­
porting Actress nomination . I don't think 
it will until I get to the red carpet on the 
evening of" 
Actually, the reality may sink in a lot 
sooner. Getting a nomination means en­
during a constant barrage of press inter­
views, glad-handing, and pressure--just 
the sort of thing the New York-based 
Sevigny (who lives in Connecticut, just 
outside the city) has always avoided. 
"It's a little intense," she says, adding 
in a whisper, "I have to be positive in 
the press about it or else Kimberly will 
get mad at me." She laughs, quickly 
making it clear she's happy about the 
hoopla around a movie and a character 
she loves. 
Still, it is intense. "They want you to 
do this whole campaigning thing," Sevi­
gny says, "going on talk shows and 
morning shows. I don't like to see actors 
I admire on talk shows. It sort of ruins 
the mystique for me. Sean Penn talking 
about Bukowski on Charlie Rose makes 
me kind of 'Uh-h-h .. .' Everybody says 
you have to take advantage of this op­
portunity; it's the opportunity of a life­
time. So I'm going to have to swallow 
my pride a little." 
Having starred as a traditionally femi­
nine woman in Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny 
crosses to the other side of the queer 
spectrum this month in a segment of 
HBO's If These Walls Could Talk 2, a 
trilogy of shorts about lesbian lives. In a 
white T-shirt with short hair slicked 
back, Sevigny romances Michelle 
Williams of Dawson's Creek. Always 
critical of her own work and leery of 
seeing the finished project, Sevigny 
laughingly agonizes over her lesbian 
fans' reactions. nOh, God," she says. "I 
try to playa butch. I'm so scared they're 
all going to turn on me and hate me for a 
bad representation." She needn't worry. 
Just as she did with Lana, Sevigny gets 
the shyness-and the sexuality-just 
right. -Michael Giltz</p>

aware, then we're probably not doing something right." 
Swank's career has been set on fire by Boys Don't 
Cry. The blaze of critical acclaim began in the fall, con­
tinued through a near-sweep of year-end critics' prizes, 
and culminated in a Golden Globe win; now she's the 
front-runner for the Best Actress Academy Award. But 
it's the attention Swank has received from ordinary peo­
ple that means the most to her. 
'This movie spoke 
to [transgendered 
youth] in a way that a 
movie hadn't yet. 
They finally fOlllld 
someone they could 
relate to, and that 
feels so good To 
think we as a society 
treat them differently 
or not as equals is one 
of the most tenible 
things about the 
human experience." "When people stop me, they touch me on the shoulder, 
they come up really close to me and look into my eyes 
very intimately, and they feel like they know me," says 
the 25-year-old, sitting in her New York City apartment 
snuggling with her pet bunny, cat, and dog as her parrot 
looks on. "They want to go into a deeper place and say, 
'This movie moved me because of this or that' or 'I have 
someone in my family who has the same situation' or 
'You know what, I'm not gay and I'm not transgendered, 
but I can totally relate to Brandon.' So I stand there and I 
have a conversation with someone I don't know for half 
an hour because we both shared the same experience. n 
Swank also found a way to share experiences with 
young people facing some of what Brandon went through. 
When a representative of New York's Hetrick-Martin Insti­
tute called and explained the organization's programs­
such as the Harvey Milk School for gay, lesbian, bisexual, 
and transgendered students, and outreach to other service 
organizations to educate them about GLBT youth-Swank 
quickly agreed to pay her own way to New York and 
emcee the institute's annual awards dinner. 
Naturally, she couldn't head to Los Angeles the next 
day without meeting the youths. "They loved her," says 
Vema Eggleston, the executive director of Hetrick-Mar­
tin, which is celebrating its 20th year. Eggleston vividly 
remembers Swank's being moved by the story of one stu­
dent having a gender-identity crisis: Biologically a girl, 
she was dressed and treated as a boy by parents for rea­
sons she never understood. In the boys' locker room, 
other students even grabbed her and held a knife to her, 
demanding to see her genitals-the same way Brandon 
was attacked. Swank was so touched by talking to all the 
youths that she changed her flight to stay longer. 
"This movie spoke to them in a way that a movie hadn't 
yet. They finally found someone they could relate to, and 
that feels so good," Swank says. "To think we as a soci­
ety ... " She struggles to convey how strongly she feels. "To 
treat [such young people) differently or not as equals is one 
of the most terrible things about the human experience." 
Wanting to do more, Swank returned to Hetrick-Mar­
tin, this time with MTV in tow, to let the rest of the coun­
try in on the work that the institute does. "They are so 
fantastic, such amazing kids," she says. "Just to see them 
and meet them and to see them growing and finding 
themselves. It's hard enough to go through life as a 
straight kid. I remember being a teenager, and they were 
such hard years. To think of all the torment I got for not 
wearing the right pants or whatever. Then to imagine 
what they go through-it's so unfair." 
It's all been an important lesson in hun1an differences, 
Swank notes. "If we were all the same, dressing the 
same, looking the same, thinking the same, the same reli­
gion, the same race-I know exactly what would happen: 
It would be so boring, so dull, it would be so bland we'd 
just pray for diversity." •
