            <p>T U E S D AY,  D E C E M B E R  1 8 ,  2 0 0 7But Where Will "The Hobbit" Part I Stop?Wonderful news that Peter Jackson will oversee "The Hobbit." If it haddragged on, Ian McKellen might have become too old to reprise his roleas Gandalf. Right now, Jackson is going to produce only, with adirector to be named (why try and top yourself?). But withpre-production beginning right away, I wouldn't be terribly surprised ifhe just couldn't resist. Filming begins in 2009 and the two moviesmade out of the book will be released in 2010 and 2011.So the question: where will they break them up? My guess is that itstops after they escape the Misty Mountains and are rescued by theGreat Eagles (who consider the hobbit and the dwarves prisoners for awhile). Gandalf then leaves them to make their way into Milkwood. (Iimagine they'll drop the scene with Beorn, the shapeshifter.) So theymake a grand escape from the goblins, hook up with Eagles and saygoodbye to Gandalf while -- gulp -- preparing to plunge into Milkwood.Makes sense to me. My next question is tone, since The Hobbit is verymuch a children's book, quite a bit simpler and old-fashionedcompared to the dark and violent Lord of the Rings.My final question: will I head off to New Zealand to write the making-ofbook?NOTE: I'm wrong. It's going to be The Hobbit as one film and then a"bridge" to LOTR based on all the material out there. I hate to questionJackson, but why craft an entirely new story to make a bridge? Is theresomething inherently thrilling in the intervening years or is he justdelighted to get to muck about more in the LOTR world? I thought youcould do plenty with "The Hobbit" on its own but of course I'll wait tohear what they have in mind.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
