4/15/2005 03:14:00 PMThis is kind of funny, actually. China at the very least implicitlyencouraged a recent wave of public demonstrations againstJapan. Unfortunately, their one billion citizens decided theyLIKED raising a ruckus in public and have planned anotherwave of protests this weekend and in May and June. Now theChinese government is freaking out. "Express your patrioticpassion in an orderly manner," is one oh so Chinese missivefrom the police.A similar wave of anti-Japan protests in the mid-80s soonblossomed into protests over the CHINESE government and ledto the ouster of the then-head of the Communist Party. As youknow, tens of millions of Chinese literally roam the countrysidelooking for work and vague reports of mass protests in outerprovinces are far from unusual. My favorite detail from theplans by organizers for this weekend's rallies: a plea for peopleto avoid bringing Japanese cameras or other electronic goods.Yes, you hate them but you love their toys.So China woke up the dragon and now, hopefully, it's turningon its jailers.
