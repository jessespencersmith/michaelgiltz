Ie ro or 
Brian Jacques hits one over the 
Redwall with 'Legend of luke' 
Long before the Harry 
Potter books became 
best-eeUera, there was 
the immensely successful 
Redwa1laeriea . 
Since 1986, burly 
Liverpool native Brian 
Jacques has been spinning 
his tale. of Redwall, a 
medieval world where 
woodland creatures like 
mice and rabbits and moles 
live together, fight off 
attack.a trom evil foxes and 
rats, and use any excuse to 
break into • song and stage 
e I.borate feuta. 
Hia latest -'"The Legend 
of Luke" -Is a rip-roaring 
adventure of pirates and 
derring-ilo. And this 12th By MICHAEL GILTZ 
installment in the series is 
bound to add to Jacques' 
popularity . Already he hosts 
his own radio show; has a 
Web site, created by a young 
fan (www.redwall.org), that 
gets about 2 miUion hits a 
year, and counts Prime 
Minister Tony Blair and his 
family among his fans. 
There's even an animated 
"Redwall" TV show - a 13-
part series that will 
probably be picked up by 
PBS -and a movie is in the 
works. 
Published in 19 countries 
and in 16 languages, the 
"Red wall" books are an 
international phenomenon . 
Here, the last two entries hit the best· seller lists. 
Since Jacques turns out 
the books like clockwork , it's 
become an annual tradition 
for him to tour the States 
for about six weeks every 
winter. It's something the 
60-year-old writer takes 
pleasure in . 
This creator of a mythical 
world says it's the United 
States he finds most 
magical. "When I was a kid 
during the back end of the 
war -when everything 
was devastation and hunger 
and rationing in our country 
-the only magic place you 
could go to was the cinema," 
Jacques recently told The 
Post. '"There you saw this wonder of 11 place called 
America where everybody 
had big cars and iceboxes 
and swimming pools." 
In the hardscrabble time of his youth, even 
imagination was rationed 
out. "I was never 
encourag ed in anything." 
claims Jacques, who says n "Everything can't be 
singing teapots, can It?" 
Jokes Brian Jacques of 
his sometimes violent 
children's books. 
teacher once caned him in 
school for turning in a short 
story that was considered 
too good. The teacher was 
convinced the boy must 
have plagiarized it. 
Jacques later dropped out 
of school at 15, joined the 
merchant marines, then 
headed back to land where 
he worked on the docks, 
drove a bus, sang in a folk 
group, did stand-up comedy, 
boxed, even read stories 
aloud to children at the 
Royal School for the Blind. 
Unhappy with the books 
that were available then, 
Jacques penned his own. A I friend took his first novel 
and -without Jacques' 
know Ilodge -showed it to a 
publisher . The Redwall 
series was off and running. 
Though good always 
triumphs over evil in 
Redwall, the dangers are 
real and the violence that 
flares up has consequence •. 
In "The Legend of Luke." 
for example, one major 
characters wife is killed, 
there's a slaughter of 
innocent people, and good 
creatures defend 
themselves by ambushing a 
group of pirates and killing 
the lot of them. "Everything 
can't be singing teapot~. 
cnn it?" jokes Jacques. 
Nor can everythi ng be 
Redwall. "I love Redwall 
and the publishers and kid~ 
want more Redwall. So I 
said I'll write one Redwall a 
vear, but I want to do other 
books, too." And the 
upcoming 'Castaways of 
'The Flying Dutchman!" 
will mark his fir.t non­
Redwall novel. 
"I wrote it la<t vear and I 
wrote it indoors: actually," 
soys Jacques, who's famous 
for spending rach summer 
in his backyard , working on 
the next Redwoll book. "I'm 
very, very ple3~d with it." 
Judging from the 
reception Accorded his 
Redwall books, "Dutchman" 
may Slli! right to the top of 
the best-seller lists.</p>
