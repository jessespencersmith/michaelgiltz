8/23/2005 10:47:00 AMThis one talks as if scientists who are religious are anembattled minority who whisper about their faith when no oneis listening.But disdain for religion is far from universal amongscientists. And today, as religious groups challengescientists in arenas as various as evolution in theclassroom, AIDS prevention and stem cell research,scientists who embrace religion are beginning to speak outabout their faith.So evolution versus creationism/ID is NOT about shoving one group'snarrow religious beliefs into public schools, as we all foolishlyassumed. It's about godless scientists versus people of faith. Besides,stem cell research is an ethical issue that all people wrestle with --even atheists. And AIDS research would have been a goodcomparison, since the far right lies about basic facts -- such as theefficacy of condoms -- that are simply not in dispute.The truth is that some of the greatest scientists in history -- Einstein,Isaac Newton -- have been people of faith. And for most majorreligions, there is no conflict between religious belief and the latestscientific findings. They might have done a serious article detailingthis but instead took the side of the IDers who want to force MYchildren to learn THEIR religious beliefs as science when it's nothingof the sort. This NYT series is getting worse and worse.
