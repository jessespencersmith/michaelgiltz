52 NOVEMBER 1996 OUT I Theories of 
Relati"ity 
Or, how actress Lisa Edelstein 
learned to kiss a girl. 
CTRESS LISA EDELSTEIN IS taking nothing 
for granted. To research her role as Rhonda 
Roth-the lesbian sister on the new ABC 
Saturday night drama Relativity (from the 
producer s of My So-Called Lifc}-Edelstein 
uses magazine articles, her friends' advice, and 
even the Internet to make certain that when 
Rhonda's with her girlfriend, it doesn't look like, "Oh, there 
are two straight girls trying to be lesbians." 
While TV land awaits an openly lesbian actress in a 
lesbian role, Edelstein's no stranger to the queer world. In 
1988, she wrote and performed in Positive Me, a stage musical 
at New York's La MaMa E.T.C. about the AIDS crisis. Her 
songs included "I Hate Condoms," "Stud Wrap," and "Where 
Is He, God?" about a boy and a girl both waiting for the right 
man. The show proved a success, and Edelstein performed bits 
of it for countless benefits during the next few years. 
Still, the night before filming a scene where Rhonda and 
her partner Sylvie (Kathryn Morris) go to the movies with 
their families, Edelstein had a panic attack. "At'I:Jo in the 
morning I realized I didn't know what it was like to have a 
public display of affection in a lesbian relationsh ip," says the 
26-year-old actress. So I called some lesbian friends of mine, 
but they were slecping and wouldn't talk to me. I went on 
America Onlinc, into the lcsbian chat room, and I thought, 
'Well, I'll just ask somebodl' here.'The most humiliating part 
of it was having to say, 'I'm an actrcss playing a lesbian'-it 
sounds so goofy. Some of the girls werc snippy, but one 
woman was rcally cool and ,Inswered my questions ." 
Even gooficr was a brief, Airt)' moment Edclstein and 
Morris filmed about what the two wom e~l would do aftcr the 
movie. "Somebod y said, .\ Vh\' don't you just ask Sylvie if shc 
wants to gct somc pie or sOlllcthing.' 1 kept saying, 'Sylvic,vou 
want to go cat some pic)'" Edelstein says drolly. "And thcn 
they said, 'Can you not s,n' "cat some pic") Bccausc somchow 
it's coming across the wrong way. .. ' 
Rhonda and Sylvie broke up in the sccond episodc, but 
Edelstein is certain Rhonda won't becolllc "the lonclv lesbian." 
Maybc her confidence comes from having her bases covered: 
Thc actress also plays Patry, the wifc ofa writcron the CBS 
sitcom Almost Perfect, and provides the voice for Mercy Grave on 
thc WB cartoon Supermal/. RllOnda's a lesbian and Patty is 
straight, so is there an)' chance that Mercy-villi;!n Lex Luthor's 
"girlfriend/assi stant/slavc" is bisexual? Edelstein laughs. "You 
know," she says, '" wouldn't be surpriscd."-M IC H 1\ F. L GIL TZ
