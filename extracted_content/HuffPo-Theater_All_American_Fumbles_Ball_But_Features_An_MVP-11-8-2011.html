 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "All-American" Fumbles
Ball But Features An MVP
ALL-AMERICAN  ** out of ****
LCT3 /THE DUKE ON 42ND STREET
All-American  is the latest production from LCT3,  the
very welcome arm of Lincoln Center that encourages the
development of new plays and playwrights. This dramaby Julia Brownell has the eye-catching premise of afemale high school quarterback named Katie Slattery
(Meredith Forlenza) feeling the pressure to succeed
from her dad Mike (C.J. Wilson), a one-time NFLsuperstar. The entire family has uprooted itself andmoved to Palo Alto, California so Katie can quarterback
for a high school team with the makings of state champs.
Mike's post-football career as a motivational speaker is
winding down so he's focused more and more on Katie. Meanwhile, his wife Beth (Rebecca Creskoff) is
more interested in her new career as a real estate agent than having more kids just because Mike is now
home and bored.
Oddly, All-American  shows relatively little interest in this female quarterback and the focus of the show
switches by default to her funny, sweet, lovably lost in the shuffle twin brother Aaron (a very appealing
Harry Zittel). He ditches pep rallies and avoids his "duty" to sit in the stands and watch football practice.Aaron would rather just fit in and maybe start dating the loner Natasha (Sarah Steele, who gets stronger
as the play goes on), who has a slutty reputation but actually seems cool and -- even better -- appears to
like him.

<p>It must be a combination of playwright Brownell having an affinity for Aaron and the excellent
performance of Zittel. But somehow or other, his dialogue is ten times funnier, sharper and more
interesting than anyone else's in the show. The parents rarely come alive as more than types, despite the
efforts of the actors involved, until a late scene during a moment of crisis when instead of spelling outtheir disagreements they simply react to what's happening and we are allowed to actually divine their
thoughts by what they do rather than have them detailed at length.
Forlenza is poorly cast. She's a lovely person but there's no getting around the fact that she looks like she
wouldn't go within ten miles of any team sport, much less football. (I felt this even before seeing the
video above.) it would be easy to say Forlenza looks more like a head cheerleader than a quarterback buteven that doesn't seem quite right since cheerleading can is a physically demanding skill, especially at the
competitive level. Forlenza's brief moments handling a ball only reinforce the idea of how ill-suited she is
for this role. Katie needn't be mannish, but surely a more physically imposing and buff actress could befound to give the character at least a modicum of believability.
None of this is Forlenza's fault, though her performance in the dramatic scenes is equally unconvincing.
Blame Brownell since for a quarterback Katie is an awfully passive character. Even when she startshanging out and apparently sleeping with her fellow teammates (a situation ripe with intriguing
possibilities), nothing comes of it that's interesting.
Brock Harris is fine in the small role of a teammate and he nails his one bit of humor with ease. The sets
by Lee Savage and lighting by Japhy Weideman (they're inextricably linked) are a highlight, with a
football field inevitably the focus of the floor, a kitchen on one side and bed/high school locker area onthe other and elegant but piercing lights on wooden frames at both ends sharply illuminating the action.Jill BC Duboff's sound design is invisible, as it should be, discretely creating the murmur and roar of
practice and games taking place out of our vision. The direction by Evan Cabnet is straightforward. But he
and the LCT3 team should have done more to workshop All-American  and find its focus by either
tackling the gimmicky topic at hand (a barrier-breaking female quarterback) or playing to its strengths
even more, namely the talented and impressive Zittel.
