            <p>S U N D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 9 ,  2 0 0 6The IRA Awards: Final ResultsAre advancing years mellowing the IRAs? No fistfights, no bitterarguments, just a desperate plea to keep things moving along becausesome people have to get up in the morning. (For the record, votinglasted from 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.) Cruel things were said, of course.Dakota Fanning's talent was battered about like a pinata. A prayer wasoffered up that Ingmar Bergman would keep his word when he saidSaraband was his final film. Sarah Silverman was praised and damned(even though Jews don't believe in damnation). And actors AlessandroNivola of Junebug, Kevin Zegers of Transamerica and Ashton Holmesof A History of Violence were manhandled like sides of beef; lovingly,mind you, but sides of beef nonetheless. Actresses who garneredsupport of the most basic sort included Maria Bello of History ofViolence, Alexis Dziena of Broken Flowers and Sibel Kekilli ofHead-On. Perhaps the overall lack of venom was due to strongappreciation for a handful of films: in no special order My Summer ofLove, Good Night and Good Luck, A History of Violence, 2046,Capote, and Tony Takitani had widespread support. But one filmdominated them all.
