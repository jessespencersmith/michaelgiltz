10/25/2004 01:16:00 PMAnother great online satire -- this one is a video of someonetrying to use an electronic voting machine to vote for Kerry.Very funny.My apologies if this was posted before; but I hadn't seen it. Isuppose every election spawns books, but this one in particularis truly a watershed. The bloggers driving the news and tearingapart shoddy reporting (hello, CBS) and forcing stories to becovered by the major media. The satirical online videos thathave both energized the bases and informed the undecideds --a truly potent force since most voters see NO political ads(unless you're in one of 11 states). The videos that mock thefew political ads we do hear about, like that wolves piece. JonStewart as a source of news. Happily, the left is clearly farmore adept at satire and online campaigns than the right.Presidential elections will never be the same.
