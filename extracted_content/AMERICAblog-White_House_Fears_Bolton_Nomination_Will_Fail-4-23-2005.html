4/23/2005 11:31:00 PMThe UN is in trouble -- thanks to the ineffectual and/or willfullycorrupt Koffi Anan -- and desperately needs reforming.Unfortunately, instead of finding a diplomat that can furtherthat agenda, the White House is trying to install a firebrandwho has proven about as undiplomatic in style as isimaginable. Now the White House admits Bolton's nominationis in serious trouble.But the criticism of Bolton is not that he's a "tough" or "mean"or even "jerky" boss. He is seriously accused by careergovernment employees and conservatives (and of courseliberals) as a serial abuser of power, a man who tried to forceintelligence employees to DISTORT their findings to further aparticular agenda (well, no wonder the White House had noproblem with that), with trying to FIRE career agents simplybecause they refused to do so and smearing anyone who got inhis way. Serious questions have also been raised about Boltonabusing intelligence information access to dig up dirt on othergovernment officials.Besides, what if the only charge against Bolton was that hephysically harassed women, chasing them down hallways andthreatening them? Maybe Dick Cheney thinks that's just beinga good boss, but most of us don't find such behavior amusingor acceptable or Christian. Why does he?
