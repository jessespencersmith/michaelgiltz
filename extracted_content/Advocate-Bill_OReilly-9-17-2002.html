(Hnr snippets from Bill O'Reilly's AdMCa/e intuview by

My Article begins here ... 
America's religious right does not 
tolerate those they believe to be 
ideologically impure, and that's why 
they're bound to be a bit upset with 
FOX TV superstar Bill O'Reilly_ 
O'Reilly is the host of "The O'Reilly 
Factor." a no-holds-barred slugfest of 
ideas that regularly lambastes 
feminists, Democrats, Ihe ACLU and 
anyone else (usually on the left) who 
ticks the lrish-Catholic O'Reilly 01T on 
a given day, Gays and lesbians are a 
particular target of the hit show, 
gelling more than their fair share of 
negative air time, and Ihafs why 
O'Reilly's upcoming interview in 
America's i the

<p>'kcr 
gay publication, bllt cvcn more 
~'UTpri~ing is whatlle tells them. (rile .... ,. from Aboo", 
interview , .... ill hit thc ncw stands on 
Septcmber 3). 
O'Reilly Pro Gay? 
According to Michael Giltz. a 
freelance rCpllMcr (and personal fricnd of mine) who conducted 
thc interview livc in O'Reilly's Manhattan office, O'Reilly not 
only ",itcl"ll1es his previolls suppon for gay adoption, bUI he 
goes on \0 call the US military "homophobic" (though he still 
thinks the gay ban is rte(;essary), says that gays should have the 
right to vi~it their same-sex spouses in the hospital (in many 
locales they cannot), thinks evcry statc should have laws 
protecting gays and lesbiMs from discrimination in the 
wori<placc (only 12 states ellrTently do), and opposes the repeal 
of a gay righ l~ oroinaru.:e in Florida's Miami-Dad e County (the 
hotly-conlcsted repeal measure is on thc ballot Septcmber 10). 
Thal"s enough right thcre to make the religious right grab for a 
Maalox. But there's more. 
On gay marriage, one ofth~ hOI-bunon religious-right issues, 
O'Reilly starts by telling Giltz lhat he opposes it. Ihen when 
pushed by the reponer, finally conced~"'$: "Look, I eouldn'l care 
less, 10 tcll YOIl the truth .. , Y 011 want 10 gCI married? Knock 
you=lf out. Go 10 Vcgas; have a good time ..• [fyou can gel 
that changed, I'm nol going to jump lip and dO\ITl and say I 
think it"swrong, because I don'\." 
Who You Calling a Fanatic? 
Thcn things get really interesting. O'Reilly calls people who 
quote the Old Testamt:ntto label gays an abominat ion "holy 
rollc,."," (a term often perceived to be pejorativc). Then he 
refCTS \0 vocal anti-gay advocates as "fanatics" ("90"-' percent 
of Americans don't care what you do; 10% arc fMatics." 
O'Reilly tells Gilt:t.. "They think you're going to hell. and they 
.... "3I1t YOllto go 10 hell. All right? Ignore them.") Whcn asked 
to clarify exaclly who he mcans by "fanatics," O'Rcilly 
responds: "I mcan, people who think you are going to hcll and 
are going to quote from Revelation that you're going there. I 
think that's a little ridiculous. don't you? Those an: the 
people."

O'Reilly Won', Name Names 
In all fairness. when ihe Admcate 
pressed O'Reilly 10 name names (for 
example. were Jerry Falwell or Pat 
Robertson "fanatics"?), he demurred . 
Nonetheless. it's difficult to avoid the 
conclusion that mem~rs of the 
religious right were among the 
fanatics and holy rollers to whom 
O'Rei Ily was referring. as they clearly 
"care what gays do" and regularly 
claim 10 be quoting the Bible in 
suggesting that gays will not be going 
to Heaven: L .... n ... Sftlppet_ 01

activist organization. issued a 
press release on October 16,

supposedly quoting the Sible as 
saying ihat "homosexuals are

• An essay on the Web site of the 
American Family Association, 
another lead anti-gay 
organization of the rar right, 
«ohoes the same sentiment 
• As does the Coral Ridge Ministries, another lead IVouP 
of anti-gay activists, 
But more important than the nuance of to whom he might be 
referring, is the fact thaI Bill O'Reilly is one of America's 
favorite right-wingers, and his TV show reportedly tops Lany 
King's in the nightly ratings, O'Reilly is a foree to be r«okoned 
with in conservative politics, and when he staru agreeing with 
gay rights advocates about the legitimacy of as peets of their 
c~usc,that's news. 
Religious Right HilS Always Been Suspicious 
Interestingly, even before deUliis of the AJvoca/c interview 
were made public, the religious right had its qualms with Bill 
O'Reilly's supposed pro-gay agenda. 
In a sUltemem recently issued 
<h' r 
"The Gay Spin 
that his show is a "no-spin zone," 
homosexual movement even 
the issue of 
into the lIomosexual's 
on site home page, the 
(CWFA) even refer to 
O'Reilly as a "conservative" between-quotcs, suggesting the 
moniker may not be correct: "Pro-homosexual media bias is 
getting SO bad," CWFA says on their Web site, "that even 
'conservatives'like FOX's Bill O'Reilly are going out of their 
way to show they are 'gay'-positivc ," 
A few days later, on August 27 of this year, the ultra­
conservative Washington Times (. newspaper owned by the 
Moonies, and with very close ties 10 the religious right) 
~I!rint~ the ponion of "The Gay Spin Zone' that atUlcks 
O'Reilly, alongside a large picture of the TV host 
(The religious right has also not been happy with the fact that 
O'Reilly will be appearing in a panel discussion at the National 
Lesbian and Gay Journalist A5SOCiation in September.) 
Ofooursc, O'Reilly's views on gay iss\ll.'S shouldn't come as a</p>
<p>complete surprise to anyone who's done their homework Gilt" 
pointed me to two paragraphs from O'Reilly's top-selling book. 
"The O'Reilly Fa<:tor." Itmt echo wh.8tlhe pundit said to the 
Advocate: 
O'Reilly on Fanatics: 
"On the other h.8nd. religious fanatics who 
demonize gays and other alternative groups arcn't 
covering themselves with glory, either. Yes. I 
know about the references to homosexuality as 'an 
abomination' in Leviticus. but I also know what 
the Old Testament says about slavery, As long as a 
sexual issue is not intruding on your freedom or 
endangering your kids.kave it to God to sort it 
OUl The Deity is a lot smarter than W<.: are. llmt's 
also in the Bible." ("The O'Reilly Factor." pJ4) 
O'Reilly on Anti_Gay Job Discriminalion: 
"And here on earth our legal system is the plllCC to 
go 50rt Oul problems such as civil rights being 
violated because of scxual preference. To someone 
gay who is the victim of diserimination or abuse. I 
say exchange the high heels for a sensible business 
suit. because that's appropriate for the playing 
field. and hire a lawyer who will put the SCreWS to 
wh.8\ever bastards are interfering with your rights 
to prh'fJte sexual expression ." ("The O'Reilly 
Factor." p.34)</p>
<p>religious right leaders questioned 
O'Reilly's Cltholicism and Slate of 
mind (you can listen to the IS-minute 
or so interview 9Illjne her( 
(RealPlayer ~ired) : 
"[To] continua lly refer 10 him5elf as a

Christian who docs not know what God's "'oro said. he does 
oot know." • Sandy Rios, President ofCWFA 
"He's confused ... on this issue. he can't find his "oice. he kind

"He's very confused." -Sandy Rios, kcad ofCWFA. on

Religioul Right Blasts O'R~illy 
Since this story about O'Reilly's Acfonoole interview was 
published, the religious right has been quick to respond. A 
kWPOkcsm l.!!. for the religious right. who is often quoted in 
their literature and broadcasts. had the following to say on</p>
<p>August 28. 2002 about Bill O'Reilly's interview that is 
discussed in the article below -!he entire paragraph was 
written by thc religious right spokesman: 
Bil[ O'Reilly has long been lined up as the COIIservauve's 
champion and spokesper$Oll_ However, in his quest of 
popularity . on this issue of homosexu ality. O'Reilly has 
shocked and disappointed many viewers and supponers who 
put him where he is today_ He has been elevated to a position 
by conserv-at;ve America that was nevcr intended. and viewers 
may have put 'too much trust' into this man, According to an 
O'Reilly insider who asked not to be named. 'The Factor' is not 
what people think it is ... "Bill O'Reilly and The Factor is about 
two things .. , ratings and entertainment" And as stated by 
another unnamed source. " ... !he real guy you're all looking for 
here is Sean Hannity. This guy is genuine -and legit" After 
the commentary below. see the link for Bill O'Reilly's 
upcoming interview in the Septembe r issue ofthe national gay 
Magazine'The Am.XXlle' -sharing all of his pro-gay views. 
and mocking comments towards Bible believing Chrisrians ­
the 'fanatical' religious right who should just be' ... ignored' -
sadly. you won't believe what he says_ 
[Note: This statemtnt has since been removed from the 
religious right Web site. "Coincidentally" !he man making the 
statement was just invited to appear on O'Reilly's show.!</p>

religious right groups rose to the duo's defense· O'Reilly let 
them have it; 
"Believe me when 1 tell you that evel)'body I

vacillating on whether her group would deal with

the interview, Knight suggests that gay rights dcf<:ndcrs are not 
very lolcranl, and O'Reilly re~ponds in kind:

The Ldt Doesn't Always Love 
Him Either 
Ironically, O'Reilly is just as suspect 
to those on the lett And the truth is, 
his show is quite onen a daily diatribe 
against the supposed evils of 
liberalism. But I've been a guest on 
the show about haIfa dozen limes. 
and got a sense of something else as 
weI!. Forall his bluster, Bill O'Reilly 
seems to be a man who lives by a 
$Olid set of con: beliefs. And when 
confronted with facts thai, when 
combined with those beliefs. lcad him 
to a conclusion Ihal might nOI please 
some of his more conservative fans. 
O'Reilly sticks to his principles and 
states his conclusion, to hell wilh the 
critics. (Over a period of eight 
months. I personally witnessed 
O'Reilly shin from being an ardent 
defender of Dr. Laura Sl:hlessinger 
and her anli-gay rhetoric, 10 somC(lne 
who later blamed Schlessinger for her 
own demise.) L ...... '0 Sn' __ of

parade near you (t!lough. reporter 
Giltz did discover that O'R~ illy was 
quite a disco dancer in his day). and 
O'Reilly himselfis the first to say that 
he's not staking out these positions 
with the express intent ofhclping gay peoplc. I also suspect 
that sometime in the ncar fiJllIre. Bill O'Reilly will again say 
something on his show that will really tick me off. 
Nonethcless. this is;) man 10 watch. 
He may be bombastic. He may yell and scream. And he may 
cvcn altimes cross the line. But he's also a nmn who listens to 
his opponents. and re~"JlCCts them if they have a good mind. a 
good heart. and can cxpress their opinion without coming ofT 
like a nut. And more importantly, if you gct him onjustlhc 
right day and with just the right facts. America's favorite 
conservative mi&ht even agree with you -cvcn ifyou'n: gay.</p>

Bill O'Reilly approves of same·sex "marriages,"

"The only hea! I take on the gay stuffis from very.

of Amerieans don't care what [homosexuals1 do Ten 
percent are fanatics. They Ihink you're going \0 hell. and 
they want you 10 go to hell." 
Mr. O'Reilly told the Advocate : "There arc millions of 
Americans who are never going 10 accepl [homosexuals]. 
primarily on religious grounds. You're never going 10 
convince the holy rollers that you're nol an abomination. 
becPuse they're going to quote Ihe Old Testament." 
Audio exeel1llS of the Advocate interview "''ere posted 
by political columnist John Aravosis on About.com.
