3/02/2005 05:54:00 PMThe Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committeedoesn't even want to check into the widespread, highly credibleallegations about possible misconduct by the CIA in itstreatment of terrorism suspects. Despite literally hundreds ofnews articles in the last few weeks detailing at length theabuses of the CIA and the government at large, Sen. PatRoberts of Kansas is blocking a full inquiry into "the detention,interrogation and rendition authority" [that's when we ship offprisoners to countries like Saudi Arabia so they can be tortured-- something widely reported but which Bush insists we neverdo] of government agencies for intelligence purposes, says theNew York Times.Roberts wants to downplay the investigation by only doing thestandard oversight and he certainly wants to wait until the CIAdoes its own investigation of itself...which the CIA says maytake a while, don't you know. If you're in Kansas, please giveRoberts an earful. Why is he ashamed of the truth?
