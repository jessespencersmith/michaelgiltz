LOMBARDI  ** out of ****
Circle in the Square on Broadway
Sometimes, the most fascinating people can be
terrible interviews. Either they're too protective of
their image or -- outside the area of expertise that hasmade them famous -- they're simply boring. Whateverthe case, complex and intriguing people sometimes
just don't give good quotes. That seems to be the
problem with the ornery (but lovable!) football coachVince Lombardi in this new bio-play by Eric
Simonson (director of A Note Of Triumph , the
Academy Award winning short film on legendary
radio talent Norman Corwin).
It's 1965 and Lombardi (a fine Dan Lauria of TV's The Wonder Years ) is in the midst of his remarkable

<p>revival of the Green Bay Packers. But a "hatchet job" in Esquire  has Lombardi licking his wounds, wary
but ready to cozy up to a cub reporter from Look magazine that promises to do a much friendlier profile.
It's amusing to see how much of a lackey the reporter feels: he stays with Lombardi and Lombardi's wrywife (an amusing Judith Light of Ugly Betty  and Who's The Boss) , stands where he's told to stand, sort
of avoids the questions he's told to avoid and generally acts like its a privilege to be in the presence of the
Great Man.
But, again, there's that problem of interviews. Every time Lombardi says something interesting, he puts it
off the record. His wife is hilariously blunt, but she's savvy as well and mostly interested in protecting herhusband, sometimes from himself. (Lombardi can be gruff, to say the least.) And a play structuredaround a reporter spending a week with a subject breaks the crucial rule of fiction: show, don't tell.Instead, almost all we get is the tell.
Shadows in Lombardi's life are revealed, such as a son who feels overshadowed by his dad and a brother
who lives in San Francisco, hates football and loves to shop. (Are these supposed to be related?) And
clearly when Lombardi is focused on an upcoming game (which is always), he's not much fun to be
around. The hapless reporter (Keith Nobbs in a thankless role) just seems in the way.
Then, out of nowhere, we actually see Lombardi doing his job and the fascination that the man holds is
clear. He rips apart two players for arriving at camp early: the happy go lucky Paul Hornung (a charmingBill Dawes) and the slow but sincere Jim Taylor (Chris Sullivan). Just when you feel his wrath, Lombardi
turns on a dime and woos them with kindness and tough love. Suddenly, after endless talk describing him
as a coach and statistics about what he's accomplished, we actually see Lombardi being  a coach and it's
genuinely intriguing and dramatic.
This happens again when Lombardi upbraids Taylor again and Taylor stands up for his right to be
represented by an agent. The dance of a coach -- father figure and tyrant to the players but also
answerable to the owners and yet wanting to do right by his men who go into battle for him week afterweek -- is revealed again, not through a question and some stock answer, but by actually watching him atwork.
That's the fatal flaw in Lombardi . The entire play is structured around a reporter digging up info and
asking questions. Lombardi isn't famous for answering questions, he's famous for being a football coach.
And when we find ourselves bored stiff by the reporter's crisis of conscience, we know it's really gone out
of bounds. If the play had focused on one week of preparing for a game and dumped the hoary notion ofa reporter as a device to reveal the Truth, it might have had a shot.
Lauria and Light are both pros, who land every joke with precision. Lauria's pep talks to the team aren't
very inspiring, in part because he's talking to the audience instead of the players, but his stormypersonality comes across well. Light is even better as his woozy but perceptive wife; it would be great to
see her again in a more demanding role and a better play. Nobbs hasn't much to do, but the three players
(which also includes Robert Christopher Riley as Dave Robinson) are appealing in their all too briefturns.
Director Thomas Kail and projection designer Zachary Borovay make clever use of the Circle in the
Square dimensions by projecting video right onto the floor of the stage itself. And for a change thechallenge of the space keeps things interesting. Scenes that might have been plainer on a standard stage

<p>are at least spiced up by having the couch rotate in 360 degrees so everyone gets a look at the actors
sitting on it. Dramatically the rotation is pointless but, hey, it's something to watch -- kind of like the
cheeerleaders during a game when you're rooting for your team but know they're not going to make itinto the end zone.
LA BETE  ** 1/2 out of ****
Music Box on BroadwayI missed the original production of La Bete  but dimly recall the reviews. I fear I'm repeating them when I
say that this comedy in rhymed verse does an all-too effective job in creating a boor who outstays his
welcome. That's not quite the case with Mark Rylance, perhaps my favorite actor working in the theater
right now. He and David Hyde Pierce and a very effective Joanna Lumley have delicious fun deliveringthe constant flow of zingers, word plays, puns and insults embedded like shrapnel in David Hirson'soverflowing dialogue. When Rylance as Valere bursts into the room of actor/playwright Elomire (Pierce)
and begins to talk and talk and talk, the audience is happily braced for what is essentially a 20-minute
barrage of words. The fool may become tiresome but the actors do not, really, and if there's a sense of
relief when it finally comes to a stop (or at least a respite), there's also a feeling of genuine pleasure.
Rylance can do no wrong for me and he offers a masterclass in buffoonery. Whatever the flaws of the play
-- and this production reveals it to be flawed -- it's still an event just to witness him at work. Pierce is
every bit his match, relishing the chance to simmer and stew and stumble in awe at such an ass. Stephen
Ouimette as Pierce's hunch-backed right hand man is equally a joy to watch as he is both steamrolled byRylance and desperate to restrain Pierce. Lumley was the wild card to me, but she's nicely restrained in
an imperious way and vicious when need be.
I haven't mentioned the plot yet because the plot seems so beside the point when compared to the
sparkling, playful dialogue. And when the plot demands our attention, it collapses under its own weight.
Pierce is the head of an acting troupe in France that is under the sponsorship of Lumley's Princess. She
becomes inexplicably enamored with the idiotic Rylance and demands that Pierce take him on. Piercerefuses in the name of Art. A titanic battle of wills ensues. Lumley soon understands that Rylance might
not be the genius she first supposed but like all patrons is willing to be flattered into believing her
mistake was actually quite perceptive. (Rylance, not such a fool after all, insists his play was designed  to

seem more flawed on a second viewing. Insert ironic comment here.)
Lumley and Pierce battle it out and suddenly the clownish behavior of Rylance has given way to a very
real battle royale. Pierce stubbornly refuses to back down and gracelessly stamps home his opinion,
leaving Lumley no room for self-respect unless she slaps him down. Suddenly his troupe is not only
siding with the fool to protect their meal ticket but seemingly pleased by Rylance's crowd-pleasing
nonsense more than Pierce's plays, which apparently are sinking into High Art tiresomeness.
I'm not quite certain where this production heart lies. Is Rylance the king of mediocrity or is Pierce a
pretentious man too stubborn to give in a little and appease his patron? (Surely Rylance could play a Fool
in one of his works.) Or is Pierce the protector of real artistry? The finale certainly suggests so, with the
production design of this show grandly revealing him alone on a windswept, stormy landscape like KingLear. Pierce's daughter stares at the audience in a confused and perhaps accusatory manner. Are we toblame?
All these ideas could be embodied at once of course; they might all be a little true. But it's depressingly
obvious that the play which skewers or at least raises the question of High Art versus Mediocrity (or is it
Pretension versus Fun?) collapses under its own profundity at the end. Still, I'd hate to miss these three
actors in these roles -- or the troupe when they amusingly dissect acting styles in a marvelous moment.
Director Matthew Warchus directs ably. But the set and costume design by Mark Thompson does the
story no favors with its overblown final image. I also find Rylance's outfit a tad too obvious in itsclownishness. On the other hand, the main set -- a book-lined library that stretches up to the sky - is my
idea of what heaven must look like. So La Bete  is a treat, just a half-baked one.
