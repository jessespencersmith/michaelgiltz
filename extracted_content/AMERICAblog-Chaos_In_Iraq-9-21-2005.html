9/21/2005 12:00:00 AMMore on the story behind that photo of a British soldier inflames that John posted below. If you didn't see that imageand only read the NYT, you'd believe this: British soldiersworking under cover were arrested by Iraqi police. Whenofficials refused to hand them over to the coalition forces, thesoldiers were "freed as a British armored vehicle blastedthrough the wall of their jail." Sounds sketchy and not good --but wait until you read the Independent's far more explosiveversion:British troops were struggling to maintain control inBasra last night after the city exploded into bloodyviolence following the alleged killing of an Iraqipoliceman by a British soldier.Two British servicemen, dressed in civilian clothes, wereheld at Basra's main police station after the incident.Outside, rioting began as the city threatened to descendinto anarchy.Last night, British forces used up to 10 tanks -supported by helicopters - to smash through thewalls of the jail and free the two British servicemen.John Reid, the Defence Secretary, later confirmed they wereback with UK forces.Around 150 prisoners were said to have escapedduring the assault, which was condemned as "barbaric,savage and irresponsible" by Mohammed al-Waili, theprovincial governor. But the Ministry of Defence disputedthe claim, saying that the release of the soldiers had been"negotiated".British troops using massive force to free soldiers being held by theirallies? Sparking a riot in a major city and freeing dozens of Iraqiprisoners in the process? This is a tipping point for the UK'scommitment to Iraq. Another word for it? Chaos.
