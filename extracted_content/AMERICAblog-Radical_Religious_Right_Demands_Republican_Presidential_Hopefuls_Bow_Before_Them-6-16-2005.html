6/16/2005 12:42:00 PMA who's who of the radical far right religious hate groups --James Dobson of Focus on the Family, Tony Perkins of FamilyResearch Council, Rev. Donald Wildmon of American FamilyAssociation, Gary Bauer of American Values, Paul Weyrich ofFree Congress Foundation -- are banding together to screenRepublican Presidential hopefuls.Gary Bauer, president of American Values, said in aninterview that the sit-down sessions, likely to begin afterthe 2006 elections, would be "a very effective way to naildown where people are on cultural issues." He saidcandidates have become "very astute" at answering writtenquestionnaires in ways that avoid making firmcommitments.They might even endorse one candidate if all those power-hungryfellows can agree to support the same guy. (Rick Santorum,perhaps?) I'll be praying that they do -- a Republican candidatebranded as the choice of these far right radicals would be hobbledseverely during the general election.Imagine being able to link him (or her?) to every single wacky,hate-filled statement these guys indulge in. He'd either have todistance himself from them repeatedly or finally repudiate them if hewanted any pretense of being in the mainstream, thus ticking offtheir followers. Or he'd stay arm in arm with them and scare off thesane moderate majority of Americans.Please, please, please, fellows, hand out a scarlet letter to yourfavorite candidate. Make our day.
