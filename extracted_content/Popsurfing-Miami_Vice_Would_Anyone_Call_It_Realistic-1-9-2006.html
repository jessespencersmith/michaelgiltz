            <p>M O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6"Miami Vice" -- Would Anyone Call It Realistic?Except The New York Times?Their writers get paid much better than I do, so I'm sure they can takethe heat. And yes, I'm sure any of my own hack work could be just aseasily mocked. But then, I don't work for the paper of record, so no onecares when I write something silly. So with that out of the way, here'smy latest beef.The NYT is never worse than when trying to glibly deal with popculture and/or trying to treat glib pop culture too seriously. They're notEntertainment Weekly and shouldn't try. Here's the NYT on "MiamiVice" from Friday's paper:[Crockett and Tubbs] were hardened, dedicated officers, butthey also made their fair share of blunders, mistakes and dumbassumptions. They were dissolute but human, gritty butglamorous: the MTVification of "Hill Street Blues."Crockett and Tubbs were hardened and dedicated? "Miami Vice" -- theshow in which, as the NYT mentions, Crockett kept a pet alligator, theyfloated around Miami in designer clothes and drove ultra-expensiveautomobiles to the sounds of Phil Collins -- was realistic, in thetradition of "Hill Street Blues?" It was fun, but gritty? Really? And thenthere's this from the intro:It's settled. The '80s were more fun. Aerobics, unlike ellipticalmachines and Pilates, were inclusive.Huh? I'm still arguing with Monkeyboy about what that means. Ithought it was referring to class, as if aerobics were for the masses andPilates and elliptical machines for the wealthy. Monkeyboy says itrefers to the way they were done, aerobics typically in classes andPilates more often with a one-on-one instructor and elliptical machinesin the isolating world of the gym, I suppose. He couldn't be bothered toput up much fuss when I argued the classic '80s image of aerobics waswomen performing it at home, alone, via the Jane Fonda Workout tapeand that Pilates can be done in groups. (Can't it?)What do you think this rather bizarre sentence is referring to? Besides,shouldn't that read "Aerobics WAS inclusive" anyway, since aerobics issingular?Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
