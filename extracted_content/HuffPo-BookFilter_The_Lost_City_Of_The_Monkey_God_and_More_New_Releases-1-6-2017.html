BookFilter: "The Lost City Of The Monkey God" and More New Releases</p>
<p>THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD by Douglas Preston  It sounds like the title for a new Indiana Jones 
adventure. But this nonfiction thriller about plunging into the interior of the Honduran jungle is actually true and  
a perfect read for armchair travelers or would-be adventurers who bemoan the fact that there's nothing left to 
discover. Turns out there is, namely a legendary civilization that rivaled the Mayans but disappeared some 500 years ago. Douglas Preston's true-life tale includes everything from the latest technology to ancient curses to scientific backbiting and a mysterious illness that came out of the jungle and is headed your way....

FOOD, HEALTH AND HAPPINESS by Oprah Winfrey  Oprah Winfrey is going to launch her own book imprint 
later this year. But first we've got a new cookbook/guide to life from the media powerhouse. Oprah has always  
shared with fans the pleasure and peril food has for her. She may be working with Weight Watchers now but clearly that doesn't mean you have to suffer. Not with recipes on tap like "Unfried Chicken" and "Sustainable</p>
<p>Chilean Sea Bass with Lemon Fennel Chutney." Favorite chefs like Rosie Daley are here, but it's Oprah's 
vision for how to enjoy... Read More.

***************  WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE BOOK OF THE YEAR?
I'm a compulsive list-keeper. It's true!  Looking back over the one hundred books I finished in 2016, I realized 
only two books earned a perfect four stars out of four from me. (I'm a tough grader; be glad I'm not your teacher.) One was  Evicted by Matthew Desmond,  a terrific work of narrative nonfiction about how housing and
 
poverty are inextricably linked. You saw it on a lot of best of the year lists.  The other was a reissue of a 
classic-but-forgotten mystery -- Black Wings Has My Angel by Elliot Chaze,  the tale of a sucker who gets 
hooked up with a dangerous gal when planning the perfect crime. What could possibly go wrong? 
What were your favorite reads of the year and why? Email us at newsletter@bookfilter.com  and we'll share 
some of your choices in a future column. Because the next best thing to reading a great book is sharing it with
others.

SELECTION DAY by Aravind Adiga  In this new novel by the Booker Prize-winning author, the character of 
Mohan Kumar is obsessed with the desire for upward mobility. So he has forsaken a rural peasant life and taken his two sons, Radha and Manju, talented cricket players, to a slum on the outskirts of Mumbai. There he
 
dreams of turning them into champions of the game and overcoming the humiliation of his life as a chutney salesman. As the most psychotic version of the stage mother, or soccer mom, or little league dad that I have ever come across, Mohan is.... Read More.</p>

MRS. SHERLOCK HOLMES by Brad Ricca  Ever heard of Grace Humiston? In the early 1900s, she was one of 
the most famous women in America. Humiston was the first female District Attorney in the US, a crusader 
against horrific working conditions down South and a defender of immigrants and the poor in New York City. And in 1917, Humiston made headlines around the world when she cracked a cold case involving a missing young woman, bringing the killer to justice and showing the NYPD to be incompetent or corrupt. The press dubbed her "Mrs. Sherlock Holmes" and this new memoir tells the story of that infamous.... Read More.

<p>HOW TO HYGGE by Signe Johansen  OK. First things first: it's hygge as in hoo-guh. "Hoo" as in "June" and 
"guh" as in, um, "guh." Anyway, hygge is a trendy term in the US but a way of life in Danish society. It's like 
the idea of cocooning, but without any high tech binge-watching of TV in the mix. Think home-made candles, good friends, delicious treats and a toasty fire, preferably made with logs you chopped down yourself. Yes, hygge is a very do-it-yourself, hand-crafted approach to happiness. It's shared experiences over personal possession, friends not "contacts".... Read More.

THE MISTRESS by Danielle Steel  Danielle Steel has gone all James Patterson on us. No, she's not suddenly 
loaning her name to books mostly written by others. But she has dramatically sped up her output. Instead of 
one or two books a year, she's creating a book practically every other month! Fans don't seem to mind and</p>
<p>they're sure to embrace this timely tale of a desperately poor (but beautiful!) young Russian woman named 
Natasha who becomes the plaything of a powerful oligarch. She relishes the security of his money and power, remaining perfectly loyal and mostly content...until a handsome young artist named Theo Luca comes into her life.... Read More.

***************HAPPY BIRTHDAY J.R.R. TOLKIEN!
J.R.R. Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892 and if nothing else he was responsible for my favorite Christmas 
gift ever. One summer in the 1970s, a neighborhood mom pushed me to read "The Hobbit." I came back two days later for her copy of "The Fellowship Of Ring" and two days after that for "The Two Towers" and two days after THAT for "The Return Of The King." I was never much of a re-reader and so it didn't occur to me to even ask for my own copies as a gift. Nonetheless, my mom casually picked up a boxed set of all four paperbacks (for a grand total of maybe $8 at the time?). Christmas morning my parents were thrilled to present a much-needed ten speed bike. It was about as necessary as socks...and just as exciting to me. But "The Lord Of The Rings?!?!" I hadn't expected that yet it was exactly  what I wanted and I couldn't wait to dive 
in again. When my dad realized I'd already read the books, his jaw dropped. Why the heck would I want a copy of a book I'd already read? I felt bad but it really was the best present I ever got. And I devoured them again that Christmas and every Christmas for the next ten years. 
Tolkien's grandson Simon has a novel set during WWI  due out January 24 and Tolkien's tale of "Beren & 
Lúthien"  comes out in a new edition this May...just in time for my birthday. (Yes, mom, that's a hint.)

<p>WHAT DOESN'T KILL US by Scott Carney  So do you want to keep that New Year's resolution about getting 
into shape? Or do you want to laugh at such a puny goal and become an extreme sports enthusiast with Iron 
Tribe and other boot camp style programs? In this new work combining the latest science and a personal desire to push himself to the limit, author Scott Carney explores the newest science on what the human body can endure, profiles gurus like Wim Hof and takes his own plunge into extreme fitness, culminating in an attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro wearing only running shorts and sneakers....

LOVE AND FIRST SIGHT by Josh Sundquist  YouTube star Josh Sundquist has a huge online following thanks 
to being a Paralympic ski racer, surviving cancer, writing a best-selling memoir, touring the country as a motivational speaker and now becoming a debut novelist. "Love And First Sight" is the story of a blind high school student who discovers that suddenly being able to see at first creates a lot more problems than it solves, starting with a girlfriend that doesn't look anything like he's been told....
