Comanche Moon Rising 
This Lonesome Dove prequel is the 
season's most anticipated new Western. 
By Michael Giltz 
CASTING A MOVIE or television show 
is a difficult task; finding the right actor 
for the right role can make or break a 
project. When making a Western, how­
ever, it is just as crucial to cast the right 
animals for the right actors. 
The horses must be able to fulfill the 
requirements of the script, deal with all 
the distractions on a set without spoil­
ing a take, and, on top of it all, mesh 
with the comfort level of each actor and 
his or her various skills. 
For the upcoming CBS miniseries 
Comanche Moon-a prequel to Lone­
some Dove, one of the most popular TV 
events ever-boss wrangler and live­
stock coordinator Tim Carroll had the 
added challenge of filling all those needs 
not just once, but three times, because 
the epic time-span covered roughly 
from 1840 to 1880 and each main actor 
required three different mounts. 
"There were 24 'cast horses' for the 
main eight Texas Rangers:' explains Car­
roll, who has been working on film sets 
since he was 12 years old. "They're really good campaigner horses. They've been 
around the block, and they're really 
good on camera. I coordinate all the 
livestock and own all of it. Basically, I'm 
in the rental business. I own all my 
trucks and trailers and wagons and all 
the horses:' 
The miniseries looks at the early days 
of Gus McRae (Steve Zahn of You've Got 
Mail) and Woodrow Call (Karl Urban of 
The Lord of the Rings), two tough Texas 
Rangers. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee 
Jones memorably played those same 
men as aging veterans who went for one 
last cattle drive in the blockbuster 1989 
miniseries Lonesome Dove, based on the 
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Larry 
McMurtry (Brokeback Mountain). 
For Zahn, who owns a ranch in Texas, 
it was clearly the chance of a lifetime. 
"Steve is really into this cowboy stuff 
and so is Kar1;' notes Carroll. "But Steve, 
he really got into it. Weeks in advance, 
before we started production, he was 
out getting [on] horseback and running 
the rope and practicing all sorts of 
//-------"'\

~/ things. He's got some horses of his own, 
too. I had him on a Quarter Horse and 
then I had him on a big black horse that 
was half Thoroughbred and half Quar­
ter Horse. Steve likes nice-handling 
horses that stand well and put up with 
all the gunfire and all that." 
Many actors fall in love with the 
horses while filming and are disappoint­
ed when Carroll refuses to part with the 
animals after the project is finished. 
"Liam Neeson had this big black cast 
horse that Steve Zahn was also riding. 
Neeson just fell in love with him [while 
making Seraphim Falls] and wanted to 
take him home. The problem is, I've 
raised these horses from colts and 
they're kind of family. It would be like 
giving your family away. If we get a good 
cast horse, we keep 'em. Besides, it's not 
really worth selling, even if it's for a 
tremendous amount of money, because 
then you gotta replace them." 
Carroll has seen some lean times over 
the years-for a while only commercials 
and print ads like the Marlboro Man 
kept him afloat-but the last three years 
have been nonstop, with the miniseries 
Into the West and now Comanche Moon 
proving to be the most elaborate pro­
ductions. 
"We had a hundred Indians mounted 
and a hundred loose horses just for one 
scene," says Carroll. "It was the Austin 
raid: the Indians came in, raided the 
town and stole all the horses. So we had 
a master shot of them riding into town 
and then the battle, and then we took all 
those horses and all those Indians and 
nine times we came out of town with 
them running as hard as they could. 
And never stubbed a toe. It was quite 
something." 
Carroll has a good feeling about Co­
manche Moon, even though sequels are 
always intimidating and risky-and the 
overwhelming success of Lonesome Dove 
is a hard act to follow. Yet, sometimes 
everything just works out right: one of 
Carroll's horses, Magnum, had his first 
job on Lonesome and Carroll decided to 
retire him when the Comanche shoot 
was over. "A good start," muses Carroll, 
"and a good ending." •</p>
