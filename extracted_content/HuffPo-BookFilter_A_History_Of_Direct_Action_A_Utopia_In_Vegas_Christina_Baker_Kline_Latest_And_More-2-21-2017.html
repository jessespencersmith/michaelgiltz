<p>THE KINGDOM OF HAPPINESS by Aimee Groth  
If you lead a hugely successful business -- one that sold to Amazon for more than $1 billion -- it's natural 
to think you're really smart about business. It's also natural to think you're smart about everything else too.Meet Zappos head Tony Hsieh. With others, he turned the online site for buying shoes into a powerhouse, in part by making it a great place to work. Then he decided to create a great place to work and  live and 
Hsieh chose to do it in downtown Las Vegas. He also challenged journalist Aimee Groth to join him in this utopian experiment. Depending on your point of view, the result is a book that may detail the hubris of a business man gone mad or a new way of imagining our lives.... Read More.

A PIECE OF THE WORLD by Christina Baker Kline</p>
<p>Christina Baker Kline was the author of several popular and well-reviewed novels when she suddenly 
enjoyed transformative success with her 2013 novel "Orphan's Train." After six years recovering or avoiding or perhaps reveling in that dizzying achievement, she has returned with a new novel. Based on the famous Andrew Wyeth painting "Christina's World," it tells the story of the relationship between the artist and a woman plagued by illness who would prove his greatest inspiration. (Perhaps the novel isn't called "Christina's World" because the publisher feared people would think it was a memoir?) In any case, Michael Chabon and others have already hailed it as a worthy successor to "Orphan's Train".... Read More.

CHRISTMAS IN...FEBRUARY?  
Poet Dylan Thomas  recorded his tour de force reading of that  remarkable short story "A Child's Christmas 
In Wales"  on February 22, 1952 at New York City's  Chelsea Hotel. Thank two pioneering women!  Barbara 
Holdridge and Marianne Mantell were convinced there was a market in the US for audio recordings of 
poetry. They couldn't find any takers for Shakespearean recitals or medieval music so they focused on poets reading from their own work. They dug into their own pockets and launched the famed label Caedmon Audio with Thomas's vibrant tale of his charming childhood memories. With this bold gamble, Holdridge and Mantell planted the seeds for audio recordings of books, short stories, poems and radio plays ever since, a genre that is bigger than ever and one of the few areas of growth in the book industry. However, it wasn't the first time Thomas was recorded. Back in the UK, the BBC lied to the notoriously unreliable man and said he's have to pre-record a radio show that would normally be performed live. And no wonder: In 1952, Thomas showed up at the Chelsea Hotel drunk, refused  to do the poems he'd agreed 
upon and insisted  he do "A Child's Christmas In Wales" instead and no he didn't have a copy of it so 
someone would damn well have to find one! The result? A masterpiece of performance.

<p>CONVERGENCE  by Peter Watson  Centuries ago, a person could be conversant in all the sciences by 
having a cabinet of curiosities, building a telescope and dabbling in this or experimenting in that. No more.  
What did chemistry have to do with astronomy anyway? Science seemed to have splintered. Now it's 
coming together once again. In this fascinating work, Peter Watson demonstrates how so many disparate areas of enquiry have become interlinked in the past 150 years, with the Theory Of Evolution, the insight of
 
the conservation of energy and more. Each new wave of breakthroughs seems to turn all those disciplines into one web of knowledge. Watson dubs it the Convergence and with so many examples to draw upon, it's hard to argue with as a defining principle. It's a sweeping tale filled with mini-dramas, concise portraits of many scientists and a way of making complex ideas graspable by a layperson like myself.... Read More.

reporting for newspapers like the LA Times to guarantee snappy writing? Check. Blurb from famous authortouting this book as the real deal? Check.

PLANTS YOU CAN'T KILL by Stacy TornioBelieve us when we say we could prove the title of this book wrong. What's the opposite of a green 
thumb? (Brown thumb? Thumb of death?) Whatever it's called, that's what we've got. But hope springs eternal and if we can find plants that we can't kill right away, that alone will be a triumph. So if you're challenged in the garden or just want to learn about  some hardier than usual suggestions for planting, this 
might be the book for you. And hey, there's always next spring to try again.... Read More.

<p>A CONJURING OF LIGHT by V.E. Schwab
Ok, we're a little impatient. Sometimes we like to wait until a series is over before diving in. (Who like to 
wait a year or more for the next installment in a story? No one!) That's especially the case with a work that has a clear beginning, middle and end in sight. So the finale of V.E. Schwab's fantasy series is high on our list of what to tackle next. It features strong reviews and a growing fan base from start to finish, so that's always a good sign. The tale involves magicians who can travel back and forth between alternate Londons that struggle for dominance. There's Gray London and Red London and White London and even once Black London (though no one likes to talk about Black London). If binge-reading is your thing, let's get together and start a Book Of The Week Club.... Read More.

<p>DIRECT ACTION by L.A. Kauffman  
"What happened to the American left after the Sixties?" That is the question that has bedeviled activist 
and journalist L.A. Kaufmann, who has been on the ground at protest movements her entire life, ranging from anti-apartheid to ACT UP/NY to Earth First! and beyond. She's wrestled with that query for years and the result is this scholarly work. Instead of a splintering of the left from its anti-Vietnam focus to a hundred different issues, Kaufmann paints a history of direct action. She sees its roots stretching far back but marks the beginning in the modern era to the MayDay protest in DC on May 3, 1971 right up to #BlackLivesMatter. It's thoughtful and interesting and ultimately hopeful for those who imagined the days of radical activism were stuck in the distant past.... Read More.

THE WORLD TO COME: STORIES by Jim Shepard</p>
<p>Author Jim Shepard's most recent novel was the gripping heart-breaker "The Book Of Aron," easily one of 
our favorites of 2015. Now he's returned with a new collection of short stories. They're built around real-lifeevents of overwhelming urgency, from French balloonists pushing the envelope on manned flight to pioneer housewives looking to forge a connection amidst harsh isolation to explorers testing their limits at the Arctic Circle. I've only read the first story, a corker of dreadful tension about the true story of a military disaster in peacetime that was wholly preventable. Delivered in a tone of reserve that's almost maddening as the tension rises, it captures the idiotic bureaucracy that stranded good men on a rickety rig in the Atlantic, the painful frustration of their loved ones back home and the nightmare of a storm of the century that dooms them all. Like all of Jim Shepard's work, it feels wholly original and yet of a piece with everything else he's done before.... Read More.
