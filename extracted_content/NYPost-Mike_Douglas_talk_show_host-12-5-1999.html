By MICHAEL GILTZ 
Talk show icon Mike 
Douglas is almost 
always right about 
who will win the rat­
ings battles -even if it 
takes the rest of us a little 
time to catch up. 
When David Letterman 
and Jay Leno squared ofT in 
late night, 'The Post's Cindy 
Adams caHed up Douglas 
for his take on their talenta. 
"I said at the time Leno's 
going to win it because he 
has wider appeal: says 
Douglas, "And then for 
about a year Letterman 
ruled that spot. But now it's 
aH turned around, and 1 
don't know that it's ever 
going to turn back for 
David. 
"I quite honestly watch 
both of them, and 1 watch 
David more than 1 do Jay." 
he says. "I don't know why; 
he fascinates me. 
,MBut . you know' some-thing? When his producer , 
Bob Morton, left that show, 
it went straight downhill . 
I'm sure David knows about 
this. He must think about'it 
from time to time. But he's 
never invited the man back. 
1 think that had a lot. to do 
with it. Producers are very 
important people." 
Douglas is in town to pro­
mote "l'\l Be Right Back: a 
chatty, breezy memoir 
about his days hosting the 
most popular talk show of 
its day. Filled with an 
astonishing number of 
names from music, politics, 
and Hollywood, it also fea­
tures his sometimes caustic 
comment s on the current 
glut of talk shows. 
It's no surprise the 73-
year-old admires Rosie 
O'Donnell: She publicly 
declared Douglas her idol, 
openly modeled her ~how on 
his and even wrote the 
introduction to hi. book. "I

also seen musIcal' hlgh-: 
lights from his show aired 
on VHl and a boxed set of 
episodes featuring John 
Lennon and Yoko.Ono seH­

Douglas believes Johnny 
Carson is the gold standard 
and that few people -and 
certainly not the two men 
duking it out in Carson's 
old time slot -can mea­
sure up. 
"I'm sorry," says Douglas. 
"I like both of those guy_; 1

saying this for that rea!!On. 
I could care less. I don't

He was the first syndicated 
talk show hit, the first to make 
$1 million a year, and the first 
to fight off an upstart. Who 
better to straighten out today's 
crop of gab masters?

trades and other industry 
news quickly show the 
avuncular Douglas is just 
as much on top of the busi· 
ness as he ever was. 
"Oprah is unbelievable," 
says Douglas. "People say. 
'Oh, they're paying her too 
much money.' She's worth 
every nickel; she wouldn't 
be getting it if she weren't. 
The shows that she is 
doing! 
"One of the first book club 
shows. she had on the 
author and all these lovely 
ladies who'd read the book 
and in some way it affected 
their lives. I tell you, tha!"s 
the best television rve ever 
Bcen. This woman is a mar· 
vel; she can handle any sit· 
uation." 
Perhaps Douglas can 
appreciate her innovations 
because he pioneered so • Conan

Howard Stern? Douglas meet many people who lis· ten when they do an inter· 
view. That's the key. Listen." 
Indeed, Douglas knows 
better than anyone that 
some of the most talented 
people in the world won't 
make good talk show hosts. 
"Sid Ceasar was absolutely 
brilliant. But he could not 
walk in front of a camera 
and say, 'Good evening and 
welcome to Your Show of 
Shows.' They had to have 
somebody else do it." 
While he hasn't seen 
Martin Short's show (except 
when he was a guest on it 
. last week), Douglas thinks 
that might be the same 
story again. 
"What a talent that young 
man is," aays Douglas. "But 
that doesn't always trans· 
late into doing a talk show. 
He's a great performer and 
a funny, funny man. 
"But rm told, according to 
my sources the 
Hollywood Reporter and 
Daily Variety -that it's not 
doing well ratings·wise." As he points out, if 
there's just one miss· 
ing factor -the right 
producer, the right sidekick 
- a show simply won't 
work. When told Andy 
Richter was leaving The 
Conan O'Brien Show, 
Douglas knew that wasn't 
good news for a show he'd 
enjoyed. 
"Why is he leaving?" won· 
ders Douglas. who rattles off 
the names of great second 
bananas like Tim Conway 
and Jonathan Winters who 
weren't meant to carry a 
show by themselves. "That's 
a tremendous asset that 
Conan's going to be miss· 
ing." 
Television's been missing 
Douglas for too long, as 
well. Though happily 
retired, Douglas admits he's 
occasionally intrigued by 
the possibility of getting 
back in the game. 
He's in no mood to reo 
enter the grind of a daily 
show, but a weekly cable 
program or series of spe· 
cials does offer temptation . 
The c108est he came was 
several years ago, when a 
British talk show host aimi· 
lar to Douglas struck gold 
by returning to the air after 
many years away. 
"She'd play her tape.

and Peter Cook when they 
were brash young guys and 
then bring them on today to 
talk to them again. They 
w8nted to do the lame 
thing here with me and I 
got so excited. 
"It got 8S far as meetings. 
I don't see how it could have 
missed. I had ideas .pring­
ing out of my mind. I had so 
and so on and they're .till 
around. What would they 
say today? 
"It could have been 8
