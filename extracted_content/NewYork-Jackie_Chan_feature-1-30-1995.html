            <p>Retrosp~give I ' HI-yaaaa 1. Much of the fun of watching a Hollywood action film is scrutinizing the special effects, then 
evaluating the movie by how well the audience was fooled into believing that 
ArnoldlSlylJ(eanu was really in danger. Watch a Jackie Chan movie, on the other hand, 
and you'll know he's in danger. He combines physical grace with comic aplomb to pull off one jaw­
dropping stunt after another. "Super Jackie: The Best of Jackie Chan" at Cinema Village January 
27 through February 16 (see "Museums, Societies, Etc.") is a chance to appreciate anew Police 
Story, Drunken Master, 
and the other classics that 
have earned him a loyal 
following here. Once dis­
missed as "chop-socky" 
movies fit only for quickie 
exploitation runs, Hong 
Kong cinema has garnered 
increasing critical and 
popular acclaim, and this 
is a sweet turn of events 
for Chan. Little more than 
a decade ago, hell-bent on breaking into the U.s. market, he accepted bit parts in Cannonball Run 
I and II, and never came close to finding the success he'd had overseas. His Asian fans, in the 
meantime, had moved on. "I had a very tough time getting back on top," Chan says, "but now I'm 
there and I'm happy. H American people like my movies, good; that's a bonus." Chan is also happy 
to see Hong Kong movies finally getting their day in the sun. "Years ago, the movies were just fight­
ing. People would say, 'Why are you looking at me?' and then fight. 'I don't like you.' Fight. But 
now we care about everything-acting, comedy, drama, motorcycle scenes." And though Hong 
Kong will come under China's control in 1997, the 40-year-old Chan has no plans to move. "Oh, 
no no no. I'll still stay in Hong Kong. Even the Chinese government, when it's a Jackie Chan movie, 
they welcome it." MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
