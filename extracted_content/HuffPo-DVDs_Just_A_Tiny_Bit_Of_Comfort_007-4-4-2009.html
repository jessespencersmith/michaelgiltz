Entertainment News
The last few weekends, I've been watching as a 12
year old boy works his way through my JamesBond DVDs, something every young kid shoulddo on spring break when they're growing up. So Ifeel as ready as ever to tackle the newest Bond,Quantum of Solace  ($39.99 on BluRay and
$34.98 for regular DVD; MGM).
I think Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond, but felt
Casino Royale  was a bit overpraised. In contrast,
I think Quantum  is a bit under-praised. Both are
very sleek, fun action films that stay true to Bond
while obviously hewing more to the gritty, brutal character of the books than most of the series.The BluRay looks absolutely smashing and -- interestingly -- I found the action scenes easier tofollow on TV than I did in the theater. Maybe it's just a second viewing, but the cutting seemedmore organic and flowing than it did on the big screen. Is it the detail of the BluRay and the up-close nature of home viewing that in a way focuses your attention on each detail more directly?The Bond girl (Olga Kurylenko) is a major deficit, the weakest link of the movie. Given the movie'sdramatic heft, she's actually asked to act and show emotion, something Kurylenko fails atmiserably.
The cheekily named Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton) is infinitely more appealing and
interesting and unfortunately is onscreen all too little. If only their roles were reversed. Theultimate result is that Bond has far more chemistry with M (Judi Dench) than any other character
in the film. Their every scene together crackles. As was the original plan with the intended sequel
to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Quantum  picks up right where Casino Royale left off, with
Bond seeking vengeance for the death of his lover. It's a solid, solid entertainment and they're very
close to getting every element right and delivering a Bond for the ages.
In contrast, I watched Never Say Never Again  ($34.98 on BluRay but onsale at Amazon for

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: Just A Tiny Bit Of Comfort, 007
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-just-a-tiny-bit-of-c_b_183176.html [4/9/2009 12:57:50 PM]$14.98; Fox), which is just out. It's the first title in that format I've seen that doesn't look
smashing. I don't know whether it's the source print or laziness, but this is a grainy, unremarkable
DVD, appropriate for a very unremarkable Bond film. Yes, it's nice to see Sean Connery back as
007, but the tone is very jokey, a la Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home  and this is the most dated
Bond of all.
Typically, the secret agent lives in an unchanging universe of beautiful women, lavish resorts,
expensive cars and dry martinis. But in Never Say Never Again,  the real world intrudes to an
unpleasant degree. Poor Kim Basinger is seen doing aerobics and kicking up her heels at every
opportunity. Worse, when Bond is following her in a casino, she leaves the main area and walks
into a video parlor and Bond has to stand next to a bleeeping and blurping video game while trying
to look suave. It's cheesy and awful and pained in a way even the late Roger Moore entries never
were. There's tongue in cheek and then there's tongue on the ground in embarrassment. Stick to
Daniel Craig.
ANDY RICHTER HAS IT ALL  -- The best news recently for the over-crowded late-night talk
show world is that Andy Richter is rejoining Conan O'Brien when Conan takes over The Tonight
Show  this summer. Both have done well on their own but their chemistry together is undeniable.
Conan, of course, chugged along in late night. Richter has appeared in many films and sitcoms, but
his best work was on two shows he starred in: Andy Barker PI (which he says will be coming out onDVD shortly) and Andy Richter Controls The Universe: The Complete Series  ($39.98; Paramount).
This workplace comedy had a great cast (including Jonathan Slavin as a nebbishy buddy andJames Patrick Stuart as a Ken doll-handsome guy for whom everything came easy), a playfulsensibility (episodes about Andy dating a racist girl who was hot, etc) and fantasy sequences thatwere genuinely clever and fun. This set contains all 19 shows -- including the last five episodes,which never aired. They prove the show was just really hitting its stride. Very cult-worthy.
TELL NO ONE? NO ONE LISTENED  -- A genuine word of mouth hit that played and played
and played in theaters for much of 2008, Tell No One  ($27.98; Music Box Films) is a twisty crime
drama about a man accused of murdering his wife and several others who goes on the lam when he
receives an email message that seems to show her still alive. Great fun for about two-thirds of theway, the film goes off the rails when it takes about eight twists too many and then stops for tenminutes to explain the convoluted plot. But no else seemed to mind and it is craftily well played bya fine cast, including Kristin Scott Thomas who had a great year with this and I Loved You SoLong.
A BOLT FROM THE BLUE -- It's been a good year -- heck, it's been a good decade -- for
animated films. Three of my favorite films of the year were "cartoons:" Wall-E, Kung Fu Panda
and Azur & Asmar: The Prince's Quest.  And  Bolt ($32.99 special edition DVD and $39.99 on
BluRay; Disney),  which I missed in the theaters, comes pretty darn close. It's a very meta story for
a flick nominally aimed at kids. Bolt (John Travolta) is a dog who believes he has tremendousabilities and a supersonic bark, all used to protect Penny (Miley Cyrus). In fact, he's an actor on a
hit TV show where the crew works with elaborate care to make Bolt think he's really in the midst of
world-shaking danger in order to elicit a great performance. Then Bolt escapes. The usual hi-jinksand confusions ensue (helped by Susie Essman of Curb Your Enthusiasm  as a smart-ass alley cat
and Mark Walton as Bolt's biggest fan). Clever, engaging and -- just like Kung Fu Panda -- this filmhas some of the best action scenes of the year. If only live action movies like  Indiana Jones  seemed
less like cartoons and imitated the well-thought out mayhem of cartoons like  Bolt.  It's the best
non-Pixar Disney cartoon in years. All versions look very good but the BluRay is only $4 more than
the 2 disc DVD and it contains a regular DVD, the BluRay plus a digital copy, which gives families
all sorts of flexibility. I can't say this enough: I wish they'd eliminate single DVD and two disc
DVDs and just release everything in a package like this that includes all three formats. Just the
cost-savings of not having to carry three different versions should allow them to shave off a buck
right away. And who would complain? No one.
SHHHHHHH! GUY MADDIN IS A GENIUS  -- Easily one of the most distinctive and
remarkable talents of the past two decades is the criminally little known Guy Maddin, a man
obsessed with silent movies, early talkies, black and white images, twisted early memories andmuch more. He's made a string of utterly original films, ranging from operatic shorts that useRussian silent cinema as a touchstone to pseudo-documentaries about his own childhood. Yousimply can't go wrong with this guy if you're any sort of film buff. The Guy Maddin Collection($34.99; Zeitgeist) contains two films -- Twilight of the Ice Nymphs  and Archangel  -- and that

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: Just A Tiny Bit Of Comfort, 007
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-just-a-tiny-bit-of-c_b_183176.html [4/9/2009 12:57:50 PM]brilliant short, The Heart Of The World .) His most recent film My Winnipeg  (2008) reenacts
supposed scenes from his childhood like a fever dream.  Dracula: Pages From A Virgin's Diary
($29.99; Zeitgeist) takes the Royal Winnipeg Ballet's production of the classic horror novel down
the rabbit hole. I haven't mentioned several gems but perhaps the best introduction is Careful
($29.99; Zeitgeist) a "remastered and repressed" new edition of this movie about a village in the
mountains in the 1800s. Everyone -- men, women, children and even creatures -- have to be utterly
quiet for fear of starting an avalanche. With this absurd premise, Maddin revels in silent filmtechniques, beautiful tinting and sexual frenzy barely tamped down by society. It's devilishly cleverand absorbing and comes with loads of extras like a new commentary by Maddin, a 1997documentary about his career narrated by Tom Waits, a short film and more. Essential viewing.
SLUMMING IT  -- Slumdog Millionare  ($29.98; Fox) the movie is almost as much of a fairy tale
as the story about the people who made it. Its Dickensian tale of a boy from the slums who ends up
on national TV playing for a fortune on a game show -- but in fact just trying to contact the girl he
loves -- is energetically told with a terrific cast and high energy from director Danny Boyle. Boyle
has had his ups and downs commercially and creatively but surely no one expected this unlikely
story to be the biggest hit of his career. But in fact, as friends of mine pointed out, the film follows
the Boyle formula to a t: people (not often the most admirable) endure high drama on the way to
being deluged with piles of money. It happened in Shallow Grave and Trainspotting  and Millions
and perhaps others of his movies I'm not even aware of. Slumdog  is a good movie, though the bad
brother of our hero is almost cartoonishly bad and his fate is too heavy handed by half. But thecinematography and score and editing combine to keep it rushing along. Anil Kapoor -- so good as
the game show host -- will be in the cast of 24  next season. So the good news for this Oscar winner
keeps coming.
CRITERION COLLECTION  -- Any movie released by Criterion is worth owning: even if you're
not familiar with the film or it's not a favorite, they're sure to include so many valuable extras that
you'll get your money's worth and appreciate the film's significance as time passes on. When it
comes to Truffaut vs. Godard, I'm definitely in the Truffaut camp. Long after Godard had given up
delivering anything but the most self-absorbed, tiresome movies, Truffaut was celebrating the
power of telling stories with the late period effort The Last Metro  ($39.95 for regular OR BluRay;
Criterion), which tells of a French theater troupe trying to mount a show while France is occupied
by the Nazis. Catherine Deneuve stars with Gerard Depardieu. I haven't seen the BluRay but the
regular DVD looks marvelous and comes with extras like two audio commentaries (one with
Depardieu), old TV interviews, new video interviews with cast and crew, an interview withcinematographer Nestor Almendros and a short film made in 1958 by Truffaut and Godard beforeGodard became insufferable. Il Generale Della Rovere  ($29.95; Criterion) is a Roberto Rosselini
film starring director Vittorio De Sica (I'm always surprised when he acts but De Sica acted inhundreds of movies). De Sica -- in another WWII set film -- plays a con man forced by the Nazis toimpersonate a general and get info from Italian prisoners. For the first time, the bum feels a twingeof conscience. Extras include interviews and a visual essay. Finally, Andrzej Wajda is having asuccess with his new movie Katyn , which is also set in World War II. Criterion is releasing Danton
($39.95; Criterion), a two disc set about a previous upheaval, the French Revolution, starringDepardieu. Extras include interviews with Wajda and others as well as a 42 minute making-ofdocumentary. All the movies look terrific and it's great to see Criterion charging the same price forBluRay as it does for regular DVDs.
A-WOP-BOP-A-LOO-LOP-A-LOP-BAM-BOO  -- Little Richard had something to prove at the
Toronto Peace Festival in 1969  ($14.98; Shout). His last Top 40 hit was more than a decade earlier
and he would never have another. But Richard was always convinced of his own fabulousness and
knew the world should be convinced of it too. And he ripped the crowd into a frenzy during his halfhour set, thanks to timeless classics like "Lucille" and "Long Tall Sally" -- not to mention a shirtadorned with tiny mirrors and a towering wig. DA Pennebaker captures the moment well, thoughthe sound leaves something to be desired and at 30 minutes this is awfully short. Why not give usthree hours of the day-long festival, of which this could be a highlight? On its own, it's just notenough. Fans of Rory Gallagher will be more satisfied by Rory Gallagher Live In Cork  ($14.98;
Eagle Vision). Even though it captures Gallagher at the tail end of his career when ill health wasplaguing him, at least it's 80 minutes long and has a sense of occasion thanks to the setting of hishome town.
DOCUMENTARIES -- The Matador  ($24.98; City Lights) is definitely not for your PETA friends
as it shows the brutal world of bullfighting as David Fandila pushes himself to become the top-
ranked matador in the world. Killer At Large  ($19.95; Disinformation) is an all-encompassing look
at why obesity is rampant in this country, with a 45 minute educational version , deleted scenesand more. Academy Award nominee The Restless Conscience  ($39.95; Docurama) looks at the

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-just-a-tiny-bit-of-c_b_183176.html [4/9/2009 12:57:50 PM]Germans who resisted Naziism from Hitler's rise to power through the 20+ attempts to assassinate
the Fuhrer. The Great Depression  ($12.95; History) is an all-too-timely (but budget priced!) four
part look at the last time America was pounded by bad economic news. FInally, Light At The EdgeOf The World  ($19.98; Smithsonian) is a three hour Smithsonian special that looks at four
vanishing cultures in Peru, Polynesia, Himalayas and the Arctic.
ALSO OUT NOW:
Twilight  ($34.99 on BluRay and $32.99 for regular DVD; Summit), the so-so movie adaptation of
the wildly selling books about vampires in high school that didn't satisfy fans of the book (though
they saw the film three or four times just to make sure it wasn't that good) or those of us who
found the book poorly written but thought it might make good source material for a fun movie.
Still, Robert Pattinson does look awfully pale and dreamy in BluRay.
Schoolhouse Rock Earth  ($19.99; Disney) -- all these years after the original shorts, the creative
team comes back together to make 11 videos on global warming and darned if they don't pick up
right where they left off and deliver the goods, from "Save The Ocean" to "Windy and theWindmills."
Shakespeare's An Age Of Kings  ($49.98; BBC Video) -- It's unthinkable that something this
ambitious and high brow -- eight Shakespeare history plays told in 15 hours of TV with more than
600 speaking parts -- would be attempted by anyone other than the BBC. The cast is starry indeed,ranging from Judi Dench and Sean Connery to Julian Glover and Eileen Atkins. It was a smashingsuccess in 1960 and while much discussed has been rarely seen since then, until this fine five discset. Great fun for theater and Shakespeare buffs.
The Odd Couple/To Catch A Thief  ($24.99 each; Paramount) -- Two great teams. Jack Lemmon
and Walter Matthau were so perfect it's all the more remarkable that the TV series could almost
supplant our memory of the movie. And Cary Grant and Grace Kelly just had that spark essentialfor a great romantic thriller about a retired jewel thief, who may not be so retired after all. Nicelypackaged but these movies keep getting reissued. If you own them already, don't bother trading up.If you don't own them, what are you waiting for?
Praying With Lior  ($24.95; First Run) -- Somehow, this documentary about a young man with
Downs Syndrome preparing for his Bar Mitzvah manages to mostly avoid sentimentality even
though its premise -- Lior, despite or perhaps because of his challenge is closer to God than most --is close to fetishizing Downs. Also just out from First Run is The Kite  ($24.95; First Run), the story
of an arranged marriage that hits a snag when the 16 year old bride to be is held up at a checkpointbetween Lebanon and Israel. And Opera Jawa  ($24.95; First Run) is a visually inventive tale of a
husband who must face down the butcher who has seduced his wife.
Sesame Street's Follow That Bird  ($19.98; Warner Bros.) -- This is no Muppet Movie, just a very
thin feature about the dangers of adoption. Not really, of course, but Big Bird gets adopted and
then runs back home to Sesame Street. A very few modest laughs from Oscar the Grouch andSandra Bernhard as a surly waitress are the most anyone other than the very, very young willenjoy.
The Venture Bros. 3rd Season  ($44.98; Warner Bros) -- This silly spoof of 60s animated action
shows like Jonny Quest  is spot on in both the heroes, the depiction of hapless kids and the evil
villains. A little goes a long way when it comes to spoofs, but individual episodes are consistently
funny and the terrific score by JG Thirwell is rightly celebrated with a bonus CD. The BluRay looksgood, but costing $15 more than the regular DVD version at $30 makes it hard to justify unlessyou're a fanatic.
The same goes for Watchmen: Tales Of The Black Freighter  ($35.99 on BluRay and $27.95 on
regular DVD; Warner Premiere), a straight to DVD animated depiction of episodes from
Watchmen  that didn't make it into the film. The animation is ok, about equivalent to a decent TV
cartoon. You get good extras and a sneak peek at an animated spin on Green Lantern, but this isstrictly for uber fans and at 38 minutes, hardly worth plopping down for the BluRay.
Ricky Gervais: Out Of England - The Stand-Up Special  ($19.98; HBO) - Ricky Gervais is not
perfect, thank goodness. Obviously his second show Extras  wasn't as good as The Office. But no
show would be and Extras  was in fact quite funny on its own terms. So he did seem a bit infallible.
But while he's been a big success doing stand-up (which is still highly regarded in the UK), his first
special feels a bit forced. So, funny at moments (especially that goofy cover costume) but not SOfunny that we will all feel inferior forever.</p>

Broke And...Fans of stand-up might also enjoy Jim Gaffigan's King Baby  ($16.99; Paramount), which contains
an extended version of his Comedy Central concert, 3 episodes of Pale Force and 4 episodes of the
Internet show Our Massive Planet.
Fallen Angels/Happy Together ($29.95 each; Kino) -- director Wong Kar Wai is in a modest rut,
but fans can revel in all of his movies being released in careful new editions. These lovely looking
Kino titles include the gay drama Happy Together  and the delirious romance Fallen Angels  about
a contract killer and the woman who hires him. You can't talk about contemporary cinema without
knowing Wong Kar Wai.
Taggart Set 1 -- ($49.99; Acorn) is an odd name for the 19th season of the longest running crime
drama in the world, which began in 1983. But fans of the show's ever changing cast should enjoythe season that aired in the UK in 2002. Law & Order , which began in 1990, has to wait for this
show to die and then run another seven years just to tie it.
The Robe  ($34.98 on BluRay; Fox) -- the religious epic -- a close cousin to the more action-
oriented sword and sandal epic -- was a strange trend in cinema. Ponderous movies performed by
actors who felt obliged to stare off meaningfully into the distance...and yet audiences ate them up.Heck, Richard Burton even got an Oscar nomination for this typical if slightly above average entry.No expense was spared (you don't want to nickle and dime Jesus, do you?) and the lavishnessshows on this fine Blu Ray edition complete with an appreciation by Martin Scorsese, audiocommentary, making-of features, a newsreel and more.
The Silence Of The Lambs  ($34.99; MGM) -- Still one of the scariest, most compelling crime
dramas ever made. Jodie Foster is just as mesmerizing as Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins in this
cat and mouse game between an FBI agent and a serial killer. Ignore all the trashy sequels, the
increasingly ludicrous books and the many spoofs of Hannibal Lecter. This is a great film and looks
just stunning on this BluRay edition packed with extras.

Nice article. I bought Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale, and used the $5 off coupon that came
with Quantum of Solace to get Gold Finger for $10 all on BluRay. I also bought Bolt, Slumdog
Millionaire, and Twilight and was pleasantly surprised by these BluRays too.
