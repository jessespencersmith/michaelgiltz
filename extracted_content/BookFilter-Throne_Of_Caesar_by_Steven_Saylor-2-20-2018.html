you right there, wonderstruck and wide-eyed. Deliciously immersive,captivating entertainment from a justly celebrated writer." -- MargaretGeorge  In The Throne of Caesar , award-winning mystery author Steven
Saylor turns to the most famous murder in history: It's Rome, 44 B.C., andthe Ides of March are approaching.  Julius Caesar, appointed dictator for
life by the Roman Senate, has pardoned his remaining enemies andrewarded his friends. Now Caesar is preparing to leave Rome with his
legions to wage a war of conquest against the Parthian Empire. But he has
a few more things to do before he goes. Gordianus the Finder, afterdecades of investigating crimes and murders involving the powerful, hasbeen raised to Equestrian rank and has firmly and finally decided toretire. But on the morning of March 10th, heâs first summoned to meet
with Cicero and then with Caesar himself. Both have the same request of
Gordianus -- keep your ear to the ground, ask around, and find out ifthere are any conspiracies against Caesar's life. And Caesar has one othermatter of vital importance to discuss. Gordianus's adopted son Meto has
long been one of Caesar's closest confidants. To honor Meto, Caesar plans
to bestow on Gordianus an honor which will change not only his life butthe destiny of his entire family. It will happen when the Senate nextconvenes on the 15th of March. Gordianus must dust off his old skills andsee what plots against Julius Caesar, if any, he can uncover. But more
than one conspiracy is afoot. The Ides of March is fast approaching and at
least one murder is inevitable.

<p>What We Say
Is Steven Saylor retiring his long-running mystery series starring Gordianus the Finder? Certainly Gordianus himself hopes to
retire from ferreting out crime and deceit in the age of Caesar, Marc Antony and Cicero. He's an old man after all and long-
time fans of the tales will enjoy what feels like a career capper of a book. Saylor spends half his time reminiscing about old
jobs and how far Gordianus and his family have risen in society. The other half of the time is spent reminiscing with oldfriends and touching base with clients past, present (and perhaps future). When those clients include the orator Cicero (theman who prodded Gordianus into his first case) and the wife of Caesar and Cinna (the greatest poet of his age) at least
those moments are interesting. For all the nostalgic sense of winding things up with a graceful goodbye, this is a fine entry
point for newcomers not ready to start at the beginning. Why? Because the murder at the heart of this story -- theassassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides Of March -- is so familiar to modern readers. That should make this a pretty dullmystery since most schoolchildren know Brutus of "Et tu" fame will be involved, along with a host of politicians. (Thosebackstabbers.) But Saylor pulls a nifty fast one. While we've been waiting for the assassination of Caesar, Saylor has been
setting up another murder right in front of our eyes. He also takes on Shakespeare by offering his own Antony eulogy, not to
mention describing not one but TWO epic poems that are masterpieces we would read today...if they hadn't been lost intime. Still, for all the cleverness, this feels like a gentle goodbye, with the aching and elderly Gordianus happy to retire tohis garden for a good nap and perhaps a spot of writing.... -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"A rip-roaring detective adventure for fans of Steven Saylor's Roman intrepid hero Gordianus, who finds himself
embedded in the inner circle of Julius Caesar himself, as destiny ticks." -- Adrienne Mayor, author of The Poison
King and Amazons
"Steven Saylor's remarkable writing in The Throne of Caesar  is so rich in realistic detail that ancient Rome
literally unfolds before your eyes. If anyone wants to understand Rome at the end of the Republic, there's nobetter fictional narrative. Like Mary Renault's magic with words, historical fiction tinged by legend or myth
intertwined with known facts and archaeological verity just could not be more elegantly written than here with
Saylor's astonishing grasp of Roman life." -- Patrick Hunt, Ph. D., Stanford University, author of Hannibal
"Engrossing" -- The Wall Street Journal  on The Triumph of Caesar
"Superb" -- The Globe and Mail  (Toronto) on The Judgment of Caesar
"Compelling" -- USA Today on Wrath of the Furies
"Exquisite" -- The Philadelphia Enquirer  on A Mist of Prophecies
"Saylor can be a compelling (and sometimes very funny) storyteller, with a striking talent for historical
reconstruction. Half a century before imperial rule, Gordianus' Rome is a crumbling democracy; ideology is adirty word; politicians struggle for naked power, not principles; hands are everywhere in the till; political debate
is reduced to flashy spectacles and sound bites; only the forms of the democratic constitution still totter on. For
all its complex oddities, Saylor is asking us to feel very much at home in Gordianus' Rome." --n Mary Beard,
author of SPQR , in the Times Literary Supplement
