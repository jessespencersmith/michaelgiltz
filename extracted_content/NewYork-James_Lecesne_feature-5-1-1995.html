            <p>TalJlnt . une-man Acting Troupe James Lecesne likes to kvetch: "The Oscar goes to the pro­
ducer," he says in mock anguish, referring to Trevor, a 
film (based on a character in his one-man show Word of 
Mouthl that won this year's Academy Award for Best Live Ac­
tion Short_ But Lecesne knows he has no real reason to com­
plain_ After years of perfonning and refining Trevor, the gay 
teenager who attempts suicide, as well as the Georgia house­
wife who rushes around the g10be whenever the Virgin Mary is 
sighted, and the other eccentrics 
in Word of Mouth, he's just 
opened a new production of it at 
the Promenade on Sundays and 
Mondays (call 580-13131, with 
the added credibility factor of 
counting Mike Nichols and Elaine 
May among its producers_ Then, 
as if that weren't enough to keep 
one guy happy, on April 27 Extra­
ordinary Measures begins pre­
views (Call 647-0202)_ While not 
strictly a one-man show (three 
singers hover onstagel, it fea­
tures Lecesne as Paul-a man in 
the hospital near death-and as all the people who come to 
visit_ "Nine shows a week. This could be the theater Olympics, 
as far as I'm concerned," he jokes. The next hurdle would ap­
pear to be script development in Hollywood. "Somebody came 
to me with an idea that I may end up writing. And some people 
have met me and asked if I'd be interested in writing some­
thing and that they'd be interested in reading it. It's sort of dat-
ing, Hollywood style_" MICHAEL GILlZ</p>
