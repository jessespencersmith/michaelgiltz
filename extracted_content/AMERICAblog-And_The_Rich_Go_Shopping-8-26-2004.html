8/26/2004 01:12:00 PMYes, while the poor and the lower middle class feel their pocket booksshrinking, the rich are shopping away. Sales at high end stores aredoing fine while stores catering to the unwashed (us, don't you know)are slumping.Per the LA Times,"On Wednesday, Williams-Sonoma Inc. reported a better-than-expected 55% jump in its fiscal second-quarter profit, fueled bysales of furniture and other household goods at its Pottery Barnchain.It was the latest sign that retailers marketing to higher-endconsumers are prospering while major discount stores andmainstream apparel chains struggle. In recent weeks, Wal-MartStores Inc. and Gap Inc. have reported soft sales apparently becausea sharp rise in gasoline prices squeezed lower-income Americans...."But Coach Inc., which sells high-fashion handbags and accessories,reported a 113% jump in profit in its latest quarter while jewelerTiffany & Co. reported an 11% increase in U.S. sales. Sales at PotteryBarn stores open at least a year climbed 10.2% in the secondquarter. 'It appears that the higher-end retailers like Pottery Barn,Tiffany and Coach are all doing well,' Claire Gallacher, a retail analystwho noted that Pottery Barn targets consumers with a $75,000annual income level and above. Added Kurt Barnard, head ofBarnard's Retail Consulting Group: 'The upscale consumers can paymore for gas and not blink an eyelash.'"And the poor people? Let them eat cake. Oh, wait. They can't affordcake.
