spring just for Broadway Direct.
The year is just warming up according to the calendar. But theater buffs know that Broadway is
reaching a crescendo with splashy new musicals and gripping dramas opening up right throughthe end of April, just in time for the Tony Awards deadline. So it’s no surprise that books devotedto theater are blossoming as well. Here’s a roundup of the best titles that have just hit stores thisspring.
HAMILTON: THE REVOLUTION 
By Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeremy McCarter$40, Grand Central Publishing
Well, heck. You can’t get tickets to the show so you might as well get this extensive making-of
coffee table book. It contains the full libretto, including footnotes by Miranda, a complete historyof the groundbreaking musical, behind-the-scenes info, photos, and more. I mean, you’re stilllistening to the cast album obsessively, so at least now you have something to hold in your

THE SELECTED LETTERS OF ELIA KAZAN 
Edited by Albert J. Devlin$25, Vintage
It’s a compelling glimpse into the mind of one of the giants of theater and film. Stories about the
making of landmark works of the stage like A Streetcar Named Desire  and Death of a Salesman
are cheek by jowl with stories about classic films such as On the Waterfront  and East of Eden .
Kazan’s take on Marlon Brando and James Dean will pull many in; his take on the craft ofmounting a play will keep them turning the pages. Will we chart a person’s life in the future viatheir emails and texts? Maybe. But this is as good as Kazan’s autobiography, written on the fly
with passion and humor and intelligence. Learn more.
THE DARK LADY’S MASK
By Mary Sharratt$26, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt
Did William Shakespeare — that barely educated country bumpkin — actually write those globe-
spanning masterpieces? Who is the Dark Lady, the woman who haunts some of the greatestsonnets in history? Those are two of the greatest puzzles hovering over the life of the world’sforemost dramatist. Author Sharratt amusingly combines them both in this tantalizing novel of“What if?” In it, a cross-dressing poetess stumbles upon and falls hard for a penniless poetnamed William Shakespeare. They abscond to Italy and begin collaborating on comedies andtragedies that will shake the world of drama. When their romance ends, so does theircollaboration. With Shakespeare the public face of their achievement, he garners all the glory —and then taunts his onetime artistic partner with those sonnets. He should remember that hell
hath no fury. . . . Learn more.
ROMEO & JULIET
By William Shakespeare$7, Penguin Classics</p>
<p>Romeo & Juliet  is one of the most assigned plays in schools around the country, the perfect
introduction to the romantic, funny, rich, and tragic world of Shakespeare. The Pelican
Shakespeare books are one of the most acclaimed modern presentations of the plays of theBard since the line’s birth in the 1950s. This is just one of many new editions that the imprint isreleasing. Each comes with a new cover and the usual essays and notes putting the plays intothe context of Shakespeare’s time. They are handsome, portable, and a pleasure to read. Sure,you can download rough copies of all his plays. Maybe you already have some weighty tome onyour shelf containing all the collected works, the sort of edition you display but never actuallyopen. Yet there’s an undeniable pleasure in holding individual copies of R&J  and Hamlet  and
Macbeth  in your hands, dipping in when you’ve got a moment, carrying them with you
everywhere, making notes in the margins, and losing yourself on the page almost as much asyou can during a great performance. (Or, if you’re critic Harold Bloom, losing yourself even
more!) Learn more.
SUMMERLOST
By Ally Condie$17.99, Dutton Books for Younger Readers
English teacher turned bestselling novelist Condie has delivered one of the most anticipated
kids’ books of the year. It’s a bittersweet tale of Cedar, a girl slowly recovering from the accidentthat killed her father and brother. She’s spending the summer at Iron Creek, tentatively findingher way back into the world. And the safe space she discovers there, one that welcomes Cedarand gives her a newfound pleasure in life? It’s Summerlost, a renowned annual festival where
Cedar makes friends, finds work at a concession stand, and discovers the joys of theater. Learn
more.
ON BROADWAY
By Drew Hodges$45, Rizzoli
Savvy readers know the name Chip Kidd: He has designed some of the best book covers in
recent years, the rare artist of the form to become a household name. It’s no surprise he’swritten an introduction for this handsome work. Why? Because On Broadway explores the last20 years of theatrical history via the posters and imagery created in tandem with SpotCo, the</p>
<p>company founded by author Hodges. From working with the still grieving family of Jonathan
Larson on Rent  to the record-breaking revival of Chicago  and right up to the selling of the hip-
hop musical Hamilton , SpotCo has been in the thick of it. For many people, name a show and
the first image that pops to mind is the poster. On Broadway turns the creation of those posters
into a thumbnail sketch of the Great White Way over the past two decades. It includesanecdotes featuring everyone from stars including Nicole Kidman and Sting to theater legendssuch as Harvey Fierstein and Cherry Jones. And, of course, classic posters in all their glory.

WOMEN OF WILL
By Tina Packer$16, Vintage
If you ask us, playwright Eugene O’Neill was almost always  experimental. This anthology
focuses on key early works The Emperor Jones  (notably providing a great role for black actors
who sorely lacked them at the time), The Hairy Ape , and the one-acts set on board a ship,
known collectively as The S.S. Glencairn Plays.  It’s a useful look at one facet of a prolific career
best known for his lengthy tragedies. Learn more.
THE GREAT AMERICAN WHATEVER
By Tim Federle$17.99, Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers
True, this young-adult novel is actually about a gay teenager who is crazy about the movies, not
the theater. But it’s by Tim Federle, the author of the bestselling middle-grade books Better NateThan Never  and Five, Six, Seven, Nate,  both amusingly fanatical about the stage. So he’s
earned a lot of goodwill. This novel is aimed at slightly older teens and charts the reawakeningof Quinn, a teen sunk into depression and guilt from the death of his sister in a car accident. Ina whirlwind week, Quinn falls hard for another guy, gets his hair cut, cleans up his room and hislife, comes out, and realizes that while their dream of being the first great brother-sister team inmovie history may be gone for good, in fact it might have just been his  dream. And life is still
worth living. Filled with movie references and a passion for the arts any theater lover canappreciate, Federle delivers his usual breezy humor, but here with a new undercurrent of
maturity and sadness. Learn more.</p>
<p>THE 101 GREATEST PLAYS
By Michael Billington$26.95, Guardian Faber
Author Billington is as much a part of the U.K. theater scene as the National or Judi Dench. He
has lectured on the arts, published biographies of Harold Pinter and Peggy Ashcroft, and,above all, reviewed theater with passion and insight. So yes, while you or I or just about anyonecould whip up a list of “the 101 greatest plays,” you or I or just about anyone probably isn’t asinformed and ready to create a list worth reading as much as Billington is. (He’s been reviewingshows for nearly 50 years and seen about 9,000 productions . . . and counting.) Mind you, it’snot the list that really matters, choices that range from the ancient Greeks up to the present. It’sBillington’s passionate arguments and essays about what he’s selected and why that will informand enrage and delight — and likely send you off to read a few plays and make your own list in
response. Learn more.
THE COMPLETE BOOK OF LES MISÉRABLES
By Edward Behr$19.99, Arcade Publishing
Hamilton  is just the latest theatrical event to become a worldwide phenomenon. Les Misérables
was also a game-changing blockbuster that rewrote the rules of musical theater. That’s where
the comparisons end. Hamilton  began Off-Broadway and was acclaimed from day one. Les Miz
began in Paris and came to London, where the critics harrumphed at this glitzy, almost silly spinon Victor Hugo’s sprawling masterpiece. Hamilton  looked forward to hip-hop for musical
inspiration. Les Miz looked back to opera. Both have fans who are passionate, to say the least.For those who didn’t dream of missing the recent Broadway revival of Les Misérables , this
reissue of the making of that masterpiece contains the full libretto and the rags-to-riches story of
its unlikely success. Learn more.
PRODIGAL SON
By John Patrick Shanley$13.95, Theatre Communications Group</p>
<p>A new play by the author of Doubt  and the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Moonstruck  will
always be an event. When it’s set in a prestigious boarding school, is strongly autobiographical,
touches on everything from mentors to sexuality to the saving grace of education, and featuresa juicy central role any young actor would kill for, then it becomes essential. Actor TimothéeChalamet gave a career-making turn as the lead character and doubtless young actors all overthe country will be poring over the play, relishing his monologues and dreaming about what they
would do with a chance to play this part. Learn more.
SEX WITH SHAKESPEARE
By Jillian Keenan$25.99, William Morrow
Roger Ebert opened our eyes to the usefulness of acknowledging sexiness in film criticism. Too
often, the erotic is giggled over or mentioned quickly and almost with embarrassment. Ebertdemonstrated that the appeal of actors is so fundamental to enjoying the arts that ignoring it isfoolish. And the sooner you do acknowledge what turns you on, the sooner you can startthinking seriously about why and how it turns you on. Writer Keenan doesn’t know fromembarrassment, as her memoir makes clear. She’s written for countless outlets, from The NewYorker  and The New York Times  to Scientific American  and Playboy . Here, Keenan combines
her personal journey of realizing and accepting her own identity as a sexual masochist with aclose reading of Shakespeare’s plays. The result is genuine insight, from the (obvious) bondageand domination of The Taming of the Shrew  to the (less obvious) sexual masochism of Helena in
A Midsummer Night’s Dream to the (unexpected) possibility that King Lear  is a sexual predator.
