Errol Flynn 
Signature Collection **** Warner Bros., $59.92 ----
At $12 a film, this boxed set is 
one of the bargains of the year, 
thanks to very good to great 
Errol Flynn movies, all loaded 
with extras like newsreels, car足
toons and shorts. You get two 
classic pirate movies (1935's 
"Captain Blood" and 1940's 
"The Sea Hawk"), two solid 
westerns (including 1939's 
"Dodge City" with its epic bar足
room brawl), a top-notch cos足
tumer (1939's "The Private 
Lives of Elizabeth and Essex") 
and a very good brand-new 87-
minute documentary about 
Flynn. 
That 70s Show: 
Season1\vo ** Fox, $49.98 -----
As this mild, time-killer of a 
sitcom nears its end, season 
two reminds us of what a talent 
Topher Grace has always been, 
even with so-so material. No 
wonder he's graduated to good 
fUms like "P.S." and "In Good 
Company." Darned if he isn't 
this generation's Jack Lemmon. 
Also out: "Miracles: The 
Complete Series" (Shout, 
$49.98), the goofy "Space Ghost: 
Coast to Coast: Volume Three" 
(Warner Bros., $29.98) and the 
shoulder-pad heaven of 
"Dynasty: First Season" (Fox, 
$39.98). House of FlYing 
Daggers ' 
***1/2 Sony, $28.95 
This fUm is so visually 
stunning you'll swear 
God invented color just 
for director Zhang 
Yunou. And by 
stunning, we don't mean 
just the beautiful star 
Zhang Ziyi (no relation), 
who plays a blind spy in 
this rousing period 
action flick. Extras 
include a commentary 
track by the director and 
his muse, plus a 
substantial 45-minute 
making-of feature. Also 
out: the classic 1939 
adventure'tale "The 
Four Feathers" (MGM, 
$14.95). ' 
Devils on 
the Doorstep 
***1Iz HVE, $26.95 
Worthy of Kurosawa, this 
World War II fUm depicts timid 
villagers who are secretly 
forced to hide Japanese prison足
ers in occupied China. Witty 
and humane -until it becomes 
a devastating critique of war 
and revenge -this fUm is not 
to be missed. 
Meet the Fockers ** Universal, $29.98 
It's not as good as the original, 
but diverting if you're in the 
right mood. Still, this Ben Stiller 
movie is now the top-grossing 
live-action comedy in history. 
Why? One word: Babs. Barbra 
Streisand's first comedy in 24 
years was long overdue. She's 
one of the screen's best talents.
