            <p>Moral jello 
A UF board composed of faculty, students and ad-
o ministrative personnel recently released a document called 
· "Standard of Ethical Conduct For The University of 
Florida Community." It avoided using the phrase "moral 
conduct" and with good reason. 
Moral leadership is a difficult task in the best of times. 
No one wants to have the values of others imposed upon 
them and teachers are painfully aware' of this. Academia 
· has spent the last deCade bending over backwards to 
avoid such charges. 
As a result, children, graduate from grade school 
· without understanding the differences between democracy 
and other fotms of government, such as dictatorships and 
totalitarian systems. History books used in high school 
talk about the pilgrims coming to America but never men­
tion why they left their homes -religious persecution . 
So a place of higher learning is our last chance to en­
sure that education is not an ethically neutral experience. 
The "Standard Of Ethical Conduct" would seem to be an 
attempt to help -in that effort. 
We might have been concerned that these conservative 
times would have encQUraged the board to go too far and 
impose its values on the student body at large. Instead, it 
has delivered a four-page paper remarkable for how vague 
and tentative it manages. to be. A better name for it would 
be "Suggestions Of Ethical Conduct," for they are filling 
up the ethical vacuum of UF with moral jello. 
The strongest words are reserved for cheating. We can 
rest assured that UF is unequivocally opposed to such 
practices and finds them inappropriate to learning. "Hones­
ty, integrity and caring are essential qualities of an educa­
tional institution," it states in the first line. 
In addition, a full page is devoted to explaining how 
cheating is bad and nobody should do it. In contrast, the 
thorny, complex issue of relations between religious, ra­
cial and cultural minorities is covered in two lines. The 
problems of women and sexual relationships take all of 
four lines. 
Well, we know what UF says about cheating, but how 
does it act? The most visible area in which it operates 
that calls for honesty and integrity is the athletic program. 
UF hired Charley Pell to -coach the Gators in football 
for the '79 season. He had been the head of the program 
at Clemson and that team showed substantial improve­
ment during his stay there. Pell bailed out before the 
NCAA slapped Clemson with probation and gladly went 
to UFo 
During his first season, UF was in such poor shape that 
its record was O-to-l. Remarkably, Pell turned the team 
around with his tried and true coaching tactics. In the '80 
.season -his second year -the Gators were 8-4 and tri-
~' umphed in the Tangerine Bowl. 
When he was fired in '84, UF was in the middle of the 
first of the two best years in the program's history. Coin­
cidentally, the NCAA waS well on its way to putting UF 
:,.-:' on probation, just like Clemson. 
Who says cheaters never prosper? Tomorrow we'l1 look 
at what the "Suggestions of Ethical Conduct" says about 
women, blacks, gays and other minorities, as well as al­
cohol and drug abuse and academic freedom. Then we'll 
tell you how UF is really behllving.</p>
<p>-l\£0ra1 Jello II 
An education without values il! an education withou t.::: 
value. With that in mind, we spoke yesterday about the re­
lease of the "Suggestions of Ethical Conduct" and our 
football program's hone.M)' and integrity. As the probes of 
a federal grand jury and theDEA overshadow our basket­
ball program, let's look at the rest of the dOCument. 
n the preamble, it states, "A university is a place 
·where self-expression, voicing d.¥agreement, and challeng­
ing outmoded customs and beliefs are prize4 and honored." 
That's all well and good, but how has UF behaved? In 
1987, a little incident called Chambergate occurrCd. 
Through transcripts of a taped conversation, it was re­
vealed that John Schroepfer, the president of the Gaines­
ville Chamber--of Commerce, boasted about how Marshall 
Criser would silence two professors who were adamantly 
pro-envirollDlCftl. Schroepfer eve~tually said he ex agger­
-ated the conversation and resigned. 
-Regardless of Criser's role in the affair, he failed to 
take two simple actions that would have shown he "prized 
the voicing of disagreement." One, while repeatedly deny­
ing the charges, he never stated that he was in full support 
of academic freedom. Two, Criser never contacted the two 
professors named in any way to assure them that the sto­
ries weren't true. How would you feel if the newspapers 
were blaring that your boss had promised to silence you 
and he never bothered to pick up the phone to say it ain't 
so? 
On alcohol and drugs, the paper says -in full -"The 
use of alcohol and drugs can have a negative impact on 
judgments and reaction, health and safety, and may lead 
to legal complications as well." The document then goes 
on to talk obliquely about the role of the university and 
the university community, but such vagueness is odd. 
Why not say, "The University conde~s the abuse of al­
cohol and the use of drugs as utterly inappropriate to a 
learning environment. It will not be tolerated from stu­
dents, faculty or administration." This is the one area in 
~hich UF could have talked tough without offending any­
e. The fact that. it hems and haws even here is telling. 
-Don't blink while reading or you may miss the paper's 
.. take on minorities. It states, "One of the major benefits of 
"higher education and mefubership in the University c.om­
:munity is greater knowledge of and respect for other 
groups, religious, racial, and cultural." 
.. That's nice, but the truth isn't. The percentage of black 
faculty on campus is 2.2 percent and has been for the past 
10 years. Women are paid less than men any way you cut 
it. 
... And as for dealing with any organization that "upsets 
the delicate balance of communal living," where was UF \ 
when Student Government cut funding for the UF Lesbian . 
and (jay Society and one student senator wondered why 
.they should spend students' money on "a bunch of fags?..'J" 
If they had said the same abollt blacks, you can imagine 
there would have been some action, but apparently gays 
aren't organized well enough 10 deserve equal rights. 
Moral leadership is a difficult and delicate task that the 
",Suggestions of Ethical Conduct" doesn't even begin to 
rilake easier. Anyone reading it would find vagueness ~d 
apathyy not the guidance that is so strongly needed. And 
-mest eloquently worded document won't make up for 
w~ ~fi~. .</p>
