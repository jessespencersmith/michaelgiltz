Andy Pettitte Fails to Take
Responsibility
Posted February 18, 2008 | 03:48 PM (EST)

Andy Pettitte is in the midst of a press conference discussing the abuse of steroids
and HGH in baseball and his personal role in breaking the law. Sadly, he remains incapable of
saying two simple words: "I cheated." Andy again tries to justify his actions as not that bad and notreally cheating because he was only trying to recover from an injury, "Anyone that has followed mycareer knows that I have battled elbow problems the entire time. Again, like I said before, I nevertook this to get an edge on anyone. I did this to try to get off the DL and to do my job."
Remarkably, even in the context of religion and his faith, Andy continues to see his breaking of
federal law and besmirching baseball as morally ok. "I felt like it was the right thing to do in my
heart," insists Andy. "As far as my faith, I felt good about it."
Huh? Andy says -- rightly -- that kids shouldn't do
what he did. But if what he did was morally fine andhe did it for the right reasons, is that only becauseunder a technicality it's against federal law andagainst the morals clause of baseball? Andy cheated,pure and simple. But asked point blank, he says
again, "Do I think I'm a cheater? No, I don't. Was it stupid? Yeah." He also said, "If people thinkI'm lying, then they should call me a cheater."
Maybe the words to describe Andy are "in denial." Here's why.1. Using HGH to recover from an injury gives you an edge over other teams -- It gives your team an
edge over other teams who have pitchers that are injured but refuse to cheat and break the law inorder to recover more quickly.
2. Using HGH to recover from an injury gives you an edge over your own teammates -- Pitchers are
working together to win games but they're also in competition. If Andy is injured, that givesanother pitcher a chance to start a major league game. It might even mean the chance for a minorleaguer to come up to the majors. And that means another minor leaguer might get a chance to

$40,000jump from Double A ball to Triple A ball to fill their slot. The number of people that Andy cheated
by potentially pitching when he should have been injured is hard to estimate but large. It also
affects the people Andy faced on another team. Maybe an opposing pitcher who faced the guy he
should have faced if Andy hadn't cheated would have won a game and changed their season. Or
they would have lost it and that might have meant a minor leaguer came up and had a shot st the
show. Again, it's impossible to know how many people that Andy cheated but it's many.
3. Using HGH for a short period of time guarantees the likelihood of getting caught via testing is
nil -- unlike steroids, there's no test yet for HGH in baseball. Therefore, suggesting that his use of
HGH instead of the far riskier steroids (as far as getting caught is concerned) is hardly more
admirable.
4. Recovering from an injury fast brings personal glory, increases your market value and benefits
you in every way -- every player wants to help their team win games. But cheating is no way toreach that goal. You're cheating if you're using steroids to build muscle mass. You're cheating if youtrip up an opponent when no one is looking. And you're cheating if you illegally use drugs in orderto recover more quickly.
5. Andy tries to pretend it wasn't technically illegal to use HGH -- "If it was illegal in baseball, I
wouldn't have done it," he insists. Andy, it was AGAINST FEDERAL LAW. Baseball has a moralsclause -- anything that brings disgrace to the game of baseball is against the rules. Cheating ischeating.
6. Andy says it hurt that people suspected he used steroids -- Why? Using steroids is cheating.
Using HGH is cheating. Period. Cheating for years is worse? Sure. But Andy cheated twice over a
several year period out of "desperation" as he put it. How he could be desperate, break the law and
yet still believe he wasn't cheating is hard to swallow.
7. Andy says he should have had a prescription -- According to the New York Times , HGH is
NEVER prescribed to professional athletes to recover form injuries. The rare instances in which it
is legal to prescribe HGH (and it is the rare drug that specifically can NOT be used for anything
other than what it is specifically approved for) include dwarfism, and wasting disease associated
with AIDS. Andy is deeply confused about HGH if he thinks he could go to a doctor and get a
prescription of it to fix a balky elbow.
I'd love for Andy to find some religious counselor, some ethicist, some moral leader who would tell
us that breaking federal law, illegally obtaining a drug to recover from injuries faster than yourteammates or your opponenets and getting a shot late at night from a shady fitness trainer ISN'Tcheating and is in fact a-ok by them and in their opinion, by God. Maybe one reason he can stay indenial is because he's under no threat of being suspended for even a day. And that's one more blackmark on the failed, disastrous legacy of Bud Selig and baseball.
Andy, you cheated. Pure and simple. Please, please wake up to that simple fact.

You're not bothered that he broke federal law and risked his health in a stupid, ineffective

You know, it is possible to discuss and debate and take a stand on global warming and thewar in Iraq and the national debt and rampant cheating in baseball and universal health careand a host of other issues. In some ways, they're linked: a refusal to accept evidence (thosewho insist they're not convinced Clemens cheated), a refusal to accept science (those whoinsist we don't know if these drugs can help), a willingness to cut corners (cheating isrampant, everyone does it, so just accept it) and a refusal to accept responsibility (Clemens
contradicting himself from moment to moment and Pettitte insisting God would be delighted
with Pettitte's desire to break the law and risk his health to win a baseball game). Clemensthinks he can just keep repeating a lie over and over until people get bored and move on just

like Bush did. Facts matter. Ethics matter. If you ignore cheating in baseball and sports, wy
then you'll be more likely to accept it in politics and war. Presidents lie, of course, so what'sthe big deal? I think it's a big deal.

It is old news, and baseball was allowed to let this happen because the owners weremaking tons of money, god was in his heaven and all was right with the world. Nowif the Congress was as on top of Iran-Contra, the outing of a covert agent and thosekinds of matters, then their pursuit of cheating ballplayers might have a greaterlegitimacy. 
The use of steroids and HGH went on for years even though a casual observer had
to know that something was going on when you see previously skinny men all of a
sudden bursting uniform seams. Players performing at a level that was not justifiedby anything they had done earlier in their careers. 
So who had their heads buried in the sand all this time? And if they find a way to
punish all these players, do the owners, team physicians, and all those charged withmaintaining the integrity of the game get off scott-free? Remember the bottle labeled"andro" in McGuire's locker? 
Sport, particularly baseball has always celebrated its cheaters, from Ty Cobb's
spikes to Gaylord Perry's spitballs and all the others, so it seems like days late anddollars short on this matter. 
Quite frankly, I suggest that stolen elections are a slightly more important matter.

Athletes cheat. It's the nature of being a great athlete, to find a competitive edge that others won't
pursue. As a fan, I expect the players on teams I root for to do whatever is necessary to get that edge,including, if necessary, "cheat" to get off the disabled list. And since the usage of HGH (unlike roids) isa malum prohibitum violation of the rules, much like a college athlete taking money under the table, I'mnot bothered by what Petitte did, even though I'm not an Astros or Yankees fan.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
No Steve, you are completely wrong. Yes, some athletes are like Ty Cobb and despitemassive talent they will still clobber and pummel and take advantage of every opportunity
whether legal or not to gain an edge. But most are not. People don't breathlessly repeat
stories of how they were at the Super Bowl and watched their favorite quarterback steal a
signal or sneak over the line or somehow break the rules to win. They don't say, hey
remember when we were at the Daytona 500 and our favorite racer smashed the machine of
his opponent into pieces when the referees weren't looking? Gosh, that was great. it is in the
nature of a great athlete to play a game beautifullyand with extraordinary skill, whether you'rePele or Babe Ruth or Roger federer or Michael Jordan. What stories do you have of MichaelJordoan cheating? None. And if he did, he would be less admired. Your cynical "everyonecheats" attitude isn't borne out by any evidence, happily. Athletes who cheat are disgraced,not celebrated. Coaches who put winning first are controversial, not beloved.

If he doesn't realize what he's done is wrong already, he never will. No counselor or religious leader is
likely to make him see reason.

The day he sees reason, his career is done. Or vice versa. That is the whole point, reason
has never really been a part of their lives. I remember when he left the Yanks because hethought that he had not been acknowledged by Steinbrenner after a great performance. Was
George acting out of character? No. Was he paying Andy a handsome salary? Seems to me,
at any rate.
They are athletes. If you ever have to deal with a brain surgeon, you'd like to have one at
least as skilled as Andy has been. You could aim higher, but good is good. They just are not
for where one goes looking for more than just a good game performance. When all is said
and done, as you said, MG, I still got bills to pay.

You're right, of course.

on my drive to work (Beacon NY) I was listening to Boomer Esiason's show in WFAN. The one thing hepredicted we'd hear from Pettitte was the words "God" or "my faith" etc. As if mouthing the wordsmakes you a Christian and gets you a free pass from questioning. Unreal.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Also very true. It was really remarkable to hear Andy insist he had good reasons torepeatedly lie for years and then finally insist that he actually did nothing wrong and God
would approve of it. Good to know God approves of doping.
