9/10/2005 11:05:00 PMNew York Times columnist David Brooks is ready for the "silverlining" of Katrina, basically a plan to rebuild the city but makingsure that middle class people and poor people are culturallyintegrated, which will lift 'em up, don't you know. How aboutjust getting people a decent job at a decent wage so someoneworking 40 hours a week can have health care and feed theirkid?Then Brooks throws in this dismissive kicker:We can't win a grandiose war on poverty.Actually, Brother Brooks, we CAN. Clinton attacked poverty with thesame vigor that Bush attacks taxes that keep the super wealthy frombeing even super wealthier. Poverty dropped under Clinton and fewerchildren went to bed hungry at night. Clinton also got people offwelfare rolls and gave them their dignity.Maybe what Brooks meant to say was that BUSH can't win the war onpoverty. That's certainly true: lost amidst the terrible news was thefact that more and more Americans have fallen into poverty. Thenumber of people living in poverty has increased every year of theBush reign -- the increase has hit 17% and rising. So obviously BUSHcan't win the war on poverty. But of course he isn't even trying.
