Q.J 
Z Six Feet Under: Complete SeCond Season * *'/, 
HBO, $99.98 
Rarely has a fine drama fallen so fast, with the show's subtle 
exploration of character turning into a typical soap in the second 
season. It's all made palatable by a terrific cast (led by Peter 
Krause, Michael C. Hall and Frances Conroy) and guest stars such 
as Patricia Clarkson. Extras include a 20-minute featurette on 
creating those dead bodies and five audio commentaries. 
The Film Noir 
Collection: Vol. 1 
***'/' Warner Bros., $49.92 ....:......------
A top-notch bundling of 
otherwise unrelated noir gems. 
You get B-movie classic "Gun 
Crazy" (1949); Dick Powell as 
Philip Marlowe in 1945's 
"Murder My Sweet," John 
Huston's seedy "The Asphalt 
Jungle" (1950); Robert 
Mitchum's 1947 "Out Of The 
Past" and the 1949 gritty boxing 
drama "The Set-Up." All with 
audio commentaries, including 
"The Set~Up," which has a 
sterling one by director Robert 
Wise and Martin Scorsese. 
Big Top Pee-Wee 
**'/, Paramount, $49.99 
Get ready for a 
Pee-Wee 
Herman 
revival, whose 
misunderstood 
second movie 
is finally out on 
DVD. While it 
can't hold a 
candle to the gentle sweetness 
of "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure," 
this 1988 comedy about a 
traveling circus is more attuned 
to Paul Reubens' twisted adult 
humor. No extras, sadly. Later 
this year, look for season one of 
the deliciously wacky TV show 
"Pee-Wee's Playhouse." The Charlie Chan 
Chanthology 
* MGM,$69.96 
What you get here are the 
dregs: low-budget releases 
after the original star (Warner 
Oland) died, starring the 
second Chan (Sidney Toler) 
and made for a minor studio in 
1944 and 1945 after 20th 
Century Fox had run the series 
into the ground. Not one of 
these six forgettable movies is 
over 65 minutes long, so they 
could have easily fit on two or 
three discs instead of six and 
sold for maybe $30. No extras, 
of course. Just dreadful. 
Independent's Day 
***'/, Docu Rama, $26.95 
This brief documentary by 
director Marina Zenovich lets 
those who've never been to the 
Sundance Film Festival get an 
inside look at the event. 
Astutely edited, using shots of 
Sundance as atmosphere, it 
features interviews with the 
major players. Robert Redford, 
Roger Ebert, Neil LaBute and 
Steven Soderbergh are all here, 
talking about the politics of the 
fest and how indie filmmakers 
have gone from making 
heartfelt projects to wondering 
if their movie is a "Sundance" 
film. Extras include outtakes 
from the interviews.</p>
