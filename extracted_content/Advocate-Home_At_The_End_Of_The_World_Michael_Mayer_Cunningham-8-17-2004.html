Cutting Colin 
As A Home at the End of the World hits 
the screen, the filmmakers talk about 
slimming down the novel-and axing 
Colin Farrell's nude scene By MICHAEL GILTZ 
Michael Mayer lmew he want­
ed to make Pulitzer Prize­
winner Michael Cunning­
ham's 1990 novel A Home at 
the End of the World his fiIm-
directing debut. So he turned to an old 
acquaintance he lmew would be penect 
to adapt it Michael Cunningham. 
"We'd never really spent any time to­
gether, just the two of us; it had always 
been a dinner party or a group," says 
Mayer, an out theater director who won 
the Tony for Ttwroughly Modern MiUie 
and is now working on a Broadway re­
vival of Arthur Miller's After the Fall. 
After months of working together on 
Home, the two were so well-matched 
that they were finishing each other's sen­
tences, Mayer adds. Not that that made it 
any easier to adapt Cunningham's 
decades-spanning novel about Jonathan, 
a lonely gay man; his eager-to-please but 
sexually ambiguous pal, Bobby; and 
Clare, their wacky New York friend. 
"How do you get five dozen eggs into 
a shoebox? " says Cunningham about the 
challenges they faced. "What can be cut 
away? Once I understood how much was 
going to be cut, I was fine. If anything, I 
started to get into an ecstasy of cutting 
and cut too much." Among the deletions: The boyfriend Jonathan winds up with 
in the book. 
The cast certainly helped Cunning­
ham and Mayer focus. Dallas Roberts, 
who plays Jonathan, just "got better and 
better and better [during auditions]," 
says Mayer, "and by the time of his last 
audition, I literally couldn't imagine any­
one else doing his role." And as Clare, 
Robin Wright Penn "has a kind of amaz­
ing sobriety," he says. "When you're 
dealing with her as a person, she can be 
absolutely delightful, but you always 
feel she's a straight shooter. You get the 
real thing. Despite her remarkable beau­
ty, you can see a life lived on her face." 
Then there's Colin Farrell, as Bobby. 
"Colin has a depth of soul-if that's 
something he's acting, it's an extraordi­
nary bit of acting," says Cunningham , 
speaking from the tower in Italy's Tus­
cany region, where he's finishing his next 
noveL "1 think he's a wondeIful actor, but 
there's just something about Colin [as a 
personj. There's a moment when he 
looks at Dallas when they're sitting out 
on the porch and Jonathan is really 
aware he has HIV and Colin is insisting 
that he doesn't, and you can just see how 
much he wants it not to be true and how 
deeply he knows that it is true. What 
THE ADVOCATE I"" I AUGUST 17, 2004 happens on his face and in his eyes is not 
just beautiful but exactly what I imag­
ined for Bobby." 
What Cunningham and Mayer didn't 
imagine was that having a hot Hollywood 
property like Farrell-next appearing in 
Oliver Stone's blockbuster about bisexual 
conqueror Alexander the Great-would 
make every element of their film so con­
troversial. Which explains why a casual 
moment in which Farrell is seen nude 
was axed after initial press screenings. 
"This is exactly why we changed it," says 
Mayer. (And no, he adds, don't look for it</p>

"Colin Farrell has a depth of soul" in the role of sexually ambiguous Bobby, 
says novelist Michael Cunningham. 
on the DVD.) "It seemed way too inter­
esting to people who should be concen­
trating on the characters and the story. It 
became distracting. It took away from 
the work, and Colin felt really uncom­
fortable. He was getting more questions 
about his dick than his performance. We 
came to a mutual agreement." 
Cunningham, who has been in a rela­
tionship for 17 years and out his entire 
career, adds, "You know how Hollywood is. The same people who described Colin 
as 'that guy who does action movies' are 
just as likely to start talking about him as 
'that guy who plays bisexuals.' This, of 
course, is their problem, not Colin's. But 
it would be silly to deny that it's some­
thing for him to deal with." •
