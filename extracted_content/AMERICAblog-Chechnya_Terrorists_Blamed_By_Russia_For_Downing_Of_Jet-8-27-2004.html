8/27/2004 02:21:00 PMYes, it looks like Russia has found some evidence (traces ofexplosive) in the wreckage of at least one of those two downed jets.Also, no one has come forward to claim the bodies of unidentifiedChechnyan women (one in each plane) that have been set aside. (Allother victims have been spoken for.) The conclusion? It looks likeChechnyan terrorists. Well, we know what Bush would do -- invadeGeorgia.
