6/08/2005 09:24:00 AMNo wonder Bush likes to pretend there is still a debate onclimate change. It's easy to do when Bush has been doctoringgovernment reports on global warming to gut the scientific factand increase doubt. According to the NYT,A White House official who once led the oil industry'sfight against limits on greenhouse gases hasrepeatedly edited government climate reports in waysthat play down links between such emissions andglobal warming, according to internal documents.In handwritten notes on drafts of several reportsissued in 2002 and 2003, the official, Philip A. Cooney,removed or adjusted descriptions of climate researchthat government scientists and their supervisors,including some senior Bush administration officials,had already approved. In many cases, the changesappeared in the final reports.The dozens of changes, while sometimes as subtle asthe insertion of the phrase "significant andfundamental" before the word "uncertainties," tend toproduce an air of doubt about findings that mostclimate experts say are robust.I love that the guy in charge of developing environmental policy wasa lackey of the oil industry. Meanwhile, scientific groups from aroundthe world (including the US National Academy of Sciences) justreleased an unprecedented statement reiterating the obvious: climatechange is real, the evidence is overwhelming and the if we don't actnow the effects could be catastrophic.Bush's record on combatting this danger? Not so good.Between 1990 and 2002, the carbon dioxide emissions ofthe US increased by 13 per cent, which on their own weregreater than the combined cut in emissions that will beachieved if all Kyoto countries hit their targets, said LordMay of Oxford, the president of the Royal Society.
