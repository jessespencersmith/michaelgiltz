            <p>What I really hate are cas­
settes," says Neil Ten­
nant of the Pet Shop 
Boys, "it's really the shit­
tiest format that's ever 
been. They all play at the wrong speed 
and they tangle up and the packaging's 
horrible. I can't think of anything good 
to be said for prerecorded cassettes." 
Of course, CDs create their own 
problems. When Tennant and his part­
ner Chris Lowe prepared their latest 
album for release, they faced down the 
temptation of excess. 
"We had extra songs," Tennant 
says. "We could have made Very 70 min-And then of course you get weird 
things like those Beatles albums [the 
Red and Blue compilations] coming 
out on two CDs. It's not even 
dear old EMI's fault, actually, 
it's the Beatles. That really is 
just crazy." 
Though not, perhaps, as 
crazy as the obstacles Tennant 
and Lowe faced in 1981, when they 
met at a stereo equipment store and 
began writing together. Five years later, 
success arrived-dramatically-with 
"West End Girls," a smash hit in the 
U.S. and Great Britain. Lead singer 
Tennant, formerly a journalist, dived lapsed Catholic and was probably des­
tined to be so, if only for artistic reasons. 
He laments the passing of the Latin 
Mass, which changed the weekly 
ceremony from a highly dramatic 
and mysterious affair into some­
thing rather mundane and ordi­
nary. And the music! 
"The Catholics in Britain and 
With Their Hot New Album Out, America have the worst music," moans 
Tennant. "If you're a Church of England 
member or a Protestant, then you have 
very lovely hymns. But the Catholics have 
these terrible hymns. And they never sing 
anyway. Or even worse they have these 
folk masses with people playing guitars 
and flutes and that l"eally ... I find that 
unbearable. And consequently on that 
rare occasion when I've been to mass in 
utes if we'd wanted. But that's too long. I 
think 40 to 50 minutes is a good length 
for any piece of music. Many sym­
phonies, for instance, aren't longer than 
45 or 50 minutes. Obviously, there are 
exceptions, but a lot of self-indulgence 
goes on. For instance, Erotica by Madon­
na; I think maybe that's an album that's 
too long. And has anyone really gotten to 
know both the Guns n' Roses CDs? Even 
when you get something [worthwhile] 
like Prince's Sign 0' the Times, which is 
two CDs, you never quite come to grips 
with it as well as you do Purple Rain." 
Not all lengthy CDs are bad, Ten­
nant hastens to add, the Pet Shop Boys' 
very own Discography naturally being the 
first example that springs to mind. 
"Our greatest hits album was one 
CD with 18 tracks and I think it's great 
you can get them all on," he says. "But 
that's different because you kind of 
know the songs to start with. The Chaps From England Take Off 
into the role of the quotable, knowing 
pop star while Lowe played the club­
hopping dance fiend. When a follow-up 
single was titled "Opportun ities (Let's 
Make Lots of Money)," it seemed clear: 
The Pet Shop Boys were a one-hit 
wonder and they knew it. File the 
album somewhere near Kajagoogoo or 
Naked Eyes and ignore them. And why 
not? They ignored us in their videos. In 
everyone, the lanky fellow stared 
glumly into the camera while the other 
chap looked pointedly away, as if he 
were thinking, this can't possibly last. 
But it did. They continued to turn 
out hits like "Domino Dancing," "Left 
to My Own Devices," and "It's a Sin," 
songs of increasing complexity and emo­
tional power. The last of these-a melo­
dramatic example of Catholic guiJt-was 
especially memorable. Tennant is a recent years, I'm in a bad mood thinking 
about how terrible the music is." 
By drawing on such personal themes 
and expanding their musical palette 
beyond the dance floor, the Pet Shop 
Boys' albums kept getting better and bet­
ter until suddenly there was BehavioT-a 
combination of subtle lyrics and sweeping 
arrangements that garnered a pile of 
glowing reviews. They'd done it. Along 
with John Mellencamp and perhaps one 
or two others, the Pet Shop Boys had 
managed the difficult trick of becoming 
serious, important artists aftel" achieving 
massive commercial success. ;;;

<p>have thought of several years ago. I'm 
really pleased with the lyric. But then I 
also feel pleased with "One and One 
Make Five," which is what we call a Kylie 
Minogue song-it's a very simple pop 
song, kind of verging on banal. 
"If there's been a change, it's been 
an evolution toward maybe a greater 
sophistication. But it's a musical and in 
many ways a pl'oduction sophistication. 
And we Imow we're getting better." 
Along the way, they've also managed 
to coax Dusty Springfield out of semi­
retirement with "What Have I Done to 
Deserve This?," produce an album for 
Liza Minnelli, and give Boy George's 
career a boost with "The Crying Game." 
Even their more selfless acts paid 
off handsomely. "We were doing an 
AIDS benefit concert in Manchester," 
Tennant says, "and we decided to end 
the show with a cover. Sometimes you 
get sick of just doing your own songs. 
We were going to do "Fool on the Hill," 
but it didn't sound good. And then Chris 
came in the next day and played me "Go 
West" by the Village People. I thought 
it was horrible actually; to be honest, 
their version of it sounds pretty cheesy. 
But Chris obviously saw the potential. 
And then it went down so well-it 
sounded very us; it really sounded very 
Pet Shop Boys." 
Very Pet Shop Boys, indeed. ot 
only is "Go West" the duo's biggest 
European hit in years, it serves as the 
striking finale to their latest CD, a worthy 
successor to the much lauded Behaviol'. 
Unfortunately, there won't be a successor 
to the "Performance" concert tour (now 
out on video). That highly theatrical 
show was a bacchanalian extravaganza 
that took even Tennant by surprise, when 
he saw the video. 
"I was quite shocked," Tennant says 
drolly. "Well, I wasn't shocked really, but I 
was thinking, 'God, all that was going on 
behind us, I had no idea.' The dancers 
tended to get more carried away as the 
tour went on, until it became completely 
obscene by the end, I think." 
Many reviewers commented on how 
flamboyant and frankly gay the concert 
was, but Tennant doesn't see it that way. 
"The stage show certainly had a sex­
ual presence, but I wouldn't really classify 
it as gay. There was quite a lot of hetero­
sexual stuff going on there, even some 
lesbianism for that matter. I think we 
kind of covered all the bases," he says, 
dissolving into laughter. 
Still, at some point in their career it 
became clear the Pet Shop Boys fancied East End boys perhaps a 
bit more than West End 
girls. Certainly, the best 
tracks on Very deal with 
this: "Can You Forgive 
Her?" is about a young 
man who's gay but can't 
admit it, "To Speak Is a 
Sin" paints a vivid por­
trait of the bar scene, 
and "Young Offender" 
details the relationship 
between an older and 
younger man. Yet Ten­
nant doesn't see any 
great leap forward in 
terms of openness and 
his objections hardly 
show a concern for 
image-just bemuse­
ment over all the fuss. 
"It's really become 
the focus of reviews in 
America, which is very 
interesting," says Ten­
nant. "But I don't think PET SHOP BOYS

And it's actually not the

before we even had a

always written about

this album is any more or 
less gay than any other thing we've done. 
I really don't want to speak to just one 
audience and I've never wanted us to be 
classified as a gay group. I just don't like 
the narrowness or the ghettoizing that 
assumes you're from one audience or 
talking to one audience. with the Smiths. It's all 
there at the start and it's all there at the 
end. And I was quite interested to read 
that because that's what I think of the Pet 
Shop Boys.".
