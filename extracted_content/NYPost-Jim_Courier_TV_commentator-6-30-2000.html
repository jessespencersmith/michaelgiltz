            <p>Nice return! 
Courier's a 
top seed in 
the booth ~ 
By MICHAEL GILTZ {, ( 1 0 l.)<i 
GREAT tennis stars don't al­
ways make great commenta­
tors. 
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors 
and Martina Navratilova all took 
a shot at it with middling ·t<>-poor 
results. 
But Jim Courier. who just re­
tired from his 13-year career on 
the courts last month, could be 
the most promising addition to 
the broadcast booth since bad-boy 
John McEnroe stunned TV audi­
ences "ith his wannth and astute 
insight into the game. 
Courier mnde his debut as a 
commentator this week at Wimb­
ledon and has already started to 
make friends. 
Usually paired with sports­
caster Marv Albert during TNT's 
ooon-t0-6 p:m. broadcasts. Coud­
er's famous dry humor is already 
scoring points. 
In his first days in the booth. 
the 29·year-old has referred to 
players hitting the ball "with au­
thority!" -a teasing reference to 
one of Albert's signature NBA 
calls -and had fun with the fan 
frenzy surrounding up-and-com­
ing American Jan-Michael Gam­
bill, a handsome athlete who 
creates a stir just by chunbring his 
shirt. 
Comp~l.Iisons to McEnroe are 
hardly far fetched. 
In 1992. Courier was the first 
American to reach No. 1 since 
McEnroe held the spot seven 
years earlier.

<p>Tennis great makes nice return 
Courier ultImately garnered 
four Grand Slams and won him· 
~ld a noble spot in Davis Cup 
hi31ory, with one of the all-time 
great matches last summer ver· 
sus Britain's Greg Rusedski. 
But a seemingly endless string 
of injuries and unsatisfying re­
sults once he got back into form 
are probably good reasons he's 
decided to change careers. 
-I'd thought about it for years 
a3 something I'd like to do if I 
had the opportunity/' says Cou­
rier. Then fatc stepped in. 
-It was eerie, actually. I talked 
to my agents about (doing TV 
commentary I and they talked to 
me about what it would invoke 
and what tournaments I might 
bt..> interested in doing. 
-The \'cry next day. TNT called 
them about Wimhledon." he 
:::uys. 
Raised in Dade City. Fla. Cou­
rier was part of the gencrntion 
tlut produced Pcte Sampras. 
Andre Agassi. and ~tich:ll'l 
Chang. A city court::;, rough-.md­
tumble gam{'r. C()urler li)ughl 
for every point (/ fa Connors: But unlike other players. he 
had a well-rounded life. 
Courier taught himself French 
on tour and always made a point 
of exploring the ci tics he was 
playing in. A fan of golf and 
baseball (especially the Cincin­
nati Reds), Courier also has <1 
passion for music and plays the 
guitar and drums, 
So when the tennis ended, Cou­
rier was not al a loss fol' wh3l to 
do next. 
Still, being part of the media 
poses some interesting ironies. 
Just as McEnroe tC1TOriZed 
umpires on the court. Courier 
was known for his sharp tongu~ on' the court which he used on 
reporters who were either ill-in­
formed or mean-spirited. 
"That was earlier in nw C::J.r('Cr 
that 1 would get di:,coul:aged by 
that stuff," says Courier, who 
never really had a had image. In 
fact. his sarcastic replie:; to 
dumb qucstions wcre hilanou3 
-so rcp{Jrtcrs still IU\'cd speak­
ing with him. 
From his own experience aT.d 
watching analy:,ts in other 
:-;port:'\, COUI;cr knows Wh31 he 
doc:-:n't like. "I don't like it when people 
take shois at players who don't 
W3ITont it. 1 didn't like it when 
they took shots at lIIe if I was 
trying," 
And Courier knows what he 
likes. 
"I wanl to tell things from a 
player's perspective." he says, 
"things people don't know in gen­
eral. 
"'I \\'ant to talk about the way 
the grass courts change over the 
course of a tournament; lhe way 
the balls have gotten heavier 
and hea\'ier here at Wimbledon 
in the last six years and how it's 
amazing Pete keeps \\;nning 
when they change the variables, 
"Not cn'rybody knows that. 
"And if I'm watching some 
other sport l'm nol so well 
~choo led in. I like to know that. 1 
like to know Tiger has switched 
golf balls 3nd won his lir;:;t two 
tournaments with it." 
1\'ike probably wants you to 
know that, too. 
"They lind that vcry interest­
ing," bu~hs Courier. "I don't 
think 1'it1eist docs. though," Courier -playing the baseline in his playing heyday -has teamed 
up with Marv Albert for his commentating debut at Wimbledon ,</p>
