Theater: "Rotten" By Name, Naughty By Nature;
Bedlam In Jane Austen's World; A Lion In Winter

Sometimes you see a show because of the reviews or to discover new
talent. Other times, you just want to check up on old friends -- how are
they and what are they up to? Live theater is pretty special. Unlike moviesand TV and books, when you experience this art you are actually in theroom with many of the artists involved. Tom Cruise doesn't actually come
into your living room when you pop in a BluRay of Born On The Fourth Of
July. The only similar experience is getting to hear music performed by an
artist in concert and even then there's a huge difference between U2 atan arena show and an intimate Off Broadway setting. So here are some
old friends: a hit musical just a few weeks from celebrating its first year
on Broadway, the very welcome return of a delightful Jane Austenadaptation by the theater troupe Bedlam and the great actor Len Cariou
combining some Shakespearean soliloquies with show tunes.
SOMETHING ROTTEN  *** out of ****

SOMETHING ROTTEN  *** out of ****
ST. JAMES THEATRE
Last April, I was about to see Something Rotten  when I ate something
rotten. A 24-hour bug or food poisoning or something waylaid me the
night of the final post-opening date for critics.
[Those deemed not important enough to see the show before it debuts
but lucky enough to get to see it anyway are dubbed "second nighters"
instead of "first nighters" and are offered a slot right after a show hasTheater: "Rotten" By Name, Naughty By Nature; Bedlam In Jane Austen's World; A Lion In Winter</p>
<p>officially opened. Miss a "first night" date and you might be able to
squeeze in right after it has been reviewed. Miss "second night" and
you're out of luck. There's no twelfth night option. I know; boo-hoo -- Iget to see Broadway shows! Just explaining.]
I really did consider going that night despite being woozy because I didn't
want to miss it. Worse comes to worse, I thought if I threw up in my seat,
I could stand up, loudly proclaim, "That was rotten!" and storm out. Notpolite, but surely in keeping with the amusing ad campaign for the show
and its saucy nature. The audience might even think it was planned! Then
I thought, "maybe not," since merely standing up in my apartment mademe unsteady.
So here we are, ten months later and I finally get to see the show.
Happily, all the key actors are still with it. Seeing it today, I'm a littleastonished that this ode to the theater and musicals and backstage
hilarity was trumped by the little musical that could, Fun Home  for Best
Musical. It must have been a close race indeed since this winning
throwback to the musical comedies of the Fifties (and not the 1650s, but
the 1950s) is a goofy pleasure.
Brian d'Arcy James (who left a delicious but small supporting role in
Hamilton  to star in this) plays Nick, one of the two Bottom brothers, a duo
that turns out promising theatrical work but are clearly in the shadow of
the rock star-like success of that bastard William Shakespeare. With
creditors breathing down his neck, a loving wife who is pregnant (Heidi
Blickenstaff), a little brother (John Cariani) who is a HUGE fan of the Bardand falling hard for a Puritan girl, not to mention a patron who demands anew idea but fast , well what's a bard (not THE Bard, but a bard) to do?
In desperation, Nick turns to Nostradamus (Brad Oscar). Well, not THE</p>
<p>Nostradamus but "a" Nostradamus and pays him to spy into the future
and reveal Shakespeare's biggest hit so it can be ripped off before
Shakespeare actually writes it. Not half bad as a seer, Nostradamuspredicts the invention of the musical but misconstrues Hamlet  as
Omelette . Hilarity ensues as they invent a new art form and Shakespeare
infiltrates their troupe. If the Bottoms don't quite come out on top, atleast musical comedy is a winner.
One can't help forming an impression of a show even without seeing it.
Frankly, my expectations were modest but happily surpassed. The
silliness is inspired; the "inside" jokes (as in references to Shakespeareanlines and musical theater history) are silly and fun, not annoyinglyknowing; and the performances by the leads are first rate. I doubt the
songs will have much of a life outside of the show. Still, like A
Gentleman's Guide To Love & Murder,  they work wonderfully well here and
are a happy throwback to the days when musicals could be fun.
New arrivals to the cast -- like Edward Hibbert in various turns with his
usual flair and André Ward kicking things off in style via "Welcome To TheRenaissance" -- fit in smoothly. Delivering in supporting parts since the
show opened, Blickenstaff makes the most out of a modest role as Nick's
wife and Kate Reinders has fun as the love interest Portia. ("Good name!")
But it's the leads that shine strongest and they don't show any signs of
flagging ten months into their run. Oscar is a hoot as the prophesying
Nostradamus (" Cats!" he shouts out, confused but certain he has seen
the future correctly.) Cariani is all tics and sighs as the nebbishy, insecure
Nigel Bottom, yet keeps him endearing. That bastard Shakespeare
(embodied with hilarious confidence by Christian Borle) was the only oneto win a Tony. Isn't that just like him? It's no wonder, since the show is
practically designed to create a killer turn, from Will's adoring entrance to
his stream of genuinely amusing asides and egotistical statements. Thepart is a huge opportunity, but I shudder to think what a lesser actormight reduce it to in terms of the obvious.
It's impossible to underrate James as the anchor of the show, allowing
the nuttiness to flow around him the way the leads of many great sitcomsplay it straight so those around them can be even funnier. He's
desperate, angry and appealing in his envy, like a Salieri who can sing.
Hamilton's  loss was Something Rotten's  gain. This show was a huge
gamble for its producers. It famously had such a great backer's showcasethat everyone decided to forego an out of town tryout and just open cold
on Broadway. In this day and age, that's a bold move and while it did
avoid the Hamilton  juggernaut of 2016, it didn't pay off in Tonys.
Artistically and commercially, however, it proved the smartest thing they</p>
<p>could do, a bet that paid off beautifully. The proof may well be on display
at the St. James in February of 2017.
SENSE & SENSIBILITY  *** 1/2 out of ****
GYM AT JUDSON
Bedlam  is one of the most acclaimed theater troupes in N.Y.C. and rightly
so. I was excited when they tackled Jane Austen, for this writer has been
the source of numerous great films (from the miniseries Pride & Prejudice
to Persuasion  and even Clueless ). Oddly, however, Austen has rarely been
successfully translated to the stage. You can see her work done here andthere, but it's almost never appeared on Broadway or in the West End
and even less often to critical and commercial acclaim.
Well, you could toss all that aside as ancient history when Bedlam dusted
off Sense and Sensibility  (itself turned into a classic film by Emma
Thompson who wrote, starred and had the sense to bring on Ang Lee as
director). This riotously funny production flies by -- quite literally, since
the entire set seems to be on wheels and moves about with alacrity tobring alive everything from a drawing room to a stately dinner to a horse
and carriage ride. Perhaps the key is a woman as interpreter? Thompson
did her best work in the screenplay and here Kate Hamill pulls off atriumph with her adaptation. (I actually typed "wit" by accident instead of
"with;" that works too.) it should become a staple for theaters around the
country.
Properly so, since this is an adaptation, Hamill's version has its ownsensibility. Here the humor is emphasized, but it never tilts the story out
of perspective. May I ask you to check out my original review of the</p>
<p>show?  Most everything applies again for a production I named one of the
Best of 2014.
In truth, this time I was mildly less dazzled than upon a first viewing,
simply because I'd already seen it and expected dazzle. And I missedtremendously director Eric Tucker's inimitable turn as Mrs. Jennings.(Gabra Zackman has the thankless task of following him in the role.) On
the plus side, playwright Hamill has settled into the part of the willful
Marianne much more convincingly here than the first time around, so let'scall it a wash. Everyone else remains superb or joins the company well,from John Russell as the dashing but disreputable John Willoughby to
Jason O'Connell's wonderfully understated Edward Ferrars. I was
amused before, but this time O'Connell's doubling as Edward'srambunctious and self-admiring brother had me in stitches.
And a second viewing allowed me to appreciate the subtleness of the
direction and staging even more. Tucker and Hamill have done wonders
here. The entire set is mobile and the fluid changes from scene to scene
are a delight. Even during scenes, it has purpose: when a character atdinner is about to divulge some tidbit of gossip (the coin of the realm inAusten's world), the other characters glide over on their chairs and crowd
around like vultures picking over a carcass. Again and again, I was struck
by how the movement of the characters and the sets may have beenclever
and playfully imaginative but always, always was keyed to the tenor of the
scene and the emotional undercurrents. If Elinor and Edward feel theworld conspiring to keep them apart, you can bet that the scene they're in
will end with the furniture and windows and chairs parading between
them to embody this. (I still object to the textually faithful but unwisestaging of the climax, but it's a small cavil.)
Finally, I am in love with Andrus Nichols, who plays Elinor with such
intelligence and presence that it almost erases my memory of Thompsonin the part. Somehow, I want her to remain with Bedlam (which she co-founded with Tucker and is the Producing Director of) and continue these
intimate productions and  be on Broadway and  be in film and TV as her
talent deserves. It makes no sense, but love never does.
BROADWAY & THE BARD  * 1/2 out of ****
THE LION THEATRE AT THEATRE ROW
Len Cariou is a Broadway legend, forever linked to that seminal original
production of Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd  with Angela Lansbury
but with a host of other notable theatrical credits to his name. Since
making a splash opposite Lauren Bacall in Applause,  this Tony winner has
toyed with the idea of an evening of Shakespearean soliloquies combined</p>
<p>with Broadway show tunes that either deepen the message of the piece
at hand or offer a riposte.
Now, finally, here it is, with the 76 year old actor -- currently starring as
the patriarch on the hit CBS show Blue Bloods  -- holding court in the
intimate space of Theatre Row's Lion with Mark Janas on piano.
(Photo by Carol Rosegg, 2016)
One might have structured this evening in a number of ways, thoughobviously John Gielgud already used "Ages Of Man." You might have toldthe story of Cariou's career through the progression of pieces. You mighthave offered insight into his acting. You might have just let Cariou loose
on his favorite stories. Unfortunately, only a little of each of these
approaches is present and none of it provides the structure and forwardmovement the show desperately needs. We're left adrift, with one piecerandomly following the next and no sense of it leading anywhere in
particular.
Those looking for insight into the Bard by Cariou come away empty.
Those hoping to sense the breadth of his impressive career will be bereft.
Those waiting for juicy stories will wait. (Tackling Lear was life-changing
for him, says Cariou, who builds up this semi-anecdote by saying he waschomping at the bit to play Macbeth, only to have the play changed at the
very last minute. It changed his life, he says, but how I haven't a clue.)
We're left with speeches and songs. Cariou can happily do justice to
many of the speeches. But out of context and with no over-arching
structure to contain them, their random nature often denudes them of
their power. He does a quietly menacing turn as Iago from Othello  and a
solid funeral speech by Marc Antony, But too often even here Cariou</p>
<p>comes roaring into Henry V  or some such part and we're barely caught up
before the piece is over.
The songs themselves are impeccable of course, but after the mildly
amusing contrast of Henry V's  rousing "once more" with the title tune
from Applause ," they feel pretty random. And Cariou's voice is a shadow
of its former self. Great singers can find a sweet spot later in life; theymay have lost range but gained such insight into the lyrics that rewardscan be found. I fear Cariou's voice has passed even that stage; recitationof the lyrics a la Mabel Mercer might have been wiser. Also, he seemed
lost in the lyrics a few times and dried up completely during "Brush Up
Your Shakespeare" at the finale.
Luckily, Cariou was surrounded by an audience happy to be sharing a
space with a talent they'd been seeing and appreciating for decades. Fora few moments, one could see the shape of the show he had in mind.
When Cariou transitioned from an absolutely lovely and convincing "Ages
Of Man" from As You Like It  into "September Song' (a tune that can
readily accommodate itself to a faded voice with poignant effectiveness)time indeed stopped and Broadway and the Bard and Cariou became
one.
