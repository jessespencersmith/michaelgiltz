 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Ethan Lipton's Show for the
100 Percent; Broadway by the Year
NO PLACE TO GO  ** 1/2 out of ****

JOE'S PUB AT PUBLIC THEATER
Ethan Lipton  is a talented performer and singer with a
retro sensibility and a mordantly modern attitude. After
seeing his new show/performance at Joe's Pub, I thinkof him as in the tradition of Van Dyke Parks and I'm afan.
No Place To Go  is a song cycle and/or theater piece about work. Lipton begins with a spoken word
monologue about his job as an "information refiner" for an unnamed but profitable company. Hispassion is his music, but Lipton needs a job and this gig is a good one. He's a "permanent part-time"employee, enjoys his work and is pretty good at it and likes the people he works with. After years there,it's a place to go in the morning.
Lipton tells us this while his crack band (the music is the show's strongest suit) provides accompaniment.
Part scene-setting, part social commentary, part hipster vibe, this intro smoothly segues into the song"Place To Go" and I settled in happily.
Turns out the company Lipton works for is making a profit even in this economic downturn. But it's not
enough of a profit and the company has decided to relocate... to Mars. (Land is pretty cheap there,apparently.) Everyone is invited to come along but of course the company knows not everyone will; theycan then replace those people with cheaper workers on Mars who won't have the salary of a 10 or 20 yearveteran. Will Lipton decide to uproot his life and go on the exciting adventure of moving to Mars? Or willhe face life as an unemployed man when getting any sort of job can be scarily difficult?
That's the dramatic thread holding the show together and it takes Lipton from a jokey tune about the last
sandwich left in the conference room after a meeting to "Aging Middle Class Parents" (maybe he and his
wife should move back in with his folks to save money?) to "Three Tear Plan," Lipton's reaction to all thisdrama.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>Song by song it's a lot of fun and the drama of the piece is certainly laced with humor and great music. I
recommend the CD where you can hear guitarist Eben Levy effortlessly conjure up rock to jazz to retropop, bassist Ian M. Riggs provide a supple groove and the terrific saxophone work of Vito Dieterle. A funtime is had by all.
As a piece of theater, however, Lipton needs to dig deeper and create the show he is surely capable of
producing. One challenge is his deadpan onstage demeanor. It works in the context of a concert, but his
mellow vibe flatlines any dramatic arc. He's got one temperature and it's smooth and unvarying; that's
not helped by the fact that the central dilemma of the show (Should he move to Mars) never seems like a
genuine option for our hero. More importantly, the songs too often settle for jokes or rough ideas when
more vivid characters and tension are needed.
Our hero is married but we have no sense of his wife. "Final Sandwich 1" (that bit about the left-over food
from a meeting) is a 30-second gag that is unfortunately reprised two more times to diminishing returns.Another storyline comes in later with Lipton up for a fellowship or grant of some sort. It's a very modestsum but would give his creative life validation. It's dismissed in one tune with a surreal touch (he eats hiscompetition before the winner is announced) out of keeping with the rest of the show. if any bit shouldbe reprised throughout the show, it should be this: while Lipton struggles with whether to move to Mars,he's also up for a fellowship that would give his music a stamp of meaning. Finding out whether he gets agrant will surely impact how he feels about risking all on his music or taking the gamble of moving toMars.
Some other songs are missed opportunities. "Soccer Song" in particular is less than it should be. As soon
as Lipton mentions the company soccer team, you start to think about the rich possibilities of it for a
song. Company sporting events (volleyball, softball, basketball, bowling or whatever) are rich areas toexplore in a song (or even an entire show, frankly). It's the one place where all the employees interact ona level playing field. Top management rub shoulders with rising stars and temp workers and guys fromthe mailroom. Older vets want to prove they're not just paper pushers, young workers want to show offwithout upstaging their boss, women want another chance to prove they're the equal of men and the oft-ignored backroom employees of the mailroom suddenly find themselves given a chance to prove theirworth and put those who barely know their names in their place. Van Dyke Parks or Randy Newmanwould have a field day. With all that ripe potential, Lipton just builds the song around some vaguesideline cheering and morphs the tune into other topics.
This is all to say that a fun outing with Lipton and his band can and should be much more if they're going
to pursue No Place To Go  as genuine theater. "WPA" is a clever but very pointed and effective song about
the economic policies that lifted this country up during the last Depression. The opener and hopefulcloser ("Nothing But A Comeback") effectively combine his monologues with a song. And "Three TearPlan" captures what Lipton does best: mix in humor and emotion with a great melody in a strikingly
original style. No Place To Go  has a lot of growing to do, but I'm definitely won over by Ethan Lipton  and
his wryly amusing style.
BROADWAY BY THE YEAR: 1950  ** 1/2 out of ****
TOWN HALLSerious fans of musical theater know that the Town Hall series Broadway By The Year  -- created and
hosted by Scott Siegel  -- will always deliver at least a few special moments every time. This night --
devoted to the musicals of 1950 -- was perhaps not the strongest of all but was time well spent when it
came to highlights.

<p>Beth Leavel didn't have to wait for a revival of Guys & Dolls  to put her stamp on "Adelaide's Lament."
She stepped up to the mike and delivered this show-stopper with the pipes and personality of a Broadway
star. So, Broadway classic delivered in high style? Check.
The marvelous Bobby Steggert anchored "There's A Building Going Up," a paean to the United Nations
then under construction in the 1950 revue Alive And Kicking . He was joined by Alexander Gemignani
and Matt Cavanaugh on this wide-eyed and wonderfully optimistic tune. So, rendition of an obscure but
enjoyable song from a show that will never be revived? Check.
Married Broadway stars Matt Cavenaugh and a beautifully pregnant Jenny Powers dueted on two comic
numbers: "Cherry Pies Ought To Be You" (a list song by Cole Porter) and "Darn It Baby, That's Love"
from a revue called Tickets, Please!  The latter was especially cute, though both were highlights. So,
glimpse of the cabaret act to come from what is apparently Broadway's answer to Steve Lawrence & EydieGorme? Check.
The band led by Ross Patterson was not at their best; the usual fine accompaniment for this series was a
little more intrusive and muddy than usual. They simply never got in sync with the singers. But the very
talented hoofer Kendrick Jones delivered with his usual aplomb and class, Bill Daughtery got to reprise
his entertaining a cappella rendition of "Sit Down You're Rocking The Boat," Aaron Lazar impressed on
"The Best Thing For You" and Gemignani (the show's director) has a modest voice but like a true
performer knows exactly what he can and should do with it. He's a real pro.
Still, for me the star of the night was Steggert. Charming and romantic on Irving Berlin's "It's A Lovely
Day Today," duetting nicely with Leveal on "You're Just In Love" and providing vocal support on other
numbers, Steggert's voice is beautiful, his stage presence warm and assured and he's always present andin the moment -- finding the emotional heart of a tune or simply watching and enjoying others as theysing onstage.
The chance to see Steggert and others like him tackle classics and obscure ditties is exactly why
Broadway By The Year  continues to be a success. The next show in the series takes place on May 14 and
covers 1975 . Before that, Siegel presents 11 O'Clock Numbers at 7 O'Clock , a revue at the jazz club
Birdland on April 2 and the ongoing series Broadway Ballyhoo  every Thursday night at 11 at Feinstein's .
