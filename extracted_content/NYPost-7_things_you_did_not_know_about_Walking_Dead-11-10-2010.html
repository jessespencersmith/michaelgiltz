It was inevitable that the hit series “The Walking Dead” would be
renewed this week after only two episodes.
The show’s premiere scored 5.3 million viewers — and more than 8 million total when you include
the DVR and rerun audience.
For the past few years, cable network AMC, which commissioned the horror series, has dominated
the Emmys with shows like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad.”
But now, “The Walking Dead” has done something the others never did: score big ratings.So here are some things about this game-changer of a series you never knew to ask:
1 “Did we say six episodes? We meant 16!” AMC executives are probably kicking themselves for
their caution in green-lighting just six episodes. Season 2 will have 13 — but no word yet on how
soon they’ll be able to start filming.
2 How big can it get? Despite all the
nice things critics have written, “MadMen” and “Breaking Bad” score CW-likeaudiences — just under 3 million. So,
AMC may have just found its “Sopranos”
— a critical and commercial triumph.Because the audiences for “Mad Men”and “The Sopranos” tripled and evenquadrupled over three or four seasons,
AMC should have its heart set on
growing “The Walking Dead” into a cableblockbuster. Ten million viewers aweek? At least.
3 How much violence can people
stomach? “The Walking Dead” didn’t pull
any punches in the first two episodes.Along with smearing zombie innards all
over our hero and draping intestines
around his neck, they showed lawmanRick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) gunningdown a little girl zombie in the very firstscene. Creator Frank Darabont (“The
Shawshank Redemption”) said at New

1. Family feud
2. Spidey's tangled web
3. Hubby would take back 'vow'
4. Cordial exes
5. End for Andy?
York City ComicCon he couldn’t believe
what Broadcast Standards andPractices was letting them get awaywith. He mimed smoking pot, as if
maybe the censors were stoned and
joked, “We’re going to make ‘Breaking Bad’ look like p-----s.”
4 Who will be the breakout star? Naturally, Lincoln is the center of the tale as Grimes, a small-
town cop who tries to maintain decency in an out-of-control world. Jon Bernthal plays his best
friend and fellow cop, Shane (who is sleeping with Grimes’ wife) and Sarah Wayne Callies (the
doctor on “Prison Break”) is Lori, the woman caught between the two. But fans of the comic booklove Glenn, so Stephen Yeun should have a blast playing the young pizza delivery guy (and
sometime thief) who kind-of welcomed the zombie apocalypse because at least it solved his
problem of massive credit-card debt.
5 Why does the show look different? Smart fans may be wondering how the show achieves its
distinctive, washed-out but realistic look. Darabont revealed they shoot much, if not all, of the
series on Super 16.
6 Who will play The Governor? Perhaps the juiciest role in upcoming seasons is The Governor,
the self-styled ruler of a secure, four-block area and a half-mad lunatic who feeds the parts of
humans who displease him to the undead and keeps his zombified daughter locked up in chains.Think Ian McShane in “Deadwood” . . . but crueler.
7 Can you stumble, drool, moan and show a fondness for human flesh? In contests for fans every
week, AMC is offering walk-on parts as the undead, among other promotional efforts. They’re
going to need a lot more zombies.
