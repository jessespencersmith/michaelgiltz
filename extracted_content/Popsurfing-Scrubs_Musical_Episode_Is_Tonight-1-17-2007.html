            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 8 ,  2 0 0 7"Scrubs" Musical Episode Is TonightTonight, "Scrubs" is airing a musical episode, with songs written orcowritten by the guys from "Avenue Q." I haven't seen an advance, butit sounds like a lot of fun. But if you want to squeeze any fun out of thisproject, just read the NYTimes review. Here's the lead: "There issomething about the urgent pace of technological progress that, nomatter how welcome, seems to navigate our tastes in historicalreverse." Huh? It gets worse:It didn’t seem long before the fashion for vacuum-cookedsalmon redounded to another fad for meatloaf and macaroniand cheese. The arrival of sleek, heat-retaining microfibersnever sent fur on its way, it only seemed to heighten a demandfor everything ermine, sable and pouffy. YouTube certainlyexists in no small part to indulge our nostalgic affinities. Andtelevision, for its part, has displayed a recent interest in whatsome have long considered entertainment’s hoariest form, themusical.Aargh, nothing worse than fake, tongue in cheek pseudo-intellectualclaptrap. YouTube exists to indulge our nostalgic affinities? I thought itexisted to show stupid clips of people making soda bottles fizz over andwatch stupid home videos. And who thinks the musical is the hoariestform of entertainment? Really, with "Chicago" and "Dreamgirls" and"Spring Awakening" on Broadway and Outkast making "Idlewild" andthe omnipresent musical allure of music videos and "High SchoolMusical" the biggest phenomenon of the year? To top it off, they justassume the new Disney TV movie "Jump In!" -- about competitivejump-roping -- is a musical. It ain't.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
