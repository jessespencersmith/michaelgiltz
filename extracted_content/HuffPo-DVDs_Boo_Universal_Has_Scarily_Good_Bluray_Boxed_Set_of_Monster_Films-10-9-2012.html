<p>UNIVERSAL CLASSIC MONSTERS: THE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION  ($159.98 BluRay;
Universal)
DARK SHADOWS  ($35.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- When it comes to splatter and gore, you can count
me out. But when it comes to classic horror films, movies that create believable even moving characters
(however misshapen or evil) then I'm in. No one did that better than the House Of Horror, Universal
Pictures. Just as Warner Bros. specialized in gangster flicks and MGM the musical, Universal made its
bones in horror films from the silent era on. This set contains eight of the crown jewels in their
collection, iconic movies presented with care on Blu-ray in smashing style. I haven't watched every
minute of every movie but everything I've looked at is very impressive. Dracula  contains both the
Spanish version (shot on the same set as the Bela Lugosi film after hours) and the Philip Glass score
along with the original film. Frankenstein of course includes the original edit. It and the superior sequel
Bride Of Frankenstein  are the peaks for me, two movies brimming with pathos and humor, respectively.
I've always found The Mummy  a bit draggy but Boris Karloff does great physical work under all that
makeup. The Invisible Man  is a stunt and pales quite a bit today, but what a film debut for Claude Rains.
He became a star just on the power of that mellifluous voice. (And how easily Rains might have been
stuck in horror like Vincent Price -- he's in this plus The Wolf Man  and The Phantom Of The Opera ). Lon
Chaney Jr. is no leading man but once he's in makeup, The Wolf Man  gains a certain emotional edge.
Phantom  is an overstuffed prestige pic when horror works best without delusions of grandeur. And
Creature From The Black Lagoon  is a bit of silliness but so influential (what a wave of '50s horror flicks
came in its wake) that it deserves its place in history and this collection. They even include the 3-Dversion here for the first time in ages. A slim, compact box (hurrah!) though I always prefer spindles tothe cardboard sleeves. Most importantly of all, you're seeing these films in top notch picture and sound,probably better than most people saw them even during their debut runs. Maybe Warner Bros. shouldhave let Universal remake Dark Shadows . They weren't averse to jokey movies (like Abbott & Costello
Meet Frankenstein ) but there was always a modicum of understanding for the conventions of the genre.
In Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's indifferent spoof of the cult TV series, not so much. Is Burton bored?He certainly seems to be.
CINDERELLA DIAMOND EDITION  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Disney) -- Cinderella  has always
resided in the top tier of Disney films. But not for me. I appreciate the beauty of the drawings but thebackgrounds are exceptionally static throughout to save money. It's not an artistic choice to create acertain look and they surely didn't turn necessity to their advantage. That keeps me from ranking thisslight tale higher. They do a good job of beefing up the animal characters to flesh out the story (such asthe mice Gus and Jacques) but it's still pushing it to get to 75 minutes. Having said all that, it's firmly inthe second tier of solid Disney films and is beautifully presented here. A terrific bonus is the short filmTangled Ever After , which not surprisingly stars the horse from Tangled, one of the great animal
characters in Disney history and it's all achieved without him speaking a word.

<p>fences on the drama Magic City . It's Mad Men  meets The Sopranos, but in Miami so you get more
bikinis, which is always a good thing. The show leans more towards soap than genuine drama but the
cast is handsome and the look of the show top-notch. Maybe the writing will catch up to its aspirations (I
haven't finished the season yet). New Girl has a terrific ensemble and Zooey Deschanel is winning as the
title character surrounded by her guy pals including Nick (jake Johnson) who she is totally going to sleep
with or date at some point. (Make it soon; don't drag these things out.) But my favorite is the adorkableMax Greenfield. I'm still astonished that the bizarre mumbly drawl he created for his character inVeronica Mars  was not his real speaking voice. Now if they'd just tone down the over the top nuttiness
and keep it grounded in reality, the show would be funnier. If they're lucky, New Girl  will have some
seasons as good as the best years of How I Met Your Mother , another solid comedy with a great cast.
They keep me tuning in every once in a while, even though I've long ago stopped caring about who thereal mother is or frankly the convoluted love lives of our leads. If you're heartbroken that DowntonAbbey  stole the thunder from the reboot of Upstairs Downstairs  and you really want a fix but have
already watched the original a gazillion times, well you might try Thomas & Sarah . It's a tepid spin-off
from the original series and isn't a patch on that classic, but Pauline Collins remains a hoot, even in these
lesser circumstances.
ANNIE  ($14.99 BluRay; Sony) -- Annie  just began playing previews on Broadway  and I'm excited to see
it since I've never seen the show in person. I've only seen the pretty good 1999 TV movie starring Victor
Garber and this stiff 1982 feature film edition starring Albert Finney and Carol Burnett (the best thing init). On the plus side, it's been put out on DVD in its original widescreen aspect ratio, instead of thehorribly cropped edition they released on DVD. And while it's not remastered, the Blu-ray does lookbetter than that earlier version (not a high bar, believe me, but it does look decent). So fans of the movie(especially those who want to enjoy Burnett's excellent work) have an inexpensive option now.
GERHARD RICHTER PAINTING  ($29.95 DVD; Kino Lorber) -- This film doesn't promise to reveal
or explain Richter. It's not Richter Bares His Soul. So you shouldn't be surprised by the alternatelyfrustrating and intriguing glimpse into his work methods. I've never heard the artist talk before so I washappily surprised by his amusing comments and attitude. You are at a certain remove from the action,but then if you were in his studio and felt constrained about yelling out a hundred questions, this isexactly the experience you would have. It's certainly compelling for those fascinated by modern art ingeneral or Richter in particular. The uninitiated might feel they were watching paint dry and in a sensethey'd be right. But in the proper context, it turns out that can be rather absorbing. The extras, especiallya chat with Richter and an art historian that lasts 23 minutes, are solid.</p>
<p>THE NIGHT RIDERS  ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films)
RED RIVER RANGE  ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films)
OVERLAND STAGE RAIDERS  ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films)
THREE TEXAS STEERS  ($24.95 Bluray; Olive Films) -- I guess there's always more to learn about
Hollywood history. Until these Blu-rays came out, I'd never heard of The Three Mesquiteers , a Western
spin on The Three Musketeers  (but minus D'Artagnan). That's not surprising until you hear they made 51
of them from 1936 to 1943 and that eight of them starred John Wayne. Here are four of Wayne's movies.
Naturally, I'd prefer they put out all eight of Wayne's flicks in one cheap set, but Olive is a small companyrescuing films from the vaults so that's just not possible. On the plus side, these all look pretty terrific.The Night Riders  is atypical because it's set not in 1939 (when it was released) but in the 1800s with the
assassination of President Garfield as a plot twist. Hilariously, they do good in this film while donning thecostumes also worn by the KKK. No allusion is intended and there's certainly no racial subtext to the filmbut it's rather amusingly off-putting to see them help ranch hands and farmers while wearing such a vilesymbol of hatred. The other three are more standard fare, with Overland  featuring silent film icon Louise
Brooks in her last screen appearance.They're all under an hour and only John Wayne completists or B-Western nuts need apply. But I'm thrilled: Since 1939 is always touted as the best year in film history, I'll
watch anything made from that year and this gives me three more flicks to add to my list.</p>
<p>THE WAR OF THE ROSES SIGNATURE SERIES
WALL STREET SIGNATURE SERIESTHE BROTHERS MCMULLEN SIGNATURE SERIESSHE'S THE ONE SIGNATURE SERIESTHE FRENCH CONNECTION SIGNATURE SERIES  ($24.99 each BluRay; FOX) -- Five films in
the Signature Series, which guarantees that the director has overseen the remastering of the film and itspresentation on Blu-ray. Michael Douglas shines in Wall Street  of course but his even better work in The
War Of The Roses  has gone unappreciated, much like the film itself. It's a black comedy about divorce
that is Danny DeVito's crowning achievement as a director. Edward Burns is represented with his twobest films: his breakthrough The Brothers McMullen  and his romantic drama with Jennifer Aniston, an
actress who should have made the transition to film easily but somehow didn't. Finally, there's WilliamFriedkin's best film by a country mile, the gritty action film The French Connection.  Oh for the days
when a regular Joe like Gene Hackman could be a movie star!

<p>Michael, re: Universal Classic Monsters. I would have removed "Phantom Of The Opera" and
actually added "Abott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". But thats just me, I grew up in the 60'swatching this stuff on Saturday afternoons.
