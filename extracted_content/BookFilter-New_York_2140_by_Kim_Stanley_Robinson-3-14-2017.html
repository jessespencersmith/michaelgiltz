From the Publisher:
New York Times  bestselling author Kim Stanley Robinson returns with a
bold and brilliant vision of New York City in the next century.As the sea levels rose, every street became a canal. Every skyscraper anisland. For the residents of one apartment building in Madison Square,however, New York in the year 2140 is far from a drowned city.
There is the market trader, who finds opportunities where others find
trouble. There is the detective, whose work will never disappear --- alongwith the lawyers, of course.There is the internet star, beloved by millions for her airship adventures,and the building's manager, quietly respected for his attention to detail.
Then there are two boys who don't live there, but have no other home--
and who are more important to its future than anyone might imagine.Lastly…

What We Say
Kim Stanley Robinson is one of our boldest and most engaging writers of science fiction. He's already written a trilogy of
novels about climate change set in DC called the "Science In The Capitol" trilogy. Now he's headed to New York City. Twocatastrophically historic rises in sea levels have turned Manhattan into a new Venice, albeit one mostly enjoyed by
bohemians and nutters and those willing to put up with dangerous conditions to make a life for themselves on the edges of
what is the new coastline. Once the stage is set, Robinson upends everything with two more disasters, one natural and oneeconomic. In a way, "New York 2140" becomes progressive porn for sci-fi fans. Sure, it took more than one hundred years,Share This Book

<p>but this time when the US faces economic collapse the response is deliciously satisfying. As with any good writer, Robinson
creates vivid characters and stories that draw us in, from the police chief looking into the disappearance of two coders to
the superintendent of a building constantly fighting off the threat of flooding to a Wall Street guy who might just get a
little altruistic to woo a woman he likes and on and on. But as with the best of sci-fi writers dealing in hard science,Robinson has thoughtfully extrapolated what conditions science predicts in our near future with the ramifications of whatthat might mean for how people live and struggle and thrive. Human nature doesn't change and good writers like Robinsonknow that.They also know sci-fi can open our eyes to the possibilities (and threats) ahead while proving that people are
always lusty and kind and greedy and scared no matter what world they live in. "New York 2140" is dependably fascinating
about what adapting to a radically different environment might mean. More importantly Robinson creates characters thatfascinate -- the book may end but as with other recent stand-alone novels by him, the world he's created is so vivid wenever doubt their story goes on. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Science fiction is threaded everywhere through culture nowadays, and it would take an act of critical myopia to
miss the fact that Robinson is one of the world's finest working novelists, in any genre. NEW YORK 2140 is atowering novel about a genuinely grave threat to civilisation."â Guardian on New York 2140  - 
"An exploration of human resilience in the face of extreme pressure...starkly beautiful and fundamentallyoptimistic visions of technological and social change in the face of some of the worst devastation we might bring
upon ourselves."â The Conversation  - 
"As much a critique of contemporary capitalism, social mores and timeless human foibles, this energetic, multi-
layered narrative is also a model of visionary worldbuilding."â RT Book Reviews  (Top Pick!) on New York 2140  - 
"A thoroughly enjoyable exercise in worldbuilding, written with a cleareyed love for the city's past, present, andfuture."â Kirkus on New York 2140  - 
"The tale is one of adventure, intrigue, relationships, and market forces....…
