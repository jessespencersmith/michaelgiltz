8/30/2005 10:53:00 AMEveryone knows Bush misleads the American people about thesize of the Iraqi army. (There are about 3000 Iraqis trained andready to fight on their own. 3000.) Less reported is the factthat even if there were more soldiers available, the equipmentjust isn't there. One reason? Corruption. The other? Bush isafraid to give them any weapons because he knows the countrycould collapse into all-out civil war at any moment. I guessimminent collapse is all part of the "process."
