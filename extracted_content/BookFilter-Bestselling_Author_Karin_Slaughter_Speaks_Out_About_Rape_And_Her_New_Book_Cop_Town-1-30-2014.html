Gillian Flynn says Slaughter is "one of the best thriller writers working today." And MichaelConnelly says, "If you haven't read her yet, this is the moment."Though Slaughter is famed for two different crime series set in Georgia (one in Atlanta, the other in a fictionalcounty), Cop Town is a "stand-alone." It's set in the 1970s and features Kate Murphy, a new rookie female copjoining the force and desperate to keep her privileged background a secret. Kate is paired with a tough veterannamed Maggie Lawson, a blue blood in the only sense that counts to other cops: a blue-collar worker from afamily of policemen.For readers new to Slaughter, Cop Town is a great place to start. Out in July is Pretty Girls, another "stand-alone" book, this one her first that doesn't revolve around cops, though of course there's crime aplenty.Slaughter isn't just a brand-name writer; she's also a passionate advocate for the issues raised in her books, aswell as for life in the South.Here's Slaughter talking about the self-sufficiency her dad inculcated into all his daughters and why it was soimportant to him:And here's Slaughter speaking forcefully and smartly on rape and why the police are no better than the rest ofsociety about believing women:To watch the rest of Karin Slaughter's interview about her new book and career, head to BookFilter.com andclick on the video on the front page.
