THE GATE CI987)
iln portat lf you say "Candyman" five times
while looking into a mirror, it calls into existence
the vengeful son of a murdered slave in this cult
favorite based on a Clive Barker story.
The probhm: Umm, don't say "Candyman" five
times while looking in a mirror and you're good
to go. One online jokester insists if you say it 10
times while looking in a mirror, "Sesame Street's"
Count von Count appears and congratulates you
on your counting skills.
THEGUARDTAN (1990)
Tfte portat Director William Friedkin came
a long way down from "The Exorcist" when
he directed this story of a pagan nanny who
sacrifices babies to the hungry tree lurking
menacingly in the backyard.
Ite prcblem: Stating the movie is "from the
director of 'The Exorcist"' in ads doesn't make a
movie scary. And worshiping a tree is just silly.flte portaft A young Stephen Dorff
plays Glen, a kid who finds out that
removing a rotting tree stump reveals a
mysterious hole ... to Hell!
Tlrc prcbhm: lt's hard to be scared of demons
threatening to take over the world when they
couldn't even get past the stump of an old tree
until humans removed it. .***
AITACKOFTHE KILLER
TOMATOES!(1978)
The portal We don't know why, we don't know
how but tomatoes have become imbued with
evil and are outto destroy humanity - especially
anyone who asks you to "pass the ketchup."
The probhm: What problem? This prescient
film clearly saw to the present, when people
would be seized with panic over killer tomatoes,
and restaurants and delis around the countryg n movies, evil can reach our world by many
$ doorways - through ancient amulets, mighty
$ spells and, as in "The Exorcist," even an
N innocent girl. But sometimes, the spawn of hell
get a little lazy and take any old pathway into our
reality.
In the new horror film "Mirrors," opening
Friday, those reflective objects aren't just seven
years of bad luck when you crack them. As Keifer
Sutherland realizes, the mirrors are a portal for
supernatural forces.
"What if the mirrors can actually make us do
things that we don't want to do?" Sutherland
breathlessly asks. And what if the baddies take
some decidedly lame shortcuts to unleashing evil?
Here are some movies where horror slides in on a
portal that's banal, odd or just plain goofy.
THE SENTINEL(1977)
Tfte portat The gateway to Hell is a really nice
furnished apartment in Brooklyn Heights with an
incredibly low monthly rent - the new home of a
lapsed Catholic/hot model (Cristina Raines) and
her lawyer-boyfriend (Chris Sarandon).
The problenr To most New Yorkers, a great
aparfnent at a steal of a price is a vision of heaven,
not Hell. lf ifs rent-controlled. we ll move in even if
the place does come with demons.
POLTERGEIST (1982)
Ihe portaft "They're heeeeere!" was
the spooky catch phrase of the summerwhen Heather O'Rourke started
communicating with ghosts embedded
in the fuzzy signal of a TV set.
flrc prcblem: Thanks to cable and
24-hour programming, there is no
end-of-the-day static on TV anymore
- which means those ancient lndian
spirits will have to get their revenge
some other way.
