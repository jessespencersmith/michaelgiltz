MOST POPULAR
Atop the youth marketn the Jonas Brothers are the princes of all media
BY MICHAELGIIdTZ
ids rule the world. Or at least
the entertainment industry. The
tween rharket is insatiable, de-
spite the economic downturn.
And there's nothing it craves
more than the Jonas Brothers.
The Jersey-bom trio spent 2008 crissqossing the
country playing 85 concerts and perfoming in front
of nearly a million people. This year, the brothere made
a pit stop in Washington, D C ,.to entertain superfans
Sasha and Malia Obama on inauguration night
Now, Hollywood expects them to sell 3 million tickets
irjust one weekend to "Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert
Experience." The frlm, which opens on Friday, will be the
latest testofjust how popular the brothers have becone
They guest-staned in the 3-D movie "Hmnah
Montana^{iley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concefi
Tour," which bicame by far the top-grossing concert
film of all time when it made $65 million last year
(No. 2 of all time? "Madoma: Truth or Dare" at $15 mil-
lion, followed by "U2 3D" at $9 million.)
-The Jonas Brothere film is a little bit different," says
David Mumpowe4 the founder of Box Office Prophets,
a movie-grosses Web site "It's kind of hard to gauge
how popular they a{e. But the fact that we're talking
about a possible $20 million or $30 million weekend is
telling They're doing all the right things."
That includes gaining credibility with adults The
Jonas Brothem have been musical guests on 'lsafur-
day Night Live" md chmpioned by Ellen DeGeneres
Elvis Costello has hung out lvith the three at their re-
quest Conan O'Brien says he sings their songs while
driving his kids abund Stevie Wonder joined them in a
jam session at the Grmmys, and Timbaland has asked
them to contribute to his new solo album They also
becme the yomgest act (Kevin is 21, Joe is 19, and Nick
is l$) to make the cover of Rolling Stone
So while their audience is definitely dominated by the
screming girls who made "T[.ilight" a phenomenon (the
guys will be on the somdtrack to the sequel, by the way),
those girls won't exactly be dragging their moms to the
movie theater. The wholesome kids - Chdstims riEht
doM to their purity rings - sheepisNy admit a lot;f
moms screm for them as well.
But how big ile they? As big as 'N Sync in its heyday?
last year, the Jonas Brothers sold 1.5 million copies of
their critically acclaimed third album, "A Little Bit Irn-
ger" 'N Slmc sold I I million copies of its critica[y ac-
claimed third album, "No Strings Attached," in one day.
On the other hmd, 'N Slmc's concert film "Bigger Than
Live" grossed $ 1 .8 million in 200 I The Jonas Brothers arepeil irelevant. "It seems like ringtones might be the
best judge of popularity," jokes Mumpower. Well, ;genuine ta.lent. They Mite or co-Mite most of theil

i ...N TAYLOR SWIFT
Switt's country songs chronr-
cle heartbreak and romance from a
girl's point
of view. Her breakout single, "Tim
McGraw," was inspired by a boy-
friend heading off to college Her
second single,
"Teardrops on My Guitar," was
about a
boy who just wants to be
friends You'get the picture
Swift, 19, was the best-sell-
ing artist of 2008 , moving 4
million copies of her first two
CDs She's not a multime-
diajuggernaut like the Jonas
boys or Cyrus, but Swift did
appear in both of their
new mov
ies and even
ti They broke up. but at
least she Bot a song out
of it, not surprisingly
- the ironically named
"Forever & Always "
The new girl:
DEMI LOVATO N
Lovato, 16, was lauriched to pop heav-
en not by recording an album and touring
but by making the TV movie "Camp Rock"
with the Jonas Brothers She played a
fresh-faced kid who learns the importance
of being true to yourself when at summer
camp for would-be rockers
Bom Demetria Devonne Lovato in
Dallas, she released a debut album last
year (with a few songs co-written by the
Jonas Brothers, because Lovato - a fan
of hearlr metal - says her own material
is "too dark'); it'll be reissued next month
with new songs and aDVD She has
her own series spun off from "Camp
Rock," called "Sonny With a Chance,"
duets with Joe in the Jonas Brothers con-
cert flick and co-stars in the Disney TV
movie "Princess Protection Program" with
Gomez, a good friend she met while audi-
tioning for "Bamey & Friends." o
N The prom queen: MILEY CYRUSo

EoBy now, everyone can figure out the
split-personality world of Cyms and
Hannah Montana Both are pop super-
stars; Hannah is the alter ego of Miley
Stewart. who is played by Cyn:s. the
daughter of one-hit wonder Billy Ray
("Achy Breaky Heart") Cyrus, who plays
Miley,&Iannah's dad on "Hamah Mon-
tana " Montana went supernova in pop-
ularity when her 3-D concert film (fea-
turing the Jonas Brothers) grossed more
than $30 million when it opened a year
ago
Part of Claus' girl-next-door appeal
is that it's easv for teens (and their kidsisters) to picture themselved in C).rus'
Sparkly shoes.
That appeal will only grow when
"Hamah Montana; The Movie" opens
April 8 Like the Jonas Brothers, CJms,
16, has written or co-written many of the
songs on her two solo albums, both of
whichhitNo 1 Shedated (andbrokeup
with) Nick Jonas. and is now linked to
20-year-old aspiring country singer
Justin Gaston. But her current love
seems to tre posting YouTube videos
she calls "The Mandy and Miley show,"
shot in her bedroom with friend Man-
dv JirouThe cheerleader:.N SELENA GOMEZ
Gomez, 16 - named after the late Tejano
singer Selena - is, like her pal Demi l-vato,
from Dallas She's made her biggest impact
as an actress, hitting big with the silly sitcom
'll4zards ofWaverly Place" (she recorded the
song "Everything Is Not What It Seems" for
the show as well) Last year she did the ro-
mantic-comedy sequel "Another Cinderel-
la Story" and she has an upcoming TV movie,
"Princess Protection Program," with Irvato
Watch for her pop album this summer, and ex-
pect it to have at least one heart-break ballad
considering shejust broke up with her boy-
friend - Nick
Jonas, of course@
