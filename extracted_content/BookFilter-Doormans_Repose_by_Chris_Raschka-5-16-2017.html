 The Doorman’s Repose
The Doorman’s Repose
by Chris Raschka
Price: $17.95 (Hardcover)
Published: May 16, 2017
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: Some of us look up at those craggy, mysterious
apartment buildings found in the  posher parts of New York City and
wonder what goes on inside. The Doorman’s  Repose collects ten stories of
the doings of 777 Garden Avenue, one of the craggiest.  The first story
recounts the travails of the new doorman, who excels at all aspects  of his
work except for perhaps the most important—talking baseball. Other
stories  tell of a long-forgotten room, a cupid-like elevator, a poisoned
boiler, and the  unlikely romance of a cerebral psychologist and a jazz
musician, both mice.
Because the animals talk and the machinery has feelings, these are
children’s stories.  Otherwise they are for any child or adult intrigued by
what happens when many  people, strangers or kin, live between shared
walls and ceilings, under one high,  gargoyled, turreted roof.

What We Say
Do you know the publishing imprint New York Review Books? For years, their paperback reissues of obscure, forgotten or
never-appreciated gems have had a magnetic pull on book lovers. They use a recurring design on their covers so you canspot them a mile away and I've almost literally never been disappointed by their picks. As Criterion is for films on BluRay,
NYRB is for books -- if they put it out, you'll want to read it. Now they're doing the same with kids books. So without even
glancing at the author or any other details, I simply grabbed a copy of "The Doorman's Repose" simply because it was fromNew York Review Children's Collection. Like others in their series, I was immediately delighted. It's an unknown treatShare This Book

<p>(unknown to me, at least) about the people living in a New York City building and the doorman who works there. (He's a
very good doorman despite being the rare doorman who has no interest in sports and can't chat knowledgeably about
batting orders and the like.) What a pleasure -- you get stories about the building eccentric, kids, old people, the family of
mice who swap homes with country mice every summer, the inevitable nosy neighbor who finds pleasure in bossing othersaround, the city law that requires every large apartment building to have at least one opera singer in resident, a finickyboiler and so on. Each tale was a treat, an innocent reminder of...wait, what? The internet? How could some kid's bookfrom the 1950s or 1970s or 1920s or whenever this first came out reference the internet? Dear God, this book is by Chris
Raschka and it's brand new! Can one pay a higher compliment to a book of this sort than to say you believed without a
shadow of a doubt it was a long-lost classic that had simply escaped your attention? So consider this a future classic. Eachtale gently builds on the one before (that nuisance of a tenant is given her modest due in a later tale) and it culminates ina final story that delivers the work's entire philosophy of life (we're all connected to one another, whether we like it ornot) in one final aria. Still, they might have included a map showing Garden Avenue in Manhattan or at least better
directions. I keep looking for 777 Garden Avenue on the Upper East Side but can't quite seem to find it. -- Michael Giltz
