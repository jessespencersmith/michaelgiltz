learned to hold a crowd's
attention the har.d way: by
working as street performers
in Europe so they could afford
to eat and rent a hotel room.
"I remember the first show we did in
London," says Francisco Cruz, 24, who,
with younger brother Raphael and three
of their best friends, went on an unofficial
"tour" of Europe during a summer break
from clown school in Montreal to work thecrowds for pocket change.
"\Me made this whole show written all
down on paper. But I don't think we picked
the best spot. Our show was 25 minutes long
and we made, Ithink, three pounds," Cruz
laughs. "That's about $6! It was ridiculous."</p>
<p>But they'd been perfoming and re-
hearsing together for years Francisco
and Raphael gtew upjust outside San
Francisco and met their friends Brad
Henderson and William Underwood
while studying circus moves, like Chinese
hoop-diving, hand-to-hand (which in-
volves glmnastics-like moves with a part-
ner) and Chinese-pole mmeuvers.
They aII wenl to Montreal for cirrus
college. and there mel Hâ‚¬loise Bourgeois
The five became inseparable, constantly
working together on tricks and routines.
So they knew how to adapt
"For the rest of our time in hndon, in-
stead of doing sheet shows, we'd actually
work a street light," explaitr Cro. "V/e'd
find a busy intersection, md when there i
was a red light, we'd run out, do a trick
then M to each car and try to get money.
And they'd be throwing money at u! In an
hou4 we'd make about 80 pounds ln two
hours, we'd make 200 pomds "
If it wasn't already cleil, they were ,
meant to work together. Luckily, as
they neared graduation in 2001, a
Montreal-based circus company caLled
the 7 Fingers was lpoking to create a
show Veterans of the nouveau perfor- l
mmce phenomenon Cirque du Soleil,
the 7 Fingers had casually forrned out of
a desire to create their oM show.
'lve reallywmted to create something ,
we called 'circus with a humal scale,"' i
says Shana Canoll, one of the artistic d! r
rectors of the company md, along with .
Gypsy Snider, a director of "Traces."
"We'dbeen doingthese huge produc- :
tions, and our instinct was to go intimate :
and demystify circus "
Their f,rst production - "Lofts," in
2002 - was an inmediate hit and
is still perfomed all over the
world- They wanted to
build on that
success without /'.
duplicating it,
and here was
a group of kids
Camoll had known since most of
them were little (She and Snider uged
them to further their leming in
Montreal.)
"After their three years of circus
school, we thought, hey, we should hire
them!" says Cmoll "If anyone is going
to do a show with them, it should be us."
The result is "Traces," a 90-minute
burst of energy and creativity that incor-
porates eveq/thing from basketball and
skateboarding and piano playing toIn classic 7 Fingers style, the five per-
formers reveal details about thernFelves
so the audience becomes invested in them
as personalities md really cres about the
dangerous, physically demmding work
they do onstage lt's the sme lesson they
lemed in London
"It's not only about the trick," says
Cruz of the show he has been working
on and perforrning in for more than two
years "People need to see personality.
They need to see we're having fun."
Sometimes, almost too much fun,
"They're young, and there are
attention-span problems compared to
other people we're used to working
with," laughs Canoll, who hopes another
7 Fingers show - "La Vie," a dark caba-
r et act - can refum to New York for an
extended run after playing in the Spie-
geltent at South Street Seaport last yetr
"Putting skateboards and basket-
balls in the shows. sometimes we think
it wasn't such a good idea because every
time there's a five-second break. thev're
jumping around!" a
