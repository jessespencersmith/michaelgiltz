6/23/2005 10:21:00 PMI watched ABC World News Tonight to see how they coveredKarl Rove's remarks -- it was the fourth or fifth story after adrumbeat of bad news for Bush and was characterized astypical partisan attacks, rather than an offensive new low.(Better they'll be playing catch-up tomorrow.)But in a related story on Iraq and the grilling of Rumsfeld, ABCNews made an astute point. In trying to downplay theinsurgency, the Pentagon estimated it was about 25,000strong. Oops! In November, 2003, the Pentagon said theinsurgency was about 5,000 strong. Some "last throes."
