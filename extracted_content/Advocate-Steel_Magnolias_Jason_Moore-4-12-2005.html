That Southern grail of comedy,Steel Magnolias, is back+nd on Broadway-
wilh Avenue0's acclaimed out director in charge By Michael Giltz
he revirzl of Steel Magmo\i,as at
New York's Lyceum Theater
promises a welcome contrast to
current Broadway dramas like
Tweh.te Angry Men. "We're the
perfect antidote," quips out director
Jason Moore. "We're Sia Happy Wam,en."
The play, a 1987 off-Broadway hit
now making its Broadway debut, was
penned in just 10 days by Louisianaplay-
wright Robert Harling after his sister
Susan died of complications from dia-
betes. It focuses on a group of women
who gather in a beauty parlor, the one
safe place where they can gripe about-
and support each other through-mar-
riages, illness, and death.
"I'm from Arkansas, and knowing
these people and my mom being a single
mother, it's what I come from," says
Moore, 34. He also relates personally to
the sense of loss that motivated Harling
to write about his sister. "I had abrother
who died in a car accident in a very
shocking way," says Moore, "so the con-cept of loss is always something I think a
lot about."
Moore suffered a second loss when
his mother died unexpectedly on the
first day of rehearsals for Auenue Q,
which he directed both off and on
Broadway. Now he likes to remember
that the film adaptation of Magnolias
was one of his mother's favorites. "In
terms of examining loss, [Sfeel Magno-
liasl is a really entertaining and hearten-
ing way of Iookhg at it," he says.
The cast comprises Frances Stern-
hagen, Christine Ebersole, Rebecca Gay-
heart, Lily Rabe, Marsha Mason, and
Delta Burke as beauty-shop owner
Truvy (played by Dolly Parton in the
movie). "IVe never done much theater,"
Burke confesses. But she's clearly hav-
ing a wonderful time working with
Moore and Harling. "Gay men under-
stand me better," she says.
Harling has shown his understanding
of women in Hollywood hits like The
First Wiues CIub and Soandi,sh (whichhe's turning into a musical); he's now
working on a big-screen version of Dal-
lns and a project for Reese Witherspoon
called Sporfs Wid.otn. Indeed, says Har-
Iing, this revival gives him a chance to
spotlight one woman friend in particnlar:
"I've known Franny [Sternhagen] for
years and years. It's always been a
dream of mine to write something for
FYances, and little did I realize I had!"
In the end it's that spirit of friendship
that distinguishes Sleel Magno\ias from
some of the comedies that came after. AI-
though the play is famed for its one-liners
("The only thing that sepaxates us from
the animals is our abiliSr to accessorize"),
Moore is determined to keep the emo-
tions real and not reduce the lives of
these women to a wacky sitcom. How's
that done, exactly? Moore laughs: "You
stay away from garish oranges and pinks
and really big hair and shoulder pads." I
