Small town helps teen 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
HALLMARK Hall of Fame follows up 
its critically acclaimed drama "The 
J31ackwater Lightship" with an­
other quiet gem. 
"Plainsong" stars Aidan Quinn as Tom 
Guthrie, a school teacher in Colorado 
who is dealing with a clinically depressed 
wife who leaves him to raise their two 
young sons. Based on the bestselling 
novel by Kent Haruf, the film, airing this 
Sunday night on CBS, revolves around a 
host of small-town inhabitants who are 
brought together by a homeless pregnant 
teenager. 
Many of the characters lead lives of 
quiet desperation. Tom, for one, keeps a 
stable home for the boys while dealing 
with an abusive student and -just as his 
marriage dissolves -the unexpected at­
tentions of no-nonsense fellow teacher 
Maggie Jones, played the versatile Rachel 
Griffiths, the mercurial Brenda of HBO's 
"Six Feet Under." 
"Tom's a wounded soul," says Quinn, 
"he's a lonely, exasperated, good-hearted 
schmuck who needs to learn to enjoy 
himself and -as the stewardess says -
take the oxygen mask and put it on him­
self first before he tries to take care of 
anyone else." 
Quinn was also interested in playing 
Tom because of where he was from. 
"Rural people are so unrepresented in the 
media," says the 45-year-old actor. "It's 
nice to 'get that kind of story out." 
For 'America Ferrera, who plays Victo­
ria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenager for 
whom Maggie fmds a place to live after 
r 1\ the girl's mother kicks her out, doing 
"Plainsong" is a chance to prove her ac­
claimed debut in 2002's "Real Women 
Have Curves" wasn't a fluke. 
That challenge came in the scene where 
Victoria gives birth. "] wanted to make 
that as real as possible and ] spent the 
most time trying to make that authentic," 
says Ferrera, who turned 20 on April 18. 
"] watched a lot of birthing videos, which 
were painful to watch." The preparation 
was sobering in more personal ways. "] 
told my mom she never has to worry 
about me getting pregnant," says Ferrera. 
Having a family is the furthest thing 
from Ferrera's mind these days. She's 
pursuing a degree in international rela­
tions at USC in Los Angeles and filming 
an upcoming Warner Bros. project based 
on the best-selling young adult novel 
"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants." 
Both Quinn and Ferrera took time to 
praise the chameleon-like Griffiths. Fer­
rera found her ability to perform from in­
stinct inspiring and Quinn admired her 
ease with the camera. 
"She has a facility of turning on when 
the camera's on and sashaying with a 
charisma that is hard to describe but is 
instantaneous," says Q!.Iinn. "When you 
have a lot of experience on television and 
shoot six or seven pages a day, you get 
very familiar with the language of the 
camera. ] find some really good actors 
that work in television series are very 
good at combining the technical aspects 
with the other stuff." 
With "Plainsong," Quinn adds another 
prestigious film to his impressive list of 
TV credits. He first impressed audiences with his sensitive portrayal of a gay man 
who is diagnosed with AIDS in the pio­
neering 1985 TV movie "An Early Frost" 
with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. 
Last year, he played notorious traitor 
Benedict Arnold in a TV biopic. On film, 
Quinn's subtle acting style was seen to 
great effect in 1994's "Legends of the Fall" 
with Brad Pitt. Even after a 20-year ca­
reer, Quinn insists he has lots to learn. 
''You're always confronting things that 
are scary and fmding the courage to make 
a fool of yourself in front of a hundred 
people. That's what ] do for a living," he 
says. "And for someone that has a lot of 
pride and a lot of dignity -or thinks that 
they do -it's very hard to be a blubber­
ing fool in front of a hundred working­
class people. But that's my job." 
Quinn, who spends much of his time in 
upstate New York with his wife and two 
daughters, has a sudden rush of high pro­
file projects coming up, including HBO's 
"Empire Falls" with Paul Newman and 
Joanne Woodwar, and the feature film 
"Cavedweller," director Lisa Choloden­
ko's followup to "Laurel Canyon." 
"Before 1 did 'Plainsong,' 1 hadn't done a 
film in eight months," says Quinn. "Then 
] did six in a year, so it's just crazy. 1 had 
been doing theater, so ] wasn't just sitting 
around. I'm not one of the top five of ac­
tors in America who can pick and choose 
from the creme de la creme of work. Not 
to be cynical, but I'm somewhere on the 
continuum of what Robert Mitchum said, 
'I take the thing that's least embarrassing 
that I'm offered.'"
