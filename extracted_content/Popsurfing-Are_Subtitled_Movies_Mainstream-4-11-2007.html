            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  A P R I L  1 1 ,  2 0 0 7Are Subtitled Movies Mainstream?The Times Of London points out that subtitled movies have gonemainstream, but they don't really nail down why. Certainly, thegrowing sophistication of foreign films vis a vis adventure and actionfilms is a big reason. "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" was as great aspectacle as anything Hollywood delivered and horror flicks like "TheEye" traveled well too. But surely the biggest reason movies have gonemainstream is the multiplex. Art films -- and movies with subtitles --aren't relegted to art houses that most people literally never attend. Artfilms, whether talky flicks like "Cache" or action films like 'Curse of theGolden Flower" are at your local multiplex, right along "Borat" and"The 300." And the biggest tipping point of all may have been TV:shows like "Lost" and "Heroes" use subtitles all the time and no oneblinks an eye. Unquestionably, that makes people far more amenable togoing to see subtitled films in the theater. They're not ghettoized intoart houses and people don't freak out at the idea of having to do a littlereading along with their watching.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

1  C O M M E N T S :Fernando (Nerd Gaucho) said...I always found the "debate" with regards to subtitles kinda laugable.Let me explain, I grew up and live down in Argentina (South America,Earth, Solar System ;-).Down here, most of the movies Cable TV channels are subtitles. So wesee Seinfeld in its original English, Friends in its original language, allpopular series in English, subtitled to Spanish. What's the big deal?.People has learned long ago and can manage with subtitles.I once read a news story saying something to the effect that "Americansdislike subtitles, they say they cannot manage to read subtitles andwatch a movie at the same time".No offense, but that reminded me of those "blonde jokes" where thebimbo was "unable to chew gum and breathe at the same time".Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
