7/29/2005 07:53:00 PMHomeland head Michael Chertoff blathers on in a WashingtonPost op-ed. He tries to defend spending so much more moneyon airports instead of other mass transit, admits that moneyshould be targeted even more towards the vulnerable postsand cities (which Bush doesn't do enough of), holds up thehope that some fancy new technology will solve all ourproblems, fobs off most of the responsibility on state and localpeople and then offers this whopper:Finally, catastrophic attacks on mass transit infrastructurehave the potential to kill thousands -- and preventing themmust be a primary focus of federal resources.A "primary focus?" Then why has Bush done so little about trains andsubways and bridges and tunnels? Why is Bush's Congress cuttingback on airport security screeners by almost 15%, as we postedbelow? Thanks to threader aaron for pointing us to this.
