            <p>Newer PostOlder PostS AT U R D AY,  M A R C H  2 5 ,  2 0 0 6"Body Snatchers" -- The Popsurfing ReviewI went to see Invasion of the Body Snatchers last night at Film Forum,which is in the midst of a Don Siegel festival. (It's not exactly packingthem in, but it is fun.) I'd seen Philip Kaufman's remake and found itpretty dull, unlike many friends who think it's terrific. I was sure theoriginal would be fun, but it was GREAT. The few amusingly archaicmoments -- like how our doctor-hero pops pills into patients fasterthan you can say "pod people" -- bring smiles but don't distract. Thetwo leads -- Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter -- are both modestlytalented but have serious chemistry, enjoy the relatively sophisticatedbanter (jokes about both of these divorcees having just come back fromReno) and surely never did better work. The concept is creepy, theexecution so tight and streamlined that you never question it and thepossible takes on what it all means (the Communist threat, suburbanconformity, simple paranoia) are endless and fun. Loved it. FilmForum says the prologue and epilogue were tacked on by the studioagainst Siegal's wishes and some DVD company should present bothversions since it would be so easy to show the bleaker finale withMcCarthy running down the highway screaming that they're alreadyhere. Catch it if you can.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
