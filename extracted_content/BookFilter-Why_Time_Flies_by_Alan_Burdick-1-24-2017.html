From the Publisher: “Time” is the most commonly used noun in the
English language; it’s always on our minds and it advances through everyliving moment. But what is time, exactly? Do children experience it thesame way adults do? Why does it seem to slow down when we’re bored
and speed by as we get older? How and why does time fly? In this witty
and meditative exploration, award-winning author and New Yorker  staff
writer Alan Burdick takes readers on a personal quest to understand howtime gets in us and why we perceive it the way we do. In the company of
scientists, he visits the most accurate clock in the world (which exists only
on paper); discovers that “now” actually happened a split-second ago;finds a twenty-fifth hour in the day; lives in the Arctic to lose all sense oftime; and, for one fleeting moment in a neuroscientist’s lab, even makestime go backward. Why…

What We Say
This wide-ranging survey of the latest ideas about time touches only lightly on popular culture, like HG Wells. Dive into Alan
Burdick's book and you quickly find yourself immersed in talk of circadian rhythms and tales of scientists who sequesterthemselves into caves to see how a lack of sunlight and other triggers play havoc with their sleep cycle and sense of the
passage of time. It's playful, interesting and has as much fun with philosophical questions about time as with the latest
insights of practitioners. The most accurate clock in the world? Apparently, it's just a constantly moving target, with variousmeasurements around the globe averaged out so we can all agree on what time it was a few weeks ago at one particularShare This Book

<p>moment. Time is a hunch, a guess or entirely collapsible at will if you believe the new sci-fi movie "Arrival" starring Amy
Adams. (Aliens scoff at our childish idea of past, present and future, apparently.) Does time fly when you're reading it? Only
if you believe it can. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“Alan Burdick offers a fascinating and searching account of how we perceive time’s passage. It will change the
way you think about the past, and also the present.” - Elizabeth Kolbert, author of The Sixth Extinction
“Alan Burdick turns an obsession with the nature of time into a thrilling quest—one that brilliantly illuminates asubject that haunts us all. Time may fly by  but at least while  reading these pages it is never wasted.” - David
Grann, author of The Lost City of Z
“In his lucid, thoughtful, and beautifully written inquiry about time—what is it, really? Did we invent it, or does
it invent us?—Burdick offers nothing less than a new way of reconsidering what it means to be human.” - Hanya
Yanagihara, author of A Little Life and The People in the Trees
“Burdick tours  that unsettling passage of existence we call “time”—how our brains process it, how infants first

with wonder.” - Robert Sapolsky, author of Why Zebras Donât Get Ulcers
“A marvelous meditation on the subtle mysteries of time.” - Olivia Judson, author…
