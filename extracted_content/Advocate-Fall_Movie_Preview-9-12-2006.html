We interrupt our usual Reviews section to 
bring you a roundup of this fall's arts menu 
FILM 
September 
Hollywoodland (Focus Features) If Brandon 
Routh left you cold as Superman, how 
about Ben Affleck? He plays actor George 
Reeves (TV's Superman) in this look at 
the star's mysterious death. Adrien 
Brody, Diane Lane, and Bob Hoskins 
costar. (Sept. 8) 
The Covenant (Sony) A male The Craft? 
That's our take on this story of four hot 
guys with a supernatural legacy who 
must fight evil. The cast looks very WB 
with names that invite all sorts of jokes: 
Steven Strait, Toby Hemingway, Sebast­
ian Stan, Chace Crawford, and as if all 
that weren't enough, Taylor Kitsch. 
(Sept. 8) 
The Black Dahlia (Universal) Scarlett Jo­
hansson, Hilary Swank, and Mia Kirshn­
er bring voluptuous oomph to this noirish 
THE ADVOCATE tale based on one of Hollywood's leg­
endary murders. Josh Hartnett and 
Aaron Eckhart are the cops who are prob­
ably putty in their hands. (Sept. 15) 
The Queen (Miramax) Helen Mirren looks 
spot-on as Elizabeth II in this intimate 
drama about her relationship with u.K. 
advocate. com prime minister Tony Blair. Stephen 
Frears (Prick Up Your Ears, My Beauti­
ful Laundrette) directs. (Sept. 30) 
Home of Phobia (a.k.a. Freshman Orienta­
tion) (Regent) Sam Huntington (Jimmy 
Olsen of Superman Returns) plays a col­
lege freshman who pretends to be gay in 
a prank to get a hot girl to date him. Out 
actress Heather Matarazzo and John 
Goodman costar. (Sept.) 
October 
Shortbus (ThinkFilm) Writer-director John 
Cameron Mitchell's heady follow-up to 
Hedwig and the Angry Inch is this all­
embracing, envelope-pushing comedy 
about sex and love (in every possible com­
bination) in the fairy-tale New York City 
of our dreams. You'll never think of "The 
Star-spangled Banner" in the same way 
again. (Oct. 6) 
Wrestling With Angels: Playwright Tony 
Kushner (Ocean Releasi ng) Filmmaker 
Freida Lee Mock has a field day with 
Kushner, the endlessly voluble, fascinat­
ing, argumentative, and inspiring 
Pulitzer Prize-winner for Angels in ~ 
S e pte m b e r 1 2, 2 0 0 6 I 55</p>
<p>PREVIEWS 
America. George C. Wolfe, Meryl Streep, 
Tonya Pinkins, Maurice Sendak, and 
many others make an appearance, but 
Kushner is always the center of attention . 
(Oct. 9) 
Running With Scissors (Sony) Augusten 
Burroughs's extravagantly comic tale of 
growing up queer in a very strange house­
hold. [See page 50] (Oct. 11) 
Infamous (Warner Independent) Talk 
about a tough act to follow: In the foot­
steps of Capote, Infamous is also the 
story of the writing of In Cold Blood. 
Toby Jones plays Capote, Sandra Bul­
lock is Harper Lee, and the new Bond 
(Daniel Craig) is the killer Perry Smith. 
In this version, Capote is said to clearly 
fall in love with Perry-and who could 
blame him? (Oct. 13) 
Trade (Lions Gate) German director Marco 
Kreuzpaintner follows his delightfully 
fluffy gay romance Summer Storm with 
this harrowing look at sex trafficking . 
Young Jorge (Cesar Ramos) teams with a 
Texas cop (Kevin Kline) to rescue his little 
sister. (Oct. 13) 
Marie Antoinette (Sony) Maybe she never 
said "Let them eat cake," but Kirsten 
Dunst as the ill-fated royal sure has 
style. Manolo Blahniks fit for a queen 
and great pop songs are just the start in 
this boldly modern, never-dull period 
piece by director Sofia Coppola. Jason 
Schwartzman, Judy Davis, Asia Argento, 
Marianne Faithfull, and Rip Torn have a 
56 September 12, 2006 blast sparring with each other at Ver­
sailles. (Oct. 20). 
November 
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for 
Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kaza­
khstan (Fox) Sacha Baron Cohen (the cre­
ator of Ali G) takes his clueless reporter 
Borat on a road trip throughout the 
United States, never failing to miss an 
opportunity for laughing at gay panic 
from his Eastern European hero. Truly 
silly. (Nov. 3) 
Volver (Sony Classics) Pedro Almodovar is 
at the top of his game in this wonderfully 
satisfying story of a mother (the poised, 
magnificent Penelope Cruz) who covers 
up the murder of her deadbeat husband 
by their daughter. Funny, moving, unex­
pected-it's prime Almodovar. (Nov. 3) 
Fur (Picturehouse) Nicole Kidman is report­
edly magnetic and Oscar-worthy as the 
famed but troubled photographer Diane 
Arbus, who committed suicide in 1971. 
Robert Downey Jr. costars, and Steven 
Shainberg (the kinky Secretary) directs, 
but it's Kidman all the way. (Nov. 10) 
Casino Royale (Sony) A newly imagined, 
tougher, more realistic Bond? Fine, as 
long as they keep the Bond girls coming 
(for the ladies who like lipstick lesbians, 
this time it's the waifish Eva Green) and 
a new Bond (for the men who don't mind 
going undercover). Daniel Craig? We'll 
give him a shot. (Nov. 17) 
advocate .com For Your Consideration (Warner I ndepen­
dent) Another improvised comedy from 
the brilliant Christopher Guest (Waiting 
for Guffman, A Mighty Wind) that's sure 
to be "best in show" for us, especially with 
its focus on actors enjoying the Oscar 
buzz. The cast is bursting with favorites 
like Ricky Gervais, Parker Posey, Eugene 
Levy, Jane Lynch, Catherine O'Hara, 
Harry Shearer, Fred Willard, and many 
more. (Nov. 17) 
Bobby (MGM) Emilio Estevez finally re­
turns to center stage with this Alt­
manesque drama about the 22 people who 
were at the Ambassador Hotel the day 
Bobby Kennedy was assassinated. The 
stellar cast includes Sharon Stone, Elijah 
Wood, Demi Moore, Harry Belafonte, Shia 
LaBeouf, Laurence Fishburne, and many 
more. This is the tantalizing wild card of 
the Oscar season. (Nov. 22) 
The History Boys (Fox Searchlight) Director 
Nicholas Hytner and out writer Alan Ben­
nett bring the Tony-winning charmer to 
the big screen. The winning cast includes 
Richard Griffiths (of Harry Potter and 
Withnail & I fame) in the role of a life­
time, not to mention delightful lads like 
Dominic Cooper, Stephen Campbell 
Moore, and the especially delightful 
Samuel Barnett as Posner. (Nov. 24) 
3 Needles (Wolfe) Out filmmaker Thom 
Fitzgerald directed this movie that con­
nects three different stories-set in rural 
China, a plantation in Africa, and the 
Montreal porn industry-to illustrate the 
face of AIDS today. Made in cooperation 
with the United Nations, but with Sandra 
Oh, Chloe Sevigny, and Olympia Dukakis 
playing nuns, Stockard Channing as the 
mother of a porn star, and Sook-Yin Lee 
of Shortbus, it's sure to be more than just 
noble and informative. (Dec. 1)
