Fahrenheit 9/11 DVD Delay?
by Michael in New York  on 7/26/2004 10:23:00 AM
David posted below about "Fahrenheit 9/11's" possible delay in
coming out on DVD. Here's the latest from Michael Moore himself in aconference call Sunday morning, as reported in Variety. 
"Moore also backed away slightly from his earlier intention to release
"Fahrenheit" on DVD in time for the election. Sony's homevid unit is
close to a distrib deal (Daily Variety, July 7), but Moore said Sunday
that Lions Gate and IFC now say they envision playing the movie
"through the end of the year and possibly into the next year,"suggesting a DVD won't be released until after the pic finishes itstheatrical run. 
"I don't honestly know what's going to happen," Moore said. 
That new scenario would keep "Fahrenheit" in theaters into awardsseason; the film is likely to be a contender for the documentaryOscar (or, as some optimistic partisans have suggested, bestpicture). The Weinsteins then could choose to release the DVD timedto the pic's awards campaign. While delaying the release of the "Fahrenheit" DVD could hurt thetimeliness of the doc, especially if Bush loses the election, it alsowould sidestep Federal Election Commission regulations that wouldhamper the marketing of a DVD. Though the FEC has yet to rule
definitively on the issue, campaign finance rules likely prohibit
mentioning or showing Bush in any broadcast ads for "Fahrenheit" inadvance of the election. Restrictions are lifted after the Nov. 2 vote."
My two cents? Delaying the DVD release till next year would be a
huge financial mistake. People would hold parties to watch the DVD.
People would buy  multiple copies and give them to their friends.
People would delve into the DVD extras to get better informed. Put itout after the elections and you lose all that momentum, that sense ofduty felt by those on the left to support it. Just put out the DVD,then rerelease the film in early January with new footage -- eitherthe happy ending of Bush losing or the "to be continued" ending if hewins. 
You can go to www.michaelmoore.com  and send him an email urging
its release on DVD if you so desire. And you can go to
www.amazon.com  -- which has a massive 500+ reviews of the movie
by readers posted --  and add your post saying the same thing.
