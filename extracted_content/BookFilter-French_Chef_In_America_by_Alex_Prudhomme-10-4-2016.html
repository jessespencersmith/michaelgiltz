What We Say
The subtitle of this biography about the chef, cookbook innovator and TV personality is "Julia Child's Second Act In
America." It's written by the journalist Alex Prud'homme, who also happens to be Child's grand-nephew. They cowrote herdelightful memoir "My Life In France" (which was the basis for one-half -- and the far, far better half -- of the film "Julie &
Julia"). This book does indeed track her life right up to the end, when Child died just days before her 92nd birthday. But in
truth if you have any interest in Child or cooking, you really must read "My Life In France." And if you have, you'll readilyspot "The French Chef In America" as covering much the same territory, albeit with a wider focus. While her memoir wasShare This Book

<p>great fun, it could at times be circumspect and polite about those still living. On his own Prud'homme is far more eager to
give Child her due and perhaps chide others when she would not. That's all well and good and it's nice to hear other voices
and delve further into the impact she had. But what this book lacks to a degree is Child herself, her witty, intelligent and
vivid voice. In fact, perhaps the most useful passages are the ones that DO repeat themselves because Prud'homme gives aslightly different perspective, that is, his own rather than hers. When he ventures into new territory, it feels like we'rebeing loaded up on bread rolls because the main dish simply isn't coming. The first chapter is devoted to how Child endedup doing a TV special on a White House state dinner. Fair enough, for many reasons. But an entire other chapter (the book
only has fourteen of them) is devoted to ANOTHER TV special about a state dinner, this one honoring the Queen Of
England. And this special was a disaster all around, liked by no one and wasn't even her special anyway -- she was just acommentator. Similarly, mini-bios of some notable chefs who crossed her path feel like padding. I was especially eager tohear about her decades-long friendship and TV partnership with Jacques Pépin, but beyond some very mild platitudes, eventhis section was fairly devoid of interest or revealing anecdote. It lacks spice. Prud'homme is convincing when he makes the
case for her vast influence on cooking, grocery stores (and the ingredients they stock), restaurants, TV food shows and
celebrity chefs. But he made that case more convincingly with the more satisfying fare of "My Life In France." -- MichaelGiltz
What Others Say
“Prud’homme deftly chronicles the years after Julia Child left France and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. .
. . As Child’s grandnephew, Prud’homme is able to provide an intimate portrait of Child’s life by sharingphotographs, excerpts of key letters and daily journals, and personal memories. He dishes up the story of Child’slife from the strain of the medical issues she and her husband experienced to the pressures and excitement ofbecoming a trendsetter in televised cooking shows and a household name—in a manner as engaging as Julia Childherself and as delicious as one of her recipes.” — Booklist
“Julia Child’s great-nephew, journalist Alex Prud’homme, treats Child’s ‘second act’ like a carefully crafted
menu. He pays exquisite attention to the details without ever losing sight of the overall experience. The
effervescent Child is alive and well in these pages, which include scenes from her hit TV show, The French Chef,
as well as an intimate look at her boundless relationship with her husband, Paul. . . . The depth ofPrud’homme’s research is evident in the particulars.” — BookPage
“Child’s voice comes through clearly in this affectionate account…
