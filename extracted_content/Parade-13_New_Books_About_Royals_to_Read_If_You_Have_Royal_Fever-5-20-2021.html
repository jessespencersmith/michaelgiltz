            <p>Queen Elizabeth is back in the public eye. Downton Abbey 2 is
already filming. Meghan and Harry are celebrating their third
wedding anniversary—and the imminent arrival of their first girl. And
William and Kate launched another YouTube channel. But if you’re royal
aficionados like us (waiting patiently for The Crown’s return in 2022), it’s
still not enough. For some much-needed royal relief, we’ve rounded up the
romances, tea-spilling diaries, mysteries, biographies, Roman emperors
and even gardening books that are getting the royal treatment this
summer. Here are new books about royals for 2021!
New Books About Royals 2021
New Fiction Books About Royals
Playing The Palace by Paul Rudnick: Self-effacing American event planner
Carter Ogden has certainly never dreamed of marrying a prince, even if he
has just been dumped by a callous actor boyfriend. And yet, the Prince of
Wales is openly gay, very handsome and very determined to see if their
transatlantic tryst might blossom into love. Celebrated humorist Paul
Rudnick (of Whoopi Goldberg’s Sister Act fame) delivers a sweet story
that’s both hilariously funny  and as romantic as any harlequin.

North. Even the doubtful will enjoy this look into scholarly obsession.

New Nonfiction Books About Royals 2021
Elizabeth & Margaret by Andrew Morton: A royal biographer of
unmatched pedigree, Morton will forever be remembered for the
groundbreaking Diana: Her True Story. Here he finds a new angle on the
monarchy by delivering a dual portrait of two sisters, Elizabeth and
Margaret, one the dutiful Queen and the other her wayward sibling.
The Windsor Diaries by Alathea Fitzalan Howard: As bombs fell on
London during World War II, a young Alathea was whisked to relative
safety. The house next door? Windsor Castle. Her new best friends?
Princess Margaret and the warm, awkward Princess Elizabeth, heir to the
throne. They enjoy picnics, parties, outings to the movies and more, all of it
lovingly captured in the diaries Alathea kept for years. This is a rare,
behind-the-scenes glimpse at the young royals.

England’s Magnificent Gardens by Roderick Floud: The story of England’s
rich tradition of gardening is also the story of its monarchy, from the
gardens planted by Charles II in the 1600s to the gardens at Highgrove
personally designed by Prince Charles today. The absurd (William and
Mary lowered their entire gardens—twice!—to improve the view) and the
practical (experiments with greenhouses that led to central heating) are on
display in this unique history.
Hero of Two Worlds by Mike Duncan: If you were born into a life of
privilege, would you risk it all to help those below you? That’s the story of
the Marquis de Lafayette, an aristocrat in France who gambled everything
on the dream of equality. He risked his life during the American Revolution
and then returned to France just in time to overthrow the monarchy.
Lafayette gets his due in this magisterial biography.
