 American Idol  Hollywood Week
Day Two Ratings Grow
Read More:  American Idol , Pop Music , Reality TV, Simon

American Idol  continues to dominate during
Hollywood Week (which lasts two weeks, oddly
enough). You can compare this week to last yearor this week to last year's second night ofHollywood Week, but any way you cut it Idol  is
down a bit but still a monster in the ratings.
According to MediaWeek's Marc Berman,
American Idol  scored a 14.5 rating, which is up
over Tuesday night but down 5% from the samecalendar week last season. By the time you add inDVR watchers, that number will grow and grow.
Berman puts it another way: Idol drew a bigger audience from 8-9 p.m. than all the other fournetworks combined.
How big is Idol ? It's poised to be the #1 show on TV for the fifth straight year and only one other
show in TV history did that: All In The Family  from 1972-1976. No other show has been #1 for five
years in any way. (Scroll halfway down  this Wikipedia entry to see the list of #1 shows by year.) The
Cosby Show and Gunsmoke were #1 for four years in a row. 60 Minutes  was #1 for four years, just
not in a row. That's it. And is there any doubt Idol  will be #1 next season as well? By that standard,
American idol is the biggest TV hit in history. Other records are far away: Gunsmoke  ran for 20
years, 60 Minutes  was in the Top 10 for 23 straight seasons. But still, there's no getting away from
the fact that Idol  is a behemoth.
And a show that big always has controversies. Star Magazine  reports that ringer Joanna Pacitti  has
way  too many ties to Idol producers and a track record that would give anyone pause. When
people complain about contestants who scored a record deal but went nowhere, for example, I
always counter: have you ever heard of them? It's not like Gwen Stefani is getting in line toaudition. But sure, I'm very wary of people who've had substantial success or even shot at success.And Pacitti lived in the same building as two Idol  officials, called one of them her manager and best
friend, appeared on an MTV documentary, had a major label record debut, and had songs played

Suicide Interventionon The Hills  and in movies. It does get pretty ridiculous. And Entertainment Weekly 's Michael
Slezak  weighs in on Idol's penchant for drama by asking succinctly whether you're more interested
in singing or sobbing.
Of all the tweaks they introduced this season, the group performance coming back was the only one
I took issue with. It makes for good reality TV but it has very little or nothing to do with being asolo singer and people regularly are drowned by the distraction of an annoying contestant (likebikini girl or Tatiana) rather than sinking or swimming on their own talent.
My favorite moments last night were not the sobbings and fights, but the (very brief) glimpses of
good performances. The result was the cutting of 29 more people,  including bikini girl, thank
goodness.
The group White Chocolate started the show off in stellar fashion with a terrific performance,
though I did think Justin Williams was pulled through by being linked with the other three,
superior singers. Another stand-out was the group led by Robert Downey Jr. lookalike Danny
Gokey and his buddy Jamar Rogers. They did an outstanding a capella version of Queen's"Somebody To Love."
Jeremy Michael Sarver and Broadway baby Adam Lambert got some air time as well before
making it through.
Of course what I can't help remembering was Tatiana, who is easily the most annoying, tiresome
person on the show (and doesn't seem to have a very good voice, either). She wrecked havoc on twoteams by jumping from one to the other, showed true star potential by making every conversationand discussion about her , kept singing after the judges told her to stop and yet still  got through --
at which point she wept and prayed and thanked Jesus for getting through the round. The horriblynamed Team Compromise had Nathaniel and Kristin and poor Nancy Wilson, who had to endurecrying and weeping from her teammates when all she wanted to do was rehearse, only to forget thewords when they performed Duffy's "Mercy" and watch the two kids go through while she was senthome and then be portrayed as the baddie for being angry with them.
What I won't remember are the performances by a bunch of people I got glimpses of throughout
the night. The final group fighting for the Top 12 slots is bigger than ever (36, I believe) which
means it's even harder for us to get to know them. That may be one reason this season feels so
frustrating. Why oh why don't they just drive tremendous traffic to their website by posting
performances online over the weekend? It's literally impossible for them to create a storyline of
some sort and  show tons of performances in one hour. I get it -- the show would not  be improved
by just showing song after song. But there's no reason to hide those performances from us either.
Did anyone stand out for you? Was anyone sent home that surprised you? Or do you just want to
hiss at Tatiana? (See, I complain about their focus on drama but I can't help talking about her.)

i have never understood why this show continues to do the group thing, unless, of course, it is for the
drama of it all. this is american "idol" not american "idols." then again, it's an easy cattle-call way ofthinning the herd. what bothers me is sometimes some truly talented kids have a terrible time of it withtheir "group," stay up all night, and by morning, they are mentally and physically broken. it's sad to see,not fun, as the producers would like us to believe by their editing.
and frankly, i enjoyed seeing bikini girl jerk the show around on group night(s). i was also a tad
surprised at the attitude taken by the two women on the judges panel (and you know their names)
towards this young woman who was no worse in her schtick than norman gentle was in his. i mean,
really, ladies - you kind of showed your you-know-whats, and if it was supposed to be funny, ahhhh, itwasn't.
the best part of all was when bikini girl refused to play along once she was ousted. i loved that the
most.

Great post Michael. Thanks for the TV stats that put the show in the proper context. Despite dishyblogs on other sites and the always constant "it"s not as good as " comments, it is still one of the most
important shows on TV, in which, unlike other reality shows, the prize is evident and truly life-changing.THAT SAID, Tatiana is so insane, and I find it hard to believe that she got through. The word you used" "frustrating" " is on the money, it was frustrating knowing so little about so many people. THAT SAID, Iam thrilled Adam and India are still there. See you next week! (And I totally agree " Nancy Wilson wasthe only bit of sanity in that trio " she should have stayed or they all should have gone, no matterwhose dream it is.)
