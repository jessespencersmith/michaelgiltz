            <p>T H U R S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  0 2 ,  2 0 0 6Is "Airplane" A Classic Film?Every year, the National Film Registry adds to the list of Americanworks of art in movies/cartoons/documentary footage etc. singled outas the best and most significant. The list is 425 titles strong andincludes everything from "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"(certainly THEIR greatest work outside of "Who's On First") to theZapruder film. The complete list is here. But did you know you canvote? The public doesn't have a direct say, but our voice does holdsway: the more people campaing for a particular title, the more theactual voters might put it in. Here's a very short list of some moviesthat have been nominated but still aren't on the registry. Send an emailwith your votes to sleg@loc.gov. Here's a link to the nomination page.You can include up to 50 titles, but the fewer the better, I'm sure. AndI'm sure prvi8pete will join me in urging everyone to vote for"Airplane." It's a very funny movie, of course, but it's also veryinfluential. Sure, "Kentucky Fried Movie" and others were precursorsto it, but "Airplane" helped popularize a very distinctive form ofcomedy that inspired sequels, knock-offs, TV shows and more. It's rarethat any movie can epitomize an entire genre of films and that's exactlywhat "Airplane" does. Is it a classic film? I say yes. Surely, you agree.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
