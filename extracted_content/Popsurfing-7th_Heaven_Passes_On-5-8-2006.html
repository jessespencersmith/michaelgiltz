            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  M AY  0 8 ,  2 0 0 6"7th Heaven" Passes OnStill the WB's biggest hit, "7th Heaven" says goodbye tonight. Given thelarge cast and how much more money you have to pay actors in along-running hit, it only makes financial sense for the show to end now.But when the WB and UPN combine and suddenly realize theirschedule is a lot weaker than they imagined, they'll miss the fail-safeprogramming of this show on Monday's at 8 p.m. What astonishes meto no end is that its creator Brenda Hampton says every network on theair -- including the WB -- has turned down every family friendly showshe's pitched since "7th Heaven" became an almost instant hit ten yearsago. If the creator behind the longest-running family drama in TVhistory can't get a pilot placed anywhere, that just proves how narrow-minded and stupid network executives truly are. So I'm not surprised"7th Heaven" is ending;, I'm just shocked no one has tried to secureHampton's talents for her next hit.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
