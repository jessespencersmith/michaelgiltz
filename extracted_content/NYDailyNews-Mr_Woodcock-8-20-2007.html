            <p>as it really only been 1 I years
since Billy Bob Thornton burst
onto the scene, afteryears as a
bit player, in "Sling Blade," which
won him an Oscar for screenwrit-
ing? Has it really only been fouryears since he divorcedAngelina Jolie
after wearing vials of each other's blood,
getting tattoos and generally giving the
gossip industry their easiest target until
Lindsay Lohan imploded?
Since getting his big break, the 52-year-
old Thornton has tackled ev-
erything from serious drama
('Monster's Ball') to black
comedy (the cult hit "BadSanta'). But recently the Arkansas traveler
specialized in sports movies, with the 2004
football gem "Friday Night Lights," featur-
ing an inspirational speech that's become a
fan favorite in ballparks around the coun-
try and 2005's "Bad News Bears," charm-
ingly reviving the grumpy grouch played
byWalter Matthau in the original.
So Thornton is perfect for "Mr, Wood-
cock," a comedy opening Sept. 14 abouta motivational speaker (Seann William
Scott) whose mom (Susan Sarandon)
starts dating the high school PE. teacher
(Ihornton) who made his life alivinghell
as a kid. The cast indicates it won't be a
just a dumb spin on "Dodgeball: ATrue
Underdog Story." And Thornton might just
have been born to play the part: his late fa-
ther was a basketball coach in high school
as well as a history teacher. Michael Giltz</p>
