8/02/2005 05:00:00 PMGeorge Bush pretends he supports a "culture of life." But helaunched an unnecessary war (denounced by the Pope as"unjust") and did it on a lie. 1800 US soldiers are dead. Manythousands more are wounded. Bush also turns his back on theslaughter of people in Darfur; he calls it genocide but refusesto act. Millions are starving to death in Niger, but Bush didnothing six months or a year ago when helping to save liveswould have been much cheaper and easier. When the rest ofthe civilized world got together to try and put Africa on theright track by encouraging capitalism, lowering the debt burdenfor countries that are fighting corruption, and overseeing thespending of their own money on mosquito netting and basicmedical supplies, Bush dragged his feet and didn't increasespending by a single penny. Bush could provide access to cleandrinking water to the one billion people of the world who areliterally dying of thirst for just $1.7 billion a year. And he won't.George Bush = culture of death.
