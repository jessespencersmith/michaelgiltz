9/04/2005 06:45:00 PMEchoing our posting "Is This Disaster Natural Or Man-Made?,"the New York Times in an editorial called "Man-Made Disaster"makes clear what many of us have been saying for years: thatBush has cavalierly damaged our nation's security with hisbackdoor draft of the National Guard and Army Reserve.Because Bush abused their trust and went back on the compactbetween this country and those brave volunteers, many fewerretiring soldiers will sign up for these groups in the future(Louisiana is at about 45% short of its goal this year in signingup new recruits). That's going to weaken our nation's securityand ability to respond in case of terrorist attack or naturaldisaster for DECADES to come.Here's the NYT, which adds that obviously ALL the availableGuards should have been activated before the storm struck:Things would have been even worse if a comparabledomestic disaster had struck last year, when an evengreater percentage of National Guard units weredeployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some states hadmore than two-thirds of their Guard forces overseas.After several governors protested, the Pentagonagreed to adjust its force rotations so no state would bestripped of more than half of its guardsmen at any onetime. That promise has been kept so far. But honoring it inthe months ahead will be extremely difficult withactive-duty forces so badly overstretched in Iraq, andprospects for any significant early withdrawals lookingbleak.One lasting lesson that has to be drawn from the GulfCoast's misery is that from now on, the National Guardmust be treated as America's most essentialhomeland security force, not as some kind of militarypiggy bank for the Pentagon to raid for long-termoverseas missions. America clearly needs a largeractive-duty Army. It just as clearly needs ahomeland-based National Guard that's fully prepared andready for any domestic emergency.
