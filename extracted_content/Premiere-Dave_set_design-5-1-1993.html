            <p>THE HOUSE THAT 
'D AVE' BUILT 
ON THE SET 
It was a covert operation that would have done Nixon proud. 
Production designer J. Michael Riva didn't exactly break into the 
White House to take top-secret pictures, but he did leave the presi­
dent's home with a full roll of film and a smile on his face. Riva 
requested but was denied access to photograph the manse so that he 
could duplicate the interiors for Dave, a 
Capraesgue fable starring Kevin Kline as a 
presidenrial look-alik e. Taking up the chal­
lenge, he surrc::ptitiously filmed a White 
House tour with an 8n1111 camera. "I 
wa n't nervous," recalls Riva. "The people 
I was with were nervous. But I've been 
arrested before, so I didn't worry about it." 
Using the precious footage, Riva and his 
design team reproduced the Oval Office 
and the dining room. While the two sets 
are near replicas of their counterparts , the 
outer offices and hallways in Dave are more 
impre sive than the originals. "We exagger­
ated everything," Riva explains. " eeing 
the real White House was a bit of an anti­
climax. You didn't feel like it was substan-tial enough. I t should be oller",helmi/lg." 
When it came to re-creating the view 
from the Oval Office, Riva received 
permission to shoot from the White 
House lawn. "We got this big scissor lift 
and went up to photograph it," he says. 
"But the Secret Service made us take 
everything down two or three times 
because it was the perfect sniper position 
to shoot the president through the living 
room window. We had five policemen, 
two bomb-sniffing dogs, and the Secret 
Service stepping all over everybody's 
jurisdictionl After four days, we did what 
should have taken fifteen minutes to do." 
Sigh. "I've had my fill of Washington."

WHAT CAMELOT BEGOT: "I wanted to mirror the 
Kennedy administration as much as possible, because he 
was my favorite recent president," says Riva of his $90,000 
Oval Office (left). ''The carpets came from the company that 
supplies the White House. We used part Kennedy and part 
Reagan carpets. The telephones are real. We found them in a 
warehouse; they had been purchased from the White House 
for Seven Days in May (1964). I don't know how they did 
that." The real president, hard at work (above).

34 SUITE DREAM S: The faux entryway to the presidential sleeping quar· 
ters (above). "We weren't allowed up there at all," says Riva. In the end, 
they studied videos of a White House tour narrated by Jackie Kennedy.</p>
<p>DEJA VlEW: Riva's sets, 
including the muraled dining 
room (belowl, took six weeks to 
construct. "We left them stand­
ing," says Riva. "Warner Bros. 
kicked in $25,000 or $30,000, 
and now they own them. They 
immediately rented them to In 
the Line of Fire and Hot Shots! 
Part Deux. And they probably 
made twice as much money as 
they put into it." 
'J1O ST TRAP: When those familiar with the White House saw 
Riva's replicas, ''they loved them. The unanimous comment was how 
much nicer it was." The designer conducted a tour of his sets, includ­
the dining room (shown herel. ""'s a maze in the real White 
JOuse," says Riva. ""'s so confusing that even with photographs , ter-
would get lost and .... up ill the room."</p>
