2/11/2005 03:55:00 AMWasn't John great on CNN last night? It began with a ridiculouslead-in that implied this was all about "new media" and liberalsattacking conservatives. But John deftly highlighted the realissues. National security is one good angle: if this guy'sbackground was so shaky he couldn't get credentialed on theHill, how the hell did a guy with a fake name gain access to theWhite House? If they can't keep the White House safe, how canthey keep the country safe? Of course, they knew exactly whohe was -- as the Karl Rove link above makes highly likely.So this is the bigger picture: Bush repeatedly lies and deceivesthe American people via the media. By its own admission, theWhite House has:1. Planted fake news stories on local TV stations to push itsagenda2. Put journalists on the government payroll.3. Had supposed independent journalists testify to Congresswhen they were being paid off by the govt.4. Paid off journalists to push its agenda in the larger media.5. Launched unprecendented tactics to subpoena a number ofreporters and try and force them to reveal confidential sources-- all about a story concerning a White House member whobroke the law by revealing a CIA agent's identity, thusendangering the lives of friends to the US around the world.6. And now, planted fake journalists in the White House pressroom and passed them CIA documents to push its agenda.The latest media manipulation?Bush appeared at the Commerce Department with what hepretended was an independent expert to push his fight againstclass-action lawsuits. That person, Walter E. Dellinger III, is noindependent expert who has seen the light on this issue: heand his law firm are paid lobbyists, receiving $780,000 in thelast few years to push for the legislation. Can you imagine?Bush made a point of saying Dellinger had worked for theClinton Administration -- as if that proved his bona fides -- butdidn't mention the guy was a shill for the people pushing tochange the laws. The President lied. This should be scandalous.But they've done it so often it was blown off in an inside storyin the New York Times.And it worked: the legislation passed the Senate, should passthe House soon and will be signed into law by Bush.
