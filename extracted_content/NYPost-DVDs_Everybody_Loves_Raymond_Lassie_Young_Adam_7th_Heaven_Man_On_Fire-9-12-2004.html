Lassie 50th Television 
Anniversary *** Sony Wonder, $29.98 
''Woof! Woof, woof!" If you 
don't speak dog, that's Lassie 
telling you this DVD set brings 
together 24 classic.episodes 
from all five TV shows starring 
Lassie, not to mention Timmy, 
Jeff, Ranger Corey ane the rest. 
Extras include Lassie at the 
Emmys, on "Dinah Shore," etc. 
Also out is the 1943 tearjerker 
movie that started it all: "Lassie 
Come Home" (Warner Bros., 
$14.96) starring Roddy 
McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor. 
Young Adam ***1/2 . 
Sony Pictures Classics, $24.96 
Like many noir classics, "Young 
Adam" (2003) came and went 
without much fanfare. This tale 
of a drifter (Ewan McGregor) 
falling for the wife (Tilda 
Swinton) of a riverboat captain 
is simply too bleak to win over 
viewers the first time around. 
But the leads are terrific, the 
score by David Byrne 
marvelous, and director David 
Mackenzie is a major talent. 
7th Heaven First 
Season **J/, 
Paramoun. ~t,:....::$c.:::6-,-4.",-99=----___ _ 
Arguably one of the most 
successful family TV shows in 
• Everybody 
Loves Raymond 
First Season *** 
HBO Video, $44.98 
Many great sitcoms take a 
year before they hit their 
stride. "Everybody Loves 
Raymond" fits that 
description to a T, with 
the actors slowly, 
deliciously digging into 
the humor of their 
characters. Modest 
extras include Ray 
Romano's appearance 
on "Letterman" that 
started the ball rolling. 
The exception to the 
rule? "Mork & Mindy First 
(Paramount, 
$38.99), which exploded 
with humor right out of the 
gate, thanks to the 
inventive, original style of 
Robin Williams. 
history, "7th Heaven" is the 
story of the clean-cut but 
quietly sexy Camden kids, led 
by their kind-hearted dad, 
Minister Eric (Stephen Collins). 
No extras, because that would 
be sinful. Just as wholesome, 
really, but pretending to be edgy 
is the well-acted "Everwood 
First Season" (Warner Bros. 
$59.98), which indulges in 
deleted scenes and commentary 
on four key episodes. 
Man On Fire *** Fox, $29.98 ______ _ 
Denzel Washington should 
make a habit of playing against 
type. He won the Oscar for 
"Training Day" as a corrupt cop. 
Here, he's a hired bodyguard 
who 
becomes a 
vicious 
killer 
when 
trying to 
rescue the 
little girl 
he was 
paid to 
protect. 
Washing­
ton is 
terrifically effective and the 
Tony Scott film enjoyed good 
reviews. Less successful in 
tweaking his image is Tom 
Hanks, who suffered a rare 
mixed reception for "The 
Ladykillers'~ (Touchstone, 
$29.99), his larky collaboration 
with the Coen brothers.</p>
