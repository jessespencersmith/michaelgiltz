From the Publisher:
Tretch lives in a very small town where everybody's in everybody else's
business. Which makes it hard for him to be in love with his straight best
friend. For his part, Matt is completely oblivious to the way Tretch feels --and Tretch can't tell whether that makes it better or worse. The problemwith living a lie is that the lie can slowly become your life. For Tretch,
the problem isn't just with Matt. His family has no idea who he really is
and what he's really thinking. The girl at the local bookstore has no cluehow off-base her crush on him is. And the guy at school who's a thorn inTretch's side doesn't realize how close to the truth he's hitting. Tretch hasspent a lot of time dancing alone in his room, but now he's got to step
outside his comfort zone and into the wider world. Because like love, a
true self can rarely be contained.

What We Say
In this sweet-natured, coming of age tale, gay teen Tretch Farm has finally come out to himself. That probably wouldn't
shock most of his family and friends since Tretch loves Tayor Swift, is an awesome dancer, proves creative and kind andeverything else one hopes for in young gay role models. The story and jokes and low-key angst as Tretch gins up the
courage to come out to his brother and then others is indeed familiar, perhaps comfortingly familiar to any teen or their
allies dealing with similar straits. Like many young adult novels in recent years, it also feels overloaded with hot buttonissues. Debut author Will Walton is perhaps doing a little bait and switch -- he keeps us off balance about what the focus ofShare This Book

<p>the book will be after Tretch's gay identity is established. One such item (financial troubles for the family or perhaps their
business partners) isn't even resolved. Not so for many other topics, which run the gamut from cancer to gay dads to school
bullies (who must be hugged) to straight best friends who are so crush-able to aging grandparents to PSTD for veterans and
so on and so forth. Fewer issues handled with more complexity would have been welcome. And a late inning "accident/sort-of-but-not-really suicide attempt" prevented by an unexplained and hard to believe deus ex machina feels way out of placewith the sunny outlook that predominates. Despite the after-school special parade of issues, most of "Anything CouldHappen" is dominated by a breezy, sunny optimism that is very welcome, right down to parents one just knows will be
accepting when Tretch finds the courage to open up. With this big-hearted if ultimately disappointing story out of his
system, Walton might just find the heart to have something more original and prickly and bracing to say. Because heart hedefinitely has. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
Praise for Will Walton's Anything Could Happen :
"Will Walton makes magic in his funny-sad-lovely heartache of a debut novel, Anything Could Happen . Main
character Tretch Farm says it best: ‘There’s sickness, and there’s sadness. But the thing is, there’s love, too.’ So
much love. This book is good. It really is. It really, really is." -- Jennifer Niven, New York Times  bestselling
author of All the Bright Places
"PUSH is proud to introduce a phenomenal debut about the unpredictable, unbearable, and ultimately amazing
trajectory of falling in love and falling into the right place." -- David Levithan
"This coming-of-age contemporary reveals an emotionally poignant story that perfectly captures the trials and
tribulations of adolescence. It's the perfect follow-up read to any John Green novel." -- Buzzfeed
