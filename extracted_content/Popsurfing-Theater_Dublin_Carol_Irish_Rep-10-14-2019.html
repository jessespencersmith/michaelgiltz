THEATER: "Dublin Carol" Hits a Mournful But
Hopeful Note
DUBLIN  CAROL  ** 1/2 out of ****
IRISH  REPERTORY  THEATRE
The new spoof Forbidden  Broadway:  The  Next  Generation  has fun
teasing the recent Broadway drama The  Ferryman.  That show
brimmed over with children and drinking and the Troubles, so
Forbidden  Broadway  sings the question: "What is the state of Irish
drama?" The answer? "Grim, grim, grim."
Well, the Irish Rep tackles what might be playwright Conor
McPherson's idea of a holiday show. You''ll find loads of drinking andtroubles (if not THE Troubles) and the tone is indeed grim, along with
some black humor. But given its setting on Christmas Eve, at least
Dublin  Carol  has the grace to avoid crushing your spirit completely. It
features a small, wavering candle flame of hope at the very end. I'lltake it.
Still, it's no surprise the holiday setting has not fooled Irish Rep into
delivering this play during the actual holidays. Dublin  Carol  ends its
run before Thanksgiving and the Irish Rep offers the enjoyablenonsense of a London  Assurance  revival through the New Year. This is
the sixth play by McPherson revived by the company (including their
exceptional production of The  Weir ). Here's hoping they keep working
their way through his body of work. Maybe a double bill of the one
acts This  Lime  Tree  Bower  and Come  On  Over  is next? And is it too
soon to bring back  The  Night  Alive?  McPherson and the Irish Rep are
lucky to have one another.
Still, this is my first time seeing it and I'm not quite sure what I think
of the play. Or, rather, I'm not sure if it's the play or the productionthat doesn't quite satisfy.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

BOOKS: Don't Bother Trying To</p>
<p>The story is a familiar one, somehow. John Plunkett is a sad wreck of a
man, an alcoholic whose eyes are always darting towards a bottle...orstudiously trying not  to look at a bottle calling to him. He's the senior
man in charge of a funeral parlor while the owner is slowly dying inhospital. It's Christmas Eve, 1999, and John is teaching the new ladMark the ropes. They've just finished working a job and Mark perks upa bit when John insists he was grand, proved a natural at what was
apparently Mark's first assignment. Sitting in a tatty, tired office
decorated with a few modest holiday decorations, Mark sits with Johnfor a few minutes and then makes to go.
John leaps to his feet, offering a cookie, another drink, another task --
anything to keep the lad from leaving him alone. John's story poursout of him: a marriage ruined by drink, a son who is too much like hisdad, a daughter he hasn't seen in years. You've heard it all before.Mark should be off duty but he is dragooned into doing the same jobhe did at the funeral: sitting around looking politely mournful while
other people vent their emotions or struggle not to let go.
In the next scene, John's daughter Mary shows up with painful news.
John's wife is also in hospital and dying. Mary urges him to visit today,assuming he can stay somewhat sober. He can't quite believe his
presence is welcome, but Mary says it is. Soon they're trading painful
tales. Mary describes John's dreadful behavior and then John tops herwith even more self-flagellation. In the show's best moment, Johninsists he can't say he's sorry because that's such a pathetic requestgiven the damage he's done...and then he drops to his knees and begs
for it anyway.
In the third and final scene, Mark returns for his pay but John is too
distraught and too drunk to have bothered with a trip to the bank. Heclings to the lad but is soon alone with his thoughts and memories.
Alone on Christmas Eve, with his daughter soon to return, John
wrestles with the bottle and his desire to maybe take one small steptowards redemption. Maybe, for just a minute, he can play a carol on"Find Me"

<p>the radio, put out some poor excuse for a gift (probably grabbed at the
local chemists) and not screw things up. Maybe.
While the elements may be familiar, there's no reason on God's green
earth that Dublin  Carol  couldn't be so specific it came to life. Or it
might surprise in some way, such as The  Seafarer,  where the Devil
manages to shake up another familiar tale. But Dublin  Carol  does not
offer an unexpected surprise or the shiver of familiarity, the momentwhere you think, "I know this person." Instead you think, "I know thisplay." Still, the tech elements are spot-on and it's directed ably if
without fire by Ciarán O'Reilly.
The cast is fine. Sarah Street has the most detailed and vigorous
character in Mary, a woman who isn't there to condemn or  hold hands.
Cillian Hegarty's Mark is harder to pin down. I've no idea what kind ofperson Mark might be. But it's notable that Mark spends much of theplay listening and Hegarty felt alive and present with nothing more torely on than his own stage presence. I look forward to seeing his nextrole. Jeffrey Bean has by far the biggest part as John, which means heeither lets the play down a tad or reveals its limitations. Still, he's not
bad (cruel compliment, that), just...unsurprising.
That's the same complaint I've made throughout and it holds. Like a
new holiday song hoping for airplay alongside "Jingle Bells" and
"Fairytale Of New York," Dublin  Carol  must compete with the other
strong plays by McPherson, not to mention every drama ever made to
justify its existence. In this production, it strikes a note too similar todistinguish it from so many other shows that have come before.
