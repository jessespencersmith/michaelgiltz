The IRA Top 100 Films Of All Time
The IRA film group I've been a member of for 20 years gathers
annually to name their top movies of the year. You can see our top
picks for 2011 here.  This year -- in conjunction with the every-decade
Sight & Sound poll  (due out in August) -- we made our picks for the top
films of all time.
The final vote over the March 23-25 weekend was the culmination of
months of debate, argument and balloting. First we each watched a
bunch of movies we hadn't seen in years or classics which slipped
through the cracks. Then we made our own personal lists of the Top
100 films of all time. We took all those lists, combined them and came
up with a master list of the 100+ films that got the most votes. Then we
broke ties and narrowed it down to exactly 100 films. I for one had
never seen 20 of them so that meant more movie watching. Finally, on
the big night we took those 100 films ten by ten and re-ranked them
after discussion and debate. So the Top 10 vote getters (movies like The
Magnificent Ambersons, The Searchers  and Vertigo ) were all treated
as a group and ranked from #1 to #10. Then we did the same with the
next batch of ten and so on.
The result? A list none of us are truly happy with, naturally. I bemoan
the lack of animated films and just one documentary that made the cut.
Others are embarrassed by the omission of Bollywood. And so on. But
it's a good list: watch all 100 films and you will have a good grounding
in some classic cinema. It happened for me. I somehow had never
caught director Max Ophuls. Now The Earrings Of Madame De...  is
high on my personal list of the best movies of all time. Same with the
ground-breaking, revelatory Jeanne Dielman.  So debate and mock the
list, but do watch the movies you've never seen before. Enjoy!

Thank you for the List..
I would appreciate it if you could put the year after the name of each
movie, since many remakes are possible.
What does IRA stand for?..
Thanks again

Thanks for commenting. The IRAs are just named after Ira, one of the
founding members. The letters don't stand for anything. I suppose
Psycho has been remade but you can rest assured these are all the
original films. I put a year next to the 1954 A Star Is Born. The only
other confusion might be over Red. That's the 1994 film by the Polish
director.

How many Ira members are there? I am trying to get a mental image of
how big the discussion was? 5? 10? 100?
