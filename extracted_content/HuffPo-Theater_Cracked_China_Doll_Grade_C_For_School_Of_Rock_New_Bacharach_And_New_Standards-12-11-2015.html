SCHOOL OF ROCK  * 1/2 out of **** but *** out of **** on cute scale
NEW YORK ANIMALS  ** 1/2 out of **** 
THE NEW STANDARDS HOLIDAY SHOW *** out of ****
OK, so the theatrical season is ending on a pretty grumpy note, with coal
in the stockings of several shows. Luckily, music comes to the rescue.
Here we go.
CHINA DOLL  * out of ****
GERALD SCHOENFELD THEATRE
Well, no reason to pile on. China Doll  is not a good play. But let's make a
few points: a bad play is a lot harder to memorize than a good play. At
least that's always been my thinking. And even the greats rarely producegreat works of art throughout their careers. Most often, they have a fertile
period of ten to 15 years or so...and then they repeat themselves, plow
the same land with decreasing yields and every once in a while dosomething good that reminds you of why they're great. Not something
great, mind you. But something good.
So David Mamet is not being lazy or indifferent. He's a playwright and
that's what he does. Sure it's been a long time since he delivered a great
one. But asking him not to write plays is like asking Woody Allen to not
make movies. On the other hand, Mamet enjoyed a creative outlet via thecinema since often you need to turn to a new form to find anything new tosay or at least not repeat yourself. Maybe he'll deliver another really good
play or movie someday. But Mamet's great work is behind him andTheater: Cracked "China Doll," A "C" For "School Of Rock," New Bacharach And New Standards</p>
<p>there's no shame in that.
China Doll  feels no more (or less) half-baked than Mamet's other work in
recent years. And a bad play rarely brings out the best in actors. Pacino
was positively brilliant five years ago in The Merchant Of Venice. Is he lost
here? Who wouldn't be? Act one showing a brash 1 percenter looking tododge taxes and maybe get out of dodge with a pretty young wife whilehe still can seemed pretty awful. But act two made act one seem
positively pleasant in retrospect.
The set, the costumes, the sound design -- literally everything seems off
key. But it's hardly worth hashing over. Co-star Christopher Denham has
a secondary role that's blandly anonymous and then inevitably takes aturn. Not the turn one expected, but not a good turn, just hard to believeand uninteresting. The ending is a shocker only in the sense that you can
hardly tell how anyone expects it to play -- seriously, jokingly, tragically,
blackly? I've no idea.
It's all a little sad. One hates to see great artists slog their way through
inferior material. And I marvel at actors who have to go out on stage anddo it all again the next night. It must be a particular circle of hell to bestuck in a show you know isn't going to work. Oddly, I can't wait for them
to tackle something else because a legendary partnership like theirs
should not end on a note like this.
SCHOOL OF ROCK  * 1/2 out of **** but *** out of **** on cute scale
WINTER GARDEN THEATRE
It's a bland xerox of the movie -- right down to the creepily specific
casting of child actors who by and large fit the ethnic roles of their movie
counterparts. The lead actor is doing Jack Black redux. The classic rocksongs (all stolen by Rock Of Ages, apparently) are replaced by bland</p>
<p>Broadway songs posing as rock tunes thanks to the occasional electric
guitar or drum solo.
And if I could invest in it, I would.
Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber hasn't had a hit in the US or UK in at least 20
years. Whistle Down The Wind in 1996 was his last triumph in the WestEnd. Sunset Blvd. was his last hit (of a sort) in the US, though if you wantto talk profitability, one has to go back 30 years to Phantom Of The
Opera. The man who once dominated the boards like no one ever had
before or since has faced a long, long drought.
That drought is over with School Of Rock,  a critic-proof musical that
apparently doesn't need to be critic-proof. (Others seemed to be kind to
it, though I've only heard this second-hand.) It will probably make money
on Broadway and on tour and in the UK. But it's really going to clean up
in school and community productions. In the show, the parents watch
their kids rocking out at the finale with unabashed joy. Imagine the sametaking place in town after town and you'll realize the power of thisshowcase for kids.
If you've seen the movie, you've seen the show, right down to the strong
casting of cute as a button kids jamming out on bass, guitar, drums,keyboards and vocals. Very, very little is different, though a song and
scene or two clarifies how the kids have parents too consumed with work
to pay them much attention. Enter Dewey Finn, a struggling musician whoposes as a substitute teacher at a snooty private school, turns his classof misfits into rock gods and enters the local battle of the bands so they
can bond with their parents and put glitter in their hair at the finale.
Lessons will be learned.
The big change is the music. The foolproof fun of seeing talented kids jam</p>
<p>out on classics (It's cute! I'll admit it.) is replaced by a clutch of originals
with music by Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Glenn Slater, whose best work
is on Disney's Tangled . They are vaguely peppy and rock-ish. True, Lloyd
Webber began by bringing rock to Broadway with Jesus Christ Superstar,but he's always been a traditionalist at heart. (It's no wonder his best
work harkens back to classical music.) His music may be plugged in but
it's resolutely old-fashioned.
No matter. The first act boasts two fun production numbers. "You're In
The Band" is the show's early highlight (and presumably the one they'll
do on the Tony's unless they've lost their minds.) The amiable Alex
Brightman encourages his charges to loosen up and jam out. As each onestruts their stuff, he proclaims "You're in the band!" and the fun buildsand builds. You've also got a faux protest song called "Stick It To The
Man" for another relative barn burner. The songs aren't actually good
(Lloyd Webber is usually good for at least one killer melody a show; not
here). But they get the job done.
However, act two grinds to a halt, with multiple stops for fake
confrontations, the tiresome cliche of a bitchy girlfriend who must be
upbraided by her mousey man and hugs all around at the end. Worst of
all, Sierra Boggess is the uptight principal of the school that the kidsattend. She's a secret fan of Stevie Nicks but (inexplicably) also wandersthe halls belting out opera. She and Dewey go on a date, a snatch of the
Nicks' classic "Edge Of Seventeen" gets the juices flowing...and then
Boggess must warble her way through "Where Did The Rock Go?," theblandest, least rockin' ode to rock and roll in the history of the world. It
would be laughable -- a schmaltzy Broadway ballad bemoaning the
disappearance of "real" rock and roll, if you didn't ache so for Boggess.It's practically her only number, other than a bizarre curtain call reprise ofsome Mozart.
The blandness of act two isn't worth covering, but one crucial example
sticks out. The shy Tomika (Bobbi MacKenzie) rarely speaks and can'tsay what she wants to do in this class project. (Others are musicians or
back-up singers or stylists or roadies and so on.) Our hero asks her what
she wants to be but this mute, mostly sad looking child doesn't knowwhat to say. He says, well let me know and literally forgets about her. It
isn't until act two that she finally speaks up (through no prompting of his)
and says she wants to sing and does. (To prove it, she sings "AmazingGrace," another bizarre musical choice only defended by being in thepublic domain and thus cheap. Otherwise, it makes no sense in a show
embracing rock and roll.) At the end Tomika tells her gay dads (it's that
kind of show) that her teacher inspired and encouraged her. Uh, no hedidn't! Would it have killed the show to have Dewey reach out sweetly</p>
<p>several times to Tomika, trying to draw her out of her shell and showing
his own growth as a person? It's an obvious lapse in the by the numbers
book by Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey  fame.
The audience doesn't care. The production is ugly, the musical choicesbland, the originals anonymous, and most every element just cribs from
the movie. But the kids lock into a song and show their pizazz and the
crowd eats it up. Hell, if I had kids (and I'd already taken them to Matildaand Aladdin and The Lion King), I'd take them to this harmless show aswell. But on the ride home we'd blast Led Zeppelin and The Ramones
and JImi Hendrix, not the score to School Of Rock.
NEW YORK ANIMALS  ** 1/2 out of **** 
NEW OHIO THEATRE
Bedlam is one of the best theater troupes in New York City right now,
smartly inventive and bold. I can't wait for the return of their marvelous
adaptation of Sense And Sensibility  in January, a charmer that deserves to
transfer to Broadway.
Up first is this foray into a musical or to be exact a string of sketches
interspersed by songs. it's more of a song cycle than a full blown show.The New Ohio Theater has been turned into a cabaret and the live band
on stage is excellent. A number of sketches painting the lonely, desperate
lives of New Yorkers follow, brought to life by the five member cast(augmented by a band member once or twice). It's the usual array: aworld weary waitress, a kook that her "friends" both humor and try to
avoid, the lovelorn, married couples fraying at the edge and so on.
Between the sketches, songs are sung by the band.
Steven Sater of Spring Awakening  is the playwright and lyricist. And
something is missing. The cast is strong and each of them has a
particular moment -- or numerous moments -- where they shine andbring these broken people to life. True, the sketches overlap: characters
slowly reveal connections to one another and many of them converge at a
hospital emergency room at the finale. But they don't build, somehow, onone another. Whatever invisible thread is needed to unite them is missing.
Some sketches are stronger than others. But once you feel the inherent
randomness at play here (there could have been five sketches or 15 or50), they become somehow a little exhausting. Without sensing an over-arching structure (however unspoken), our confidence in where the play is
going is lost. I'm not speaking of an Atlman-esque community of folk (in
fact, this show attempts just that) but something subtler and moreessential. I don't know what it is, but it's not here.
Still, the sketches work okay on their own terms thanks to the excellent</p>
<p>cast directed by fellow performer Eric Tucker. But the songs! Sater
collaborated with the great Burt Bacharach, who has enjoyed a creative
renaissance in recent years by collaborating with the likes of ElvisCostello and Ronald Isley. He hits the jackpot again with Sater. Their
songs feature the distinctive, sophisticated arrangements that made
Bacharach famous and lyrics among Sater's best.
And they're put across with aplomb by the band, led by pianist and singer
Debra Barsha and lead singer Jo Lampert, who has great presence and
great chops (and great earrings). It's no small compliment to say they
make these songs sound easy, since Bacharach's tunes rarely are. Butthey're gems. I want to see Lampert in concert, soon. I want to hear thesongs again. I would have purchased a CD with the tunes before leaving
the theater. If this had been a 45 minute cabaret act introducing this as a
song cycle, it would have been a triumph. As it is, you're reminded of the
many talented members of Bedlam even in less than ideal settings. But
mostly you just want to sit back and listen to another song.
THE NEW STANDARDS HOLIDAY SHOW *** out of ****
DAVID RUBENSTEIN ATRIUM AT LINCOLN CENTER
Whew! Just when I felt like a grinch, along come The New Standards  to
put me in a buoyant mood! This Minneapolis super group is composed of
members from beloved indie bands like The Suburbs and Trip
Shakespeare. Their reason for being is establishing the new rockstandards, celebrating the tunes from pop music that deserve being
covered again and again as much as the greats of Tin Pan Alley.
Typically, they do so with their swinging trio of piano (Chan Poling), bass(John Munson) and vibraphone (the geekily sexy Steve Roehm). 
You can
check out their new album right now.
They've also got an annual tradition of doing holiday shows where the
band is augmented with horns and guitar players and backup singers anda passel of friends. It's all goofy fun, with a slightly left of centersensibility giving a wickedly fun but sincere spin to holiday classics. For
their third holiday show in New York City, the band returned to the David
Rubenstein Atrium Of Lincoln Center, a public space filled with freeconcerts throughout the year. It has a slightly bright sound that is lessthan ideal, but it hardly matters with this crowd. The audience arrived
early to secure seats and were clearly returnees bringing along friends to
convert them to the new standards of The New Standards.</p>
<p>They began with New Order but soon plunged into various and sundry
tunes. The fare ranged from "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" to
"I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm." The vibe was very 1950s TV
special (the excellent vibes of Roehm helped), though more traditionaltunes also popped in. Fred Schneider of The B-52s barked out new lyricsto "The 12 Days Of Christmas" in a typically goofy number. Julian
Fleischer was the perfect guest, swinging his way through numerous
standards and bantering with ease. (By his third or fourth number,Fleischer's vocals were truly impressive.)
Chris Koza  (a musician worth checking out in his own right) multi-tasked
by playing guitar, delivering backing vocals, competing with Roehm inlow-key charm, and then stepping forward with one of the night's bestnumbers. He sang "Walking In The Air," from the British TV special TheSnowman.  That Oscar-nominated film is a beloved animation classic in
the UK, played every holiday and akin to its place in popular culture to ACharlie Brown Christmas  here. Frankly, the song is schmaltzy in the
original and when they mentioned this was the song Koza would tackle Iwas wary. But his arrangement and vocals won me over and convinced
there was a genuinely good song hiding under that children's choir. Who
knew?
But as she always does, 
the marvelous Nellie McKay  stole the show.
(Always polite, she handed it right back.) McKay came out in a Dietrich-
like tuxedo and sang a tune in a thick German accent, puzzling but
delighting the uninitiated and thrilling her fans. New lyrics also addedspice when it became a medley. (I think.) She returned later with greenface paint and dressed as a marijuana plant to rap to her song about
wanting weed for Christmas. As she chirped delightfully about the fact
that a huge portion of prisoners in the US are in there for non-violent,marijuana related offenses -- and made it swing! -- all you could do was
smile and declare your love. (And campaign to 
take marijuana off the
federal list of Schedule 1 drugs. )
The band was wonderful throughout. Even when indulging this or that</p>
<p>friend in a number less than luminous, their playing made the evening a
pleasure. Har Mar Superstar got funky and the show proper somehow
ended with the disco classic "Ring My Bell" and it all made sense.
You can catch The New Standards on Saturday December 19 in
Rochester, MN.  Here in NYC, we'll just have to wait until next year.
