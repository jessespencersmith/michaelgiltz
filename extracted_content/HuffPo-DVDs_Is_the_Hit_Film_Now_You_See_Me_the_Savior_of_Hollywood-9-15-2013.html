<p>STORIES  WE  TELL  ($19.99 DVD; Lionsgate) -- Hollywood is "reeling" from a summer
filled with high profile flops like The  Lone  Ranger,  After  Earth  with Will Smith and
R.I.P.D.  (Actually, the summer included record grosses and a strong uptick in ticket sales
but that never stopped people from panicking.) What to do? The truth is that Hollywood
is far less scared about spending $175 million on a potential franchise than it is about
spending $75 million on a movie like Now  You  See  Me.  It's made for adults (though kids
can enjoy it), it has that midrange budget that makes the movie a serious financial risk
without any upside in theme park rides or toys and it's not based on anything people
already know. But then magic happened and Now  You  See  Me  became a worldwide smash
grossing more than $310 million and spawned a sequel. Jesse Eisenberg leads a stellar
cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in a twisty tale about
illusionists pulling off a bank heist. It's filled with enough twists to rival The  Sting  and
audiences responded.
Baz Luhrmann's The  Great  Gatsby  is very similar but with some major pluses. It's geared
towards adults (though kids can enjoy the film and the hip-hop, jazzy soundtrack), it has a
great cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio and it's based on one of the most famous and best-
selling novels of all time. It made almost exactly the same amount of money as Now  You
See  Me  but that movie's a hit and this is a big flop. Why? Because it cost roughly $190
million to make. Why are we discussing budgets? Shouldn't we just be talking about thequality of the film? Well, the movies that are hits and flops financially determine whatmovies get made down the road so movie fans have to care. If The  Great  Gatsby  had been
made for even $100 million, it would be a major hit at least at the box office.Dramatically, it got pilloried. Maybe now people will realize that F. Scott Fitzgerald's noveldoes not lend itself well to dramatization. Please, no miniseries in 20 years!
Of course the answer to Hollywood's summer of high profile flops is not to stop making
franchise films. Man  Of  Steel  was a big hit and Star  Trek  Into  Darkness  was an even
bigger one, given the impact it will have on a potential new Star  Trek  TV series and so on.
This sequel by JJ Abrams is the highest grossing Trek  film of all time, even adjusting for
inflation. I found his first Trek  film to be absolutely terrific, one of the best movies of that
year. For me, the sequel was a disappointment. Not awful, but not nearly as good -- andthe hat tip to 9-11 at the end I frankly found offensive. Guys, it's a Trek  film. Please don't
try and hitch its wagon to important historical events -- sci-fi is always better if we drawthe parallels, not the movie.
So it's not the type  of movies Hollywood makes but the MIX  of movies they make. You
need big rolls of the dice like The  Lone  Ranger  and Star  Trek  Into  Darkness.  You need
films for adults like Now  You  See  Me.  And you need small passion projects like Sarah
Polley's acclaimed documentary Stories  We  Tell.  The actress discovered that she hadn't
been told the truth about who her real biological father was. She set about to interview all
her relatives and family friends as she unraveled this secret and the result is one of themost intriguing and well reviewed movies of the year. It's Polley's second film and she'salready proven herself a significant talent. Hollywood would be wise to bankroll her nextfilm...assuming the budget isn't $225 million.</p>
<p>SHOAH  ($99.99 BluRay; Criterion)
KOCH  ($29.99 DVD; Zeitgeist)
WE  STEAL  SECRETS:  THE  STORY  OF
WIKILEAKS  ($19.99 DVD; Focus) -- Shoah  is
one of the greatest films of all time. It's alsonine hours long and about the Holocaust sothat usually sends most people running in theopposite direction, however noble they considerthe film or the act of remembering. Even forthose that do tackle it, the film is so Significant(and rightly so) it's often treated as more than afilm. Criterion's beautiful packaging of this newBluRay set is a case in point. The sealedpackage contains some discreet rave reviewsbut when you pull off the wrapping you realizethose quotes are printed on the plastic coveringand once it's removed the film is not sullied
with anything as banal as a blurb. It's a classy
touch but a telling one as well. This set is
faultless in its presentation and is bursting with extras like three more films by director
Claude Lanzmann, new interviews and more. But let's set aside the historical weight of
this project for a moment and just consider this as a movie. It's wildly entertaining and Imean that. You are enthralled the moment it begins. It has the bleakest of black humor atmoments, piercing sadness, dramatic revelations, characters you will never forget andmuch much more. If you're like me, you might begin watching with a sense of duty butsoon be on the edge of your seat. By avoiding the "why" and sticking relentlessly to the"how" of the Holocaust, Lanzmann created an endlessly astonishing movie. At the naturalbreak about halfway through, you will be exhausted and wrung out. Do you really want toplunge back in? But the moment you do (be it the next day or the next week) you'll beimmediately mesmerized again. Yes, it's Important and Significant and a Monument. Butdon't worry -- it's also a great movie in every sense of the word. Don't cheat yourself of theexperience of watching it. No, you won't watch it every year a la Casablanca . But I've seen
three times since it came out in 1985 (thanks to a rave from Siskel & Ebert) and I'm sureI'll watch it three times again before I'm done.
No movie can compete with that documentary. But Koch  is a look at one of New York's
most vivid mayors. He's a polarizing figure, thanks to his closeted private life and studied
indifference to AIDS victims because of that fact. (Koch denied this and insisted he wasstraight.) Throw in about a half dozen other issues that New Yorkers can get intoscreaming matches about (transit strikes, endorsing George W. Bush and so on) and</p>
<p>you've got yourself a colorful character. I can't imagine enjoying a documentary film about
Rudy Giuliana or David Dinkins very much, but Koch? Absolutely.
Perhaps instead of waiting for the fictional film about Julian Assange starring Benedict
Cumberbatch you could just dive into the real thing and watch We  Steal  Secrets , the latest
film from the Academy Award winning director of Taxi  To  The  Dark  Side  and Client  9:
The  Rise  and  Fall  Of  Eliot  Spitzer.  Drawing parallels between Assange and Pfc. Chelsea
Manning (born Bradley), it's so of the moment you'll want to peruse recent news storiesfor the latest updates on what's happened to everyone involved.
FROM  UP  ON  POPPY  HILL  ($34.99 BluRay
combo; GKids/Studio Ghibli) BETTY  BOOP:  THE  ESSENTIAL  COLLECTION  VOLUME  1  ($29.99 BluRay; Olive)
THE  PAINTING  ($34.99 BluRay; Gkids/Cinedigm)
THE  MANY  ADVENTURES  OF  WINNIE  THE  POOH  ($36.99 BluRay; Disney) -- It's
heartbreaking news to hear the greatest living animator Hayao Miyazaki is retiring. Hisfinal project is the current release The  Wind  Rises.  He also co-wrote the screenplay for
this film directed by his son Goro. It's set in Yokahama in Japan right before it hosts theOlympic Games -- a typically unexpected subject matter for an animated film. We canhope more ideas and scripts remain to be turned into other projects but if this is the finalbow of the genius behind Spirited  Away  and My  Neighbor  Totoro,  it's a fine send-off.
Miyazaki was probably inspired by Betty Boop, even though they have nothing in common.Many of Miyazaki's films are perfect for kids. Boop broke ground by being a sexy cartoondefinitely geared towards adults, even though kids liked her squeaky voice and catchphrase "Boop-oop-a-doop!" The naughty entendres went over their heads. This is the first
of four volumes; it's not strictly restored but it was nicely mastered for BluRay. The price</p>
<p>is steep for just twelve shorts, but this is a boutique label and enthusiasts are lucky to see
these at all. Still, anyone who wants this will want all four volumes so they should havejust released all 40+ cartoons in one set, even if the price were still as high.
Miyazaki inspired many animators who came after (like the folks at Pixar). Among his
contemporaries is the far less well known French animator Jean-Francois Laguionie. He'sonly made four feature films in his lengthy career but this exceptionally well-reviewed filmis a great capper. The  Painting  is set in an unfinished canvas where the fully drawn
characters in oil lord it over the half-drawn characters who in turn sneer at the"Sketchies." Three of them wander off the canvas into the painter's studio. That echoes theplot of some classic Looney Tunes shorts, but the result here isn't anarchy but moving andfascinating. The  Painting  deserves much more attention than it received here in the US.
Finally, Disney shows you don't need to push boundaries or techniques to create a gem,
just passion and the right approach to the right material. Winnie  The  Pooh  is hand-drawn
but not with the completeness of say Pinocchio . They turn this economizing gesture into a
virtue by having the backdrops look like illustrations in a novel. The result is that you feellike you're watching a storybook come to life, as if you were turning the pages and
suddenly the characters started talking. Combine that with great voice work, charming
songs and the perfect tone and you've got a masterpiece. This BluRay contains the short
"A Day For Eeyore" and more.
PENNY
SERENADE
($29.99BluRay;
Olive)
ONLY  THE
VALIANT($29.99BluRay;Olive)
MY  FAVORITE  SPY  ($24.99 BluRay; Olive) -- It's pure
melodrama but Penny  Serenade  is elevated by the presence of Cary Grant and Irene
Dunne. Still, a soap opera is a soap opera and this weepie has still born babies, difficultadoptions, sudden illness, natural disasters and more. The stars can only do so much,though Grant's scene in a courtroom is a keeper.
Gregory Peck is the hard-bitten military man at the heart of Only  The  Valiant.  He's by the
book and his own men hate him, especially after their favored leader is killed while
following orders. So Peck has more to fear from his own men than the Apaches they'refighting. Good tech credits and a strong cast make this above average.
My favorite Bob Hope movies are surely the Road  films with Bing Crosby. But the My
Favorite...  trilogy ( Blonde,  Brunette  and Spy ) are close behind. In My  Favorite  Spy , two-
bit comic Hope happens to be a dead ringer for a brilliant spy, though all Hope can hear
is the word "dead." Nonetheless, he's suddenly on his way to Tangiers to complete adangerous mission and fall into the arms of the beauitful Hedy Lamarr). There are worseways to go.
THE</p>
<p>OFFICE  SEASON  9  ($59.99 BluRay;
NBC/Universal)
CHICAGO  FIRE  SEASON  ONE  ($44.99
DVD; Universal)PARADE'S  END  ($49.99 BluRay; HBO)
SPARTACUS:  WAR  OF  THE  DAMNED($59.99 BluRay; Starz/Anchor Bay)BLANDINGS  SERIES  1  ($39.99 DVD;
Acorn)DA  VINCI'S  DEMONS  ($54.99 BluRay;
Starz/Anchor Bay)SINBAD  COMPLETE  FIRST  SEASON($34.99 BluRay; BBC/Impossible)REVOLUTION  COMPLETE  FIRSTSEASON ($69.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) --
Like so many hit series, The  Office  overstayed
its welcome. They filmed 201 episodes but the
show was never going to match the brilliance Ricky Gervais achieved in just 12 episodesand two holiday specials. Nonetheless, they did far better than I expected. After twoseasons of struggle, they found their own voice thanks to a great cast led by Steve Carell.If only they'd called it a day after six seasons. Instead they trudged along for nine, evenidiotically continuing when Carell bowed out. Why?
No one will confuse Chicago  Fire  with classic TV. But I love the consistent success of Dick
Wolf. Here you have the week to week pleasures of Law  &  Order  with a more soapy
backdrop. There's enough of an ongoing story to avoid the crisis of the week feel of that
old series Emergency!  And boy are these some good-looking public servants. A nice
diversion.
For my money, writer Ford Maddox Ford's masterpiece is The  Good  Soldier.  But its his
series of novels about World War I dubbed Parade's  End  that has been twice turned into a
miniseries, first in the 1960s and now again with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role.
It was politely received on both sides of the Atlantic but has already seemed to fade a bitfrom memory. Still, if it brings more public attention to Ford -- whose works are oftenlisted among the masterpieces of the 20th century -- then all the better.
The TV series Spartacus  had the absurd idea to take the graphic novel silliness of the
movie 300 and use that template for a TV show. Bizarrely, it worked. The show's visual
boldness has often been overlooked because it was in the service of blood-splattered sex
and violence. Spartacus  also overcame the loss of its charismatic original lead due to
illness. And now its shown the good sense to barrel to a satisfying conclusion in just four</p>
<p>seasons. Well done.
Nothing will top Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry as Jeeves and Wooster. But for those who
can't get enough of PG Wodehouse and silly upper class twits, they might make do withBlandings , a BBC sitcom based on another long-running series of characters by the
humorist. This is a bit broad, but Timothy Spall, Jennifer Saunders and especially JackFarthing (a real find) as the dimwitted Freddie make it worth a look.
If you're a stickler for historical accuracy, run away. But if you just want silly
entertainment, than Da  Vinci's  Demons  might do the tricky. It's stuff and nonsense
nominally (VERY nominally) inspired by the life of Leonardo Da Vinci. On the plus side, ithas Tom Riley as our hero, all sorts of naughtiness and political intrigue, with theoccasional invention thrown in for good measure. On the down side, it really is ratherridiculous.
Sinbad  is sort of a poor man's Hercules  or Xena , if there can be such a thing. To enjoy Da
Vinci's  Demons  you must turn your brain off. To enjoy Sinbad , you must throw it away.
Finally, there's Revolution , a new NBC drama. Like so many shows of the past few years,
you feel like you have to start taking notes during the first episode just to follow
everything that's going on. I'm happy to enjoy complex plotting, but it shouldn't feel likehomework. Not for me.
