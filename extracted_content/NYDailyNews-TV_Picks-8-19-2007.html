            <p>ollywood loves comedies and disaster movies, and
there's no better way to combine the two than by
showing people on vacation, desperate to relax but
failing at it "Mr. Bean's Holiday," opening Friday, has
British comic Rowan Atkinson's mostly silent title clown
separating a father and son while on holiday in France, then
trying to reunite them and wreaking havoc along the way.
Film buffs might recognize the nod to 1953's "M. Hulot's

Anival: Murray overpacks the tics in
this comedy of discomfort, making difector
Frank Oz's lark a little too dark. ri 'f i
I RV (2006)
IDestination: Robin Williams is a guy 3" 'l
who has to navigate his career, and a lohg
overdue family bonding session, while
driving a rentbd behemoth to a conference.
Animl: A hit, but that massive,
