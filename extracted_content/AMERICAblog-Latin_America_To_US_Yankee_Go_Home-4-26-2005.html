4/26/2005 02:25:00 PMWhile the Middle East remains a quagmire, the rest of theworld gets little attention from Bush. Not Africa, which is inturmoil thanks to a plague Bush refuses to use the bestmedical advice to combat. And certainly not Central and SouthAmerica.USA Today has a thoughtful lead editorial looking at how fragiledemocracy is in that once promising region. The clock is rollingback in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and on andon.Certainly Venezuela is shaky. Its leader Hugo Chavez justkicked out the US military, ending a 35 year old relationship.Now why is the leftist Chavez angry at the US? Oh yeah, that'sright. About the only action Bush took in the last five yearssouth of our border was to SUPPORT A MILITARY COUP tooverthrow the democratically elected Chavez. Democracy is onthe move, except when Bush wants to support a dictatorshipthat spreads nuclear weapson and know-how (Pakistan), amonarcy that spreads terrorism (Saudi Arabia) or just hates ademocratically lected leader that won't kowtow to the US andso supports the military thugs who want to thwart the will ofthe people (Venezuela). And we wonder why people around theworld don't buy Bush's rhetoric.Finally, nearly a million people in Mexico marched to supportthe mayor of Mexico City. He may be a populist, he may be aleftist, but he represents the will of the Mexican people. Wannabet Bush hates him and will snub him whenever Bush gets thechance?Ah, democracy. Ain't it inconvenient, Mr. President?
