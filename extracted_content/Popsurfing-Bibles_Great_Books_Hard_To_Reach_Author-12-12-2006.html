            <p>T U E S D AY,  D E C E M B E R  1 2 ,  2 0 0 6Bibles: Great Books, Hard To Reach AuthorWhenever someone tells me they believe in the Bible as the literal wordof God, I always ask: which one? Personally, I've got some 20+ booksfeaturing entire translations of the Bible and different translations ofFive Books of Moses, the Book Of Job, the Psalms and so on. The NewYorker has a very good article about the Bible publishing industry andthe explosion of specialized versions geared towards fans of particularpreachers and so on. One silly example: a magazine-style version of theBible geared towards teen girls:The result was “Revolve,” a New Testament that lookedindistinguishable from a glossy girls’ magazine. The 2007edition features cover lines like “Guys Speak Their Minds” and“Do U Rush to Crush?” Inside, the Gospels are surrounded byquizzes, photos of beaming teen-agers, and sidebars offeringBible-themed beauty secrets:Have you ever had a white stain appear underneath the arms ofyour favorite dark blouse? Don’t freak out. You can quickly givedeodorant spots the boot. Just grab a spare toothbrush, dampenwith a little water and liquid soap, and gently scrub until thestain fades away. As you wash away the stain, praise God forcleansing us from all the wrong things we have done. (1 John1:9)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

4  C O M M E N T S :priv8pete said...Well, as one of the people you know you believes the Bible to be theWord of God I'd say I believe the Old Testament written in Hebrew andthe New Testament written in Greek. Since my Hebrew and Greek leavemuch to be desired, I read a literal translation (usually NewInternational or King James) and consult commentaries to betterunderstand the grammatical structure in the original texts.4:16 PM
