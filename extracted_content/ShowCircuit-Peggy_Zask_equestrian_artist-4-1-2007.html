Horse Sense
Artist and educator Peggy Zask shares her love
of all things equine with her students.
By Michael Giltz
STUDENTS AT the Mira Costa High School in Manhattan
Beach, CA, do not have to struggle to figure out how to create
a project that pleases artist/educator Peggy Zask. If the subject
includes a flowing mane and about 1,000 pounds of pulsating
muscle, chances are they are on the right track.
"I battled the horse stigma fbr a long time," relates Zask,
who lives on the edge of a nature preserve overlooking the Pa-
cific in Rancho Palos Verdes. "I draw horses constantly. Then I
started sculpting them and I decided: This is what I need to
do. I keep trying to frgure out what is this symbolizing? Why
am I doing this? I just crave the perfection and expression and
the beauty and spirit of a horse."
Zask, lvho seerns fhted to teach in a school where the mas-
cot is a lvlustang, appreciates the resltrgence of funding for the
.rrts under Gov. Ar nold Schwarzenegger. "We're getting huge
;-rmounts of money fi-om Califbrniir because Schwarzenegger
decided to bring the arts back, so we're fightir-rg over lour
r;hare]. It's allowing ns to hire elementary school art teachers,
rvhich makes a big diff-erence ."
Always firing up a clay sculpttrre rrnd inspiring her students
rver the possibilities of art, sl're l-ras rvot'ked with str.rdents to cre-
:rte a massive mural (10' x 50' feet rvicle) clecorating one lvall of
sHow_crRculr (65 spRrruc zo'olthe school and adorned with countless stallions. Her love of
equestrian art has also driven her to found and curate the an-
nual Spirit of the Horse exhibit every spring in her town.
It is only fitting since Zask grew up around the animals.
"My dad was a real estate agent in the'70s when it was a good
thing," the artist explains. "My mom had the Rolling Hills
General Store-a little country store-so I helped her with
that. We owned three horses and we had a half acre and cor-
rals and a barn. My first horse was Poco. He was about 30
years old and really slow. When I was seven they pr,rt me on
him, and I went on from there."
Now her Iove for the creatures has been passed on to Zask's
daughter. "My daughter has a thoroughbred named Mikey
fnamed after MikeyWay from of the rock band My Chemical
Romance] and she's into jumping. She's on the equestrian
team at her high school and she's taking it to the next step.
Oh, it's scary," the proud mother laughs, "especially jumping. I
can barely watch. We're right on the edge of a nature preserve
so we have a lot of land. There's a barn that's parent-run, but
the teenage girls keep their horses there and do all the care
and maintenance and management.
'Are you familiar with the Pony Club? It started in England
but it's here in America too, and we belong to the Portuguese
Bend Pony Club. They compete against each other, but it's
more of a nurturing, responsibility, growth and goal-oriented
Igroup] than competing in big shows. These girls, when they
get to the top ratings, they know as much as any veterinarian
about caring for these animals. It's a good organization; nry
d:rughter loves it."
Zask prefers to draw from memory instead of photographs
or live models when creating her sculptures. "l just finished

Surf by Zask and students;

maintains a website at peg-
gyzask.com. "It's maybe thlee
f-eet tall by fbur feet long. I
built it in pieces, and I'm
wiring it together. My first
horses were really cautious
becar-rse I dicln't know if I
conld clo their long skinny
Iegs. They're a churllenge. I
love llre ch.rllenge ol getting
them to survive. I feel like my
