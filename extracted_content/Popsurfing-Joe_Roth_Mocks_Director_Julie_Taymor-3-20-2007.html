            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  M A R C H  2 0 ,  2 0 0 7Joe Roth Mocks Director Julie TaymorIn a New York Times article about a creative struggle over the newJulie Taymor movie "Across The Universe," producer/director JoeRoth mocks the artist. The movie uses songs by the Beatles to tell awacky, almost surreal tale of two star-crossed lovers -- it sounds artyand awful, frankly. But Taymor has a 128 minute version and producerJoe Roth went behind her back to cut a 98 minute version and test itwith audiences. First, he acts as if it's standard operating procedure forstudios to take over a movie and cut out half an hour to produce theirown cut. Sure, it happens, but it's hardly a given. Roth acts as if Taymoris an idiot for not knowing this. Taymor doesn't comment for thearticle, but her people released a very politic, reasonable statement.Roth on the other hand, won't shut up. Then Roth endears himself towomen everywhere by saying Taymor is overreacting and refers to her"hysteria," because of course women can't have creative differenceswithout being emotionally unhinged. Frankly, having seen Taymor'smovies I'm sure the movie is opaque and arty. What the hell did Rothexpect from her? And he's behaving like a prick.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
