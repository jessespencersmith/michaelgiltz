Four more contestants were eliminated on American
Idol:  Katelyn Epperly, Todrick Hall, Alex Lambert and
Lilly Scott. So this is the Top 12, the performers whoget to go on tour and -- no matter how soon they'reeliminated -- get a shot at a career of some sort. (Has
anyone in the Top 24 who didn't make the Top 12 ever
made a name for themselves?)
TOP 12
(in order of announcing on the show)
1. Didi Benami
2. Siobhan Magnus3. Paige Miles
4. Casey James
5. Tim Urban6. Lee Dewyze
7. Crystal Bowersox
8. Michael Lynche9. Lacey Brown10. Aaron Kelly
11. Andrew Garcia
12. Katie Stevens
I had a pretty good night prediction-wise: I predicted the bottom four of the women perfectly,but
thought Katie Stevens would go home instead of Lilly Scott. I only predicted three of the four men in thebottom four (I thought Aaron would be in it, rather than Lee) and again only nailed one of the men going
home, since I thought Andrew would go home instead of Alex.

<p>The night began with another godawful lip-sync, this time of a Michael Buble song. Then we were told
"breaking news" -- the theme of the Top 12 performance night will be the music of the Rolling Stones. (I
immediately started wondering what song would be good for Crystal.) Even better, they're going to makethe playlists of songs that the contestants choose from available on iTunes. This gives the fans a lot moreto think about. iTunes lists 50 songs that the Top 12 can choose from. Assuming these are the only songs
they get to select from, we have a much better insight into the options they're given and how smart they
are in their choice.
Then the Top 12 was slowly announced. Paige Miles and Katelyn Epperly faced off, with a resigned
Katelyn going home and Paige heaving a huge sigh of relief (as I predicted). Todrick Hall and Lee Dewyzefaced off, with Todrick still sporting the fingerless gloves that probably spelled his doom. (Todrick alsogave a strong goodbye performance; he just needs a stylist.) Alex Lambert and Andrew Garcia faced off
and Alex was devastated by being sent home. He was genuinely heartbroken, frustrated that he didn't
have the confidence to show his talent to the fullest. That was followed by a dueling pianos rendition of
Billy Joel's "Tell Her About It" (one of my favorite songs of his) by last season's Scott McIntyre and Matt
Giraud. After it was over, I wondered which one would be going home. (My pick would have been Scott.)Finally Katie and Lilly faced off and Lilly was sent home, to the astonishment of everyone.
So now we know the Top 12 and the playlist of 50 Rolling Stones songs they get to choose from. Here's
your chance to help your favorites on the show. Which song would you recommend they sing (and how, if
you think they need to give it a new arrangement).

24 Fanstreatment this year? I'd hate for him to get his hands on Crystal and wreck her like he did Bo Bice.
Absolutely . Let it Bleed would be great for Crystal. And if she got away with singing "You
can come all over me" it would be the funniest thing since Andrew Garcia's "I'm a genie in
a bottle/You gotta rub me the right way."
Ah ... Andrew? Heads up. No one watching wants to rub you the right way, the wrong way,
or any way.
Please.
I bet no one sings Let It Blleed Or Start Me Up for those very reason. You make a
dead man come? Not gonna happen. Clive davis probably can't stay away, thoughthey'd make more money by putting her with T-Bone.
Is it too early to pick our Top 3, America? Crystal Bowersox, Michael Lynch, Siobhan Magnus.
Here are the songs I would like to see them do:Crystal -- Tumbling Dice
Michael -- Emotional RescueSiobhan -- Can't You Hear Me Knocking
I bet though Siobhan will opt for Gimme Shelter (read: Mary Clayton, "It's just a shot away ...") so
she can cater to the judges' infantile request for another "moment" like she had with the big screamin the Aretha Franklin song. I wish they would shut up and just let the girl sing. They're gonna ruin itfor all of us by trying to groom her. I think she's the most dynamic and interestin g singer in the
competitio n.
Spelling correction : MERRY Clayton sang on "Gimme Shelter."
No biggie. They got it wrong on the original album notes, too.
Didi could do an indi version of "Wild Horses" like the Indigo Girls did once at a concert I attended.There's also another female artist that has done it recently (not Susan Boyle). 
I'll be interested to see what Crystal does - she is suited to this genre - hope she changes it up aFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

"satisfact ion" for Lee
"Wild horses " for Michael
"Angie" for Casey (keep to the original version)I like Andrew but can't figure out what Stones song he would sound good doing, Same goes for thewomen.
I see the rumors about Ellen having the lighting changed and softened was true, she looked less
ghostly, but still really added nothing to the show for me. LOVED it when Simon said that Kara'scomment about the song having to relate to the singers life was "Rubbish". No wonder all of Kara'ssongs are about breaking up with a boyfriend. What a weird liminted provincial view she has ofmusic.
I'd be embarrasse d if I were one of the judges or producers of the show. Bobby Sherman's
performanc e of Hallelujah was so horrid and shallow I thought he'd be mugged instead of hugged.
Then again, I do Not find Ellen "adorable" as a judge of music or singing. I find her way more
annoying than Paula ever was- and she was useless.
This past show was a wakeup call- tit's all a big joke- anyone can lose, anyone can win. Whose
records are you gonna buy- if any? Simon's leaving, so this is my last season watching. It's moreaggravatin g now than entertaini ng. Then again- the only thing watching on TV on New Years Eve is
Kathy Griffin- certainly no music. Truthfully , I'd rather watch Guy Lombardo than the Black Eyes
Peas or Carrie Underwood. And he's Way before my time!
Bobby Sherman! That was funny and spot-on.
I've been seeing outrage all over the place (such as Entertainm ent Weekly) and I have to
ask...why? I really appreciate people who can sing well or have a unique sound and I just did notget the whole Alex Lambert thing. He had an ok voice but especially the other night, I just didn't buyit. He didn't connect to what he was singing.
I'm surprised more people haven't picked up on the complete double standards the judges have for
the men and women. Katie and Aaron are both young singers with older voices and presences.Aaron gets commended for singing songs that are arguable too old for him and does not get thetalking down that Katie received every week about "singing her age" and "appearing young".Permalink  | Share it

2 FansI think Aaron got grief for that too, such as when he sang "I'm Already There." With his
country vibe, I think it's just that Aaron sort of knows better what works for him. They'redefinitely struggling with Katie, but I don't think it's because she's a girl.
Both Alex and Lilly deserved Top 12. Both had a chance to go further into the program than eitherAndrew or Katie - neither of whom will win American Idol. Alex has a unique voice - a soulful voice,if you will, for such a young guy. Let's hope a record producer will recognize that and develop thiskid. He needs guidance and seasoning - and I hope he doesn't give up any aspiration s for
becoming a profession al singer and recording artist.
To better understand "American Idol" and how it works I ask the following question. 
BOBBY SHERMAN or JIM CROCE? WHICH ONE WOULD ADVANCE FURTHER ON "AMERICAN IDOL?" (Now of course I'm assuming you're old enough to remember who Bobby Sherman and Jim Croce
were and so I'll skip describing who these men were and what they were as performers )
So who would win?...... ... Obviously it would be Bobby Sherman. 
I know, I know, Jim Croce had more talent, was a better artist, and Dawg never sounded pitchy inhis life!
But the Jim Croce's of the world are not what "American Idol" is all about. Never has been and
never will be. 
The Idol is about the Bobby Sherman's of the world, and I'm not writing this to be cynical or
anything like that. 
We may not admit it, but we all have a place in our collective hearts and souls for a Bobby
Sherman and the type of entertainm ent that he represents . 
That's why the Lilly Scott's of the world never quite make it and why someone like Paige Miles andher wholesome good-looks and image just might beat out someone like Crystal Bowersox. 
IS IT FAIR? Well, it is only entertainm ent so one shouldn't really take it all seriously in the first place. 
Or in other words; 
Easy come, easy go.
Sad ,but true. Simon should consider doing a show that would find and expose talent like
Jim Croce or Roger Hodgson,Dy lan and so on...not just assembly line music. They could
do the American Idol type interviews and auditions, but the contestant s must all audition
with a song they themselves wrote.Ther e should be no age limit, just anyone over 16 and
unknown. Each week they would have to come on with a new song they have written,wh ich
at that point could have some help from good and establishe d song writers and musicians.
That's a show I could watch without having to make the excuse " My kids make me watch itwith them" :)Permalink  | Share it

3 FansAnd if you had a show which catered to the Jim Croce's and the Bob Dylan's of
the world I guarantee you it would be a snooze-fes t........ Those prison shows on
MSNBC would get higher ratings than watching some guy sing a song he wroteabout his time in Denver.
There are More Comments on this Thread. Click Here To See them All
You might try Nashville Star if you like country music. There is no age limit andthey perform at least one original song, which is often the week that cements awinner.
I definitely agree that a lot of artists wouldn't do well on Idol. However, for those that do,Idol is a great platform. I haven't seen Bobby Sherman talk too much so no idea how hedoes on camera. Jim Croce I have even less impression of as a personalit y. But Bob Dylan
for example was a handsome devil, very quick-witt ed and has a wide appreciati on for all
sorts of genres. If Idol were on in the Sixties, he would have done great, gritted his teethduring the obligatory album deal and then gone off on his own to fame and fortune.
It is definitely a travesty since the voters didn't vote that way. The producers chose this, they areallowed to ignore the voters as they make sure to disclaimer in the credits. Theres far too much atstake, its a number one show. The advertisin g revenue comes first and the producers needed a Top
12 that would target as many advertisin g demographi cs as possible.
Tim, There is little to no chance the show rigs the results and ignores the votes. The mainreason? There's no point. The drama of who the viewers do and don't pick is far moreexciting than any choices they could make. If the producers were picking, Adam Lambertwould have won last year, the chubby Ruben Studdard would never have won Season Twoover dorky but lovable Clay Aiken and on and on. The disclaimer refers to their reasonableability to eliminate computeriz ed voting or any voting via phone and text they decide
violates reasonable understand ing of what should be allowed That's to more accurately
reflect the voting of fans, not to ignore it. A hundred computers with software shouldn't beable to decide the winner; that's all they want to avoid.
I think if next week we hear Andrew does another acoustic rendition of something (probably a songoriginally sung by a girl) American will know they've made a grave mistake, lets hope he surprisesus.
OMG what a travesty!! ! Alex Lambert really had the most unique voice with real potential. An Lilly
who came as a surprise to everyone. I can't believe it but I think it wasn't a surprise to me. He had
some of the lowest online fan base which goes to show why people who lets be honest don't stillbelong there like Tim Urban and sadly also Andrew Garcia who have a ridiculous ly huge fan base.
Same with Lily who just didn't have much of an online presence. Permalink  | Share it

<p>Goes to show people should have been more active in spreading the world online to support their
favorites. No one to blame but yourselves . Studies done by Baduku show that Baduku and Twitter
fan base have been the most accurate when it comes to defining the top 12. http://www .baduku.co
