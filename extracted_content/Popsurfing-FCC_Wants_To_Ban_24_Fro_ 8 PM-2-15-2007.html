            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 7FCC Wants To Ban "24" From 8 P.M.The FCC wants to be your mommy. The FCC already has absurdlydraconian fines for over-the-air speech that have vague guidelines andunpredictable results, thanks to Congress. (PBS stations are literallyafraid to air a Ken Burns documentary on WW II because of a few straysalty words that -- if the FCC decided they were offensive -- could putthe stations out of business. Do you really think kids are going to sitthrough a 10+ hour documentary in the hope of hearing "shit" or"fuck?") Now the FCC is asking Congress to let it censor violence aswell. It wants to decide what you can watch and when. The result?Shows like "24" -- which just aired from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. this Monday,would be relegated to 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. (Oh wait, FOX doesn't AIRshows at 10 p.m.) This ignores the simple fact that with cable, parentscan freely block any and every channel they want to. And of coursethere is more programming available of all sorts 24 hours a day. If youwant access to wholesome family programming (however you definethat), you can easily get it 24 hours a day on dozens of channels. Whatexactly is the FCC protecting you from? Yourself. One Senator behindthis drive? John McCain.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
