Come From Away: Welcome to the Rock — An Inside Look at the Hit Musical 
Book, music, and lyrics by Irene Sankoff and David HeinText by Laurence Maslon$40, Hachette BooksPublished September 24
The Canadian musical Come From Away  is an honest-to-goodness smash hit, a word-of-mouth
phenomenon. Created by two relative neophytes, this feel-good story with a somber 9/11
backdrop was conceived with the hope that maybe it would become a mainstay in the town ofGander, Newfoundland, where locals opened their homes and hearts to stranded airlinepassengers whose flights were diverted on that dark day. And, the creators thought, maybesome community theatres in Canada would someday stage it too?

<p>Instead, this little-musical-that-could played to rapturous reviews in Toronto, opened on
Broadway, and scored seven Tony nominations, including Best Musical (winning for Best
Direction). In London, it won the Best New Musical Olivier, and more companies are set to tour itall over the world. Come From Away  passed the magical 1,000  performance mark on
Broadway, and by the end of the year it will be one of the 100 longest-running shows inBroadway history.
It’s a charmer in every way, so fans will be sure to snap up this keepsake. Welcome to the Rock
includes the complete book and lyrics, of course, but there’s much more.
You’ll also find an introduction by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who charmingly
introduced the show when it previewed on Broadway. The main text includes the usual behind-the-scenes stories of how the show was made and creative insights from the talent involved. Butit also includes new interviews with the passengers and Gander residents who came togetherthat memorable and sad day, finding comfort in their shared humanity.
That tribute to the real people who inspired this show elevates Welcome to the Rock,  just as it
elevates the musical in the minds of the fans and critics who have embraced it all along.
