stage, in film, on TV and in her personal life.Under'
While pregnant last year, the 29-year-old actress
made her Broadway debut opposite MarkRuffalo inthe
Clifford Odets revival "Awake and Sing!" InJanuary, she
gave birth to her son, Orson. Last summeq, she starred in
Shakespeare in the Park's "Romeo & Juliet," which gar-
nered Ambrose great reviews.
On Friday, she'll be seen as an ambitious graduate
student who latches on to her writing idol @layedbird" when she was I l, she has "a problem with au-
thority." So how did Andrew Morgan, director of "Eve-
ning," win her confidence?*Andrew is very passionate about his work, and this
movie in particular," says Ambrose, who married her
husband, Sam Handel, a photographe4 in 2001. "I re-
membertalking to him about it and he was weeping
when talking about doing this fllm. I've noticed that
the people who make the best movies are the
ones who are really passionate."
Ambrose felt a kinship with her charac-
ter, Heather, a young woman who is sort
of a less-poisonous Eve Harrington: She
woos editors, writers and others who
can advance her desire to become a
writer herself. (-angella's Leonard
Schiller is an obscure, ailing writer
she persuades to let her interview him
at length for a thesis on his work.) But
Heather doesn't ty and take advan-
tage of people's kindness so much as
use their knowledge and utiilize it.
In the same way, Ambrose used
being a new mother to bring pas-
sion to the all-consuming love
of "Romeo & Juliet."
"He's the real Romeo,"
says Ambrose of her
son. "And I was able to
use [pregnancy] and
having a baby as Juliet.
You use things in your
life, and Shakespeare
can hold all that."by Frank langella) in "Starting Out in the Eve.
ning." It follows a busy "'ns when she gave a
vocalperformance as a "wildthing" inthe
Spike Jonze movie'Where the Wild Things
Are," plays Jeff Bridges' daughter in the
upcoming "A Dog Yea4" and taped epi-
sodes ofthe sitcom "The Return ofJezeb-
el James" with Parker Posev.
'I don't think I will ever say 'I know
what I'm doing,'" says AmbroSe, who
first gained notice in the 1998 teen
comedy "Cap't Hardly Wait. " "Ev-
ery job that I get, everytime I start, I
think,'Okay, l' m definitc$ getting
fired from this.' Because ev-
ery actor gets fired some-
time, and I haven't yet.
So everyacting job
for me is like starti4g
from scratch. It's an
exercise in faith."
And an exercise in
trust: Ambrose says
that, thanks to an im-
pressionable reading
of "To Kill a Mocking-</p>
