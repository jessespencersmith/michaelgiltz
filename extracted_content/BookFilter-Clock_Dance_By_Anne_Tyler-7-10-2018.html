proposal. In 1997, she is a young widow trying to piece her life backtogether. And in 2017, she yearns to be a grandmother but isn't sure sheever will be. Then, one day, Willa receives a startling phone call from a
stranger. Without fully understanding why, she flies across the country to
Baltimore to look after a young woman she's never met, her nine-year-olddaughter, and their dog, Airplane. This impulsive decision will lead Willainto uncharted territory--surrounded by eccentric neighbors who treateach other like family, she finds solace and fulfillment in unexpected
places. A bewitching novel of hope and transformation, Clock Dance  gives

What We Say
The latest Anne Tyler novel is -- I believe -- my first Anne Tyler novel, after years of eying her ever-growing stack of
acclaimed novels. Where to begin, I wondered? The answer, finally, is here. The story is modest in a very appealingmanner. Its rather intriguing structure begins with two little sisters who have a patient father and an abusive mother. It
jumps forward in time to college and a startlingly abrupt marriage and then jumps again and again in short bursts until we
arrive at 2017 with two-thirds of the novel still to come. One of those little girls is Willa, now the very accommodatingwife of her second husband, Peter. A woman she's never heard of calls out of the blue and demands Willa come toShare This Book

<p>Baltimore and take care of Willa's daughter in law and granddaughter. Actually, the girl is not Willa's daughter in law and
the little girl is not her granddaughter. Willa's son dated the woman briefly but the child isn't his and Willa has never even
met them. Nonetheless, the young woman was shot (shot!) and is in the hospital and the little girl is alone and this
neighbor is at her wit's end. For reasons even she can't explain, Willa heads to Baltimore even though none of this hasanything to do with her. Willa's husband Peter grumpily joins her; Willa is so unassuming one can imagine he felt she simplywasn't capable of the journey on her own. (Airplane flights, driving, strangers -- it's all a bit much.) Why does Willa do it?And why is she so happy befriending Denise (the ex her son dumped for the wife of another neighbor, it turns out) and
Denise's pre-teen daughter Cheryl? Everyone has an idea and shares it with Willa. But it's surely nice to be needed and Willa
hasn't felt needed or appreciated in a long time. Tyler has an almost invisible presence here, though she does have a giftfor ending chapters with a sting, a final line that tilts your perspective or unsettles you or provides a moment of grace.(Like a classic New Yorker short story, I'd say.) By and large, you simply see the people in this world along with thethousand and one accommodations they make in life, sometimes a thousand and one in an hour, it seems. "Clock Dance"
passed effortlessly and with pleasure and yet, it mattered too. Not knowing Tyler, I wasn't sure if this was the sort of book
that might involve dramatic changes at the end or whether that sort of thing just wasn't done in Tyler-land. The finale wassatisfying but I'd suggest it runs exactly two paragraphs too long. Tyler found the perfect ending and then -- who can blameher? -- offered up a coda with a showy simile as a sort of curtain bow. I haven't a clue as to whether long-time fans will
see this as a triumph or just more of the same, which would be just fine after some 22 novels. I do know I'll be reading
more. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“A stellar addition to Tyler’s prodigious catalogue . . . A bittersweet, hope-filled look at two quirky families that
have broken apart and are trying to find their way back to one another . . . The cast of sharply drawn charactersdominates in ways both reflective and raucous across a series of emotional events.”
—Publishers Weekly (starred, boxed)
 “Tyler, a master of honey enchantment and sly social evisceration whose storytelling finesse has propelled more
than 20 novels, now delivers an especially lithe and enlivening tale . . . Tyler’s bedazzling yet fathoms-deep feel-good novel is wrought with nimble humor, intricate understanding of emotions and family, place and community—and bounteous pleasure in quirkiness, discovery, and renewal . . . Ensnaring . . . Quintessential Tyler . . .Brilliant, charming, and book-club-ready.”—Donna Seaman, Booklist (starred)
“Tyler’s characteristic warmth and affection for her characters are engaging as ever. . . [They are] all vibrantly
portrayed with her usual low-key gusto and bracingly dark humor . . . Power dynamics are never simple in
Tyler’s portraits of marriage.”  —Kirkus Reviews
