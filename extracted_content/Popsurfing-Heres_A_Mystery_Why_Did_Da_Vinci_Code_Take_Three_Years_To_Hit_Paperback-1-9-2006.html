            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6Here's A Mystery: Why Did "Da Vinci Code" TakeThree Years To Hit Paperback?Anchor Books announced today they'd print up some 5 millionpaperback copies of Dan Brown's runaway bestseller "The Da VinciCode" for its March 28 release. The movie version -- starring TomHanks -- comes out May 19. Frankly, if the movie wasn't coming out,they might never have released a paperback. The publishing industry isin a slump (though still a $20 billion business) and they wouldn't agreewith me, but one big reason is paperbacks.DVD sales exploded because they offered better quality at a lower pricethan VHS. But in the book world, they delay a paperback's releaseagain and again and charge more and more for them. Instead ofdesigning attractive "mass market" paperbacks at inexpensive prices,publishers push "trade paperbacks" that cost some $14-$16. Massmarket editions (often about $6 or $7) come out years after ahardcover's release, if at all.Publishers do everything they can to make those editions seem junkyand unappealing, only suitable for airplane reads. It's even morefrustrating for evergreen titles -- how frustrating is it to look up a 20year old novel and find out it's only in trade and costs $17 dollars?And they wonder why people aren't snapping up books. So are any ofyou latecomers going to (finally) read "Da Vinci" when it comes out inpaperback?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
