ROMEO & JULIET  * 1/2 out of ****
CLASSIC STAGE COMPANY
It seemed we would be getting two Romeo & Juliet  productions this season what with
Orlando Bloom on Broadway tackling the Bard in a muddled mess and the usually
dependable Classic Stage Company showcasing actress Elizabeth Olsen in theirversion. But in fact we get to see about 10 or 12 versions, since every actor on stage
at CSC seems to be in a different show.
It was a troubled production from the start with the first Romeo bowing out for film and
William Hurt -- who surely could dive back into theater in any show he wanted if he's
going to go for a limited run Off Off Broadway -- stepping away as well. All involvedsurely wish they'd pulled the plug. But none of that excuses the non-direction of TeaAlagic that neither reins in the actors or gives them anything focused to do.
Among the many ideas scattered about are the costumes of Clint Ramos, which
suggest that Juliet's Capulets are a tacky, nouveau riche family while Romeo'sMontagues are aristocracy. None of this is brought out any further than the leopardprint top donned by Lady Capulet (Kathryn Meisle). A splash of orange light literallydivides the stage in two at the beginning to separate the two warring factions but thattoo is soon dropped. There's a hint of multi-cultural melting pot, what with numerousactors delivering lines early on in Spanish, Italian and Russian (I think?) though thisidea is also discarded. Other thoughts come and go just as quickly.
You do know the story? Two families are bitter enemies but their only children fall
madly in love. The parents refuse to countenance such a match, passions rise,
Romeo is banished and the kids concoct a crazy scheme that goes dreadfully awry.
Since her credits list only two parts as an understudy, I assume this is actress
Elizabeth Olsen's theatrical debut in New York City, if not ever. If she were surrounded
by an excellent cast, Olsen would have fared better. Her talent on film (especially thevery interesting Martha Marcy May Marlene ) is evident and she might well have the
makings of a stage actress. Certainly she has some good moments here and there,both when addressing the audience and interacting with her family.
Olsen is less in luck when sharing the stage with Romeo. Actor Julian Cihi was
plucked out of nowhere for the part, an unfortunate bit of casting that does him nofavors. He gestures aggressively with his hands (and even his head, leaning forwardand jutting out at times), over-emotes, over-enunciates and fails to find a moment torelax where we can identify with him. Of all the young actors on tap in New York City,how did they alight on him? (The casting is by Calleri Casting though this last-minutereplacement was surely a group effort.) One feels sorry for Cihi, which is not the sortof thing one should be mulling over during a romantic tragedy.
Mercutio is usually a sure-fire scene stealer, but both productions have stumbled
even here. On Broadway, Chrisitan Camargo is desperately trying to liven things up.Here, the marvelous stage actor T.R. Knight seems to have decided Mercutio is
having a nervous breakdown. Or perhaps it was just Knight's reaction to this
production. In either case, it's to be hoped we'll see him again soon in somethingbetter.
Two actors out of all this keep their dignity. Daphne Rubin-Vega creates a fully
realized comic spin on the Nurse as a Latina. It's funny, convincing and -- given theproceedings -- a miracle. The Nurse is usually a delight but here she's a life-line.Watching Rubin-Vega coerce Juliet into giving her a back rub or teasing outinformation reminds you this is actually a good play. And watching Olsen play off ofRubin-Vega lets you see what she might become with more stage work.
The other triumph is Daniel Davis as Friar Laurence, though it's a two-edged sword.
He replaced William Hurt and delivers his lines in the King's English with clarity andpurpose. Unfortunately, his character dominates by being so well-performed thatwhen the poor Friar reveals the bungled plot that led to the twin suicides of RomeoMay 14, 2014

<p>and Juliet you want to string him up yourself. This is all your fault, one can't help but
think.
Of course the real tragedy is the entire show. Never was a story of more woe, but in
this and the Broadway production, it's for all the wrong reasons.
A NIGHT WITH JANIS JOPLIN  ** out of ****
LYCEUM THEATRE
Well, they got one thing right. Mary Bridget Davies is a dead ringer for Janis Joplin.
Her singing and even her speaking nail down the particulars of that legendary rockerto the nth degree. I've never understood the appeal of tribute bands. I'd love to see
Led Zeppelin but I don't have the slightest interest in seeing some guys ape Led
Zeppelin. Nonetheless, with this crack band on stage and Davies on lead vocals, fun
could be had in a rock venue where you can stand and dance along and drink a beerwhile they crashed though a 60 minute set of Joplin's best. Indeed, B.B. King's is avery sterile, suburban-mall of a music venue, but I can imagine even the show theyput on there for the press was pretty fun.
Unfortunately, what we have here is a two and a half hour set stretched out over twoacts and filled with rambling asides by Joplin that reveal almost nothing about her wedidn't know already. She explained at least five or six times what the blues are --they're a hole, a vacuum, the not having something you really want to have and onand on and on. Joplin tells us she listened to a Bessie Smith record and it changedher life. But so did going to the library. And so did finding the art books in the library.And so did playing on stage with an electric band for the first time. You get the drift.
These meaningless asides are literally non-stop. Except for a medley, I don't think we
ever heard two songs in a row without stopping to hear Joplin mutter something about
how her mom played lots of cast albums or she worked a lot of odd jobs. Even worse,
many of the songs she does sing are truncated.
Knowing that her catalog of well-known tunes is pretty thin, writer-director Randy
Johnson came up with the idea of peopling the show with Joplin's many influences.An excellent quartet of singers -- dubbed the Joplinaires -- provide backup and alsoget to shine as such iconic figures as Odetta, Aretha Franklin, Etta James, BessieSmith and so on. Dance captain Taprena Michelle Augustine is simply vocally andphysically miscast as Smith but she shines on "Today I Sing The Blues." AllisonBlackwell triumphs doing a spin on Leontyne Price's "Summertime"and almost as wellplaying the Queen of Soul Franklin in what I believe is an imaginary duet on "Spirit InThe Dark." De'adre Aziza has fun as the regal Nina Simone and Odetta while NikkiKimbrough wails nicely as James.
They are the show's not-so secret weapon, giving Davies frequent breaks from the
throat-tearing wails of Joplin without pausing the music. But god forbid anymomentum build; the moment that threatens to happen they stop for yet anotherunrevealing anecdote. I've no idea why Joplin's influences/forebears are singing theBob Dylan classic "I Shall Be Released" but it seemed like the big finale for those
singers and cried out for Davies to join them onstage, with Joplin and her idols united
in song. Instead, that's followed by an oddly desultory "Me and Bobby McGee."
The show usually knows a show stopper when it's got one and Davies is given a
pause so fans can clamor after a faithful rendition of "Summertime" or "Down On Me"or "Piece Of My Heart." Weirdly, the vocal blast of "I Shall Be Released" in the secondact is followed by her sole #1 hit, the Kris Kristofferson-penned "Bobby McGee" andit's tossed off indifferently and falls flat. That's followed by a song written specificallyfor Joplin by one of her favorite songwriters, Jerry Ragovoy. Called "I'm Gonna RockMy Way To Heaven," it was intended for Joplin's next solo album; unfortunately it's farfrom his best and the song is reprised again unnecessarily right towards the end.</p>
<p>Even the inevitable sing-along of "Mercedes Benz" feels a little off, with Davies in a
rare vocal misstep sounding a little harsh and high-pitched.
If you lifted out the musical moments, cut the numbers that didn't work and woke up
"Me and Bobby McGee" (whose flatness is the real puzzler here) you'd have a finetribute to Joplin and her influences that might run 80 minutes and play well in a rockvenue. But on Broadway, padded out and slowed down, it's a drag that the real Janiswouldn't have sat still for.
