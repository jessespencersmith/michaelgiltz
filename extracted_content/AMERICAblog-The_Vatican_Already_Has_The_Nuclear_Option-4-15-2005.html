4/15/2005 05:58:00 PMMaybe Frist is taking his cues from the late pontiff John Paul II.I'm currently reading "Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind theScenes of Papal Death and Succession" by John-Peter Pham(Oxford Univ. Press). It's a great primer for the conclavebeginning Monday that will elect the next Pope of the roughlyone billion Catholics in the world.JP II was already disappointingly conservative to me and ofcourse I despair of a liberal Pope coming out of a conclavewhere 99% of the voters were put there by him. But as if thatweren't safeguard enough, I find out that "in a radicaldeparture from previous legislation" JP II instituted the nuclearoption.Fiddling with the rules of the conclave is a perennial pasttimeof pontiffs, but one long-term tradition is that the Pope mustreceive a vote from two-thirds plus one of the cardinalspresent. So if there were 90 voters, they'd keep working at ituntil 61 voted for one candidate. But JP II changed that. Ifafter 10 to 12 days of voting a new Pope hasn't been elected(not an unusual amount of time for this process, by the way),then a simple majority of 50% plus one will prevail.This change from a "super-majority" to a simple majority hasall the pitfalls in a Pope that we've considered for a SupremeCourt Justice -- rather than switching to a candidate that hasbroader support, a core group of a simple majority canpotentially elect someone who is vehemently opposed byalmost half of the people present.Knowing this, of course, cardinals might be far less willing tocompromise -- why bother when they can have their way ifthey just wait long enough, even if it means electing anextremely divisive pontiff?In the past, a dragged out conclave usually meant acompromise candidate -- ie less extreme -- was going to cometo the fore. Now it means the exact opposite. So the longer ittakes, the more worried moderate, Vatican II loving Catholicslike myself will be.
