10/27/2004 01:25:00 PMA rising tide of opinion -- both in articles and editorial columns -- saysthat the Presidential election will not be decided on election day. Toomany provisional ballots, too many absentee ballots, too manyelectronic voting machines that could break down, and too manylawyers."But because those [provisional] ballots will have to be consideredone by one, there is a real possibility that the outcome of thepresidential election will not be known on the morning of Nov. 3 andthat it will again turn on court decisions, say election law specialiststracking more than a half-dozen thorny legal issues in the swingstates," says the New York Times.Of course, we've been telling you this for weeks now. But wheneveryone agrees with us, it's time to reconsider. With Kerry gainingmomentum every day and with YOU promising to go to the polls andtake ten friends with you, Kerry is going to outperform the polls andwin handily by the popular vote and electoral vote and all theseproblems -- which must be resolved by 2008 -- will be minor hasslesinstead of president-deciding factors.
