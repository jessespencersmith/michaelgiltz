Like pornography, an unnecessary movie remake is hard to define - but you know it when you see
it. A remake of Citizen Kane  would be ludicrous. So would a remake of Casablanca . (Though that
hasn't stopped them from trying to spin off not one but two TV series based on that classic wartimeromance.)
On the other hand, no one is going to top Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood, but that
character is so iconic it seems perfectly natural for each generation to give it a shot. Same withSuperman, Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan - great figures in pop culture are just irresistible. If theoriginal had a clever premise but didn't really deliver - think Ocean's 11  or The Thomas Crown
Affair - you've got another reason to green light a remake.
Then there's the perfect little movie that resists anyidiotic idea to improve or update it. The classic, trimlittle western 3:10 To Yuma  is a perfect example. The
1957 original ($19.94; Sony) is as tight as a drum,with Glenn Ford never better as the quietly menacingoutlaw and Van Helfin (never particularly good any
other time) just perfect as the stolid rancher who steps in to guard the bad guy and shepherd himto the train station and eventual justice.
Fifty years later, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale reprise those roles ($29.95; Lionsgate). The
movie is beefed up with a little more travel, a little more violence and a little more unnecessarystabs at psychological depth. Anyone who hasn't seen the original might think it's fine. But thosewho have can't help but think it's utterly pointless. Why remake a brilliant, specific, nigh on perfectmovie that simply couldn't be improved on?
Probably no one has defended The Invasion  ($28.98; Warner Bros.), the Nicole Kidman and Daniel
Craig remake of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers out Tuesday. I have friends who really like the

"HGTV's $250,000
Challenge": Families
Vie For Mortgage...1978 remake by director Philip Kaufman. But even before I saw the original, I found that version a
little slow and unconvincing, even though the premise of "pod people" appealed to my inner
Twilight Zone geek.
Then I saw the 1956 original, which I'd always heard was a great B movie, a great low budget sci-fi
flick, a great metaphor for the McCarthy witch hunts and/or Communism itself, a great spin on
Fifties conformity or take your pick. Forget all that. When I finally saw the original at a revival
house, all I saw was a great, great movie. It's gripping, creepy, funny, utterly involving and with a
dramatic ending that ranks among the most memorable in movie history. I'd gladly tackle a new
Tarzan movie tomorrow and not worry in the least about comparisons with the past. But why
would anyone want to remake a gem like this that's already perfect?
Also out: some boxed sets, including 4 By Agnes Varda  ($99.95; Criterion), featuring Vagabond
and Cleo From 5 to 7  along with loads of extras; The John Frankenheimer Collection  ($39.98;
MGM), a grab bag with one masterpiece ( The Manchurian Candidate ), one blast of fun ( The
Train ), one decent courtroom drama ( The Young Savages ) and one good car chase ( Ronin ); two
celebrations of straight-to-DVD franchises American Pie - The Threesome Pack  ($39.98;
Universal) and Bring It On - The Cheerbook Collection ($44.98; Universal) and hey, if you weren't
buying and renting them, they wouldn't keep making 'em; Monty Python's Life Of Brian: The
Immaculate Edition  ($24.96; Sony), out Tuesday, a silly romp through religion ("Blessed are the
cheese makers?") that only sounds offensive to people who haven't bothered to see it; Swamp
Thing: The Series  ($39.98; Shout), the surprisingly durable DC comic chararacter's transfer to TV
(though it's hard not to miss Adrienne Barbeau); Strindberg's Miss Julie  ($39.95; Criterion), in a
1951 Swedish version I'd never heard of but which is renowned; The Odd Couple: The Third
Season  ($38.99; Paramount), a sitcom that balances perfectly on the edge of silliness and
repetition without ever losing sight of the genuine characters at the heart of it all; Make Room ForDaddy Season 6  ($39.99; S'more), starring Danny Thomas in the tail-end of one of sitcoms's
defining early hits; Lars Von Trier's The Kingdom Series Two ($29.99; Koch Lorber), a spooky,hospital-set supernatural drama (think Dark Shadows meets ER), which I find murky but some
horror buffs absolutely love; The Rock's thoroughly unexpected switch to inoffensive familycomedy is complete with the box office hit The Game Plan ($29.99; Disney); Galactica 1980($29.98; Universal), the jaw-droppingly awful attempt to reboot the original series by findingEarth; and Barney Miller: Second Season ($29.95; Sony), a sterling TV series that for many yearswas the one TV show that cops insisted got it right - forget Hill Street Blues and Homicide  and
Adam-12  and NYPD Blue, for the day-to-day life of a cop this charmer nailed it.
And here are my favorite movies of 2007:
1. The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford
2. Lars and the Real Girl
3. Zodiac
4. The Wind That Shakes The Barley
5. There Will Be Blood
6. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
7. L'Iceberg
8. Michael Clayton
9. Ratatouille
10. Once
11. The Host
12. This Is England
13. Superbad
14. Control
15. The Bourne Ultimatum
So what's your favorite remake? The most pointless?

The greatest remake of all time? Easy. It's "The Maltese Falcon." Hammett's novel was shot not once
but twice before John Huston's 1941 remake. Huston's version so completely overshadows the first twothat people don't even think of it as a remake. (When "The Maltese Falcon" comes up in a discussionof great films, no one asks "Which version?") All these years later, it still sparkles. It's the film equivalent
to Hammett's prose (detective story as art), but there isn't a dull or self-indulgent frame in the entire
picture. Truly the third time was the charm.
As for the worst: I'll second, or third, the motion: Burton's "Planet of the Apes" was the most inept major
motion picture I ever paid money to see. It wasn't released, it escaped.

My least favorite movie of all time is Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, with Ethan Hawke, Julia Stiles, andBill Murray all falling flat on their faces trying to pull of Gen-X Shakespeare and failing more miserablythan I can possibly describe. I guess you'd call it a remake.

I like old film noir movies. I made the mistake of seeing the remake of "D.O.A." some years ago. Thathelped to avoid the mistake of seeing the remake of "Gun Crazy" during the five minutes it was inmovie theaters. By all accounts I made the right choice.

You appear to know more about this than I Michael, but I find the Scorsese Cape Fear a little more
suspenseful and interesting to watch than the original.
I feel Psycho should have been left alone though. Too perfect to mess with.

favorite: Scorsese's version of "Cape Fear". 
most pointless: Gus Van Sant's do-over of "Psycho".

Most pointless I've recently heard about but hasn't yet been released (Phew!): The Day the Earth StoodStill - another 50's classic sci-fi movie
Favorite Remake: 12 Monkeys (a remake of a French film "La Jetee") The original was a classic, shot
except for maybe one scene as a slideshow. The classic status alone makes a whole lot of critics
cringe at Terry Gillam's remake, but I think he updated the film nicely. It's still a mess, but an enjoyable
one with Bruce Willis cast as the reluctant anti-hero and a Brad Pitt as his psychotic antagonist.

" Planet of the Apes", and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"( Willy Wonka was the original's title )were both pointless exercises in narcissim for Tim Burton. Why he felt the need to invade suchsacrosanct territory, whilst removing the best moments from each film is, well, typical.
One of the greatest moments in the original " Planet of the Apes" happened when Taylor, the astronaut
played by Charlton Heston is finally caught, netted and strung up. Hampered by strained vocal chords
up until that point he utters the words which shock the monkeys into silence. " Get your stinking paws
off me you damned dirty ape." A fine fine cinematic moment, which Tim Burton sought to ignore, as well
as the appearance of the Statue of Liberty on the beach. Why remake a story and remove the best
parts?
So too with " Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". Although Burton's version adheres to the Dahl story
in some instances, like the reveal that Charlie has won the Chocolate factory which in the book is not avery dramatic moment. He simply looks down and sees that all the other children have been weededout, fallen into chocolate rivers, or turned into fruit, then says...oh, you're left. okay, the factory's yours.
The brilliance of the screenplay and movie version was in Charlie's returning of the gobstopper to the
desk of Willy Wonka, a redemptive even heroic moment which sets him apart from the rest of hisgreedy selfish gluttonous ilk, earning him the keys to the factory. Burton's adherence to the book, whileaccurate fell flat onscreen. Plus he added a bunch on nonsense with Willy Wonka's backstory,something entirely unnecessary as Charlie Bucket was the protagonist, and Wonka the bit of cinematicinvention who needs no explanation.
