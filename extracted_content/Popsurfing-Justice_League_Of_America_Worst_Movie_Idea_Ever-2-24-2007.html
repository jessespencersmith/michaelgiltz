            <p>S AT U R D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 4 ,  2 0 0 7Justice League Of America: Worst Movie Idea EverWarner Bros. has taken its first major step to bringing the JusticeLeague of America to the big screen by hiring screenwriters. What aterrible idea. The JLA has always been a popular comic book andvirtually every DC hero has been a member at one point or another. Butthe core group is Superman and Batman and Aquaman and the Flashand Green Lantern and Wonder Woman. The 70s cartoon version wasalways super hokey and it's impossible to think of a feature filmfeaturing all of them that wouldn't seem ludicrous on eight differentlevels. Plus, how would the directors behind the next Batman andSuperman films feel about seeing their characters thrown into the mix?They couldn't make JLA without Supe and Batman but including themwould cheapen the other already active franchises. Plus this derails theobvious franchise of a solo Wonder Woman movie -- which should be aperiod piece or it'll be ludicrous, by the way. There's only one context inwhich the JLA makes sense and that's on TV. It's already a de factothread on "Smallville" and a spin-off of the JLA featuring hotteen/young adult versions of these characters figuring out how to worktogether and beat the bad guys is low risk and does no real damage tofeature film versions. But a movie? "Fantastic Four" was bad enough,wasn't it?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...You're right -- if it was gonna work at all, it would have to be ananimated feature. That's the only way we could see all thesesuperheroes coexisting without just giggling.5:09 PM
