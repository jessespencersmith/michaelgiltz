<p>The Queen's Palaces  ($19.98; BBC/Warner Bros.)
The Diamond Queen  ($19.98; BBC/Warner Bros.)
Sherlock: Season Two  ($39.98 Blu-ray; BBC) -- Have you been soaking up all the hoopla over Queen
Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee? Well, until they release a DVD set of all the goings-on in the UK, here
are some other titles to tide you over. The Queen's Palaces  is strictly for hardcore monarchists and
people who love stately homes. It delves into the history and current treasures they contain. TheDiamond Queen  is appealing to far more casual Anglophiles, using the reign of the Queen as a way into
the story of the UK throughout much of the 20th century and beyond. And if you just want to soak upLondon, check out the modern updating of Sherlock Holmes with Benedict Cumberbatch and MartinFreeman very good indeed as the detective and his sidekick Dr. Watson in Sherlock: Season Two.Frankly, I'm not wowed by it as a drama on its own terms, but they're having fun and the contemporarytwists on the plot elements of the original stories are often clever. if you're not going to read the ConanDoyle stories or watch Jeremy Brett for the umpteenth time, by all means enjoy.

13 Movies That Changed
The Way We View Poverty</p>
<p>Being John Malkovich  ($29.95; Criterion)
Certified Copy  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- I've always found BJM  a little too self-consciously quirky
to embrace it fully. But that shouldn't obscure what a truly bizarro idea for a movie this is, with people
able to take over the body of actor John Malkovich for minutes at time just the beginning of the
absurdity. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman had a field day with this one and Criterion does justice to
what is now a very notable film indeed. You get a new documentary about the film, Malkovich
interviewed by John Hodgman, short films, a look at puppeteering and more. I was also less enamored of
Certified Copy  than most, mainly because I found opera star William Shimell stiff and boring. If you can't
wake up when acting next to the luminous Juliette Binoche, buddy, check your pulse. Still, like BJM , this
is an intriguingly high concept project from the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami with Binoche
and Shimell playing lovers or perhaps playing people who are playing at being lovers. The extras includea real treat: The Report , an extremely rare 1977 film by Kiarostami that was his second feature and which
starred Shohreh Aghdashloo (of 24  fame). It's a scratchy, lo-fi print but since this festival award winner
has been unseen and virtually unavailable (the original negative was destroyed during the IranianRevolution), it's wonderful to catch up one this major director's early work.

<p>This Means War  ($39.99 Blu-ray; Fox)
Red Tails  ($39.99 BluRay; LucasFilm/Fox)
Man on a Ledge  ($30.49 Blu-ray; Summit)
Goon ($34.98 Blu-ray; Magnolia) -- Four disappointing movies. This Means War  may the biggest
disappointment since I found the premise so clever and commercial. Two spies who use all their wiles
and all the technology at their disposal to try and woo the same woman -- now THAT'S a Hollywoodmovie. Plus, I was looking forward to seeing Chris Pine prove his star power after breaking out in StarTrek . But what a dreadful, dumb, lazy film they produced from all those promising materials (which also
include cute as a button Reese Witherspoon and cute as a... well, not a button, but perhaps cute as acuddly toy Tom Hardy as Pine's rival. Really, the level of stupidity and wasted opportunity was high evenby LA standards. George Lucas certainly had good intentions when making Red Tails,  the story of black
American heroes who fought as fighter pilots in WWII. Lucas clearly spent a lot more energy on thefrenetic aerial battles instead of the script. Obviously he forgot long ago that special effects do not a
movie make. Man On A Ledge  costars Jamie Bell, one of the best young actors around. But this
complicated and unsatisfying thriller is yet another example of his poor taste in commercial movies.
Perhaps the most unappreciated element in being a successful actor is picking good projects and Bell
clearly lacks it. Quick, get a new management team or call me, Jamie! Finally, Goon  is the story of a
bruiser who gets a break and joins a hockey team. It seems like typecasting for Seann William Scott but
the twist is that his character is actually a mild-mannered polite dude. But everything here was done withmuch more wit long ago with Slap Shot.
The Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut  ($29.98; Time Life) -- This three DVD set contains six
complete episodes stretching from 1966 through 1971 when the coolest member of the Rat Pack enjoyed</p>
<p>a Top 20 hit (peaking at #8 for two seasons) during an extended primetime run. It was one of a gazillion
variety shows on TV at the time, including stars like Red Skelton, Carol Burnett, Jimmy Dean, Steve
Lawrence, Glenn Campbell, Lawrence Welk, Jackie Gleason and, of course, Ed Sullivan, just to name a
few. Of all of them, Martin was surely the laziest, insisting on not showing up until the day of taping anddoing no virtually no rehearsals. It shows, though surely the ultra-casual atmosphere provides much ofthe appeal. It certainly wasn't the lame humor or skits or anonymous dancers. Guests ranged from thetalented (Zero Mostel, Buck Owens) to the pretty (Joey Heatherton was a staple) to the comic (BobNewhart). It's all pretty awful but fascinating in a time capsule sort of way. If you watched it at the time,the flood of memories for an entire era will be strong (boy is television better today!). Moments ofgenuine artistry survive, like Martin delivering a fairly intense "Talk Of The Town" and -- out of nowhere -- Orson Welles performing a subtle, fascinating monologue from The Merchant Of Venice.  His magic
tricks? Not so special.
Summer Interlude  ($29.95 Blu-ray; Criterion)
Summer with Monika  ($39.95 Blu-ray; Criterion) 
Smiles of a Summer Night  ($39.95 Blu-ray; Criterion) -- For anyone intimidated by the reputation of
director Ingmar Bergman, the "summer" movies are a great introduction. Start with Summer Interlude ,
the film Bergman himself saw as an artistic breakthrough. It was his tenth film and focuses on a balletdancer escaping from the drudgery of her demanding career by remembering the sweet innocence of herromance with a beautiful young student one summer. Follow that with Summer With Monika , the
serious drama about two young lovers who run away from home featuring a ravishing HarrietAndersson. The extras include coverage of the "naughtier" version edited into being by U.S. distributors,
along with other substantial bonus features. Finish with Criterion's Smiles Of A Summer's Night  (his</p>

We Were Here  ($29.95; Docurama)
The Pruitt-Igoe Myth  ($27.95; First Run Features)
Harry Belafonte -- Sing Your Song  ($29.95; Docurama)
Cold War: The Complete Series  ($68.92; Warner Bros.)
Carol Channing: Larger Than Life  ($24.95; EOne)
Into the Abyss  ($29.98 Blu-ray; MPI)
The War  ($129.99 Blu-ray; PBS?Paramount) -- We Were Here  is one of the most acclaimed
documentaries in years, though it happened so quietly almost no one noticed. Focusing on the AIDS
epidemic in San Francisco, I'm not sure what's more impressive -- making this tragedy seem new again
or doing so in a trim, satisfying 90 minutes. The Pruitt-Igoe Myth  convincingly makes you rethink your
attitude towards public housing but taking a new look at one of its most famous "failures," the public
housing complex built in 1956. Sing Your Song  is earnest, but since it's about singer and actor, and above
all, activist Harry Belafonte, that's perfectly appropriate. He's been carrying the banner for liberal causesso long Belafonte couldn't switch out of pioneering mode if he tried. It obscured and sidelined his serioustalents as a singer, unfortunately. Cold War  is probably the most ambitious documentary series ever
produced by a 24-hour news channel and it holds up well years later as a work of substance. CarolChanning enlivens any film or show she appears in and her own story is no exception, though this gentlevalentine Larger Than Life  is far from revelatory. Director Werner Herzog's devotion to documentaries
continues to pay dividends with Into The Abyss,  a look at a man on death row and the people whose lives
he fractured with his violent act. Ken Burns does his thing for WWII, though this 15 hour effort feels alittle rote because we're so familiar with his approach to such material. Still, it's good to have The War  on
BluRay and available to instruct those unfamiliar with the broad outlines of the last war everyone butardent pacifists could rally behind.
