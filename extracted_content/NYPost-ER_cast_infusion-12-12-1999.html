By MICHAEL GllTZ 
l1e fifth season of "ER" was 
the first weak one in the 
show's history. The departure 
of George Clooney was the 
big news. But that wouldn't have 
seemed so worrying if the people 
left behind weren't saddled with 
episodes more suited to a daytime 
soap. 
Noah Wyle's Carter ogling Lucy 
Knight's underwear and Anthony 
Edward's Mark Greene facing 
stalker Mare Winningham were 
just two ill-advised plot twists. 
Since this season meant the end 
of the road for Julianna Margulies 
and Gloria Reubens, "ER" seemed 
headed for a sad, slow decline. 
But like other truly great shows 
-"All in the Family," "M*A*S*H," 
"Law & Order" -"ER" has man­
aged to reinvent itself with a batch 
CHARACTER: Dr. Cle'o Finch 
AGE:S3 of new characters and returning 
favorites. 
"ER" has always been about the 
doctors more than the patients. So 
if we think we know how they're 
always going to behave, the show 
dies. 
These new characters change 
that. 
They're slowly being fleshed out, 
but just their addition to the ER 
makes every incoming case a bat­
tleground. Old favorites want to 
maintain their turf; newcomers 
want to show they've got what it 
takes. 
Unlike a soap, these additions to 
the cast aren't villains or heroes­
just new people with new ways of 
working. They add a little danger, 
a little sex appeal and a lot of 
chaos. 
Here are four scene-stealers who 
make "ER" worth watching again.

only three episodes in the first 
season of "ER," but the writers 
kept extending her storyline. 
She'd starred in "The Joy Luck 
Club" and offers were coming 
fast and furious, so Ming-Na 
jumped for something more per­
manent and ended up on "The 
Single Guy," a reviled NBC sit­
com. 
Finally escaping after two 
years, Ming-Na landed a lead 
role in Mike Figgis' follow-up to 
the Oscar-winning "Leaving Las 
Vegas." She gave a very good 
performance , but the movie -
"One Night Stand" -didn't 
last even that long in theaters, 
Now she's back on "ER," just in 
time to staunch the bleeding 
from lost'opportunities and 
wasted time, ", '</p>
