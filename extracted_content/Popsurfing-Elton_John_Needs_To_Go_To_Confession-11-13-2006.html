            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  N O V E M B E R  1 3 ,  2 0 0 6Elton John Needs To Go To ConfessionOkay, logic isn't his strong suit. Elton John thinks organized religion isa blight and needs to be banned worldwide because they foster suchhatred, especially towards gays. (That should be easy to do, right?) Buthe also wants the leaders of organized religion to have a major conclaveand push for world peace. So, they're evil, but before we eliminate themforever it would be nice if they could help us avoid World War III.Okaaaay. And here's Elton's memories of Sunday school:"I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautifulstories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collectedall the little stickers and put them in my book."Well, he gave it a go. He collected the stickers, so don't say Elton didn'tkeep an open mind. He's hardly alone. I have friends who insistorganized religion is responsible for countless wars, genocides andother crimes against humanity and that we'd be better off withoutthem. Balderdash. If every religion in the world disappeared today,people would quickly find a million other reasons to hate each other,from skin color to nationality to you name it. "South Park" just mockedthe idea that religion is the root of all evil with a truly hilarioustwo-part episode. 500 years in the future, the two main branches ofatheism are slaughtering each other over issues of belief and sayingthings like "Science damnit!" and "In the name of science, what are youdoing?" rather than using the word "God." Very funny. Very true.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
