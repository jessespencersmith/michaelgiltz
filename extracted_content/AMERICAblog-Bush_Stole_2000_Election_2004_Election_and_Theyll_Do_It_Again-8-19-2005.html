8/19/2005 09:34:00 AMPaul Krugman talks about the obvious: that Bush lost Floridaand lost the 2000 election, the Republicans suppressed theDemocratic vote in Ohio in 2004 and given the chance they'llsteal it again in 2006 and 2008. What's truly shocking is thatreal election reform isn't a priority FOR EITHER PARTY.Election supervisors at the local and state level must by law benon-partisan and unaffiliated with either party. Period. Everydistrict must have the same share of voting machines based onvoter population. Period. Every machine must produce a papertrail that the voter can confirm. Period. (Heck, I'm all forthrowing out all the machines and sticking to a paper ballot --cheap and easy to store. Who cares if we have to wait threedays to find out who the president is?) Those choosing themachines must not be able to later work for the companiesthey bought the machines from. Period.Why is no one from either party pushing for very reasonable,common sense reforms like these and numerous others thathave been bandied about in the press? Why don't voters care?
