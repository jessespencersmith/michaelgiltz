            <p>Wayne Scot Lukas and his beloved Patricio: "Horses have changed my life," he shares. 
• Stylist to the stars 
Wayne Scot Lukas 
falls in love with the 
equestrian lifestyle. 
OVIES AND BOOKS 
are filled with stories 
about dewy-eyed 
youngsters bonding 
with a pony and de­
veloping a life-long passion for riding. 
(They usually win the big race at the end 
of the film to boot.) 
Another story is heard far less often: 
The story of adults who perhaps thought 
the horsey life had passed them by. They 
stumble onto a barn or get a free riding 
lesson, though, and suddenly-long after 
most people have given up on learning 
anything new-they find riding. In fash­
ion maven Wayne Scot Lukas' case, per­
haps riding found him. 
"Maybe everybody wouldn't feel like 
this;' avers Lukas, "but it's changed my 
life. Horses have changed my life:' 
A stylist and fashion guru, the six­
foot-four Lukas is at the top of his field in 
the entertainment world, crafting looks 
for artists like Justin Timberlake, Tina 
Turner, Cindy Crawford, Lauren Hutton, 
Meryl Streep, Halle Berry, and especially 
Janet Jackson, with whom Lukas has 
worked for more than a decade. He also 
launched and co-hosted the TLC hit cable 
show What Not to Wear and has numer­
ous other projects in the works. 
A busy, busy man, perhaps the last 
thing Lukas wanted was a new endeavor 
that would push him to get up early or 
stay out late almost every day. That's ex­
actly what he got, though, after his father 
died and an old friend called Lukas to in­
vite him on a day trip to visit her horse. 
"I said, 'You have a horse?'" remem­
bers Lukas. She said, 'Yeah, his name is 
Willie: So we drove up to the barn and I 
walked into the barn, and Willie walked 
over to me and wrapped his head around 
my neck and pulled me into his chin and

SHOW CIRCUIT @ FAll 2005 he started to purr and whinny. I thought, 
'What the heck is this?' And then I walked 
away and she said, 'You need to ride.' 
"So then I went back and started 
brushing Willie's tail, and Willie turned 
around and started to lick my arm and 
watch me brush him. And she said, 'You 
need to ride: And then I was walking 
out to the field, and Willie hooked his 
head over my shoulder and walked 
along with me. And she said, 'Wayne, 
you need to ride.'" 
Lukas' friend followed up this exhor­
tation with a gift of Der-Dau boots and 
other riding equipment for Christmas. 
Another acquaintance sent Lukas out to 
the riding stable ofJonathan Soresi, a 
trainer who works with professional s 
and regular people but is also known for 
his celebrity clients. Lukas praises Sore­
si's gentle way of encouraging people's 
strengths rather than critiquing their 
faults. "He always teaches with compas­
sion and compliments;' Lukas describes. 
Soresi insists it is simply a pleasure to 
teach someone who takes to horsing so 
quickly. 
"Wayne has a great passion;' enthuses 
Soresi, the owner and head trainer of 
Soresi Show Stables (www.soresishow 
stables.com) in Morris County at the 
North Jersey Equestrian Center. "He's got 
a tremendous sense of curiosity, and he'll 
ask a lot of questions and is really inter­
ested in many aspects of it. Horses, horse 
care, the horse business-it's a whole new 
world for him. As a rider, he's rocketed 
right along. There's an example of some­
body for whom it was meant to be:' 
Like many converts, Lukas fell hard. 
He started riding six days a week, espe­
cially loving the early morning and late 
night sessions when everyone else was 
gone, and the barn was like a cathedral. 
"I didn't realize that being a rider 
meant being an athlete;' admits Lukas, 
who keeps an apartment in the Chelsea 
neigh borhood of New York, but spends 
most of his time at Spring Lake on the 
Jersey Shore. "I lost 40 pounds in three 
months. The weight just poured off me." 
His client and friend Janet Jackson 
raved about how skinny Lukas was, not to 
mention his riding chaps. That led Lukas</p>
<p>to buy her half-chaps that he customized 
into boots with four inch heels. He creat­
ed an equestrian look that swept into 
fashion magazines just as the love of 
horses became "hip" thanks to Jackson, 
Madonna, Angelina Jolie, and others. He 
hopes to inspire some changes in style at 
competitions as well. 
"I just designed these amazing men's 
riding coats;' explains Lukas, who uses a 
revolutionary fabric with inserted silver 
thread called Microsilver to craft them 
and gave one to Soresi as a gift. ,"They're 
just beyond. They breathe, they thermal­
regulate, and because they are antibacter­
ial, they don't hold odor, and I put in 
these amazing shoulder pads inspired by 
Kelly Klein's riding coats. I'm talking to 
someone about making waterproof rid­
ing coats for kids. Kids spend time on the 
horses, and they get soaking wet in a 
thunderstorm the first class and have to 
ride three more events. So we're talking 
about making waterproof, seasonless 
wool Microsilver coats. 
"It could be fun. The only way to 
change the horse business clothing-wise 
is to go a little to the left. You can't disre­
spect the tradition. I'm just trying to 
change the fabrication so people can see 
there's a better way. Your wool riding 
jacket can breathe! Your wool riding jack­
et can stretch! Kids don't have to look like 
they're 50 year old women in ill-fitting 
riding clothes anymore. Come on. My 
job is not to bulldoze; my job is to respect 
the tradition of the horse business, but 
you move [it] forward." 
If he succeeds, it will be just the latest 
coup for Lukas, who went from a paper 
route as a little boy to cutting hair on his 
mom's porch and then rocketed to inter­
national success. Along with a film and 
TV production company, Lukas has his 
own website (www.waynescotlukas. 
com), a Web page on Amazon.com 
(called a "Wayne's Favorite Things Bou­
tique") devoted to what he loves best, a 
fashion book in the works, a lucrative 
arrangement with Spiegel catalog (whom 
Lukas states simply he helped rescue 
from bankruptcy), and QVC plans to 
begin selling his lines of equestrian­
themed clothing, Ez-Pieces and S'wrap, Patricio is an IS-hand dark bay 13-year-old Holsteiner.

which was co-designed with Marcella 
Leone, wife of Olympic silver medalist 
rider-trainer Peter Leone, on its channel 
in November. 
Lukas has also become very involved 
in the riding world, attending competi­
tions, encouraging his friend Deborah 
Cox (the star of Broadway's Aida) to 
perform at charity events held in the 
equestrian world, and even purchasing 
jumps created by the famous German 
SHOW CIRCUIT @ FALL 2005 designer Olaf Peterson. (Lukas and Sore­
si plan to donate this jump to a charity 
benefit in Wellington in the fall with the 
proceeds going to the Equestrian AIDS 
Foundation.) 
''I'm getting ready to explode to an­
other level of being Wayne Scot Lukas;' 
he asserts, saying that eight years of thera­
py have helped him keep the attention 
and intensity in perspective. "I've learned 
what you do with fame. You go on TV to 
get more endorsements to sell more 
things and get better products. You don't 
go on TV to get famous. TV is a too1:' 
However frantic and successful his life 
continues to be, Lukas knows his passion 
for horses will remain integral. 
"I got so hooked I was mucking stalls 
and cleaning up manure and trying to 
learn how to clean horses. I was 14 again;' 
he relates. 
Though Lukas had planned to lease a 
horse, he fell in love with a 13-year-old 
Holsteiner dark bay mount named Patri­
cio, found in Florida by horse broker and 
friend Michael D'Ambrosio. Lukas and 
Soresi flew down immediately to try the 
horse. Despite passing numerous med­
ical exams with exceptionally good re­
sults, the day Lukas was writing the final 
check, Patricio fell deathly ill and wors­
ened day by day. No one could determine 
the problem and-while speaking to the 
best veterinarians available-Lukas 
reached out to a psychic and even a horse 
healer in Arizona named Kedzi Morgan 
(who does readings by phone) to help 
solve this mystery. 
Cynics advised Lukas that a horse was 
Lukas, Soresi, and famed course 
designer Anthony D'Ambrosio 0.) with their 
Olaf Peterson Grand Prix Olympic jump</p>
<p>not a pet and that he should not bother 
spending so much money on a horse he 
had barely ridden. "But I can't think of an 
animal or a person as disposable;' reveals 
Lukas, who stuck by the horse that made 
him feel so safe as a rider that "it was like 
jumping a fence on your favorite sofa." 
Today, Patricio is healthy, and Lukas feels 
they were destined for each other. "We are 
the 2005 version of Sea Biscuit. I was 
thrown 10 weeks ago and couldn't ride, 
and Patricio was down with an illness. 
But I'm back on;' reports Lukas. "Togeth­
er Patricio and I are training and parallel­
ing each other on our way back up to 
being fit. It is an amazing journey:' 
Lukas took the horse healer's advice 
and groomed and grazed the horse at his 
vet, Brendan Furlong and Associates, 
every day for 28 days, hoping he would 
get better. The vets told Lukas that a lot of 
horse owners never come in when a horse 
is down, he recounts. "They said 'It is such 
a pleasure to have you here grazing and 
grooming him into wellness.'" 
"If I let my heart make the decision 
instead of my head, I have the horse that 
God and the world knew I had to have at 
this point in my life right now;' affirms 
Lukas. "This horse came to teach. He 
taught us a lot of lessons about love and 
about hope and about faith. He's an ex­
tremely beautiful horse, and you'd never 
think anything had happened to him. 
Every day he thrives:' 
With business pulling Lukas in a mil­
lion different directions, nothing focuses 
his mind like being on a 1,500 pound 
steed. 
"If you don't want to get thrown off a 
horse, you've got to be present. And isn't 
that a metaphor for the rest of our lives? 
You don't want to get thrown out of a 
job? You've got to be present. You don't 
want to be thrown out of a relationship 
-you've got to be present. The thrill is to 
completely let go and trust;' Lukas de­
clares. "The thrill is to trust yourself and 
your connection to the horse:' 
"People spend their whole life search­
ing for ultimate joy and fulfillment;' af­
firms Janet Jackson, his client of more 
than 10 years. "My dear friend Lukas has 
found it, in horses and riding:' • However frantic and successful his life continues to be, 
Lukas knows his passion for horses will remain integral.
