4/25/2005 11:52:00 AMA fun LA Times story reports that Republican Congressmen areshocked, shocked when they are invited to the White House tomeet with Bush (he used to only bother speaking with topleaders) and even more surprised when Bush actually invitestheir comments and concerns on Social Security.Of course, the real fun begins when it details the many times inthe past Bush has behaved like a jerk.In a 2001 budget meeting still fresh in congressionalmemories, Bush antagonized a bipartisan group of seniormembers who were seeking additional funding for domesticsecurity. Bush bluntly threatened a veto and, rather thanrespond to lawmakers' arguments, abruptly left themeeting."I was flabbergasted and amazed," said Rep. David R. Obey(D-Wis.). "We expected it was going to be a workingmeeting instead of a 'my way or the highway' meeting."Republicans again saw an adamant, table-pounding Bushwhen he tried to persuade lawmakers in 2003 to supportfull funding for rebuilding Iraq. "I'm not here to debateyou," Bush said at one meeting, interrupting one senator.As for Social Security, some pleaded with Bush to, you know, actuallylay out a plan of some sort, but he's STILL not ready for that. Mightstifle debate, blah blah blah. And of course if he actually detailed hisplan to gut Social Security, he'd have to admit he wants to cutbenefits by 40% and old people have to pray they'd make up theshortfall. (Hey, maybe it's just an elaborate plot to increase prayer?)
