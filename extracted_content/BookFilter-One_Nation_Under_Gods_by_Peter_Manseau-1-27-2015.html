MoreOne Nation, Under Godsby Peter ManseauPrice: $28.00(Hardcover)Published: January 27, 2015Rating: 0.0/5 (0 votes cast)From the Publisher: A groundbreaking new look at the storyof AmericaAt the heart of the nation's spiritual history are audacious and oftenviolent scenes. But the Puritans and the shining city on the hill giveus just one way to understand the United States. Rather thanrecite American history from a Christian vantage point, PeterManseau proves that what really happened is worth a close, freshlook. Thomas Jefferson himself collected books on all religions andrequired that the brand new Library of Congress take his books,since Americans needed to consider the "twenty gods or no god"he famously noted were revered by his neighbors. Looking at theAmericans who believed in these gods, Manseau fills in America'sstory of itself, from the persecuted "witches" at Salem and whothey really were, to the persecuted Buddhists in WWII California,from spirituality…Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This BookGo to your preferred retailer, click to choose a format and you' ll be taken directly to their site whereyou can get this book.BookFilter</p>

Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayCall it "The People's Religious History Of The United States" and you'll capture the vividness and potential impact ofthis work by author Peter Manseau. He vividly captures the religious diversity that has defined the United States longbefore it even was the United States. This book journeys in time from a Muslim slave brought to the continent by theSpanish who ended up a god of sorts (trust me, it's not a happy ending for him) all the way to Barack Obama'sinaugural address in which the President formally acknowledged the many faiths that make up our country. Inbetween Manseau has you rethink everything from the Salem witch trials (not so crazy, actually ) to the GreatAwakening to that hippie happening where they hoped to levitate the Pentagon. Manseau shows slave owners whoinitially were vehemently opposed to converting their "property" into Christians become slave owners eager to do so.(The reason for both stances? Money.) From the role of women in seeding new ideas to the role of Jews in theAmerican revolution to the role of Buddhists in WW II (their refusal to assimilate in terms of language and faith madethem hugely helpful to the Allied cause), Manseau's book repeatedly casts our common history into a new light. Hissynthesis of well-established facts with original reporting make this Book One for any who want to be enlightened onthe true picture of religion in America. -- Michael Giltz LessWhat Others SayPraise for ONE NATION, UNDER GODS"Subversive and much-needed...[a] tour de force. A thorough reimagining of our nation's religions.... Engaginglywritten, with a historian's eye for detail and a novelist's sense of character and timing, this history from anotherperspective reexamines familiar tales and introduces fascinating counternarratives."âPublishers Weekly (starredreview) - "The United States is arguably the most religiously diverse nation in the world. Peter Manseau shows how this hasalways been the case. One Nation, Under Gods is a refreshing, compelling, and surprising reexamination of ournation's history that puts lie to the oft-quoted idea that America was founded as 'a Christian nation.'"âReza Aslan,author of No god but God and Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth - "Accessible and insightful prose... A richer, more complex, and compelling viewpoint that is reminiscent of HowardZinn's People's History of the United States... This significant and timely work is important for those who wish tounderstand the complete and…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
