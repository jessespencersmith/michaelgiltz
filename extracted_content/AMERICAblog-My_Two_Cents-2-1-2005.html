2/14/2005 09:07:00 PMI'm just sitting back and enjoying the work of John "Scoop"Aravosis. This is why I donate my time and you should donateyour money to his work.Steny Hoyer and the conservative blogger above both makevalid points. This is not about digging into someone's privatelife -- this is about national security, this is about plantingdecoys into the White House press room, this is aboutmanipulating the media to deceive the American people and alot more. You should be blasting the mainstream media withthe very serious talking points John raises below (not tomention the comments of Hoyer).Who specifically approved of GannonGuckert's access to theWhite House press room. When? What are the standardbackground checks done on reporters applying for this access?Who did this check on GannonGuckert if any such check weredone? How could a vanity website with no journalisticbackground pass even the most basic background check?GannonGuckert couldn't get credentialed for a city councilmeeting and certainly not on Capitol Hill. Who signed off onhim? This COULD NOT be done via routine channels or hewould have been turned down.And one more teeny tiny point for those who want to pretendwe're invading GannonGuckert's privacy and digging into hispersonal life just to embarrass him:HE POSTED THESE PHOTOS ON THE WEB FOR ALL THE WORLDTO SEE.GannonGuckert was not stalked by photographers. No one dugthrough his trash. Hidden cameras were not placed in sleazyhotel rooms to gain evidence. GannonGuckert posed for thecameras and then put them on the biggest display board in theworld to drum up business. GannonGuckert wanted people tosee them; he wanted strangers to see them. He wanted tomake money off of them. Any of his family or friends orbusiness associates could have stumbled upon them at anytime. If anyone disturbed GannonGuckert's privacy, it wasGannonGuckert himself.
