            <p>AWAKENING'TO
his band to Joe's Pub "" MT.HAEL GrLrz
"Spring Awakening." He met
one of his best friends by spon-
taneously performing a duet of
a Broadway show tune at a high
school house parly. And his rock
band, Old Springs Pike, devel-
oped an early fan base by head-
ing to Unitarian churches and
performing raucous folk music
at Sunday services.
But it's still going to take the 23-year-
old actor a little while getting used to
havingjust rocked the Tony Awards and
winning a Best Featured Actor award for
his shock-headed performance as Mori-
tz, the doomed student in the critically
acclaimed hit musical
"The eight minutes after you win are
some of the most ecstatic, unbelievable
emotional moments I have ever experi-
enced," says Gallagher, who jokes about
taking his picture backstage with fellow
wrnner Billy Crudup while trying not to
cry He was most relieved about not em-
barrassing himself
"l knew there was anotherJohn in my
category-John Cullum - so I prepared
myself: 'Ifyou hen "John," don't go cra-
zy, don't get up immediately, just wait
for it and make sure you hear the
last name "'
He heard the last name
he was hoping for, and
now Gallagher - who has
an upcoming role in the
Kenneth Lonergan movie
"Margaret" - finds him-
self a sought-after actot
even though he walked out
of a "Spring Awakening" au-
dition because he was more com-
mitted to his rock band and didn't feel
he belonged there
Naturally, his success on Broadway
will bring a lot more attention to Old
Springs Pike, which perfoms at Joe's
Pub tomorow night and at the Zipper
Theater on W 37th St. in August
Gallagher's parents are folk musi-
cians, and he's a self-confessed "hamo-
ny slut," so it's no surprise Old Springs
Pike is a rootsy affair whose trademark
covers include Tom Petty and Bob Dylan.
But they're not too cool to admit the band
name came from the street one of them
lived on, a name that had to be tweaked
because it was too simila to BillyJoel's
l97l debut album, "Cold Spring Harbor"Gallagher had watched his fellow bmd
members perfoming in their om bmd
in high school, tfuilled to heu other peo-
ple embracing the sounds of Crosby, Stills
md Nash and The Band Butthey were
much older - 16, instead of I 5 - and it
was a while before they all comected
John bonded with Jmes Cleare by be-
ing tutored in the importance of Billy Joel
He md Heather Robb sprked after doing
a duet of the Beatles classic "If I Fell "
And James Smith was the guy Gal-
lagher impressed by starting up
that impromptu duet at a party.
(Ihe song was from "The Se-
I cret Gaden," a musical Smith
I was perfoming for school.)
Then theywent their sep-
arate ways - as high school
kids will - util the four mem-
bers found themselves all livine
in New York at the same time.
"Of couse, the guitars came out and
the nights of drinking md singing begm,"
says Gallagher "And three weeks later,
we had three songs we were all really ex-
cited about,"
Now Gailagher has a Tony; the bmd's
steadily increasing fan base has a lot of
new members, md Old Springs Pike
has some new songs to perform Galla-
gher is committed to "Spring Awaken-
ing" though Novembe4 and the future -
"Spring Awakening" in Inndon? An OId
Springs Pike CD? - is wide open.
But one step at a time for Gallagher,
who is still new enough to recognLe with
awe, "Joe's Pub will be the biggest place
we've played in NewYork!" a</p>
