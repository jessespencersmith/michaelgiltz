 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdNYMF 2012 Roundup #5: The
Lindbergh Baby Kidnapping and theLure of Eternal Youth
This is the fifth in a series of roundups covering shows appearing in the New York Musical Theatre
Festival , or NYMF . Every year I attend as many shows as I can and invariably see one or two that will
rank among the best of the year, as well as discovering some new talented performers and behind the
scenes artists I'll want to keep an eye on in future productions. Go to the NYMF  website for more info
on inexpensive tickets.
BABY CASE  ** 1/2 out of ****
FOREVERMAN  * 1/2 out of ****
BABY CASE  ** 1/2 out of ****
SIGNATURE THEATREThis is perhaps the most ambitious and potentially most exciting show I've seen at NYMF this year. It's
clearly in the vein of Kander and Ebb, a cynical, smart, unexpected tale that bites off quite a bit -- mediafrenzy, prejudice, celebrity and much more. It will be fascinating to see if this show develops further.
Creator Michael Ogborn  has been working on it for a decade and the passion and care shows.
It centers on the kidnapping of the baby of Anne and Charles Lindbergh, one of the most famous couplesin the world because of his trans-atlantic flight. The baby was ultimately found dead (hello, Kander and
Ebb, building a musical around the death of a baby!) and an immigrant carpenter Bruno Hauptmann wasfound guilty and executed in what was dubbed "the trial of the century" back in the 1930s.
The musical Chicago  looms large over this effort, with their similar takes on the frenzy surrounding
crimes that capture the public imagination. Act One focuses on the crime and Act Two on the trial, with
caustic takes on the media sprinkled throughout, whether it's the reporters and photographers that won't
even leave the Lindbergh couple alone on their honeymoon or the even more vulture-ish people who
snap photos of the baby's corpse and others who pretend to hawk locks of the baby's hair for profit.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>In a smart bit of double casting, Will Reynolds plays both Charles Lindbergh and Bruno Hauptmann,
while Anika Larsen plays both Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Anna Hauptmann. Interestingly, Reynoldshas more success with the passionately defensive Hauptmann than the tight-lipped Lindbergh while
Larsen enjoys her best moments as the stolid Mrs. Lindbergh rather than the wife who spends her life
protesting her husband's innocence.
Michael Thomas Holmes has great fun as the ringmaster Walter Winchell, setting up the story and
informing us of developments (and the general public opinion) in the rat-a-tat manner of a newsman.
For me, the emotional high point was Hannah Elless as reporter Adela St. Johns describing AnneLindbergh on the day of her testimony in "Hour Of Gold" (a song named after Lindberg's memoir). Theirduet has the wrenching emotional power you want and expect, anchoring a story that often has razzle
dazzle but not always the undercurrent of genuine heart that such a story needs to make us care.
Indeed, the many songs of cynicism begin to blend a bit, with one piece after another mocking the media
frenzy that erupted around the case. Other times, the much-needed heart is attempted but not reached,
such as Melissa van der Schyff's passionate delivery of "Dirty Dishes," a song by a servant badgered by
the police and the media which stretches a modest image to the breaking point.
The set and costume design by Martin Lopez is top-notch, with stacks of newspapers cleverly used in
numerous ways throughout, always reminding us that however painful the story, at least it sells papers.Ditto the lighting by Zach Blane and the graphic design by Ben Spriggs. Above all, the choreography byWarren Adams and the sterling direction by Jeremy Dobrich take a large cast and a complicated tale anddeliver it with pizazz.
The performance I saw was unfortunately plagued with audio problems throughout. And now that I know
it's been in development for a decade, I'm not certain they're ready to somehow tighten and focus the
story even more, uncovering the beating heart that lies at its center without losing the caustic take on the
media that drives it along.
Certainly, the umpteenth scene of corruption in "Lawsuit Daddy" felt like overkill, as fun as it was for the
actors to perform. And the title is a bother throughout. I've no idea what rights are at issue, but surely a
better title than Baby Case  could be found. It also proves a weak chorus in the title song. Many other
songs, however, are strong, and the sense that something needs to be focused more tightly is a common
complaint of Kander and Ebb shows... the first time around. And like most Kander and Ebb shows, I'd
love the chance to see Baby Case  -- whatever it's called -- again. It's an intelligent, sometimes truly
exciting piece of theater. If it falls short in some ways, that's because it attempts so very much.
FOREVERMAN  * 1/2 out of ****
THE PEARL ON 42 ST.
Fans of Frank Wildhorn should rush to catch Foreverman , a new musical very much in the vein of Jekyll
and Hyde  and the like. Brett M. Boles wrote the book, music and lyrics and while his tale is rooted in the
romantic potboilers of Robert Louis Stevenson and the like, at least he came up with an original story:
two young men, one wealthy and one poor, become fast friends, discover an elixir that can offer eternal
youth and then bitterly part ways over the love of a woman. Their struggles to achieve happiness and truelove will take hundreds of years to reach its climax.
Foreverman  is handsomely mounted with a serviceable scenic design by John McDermott, so-so
projections by Mark Costello and excellent costumes by Anne Liberman and Barry Doss. Those clothes do
the heavy lifting when it comes to setting the period and the high adventure mood of a costumer. The
cast is strong-voiced and does their best while director Stephen Nachamie ably keeps this ambitious work
focused and moving along.
Unfortunately, Boles is akin to Wildhorn in spirit and deed. His book takes forever to get going and
continually must stop and explain itself. Plot twists are downright silly -- a kiss immediately reawakensone character's suppressed memories of a past life? Sure, you'd go with it in some context but not here.The cuts back and forth between centuries in the first act feel random and unnecessary. And most
damning of all, the songs are filled with tepid lyrics that all the passion in the world can't ignite.
"You're a sun and I'm a shooting star" is perhaps a fine distinction between a woman cursed to die young
and a man who will live forever. But the shooting star image is repeated again and again, 'til you're sick ofit. Pedestrian rhymes abound. "She's a mystery and a danger/ Now she's here to stay" or "Fiona/ The
world bursts into blossom at the sound of her name" or "I know this isn't what we planned/The way we
thought our lives would go/ What stranger's footprints in the sand/ Have caused an elemental chainreaction" or "It's madly taunting and strangely haunting" and so on. Like the book, the lyrics spend agreat deal of time simply spelling out what is going on. By the fourth or fifth explanation that they've
discovered an elixir that grants eternal life etc. etc. your attention begins to flag.
Further, the suspense and drama of those hundreds of years is rather mild. [SPOILER} Our two heros
simply avoid each other for that entire time, meet up again unexpectedly and then rather confusingly
make amends in a finale that left me a tad confused as to exactly what noble adventure they're embarkingon together. [END SPOILER}

and Glory Crampton are the love interests, pretty and passionate when called for. In the small role ofLord Fairwright, Nat Chandler has weight and actually makes a scene of betrayal carry the night's lone
source of emotion. Larry Cahn and Karen Elliott as two servants enjoy the brief bit of humor in the piece
when they embark on a romance. Adam Monley is the voice of reason as the poor but resolute JackMercer. And as Will Timeson (get it?), Omar Lopez-Cepero cuts a dashing romantic figure and has thevoice for this sort of popera endeavor. It's a pity he and the rest of the cast don't have songs and story
more worthy of their talent.
