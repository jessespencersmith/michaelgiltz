"All my fans saw me as some little
kid who can't even afford new jeans in
his room, so they'll support me," says
Burnham. "That'll work until I become
a success."
He already is: Burnham made his
NYC debut at Carolines Comedv Club last
week, has already been to London to appear
on T! has performed at the prestigious Montreal
Just for Laughs festival and has late-night talk-show
bookers vying to be the first to put him on American
TV
Offering a gangly cross between the verbal
wordplay of George Carlin, the drollness of Steve
Martin and a self-deprecation all his own, the Ham-
ilton, Mass., native's explosive success began when
he sat in his bedroom and videotaped a perfor-million views. That's usually the begin-
rting and the end of most online viral
Bhenomena., But hd soon posted three more
vrdeos, all with jokey themes like Helen
Kbller being the perfect woman or a
"Harold and Maude"-like ode to dating
a senior citizen. Thev too became smash
online hits, in no small part thanks to Burn-
ham's wittybanter. ("Hello world ... and Internet
pedophiles," hF winks at the beginning of one tune.)
Now he has had 15 million views of his baker's
dozenworth of videos featuring hilarious tunes like
"New Math" and "I'm Bo Yo," songs packed with so
many vulgar puns and clever oneliners you have to
listen to them repeatedly to catch all the jokes.
