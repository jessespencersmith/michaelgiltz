<p>COVER STORY
'm not going to keep my mouth
c losed a nym o re," says T. R.
Knight. After more than a week
of conversations-in person, by
phone, by e-mail-that's the
defining statement from the
actor whos at the center of the
storm of controversy that for the last nine
months has engulfed ABCIs Grels Anatomy.
From Knight, thats a lot. Speaking out doesnt
come easily for him. Raised in Minnesota, he is
naturally reserved and averse to talking about
himself "Don't get too big for your britches," he
was warned as a boy, and hes always taken that
to heart. Why would anyone care about him,
much less what he thinks?
But if you saw Knight on TV at this year's
GLAAD Media Awards in Los Angeles, you can't
shake the memory of the warm applause that be-
carne a standing ovation, his abashed demeanor
in the spotlight, and his simple moment of truth.
"I'm angry," he said-and paused, caught up in
emotion. "I'm very angry at the inequality we face
every day."
That anger, it seems, is one reason the press-
shy Knight decided to sit down vnLhThe Aduocate
to give his first in-depth interview since coming
out October 19 in a statement released to People
magaz]ne.
My first meeting with T.R. is over sushi at a
Los Angeles restaurant of his choosing. He's late
but scores points for politeness when he calls to
apologize. He eventually arrives, literally rurrning
around the corner. He's coming from a workout
session, something he began in eamest this year.
His hair is mussed, and he looks nrmpled and dis-
arming. His fame isn't the stalkerazzi kind: Al-
though people sometimes glance at him from
other tables, no one intermpts us.
Knight is clearly not accustomed to being inter-
viewed. He is a charmingly awkward talker who
pauses and frets over his words, stumbling over
his sentences and backtracking repeatedly before
apologizing for his verbal clumsiness. An innocu-
ous question about what his parents do for a liv-
ing results in a five-minute explanation of why he
doesn't want to discuss that.
At first, his answers are vague and nonspecific
(perhaps an unintended result of spending a good
chunk of his life in the closet professionally). At
times trying to get any specffic, personal inforrna-tion out of him feels like dealing with a skittish
horse: Move too quickly and he might bolt. And
soon he does-he excuses himself to go walk his
dog, assuring me that he knows we aren't done
talking yet. I hope he means it.
or a self-effacing guy, Knight has a job that's
about as public as they come--he stars as
Dr. George O'Malley in ABC's hit drama
Grey's Anatomy, a show that's often the number
1-rated television drama and is set to spin offan-
other series in the fall From the outset, Grey'.s has
won points as progressive television, notjust for its
color-blind casting but also for its atbitudes toward
women and other minorities. Like gays.
Knight wasn't at the GLAAD Awards in April
just to collect applause He was representing
Greyt, nominated for Outstanding Individual
Episode for 'Where the Boys Are " (The episode
won.) Ironically, it was during the filming of that
episode-which touched on both gay and trans-
gender issues-that cast member Isaiah Wash-
ington got into an argument with actor Patrick
Dempsey and referred to an unnamed fellow
actor as a "faggot " The blogosphere immediately
began to speculate about whom Washington
meant, but before rumors could spread in
earnest, Knight ended the guessing game with
this statement to People: "I guess there have
been a few questions about my sexuality, and I'd
like to quiet any unnecessary rrmors that may
be out there. While I prefer to keep my personal
life private, I hope the fact that I'm gay isn't the
most interesting part of me." Thus began
Knight's rol ler-coaster ride.
Knight readily admits he'd had no intention of
coming out professionally. People counseled him
to keep quiet, and if he had, the 34-year-old be-
lieves, the questions would have died down as
quickly as they arose. Still, he's clear that he
doesn't feel he was outed. "I made the decision to
make a statement," he says. "I could have not
lspoken up]. I could have retreated. But I'm defi-
nitely happy I made the decision "
Though his friends were "beautifully sup-
portive," other people told him, "Don't do it-
don't do it now." To his own surprise, he kept
moving forward.
"I remember saying to someone when I got one
of those 'don't do it' Lcommentsl-I just remember
hearing my voice being very calm and saying, No,
ilis going to happen. It's going to happen. I'm just
letting vou know."'
Knight was so unused to dealing with the
press he wasn't even sure how to proceed He
called his publicist and said he wanted to come
out, asking, 'What do you do? Is there a phone
call you make?"
After our initial meeting, Knight and I sit
down for a second go at it, this time at the )As Dr. George O'Malley,
Knight has become
a heartthrob to both
men ano women.

I"l wasHollywood Forever Cemetery on Santa Monica
Boulevard. If,s not a haunt of his: He chose it be-
cause it would be easy for me to get to from my
hotel room- -once more proving what a gentleman
he is. It's a lovely afternoon, the grounds are
quiet, and we find a bench near the tombstone of
a great-grandmother named Berta.
Walking the grounds, Knight is dressed casual-
iy again, this time in warm-up pants and a T-shirt
For a Minnesota boy, he's eager to talk-without
making his job more difficult or blurting out too
much personal information. At one point he stops
to straighten a bunch oftipped-over flowers on a
grave srte.
"This is something thaf,s bigger than [my ca-
reerl," says Krright, trying to describe his feelings
about coming out. "How selfish it would be to only
think of myself and my life as an actor when you
are weighing it against the severe homophobia
that [coming outl addresses."
He's quick to add the humbling qualifiers. He
doesn't deserve any special credit; this is not a
sacrifice. But he does hope his action encourages
others to follow suit. And there are people he'd
like to help
"I guess, specifrcally, it's younger gay peo-
ple," he says. "I wish I'd had more people to
look at-and I'm not talking about any sort of
role models-just more people to look at, rnorestories, more honesty, less hate."
He realizes there's no telling how it might af-
fect his career. But after ali, there have been re-
wards. For one, Rosie O'Donnell sent him a toast-
er. "It makes great toast," he laughs.
heodore Ra5nnond Knight is loath to talk
about his family and friends. His reluc-
tance is wrapped up in his struggle with
being gay-or more specifrcally, struggles with
how society treats people who are gay.
Some gay actors cite "privacy'' as a convenient
excuse not to come out professionally, even
though they love to suck up the spotlight in all
other aspects of their lives. Knight isn't like that.
"The reason I act is-" he pauses, starts again.
'You can disappear and not be yourself. You can
get out of it for a while. You get away from you.
That's what I liked about acting."
Maybe one thing Knight wants to get away
from is the pain he felt growing up gay. At age 5
he was acting at Minneapolis's famed Guthrie
Theater. flis first role was Tiny Tim in A Christ-
mas Carol (Adorable, right?) While he realizes
that any theater kid will get teased at school, the
taunts he received were more severe.
In particular, T R remembers this: When he
was in junior high, someone donated a wooden
play set for the kids to use. Shortly aft,er it arrived
another student spray-painted it all over with
slurs including T.R KMGnr IS A HoMosEXlJAr.
"Someone came up to me and said that there
was something written about me, and I went out
and looked at it," says Knight. "I didn't...I don't
think I even reaily knew what it was about, but I
knew it was not good. I knew it was wrong. I tried
to scrrb it off first, and it wasn't coming off, be-
cause it obviously was black paint on wood, and
then I went asking [the janitorsl, and they took
care ofit."
To Krright, the most upsetting part wasn't the
juvenile name-calling but that the people who
were running the Catholic school did nothing. He
wasjust expected to keep quiet.
He took refuge in his acting ambitions. He got
serious about the crafb in high school. At 25 he
moved to New York City to try to make it as an
actor. The first thing he learned was how to sur-
vive on $20 a week. "I'd buy a bunch ofbroccoli, a
can of Campbell's cream of mushroom soup, a box
ofnoodles, and one or two cans oftuna, and you
mix that all together, and that would last me
three days, and that's what I'd eat. And you'd
space it so i1/d be like two meals a day."
Working in theater, Knight naturally was being
asked out on dates by men. Friends asked ifhe
was gay, and in time he was ready to come out in
his private life. He lost some friends over that and
walked away from others who said they had prob-
lems with his sexuality for religious reasons )raised

<p>"l wish I

More

price for coming out professionally. Though he's
leery of mentioning other people in his life, even
those with whom he's not friendly any'rnore, it's
reasonable to assume that any friends who are
closeted would ilet about having been seen with
Knight in public. Since he came out, even banal
photos of him shopping at the mall with lliends
get posted on the Web.
All the drama is jttst so not him. His best f?iend
on the set of Grey's is Katherine Heigl, who plays
Dr.Izzie Stevens. Her description of how he came
out to her sums up Knight perfectly. "He actually
didn't just flat-out tell me," says Heigl. "There
came a point where we were close enough Iliends
that he would just talk about dates or about
other guys. It was revealed injust a really natur-
al way-a 'this is the way it is' way. I wasn't
shocked or surprised, like, 'Oh, my God-you're
really gay?' It was more just like, 'Oh, OK. Now I
know why you don't want to go out with me."'
Knight insists that his gay life isn't exactly
headline material anyway. "Not that I've had the
most successfirl dating experiences," he laughs. "I
won't say lfears of being outedl didn't register
with me at all, but it wasn't enough to keep me
from going out. I have to live my life. It wasn't
going to be some sort of, you know, cloak-and-dag-
ger thing." He says he's currently single but woritcomment on whether he was dating anyone when
he decided to come out last October.
Now that Knighf,s out to the world, the rules
have changed. "It probably wouldn't be a good
idea to date a closeted celebrity," he jokes. On the
plus side, now that everyone knows he's gay, the
reticent Knight could find himself fielding a lot
more potential boyfriends. Asked to talk about
whether he's noticed any changes, T.R. laughs
and says he stili assumes people aren't interested
in him Then comes his qualifier: "Too much ag-
gression isn't a good thing either."
espite some solid credits and the occa-
sional commercial that kept him afloat
frnancially, the 1990s were a struggle
professionally. Then he hit rock bottom. Knight
was frred from an off-Broadway show and lost
his agent a few months later. If he'd looked like
Brad Pitt, he was told, agents might have been
able to sell him better. As for the show. a
Restoration comedy, Knight was professional
butjust didn't click in the role for director Doug
Hughes. Typically, Knight agonizes over men-
tioning Hughes (the director of Doubt and the
current hit revival Inherit the Wind), although
he's a great admirer of the director and doesn't
harbor any ill feelings.
When he got an offer to star inAmadeus at the
Guthrie back in Minneapolis, Knight decided he'd
come flrll circle. He wouid do that final role and
then move on from acting.
But he was urged repeatedly by supporbers at
the Roundabout Theatre Company to come back
to New York and audition for a Broadway revival
of the British farce Noises Off. Knight could barely
afford the ticket, but he made the trip and won the
role of frazzled stage manager Tim Allgood. Sud-
denly, he was being taken seriously. More roles
quickly followed, capped by the soon-canceled sit-
com Charli.e Lawrence starring Nathan Lane. In
2005 came the big break, Grey's Anatomy.
Knight insists he doesn't see himself as hitting
the lottery vuit}r Grey's, mostly because he's condi-
tioned to expect the worst. Eventually the show
will come to an end, who knows if he'll build a
long-term career afber this success, and so on. For
now, he is on a hit show that has won critical ac-
claim. It s an actor's dream. At least it was.
With its utopian outlook on matters including
race, it s ironic that Grey's Anatomlt ended up at
the center ofa nasty controversy based on bigotry.
At frrst it seemed to media observers that the
show's creator, Shonda Rhimes, was more con-
cerned about putting the episode behind her than
dealing forthrightly with what happened and tak-
ing the proper steps. She said it was a briefinci
dent and that everyone had moved on. When it
was later suggested that another black actor
might replace Washington, she took offense. )

the pot again, lying to reporters at the Golden
Globe awards by denying what he had said.
Ifuight then went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show
(Ellen and T R. share the same PR frrm) and
made it clear that Washington had indeed called
him a faggot, a word he described ironically to
EIIen as "awesome." Washington then issued an-
other statement of apology, entered rehab or
counseling, and is now reportedly planning a pub-
lic service announcement for GI,AAD
But what about Knight? When asked if Wash-
ington had apologized to him personally, Knight
initially responded, "Which time?" Then, when
pressed, he said, 'What a lovely blue sky.,'When
queried about whether Rhimes had come to him
and asked what he wanted to happen, he paused
thoughtfirlly before saying, "I like blueberries. Do
you like blueberries?"
Washington's publicist declined an inter-view
request.
Rhimes also declined an interview. She did
send The Aduocaife this statement: "T.R. is an in-
credible actor and an amazing person. From his
ability to play comedic moments to his work in
the episode where George's father dies, his range
is a writer's dream. We are equally proud of his
decision to come out. He is an inspiration."
That still doesn't tell us any'thing about what
really happened. But this much is true: Whatever
went down has inspired T.R. Krright to come out
of his shell. Halting as he might be on some sub-
jects, ask him about intolerance. and his words
come out in a torrent. He's riled by the hypocrisy
of certain religions that teach God loves everyone
but then excludes gays (and other groups) .
'You are taught you are wrong, that you are
bad [So] you don't do anything, and you wrap
yourselfin a little straitjacket, and you put your-
self in your little room," says Knight. "'Don't do jf!
Don't look at someone, don't touch them, don,t
kiss them, don't do anythingl'Then maybe it's
OK. I mean, sure, that plagued me all through
childhood, you know, irl so many ways, arrd that's
stuff that's hard to get away I?om. But you have
to, and eventually, you know, you do."
Another topic that gets him going is marriage
equality. "I still get angry because we shouldn,t
even be havhg this conversation," he says. yes,
he sees signs of progress. "But we shouldn't be
having this conversation ot all. It disgusts me.',
ack in TV land, Knight's character recent-
ly married Dr. Callie Torres (Sara
Ramirez of Broadway's Spamalot). As of
now his character has slept with his crush,
Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), as well as his best
ffiend, Izzie (Katherine Heigl). That's quite a bit
of"action" for a gay actor, arrd it should provide at
least a bit of encouragement for other actors lurk-ing in the closet in order to protect their status
as romantic leads But this season-which in-
cluded the death of O'Malley's father-was
overshadowed in real life by "the incident."
Luckily, Knight has good friends on the
show. Heigl looks out for him. Tired of hearing
him idly wish for a dog, she gave him one-a
Lab mix he named Arrow-for his birthday this
year. Finding the puppy in his downtown apart-
ment is still a bit of a surprise for Knight.
"We're still looking at each other llke, Why
are you here? I'mllke, Don't cop an attitude. It's
me. I was here first. And she says, Iin more itn-
portant than you. And looh at me when I looh o.t
you with my cute little eyes. Don't you feel sorry
ror lne(
In other words, he's besotted. So Knight looks
forward to going home every day. But does he
look forward to going to work?
"I'm showing up and doing my job," says
Knight flatly, after yet another thoughtful
pause to choose his words "I'm getting paid to
play this role, and myjob is to do it to the best of
my ability, to pretend as best you can You
know, that's acting; that's why they hired me,
and that's what I do."
Many have suggested that if the roles had
been reversed-if Knight had directed a bigoted
slur at Washington-it would have seemed ob-
vious that Knight at least deserved to be fired
But Knight isn't interested in a debate over
which word is worse than which.
"I don't want to get into a word comparison-
this word versus that word," says Knight ,,All
those words are soaked in btood. Whatever word
it is, if it's the last word that someone screams
at you before you're killed-whether it's about
your sexuality or your religion or your race-
that's hate. That's all this is about And if people
need to learn that when it comes to sexual ori-
entation, then they need to learn that.
'You can't say one word is worse than anoth-
er unless you say one life is worth more than
another. You need to keep on educating and ed-
ucating the ignorant until they listen and hear
And understand. Not tolerate. But understand."
Knight is sure to be more politically active
in the future But getting him to talk about
what he's proud of isn't easy, even if he is
more willing to speak up than ever before.
"I'm proud of a lot of things," says Knight.
"I'm proud of some of my decisions this year
There are some I haven't been proud of, but
I'm proud of the ones pertaining to being
gay." He laughs "I'm not happy with what I

['T.R. Knight Is Just a Regular Guy," June
191. He has always been my favorite char-
acter on Grey's Anatomy, and it is great to
find out what he is like as a real person. I

continue to be an inspirationl

make you a hero, nor does having the
media out you in response to being called

to set T.R. apart from the other gay actors
who cite "privacy" as a convenient excuse
not to come out professionally, we must
remember that until Isaiah Washington
called T.R. thefword, he actually roos one
ofthose actors who chose to hide his orien-
tation professionally. While I have no
doubt that T.R. will now do extraordinari-
ly great things for the LGBT community,
we must be careful whom we label a hero.

Al Sharpton began his so-called advocacy

It's nice toseeThe Aduocale jumpingon
the autism awareness bandwagon without
resorting to the rhetoric ofcharacteizing
autism as a terrible tragedy, as something
that needs to be cured at any cost, or call-
ing us a blight on society. As a gay autistic,
I am equally as proud ofmy auhism as I
am ofbeing gay, and I do not want to be
cured of autism any more thal I want to be
cwed of being gay. Unfortunately, the arti
cle made no mention of the current state of
autism politics today, which is very similar
to GLBT politics ofdecades ago. Like the
GLBT community, many autistics have
objected to the pathologizing ofdifferences.
We believe autism is a valid expression of
human diversity and that we deserve firll
inclusion and acceptance-not to the
degree to which we can appear normal or
become nonautistic but as we are now.
