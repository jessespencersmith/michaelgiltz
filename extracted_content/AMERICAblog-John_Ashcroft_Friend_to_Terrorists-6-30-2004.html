John Ashcroft: Friend to Terrorists
by Michael in New York  on 6/30/2004 01:28:00 PM
Attorney General (and 2008 presidential hopeful) John Ashcroft is
coming under fire from both Republicans and Democrats for freeing a
suspected terrorist and sending him back to Syria. Numerous states
and other legal orgs were ready and willing to prosecute this suspect
but couldn't file charges before he was spirited away. The claim that
actually prosecuting the terrorist would have endangered national
security doesn't hold water for anyone involved. So what gives?
Conspiracy theorists -- on your mark, get set, go!
