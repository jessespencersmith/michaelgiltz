Bold: movies that have or likely will triple their reported
budgets. That's my standard for a movie being a box office hit
from theatrical alone. Many films will be profitable for a
studio even if they don't triple their reported budget, but it's
a good marker to indicate a big hit. 
ANALYSIS 
Some people are now calling Mufasa a "sleeper" hit. Umm, no $200mb
Disney film can be called a sleeper, especially a threequel to two movies
that each grossed more than $1b worldwide. Yes, it opened lower than
expected in North America. But it opened during the holiday season
from Christmas to New Year's when every day plays like a Saturday
because people traditionally flock to the movies, especially family films
like Mufasa. That's why I don't look at just North American box office
but worldwide box office. (And the box office for all seven days, not
just the weekend, a bizarre practice everyone else still follows.)
Worldwide, Mufasa: The Lion King  opened at #1 with $122m. Its
second week? Mufasa grossed $206m worldwide. Third week? $148m.
Those are not the grosses of a sleeper. 
I wouldn't say Conclave or A Complete Unknown are sleepers either.
They've got legs, though. Conclave is still bringing in bucks, proving a
force at the box office (which seemed obvious from opening weekend)
and the Oscar race (which I thought less likely because the film was
meh). The Bob Dylan biopic ticked up this week from $9m to $10m,THE ULTIMATE GRAMMY

<p>exactly what you want in an Oscar hopeful geared towards adults.
Word of mouth is clearly great, it should get plenty of Oscar love
(though maybe not Best Director?) and adults are turning out. If it
turns on more people to Bob Dylan's great music, all the better. 
Oh and the streaming miniseries turned blockbuster film Moana 2
crossed $1 billion worldwide. If nothing else, Bob Iger gets credit for
pushing it into theatrical. It and Red One are perfect arguments for
why any streamer spending $100m+ on a movie is crazy not to give
them wide releases in theatrical with big windows. In the case of
Moana 2, they're printing money. In the case of Red One, theatrical
was essentially a worldwide marketing campaign that paid for itself and
set the movie up for massive success on Amazon's Prime. My gosh, if
the movie does really week next holiday season and proves likely to be
a perennial, I'll bet in 2026 we see a sequel greenlit. 
Moana 2 is the 54th film in history to gross $1 billion worldwide. Soon,
the Top 100 Films of All Time  list will be renamed The Billionaire's
Club. How soon? If we generate four more each year, we'll get to The
Billionaire's Club by 2035. Just ten years. Probably sooner. What
movies in 2025 could hit the mark? Well, Avatar: Fire and Ash is a
given, plus almost certainly  Jurassic World: Rebirth (the last three
films have all grossed that much) and  Superman . Outside possibilities
include The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Thunderbolts*, Zootopia 2
(what took them so long?)  and even the live action remakes of  Lilo &
Stitch and How To Train Your Dragon. No, people are not remotely
tired of comic book movies or sequels. And surely one of them will
prove a big enough hit, so that makes four more likely movies grossing
$1 billion. Or in the case of Avatar: Fire and Ash, easily $2 billion. 
I saw Nosferatu, Nickel Boys and the reissue of Interstellar last week.
Nosferatu and Nickel Boys were both mightily impressive on a
technical level. I found Lily-Rose Depp terrific in a very difficult role.
But overall, the 1922 Nosferatu remains far creepier. It just didn't get
under my skin. I thought the lead in Nickel Boys was weak. I didn't like
his vocal performance long before I even saw the actor. (The film is
shot from the point of view of one character for much of the film, so we
hear him long before we see him.) However, I think costar Brandon
Wilson is very talented. As for Interstellar, I found it a puzzle box, a la
Inception. Happy to see it once but doubt I'd ever watch it again and
it's not match for Dunkirk, which remains my favorite Christopher
Nolan film by far. 
NOTE: One movie fell off my box office radar. The Indian action-
drama  Game Changer opened to $31m last week. This week? I can't get
any update. By all accounts it collapsed at the Indian box office. But
even a 90% drop worldwide would mean it still made $3m. I'll update
when numbers appear.

<p>1. Mufasa: The Lion King– $200mb 
2. Sonic The Hedgehog 3– $120mb 
3. Moana 2– Is the budget lower since it was intended for tv, at first?
Or higher because they had to rethink everything? Disney says it cost
$150mb, just like the original. You can bet Dwayne Johnson gets more
than his share of coconuts, but that won't matter with a hit like this.  
4. Nosferatu– $50mb for Robert Eggers, acclaimed director of The
Witch, The Lighthouse and The Northman. That had his biggest budget
and was not a commercial success. I saw him as more of an arthouse
guy. But backers stuck with him, gave him a big budget and a starry
cast for a remake of  Nosferatu, which I guess is classier than
remaking  Dracula but still a hard sell I thought. And on Christmas
Day? That's counter-programming I was not behind. Happily, I was
wrong and Eggers looks more like the next Peter Jackson/Guillermo
Del Toro than a guy given big budgets too fast or for the wrong
projects. Good for him! 
5. Octopus With Broken Arms aka Wu Sha 3 (Manslaughter 3)–
Chinese drama about businessman's daughter kidnapped from his
home. 
6. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera–$40mb for Gerard Butler action flick. 
7. Wolf Man–$25mb 
8. One of Them Days– $14mb.  It's always good to gross your budget
during a film's opening week. So yea for producer Issa Rae and this
comedy starring Keke Palmer and SZA. (What a week for SZA! Her
movie opens well and she makes my list of The 250 Best Albums of the
21st Century...So Far.
9. Wicked– $150mb for each part, so $300mb total plus beaucoup
marketing. It's a big movie! 
10. Big World– $29m ww debut. Chinese drama starring pop star and
actor Jackson Yee as a young man living with cerebral palsy. Yee has
gone from boyband TFBoys to having the Mandarin song of the year in
2017 to success in TV and film. How's his English, asks Hollywood? 
11. Honey Money Phony–Chinese rom-com about young woman
suddenly burdened with debt who falls for a (very handsome) young
con man. Will he go straight for her or teach her his wicked ways so she
can get out from under this financial disaster? 
12. A Complete Unknown–$60mb+ for this Bob Dylan biopic? That's a
lot of money for a film about Dylan going electric at Newport. I mean, I
want to see it but then I'm a Dylan fanatic. Off to a very good start and
star Timotheé Chalamet is sure to get an Oscar nomination, so it
should keep going. But $180m worldwide seems highly unlikely to me,
if not impossible. (Do other countries give a toss about this? Is
Chalamet a big enough draw for this story? I doubt it.) I'm glad it was
made, but it was made for too much. Like  Gladiator II, this will be seen
as a commercial success, but it's not. 3/24/25, 3:02 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  19, 2025

<p>13. Conclave– a reported $20mb for this Vatican thriller means this is
a hit. It's at $60m and still going strong, with a boost from potential
Oscar noms. I do  not see the point in putting it on PVOD and flooding
the market with bootlegs while potentially harming box office. This is
exactly the sort of film that can play and play in theaters.  
14. Gladiator II–$250mb for Ridley Scott sword and sandals epic. It
needs $750m worldwide for me to call it a hit from theatrical alone but
$600m would be just fine. It's got swords. It's got sandals. Does it have
legs? No, it does not. This is the sort of film that everyone thinks of as a
hit, but actually didn't deliver. The talk of  Gladiator 3 is nonsense.
Maybe many years from now they'll use the name to launch a new
franchise, but this is the end for now. 
15. Paddington in Peru–$50mb? I'm just guessing. (That's sort of
midpoint between the original and  Paddington 2.) Sadly, three times is
not the charm artistically for this once-perfect franchise.
16. Babygirl–$20mb for this Nicole Kidman sexy drama about a
powerful businesswoman finding her kink with a younger, dominating
man..her intern, no less! No milk was harmed in the making of this
movie. 
17. Harbin–A South Korean historical drama set in the early 1900s
about rebels fighting against the Japanese occupation of Korea. When
one rebel leader shows mercy to Japanese prisoners and his men pay
the price, he vows to redeem himself by assassinating the first Prime
Minister of Japan. So this one will probably  not have a good run in
Japan. 
18. Better Man–$110mb!!! I just gasped when I saw the budget. Oh
dear. I love the craziness of this movie. But that's a LOT of money for
such a nutty idea. And forget the nutty idea. It's a musical biopic about
an artist whose music I really like but has virtually no profile outside
the UK. For heaven's sake, Queen is one of the biggest acts in the world
and their biopic cost literally half of this one.  Better Man would have
been a big gamble at $30mb. 
19. The Brutalist–$10mb; Adrien Brody in this architect-as-hero period
drama.
20. Fake Dad–Chinese comedy. 
21. Detective Conan: Crossroad in the Ancient Capitol  (2003)–
China reissue of Japanese animated franchise entry. Film had $32m
before reissue in China. I mean, they keep making them so
I assume they're profitable. 
22. The Prosecutor–Chinese drama starring Donnie Yen, who uncovers
a deep conspiracy when a poor young man is framed for drug
trafficking. Not on Donnie's watch!
23. Finist. The First Warrior–a Russian fantasy film starring actor
Kirill Zaytsev as "the strongest, most agile, and handsome hero of
Belogorye," according to Wikipedia. Zaytsev certainly fits the bill,
though since Belogorye currently has fewer than 3000 people, that may3/24/25, 3:02 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  19, 2025

<p>not be such a major claim. Russians are surely starved for homegrown
cinema; it's been a while since Russian films made the charts. But I
couldn't even find a trailer for it on YouTube.
24. Hot Pot Artist aka Huo Guo Yi Shu Jia –A young Chinese man
dreams of becoming a film director, but somehow ends up running a
hot pot restaurant for artists, instead. 
25. The Firefighters–Korean drama with hot young newbie joining
firefighter squad, only to butt heads with a legendary veteran. 
26. The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim–per Screendollar, the
budget is $30mb for this animated prequel to  The Hobbit and  The Lord
of the Rings movies. Even at that price, it's a flop.  Taken solely from
minor footnotes in the novels, it was a gamble but a smart one. An
animated film won't be compared to Peter Jackson's masterpiece. (See:
the TV series.) And it's not retelling stories we've already heard. (See:
superhero movies that go back to the well by redoing an origin story for
Superman, Spiderman, et al.) Unfortunately, you still have to be good.
The trailer I saw disappointed and audiences are not responding. A
pity.
27. Homestead–faith-based post-apocalyptic drama from Angel
Studios. A survivalist fantasy. Based on a series of ten, poorly reviewed
novels.
28. The Last Showgirl–$2mb for Pamela Anderson's performance as
Vegas showgirl whose revue suddenly closes after 30 years. Not so fast,
Demi, says Anderson. 
NOTE: Game Changer–$45mb for Indian-Telugu political action film
w new politico uncovering corruption and kicking ass. Opened to
$32m, fell hard in India but surely it made some money in its second
week.
THE CHART AND HOW IT IS COMPILED 
This column is a week by week tracking of box office around the
world. It is compiled by pulling from every possible source: ComScore,
Box Office Mojo, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, Deadline, charts for
countries like China and India and South Korea, individual stories in
trade or general interest newspapers, Wikipedia and anyone else
discussing box office. 
ComScore Weekly Global Box Office Chart
The weekly charts contain the total gross for every movie in theaters
around the world during the last seven days. If a movie opens on a
Thursday, we include all the box office from Thursday through
Sunday. If it opens on a Tuesday night, we cover all six days. If it
opens on a Sunday (as some movies do in India or wherever,
depending on holidays), then we include the box office for that one
day. If a movie was released before the current week, we include the
box office for all seven days. Why ignore the box office from Monday
through Thursday, as most charts do when tallying the latest weekend
and focusing on new releases? 3/24/25, 3:02 PM POPSURFING.COM: WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE FOR WEEK ENDING JANUARY  19, 2025
