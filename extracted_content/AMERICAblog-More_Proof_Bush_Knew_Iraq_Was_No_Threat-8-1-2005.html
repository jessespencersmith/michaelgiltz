8/01/2005 06:40:00 PMA CIA spy is suing their former employer. Why? Because hewas fired for telling the truth.In a lawsuit filed in federal court here in December, theformer C.I.A. officer, whose name remains secret, said thatthe informant told him that Iraq's uraniumenrichment program had ended years earlier and thatcentrifuge components from the scuttled programwere available for examination and even purchase....In his lawsuit, he says his dismissal was punishment forhis reports questioning the agency's assumptions ona series of weapons-related matters. Among otherthings, he charged that he had been the target ofretaliation for his refusal to go along with the agency'sintelligence conclusions.How many people need to come forward before the American peoplerealize Bush lied to them? Oh, wait, the American people already dorealize Bush lied to them. So why doesn't the MSM keep poundingaway? Is it really "old news" that Bush lied to the American people inthe State of the Union address, ignored all the facts pointing in onedirection and went in another, "fixed up" the intelligence according tohis closest ally the British and fired anyone who spoke up andsmeared anyone who dared to go public?We were attacked by Al Quaeda and the Taliban that harbored them.Why did Bush invade Iraq?
