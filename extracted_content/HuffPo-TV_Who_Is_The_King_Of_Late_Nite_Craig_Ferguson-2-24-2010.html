Last night (Tuesday/Wednesday from 12:30 am to 1:30 am), Craig Ferguson delivered another brilliant
night of TV by simply doing away with the audience and talking for one hour to one guest. Of course, he
loaded the deck by making that guest the endlessly witty, clever, insightful, thoughtful talk show-guest-
of-your-dreams Stephen Fry. But still, it was an arresting, wonderful hour akin to the glory days of DickCavett when he would just spend a day or two or an entire week talking to someone that fascinated him
(and therefore us).
Craig Ferguson and Stephen Fry roamed over the landscape: their friendship, the remarkable success of
pal Hugh Laurie, drug addiction, Fry's bi-polar disorder (is disorder rude? bi-polar-ishness?), Twitter as
it links to poetry and telegrams and the missives of our Founding Fathers, as well as the rather
remarkable suggestion that Fry (a genuinely beloved figure in the UK) might consider becoming a UScitizen. If you missed it, do watch it online.  The show reminded me how much I enjoy Ferguson, how
refreshing he is and of an idea I've had but yet to execute.
For months now I've planned to spend a week and watch every minute of every major late night talk
show and then declare a winner. Who is the king of late night, I wanted to know. Of course, I've watched
everyone in bits and pieces and I'll tape any show with a guest I'm especially keen on, particularly

<p>musical guests. So let's face it: I already knew who I believed was the king of late night.
I hoped to be -- and was open to being -- surprised or at least discover something new about some of the
hosts. But would my ranking change much? I doubt it; not after years (sometimes decades) of watching
these people work. My plan was foiled by all the late night folderol, which threw everything into turmoil.
But the result of years of watching and a certain keen anticipation for my proposed task -- which led me
to pay closer attention even to the likes of Jimmy Kimmel -- is this:
DAVID LETTERMAN  -- is in a class of his own. He's already ascended to the pantheon, alongside
Johnny Carson, Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Dick Cavett and just a few others. He's not coasting by any
means. But his legacy is assured, so he doesn't get ranked alongside the others.
JAY LENO  -- gets no respect from critics like me and certainly his monologue doesn't deserve it. But he
can squeeze out the odd strange fact from a guest a la Larry King just by his own disingenuousness. He's
a genuinely nice guy so it's interesting that his funniest bits involve (gently) mocking the stupidity of
regular folk via Jaywalking.
JIMMY KIMMEL  -- bad standup, bad with guests unless that guest is his ex, the hilarious Sarah
Silverman.
JIMMY FALLON  -- makes Jimmy Kimmel look good. He's the Merv Griffin of late night, with every
guest a dear dear friend and his most penetrating comment being "that's hilarious" or "that's great"
followed by a giggle. He's so nervous and awkward in interviews it's painful to watch, with Fallon
invariably gushing or talking over the guest or coming up with some inane comment. Perfectly likable
guy in other contexts but a genuine flop as an interviewer of any sort, which is indeed a major job of the
talk show host. You feel bad for him.
CONAN O'BRIEN  -- he was just starting to get his rhythm in the earlier time slot. I pooh-poohed the
idea that a guy who'd been doing a talk show for more than a decade could need time to adjust but 11:30
is indeed a whole new ballgame. Happily, Andy Richter had finally moved to the couch where he
belonged. But even after all these years, Conan remains a very, very bad interviewer unless the guest is
someone he deeply cares about or is a woman he's deeply attracted to. He can be funny on his feet ofcourse. But Conan is glued desperately to his note cards and regularly makes the most awkward
transitions imaginable, ruining any possibility of believing for a moment that he and his guest are
actually just talking rather than hitting on pre-arranged talking points. The comedy bits save him, as doesRichter's invaluable presence.
Which brings me to...CRAIG FERGUSON  -- the new king of late night. (With Letterman as the philosopher-king some miles
above him and already sainted/knighted/whatever one does with great late night talk show hosts). He's
been charming the pants off us for some 1,000 shows now and doing it effortlessly. I wondered if his
signature tossing away of his note cards when a guest sits down is a pointed slam at Conan but he doesn't
seem a nasty person. It's just his way of ensuring that they talk and he stays focused on the conversationrather than some scribbled idea for a question. He has the gift of gab of course.
Craig proved last night he doesn't need an audience. But he proves every night that he barely needs
guests. Ferguson can chat away and be thoroughly engaging for more than half an hour before he brings
out a guest. Then if he gets into a good rhythm with someone, he regularly just keeps talking with them
and bumps the other guest and the musical act (if any). I do feel sorry for the second guest or the musicalact (as well as the booker) because they are shunted aside so very often. But they're probably enjoyingthemselves too much in the green room to care. He can be silly, serious, insightful, frivolous and just
about any other appealing adjective you can imagine. His most important gift is perhaps the ability to
make us believe he's just having fun, just trying to please himself and do what amuses him. And thatwe're just clever enough to be in on the fun and enjoy it too.
The puppets, the musical lip-syncing numbers that sometimes open the show, the end of show moment
where he rambles about what we've learned on the show that night, all of it is loose and silly enough to
create an air of potential anarchy when of course he works like the devil to prepare so he can relax during
the taping and let things happen. Like Letterman, he enjoys himself and is very funny. Like Cavett, he canspeak intelligently about almost anything. Like Paar, he can dive into a serious monologue and dogenuine soul-searching (about the death of his father, out of control pop stars, Rush Limnaugh and Haiti)
that is absolutely riveting. Like Johnny, he allows his guests to shine; nothing gives him more pleasure
than an entertaining guest. He is, indeed, the new king of late night.

15 FansI have not watched all of the late night talk show hosts, but I couldn't disagree more with the
negative comments on Jay Leno. I love his monologue and find it consistent ly much better than
anyone else other than the great late Johnny Carson. But Jay is on a par with Carson and that risesto greatness in the world of comedy. Jay is superb with guests, especially ones he has teased suchas Palin, Seacrest, Simpson, various Presidents and so forth. His Jay Walking and Battle of theAllstars might seem to tease others, but I get the feeling he actually loves them and the teasing isjust fun. I also feel they love him in return.
Jay rules, has ruled for years and still has lots of fuel in the tank.Read me: http://The HarvView.b logspot.co m
Good article. I agree with most of the points, except...Sarah Silverman is NOT funny. No one has yet explained what makes her funny. She over reaches
and mostly just shocks. Her schick is tired and NOT funny. When was the last time she actuallywrote a joke. 
On the other hand, Mr. Furgeson is naturally funny and charming and doesn't have to kiss a dogs
ass to get cheap laughs. Did I say Sarah Silverman is NOT funny?
Peace,
Tex Shelters
Couldn't agree more!
About the no promotion thing - I think that's absolutely genius and done very deliberate ly. 
Firstly it fits in perfectly with the no-budget, no-band, holes in the roof schtick. 
Secondly, note how many people on this thread say that they 'discovere d' Craig. People get to
Craig on their own, make their own decisions about him and become immensely proprietor ial. Word
of mouth is through the roof and CraigyFerg 's Robot Skeleton Army (of which I count myself a
proud member) on Twitter is rabid.
Love this guy. Hate that he's on so late. But love this guy.

I dislike Fallon enought to the point of feeling sorry for him. He had Horatio Sanz as a guest for like
35 mins. Wow, either he owed him or the guest well was drying up.
As for Kimmel: he's on only cuz ABC weaseled out on Maher and fired him for being relevant.
Good point about Jimmy Kimmel, but the good thing about Bill Maher not being on ABC
anymore is that on HBO he is allowed to be himself where as on ABC his teeth would hadbeen taken out. 
And to be completely honest, I haven't watched a lot of Kimmel since his show premiered,
in what 2003?
I like Craig. I don't watch his show oftet but his book was great. I had the audio book so it wasreally cool to listen to him tell his stories (as it were).
I guess Jon Stewart wouldn't be considered late night talk show...but I like still him better.
But this, 'JIMMY FALLON -- makes Jimmy Kimmel look good.....i t's painful to watch,...g enuine flop
as an interviewe r of any sort... You feel bad for him.'
is SOOOOO spot on. I cringe whenever I watch his show (which isn't that often for that exact
reason.)
On the subject of the interviews , I think the rankings would go #1 Craig Ferguson, close #2
would be either Stewart or Colbert, then Letterman would be 4th, then I don't know.
He's the best. Then Bonnie Hunt who is still relegated to daytime.I'm still deciding about Wanda Sykes.
Johnny Carson -- raised the bar on late night TV to a whole new standard. He had a connection toanothersunnyday    06:10 PM on 2/28/2010

136 Fanshis guests and audience that was outstandin g.
David Letterman -- is class, but still has not surpassed Johnny. 
Craig Ferguson -- Is the first late night host since Carson to live up to that same high standard of
both humor and honesty. He is the new king of late night.
Bring on the hate! I just drove in from Austin where I spent about an hour with Craig Ferguson. Of
course my daughter and about 1500 people were there. 
He was hysterical and made good use of the "f" word. In fact, I doubt that I've ever laughed more at
that word. He was brilliant in his use of THE word. 
My daughter has never watched his late night show so she was a bit taken aback and alarmed
when he closed the show with "Oops, I've Done it Again" and I leapt to my feet and joined in thesinging. Leather Boy and the other guy were there and besides "singing" with him for the closer,they both came out and danced around just before Craig came on. 
IT WAS WONDERFUL! !!!!!!!!!
DARN RIGHT he's the king of late night! My favorite by far. TV schedule as follows: Stewart,
Colbert, then Ferguson. Oh my, how I love this Scottish lad.
Just discovered Craig Ferguson this year and I LOVE him!! He's sweet and so very funny. 
You are right on--Letter man and Ferguson are great men of late night.
Letterman and the rest are toast !!
