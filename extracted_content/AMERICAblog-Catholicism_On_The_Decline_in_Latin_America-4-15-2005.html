4/15/2005 12:12:00 PMHow effective was the papacy of John Paul II? The LA Timeshas been running a series of articles on the state of theChurch. The latest looks at Latin America, where Catholicismwas once so completely dominant it boggles the mind. Nowevangelical Christians are gorwing by leaps and bounds. Perthe LA Times:In countries where Catholics once accounted for more than90% of the population, evangelicals now constitute asignificant religious minority, sometimes with social andpolitical clout beyond their numbers.In Chile, Honduras and Brazil, for example, about 15% ofthe population describes itself as evangelical Protestant.The figure rises to 22% in El Salvador; in Guatemala, it's25%. In Mexico's southern Chiapas state, local pressreports estimate the evangelical population to be 36% ofadults.Paraguay, albeit still overwhelmingly Catholic, now has itsfirst evangelical president, Nicanor Duarte Frutos. PresidentAlvaro Uribe of Colombia made news when he triedreaching out to evangelicals, who now make up about 10%of the country's population.How'd they do it? Much like in the US -- the media. They've beenbuying up TV and radio stations, training ministers in months insteadof years, capitalizing on the Catholic Church's entanglement in somany governments, and generally being smarter and more nimble.One simple fact remains: the Catholic Church grew from 750 millionto 1 billion during JP II's reign. But without enough priests to ministerto them (the shortage of priests in Latin America is so severe peoplecan go six months to a year without seeing one), how will the flock betended?
