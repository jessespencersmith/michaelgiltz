cO 'Flicka/ 'StormbreakerJ and 
other live-action family films 
take on animated kidsJ flicks 
BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
ive-action family films used to be a staple of Holly­
wood. Vehicles used to be built around child stars like 
Shirley Temple and Freddie Bartholomew. Disney 
made a mint by offering fun, entertaining movies like 
"Swiss Family Robinson" and "Old Yeller." Lassie and 
Rin Tin Tin were big stars. And the films they appeared in 
were enjoyed by the whole family. 
Nowadays, most family films fall inl0 ~--:--;:::==~ __ ~--__ -::: ..... -~ 
two categones: big·budget animated fare 
like the Pixar offerings (such as "Cars" 
and 'The Incredibles") or this past week· 
end's No, 1 hit "Open Season," or huge· 
budget franchises like the" Harry Potter" 
and now "Chromeles of N amia" series 
This Friday, "Alex Rider: Operation 
Stormbreaker" -the story of a teenage 
James Bonel·like hero -hopes to buck 
the trend. as does "Flicka." a family film 
about a girl and her horse, on Oct. 20. 
And in December , "Charlotte's Web," 
with Dakota Fanning , and "Eragon " will 
try to wow 'em during the holiday. 
"My hope for the movie was that this 
was a movie that parents could take 
their kids to," says Anthony Horowitz, 
who penned the best·selling Alex Rider 
books and wrote the script for the film, 
which stars Alex Pettyter in the title 
role, along with Ewan McGregor, Bill 
Nighy and Alicia Silverstone . 
"That's what 1 was really aiming for 
when I wrote the screenplay I'm a dad, 
and I've taken my children to so many 
films that made me squirm with embar· 
rassment when my kids were smaller. 
The idea was. Here is a familv film that 
the whole family can see But does that 
actually happen anymore')" 
A good question -do families go 
to movies to~ether anymore? Increas· 
ingly. they tal(e one of two options'. ei· 
ther the family splits up at the multi· 
plex. \vith the parents seeing one !TIcwie, teenagers another and little kids a third; 
or they take their 8·year-old along to 
see PG-13·rated fare like "Pirates of 
the Caribbean' Dead Man's Chest" or 
"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky 
Bahby," a PG·l~ movie that included

"It's very hard nowadays," says Maltin, 
famed for his authoritative best·selling 
"Movie Guide." "Everyone seems to agree

are ignored. This fall's gentle remake of

But from age 6 up, appar· 
ently, it's no holds barred_ I The audience that Walt Dis·

Some fitIn companies and mOVIe Sfll­

of the soon·to·be·sequeled "Chronicles 
of Namia" -have made "Holes," "Hoot"

"We had one studio that wanted 
10 make the picture but only if we 
made Alex 18 and gave him a car and" 
girl." laughs Horowitz, who has also creat· 
ed the hit TV myslerv series "Foyle's War."

HANG IN THERE "Alex Rider: Operation 
Stormbreaker" Is based on a book series. 
at the box office by "Spider-Man"? 
Maybe. says Horowitz . 
"Families naturally are gravitating to· 
ward these huge blockbuster movies," 
says Horowitz _ "The movie of the sum­
mer in Britain was without any question 
'Pirates of the Caribbean 2,' despite a crit· 
ical response that could have floored it, 
frankly -[but] made not a bit of differ· 
ence to its box-office success. It was a 
tidal wave that to some extent took some 
of our [overseas] audience with it as 
well." ("Operation Stormbreaker" has al· 
ready opened in the U.K.) 
Just as disturbing to Maltin is how the 
desire to reach the broadest audience 
possible makes studios rum R·rated mov­
ies into "hard" PG-J3 films and avoid a G· 
rating at all costs. But he takes solace in 
the success of movies like "March of the 
Penguins, " and the response he sees to 
classic entertainments . 
"There's an annual silent· movie event 
in LA .. and a lot of families come to see 
Charlie Chaplin or Harold Lloyd or Bust· 
er Keaton with a live orchestra," says 
Maltin "Most of the kids have never seen 
a silent before. I'm sure. And to hear 
the kids' laughter -the highest·pitched 
laughter -above the crowd is hearten· 
ing. It says these films still work." • They are family -sort of 
Aglance at the top-grossing 
movies of 2006 finds a 
lot of movies that families 
watched together -but were 
they appropriate for everyone? 
Here's a rundown at recent films 
and the issues they raise. M;G. 
"PIRATES OF THE CARIB­
BEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST" 
Kids loved Johnny Depp's goofy 
hero (right) and the silly stunts. 
Adults dug the ironic tone and 
special effects. But this PG·13 
film still had some. inten-se vio­
lence that made younger kids 
shiver their timbers. 
"X-MEN; THE LAST STAND" 
The finale to the comic-book fran· 
cllise included all sorts of mayhem, including 
the traumatic deaths of beloved main charaG­
ters. Teenagers got into it, but younger comics 
fans saw the difference between on·the-page 
and movie violence. 
"TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD 
OF RICKY BOBBY" Another family favorite, 
thanks to the goofy Will i'errell, who comes off as the silly older brother every­
one wishes they had_ But this 
movie had a lot of sexual innu· 
endo. "Elf," it sure wasn't. 
"THE BENCHWARMERS" 
This Rob Schneider vehicle 
about nerds getting revenge 
when they finally get to play 
baseball is filled with family· 
friendly content: It's all about 
teamwork and giving everyone 
a chance. If Disney had made 
it, it COUld've been G-rated. But 
the studio wanted to make sure 
Schneider's fans turned up, so 
they made a cruder PG-13 film. 
"EIGHT BELOW" Disney's 
dogs-in-perll adventure had a 
classic feel and scored well at ttle box office. 
It earned a strong $81 million despite a "soft" 
PG (because the dogs were in peril and for 
some mild language). But it proves a family 
film-can succeed, and tell a cool tale to boot. 
"SUPERMAN RETURNS" A kid-friendly hero 
in a flashy revamp, but intense scenes with 
Lex Luthor. made It much too dark.</p>
