American Dreams: 
Season One **** Universal, $89.98 
This delightful drama set in 
the '60s was overlooked by the 
Emmys, but you've got no 
excuses. Whether you prefer the 
wholesomeness of "7th Heaven," 
the sharp, ensemble acting of 
"The West Wing" or the soapy 
delights of "The O.c.," this show 
has it all. And anyone looking for 
the next Julia Roberts should 
look no further than star 
Brittany Snow. 
Soul Plane: 
Special Edition **'/2 MGM,$26.98 
An R-rated, silly satire about 
the hippest airline in the world 
with its fair share of laughs, 
thanks to Mo'Nique, Snoop 
Dogg and Method Man. Also 
out in a slightly naughtier, 
unrated edition, though both 
have the same basic extras. 
Another goofy comedy just out 
is the 10th-anniversary edition 
of Kevin Smith's career-maker, 
"Clerks 10" (Miramax, $34.99), 
. full of extras on three discs. 
Soul to Soul *** Rhino, $24.99 
Any discussion of great 
concert fIlms is usually 
restricted to "Woodstock," "Stop Columbo: 
First Season *** Universal, $59.98 
The rumpled 
detective hits DVD, 
with all seven TV 
movies from the fIrst 
season and the two 
TV movies that 
introduced Peter Falk 
as Columbo before 
the show became a 
series. 
One more question: 
Why no extras? Other 
popular detectives 
out on DVD include 
the fIrst season of the 
mustachioed 
"Magnum, P.!''' 
(Universal, $59.98) 
and the trench-coated 
third seaSon of "A 
Touch of Frost" (MPI, 
$49.98). 
Making Sense" and "The Last 
W~tz." The canon exPands with 
this look at artists like Wilson 
Pickett and Ike and Tina Thrner. 
The soundtrack is included as an 
extra. Another disc just as 
memorable for the off "stage 
action is "Wattstax 30th 
Anniversary Special Edition" 
(Warner Bros., $24.98), with 
performances by Isaac Hayes 
and others, an intro by Jesse 
Jackson and the comedy of 
Richard Pryor. 
La Dolce Vita 
***'/2 Koch, $34.98 
Fellini's crazy three-ring 
extravaganza about the jaded; 
frantic life of the jet set, with 
Anita Ekberg dancing in that 
fountain, "paparazzi" becoming 
part of the language and 
Marcello Mastroianni looking 
world-weary. Finally on DVD 
with audio commentary, rare 
shorts and more. But before 
Fellini became "Fellini," he made 
some of his most perceptive 
movies, like the thoughtful 
second fIlm, "I Vitelloni" 
(Criterion, $29.95).</p>
