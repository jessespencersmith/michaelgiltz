8/26/2005 06:54:00 PMHere's a link to a very general outline of the proposed IraqiConstitution. One section caught my eye and should give Bushpause:Chapter Two -- Article 35 -- c. All kinds of physical andpsychological torture and inhumane treatment areprohibited, and any confession is considered void if it wastaken by force, threats and torture. The person who washarmed has the right to ask for compensation for thefinancial and moral damage he/she suffered.Apparently, these Iraqis don't have the stomach for fighting terror,the wimps. So as soon as this Constitution is in effect, Bush betterget the Iraqis to give US soldiers immunity from the law. You can'texpect Bush to defend democracy without using torture, can you?
