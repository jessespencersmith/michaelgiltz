            <p>Thoroughly Modern 
RSC star Alex Jennings plays the tormented prince at BAM. 
Alex Jennings is relaxing back­
stage -well, recovering, real­
ly -after an afternoon perfor­
mance of Hamlet for the Royal 
Shakespeare Company in London. An 
evening show looms ahead, along with 
a U.S. tour hitting BAM May 21-30, 
but the 40-year-old actor 
takes on all questions with 
an easy demeanor. He 
laughs when reminded he 
once said it was "a load of 
bollocks" that Hamlet is the 
role by which all actors 
should be measured. 
"It is a load of bollocks," 
Jennings says. "However, I 
now understand why it is 
the thing it is. It was a part 
I never hankered after par­
ticularly, and I was sur­
prised when I was asked to 
do it. I thought Peer Gynt 
was my chance at that kind 
of part, and it's been fantas­
tic to be able to do both. It 
requires a huge emotional 
commitment -more than 
any part -which is why it 
is what it is. It has to do 
with who you are at the 
time of life that you're play­
ing it, and how you respond 
to those ideas and those thoughts and 
those amazing, amazing words." 
Jennings earned an Olivier Award 
as Best Actor for Peer Gynt, but suc­
cess hasn't made him cautious. His 
Hamlet is a low-key, modern-dress 
affair with Jennings providing blackly 
28 May 22, 1998 InTheater By Michael Giltz 
hun10rous line readings and whipping 
out a Polaroid at one point. There's 
even a brief black-and-white film at 
the beginning, which features 
Jennings ' own son as a young Hamlet 
frolicking in the snow. 
"I do sort of the odd funny voice 
and odd impersonation, and a contem­
porary setting allows you to use that," 
he explains. "I feel it's a legitimate 
response: Hamlet's playing games all 
the time. I say 'A knavish speech sleeps 
in a foolish ear' like Humphrey Bogart 
and there's another one I do a bit like Groucho Marx. I was a bit worried," 
he admits drolly. "I thought that I 
wasn't being melancholy enough." 
Since Hamlet has 'been staged 
thousands of times in every way imag­
inable -a one-man show; an all 
female cast; and even as a musical -
it's surprising how furi­
ous some critics were 
that the RSC "dared" 
to cut the opening 
scene and trim all the 
political plotting. 
"I do sort of feel, 
'Well, all right. If you 
don't like it, then you 
have a go,' " Jennings 
says. "It seems to me 
ridiculous and narrow­
minded. We're not a 
museum. It has to be 
reassessed every time. 
Go ahead and read it if 
you're so furious. Go 
and watch the film. It's 
nothing new. Laurence 
Olivier cut the first 
scene. It's our take on 
the play, our response 
to the play; not every­
body is going to like it, 
but you can't do these 
plays the same every 
time. I feel very, very strongly that it's 
intelligently adapted and we're consis­
tent in the angle we've taken." 
That angle was found in collabo­
ration with director Matthew 
Warchus (Tony-nominated for his 
work on Art), who joined the produc-</p>
<p>tion after Jennings and shared his 
star's admiration for Baz Lurhmann's 
film Romeo + Juliet. 
"You couldn't always hear what 
people were saying but it didn't mat­
ter," Jennings says of the movie. "I 
found it very moving, which I've never 
found Romeo and Juliet before. I was 
moved by Leonardo DiCaprio and 
Claire Danes particularly. It was beau­
tiful. As long as you know why you're 
doing it, why you're setting it where it 
is, then I say to those people on the 
battlements, 'So what?' " 
Never fancying he'd have a go at 
Hamlet, Jennings is little influenced by 
the stage productions he's seen -he 
admired Mark Rylance's take -and has 
screened almost none of the 
movies. "When we were 
rehearsing, I did start to 
watch a bit of the Nicol 
Williamson film, which I'd 
never seen, and I was very 
excited by what he was doing 
-so I had to turn it off." He 
also admits to being happily 
surprised by the bits he's seen 
of one other Hamlet: Mel 
Gibson's. "I thought he was 
really good; yeah, he's a 
proper actor. Why not a 
Hamlet of clanking armor 
and swords?" 
Such seeming contra­
diction is familiar territory 
for Jennings. Born in Upminster, he 
first took to the stage after being 
inspired by a professor named Mr. 
Broughton . 
"He made me realize I could do 
things I couldn't imagine; suddenly 
something was possible," says 
Jennings. "But in my first show, I did­
n't learn my lines at all. I just hadn't 
bothered, hadn't prepared. I went on 
stage and got some laughs, but I just 
ruined it for the others. Afterwards, 
someone saw me backstage in a corner 
looking miserable and asked Mr. 
Broughton why I looked so terrible, 
and he said, "Because he fucked up," 
which was so devastating because it 
was true. I've always been prepared 
since and never forgotten my lines, 
knock on wood." 
He's far from an upper-class public 
school actor-laddie, but Jennings made his name playing a charming fop 
in numerous plays, especially 
Ostrovsky's comedy Too Cleve't' by Half 
at the Old Vic in 1988. He attended 
the same theater school in Bristol as 
Daniel Day-Lewis -though at a dif­
ferent year -but his film work has 
been modest. He became one of the 
RSC's principal stars just as the com­
pany endured a fallow period, shunt­
ing aside critical brickbats for every­
thing from heretical productions (see 
Hamlet) to the company's decision to 
shorten its London season in favor of 
more performances in other parts of 
Great Britain. The latter issue is the 
only one that truly stirs Jennings' 
anger, and he defends it passionately. 
"The bad press that the company's 
had about abandoning London -
which we haven't done at all; we sim­
ply have a slightly shorter season -is 
complete crap," he declares. "Those 
critics should have seen the people in 
these cities away from London, people 
who don't get theater and were so 
grateful about being offered 13 plays 
in four weeks. They were travelling 
two hours to the show and two hours 
back afterwards and then doing it 
again a few nights later. It was really, 
really encouraging ." 
Also encouraging are the packed 
houses attending Hamlet during its 
London run. Jennings hopes to have a 
better go at the U.S. this time around, 
after taking a rapturously received 
Midsummer Night's D't'eam on tour and 
then to Broadway in 1996, where it 
did only moderately well. "In Washington, D.C., we had 
silence during the show but standing 
ovations at the end, which was odd," 
he remembers. "I was told it was the 
government . You would look out and 
you'd see rows of suits and posh frocks 
and they sort of wouldn't laugh, but 
they regularly gave a standing ovation. 
It was bizarre. In San Francisco, we 
were in a 3,OOO-seater, which was 
madness really. Huge. And then the 
first week of performances in New 
York, maybe because it was the first 
time the RSC had been on Broadway 
for a long time, we had a lot of RSC 
groupies who were just happy that we 
were there. They laughed at every­
thing. That was hard, too, because you 
really had to keep a grip on 
your performance. But to be 
perfectly honest, we were 
fairly tired by the time we 
got to Broadway -we'd 
been on the road a long 
time. Not that San Francisco 
deserves less than New York, 
but it wasn't ideaL" 
Quite handsome, Jen­
nings has no excuse for not 
being more famous outside 
the theater -except for the 
fact that he finds so little 
time to do work outside the 
theater. The film version of 
A Midsumme't' Night's Dream 
was done in a scant four 
weeks and, according to J erinings, on 
too low a budget and without being 
rethought for film. A more satisfying 
recent role was as the dissolute barris­
ter Lord Mark in The Wings of a Dove. 
"Ten days, nice part, not too much 
responsibility, and a trip to Venice," he 
laughs, enumerating the good points. 
When his Hamlet tour is over, 
Jennings will take a break, relaxing at 
home with his landscape -gardener mate 
and two young children, waiting for 
"those mythic opportunities." If there's a 
street Jennings should walk up and 
down to make clear to producers that 
he's available for more TV and film 
work, he'd be happy to go there, he 
insists. "But I don't know where it is." •
