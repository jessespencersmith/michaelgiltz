THEATER: "The Prisoner" Can't Get Free
THE  PRISONER  ** out of ****
THEATRE  FOR  A  NEW  AUDIENCE  AT  POLONSKY
SHAKESPEARE  CENTER
Legendary director Peter Brook returns with this fable-like story about
a young man punished for an unspeakable crime. The story ispresented on a mostly bare stage with a minimum of props. The castincludes some actors for whom English is a second language (whichmakes them one up on me) and so they speak slowly and stiffly. The
Prisoner  is quiet, elusive and ultimately as tad confounding and one is
made to feel a rube for thinking so -- no wonder they applaud us at the
end, as if to gently pat us on the head for grappling with their art. It isadmirable, of course; how could something involving Peter Brook and
his longtime collaborator Marie-Hélène Estienne not be admirable?
But it is far from satisfying.
The narrative is so slim I will begin where Brook begins: with his note
in the Playbill explaining the show's genesis. He traveled to
Afghanistan and saw a man sentenced to an odd fate: he must sit
outside a prison and face it, only leaving when he felt justified in doingso. Recognizing prison as a dehumanizing force, the idea was that thisman might atone for his crimes, "repair" himself and go on to aproductive life, rather than just being punished. Brook was intrigued
by this image, it stayed with him and many years later he created this
play, co-writing and co-directing it with Estienne.
So we see a young man in the aftermath of a terrible deed. His uncle
sees the brutal life in prison and convinces a judge to change the
sentence to the one described above. And so the young sits on a hill
near some woods, facing a prison. Years pass as he is accosted by orsimply encounters locals, an executioner, guards, a fellow prisoner andtravelers. As one might expect for such an internal struggle, TheMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>Prisoner  is meditative, modest and demands your full attention for its
85 minute running time. That attention is not squandered but neither
is it rewarded.
In real life, Brook never found out what the "unspeakable crime"committed by the prisoner actually was. For the play, they inventedone and more's the pity. An unspeakable crime has a lovely, fable-likeambiguity to it. Instead of a terrible crime, the play plainly states that
the young man's father had recently been widowed. When the boy
came home, he found his father in bed with the boy's sister -- in arage, the son killed his dad. Patricide, even over a dreadful crime likethat, is a tremendous taboo throughout history. But the incestuous act
becomes a tremendous roadblock for the rest of the play.
First it explains what the young man did. Then he confesses his real
fear: that it was a crime of jealousy, not rage and that he too wants an
incestuous relationship with his sister. Then his sister tells him to stop
all this self-flagellating nonsense and come home and be a father to thechild she has born from sleeping with their dad. (It's unclear to me butshe seems to be offering herself as his lover in the bargain.) When heturns her down, she drops off the kid with their uncle and heads to
America to become a doctor. And the uncle tells the prisoner that yes,
many cultures look down on incest but when he saw the fathersleeping with the daughter, the uncle saw only love.
What the hell? Brook is not making any argument about Afghanistan's
culture -- indeed, the show itself is explicitly universal and located
nowhere in particular. Why in heaven's name he decided to introduce
incest and then make everyone BUT the prisoner seem fine with it --and to no particular purpose -- escapes me. You're so confused by theslow drip of details (it takes half the play or longer for all this
information to get out) that it keeps you from understanding the
motives of everyone involved...except the prisoner, who is the only onebeing punished. I'd be perfectly happy -- if dubious -- to watch adrama where characters argue cheerfully for incest. But The  Prisonerdoesn't so much argue for it as simply mention it in passing and thenThe Movies, Books, Theater,

<p>furrow its brow over your parochial complaints.
All of this is offered in a scrupulously poetical setting. Very little of it
has dramatic heft, though Hiran Abeysekera as the prisoner and
Hayley Carmichael as the wide-eyed traveler (and other roles) keepour attention when center stage. Nonetheless, running times matterand when a play is said to run 70 minutes but actually runs 85minutes, that's telling. Running 20% long is a sure sign of actors
indulging themselves or more likely here struggling to find something
to play. It would be churlish to say one was a prisoner at this drama --I'd rather see a failed work by real artists over a failed work ofcommercial pap any day of the week and Brook is indeed legendary.
But whatever insight into human nature and crime and punishment
this show strives for remains a mystery.
