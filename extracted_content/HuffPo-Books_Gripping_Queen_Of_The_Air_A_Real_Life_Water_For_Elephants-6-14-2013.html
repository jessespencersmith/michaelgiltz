QUEEN OF THE AIR  By Dean N. Jensen
$26.00 hardcover
Crown
An unattractive cover is the only flaw in this otherwise thoroughly gripping, melodramatic
true story of one of the most famous circus performers of all time. Queen Of The Airbegins with a family on hard times that reluctantly allows its little daughter to go away on
tour throughout Latin America with a traveling circus. She is abused by the owner yet
rises to become one of the greatest acts in the world. But she's not the star of this story.
Her daughter from that rape turns into a prodigy of prodigies called Leitzel, the Queen Of
The Air. Among the many unlikely events that pepper this true story: the mother iswracked with guilt that she had to ignore her children for her career but is insanely jealouswhen the little girl almost immediately outshines her. Leitzel leaps from success tosuccess with her dazzling skill as an aerialist and is soon the top attraction at the biggestcircus in the world. There a young nobody in the circus falls in love with her.
That teenage boy Alfredo gets to smooch with Leitzel but she's really only dallying with
him. They both marry others but Alfredo is determined to become worthy of her...andturns into a member of the Flying Codona Brothers, ultimately becoming perhaps the firstman in history to regularly perform the literally death-defying triple somersault whiletraveling at 60 miles per hour. More than a decade later and now world famous himself,Alfredo reunites with the woman he always loved.
She loves him too and they get married. But she loves fame ever so slightly more and is too used to flitting from lover to loverfor the jealous Alfredo's taste. Romance, high society, passion, disdain, celebrity, money, madness, bold gambles, tragicfailures -- it's all here in a tale that you would scoff at if it weren't true.
A real life Water For Elephants  is the inevitable comparison for Queen Of The Air. Author Dean N. Jensen took literally
decades to tell this story right; everyone he initially interviewed is dead now. It was worth the wait. The result is one of the most
improbable and entertaining books of the year.
