Some delightful children's shorts have come to
DVD recently. One is the all-time AlbertLamorisse classic The Red Balloon,  a delicately
charming, wordless tale of a little boy followedaround the streets of Paris by a red balloon.Another is White Mane, director Lamorisse's firstgem, this one about a wild stallion and the boywho befriends him. Finally, there's Paddle ToThe Sea , a Canadian short based on the picture
book about a wooden canoe Indian which
manages to traverse much of the country in an unlikely journey shot over two years on location. Allare available from Janus Films via the exemplary crew at Criterion for $14.95 each, with basicallyno extras. Historically, The Red Balloon  and White Mane are paired together in movie theaters
since they're both 40 minutes or less. That's how I saw them at Film Forum recently and if you lastsaw Balloon as a little kid, you'll be delighted at how enthralling it remains. White Mane  is nearly
as good and a worthy precursor to The Black Stallion  in the "boy and his horse" genre. It's marred
only slightly by the fact that our hero, Folco, with his artfully torn clothes and pouty lips, looks farmore like a Dolce & Gabbana model than a poor fisherman. The surprise is that all three films arereleased on their own DVDs. As Criterion argues on their excellent blog,  White Mane  has always
been the B-side to The Red Balloon  and been overshadowed by that film for far too long. This
individual release is meant to let it stand on its own. Consider that the wrong decision made for theright reason. White Mane  is indeed an absolute pleasure, but the simple fact is that it will be
bought and seen far less when sold on its own than when it's paired with Balloon . Better to be
second fiddle than ignored completely. Frankly, all three films should have been on one DVD, sincePaddle To The Sea is markedly inferior, albeit not without interest for the very young. All on onedisc, they'd total 102 minutes and make a fine triple bill. By all means, don't miss White Mane.And skip the English narration track -- almost the entire narration is unnecessary (not to mentiona bit melodramatic) and it's far less distracting in French with English subtitles. Don't worry --

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: The Red Balloon Vs. White Mane
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-emthe-red-balloonem_b_100452.html [4/5/2009 7:02:31 PM]your kids will be able to follow the story just fine, even if they don't read the subtitles. Finally, I've
avoided the re-imagining of Red Balloon as the feature length French film Voyage of the RedBalloon by Hsiao-Hsien Hou and starrng Juliette Binoche because it seemed like such an awful
idea. Why mess with perfection? But friends have told me that it's really quite different and not anexpanded remake and well done, so now I'm ready to check it out.
Also out this week: The Golden Compass  ($28.98; New Line), which has the right production
design, the right cast (especially Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter), the right special effects, the right
inspiration (Philip Pullman's brilliant books) -- pretty much everything except a touch of magic tomake it come alive; I'm Not There  ($29.99; Weinstein/Genius) is a shaggy Dylan-esque mess but
there's sure to be some storyline that appeals -- I like the little black boy Dylan and of course CateBlanchett and the soundtrack is seriously entertaining;  The Diving Bell and the Butterfly ($29.99;
Miramax), is a beautiful, sexy gem that is far too entertaining to label "inspirational" but it's thattoo, thanks to a brilliant performance by Mathieu Amalric; The Films of Morris Engel ($39.95;
Kino), is a great peek at New York City in the Fifites thanks to three cinema verite trifles led by the
minor classic Little Fugitive  (1953) (about a little boy running away to Coney Island) and followed
by two similar films that glimpse the city in unadorned delight via wafer-thin storylines; The
Adventures of Young Indiana Jones Volume Three ($129.99; Paramount) concludes the TV series
in fine fashion with Sean Patrick Flanery making the most of young Indy (he's truly winning) and
George Lucas making good on his pledge to educate and entertain by including more than two
dozen quite substantial documentaries about the historical events Indy dashes through; the
acclaimed Bollywood musical Saawariya  ($26.96; Columbia TriStar) is as good an introduction as
any to that wonderfully over-the-top genre; Sense & Sensibilty  ($34.98; BBC Video) and My Boy
Jack  ($19.98; BBC Video) with Sense  needing three hours to convince me there was a need to
revisit the tale told to perfection by Emma Thompson and Ang Lee and Daniel Radcliffe using the
story of Kipling's doomed son to make his claim for a post-Harry Potter career more likely every
day; 2007 Academy Award Short Films ($29.98; Magnolia), which contains eight shorts (five live
action and three animated) including the two winners; Disney's foray south of the border Saludos
Amigos  and The Three Caballeros  on one disc ($19.99; Disney), a venture which has gone from
being considered welcome to vaguely stereotyped to appreciated for the sympathetic if superficial
effort it was; The Living End  ($27.99; Strand), Gregg Araki's breakthrough which led to his
masterpiece Mysterious Skin; Twister ($20.98; Warner Bros.), the Jan de Bont nature attacks
thriller that seemed dated the moment it came out (were we really that excited by flying cattle?);Beverly Hills 90210 Fourth Season  ($59.98; Paramount), the crucial year when they headed to
college rather than trying to pretend Jason Priestly, Luke Perry et al were eternal teenagers and
giving the show true legs; Abel Raises Cain ($20 plus $5 shipping) a documentary about thelegendary media con artist Alan Abel directed by Jenny Abel & Jeff Hockett and currently availableonly through their website ; Bernard and Doris ($26.98; HBO), with Susan Sarandon and Ralph
Fiennes sparking each other as the billionaire Doris Duke and her gay butler Bernard Lafferty; theabove average sword and sandals epic The Fall Of The Roman Empire  ($24.95; Weinstein/Genius)
whose superior cast (Alec Guinness, James Mason, etc) keeps it from taking place in real time, theway you might fear; The Waltons Seventh Season  ($39.98; Warner Bros.) in which niceness takes a
beating thanks to tuberculosis and Pearl Harbor among other tragedies; Cheers Ninth Season($39.98; Paramount) and an sitcom lasting this long is happy to produce the occasional chuckle,which this one does; The British Empire In Color  ($24.99; Acorn), reveals a remarkable amount of
color footage that can detail the Empire's last days; Military Intelligence and You  ($14.99; Echo
Bridge), a mockumentary that does its best to trump the black-humored absurdity in governmentthat prevails today; Speed Racer The Next Generation: The Beginning ($19.98; LionsGate), thepilot for the cartoon spin-off from the new movie; Che Guevara: Hasta La Victoria Siempre($19.99; Kultur), a 66 minute documentary from 1999 with archival footage hoping to gain moreattention in the wake of the new Steven Soderbergh movies about Ernesto; African American Lives2 ($24.99; PBS), Roots  comes to life with this intriguing series hosted by Henry Louis Gates Jr.
featuring Maya Angelou, Tina Turner, Chris Rock and others; Nanking  ($27.98; Think Film), a
formally bold (or is that foolish?) docu-drama of sorts about the rape of Nanking and the crucialrole of some Westerners in helping to save thousands; Senior Skip Day  ($24.98; First Look), a
comedy which leaves maybe only gym class and the science fair as unexplored high school rites ofpassage); and finally The BBC Natural History Collection ($199.98; BBC Video), a tremendous 17disc collection that includes The Life of Birds, The Life of Mammals, Planet Earth and my personalfavorite Blue Planet,  four documentaries that are exceptionally entertaining and visually stunning.
So, do you remember seeing The Red Balloon  as a child (grade school teachers loved to kill 40
