Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: Fans of classic toy stories like Winnie-the-Pooh  by
A. A. Milne, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane  by Kate
DiCamillo, and Toys Go Out  by Emily Jenkins will love this illustrated
novel  by Newbery Medalist Cynthia Voigt.
Winner of a Parents Choice Silver Honor Award   
Teddy is a thinking kind of bear. Of all his friends, he does the most
wondering. He lives with a ragtag group of lost toys—a very hungry snake,an elephant who likes to bake, two charmingly silly pigs, and a reclusivepenguin—and they all bump along happily together. But their peaceful
world gets shaken up when new  toys arrive—first a rabbit, who is not as
soft and floppy as he looks, and then a beautiful doll with royal ambitions.
Will the newcomers learn to fit into the community? Or will thecommunity be forever changed by them?…

What We Say
Cynthia Voigt's latest book is a gentle bit of whimsy. On a small island, a group of disparate toys live together in familial
harmony -- which is to say they bicker and fight but everyone pretty much gets along. Teddy is a legless teddy bear hauledaround on a red wagon by his roomie Umpah, an elephant. Pia and Prinny are pigs, with Pia always clutching an ice cream
cone and Prinny rather adorably little kid-ish, always bursting out with questions and exclamations like when she learns to
swim. ("I'm swimming! Am I swimming?") Peng the penguin lives grumpily alone while Sid the snake is always hungry. Luckilyfor him, Umpah is an excellent baker and always has a tray of muffins in the oven. Their lives are interrupted byShare This Book

<p>newcomers and rain and the like and it's all quietly entertaining. This isn't quite the instant classic lovers of "Winnie The
Pooh" might hope for, given Voigt's track record. But it's disarming on its own terms and a pleasant addition to the author's
shelf. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
PRAISE FOR Teddy & Co. :
"Voigt's writing remains masterful, and her attention continues to be on what makes a family, how we can live
together in harmony, and how individuals overcome their difficulties." -- Kirkus Reviews
"An affirming celebration of friendship, kindness, and embracing new experiences and relationships." -
-Publishers Weekly
"This work has a classic sensibility, reminiscent of Winnie-the-Pooh. A great option for one-on-one bedtime
read-alouds." -- School Library Journal
"Voigt, who has won many fans with the Tillerman Cycle  and the Mister Max  series, shows that she can write for
a younger audience with simplicity, clarity, and subtlety."  --Booklist
“I love finding new early chapter books that treat young readers with respect. I can picture  Teddy & Co.  being
read aloud by a family together or stealthily under the covers by one kid with a flashlight. Each lightly
illustrated chapter functions well as its own short story and as a piece of the narrative whole. These are lovable
and unique characters that will charm parents and children alike.”…
