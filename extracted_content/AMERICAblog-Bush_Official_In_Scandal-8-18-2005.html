8/18/2005 06:21:00 PMYep, yet another Bush appointee fails in his job and is rewardedwith a promotion. The latest is Pentagon official MichaelWynne, who was involved in a scandal that has put two peoplebehind bars. (Wynne himself lied to the White House budgetoffice.) Bush wants Wynne to head the Air Force, which needs anew head because the LAST nominee had his own string ofscandals and couldn't get confirmed. My favorite detail aboutthe scandal, which involved leasing jets from Boeing forrefueling:The former Air Force official, Darleen Druyun, is serving anine-month term at a federal prison in Florida. Sheadmitted inflating the lease price as a "parting gift"to Boeing before leaving the Pentagon for a job at theaircraft giant in 2002.A "parting gift?" What is this, "The Price Is Right?" How aboutcreating a new reality show where someone tries to get fired byBush? It could run for years, obviously, since even harming nationalsecurity and outing a covert agent during war is fine by Bush.
