DVDs: What Actor Should Play
Obama?

You know it's coming. Whatever happens in
November, a TV movie and/or feature film aboutthe life of Barack Obama will be made. So whoshould play Obama? The Daily Show  -- in a
mock biography of Obama  -- suggested one of the
actors from the old sitcom What's Happening?Other possibilities: Dule Hill from The WestWing  and Psych ; Tristan Wilds from 90210  and
The Wire;  or the great Adrian Lester from
Primary Colors.  What do you think?
And while you're thinking, check out some politically themed DVDs out the last two weeks. (Hey, Iwas caught up in the Olympics and the convention, so I've got catching up to do.) AmericanExperience: The Presidents  ($129.98; PBS/Paramount), an excellent boxed set pulling together 10
documentaries on 20th century Presidents, from Teddy Roosevelt and FDR to Reagan and Bush Sr.Sober, thoughtful, documentaries, they make absorbing viewing. In contrast, the BiographyChannel has put out Biography: John McCain  and Biography: Barack Obama  ($12.95 each;
A&E), both of which are less than an hour, perfunctory and far less insightful. Anyone expectingmuckraking from director Oliver Stone's upcoming biopic on Bush Jr. -- W , due out in October --
should check out Nixon , just out in an extended cut with 28 extra minutes ($29.99 and $34.99 on
BluRay; Hollywood). Anthony Hopkins was a bold choice and the movie is far more complex andempathetic than you might expect. (I would prefer they include the original cut as well, of course;people shouldn't have to choose.) W  will probably be the same. Of course, if you do want
muckraking, there's always Robert Greenwald, who makes shoddy, haphazard documentaries likeThe Real John McCain  ($9.95; Disinformation). Whatever your politics, shouldn't his
documentaries look more polished than something a high school student might have tossedtogether and posted on YouTube? It does provide good red meat for the already convinced. If youwant to get riled up, try Recount  ($19.98; HBO), HBO's comic look at the Florida recount in 2000
with an all-star cast having a hoot, led by Kevin Spacey, Laura Dern and Tom Wilkinson. Morgan

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Actor Should Play Obama?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-actor-should-pl_b_122509.html [4/5/2009 1:38:59 PM]Spurlock has had success with Super Size Me and his clever TV show, but flounders a bit when
trying to step into the shoes of Michael Moore on Where In The World Is Osama Bin Laden?
($24.95; Genius), a comic journey around the world with Spurlock asking anyone and everyone if
they know where Bin Laden is hiding? (Spoiler: the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan
is an awfully popular choice.) Spurlock's wife deserves a medal for letting him galivant around the
world while she's pregnant and he does try to stretch himself, but it basically makes you appreciate
how good Moore is at what he does. Linda Lovelace was good at what she does, too, but she wasn't
very happy about it. Nonetheless, one of the artifacts of her fame is  Linda Lovelace For President
($14.98; Dark Sky), a 1975 B-movie about Lovelace hoping to "go down" (their words) as the first
female President. It drags in everyone from Scatman Crothers to Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees to
little purpose. For politics of the past, Chicago 10  ($29.98; Paramount) is a genre-bending
animated movie about the trial surrounding the '68 Chicago Convention that went a lot less
smoothly than Obama's in Denver. Finally, House Season Four  ($59.98; Universal) woke up a
show slipping into formula with an election of its own as House put a passel of candidates through
their paces while he decided on a new team.
Other DVDs now out:
Action/Adventure Flicks:  In Street Kings  ($29.99; Fox), Keanue Reeves delivers his patented,
stolid performance as a detective who finds himself betrayed and facing violence on all sides. It'll
play better on DVD than in theaters -- and like more and more titles, this one comes with a freedigital copy you can download to watch on your computer or iPod. Starship Troopers 3: Marauder($27.96; Sony) is another direct to DVD sequel to the underappreciated Verhoeven sci-fi satire,with Casper Van Dien back as Johnny Rico and a lot of bugs, it's for hardcore fans only and alsocomes with a free digital copy to download. Brotherhood of the Wolf Director's Cut  ($19.98;
Universal), an overheated French costume action flick that proved they could make boneheadedgoofy action flicks just like the US (and of course, it's longer and padded with hours of extras). Ifyou're looking forward to the new Nicolas Cage action movie, check out the lovably over-the-topPang Brothers original it's based on: Bangkok Dangerous  ($9.98; First Look). More direct to DVD
action arrives with The Scorpion King 2: Rise Of A Warrior ($29.98; Universal) in which RandyCouture plays the young warrior who will one day morph into Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson andhow sad to see it's directed by the talented Russell Mulcahy. Steve McQueen knows action and cooland proved it on the way to becoming a star in Never Love A Stranger  ($14.98; Republic) one of
those standard tales of two boyhood pals where one becomes a cop and the other a criminal. AndTony Jaa of Ong-Bak  is the hero of these B-movie action flicks about a bodyguard and called,
reasonably enough, The Bodyguard and The Bodyguard 2 (both movies on one DVD ($26.98;
Magnet) and no Whitney Houston does not sing the theme song.
Family Movies:  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas Collector's Edition  ($32.99;
Disney) looks better with each passing year -- and in this case it's because they've sharpened the
striking look of the film to match Burton's original vision closer than ever and you also get a digitalcopy for your computer and iPod and loads of extras. It's a genuine classic. Stephen Chow is anenjoyably wacky director but his cuddly alien movie CJ7  ($28.96; Columbia) is a little too
sentimental and family-ish. He made better family entertainment when he wasn't trying, as withShaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle.  Chevy Chase certainly didn't intend to make family films but I
think his goofy Fletch movies as collected in The Fletch Collection  ($19.98; Universal) are perfect
for older kids and parents to watch together -- kids love disguises they can see through and Fletchhas a million of 'em. Transformers Animated: Season One  ($26.98; Paramount) contains MOST
of the episodes from Season One (you need to buy another DVD to get the other three) and it'sONLY in cropped, full frame when the show is also available in widescreen -- why not make bothversions available in one set and make it complete? Bakugan Battle Brawlers Vol. 1  ($14.98;
Warner Bros.) contains five episodes from a new animated series I haven't caught up with yet.Much gentler -- and clearly for younger kids -- are three other releases: Where The Wild Things Are($14.95; New Video) contains six Maurice Sendak tales read by Peter Schickele and others; Bob TheBuilder On Site: Houses & Playgrounds  ($19.98; Lionsgate) mixes animation with real-life
construction sites because kids LOVE giant dump trucks; and Curious George Sails With ThePirates  ($16.98; Universal) contains eight episodes from the PBS series with George all over the
place but mostly -- I like to think -- trying to get away from the Man in the Yellow Hat, who isalways giving George up to other people. And kids can rock out to Hannah Montana and MileyCyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert and Camp Rock  ($34.99 each on Blu-Ray or $29.99 on
regular DVD; Disney), both of which -- OMG -- feature the Jonas Brothers and with the HannahMontana movie even includes four sets of glasses so you can watch it in 3-D.

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: What Actor Should Play Obama?
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-what-actor-should-pl_b_122509.html [4/5/2009 1:38:59 PM]Boneheaded Moves:  Son of Rambow  ($19.99; Paramount) is an oddball family film that got
overlooked when it was released in theaters. The story of a kid who befriends a bully by shooting a
home movie inspired by Rambo: First Blood Part 2  was never gonna be a blockbuster. But it got
some friendly reviews and might have found an audience on DVD. But you can only buy it at BestBuy (although you can rent it everywhere). I really hate these exclusive deals; they're not good forthe movies and they're certainly not good for fans. Even people who like the movie probably won'trealize it's been released on DVD.
Light Entertainment:  Is Ashton Kutcher a star? He keeps piling up the anonymous hits, like
What Happens In Vegas  with Cameron Diaz ($29.98; Fox) and eventually he'll start getting credit
for them. (This is ANOTHER movie that provides a free digital copy you can watch on your
computer and iPod and so on; hopefully soon this will become so standard it won't be worth
mentioning. Is Ed Burns a bankable director? He keeps making commercial flops like Purple
Violets  ($19.98; Weinstein) that costars Debra Messing, Selma Blair and Patrick Wilson that come
and go in the blink of an eye. Are The Three Stooges funny? Check out The Three Stooges
Collection Volume Three  ($24.96; Sony) and if you like slapstick these shorts will make you say
yes. (And if you want to know if someone is gay, ask them if they like The Three Stooges or show
them one of these shorts -- gay people just don't get 'em.) Is Mischa Barton naked? The Three
Musketeers-style costumer romp Virgin Territory ($26.97; Anchor Bay) stars Hayden Christensen
and Mischa Barton and has a sticker on it with silhouetted strippers that says it's part of the
Anchor Bay "Unzipped" collection. That'll get some people renting it and skipping through the flick
to find the naughty bits. And when will someone make a new feature film out of The Lone Ranger?
The 1981 flop The Legend of the Lone Ranger  ($14.98; Lionsgate) was stillborn, but boy did they
find an unknown with a classic 50s movie star name: Klinton Spilsbury. It won't be long before
someone remakes it again.
Serious Entertainment : Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis  ($29.95; Art House Films)
is an acclaimed documentary about the New York photographer and performance artist who
inspired Warhol; Twenty-Four Eyes  ($29.95; Criterion) is a beloved Japanese film about a
schoolteacher, sort of their Goodbye Mr. Chips;  Vera Farmiga continues to impress in Quid Pro
Quo  ($26.98; Magnolia), an indie flick co-starring the equally impressive Nick Stahl in this
disturbing look at a subculture of people turned on by missing limbs -- a natural double bill withCronenberg's Crash ; but it's still not as disturbing as Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo, or 120 Days of
Sodom  ($39.95; Criterion), which revels in the torture and degradation of Fascist Italy and I've
never been abe to get through it, which is probably a recommendation to some; Miss PettigrewLives For A Day ($29.98; Universal) doesn't quite capture the screwball charm of the comic novelbut it's an enjoyable bit of fluff about a dour woman caught up in high society and FrancesMcDormand and Amy Adams clearly have a ball; the Academy Award winner for Best ForeignFilm, The Countefeiters  ($28.96; Sony Pictures Classics) tells the fascinating true story of a con
man who finds himself helping the Nazis produce fake money to fund the war just so he can avoidbeing killed; the marvelous black comedy Delicatessen  ($19.98; Lionsgate) in a new special edition
of the story of a deli that can rival the one in Sweeney Todd  for delicious meats; Karim Ainouz
proves he's a director to watch by following the vibrant Madame Sata  with Love For Sale  ($27.97;
Strand), another compelling drama about people on the boundaries of society; AKA Tommy Chong($24.98; Infinity) is a documentary that deftly exposes the absurdity of prosecuting someone likeChong in the war on drugs; David Mamet explores the fight world in Redbelt  ($27.96; Sony
Pictures Classics) with Chiwetel Ejiofor typically imposing as a martial arts expert forced to stepinto the ring and fight for the first time; The Life Before Her Eyes  ($26.98; Magnolia) was a blink
and you missed it followup to the Oscar-nominated House of Sand and Fog,  but star Evan Rachel
Wood is clearly an astonishing young actress; and there's a mini Michael Powell festival thanks tothe release of Classic British Thrillers  ($24.98; MPI), which has three fine movies on one disc,
including two early ventures by the great Powell and then The Small Back Room  ($39.95;
Criterion), a lesser known Powell-Pressburger drama presented with the usual care of Criterion.
TV On DVD:  It never ends, the wave of TV product coming to DVD. Gossip Girl First Season
($59.98; Warner Bros.) is a guilty pleasure of a soap and if the show were half as clever as the ad
campaign promoting its second season it would rank as one of the best shows on TV instead of justone of the most-discussed. (Bonus points for including an audiobook reading of the novelperformed by Christina Ricci.) Alfresco  ($39.99; Acorn) was a UK sketch show with a brilliant cast
that could give early SNL  a run for its money -- getting their big breaks were Emma Thompson,

Rocket LaunchHugh Laurie, Robbie Coltrane, Stephen Fry and Ben Elton. Heroes Season 2  ($39.98; Universal)
was fun though they admit it took too long to get going. Me, I think the biggest problem is on-
going storylines -- each season should have a clear villain with all the heroes coming together to
defeat the baddie for good at the finale. An American Crime  ($24.98; First Look) is the harrowing,
Emmy nominated TV movie about a woman (Catherine Keener) who imprisons and tortures a
teenage girl (Ellen Page of Juno ), which sounds unbearable but is given a compeling humanity by
two terrific actresses. The Duchess of Duke Street Complete Collection  ($99.99; Acorn) contains all
31 episodes of the beloved UK series about a scullery maid who becomes the best chef in London.Entourage Fourth Season  ($39.98; HBO) may revel in Hollywood and Cannes but the show works
not because of its satire but because of the genuine friendships at its core. Everybody Hates Chris
Third Season ($39.98; Paramount) is running out of steam, but what a great cast, from TichinaArnold and Terry Crews (both of whom long ago deserved Emmy nominations) to the assuredTyler James Williams as Chris Rock. One Tree Hill Fifth Season  ($59.98; Warner Bros.) was the
year the show took a bold leap and jumped nearly five years into the future; even better so does thisset by providing digital copies of every episode so you can watch them on your laptop or iPod --certainly one of if not the first TV set to do so. Dexter Second Season  ($39.98; Paramount) has to
be one of the unlikeliest TV shows ever (a series about a serial killer?) and a genuine triumph forMichael C. Hall. Get ready for the seventh and final season of The Shield  by diving into Season 6
($59.95; Sony), which is a little pricey for a 10 episode show but gripping nonetheless.  John
Oliver's Terrifying Times  ($19.99; Paramount) is a TV special that further proves he is the next
Daily Show  star destined to have his own show while Dana Carvey's Squatting Monkeys Tell No
Lies ($19.98; HBO) makes you wonder how he became famous in the first place. Crime doesn't pay
when The Untouchables Season 2 Volume 2  ($39.98; Paramount) are there to bust you and Perry
Mason Season 3 Volume 1 ($39.98; Paramount) is there to put you behind bars. And The ColorHoneymooners Collection 4  ($39.98; MPI) is the final batch of Honeymooner sketches from the
Jackie Gleason variety show that came at the tail end of his career.
Etc.  Wimbledon: The 2008 Men's Final ($24.99; SRO) contains the entire five hour battle between
Federer and Nadal that is easily one of the greatest tennis matches of all time. Country fans can
revel in the rarities on Legendary Performances Tammy Wynette  and Legendary Performances
Marty Robbins  ($14.98 each; Shout) that pull together rare TV footage to showcase 15 songs each,
as well as short interviews and their Hall of Fame introductions; fans should snap them up. TheGreat American Bash 2008  ($24.95; WWE) features all star wrestlers in all sorts of matchups --
my favorite is John Cena and JBL in a "NYC Parking Lot Brawl." Finally, I'm too much of a wimpto watch horror movies, so you'll have to tell me how Brittany Snow is in the remake of PromNight  ($28.96; Sony), whether terror runs deep as they claim for Skinned Alive  ($26.98;
Lionsgate) and if 6 Films To Keep You Awake  ($27.98; Lionsgate) really does cause sleepless
nights with flicks like Spectre  and A Christmas Tale.
So, any thoughts? Who should play Barack Obama in the inevitable miniseries/feature film? You
can always go with Daniel Day Lewis -- he can play anyone.
