            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J U LY  1 7 ,  2 0 0 6How Could They Cancel "Deadwood?"I just realized HBO probably saw all (or almost all) of the new season of"Deadwood" when they decided to cancel it. That makes their decisionall the more infuriating. "Deadwood" has been better than ever, with abreakout performance by Gerald McRaney that is as gripping as IanMcShane's original appearance as Swearengen. (And how funny is itthat Swearengen now seems like a reasonable guy?) HBO kept "Arliss"on the air for years because they knew a core group of fans were happyto pay for HBO 12 months a year just to see those new episodes."Deadwood" surely achieves the same purpose, not to mention the auraof being a critics' darling that makes HBO the place to be. Last night'sepisode was a corker and I can't wait for the rest. I almost wish theyhadn't agreed to do those final four hours -- any attempt to tie up thestorylines will seem rushed and unnecessary compared to the hilarious,profane heights the show is currently scaling. Oh and I finally enjoyed"Entourage" last night for the first time. Either it's growing on me orthey just got lucky for once. (I'm pretty sure it wasn't because of thethreesome.)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
