THEATER: Good Intentions No Substitute For
Good Melodies In "Broadbend, Arkansas"
BROADBEND,  ARKANSAS  ** out of ****
TRANSPORT  GROUP   AT DUKE  ON  42ND  STREET
Good intentions do not a good musical make. Composer Ted Shen's
heart is in the right place with this odd duck of a two-hander show. InAct One, nursing home orderly Benny narrates an on-going feudbetween two women at his place of work in 1961. Then this widowed
father of twins feels compelled to join the Freedom Riders fighting for
justice in the deep South. He shadows a bus filled with a rainbow ofprotestors, protects a friend when the police move in, gets proudlyarrested and finally heads back home though he'd love to ride on thatbus to the next town.
In Act Two, it's 1988 and the struggle continues. Benny's daughter
Ruby is in a cemetery looking for the strength to carry on. We soonrealize Benny was killed by a policeman just miles from home. Andnow his grandson is in the hospital after being brutally beaten by yet
another lawless cop. For all we know, that cop might be the grandson
of Benny's murderer. Will it ever end?
The stage is filled by just two actors and they are far and away the best
and only reason to check out this piece. As Benny Justin Cunningham
fills the stage with his warmth and presence, even if the elderly women
he briefly assays aren't terribly distinct in our minds. As Ruby, DanyelFulton has the less interesting half yet she too brings complexity andpassion to a part that offers little of that on its own.
Sadly, they are not enough. The tech elements are minimal but even
those go astray. Lighting cues by Jen Schriever don't clearly indicatewhen Cunningham is tackling a different character, though sometimesthey seem to do so. The costumes by Peiyi Wong don't seem periodenough. And director Jack Cummings III doesn't mold all this together
to give the two actors the support they need and deserve.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

BOOKS: Is Finance The Root Of
All Evil?</p>

But it all begins with this essay/history lesson disguised as a work of
theater. Though the two acts are intimately connected, the first act iswritten by Ellen Fitzhugh and the second by Harrison David Rivers.The music and additional lyrics are by Ted Shen.
Curiously, about half of act one involves that feud between two
women. One is the owner of the nursing home while the other is a
patient. They bicker and fight over a game of Scrabble. But really theirfight is over the man they shared: the patient's husband left her for themuch younger owner of the nursing home, but not before the wife
wounded him with a steaming hot iron. Benny claims to be refereeing
the two women and making peace but really he's just narrating theirstory. Cunningham doesn't create two distinct women but that's partlythe fault of Fitzhugh since their voices tend to blur together. Abruptlythis ends and Benny goes off on his civil rights crusade.
The big problem? The feuding old biddies are by far the most
interesting and fresh part of the musical. Their story feels like a story,not a noble speech dressed up as a story. And yet, they have nothing todo with the rest of the evening. Half of act one is devoted to this
essentially separate tale and then switches over to civil rights. I
suppose you could pretend they make peace and so can blacks andwhites, but that's quite the stretch.
The other half of act one flows right into the story of Ruby, the
daughter of Benny. here actress Fulton has far fewer roles to tackle.
It's essentially a monologue and not a particularly fresh or interestingone. Worst of all, the presentation glides back and forth betweendialogue and music. Shen seems wary of anything approaching anactual song or memorable melody. Part 5 of "The Bridge" sticks briefly
in the mind as Benny sings about how "It's such a comfort to take the
bus." And Ruby comes briefly to life via song when she remembers hertwin sister telling anyone who would listen that their mom was abackup singer for Diana Ross.THEATER: Good Intentions No

<p>That's it. The rest is sincere, principled, polite, sometimes politely
righteous and even angry! But always, always forgettable. I can't figureout why the story of two feuding old ladies takes up half of act one. Icertainly know all why they wanted to illuminate the bravery of the
Freedom Riders and show how that struggle goes on. (Act Three might
easily have jumped to Black Lives Matter.) But whether you're creatinga musical about shopping or slavery, you better have the songs. AsDuke Ellington and Irving Mills put it, it don't mean a thing.... See, youknew how to finish the lyrics ("...if it ain't got that swing") without me
telling you. High art should not mean a disdain for the low appeal of a
catchy tune.
