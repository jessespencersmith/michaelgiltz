He wanted to read more, so I pickedup two pbs of "Silas Marner" -- the story of a hermit-like weaver whobecomes obsessed with gold until its stolen and "replaced" by anorphaned little girl. Just finished mine and while certainly not asmagisterial as "Middlemarch," it's sharp and delightful in a simplerway. Could easily be filmed with too much sentimentality (the waypeople ruin "Our Town"), but to my surprise this "heartwarming" storyhas rarely been tackled. A few silent versions, a 6 part British TVversion in the 60s and Ben Kingsley hot off "Gandhi" in 1985. Wouldlove to check that one out. *** 1/2 (3.5 out of 4)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
