3/24/2005 02:06:00 AMHere's another point about the annual report on Social Securityand Medicare, the one that said Medicare is in much worseshape (ignore that, says Bush) and that some of the warningdates for SS have moved up a year (meaningless when you'reprojecting decades ahead, say most experts).One item in the New York Times:"To pay all scheduled benefits over the next 75 years, thegovernment would have to raise an additional $4 trillion intoday's dollars, $300 billion higher than the figure projectedlast year."You mean, if we simply chose not to make permanent those taxcuts for the super rich -- the ones Bush enacted because heinsisted we would have such a massive surplus in our budget itwould be downright dangerous -- that this ALONE wouldprovide enough money to shore up SS for the next 75 yearswithout ANY other changes? With money to spare? Gee,choosing between an unnecessary windfall for people making$300,000 a year and more versus ensuring that old peopledon't go hungry is a really tough choice.I guess when Greenspan said fixing SS really wasn't that hard,he knew what he was talking about. Mind you, I don't thinkspiking those windfalls for the super rich is all that should bedone -- modest changes in SS are perfectly reasonableadjustments to make (such as raising the retirement age whenfull benefits kick in two years since people live so muchlonger).And of course some of that money is needed for Medicare. Butlet's pick our priorities. Very recent windfalls for the super-richof focusing on the health and minimal needs of the elderly?Gee, what would Jesus do?
