9/07/2005 11:15:00 AMThe NY Post can't quite bring itself to criticize Bush toostrongly, but even they realize FEMA's Michael Brown is grosslyincompetent and has caused the unnecessary death ofAmericans. The front page story? "Dead Wait," with the insidearticle headlined "FEMA Fool Sat On His Hands." Even an Op-Edcolumn by Ralph Peters in the NY Post on Tuesday that tries todefend Bush and denounce "playing politics" can't resistblasting the buffoons in charge:The Bush administration seems to have a problemwith serious planning outside of a campaign. Ourtroops were sent into Iraq without an occupation plan andnow we find that, four years after 9/11, the Department ofHomeland Security, which swallowed the FederalEmergency Management Agency, appears to have done noserious planning for a national disaster.What on earth has DHS been doing...?What's striking is that the administration and thestaffers at Homeland Security didn't seem to grasp allthe resources available to them -- or even what theirresponsibilities were. Anything but reassuring, theclumsy initial response to Katrina must have Islamistterrorists stroking their beards, smiling and thinkingahead....And furious over Europe's sometimes callous attitude towards thisdisaster, he blasts their leadership for an unforgivable dereliction ofduty:When the last water recedes, we may find that a fewthousand Americans died in a great natural catastrophe.But two years ago, during a heat-wave, 25,000 elderlyEuropeans died unnecessarily in France, Italy and Germanywhile their political leaders, medical personnel andeven their children went on vacation -- and stayed onvacation.I agree: leaders of countries who stay on vacation duringunprecedented national disasters are beyond contempt.
