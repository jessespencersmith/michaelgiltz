            <p>F R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 3 ,  2 0 0 6Why Everyone Is Wrong About The Oscars ShowThe New York Times, The New York Post, the LA Times, USA Today --everyone agrees that the Oscars show is in danger of being irrelevantbecause of the nominees. And they're all wrong. Here are the mythsabout the Oscars:1. It's dominated by tiny little independent films.2. People don't care about the movies nominated because they haven'tseen them.3. Ratings will drop because there are no blockbusters nominated.4. Brokeback Mountain is controversial.Let's tackle #1: the Big Nominees are "independent films." Of course,the term "independent film" is almost meaningless. Budget is not agood measuring stick and neither is the studio distributing it. All thatreally matters are the stars. So of the five Best Picture nominees --Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Crash, Good Night and Good Luck andMunich -- I'd say only Capote is an independent film in the classicsense. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a recognizable name to afficionadosand Catherine Keener just co-starred in the blockbuster The 40 YearOld Virgin, but no one in the movie opens films and they're morebeloved by critics than known by moviegoers. Frankly, Munich with its$70 million budget and low-key cast is as much of an independent filmas any of them. But of course it's directed by the most popular moviedirector in the world.But Brokeback Mountain? Please. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaalhave starred in a string of high profile movies and appeared incountless interviews and gossip magazines even before this filmexploded. And Michelle Williams starred in one of the iconic TV showsof the 90s (Dawson's Creek). This is not a no-name movie withunknown actors.Crash? This LA drama is practically like MGM -- it has more stars thanthere are in heaven. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon,Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillipe, Jennifer Esposito, Laurenz Tate -- it's ahuge, diverse, recognizable cast that can appeal to every minority groupthere is. It was also the year's biggest word of mouth hit -- $50 millionNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
