            <p>M O N D AY,  A P R I L  1 0 ,  2 0 0 6"Brokeback Mountain": Wal-Mart Says Yes,Prisons Say NoBrokeback Mountain continues to make news. The New York Timesreports that the lovable American Family Association is calling for aboycott of Wal-Mart over Brokeback Mountain. To show how weak theAFA has become, they're not even trying to stop Wal-Mart fromcarrying the DVD. No, what they object to is the fact that Wal-Mart hasput posters promoting the DVD in the front of its stores "wherechildren can see them." The AFA spokesperson also says since hedoesn't consider the movie a blockbuster that Wal-mart's agenda mustbe to "normalize" homosexuality. Wal-Mart is ignoring them, which isnice. But how sad they can't even pretend that anyone objects to themovie itself. All they want is Wal-Mart to take down those posters,because obviously any kid who sees Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledgeron a poster would turn gay or might forget to mock and belittle gay kidsat their school the next day. Meanwhile, Reuters reports a correctionalofficer in Massachusetts will be disciplined for showing Brokeback toinmates. They don't object to the content; they simply try to avoidmovies with sexually explicit scenes. I wonder if the prison also avoidsmovies with violence. I doubt it; but if they do, those prisoners musthave seen The Little Mermaid a thousand times by now.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Followup -- now Wal-Mart is pulling guns from a third of stores for"lack of demand." No guns AND they sell Brokeback Mountain? Whatis this world coming to?7:22 PM
