7/05/2005 03:50:00 PMHere's the latest on the insurgency's effective attacks onMuslim diplomats. They've kidnapped the Egyptian ambassadorand now attacked the reps of Bahrain and Pakistan. Pakistaneven refers to the "deteriorating security conditions" in Iraq.Didn't they get Bush's talking points? Anyone who thinks thiswill undercut support for the insurgency on the fabled Arabstreet forgets the very obvious point that the corrupt leaders ofPakistan et al are hated by Arabs almost as much as they hatethe US.And the good news? The Shiites and Kurds continue to reachout to the Sunnis, most recently by agreeing to accept some15 Sunnis onto the committee overseeing the drafting of theConstitution. This is significant since the Sunnis didn't"deserve" that membership since it boycotted the elections. Butthe Shiites and Kurds realize they must include the Sunnis ifthere's to be any long-term hope for peace. This comes on topof their tweaking of election procedures -- in the future,representatives will come from particular regions instead ofjust the top-vote getters nationally. This means Sunnis will getroughly proportional representation in the governing body nomatter how many of them go to the polls. Finally, the 15Sunnis were accepted even though some of them weresuspected of being Baathists. Quite pragmatic, they've been.Mr. Hamoudi, a prominent Shiite cleric, said thecommittee had decided it did not immediately matterthat the Sunnis had suspect political backgrounds. Itwas more important to have the Sunni point of viewaired during the writing of the constitution, he said.He added that the committee had sent the 15 namesto a commission responsible for keeping seniorBaathists out of the government, but that thecommission had yet to reply."If we were talking about ministries, names might bemore important," Mr. Hamoudi said at a newsconference. "But since it's a committee, having theviews is more important than the names."No matter how incompetent Bush has been in the execution of thiswar, no matter how deceptive the American people believe he's beenin getting us into the war, the Shiites and Kurds seem to be doingeverything they can in the worst possible situation to pull some goodout of this mess.
