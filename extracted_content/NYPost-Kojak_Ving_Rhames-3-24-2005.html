HIS is NOT your father's
"Koiak."
As played by the com-
manding Ving Rhames in the
new USA series (Friday night
at 9), Kojak is a cop who plays
by his own rules.
Kolak twists the laws so a
criminal behind bars can be re-
united with his kids.
Kojak turns a blind eye to vig-
ilante justice, but feels troubled
by his decision.
He has a chaste romantic re-
Iationship, isn't ashamed to cry
on the shoulder of his best
friend (played by ChazzFalm-
interi) and - in what may well
be a TV first - discretely
makes the sign of the cross
when leaving a gruesome crime
scene.
Is it any surprise to find out
that Rhames - who led a hard-
scrabble childhood with an ab-
sent father - felt destined to
put his stamp on this role?
Unfailingly polite, Rhames
doesn't suffer fools gladly.
Although "Kojak" hasn't de-buted yet, he already seems
bored by the inevitable ques-
tions about the lollipop (still
there), ti;e hat (sometimes) and
the catch pi:rase (tweaked for a
new millennium). That same
seriousness extends to his faith.
'I think quite a bit oforga-
nized religion has become big
business," says Rhames. "Jesus
Christ never solil the word of
God. He never gave a sermon
and then said, 'For $8.99, you
can buy the CD.'
"I try to base my life on the
pri r;iples of Christ. I try to
raise my family on the princi-
ples of Christ. I don't know if
that makes me religious,
"I'm a God-fearing man and I
know the only reason why I am
here going from pc,' .- ity to
where I am now is God has His
hand on my life. I tell people, I
didn't choose acting; God chose
me to act."
So expect Kojak to be princi-
pled but complicated, a good
man making hard decisions in a
world where prostitutes can be
murde ,'ed, and no one dares.
Expect a man who ci,n be scaryquestioning a criminal but a big
softie around kids - just like
Rhames.
"All I want and all I even ask
of people in Holll'wood is look,
just be honest with me. Please
don't lie to me. Whatever the
situation is, be honest with me.
I think a lot of that part of mypersonality will come out in
this Kojak," he says.
"He is a man who cares about
the death of hookers. the death
of anyone. But he's also a guy
who does somethins that one
has to question: DoSs the ends
justify the means? He's very
imperfect."Ving Rhames is making the tough New York detective, Kojak, his own.</p>
