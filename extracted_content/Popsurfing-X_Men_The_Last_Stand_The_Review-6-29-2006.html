            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  J U N E  2 9 ,  2 0 0 6"X-Men: The Last Stand" -- The ReviewSo sue me -- I'm just catching up with "X-Men," since I was away whenit opened. (Did I mention I was in Cannes?) I like the comic books a lot,but I haven't been a fan of the first two. The first was weak and thesecond was pretty good, but no more. With Brett Ratner at the helm, Ithought this would be a train wreck. But to my surprise, I liked it just asmuch if not more than "X2." The gay subtext was as strong as ever(thanks to the all-too-brief subplot with Angel), it moved along nicely(only 90 minutes) and there were actual deaths (though no one staysdead for long as anyone who stayed to the end found out in a kicker).On the negative side, why does Hollywood always think bad guy rebelsneed to dress like lame punk rockers (or more accurately, look like kidsdressing up as punk rockers for Halloween); it was awfully hard to buyKelsey Grammar as an action hero; and with all the gay subtext itwould be nice if at least one of the X-men could actually be gay. (Ithought for sure at least Magneto could come up with a juicy commentwhen Angel flew by.) But all in all, pretty fun. And to heck withWolverine -- let's give Ben Foster's Angel a spinoff pronto.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
