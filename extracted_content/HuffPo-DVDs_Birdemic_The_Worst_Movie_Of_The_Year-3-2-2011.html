<p>BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR  ($29.98 BluRay and $24.98 regular DVD; Severin) -- Okay,
enough blather about the best movies of the year. Let's talk about the worst movie of the year, a film that
some have bandied about as the worst of all time. Plan 9 From Outer Space  used to be the Citizen Kane
of bad movies. No one really questioned its preeminence. But today there's an almost unseemly rush formovies to be dubbed the worst of all time. Trolls 2  even has a documentary about how awful it is. Me, I'm
not a big fan of sitting through bad movies. I have to do that enough without having to actually seekthem out. But on a plane flight I sat next to a guy who found out what I did and asked if I'd heard ofBirdemic . It was, he assured me, the worst movie of all time and the director (and writer and
cinematographer and producer and executive producer James Nguyen had no idea. The guy's brother wasassociated with the film and I had to check it out. I politely said sure, with no real desire to do so. Even ifit was awfully bad, that didn't really interest me. I'm not into camp, though I laugh along with Showgirlsas much as the next guy. But then I saw Birdemic  was playing at IFC at a late night screening and a
friend was willing to go and what the heck.
Boy is it bad.
I'm not really laughing at any of the people involved. Laurence Olivier would look bad in this movie. I'm
not even laughing at Nguyen, really. They just made the best darn movie they could at the time. And it'shilariously bad precisely because they did their best. A movie that just tries to be dumb is no fun. It onlyworks if you can feel their desire. Birdemic  is about 45 minutes of extremely slow, poorly acted
exposition which has a weird fascination all its own. And the whole experience is worth it for the abruptcut from idyllic smalltown life to the sudden frenzied attack of the birds, attacks which are depicted withsuch low-budget cheapness and unexplained suddenness that I was convulsed with laughter. Seriously, ascene of absolutely no danger to dive-bombing mutant birds -- it's head-spinning in its abruptness. Theactors are good sports in their commentary while Nguyen keeps comparing his movie to AlfredHitchcock's The Birds.  Even a second viewing had me laughing more than I expected. If bad movies are
your thing, this is a keeper, loaded with some fine, self-deluding extras. God bless 'em for doing theirbest. That's the only reason it's any fun at all.
UNSTOPPABLE  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; FOX) -- This is a nice trim B movie (with an
A-list cast and budget, of course) about a runaway train. You get everything you want: a trim 98 minute

<p>running time, just enough background to make the characters interesting (Denzel Washington is a
widowed dad, Chris Pine is on the outs with his wife, Rosario Dawson is good at her job), and a runawaytrain that could level a small city thanks to its explosive cargo. Director Tony Scott delivers the goodswith economy and precision and certainly knows how to jazz up the excitement. Happily, they don't goover the top on the stunts. It all feels pretty realistic, with a little stretching because hey, it's a movie.Really, if you've seen it once, there's no need to see it again. But if more Hollywood films exhibited this
much restraint and focus, going to the theater would be a lot more fun more often.
AMARCORD  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- I've always had reservations about Federico Fellini. Maybe
because his movies are so distinctively Fellini-esque; maybe because my first exposure was to his weaker
later work? In any case, I have to admit that the number of Fellini movies I love continues to grow andAmarcord is right up there with his best. It's a warm, loving look at life in the small town where he grewup. Yes, it's carnival-esque and boisterous and sexy and all the other cliches you associate with Fellini. Butit's also good. This might be the best introduction to his talents, since 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita are inmany ways such a distilled glimpse into his worldview that they're more of an acquired taste. The print islovely and the film contains the many thoughtful, illuminating extras you expect from Criterion.
LAST TRAIN HOME  ($29.99; Zeitgeist) -- One of the most revealing looks at life in contemporary
China, Last Train Home  takes its cue from the annual celebration of Chinese New Year. It's the one
holiday where everyone wants to return to their hometown and sparks a massive exodus from the majorcities back to the heartland. Truly, the movement of literally 130 million migrant workers from one partof the country to another is an overwhelming image and the scenes of people crowded and crushed fordays trying to get onto a train are fascinating. But the film is really about the wrenching changes thaturbanization and the spread of factory work have on families everywhere. You see parents who sacrifice
everything by leaving their children behind to work in factories and then children who resent those
parents -- those strangers, really -- who are never around. To its credit, the movie isn't pro- or anti-anything, just observing what is happening and the human price that is being paid.

<p>DOCTOR WHO: A CHRISTMAS CAROL  ($19.98 BluRay and $14.98 regular DVD; BBC)
DOCTOR WHO: THE MOVIE  ($34.98; BBC) 
DOCTOR WHO: THE MUTANTS  ($34.98; BBC) -- If you're a fan of Craig Ferguson and want to send
him a treat, this is where to start. But act fast: he'll probably be snapping these up right away. The most
recent Doctor Who  Christmas special is almost indecently fun. It should have seemed like cheating to do a
spin on A Christmas Carol but it works and Matt Smith is settling in nicely, isn't he? Doctor Who: The
Movie  was a 1995 TV movie that was meant as a backdoor pilot for relaunching the show (in America, so
I guess we should really have called it a launching) but no one's heart was really in it. $35 for a TV movie,
however lavish and wonderful the copious extras may be is just too much. Finally there's Mutants , a six
part story arc from 1972 starring Jon Pertwee as the good Doctor. I'm a broken record on this, but I wishthey'd release complete boxed sets for each Doctor and be done with it. And $35 for six episodes ($6 anepisode for a 30 year old series) is too pricey. They do present them well, though, I must say.

http://huff.to/edLaIo</p>
<p>DUE DATE  ($35.99 BluRay combo or $28.98 regular; Warner Bros.) -- Hey, it made $100 million in the
US (and the same overseas) so you must have liked it, right? I find Zach Galifianakis asked to do the
same shtick over and over while the film itself is an inferior retread of Planes, Trains & Automobiles,which isn't exactly a comic masterpiece either, just genial. (Now I've ticked off two groups of fans.)Galfinakis is the motor-mouth and Robert Downey Jr. the uptight guy and they're thrown together on across-town journey. Lessons will be learned, whether you like it or not.
KINGS OF PASTRY  ($27.95; First Run Features) -- Despite being made by Chris Hegedus and D.A.
Pennebaker (legends behind everything from Dylan's Don't Look Back to The War Room), there's nothingspecial as a film about this documentary. But the subject that they've found -- sixteen chefs vying for thehonor of France's top pastry award -- is so compelling it's worth watching for foodies and lovers of goodstory alike. Actually, "vying" isn't quite the right word. People spend years and years trying to prepareand succeed at the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France event. It only takes place every four years (like theOlympics) but there is no single top prize. Anyone who hurdles all the barriers can achieve the highhonor. This means a refreshing lack of competition, with pastry chefs and even judges all urging eachother on to their best.</p>
<p>LES MISERABLES 25TH ANNIVERSARY IN CONCERT  ($39.98 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD;
Universal) -- Director Tom Hooper just won the Oscar for Best Director of The King's Speech  and one of
the projects he's reportedly circling is the long-overdue film version of the musical Les Miserables.  He
might as well start here by watching this concert film and reminding himself of the great score it contains
and the talent involved with the show over the years, from Colm Wilkinson (bizarrely given quite low
billing on the cover) to Nick Jonas. Did someone just imagine Lea Michelle singing "On My Own." Oh
yes, it could happen. Here's hoping they avoid stun casting. If the film is three+ hours and has an
intermission, we'll know they're trying to do it right.
WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS: A MAN WITHIN  ($39.99; Oscilloscope) -- Burroughs is such a
perverse figure that he's hard to look at objectively and soberly. This documentary hopes to do so byfocusing on the emotional life of the man, though talking heads like Patti Smith and John Waters are notthe best way to dig deep into his private life. As with all of Oscilloscope's films, the packaging is lovelyand the extras solid. Looking forward to checking it out, even though Burroughs never interested memuch as a writer.</p>
<p>MIDSOMER MURDERS SET 17  ($49.99; Acorn) -- The long-running British crime series in which a
small village -- Midsomer -- is jam-packed with murder and evil to a rather shocking degree. Long-
running lead John Nettles has just packed it in, so these are some of the final episodes he stars in. Theshow, of course, will go on. And on. Four TV movie length episodes with murder on the links, an artauction house, the meadows and more.
REWIND: DEPECHE MODE -- 30 YEARS AT THE EDGE  ($26.95; Pride) -- This is strictly for
hardcore fans of Depeche Mode who want to own every scrap of info on the band. On the other hand, thisunauthorized surface look at the band has very little to offer actual fans already familiar with the group.It's mostly a string of talking heads commenting on the band and of course none of the actual members ofDepeche Mode sat down for an interview. It's 2 hours and 37 minutes long, which is a lot of padding for aset with no videos and only scraps of footage here and there they could lay their hands on.
WEEDS SEASON SIX  ($39.98; Lionsgate)
NURSE JACKIE SEASON TWO  ($39.98; Lionsgate) -- After hitting a rut, Weeds just tossed aside</p>
<p>everything and hit the road. Forced to go on the lam to avoid the Mexican mafia, the newly dubbed
"Newman" family ends up working in a hotel and of course offering pot to the customers checking in whowant to check out for a while. Not wholly successful but a necessary shake-up for a show that had backeditself into a corner and/or run out of things to say. Nurse Jackie, on the other hand, still hasn't quitefigured out what it wants to be, though Edie Falco holds it together simply by acting her ass off, evenwhen it's not quite clear what her motivation is or where the show is headed.
BILL MOYERS: IN SEARCH OF THE CONSTITUTIONBILL MOYERS: A WORLD OF IDEAS -- WRITERS ($79.99 each; Athena) -- Who else but Bill Moyerscould engineer such thoughtful, straightforward, intelligent fare? Constitution is a 10 and a half hour lookat one of our founding documents. Moyer is often lambasted on the right but anyone can find fascinating,lucid information here as Moyers probes the Constitution with the help of four Supreme Court justices,professors, legal scholars, and even Robert Bork. The Writers series is about 7 hours long and savorsconversations with authors like Tom Wolfe, Isaac Asimov, Nadine Gordimer and Toni Morrison. I wishthese were less expensive or streaming on a PBS site so that they could be as widely available. Classicexamples of why public television is so valuable and why it's so prized by most Americans whatever their
politics.
ELEVEN MOVIES COME TO BLURAY -- SHOULD YOU BUY THEM?</p>
<p>The catalog titles flooding onto Bluray keep coming. Done properly, BluRay is indeed a serious step up in
picture quality and (less dramatically) sound. But for many films with fine prints on DVD, I wouldn't feelobliged to upgrade unless the movie is one of your favorites or especially benefits from the sharper image(giant epics, sci-fi spectacles, and the like). Plus, I want to keep encouraging studios NOT to price BluRayDVDs more than regular DVDs. Whenever they're within a few dollars of each other, that's a win in mybook for consumers. So here are 11 new titles to hit BluRay.
THELMA & LOUISE  ($19.99; MGM) -- Now that all the fuss around the movie has settled down and
the hysteria or delight over its feminist overtones has settled down, you can just enjoy it for what it is: a
fun lark of a flick with two actresses -- Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis -- that have great chemistry. Ifyou're really into Brad Pitt, his steaming cameo will be more sharply in focus than ever.
THE STRANGER  ($15.99; HD Cinema Classics) -- Orson Welles made many more great films than just
Citizen Kane. This isn't one of them. It's standard fare about a Nazi war criminal hiding in plain sight in
a college town. Hitchcock offered a similar theme much more interestingly in Shadow Of A Doubt.
Worse, the transfer here is merely serviceable. However, the price is great for a BluRay/regular DVD
combo, a rare offering for a classic older title. Too bad I can't rave about the image.
NETWORK  ($19.98; Warner Bros.) -- Obviously, any great film can be enjoyed more with a better print.
But for me, Network has always been a grainy, visually uninteresting movie filled with some vivid
performances. I also find it a bit dated, no matter how prescient it was about television. So it's a goodmovie and the print here is a notable step up. Essential viewing at least once, though not one I turn toagain and again.
CHAPLIN  ($19.99; Lionsgate) -- How does director Richard Attenborough do it? He's a deadly dull
filmmaker but he's managed to elicit two exceptional performances: Ben Kinglsey as Gandhi and Robert
Downey Jr. as Charlie Chaplin. The movies they're in are more tiresome and ponderous with eachpassing year but the performances are marvelous nonetheless. This BluRay print is fine, though its a pitywe don't get to hear from Downey himself on tackling this role via an audio commentary.
A PRIVATE FUNCTION  ($17.97; Image) -- Despite the great Alan Bennett's involvement and a cast
that can't be faulted -- Michael Palin, Maggie Smith, Denholm Eliott, Richard Griffiths, Alison Steadman</p>
<p>and so on -- this is pretty minor fare about post-war England and how food rationing has turned a black
market pig into a treasure that everyone will beg borrow or steal to acquire. Painless but forgettable. TheBluRay print is not a notable improvement over the regular DVD so no real need for this one.
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN  ($34.99; Warner Bros.) -- A classic thriller, here the BluRay is an
improvement (albeit not truly eye-popping) over the regular DVD and it comes in a very nice hardback
booklet with lots of photos and a nice essay. But if that's their excuse for charging $35 for a movie that
has essentially the same extras as the regular DVD, I'd rather have a boring old plastic case and get it for
$15. Mind you, the 2006 Special Edition of the movie on regular DVD is $26.98. This is no way to
encourage library building or to get people to switch over from regular DVD.
RAIN MAN  ($19.99; MGM) -- The film hasn't aged well in my mind and the BluRay transfer is merely
adequate. But if you're a fan and don't own it yet for some reason, this is okay. As an aside, the MGM
titles make it a little tricky to access the film's menu and get to the extras, at least on my player.
FIVE CORNERS  ($17.97; Image) -- Again, not a step up in visual quality deserving of BluRay. But at
least it's priced under $20. Playwright John Patrick Shanley wrote this Jodie Foster oddball and then
followed up with his directorial debut, the delightful Joe Vs. The Volcano.  A distinctive talent, to say the
least.
LAST TANGO IN PARIS  ($19.99; MGM) -- I'm not a fan of this film particularly; to me, nothing dates
as quickly as a film with pretensions of sophistication and worldliness (as opposed to the real thing). But
it's a landmark film, the BluRay looks good and the sound is solid, which is very important when tryingto suss out the mumblings of Marlon Brando. Worth plunking down for if you're a fan, though no extraswhatsoever if that's important to you.
MEMENTO  ($19.99; Lionsgate) -- Long before people were debating the ending of Inception, they were
debating the ending and beginning and middle of this tricksy drama about a guy who has extremely short
term memory he must leave notes and clues for himself so that when he wakes up with no idea of who heis he can try all over again to piece his life together, stay alive and solve the mystery of what exactly isgoing on. The film looks great and benefits from a second viewing. But while there are new extras, italready came out on BluRay in a fine edition. This is strictly for those late to the party who haven'tbought it yet.
MOONSTRUCK  ($19.99; MGM) -- I'm finishing with the most welcome release of them all.
Moonstruck remains a charmer and among the best work Nicolas Cage and certainly Cher will ever do on
film. The BluRay transfer is fin, but that's not why this is so exciting. The main reason is that Moonstruckis now finally available in widescreen (the way it was shot) in America. Until now, the movie was onlyavailable in horrific pan-and-scan that chops off a third of the picture and ruins a movie's visual charm.You had to buy an all-region player and get a DVD from the UK in order to see it properly. Not any more.
