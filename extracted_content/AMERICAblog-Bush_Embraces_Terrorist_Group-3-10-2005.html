3/10/2005 12:29:00 PMYes, after years of (properly) denouncing Hezbollah, Bush isforced into acknowledging it might play a political role inLebanon's future, much as the IRA's political arm is strugglingto do in Ireland. Ain't reality a pain in the neck?Yes, after decades if not centuries of despotic leaders, twisted"education," harsh religious strictures, miserable livingconditions for the many and unimaginable luxury for the few,Bush is discovering that the will of the people won'timmediately be for secular Western-style democracy with fullrights for women and respect for others.Imagine his confusion:Bush: You want me to say something nice about Hezbollah?Dick: That's right, Mr. President.Bush: But I thought they were the bad guys.Dick: They are the bad guys, Mr. President. Unfortunately,they've also been providing basic services for the Lebanesepeople (like water and power) and have millions of supportersthere.Bush: Maybe we should start providing those services to theIraqis.Dick: I'll be sure and let someone know.Bush: So Hezbollah are good guys now?Dick: No, but we have to deal with them.Bush: I don't understand.Dick: It's like Saudi Arabia -- they're our friends, aren't they?Bush: Sure! I like them.Dick: But they're the single biggest supporter of terrorismaround the world -- much bigger than Iran or Iraq was.Bush: Really?Dick: Yep. And Pakistan. They're our friends but they've soldmore material and know-how to build nuclear weapons torogue governments and terrorist groups than anyone else inthe world.Bush: [sigh] Do we still hate the French?Dick: Yes, Mr. President. We'll always hate the French.
