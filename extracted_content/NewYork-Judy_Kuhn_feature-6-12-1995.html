            <p>Tal1.nt uut-of-Body Experience Sure, she's been nominated 
three times for a Tony Award, 
has just released her debut 
solo album, and has sung at the 
White House and Shea Stadium. But 
Judy Kuhn knows that when the day 
comes to tell stories that will impress her newborn daughter, her 
most recent ac:complishment-providing the singing voice for 
the title character in Disney's upcoming animated film Pocahon· 
tas (opening June 231-is the one that will really win her over. "I 
have the feeling it will be the only 
thing she's impressed with from 
my career," laughs Kuhn, who will 
attend the "Pocahontas in the 
Park" preview at Central Park's 
Great Lawn on June 10. (If you 
don't already have a ticket from 
Disney's mail-in lottery, don't 
even bother showing up. You 
won't get near the screens, and 
the kids will never let you forget 
it.1 Embodying the musical voice 
of a character that existed only in 
pen·and-ink sketches was odd for 
Kuhn, but the thrill of singing 
with a go·piece orchestra was, 
she says, "incredible." As Kuhn 
points out, the largest pit orchestra for a Broadway show is 
about.30 instruments strong. When they recorded the sound· 
track for Pocahontas, she exclaims, ''the string section was big· 
ger than that." MICHA£L GILTZ</p>
