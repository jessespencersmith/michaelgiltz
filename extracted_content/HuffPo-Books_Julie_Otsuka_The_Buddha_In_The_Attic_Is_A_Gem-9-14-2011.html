<p>By Julie Otsuka
$22; Knopf
I read this book in one gulp on a plane flight from London back to New York City. Then I went out and
bought author Julie Otsuka's  debut novel When The Emperor Was Divine.  Then when the final
hardcover edition of The Buddha In The Attic  appeared in my mail, I read it again. It comes in a trim,
smaller format that's perfect for this precise, focused work of just 129 penetrating pages. The jacket
design by Gabriele Wilson is clever and eye-catching, the prose almost forces you to use words like "gem"
and "pearl" and it has that feel of a book destined to become a bestseller. See it and you'll want to pick it
up. Start reading it and you won't want to put it down.
But this suggests a modest endeavor when Otsuka's novel is anything but. It's a boldly imagined work
that takes a stylistic risk more daring and exciting than many brawnier books five times its size. Even the
subject matter is daring, for Otsuka's acclaimed debut told a story about the internment camps where
Americans of Japanese descent were forced to relocate, uprooting and destroying their lives while
Americans with German or Italian descent were essentially left alone. That book became a bestseller and
quickly worked its way onto high school reading lists, which is a testament to the book's accessible prose.
The subject matter surprised me, for Otsuka's new book leads up to that same, shameful event inAmerican history.
That's where the similarities end. Emperor  gathers strength by focusing on one family: a husband who is
dragged away in the middle of the night; the wife he left behind and their two children, the three of
whom are sent together to a camp.
In contrast, The Buddha In The Attic  takes place in the decades between the wars. Instead of one family,
it focuses on a community of Japanese picture brides who travel to San Francisco to be married off to
husbands they've never met before. The distant, reserved voice of the narrator mirrors the reserve of
many of these women overwhelmed by a new world, a new culture and of course married life itself. Itbegins on the ship taking these bewildered, excited, nervous, brave and scared women on the longestjourney of their lives.
On the boat we were mostly virgins. We had long black hair and flat wide feet and we were not verytall. Some of us had eaten nothing but rice gruel as young girls and had slightly bowed legs, and someof us were only fourteen years old and were still young girls ourselves. Some of us came from the cityand wore stylish city clothes, but many more of us came from the country and on the boat we worethe same old kimonos we'd been wearing for years -- faded hand-me-downs from our sisters that hadbeen patched and redyed many times. Some of us came from the mountains, and had never beforeseen the sea, except for in pictures, and some of us were the daughters of fishermen who had beenaround the sea all our lives. Perhaps we had lost a brother or father to the sea, or a fiance, or perhapssomeone we loved had jumped into the water one unhappy morning and simply swum away, and nowit was time for us, too, to move on.
This mesmerizing opening paragraph shows Otsuka's approach at its best: specific, clear, multitudinousin its grasp and subtly emotional. She maintains this level throughout. Some of the girls flirt with sailorson the boat, some get seasick, some feel fine right away, some are worried that their husbands will realizethey're not "fresh" and all of their thoughts and desires and fears are captured in prose. The book followsthem off the boat and slowly, almost to your shock, you realize that Otsuka is not going to focus on one ortwo women or even five or ten. She keeps her eye on the entire community, never once letting anyone fallfrom her grasp.
This sounds like it should be frustrating. Off the boat, some of the women are working the fields
alongside their husbands, others are beaten cruelly and run away, some work in town as maids for whitewomen, others work as prostitutes, some are happy, some are sad, some are not sure how they feel. Atevery step, the women make decisions (or those decisions are made for them) and that takes them offinto an entirely new world of possibilities. And then it happens again and again, a constant branching outof lives and Otsuka limns them all.
This is remarkable on several levels. On the level of pure craftsmanship, it's exciting to see a writer make
such a bold move and succeed so brilliantly -- like watching a juggler who keeps adding ball after ball tothe stream of objects they keep in the air. Each vignette, each story is so riveting, you want to stay withthat character. But Otsuka moves on. If at any moment the next story and character wasn't so enthralling,you would immediately resent this and want to return to the previous thread. But that literally neverhappens, You're pulled inexorably forward by wave after wave of event.

AnonymousOn another level, it's an exceptionally appropriate way to capture the lives of immigrants. By refusing to
focus on one or two or even a dozen "typical" people (a lesser writer would have three or four maincharacters, with one bride heading to the city, one to the country, one off on her own and one intoprostitution), by constantly unfolding the endless possibilities of life, Otsuka reminds us that theimmigrant story will always be immigrant stories . They're as varied and wonderful and heartbreaking as
anyone else's life and never follow a set pattern.
Looming over it all is World War II and the internment camps we know are coming. This is quietly
devastating because Otsuka has done such a masterful job of showing us how specific and varied and
diverse all these people are. So when they're suddenly and brutally treated as foreigners, lumped together
no matter how dramatically different they may be from one another, the injustice of it is doubly striking.
Few writers this year will take the risks that Otsuka does in The Buddha In The Attic.  And I doubt any of
them will do it in a novel so accessible and rich that it's sure to be a favorite for casual readers and critics
alike.
