            <p>Newer PostOlder PostS AT U R D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 4 ,  2 0 0 6The Strokes: The Popsurfing ReviewJust got around to digging into the new Strokes CD while drivingthrough the rain to sell books, pick up mail and play chauffeur whiledirectorboy -- a dandy if there ever was one -- spent time mulling overfabrics and textures at Bergdorf's and Saks.Whether you ignored the hype or were disappointed by the second CD,don't hesitate to pick up "First Impressions On Earth." I defended"Room on Fire," but hearing this makes me realize how much more Ishould have expected. A slightly fuller feel without the Wall of Soundthat was so exciting on the first CD but somewhat monotonous on thesecond. As directorboy said, you can pick out all the instruments now,singer Julian Casablancas does a good Ric Ocasek every once in a whileand after three spins you just know you're going to keep liking it moreand more. The Strokes are in it for the long haul.Best line comes on "Razor Blade" -- "My feelings are more importantthan yours."**** (4/4)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
