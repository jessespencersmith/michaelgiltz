9/14/2005 11:42:00 AMUSA Today does a rundown of the two governors most affectedby Katrina. Blanco was front and center in calling for more aidand expressing displeasure. Barbour seemed in remarkabledenial as he insisted on TV that Bush was doing great -- evenwhile reporters were saying Gulfport and Biloxi Mississippi (justto name two) were in desperate need and FEMA was in shortsupply or not in sight at all. Buried in the article is this tellingcontrast:[Blanco] says that two days after Katrina, desperate forhelp, she couldn't get through to Bush and didn't geta callback; hours later, she tried again, and theytalked....Barbour hasn't had to wait hours to talk to Bush. In fact,Barbour said in an interview with USA TODAY, thepresident called him three to four times in the wakeof Katrina. "I never called him. He always called me,"he said.Mr. President, is it true in the first five days of this disaster that youreached out to the Republican governor of Mississippi and called himthree times? Is it true you NEVER called the Democratic governor ofLouisiana during the first five days of this national tragedy that hadhit her state harder than any other?
