Everyone knows the names of the cast of "Cheers." 
"CHEERS": COMPLETE SECOND SEASON 
"FRASIER": COMPLETE SECOND SEASON 
One sign of a truly great sitcom is that your atten­
tion doesn't wander when an episode focuses on one 
of the secondary characters. That certainly was true 
of "Cheers." For example, when Carla's hairy ex-hus­
band Nick Tortelli showed up, the show was every 
bit as hilarious as when it focused on the love-hate 
torment of Sam and Diane. The same is true for "Fra­
sier," which mines laughs from the travails of Niles, 
Daphne, Martin and Roz just as easily as from the 
pompous Frasier Crane ($49.99 each, Paramount). 
"BABYLON 5": COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON 
"WISEGUY: MEL PROFm" 
"Babylon 5" still ranks as one of the most audacious 
shows in TV history. It was designed from the start 
to tell one long story that would climax in the fifth 
season. In other words, viewers got no truly satisfy­
ing conclusion to anyone season or episode, because 
it was all building up to the grand finale. And what 
were the chances it would last exactly five seasons? It 
did, and this set brings you one step closer to the end 
($99.98, Warner Bros.). "Wiseguy," on the other hand, 
benefited from self-contained story lines that lasted 
roughly half a season, with Kevin Spacey's magnetic 
turn as Mel Profitt ranking as the low-rated show's 
high point ($59_99, Studio Works). 
"IKlRU" 
Director Akira Kurosawa's name instantly brings to 
mind sweeping Shakespearean epics. But many feel 
his masterpiece is 1952's "Ikiru" ($39.95, Criterion), a 
poignant, slow-moving study of a civil servant who is 
dying. No one will be surprised that Criterion does it 
proud, with two extensive documentaries and a 
scholarly commentary track. But the company's HVE 
line deserves more attention as it releases famed Jap­
anese titles less familiar to Westerners, like director 
Kinji Fukasaku's 1968 yakuza thriller "Blackmail Is 
My Life" ($29.95, HVE), a tale of young punks who 
foolishly try to blackmail business associates of a 
major crime boss. It's great fun and ripe for remake. 
"OUT OF TIME" 
Good guy Denzel Washington isn't so noble as a 
Florida lawman who gets duped but good by a pretty 
girl. Mining his misfit side, Washington stars in this 
low-key nair with the moral lawmen should consider 
-never, never "borrow" drug money from the office 
safe to payoff a nice lady's medical bills. 
Also out: 
The gunfight at the OK Corral inspired any number 
of great films, including John Ford's 1946 "My Dar­
ling Clementine," starring Henry Fonda ($19.99, 
Fox); Spencer Tracy was such a brilliant actor, no­
body questioned him when he insisted on playing the 
lead in 1941's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" ($19.98, 
Warner Bros.) without elaborate makeup -he'd sim­
ply suggest the beast within us all, while Frederic 
March used every prosthetic trick in the book in his 
Oscar-winning performance in the 1932 version also 
included; few actors wore a dress as amusingly as 
Cary Grant in Howard Hawks'1949 spoof "I Was a 
Male War Bride" ($14.98, Fox); and maybe joining 
the "Family Business" ($49.98, Showtime) isn't so 
bad when that business is the adult film industry, as 
shown in this truly out-there reality show. 
Out next week: 
The French mystery drama "Swimming Pool"; and 
lots of complete first seasons from TV, namely the 
goofy "Green Acres." the campy "Lost in Space" 
and HBO's "Curb Your Euthusiasm."</p>
