3/03/2005 09:42:00 PMGeorge Bush proves once again how nimble he is at coalitionbuilding. His representatives went to a UN forum on equalityand -- despite being way OT -- tried to demand an idioticinsertion to the main document that made clear nothing shouldbe construed as a "right to abortion." Whatever your stance onabortion, this forum had nothing to do with it whatsoever andthe main document the UN Forum was going to release was anonbinding declaration and not a treaty and no one in theirright mind could have imagined it was creating new humanrights or a right to an abortion. According to the New YorkTimes, even one of the US's own delegates called Bush's actiona "mischievous distraction."Everyone scoffed at the demand and Bush's ambassador EllenR. Sauerbrey was able to get all of two countries to back theamendment: Egypt and Qatar. Boy, nothing says respect forhuman rights like those two. Most other nations, including all25 in the European Union, said it was absurd.In classic Bush fashion, Ambassador Sauerbrey declared this avictory and withdrew the demand.
