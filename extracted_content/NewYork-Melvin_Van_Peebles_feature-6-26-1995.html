Ond.d I:orGEOAGE ARMITAGE · M£TRO(Olat ,a' _., -c The blaxploitation movies of the seventies-with their swanky, gritty world of 
pushers and pimps and big-haired, gun-toting heros-signified the cinemat­
ic arrival of powerful (and often powerfully conuptJ African-American role 
models, as well as some of the most memorable tag lines in movie history ("Don't 
mess aroun' with Foxy Brown. She's the meanest chick in town!" and "Coffy: She'll 
cream you!"J. But the "Blaxploitation, Baby!" festival (featuring Shaft, Super Fly, 
and more than 30 othersl also celebrates a genre spulTed on, like all Hollywood 
trends, by box-office success-specifically, the huge grosses earned by Sweet Sweet­
back's Baadasssss Song (19711. That independent film, written, produced, directed, 
edited, scored, and starring 
Melvin Van Peebles (he also 
wrote the recent Panther, di­
rected by his son Mariol, 
"was not supposed to work," 
says Van Peebles. "Up until 
that time, the belief had been 
that black movies never made 
money. Well, my contention 
was that they hadn't made 
black movies; they had made 
white fantasies of what black 
movies were." Sweet Sweetbaclts anti-he~ superstud run­
ning from the police for virtually the entire film-spawned a 
wave of imitators, though most of them were undercover nar­
cotics or FBI agents. "Sweetback ushered into the cinema vo­
cabulary the black hero," Van Peebles says. "However, it was 
unacceptable to have this hero completely on his own. You had 
the Cotty Browns, the Shafts, and all the others who were al­
lowed to have a flamboyant urban styI~ut they still, in the fi-DONOOItOON ·ttteHAIO~ ,-.J , "; a-,ll'~

nal analysis, were working under the auspices of the bwana." 1____ ., 
Not that Van Peebles thinks these movies should be dismissed. "I think you should see all of them," he says, even 
"nice and frivolous" comedies like Uptown Saturday Night, a 1974 hit starring Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier. "But you 
can't immerse yourself fully. You have to be aware of the mind games that are being played." At Film Forum from June
