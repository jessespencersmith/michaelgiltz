Explicit film gives Canadian 
actress maximum exposure 
BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
CANNES, France -The most atten­
tion-getting film at the 59th annual 
Cannes Film Festival is Shortbus, direc­
tor john Cameron Mitchell's follow-up to 
the cult hit musical Hedwig and the Angry 
Inch. The film's been on everyone's radar 
for years because Mitchell solicited 
actors who were willing to have sex on 
camera. The press screening at Cannes 
was a sold-out free-far-ail as countless 
journalists were turned away and the 
official premiere featured warm applause 
and a standing ovation. 
But anyone expecting hot-and-heavy 
action should look elsewhere. What 
everyone is commenting on is the film's 
sweetness, with the New York Times say­
ing Short bus is "less shocking than dis-dived into the Vancouver arts ~cene. 
trusting to her intuition, 
"My instinct guides me well and there 
are a lot of good people out there," says 
Lee, who adds, "] was very lucky, too." 
She wrote songs, played in an art rock 
band called Bob;s Your Uncle and ulti­
mately moved to Toronto, Lee's TV 
appearances include The Newsroom and 
Sliders in the US She has a major role in 
Thorn Fitzgerald's 3 Needles, 
Lee is certainly proud of the project, 
which was a labor of love. 
And though a very savvy woman, Lee 
is a bit shocked when she looks ahead to 
aU the attention. "Oh my God, is this a big 
deal?" she laughs. "Maybe I've just been 
in denial over the whole thing,"

And at the centre of the ensemble is 
V~ncouver's Sook-Yin Lee. whom Screen 
International singled out as "a real reve­
lation, [Lee] brings not only deft comic 
timing but also a gritty emotional inten­
sity," Mit'flad Giltz is a /reei...HICc wrir4'r bused ill N('lV

In the film, Lee plays Sofia, a New York 
City sex therapist who has never had an 
orgasm. Her solution? Head to Short bus, 
a utopian happening where anything 
goes sexually and the only rule is 10 have 
no rules_ Along with Sofia and her hus­
band Rob, there's a dominatrix, a gay cou­
ple who are feeling they've become too 
routine, group ()'b~es ,md a vampy master 
of ceremonies played by justin Bond of 
the acclaimed duo Kiki & Herb. 
Ifs easily the best 111m role yet for Lee, 
who was a Vj on Much Music for a num­
ber of years and now hosts a CBC radio 
show called Definitely NOl The Opera. 
You might assume anyone willing to do 
a role that involves explicit sex scenes 
(however silly, funny and sweet they're 
played) would be brave in her privme life, 
But Lee says it's the other way around. 
"] was a very socially awkward teenal(­
er -typical adolescent things. When [ 
became unable to talk, [ dovetailed all 
those emotions into artwork ."
