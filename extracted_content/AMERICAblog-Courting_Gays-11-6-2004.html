Morgan ChaseCitigroupMet Lifethe New York Police DepartmentMacy'sTime Warnerand even Tupperwareare among the major companies at the expo."Companies are here just to reach everyone on a personal level.When exhibitors see gays and lesbians, they don't see politics; theysee dollars. It's good business," said one of the organizers said to theNY Post.
