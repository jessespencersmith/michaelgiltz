7/28/2005 02:50:00 PMZach, the blog kid who was forced into the fake "straight camp"program Love in Action and told he should be ashamed ofhimself by his parents is getting out tomorrow. That's whatprompted at least two major stories on these scams. CNN lastnight ran a poor story that didn't even peg itself to the massiveweb story of Zach and his imminent departure.This morning, GMA did virtually the same story, but a bitbetter. (Hey, I'm a late riser and just got around to watchingit.) It talked about Zach and quoted from his blog, used clipsfrom The 700 Club of the boy's awful parents (try loving thechildren you have rather than telling your kids they're awful,folks) and emphasized the dangers to children being forced intothis scam. Diane Sawyer also noted wryly that the head of theprogram struggles with gay desires himself and questioned hisridiculous claims of a 65% success rate.Strikingly, GMA used the same expert from the APA but got abetter quote about the dangers of this debunked andmisleading practice. They also interviewed the same youngman CNN did who went through the program and rejects it butembraces faith and his new boyfriend side by side with a youngman who "graduated" and now works for LIA. (Pity their initialsaren't LIE.)Still, GMA failed to provide context about conversion therapy,how it was founded by two men who ultimately declared theirlove for each other, admitted it was all a fraud and are nowmarried and campaign against it. GMA failed to note how therare "success stories" trumpeted by the far right have provento be failures time and time again. GMA failed to speak to themany experts who have studied these groups or make clearhow health professionals can have nothing to do with them orpotentially lose their license for endangering the health of aclient.GMA failed to emphasize how these groups have alreadyadmitted defeat -- they used to claim they could turn peoplestraight; now apparently everyone admits they're still gay andstruggle with desire but just try not to act on it. That's a far cryfrom what they used to believe -- it admits the fundamentalpoint that being gay is not a choice, something they used todeny heatedly. GMA also failed to tie the hatred these parentshave for their own children to the trial of a man in Florida whokilled his three year old son because he feared the boy was gayand literally tried to beat it out of him.Imagine doing a story on teen steroid use and spending equaltime with the people who extoll its virtues rather than devotingmost air time to the vast majority of the medical and scientificcommunity that condemn it. GMA did a little better job thanCNN, but it could have accomplished much more.NOTE: here are some links to learn more. Disinformation, aSalon story and an HRC report.
