Hidden TV Gem Garrow's Law
A clutch of new releases, including more Oscar nominees (that should have won but didn't), along with some enigmatic road
movies and a little-seen TV series that mystery buffs will enjoy.
THE MASTER  ($39.99 BluRay
combo; Weinstein/Anchor Bay)
HOLY MOTORS  ($39.95 BluRay;
Vivendi) A SIMPLE LIFE  ($29.98
BluRay; Well Go) -- One of thebest films of the year, it's almost a
shame to see The Master  in your
home rather than in gorgeous
70mm in a movie theater. Butnowadays with BluRay and largescreen TVs, chances are you'll beseeing a very good presentation ofthis hypnotic, brilliant film indeed. Iadmired and enjoyed ittremendously on first viewing. Butonce I knew the landscape, once Ihad seen the film, a secondviewing allowed it all to "click" andI fully appreciated what
writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson accomplished here. The entire cast is attheir peak, especially Joaquin Phoenix as a loser seemingly ripe for the pickingby a cult/religion/self-help philosophy, Amy Adams as the Master's controllingand focused wife and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the innovator/self-deluderhimself. Though clearly inspired by the broad brushstrokes of the early days ofScientology, this is not an expose and it's not a look at how someone can bedrawn into a cult. It's about a troubled veteran of World War II, a broken andconfused young man who always had trouble dealing with others and tampingdown his own personal demons. This cult, this religion, this family is his bestshot at a happy life but he may be incapable of taking it. That is the fascinatingstory that emerges. If you're looking for a tale of a shyster, you will bedisappointed. That's why those who embrace Scientology might not be botheredby the film and it's also why this is a richer, more complex work than yet anothertale of a hypocritical con man a la Elmer Gantry  and the like. Among the extras is
the very unexpected and very welcome appearance of director John Huston's1946 documentary about WW II veterans called Let There Be Light.  Far more
opaque is Holy Motors,  another movie beloved of critics in 2012 but not seen by
a wide audience. I grew frustrated by the film which has a vague driving narrative
that they seem to spell out or hint at (it's never fully clear what's going on) but
then break their own rules. Nevertheless, Denis Lavant has great fun as a mysterious man sent around a city in a limousine to
don disguises and act as a catalyst in various scenes and/or real life events. He plays women and men, young and old and it'sa genuine treat to watch him cavort, even if the film is ultimately a rather flimsy excuse. I did especially love the beautiful scenedone in a motion capture studio set. Far more direct and accessible is A Simple Life,  another critically acclaimed film and under
the radar to most. It deserves a bigger audience on DVD and BluRay since this story of a famed movie producer who mustsuddenly care for the nanny that has served his family for decades is universal and appealing. Andy Lau and Deanie Ip star asthe mogul and the maid.

<p>AFRICA  ($29.98 DVD; BBC Earth)
THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY
($24.99 DVD; PBS) -- Five newdocumentaries including one ofthe best films of the year. How ToSurvive A Plague  is about the
AIDS crisis and how a group ofvolunteers educated themselvesand fought back when faced withmassive indifference by thegovernment and the medical
community. Without minimizing the
constant loss, the film is actually apositive one, filled with humor andinsight. It also tackles a verycomplex issue -- how AIDS groupslike ACT-Up revolutionizedmedical research and care foreverin this country and around theworld by giving patients a voiceand a place at the table wheredecisions are made -- and tells itwith deceptive ease and clarity.Excellent. ( It's no surprise ABC is
turning this into a miniseries.Smart choice.) Sophie Fiennescontinues to grow as adocumentary filmmaker with OverYour Cities Grass Will Grow.  This
is a strong look at the artist
Anselm Kiefer and his creative process in developing large scale works.Gorgeous. Bestiaire  is an odd duck, a film that watches people watching
animals, or is that animals watching people. Deceptively simple but quiteinteresting and very well shot. Africa  is a typically gorgeous looking BBC
documentary, narrated by the voice of God naturalist David Attenborough. Notequal to their peak work but solid. Finally, writer-director Chip Duncan takes an"unbiased" which is to say sober but not terribly insightful look at The ReaganPresidency  in a three hour work best at illuminating his decisive part in ending
the Cold War alongside Mikhail Gorbachev.
THE LONELIEST PLANET($24.98 DVD; Sundance Selects)SILENT SOULS  ($29.99 DVD;
Zeitgeist) -- Two enigmatic roadmovies. The Loneliest Planet  stars
Gael Garcia Bernal as one half ofan engaged couple that heads out
on a hiking trip in Georgia,
formerly of the Soviet Union. Youmust pay close attention to thisone; a brief moment is the hingeon which the movie turns. Miss itand you'll be wondering exactlywhat the heck is going on. Itenjoyed great acclaim from the arthouse critics. Also set in Russia,Silent Souls  shows a husband
taking his late wife's remains on a
pilgrimage, telling the story of their marriage along the way. Beautifully shot, itand other road movies from that country seem to indicate all of Russia is on aquest of some sort, lost and mapless at best.</p>
<p>GARROW'S LAW THE
COMPLETE COLLECTION($79.99 DVD: Acorn)THE PRIME OF MISS JEANBRODIE  ($49.99 DVD; Acorn)
MAIGRET: THE COMPLETECOLLECTION ($59.99 DVD;Acorn)ROCKO'S MODERN LIFE THECOMPLETE SERIES ($29.93
DVD; Shout)IRON ROAD  ($19.98 DVD; EONe)
-- Garrow's Law  hasn't made
much of an impression in the US.And to make matters worse, it wascancelled in the UK after just threeseasons. But it's a superiorcourtroom drama/mystery seriesthat Anglophiles should snap up.Not in the absolute top tier ofFoyle's War,  but very satisfying.
Andrew Buchan stars as thehistorical figure William Garrow,the man who became famous forhis work at the Old Bailey, whereRumpole would later harrumpharound. Each episode typicallyinvolves a case that illuminates lifein the 1700s and allows Garrow tolearn from his mentor (AlunArmstrong) and benefit from the
support of Lady Sarah (Lyndsey
Marshall of Being Human ). Fun
stuff. The Prime Of Miss Jean
Brodie  is a seven part miniseries
from 1978 starring GeraldineMcEwan in the role made famousby Maggie Smith in the earlier filmof the same name. Author MurielSparks preferred McEwan but ofcourse she had the advantage oftelling the story more fully. Thegreat Michael Gambon is always ajoy to watch and his intelligenceand sheer presence make Maigretworthwhile. But the mysteries andsupporting actors are not up tosnuff and keep this series frombeing more than a pleasantdiversion. Rocko's Modern Life
was among the wave of anarchic
cartoons that led by Ren & Stimpy
pushed the boundaries for whatmere cartoons could tackle. Thisset contains all 52 episodes (thebroadcast versions so a threeminor trims keep some naughty
bits sadly unavailable) and is welcome anarchy and silliness about a wallaby who tries to get along after moving from Australiato the US. Finally, Iron Road  is a better than average Canadian miniseries about the building of the railroad. it stars Sam Neill
and Peter O'Toole in one of his final turns.
THE TERMINATOR  ($19.99
BluRay; MGM)THE INSIDER  ($20.00 BluRay;
Touchstone) -- The Terminator  is a
genuine B movie by JamesCameron, a bit of sci-fi nonsensemade on a dime with a lot of witand smarts to compensate for the</p>
<p>low budget. it's always the lavish
T2 that gets the deluxiest
treatment on laser disc and DVDand BluRay. But the originalTerminator  finally gets a proper
transfer to BluRay and looksterrific. The Insider  is simply
director Michael Mann's best film;this look at corruption in thetobacco industry and journalistic
ethics can stand alongside All The
President's Men  and that's high praise indeed. Excellent cast all around.
