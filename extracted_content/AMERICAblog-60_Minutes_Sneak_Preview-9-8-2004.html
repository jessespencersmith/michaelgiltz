9/08/2004 02:16:00 PMHere are some advance quotes from Ben Barnes, the former TexasHouse speaker and Lt. Governor who says he now regrets helpingGeorge W. Bush jump the line and get into the Texas Air NationalGuard ahead of other young men who were also afraid to go toVietnam but didn't have the family connections that Bush did.Barnes told interviewer Dan Rather:Barnes on His Decision to Help George W. Bush and Others Get Intothe National Guard:"I've thought about it an awful lot and you walk through the Vietnammemorial, particularly at night like I did a few months ago and, I tellyou, you'll think about it a long time.... I don't think that I had anyright to have the power that I had to choose who was going toVietnam and who was not going to Vietnam. That's power. In someinstances, when I looked at those names, I was maybe determininglife or death and that's not a power that I want to have...."Barnes on his Feelings of Regret:"It would be very easy for me to sit here and tell you, Dan, that I hadwrestled with this and lost a lot of sleep at night, but I wouldn't betelling you the truth. I... not eagerly, but readily, was willing to calland get those young men into the National Guard that were friends ofmine and supporters of mine.... Reflecting back, I'm very sorry aboutit, but you know, it happened and it was because of my ambition, myyouth and my lack of understanding. But it happened and it's not...something I'm necessarily proud of."The piece airs tonight at 8 p.m. on CBS.
