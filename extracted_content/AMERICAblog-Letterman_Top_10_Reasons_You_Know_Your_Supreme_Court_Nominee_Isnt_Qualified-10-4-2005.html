10/04/2005 02:27:00 AMLetterman's Top 10 list mocked Miers as being hopelesslyunqualified. (My favorite? You know your nominee isunqualified when she runs around saying, "When does mamaget to hang somebody!") Is there any possibility she's a feint,some red meat for the Left to angrily reject and exhaust itselfon, with the next nominee being a far right radical that they'llbe accused of "obstructing?" There's no need to imagine Bushis so devious -- he's nominated unqualified hacks for majorposts his entire career, so why should this be any different?The Right seems to be angry about Miers. So the question iswhether the Left should reject the nomination of someone whowould NEVER be seriously considered for the Supreme Courtunder normal circumstances or accept her and pray she's not awacko because Bush's next nominee might be a true terrorinstead of a joke. What do you think?
