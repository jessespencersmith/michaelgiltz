4/17/2005 01:56:00 PMYes, Tom DeLay's ethical morass and hate-filled speech was thefocus on all three major Sunday morning news shows. "MeetThe Press" did the best job and Rep. Barney Frank had the bestline. He said he'd been the focus of ethics probes fifteen yearsago because he'd "behaved inappropriately." But here's thedifference."I changed my behavior," said Frank. "Tom DeLay changed theethics committee."As everyone knows, DeLay was admonished three times in2004 for ethical lapses, more than any other politician, Ibelieve. But as Frank points out, instead of cleaning up hishouse, DeLay hammered the Republicans into weakening theEthics Committee, reverting to the rules they'd just changed in1997, making it far more difficult to bring an ethicsinvestigation forward and purging the committee of the threeRepublicans who dared to stand up for ethical behavior and hadDeLay slapped on the wrist.
