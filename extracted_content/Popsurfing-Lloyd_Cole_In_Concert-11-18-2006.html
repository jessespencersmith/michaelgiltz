            <p>S AT U R D AY,  N O V E M B E R  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6Lloyd Cole In ConcertI can't really enjoy a rock concert in a club with a velvet rope (howridiculous), but inside the Canal Room was fine, albeit with drinks wayoverpriced. Still, Lloyd Cole packed 'em in and was his usual literateself. Two amusing moments. First, onstage was a Mac laptop and a tinykeyboard. I joked to my guest TJ that Cole was gonna simply play theMac all night and then darned if that didn't seem to be the case.Ultimately, it was Cole and one other guitarist with all other backingprogrammed into the computer or played by Cole on keyboard. Butfirst he came out and just started a Brian Eno-like musical soundscapeand then doodled on the keyboard for a few minutes. People politelyapplauded when it was over. Cole jokingly toweled off as if it had beenexhausting, mumbled "thanks" rather drily and then played another.And then another. And then another. My God, was this going to be anight of instrumentals? Then Cole said we were the only audience toapplaud the first tune of the night. "One man in Sweden said hethought I was doing a sound check," said Cole. I'll bet he makes thatjoke/compliment every night.But another comment later was truly unique. I'm sure I've never heardthis before. Cole looked out into the audience and said he saw a lot ofcouples. I'm paraphrasing, but Cole said, 'The level of desire to be hereisn't always equal. For all of you who've come here tonight with yourpartners and endured far too much of my music over the years and yetstill came here tonight, I thank you.' Thanking the dates of the hardcorefans who've been dragged to his shows and heard his albums again andagain -- that was truly charming, I thought. Few artists would have theself-confidence to recognize that not everyone is a fan of his music --much less recognize that some of the people at that very concert wereprobably dragged there by their dates. No wonder he's been able tosurvive for 22 years in the industry with his dignity intact.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
