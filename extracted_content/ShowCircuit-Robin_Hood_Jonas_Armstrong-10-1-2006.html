Reinventing Robin 
The hero of Sherwood Forest rides again 
in a new BBe television series. 
By Michael Giltz 
WHEN LITTLE CHILDREN (especially 
those lucky enough to be around hors­
es) play make-believe, two games are 
constant: cowboys and Indians, and 
Robin Hood. That's one reason Robin 
Hood is always being reinvented. 
Errol Flynn's iconic 1938 film version 
is the standard, of course, but recent 
years have seen Sean Connery and Au­
drey Hepburn face old age in Robin and 
Marian (1976), Kevin Costner helplessly 
tackle a British accent in Robin Hood: 
Prince of Thieves, and author Nancy 
Springer create a distaff teen version in 
her series of young adult novels that 
began with Outlaw Princess of Sherwood: 
A Tale Of Rowan Hood in 2003. 
Thus it probably seemed like the 
most natural thing in the world for 25-
year-old actor Jonas Armstrong to play 
one of the most famous heroes in histo­
ry for a new 13-part television series for 
the BBC. Slightly less natural was being 
whisked from a film location in India to 
Budapest, where a lavish set recreated 12th-century England so he could play 
the nobleman turned outlaw. It begins 
airing in the United States on BBC 
America this March. 
There was one problem, however: 
Armstrong had never ridden a horse. 
"When he arrived in Hungary, he 
wasn't good enough yet;' admits Bela 
Unger, a Hungarian stunt man and the 
leader of "Hood Academy," the nick­
name of the two-week course in riding, 
swordplay, and other stunt work the ac­
tors went through before filming began. 
"Jonas is working with a very nice 
brown Hungarian horse called Pedro, 
who is very experienced and very 
knowledgeable. He knows what we need 
on a set;' notes Unger. 
Clearly, Unger knows the faith he can 
place in the animals he works with is 
going to be well-founded. After six 
months of filming on the highly antici­
pated series (the casting of the new 
Robin Hood made headlines in the 
U.K.), Armstrong is grateful for the 
SHOW CIRCUIT ® FALL 2006 brusque, businesslike manner of his 
trainers. 
"You can't go into it a bit hesitant;' 
says Armstrong, best known for his per­
formance on the u.K. drama Teacher. 
"You've just got to fling yourself in. I 
landed in Budapest on a Sunday, and on 
a Monday I was up at the crack of dawn 
and I was introduced to Bela. He doesn't 
take any bullshit;' laughs the actor. 
"He said, 'OK. This is Pedro. This is 
your horse. He knows everything. OK. 
On you get: There's no messing around 
here; there are no airs and graces with 
the Hungarians; just get on with it and 
do it." 
So Armstrong just got on with it. His 
Robin Hood isn't the merry fellow who 
dashes about in green tights either. 
"He can be a very selfish character 
and arrogant," Armstrong observes of 
their modern take on Mr. Hood. "He 
loves himself. He's not with his hand on 
hips, saying, 'Ha ha, I'm a hero!' None of 
this, 'Maid Marian, I shall sweep you off 
your feet!' He can't be too selfish, of 
course. You do see him put his life on 
the line for others:' 
Armstrong had little time to prepare 
for the biggest break of his young career. 
Although who wouldn't have fun play­
ing Robin Hood? That's as basic a thrill 
as it gets for any actor. 
"It is great fun;' admits Armstrong. 
"You do enjoy it when you're having the 
fights, because Robin is supposed to 
enjoy fighting. But you can't look like 
you're enjoying it too much because 
you're supposed to be thinking about a 
hundred things at the same time, so you 
can't be, 'A-ha! I'm fighting away!' I want 
a bit of menace." 
Happily, the equetsrian and other re­
quired skills weren't menacing to the 
star. Riding came fairly easily and, like 
most theatrically trained actors, Arm­
strong was already well-grounded in 
swordplay. But how handy is he with a 
bow and arrow? 
''I'm OK," Armstrong responds with a 
smile. ''I'm good. I'm better than your av­
erage guy, but I wouldn't say I'm amaz­
ing. Thank God the modern technology 
of TV can make me look fantastic." •</p>
