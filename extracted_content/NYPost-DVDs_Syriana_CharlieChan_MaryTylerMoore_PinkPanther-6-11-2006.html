Z The World's Fastest 
Indian ** Magnolia, $26.98 
A by-the-numbers bio-pic 
about an old coot in New 
Zealand who sets off for 
Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats to 
set a land-speed record on his 
Indian motorcycle. The most 
shocking revelation? Anthony 
Hopkins is still capable of giv­
ing a relaxed, cliche-free per­
formance . Everything else is 
sleep-inducing. 
Dave Chappelle's 
Block Party 
**'1, 
Universal, $29,98 
AN amiable if shambling 
documentary that shows the 
genial Chappelle pulling 
together a dream block party 
with terrific musical guests. 
No gangstas here, just smart 
talent like Mas Def, Erykah 
Badu and the Fugees. A bonus 
making-of documentary is 
nice, but where is the footage 
of every performance unedit­
ed and uninterrupted? 
Also out: Director Rob Rein­
cr's delightful gem "The 
Princess Bride: Collector's Edi­
tion" (Paramount; $24.96): the 
tightest pants in San Francis­
co are documented in ''That 
Man: Peter Berlin" (Water 
Bearer Films; $29.95); and 
Steve Martin seems hopeless­
ly lost in "The Pink Panther" 
(Sony, $28.95). 40

***'1, 
Warner Bros., $28.98 
ALL you need to know to 
follow this complex drama is 
one word: oil. Everyone 
wants it or needs it -
everyone is made rich or 
impoverished by it. A very 
good directori al effort by 
screenwriter Stephen 
Gaghan, with Matt Damon, 
Jeffrey Wright and George 
Clooney all terrific. The only 
drawback: modest extras 
(like deleted scenes) when 
we really wanted an 
education , 
SMARTEST GUY IN THE ROOM: 
Oland in "Charlie Chan in Paris." 
Charlie Chan: 
Volume 1 
-1 ... ** 
~Ol(, $59.98 
YES. Warner Oland is in 
"yellow face" playing the 
great detective. But Chan is 
always the smartest man in 
the room and one of the most 
positive images of Asians 
that Hollywood ever 
produced. You get four flicks, 
including the long-lost 
"Charlie Chan in Paris" 
(935). Even better, Lucy Liu 
will remake Chan when she 
plays him in a 2007 feature. 
The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show: 
Complete Fourth 
Season 
**** 
Fox, $29.98 
IS it possible? Four seasons 
into the show, they say 
goodbye to central characters 
like Rhoda and Phyllis. yet it 
keeps getting better. No other 
sitcom ever kept improving 
like this -thanks in part to 
the introducti on of man­
hungry Sue Ann Nivens 
(Bettv White), No extras, but 
why bother gilding the lily? 
Clark Gable: The 
Signature Collection 
***';' Warner Bros., 559.98 
SIX good to great movies 
starring Gable, with modest 
extras. Standouts include 
1936's epic disaster flick "San 
Francisco" and the under­
appreciated gem "Boom 
Town" from 1940. That drama 
.. has Gable and Spencer Tracy 
drilling for oil, makin!( and 
losing money with "bandon .</p>
