RATINGS COVERAGE:  With the Olympics out of
the way, American Idol scored 23.4 million viewers,
according to The Hollywood Reporter.  Though the
format was different last season (with semi-finalists
put in groups of 12), that's a modest 3-4% drop from
last season's performance show on March 3, when the
show scored 24.3 million viewers. Idol  beats the
closing ceremonies of the Olympics to be #1 this week,but next week belongs to the Oscars. After that, it's
smooth sailing to the season finale when Idol  will
retain its crown as the #1 show on TV for the sixth straight year, the first to do so in the history of
television.
SHOW COVERAGE:  A good improvement for a number of men this week on American Idol ...but then,
so many of them had so much room for improvement.MICHAEL LYNCHE  -- Sang James Brown's iconic #8 hit "It's A Man's Man's Man's World," which hit
the Top 40 the week I was born. Lynche benefited from doing exactly what Simon said: command the
stage. Instead of being amiable, he was forceful and strong. Yes, when he got soulful, he garbled some
lyrics. But for the first time, he seems like a contender. Solid.
JOHN PARK  -- Sang John Mayer's "Gravity." He started off rough, then when the song got slower, he
was worse, and it all felt a bit interminable. But it wasn't as bad as last week. Better, but not good. Will
being cute keep him safe for another few weeks?
CASEY JAMES  -- Sang Gavin DeGraw's lone Top 10 hit, "I Don't Want To Be," which has been
performed a gazillion times on Idol . James apparently doesn't have a TV but once he realized how often
it's been done, he should have picked something else. His guitar playing was fun but it's not good when
the vocals seem like an afterthought. On the chorus, which sort of meanders down, he really struggled
and faded out at the end of lines. But the show loves him; he got a flashy low-camera intro and lots ofactive cutting to jazz it up.

<p>ALEX LAMBERT  -- Sang John Legend's "Everybody Knows." I love that Lambert invented his own
language and he almost certainly won the sympathy vote with his stories of nervousness and throwing up
before sporting events, much less Idol . (Don't knock the sympathy vote; anything to stay alive!) Yes, he
was very improved but since he had so far to come that's not saying much. Lambert did sound pretty
forceful at the moments where he dug in. But he was still very nervous and shaking and what an awfullast note. Still a long ways to go and the judges overreacted with their praise. (Lose the mullet.)
TODRICK HALL  -- Sang Tina Turner's career-defining, sole #1 hit "What's Love Got To Do With It."
Last week he did Kelly Clarkson, so I thought, cool, he's gonna keep taking songs made famous by
women until he gets it right. But he took a song that's already pretty slow (though in a deceptive way;
Turner keeps it jaunty) and made it even slower. When he started to move it got a little better but thenhe had a horrible finale. And how can the judges say Tina Turner's song isn't relevant? It's a classic! Notgood but not disastrous.
JERMAINE SELLERS  -- Sang Marvin Gaye's brilliant #2 hit "What's Going On." I thought Simon was
going to nail him when he started to describe the song as a great...pop song. Almost, but not quite. Here's
the problem: Sellers sang one of the greatest protest songs of all time as if it were a love song. Maybe he
thought he was singing "Let's Get It On?" Seriously, did he even pay the slightest attention to the lyrics?"There's far too many of you dying.... War is not the answer..." and so on. But watch him perform andyou'd swear he was romancing you. Sellers was smiling and even winking at one point, I think. When a
singer is that completely divorced from the lyrics, nothing good can happen artistically. If he wanted to
bring passionate gospel fervor, this could have been the perfect time to take it to church. Instead, he tookit to the bedroom.
ANDREW GARCIA  -- Sang James Morrison's debut single "You Give Me Something." (Morrison's sure
getting performed a lot for a guy who's never had a Top 40 hit in the US.) He was weak, especially on the
chorus and kept moving his arms robotically. It was so-so, not awful but sometimes that's worse since
memorably bad is at least memorable.
AARON KELLY  -- Sang the first #1 hit of The Temptations, "My Girl." I knew Aaron was going to break
out or flame out when he did the whole, head-shaking thing. (You know, that back and forth sort of
Egyptian-ish thing.) Now here's where it gets confusing. A lot of times I criticize singers for riffing all
over the place and singing their asses off a la Mariah Carey when they've barely even sung the melody.
But you can do anything you want if it works. And for me, Kelly's runs and pretty convincing growl on"my girl" and his massive amount of vibrato all worked for me. He was really quite good, although like
almost everyone he ended weakly. But even if he'd been terrible, I would take issue with the judges, who
all insisted the song was too old-fashioned, not contemporary, not relevant. Huh? It's a pop classic. It'snot like he was doing some Tin Pan Alley number or John Park's disastrous take on Billie Holiday's "GodBless The Child." It's a timeless pop classic and people can sing it from now until doomsday as long as
they do it well. Kelly did it pretty well. Ryan asking him if he liked Justin Bieber made me laugh. There's
no good answer to that one, Ryan. Saying no annoys the girls who like him and Bieber as well; saying yesmakes him look uncool.
TIM URBAN  -- Sang Matt Nathanson's hit "Come On Get Higher," which sold a million copies. Leagues
better than last week, though he set the bar so low that's not saying much. In fact, he wasn't bad and I
agree with Simon. Kind of hit a groove in the middle, though again he hit a very very rough last note.
Ellen's comment that he should act -- despite having no stage presence -- made no sense. Yes, it's nicewhen a cute actor can also sing, sort of, but it's even better when they can really sing. (And the cast ofGlee  can really sing.) And if you have no stage presence as a singer you'll probably have no stage presence
as an actor.
LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang Hinder's #3 hit "Lips Of An Angel." It's easy to see the producers are rooting for
him. He got wildly dramatic lighting, with the theater darkened during his first moments for the total
rock star effect. But the audience started squealing during the first few lines (talent show Nashville Starloves it when that happens!) and I thought he looked very confident, hitching up his pants when he
wanted to and smiling when girls screamed but digging into the lyrics. Some of the lyrics got mumbled
when he was getting "passionate," but overall I thought he was quite effective. Too bad for him Karastepped over Simon's big line that Lee may be the one to beat.
Too many ready for home to pick two. I'll just say that Lee Dewze and Casey James and Michael Lynche
and Aaron Kelly are safe. Who did you like this week? And who's going home?

541 FansMediaCurve s.com conducted a poll on 3,804 American Idol viewers’ perception s of which male
contestant s should be eliminated from the top 20 on tomorrow’s results show. Viewers selected Lee
Dewyze as the contestant who should advance to the next round of the competitio n based on his
performanc e last night. The contestant s with the lowest percentage of votes were Jermaine Sellers,
with 2.9%, and Todrick Hall, with 4.3% of the votes. The study will parallel American Idol voting to
determine the weekly winners based on a democratic , “one person, one vote” methodolog y.

Thanks,Ben
My ranking out of 10:
Dewyze 8Big Mike 7.5
Andrew Garcia 5.5
John Park 5.5Casey 6Lambert 7Todrick 4Jermaine 3 Aaron 6Tim 6 (I think Ellen means he needs to "act" the part). 
Overall I was much happier with the performanc es over last week., so that helps keep the interest
alive. I am most interested in how Dewyze and Lambert evolve.
Lynch's performanc e was the only one that I could stand to listen to again. Entertainm ent Weekly
called them The Boys of Slumber, and boy, ain't that the truth.
Hall and Sellers have more attitude than talent...( "you should come hear me in church"). Seriously?
It wouldn't be worth the gas money. I have my styrofoam brick ready to throw at the TV whenever
either of them get around to butchering Sam Cooke.
Others are cute lightweigh ts. When Casey has an off-week, you know the guys are in trouble. He
should have a TV, then he would know people got sick of that Gavin DeGraw song just from
hearing it on "One Tree Hill". And who knew Garcia's brilliant rendition of "Straight Up" would come
back to ruin him.
I'll say it again. The Final 10 should be 8 females and 2 guys. Until the show becomes a meritocrac
y rather than an even-steve n male-femal e connivance , it deserves to be the train-wrec k it is
promising to be.

59 Fansand sang got panned for not "changing it up" or "taking a risk"..... what are the judges looking for?
Yep, the judges can often be contradict ory, which gets confusing for the artists who don't
know themselves and what they want to do. I always say criticism boils down to this: it
didn't work. The rest is up to the singers.
Jermaine Sellers and John Park need to go home.
Agreed.
No argument here.
What I always listen for is one word: elevation. Did the singer elevate the music through their
choices? And by elevate I mean did the singer make the music primary and not themselves . I think
three did last night:
Michael Lynch had the greatest performanc e of the night. Truly masterful artistry. No need for
words. Just watch/list en to him.
Otherwise, Ellen got it exactly right when she said that Alex Lambert was something unique. The
quality of his voice is something one can only be born with. And the fact that despite his nerves, hedelivers almost a flawless vocal performanc e is a testament to the natural facility of his one of a
kind voice. All the nervousnes s and inexperien ce is surely a plus. If you have a one in a million
voice and know how to use it, sit in a chair and sing for all I care.
Believe it or not, Tim Urban was the only other one that stood out for me. I think the judges (minus
Simon) need to listen to his performanc e back on video. He was strong and on pitch. It was a great
song for him. It was simple and it really worked. He connected and elevated the music.
I think Aaron Kelly had the potential to do something special last night. Sadly his voice sounded
really tired and that just completely distracted me .. and him .. from connecting , elevating the music.
His battle with his voice became primary, not the music
Alex does indeed have a cool voice. Thanks for commenting .Permalink  | Share it
