            <p>T U E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 0 ,  2 0 0 7Craig Ferguson's Britney MonologueThe Associated Press reports on how Craig Ferguson DIDN'T make funof Britney Spears in his monologue last night. But they didn't reallycapture the riveting, sincere sermon Ferguson delivered. He's reallygrown on me over the last year and Ferguson's opening chats arealways rambling, personal affairs. Last night, he was impassioned,talking about his battles with alcoholism and urging Spears to get somehelp via some tough love comments about her having two kids butbeing a child, a 25 year old child. The only thing I can compare it to areKeith Olbermann's gripping essays on MSNBC. It was personal andmoving and funny, sort of like that scene from "Network" if the guyhadn't gone insane. Good stuff.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

And he even jokes about that.Craig is the guy who can change the face of late night television... andremind us, in the process, that we really do have a moral conscience.6:51 PM
