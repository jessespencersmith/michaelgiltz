4/27/2005 12:44:00 AMThe Washington Post reports that the senate Finance Committeholding hearings on President Bush's plan to dismantle SocialSecurity reveals the Dems are united and the Republicans arebadly divided.One GOP witness repeatedly disparaged the White House'sapproach to Social Security changes, bolstering Democraticcontentions that it would lead to politically untenablebenefit cuts. Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) questioned thewisdom of adding trillions of dollars in federal debt in thecoming decades to finance the president's plan. And Sen.Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) seemed to signal intractableopposition to converting part of the defined Social Securitybenefit to variable returns from stock and bondinvestments.I'd give credit to the Dems for doing a good job but with one caveat:the Republicans have been idiotically bad on this and so many otherissues that simply standing still has allowed the Dems et al to looklike political geniuses. When the other guy is shooting himself in thefoot, all you have to do is avoid the ricochet.
