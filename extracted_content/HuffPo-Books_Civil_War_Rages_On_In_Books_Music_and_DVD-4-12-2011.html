THE CIVIL WAR RAGES ON...A RUNDOWN OF
NEW BOOKS, MUSIC AND CLASSIC DVDS
Today marks the 150th anniversary of the beginning of
the Battle Of Fort Sumter.  "Rebels" -- or as I like to call
them, traitors -- launched this attack which led to the
Civil War, an attempt to permanently destroy the UnitedStates of America. It is the most painful and raw andfascinating period in American history and the stream ofbooks and articles and works of art about the Civil warcontinues unabated. President Abraham Lincoln alonehas been the subject of so many books it could fill agood-sized library. I once saw a movie or play or read abook in which a character was described without
hyperbole as having read every single book on the Civil War. That is literally impossible to do today andgrows more impossible with each passing year. (It's impossible to read 20,000 volumes; it's even more
impossible to read 40,000.) But that shouldn't stop you from trying. Here are some of the new books,
albums and reissues of classic TV works on the War of Southern  Aggression. (Hey, they fired the first
shot!)

<p>THE SIEGE OF WASHINGTON: THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE TWELVE DAYS THAT
SHOOK THE UNION  By John Lockwood & Charles Lockwood ($27.95; Oxford University Press) --
After the seizure of Fort Sumter, the entire country held its breath. Washington DC was surrounded bystates either seceding from the Union or liable to do so. It was virtually undefended and any rebel forcescould saunter into town, seize power and quite possibly imprison or even hang Lincoln and any Northernpoliticians found there. Lincoln called for troops from northern states to come protect the nation'scapitol. But who would get there first? Northern troops loyal to the country and the rule of law? Ortraitors who had potentially seized a massive cache of weapons at Harper's Ferry? To make mattersworse, Lincoln wasn't even sure any Northern states would respond to his call for soldiers. And DC itselfwas filled with traitors at all levels of government who sympathized with the South and spied for them or
quit their jobs outright. This book by two brothers goes day by day, capturing the drama at every turn.
Soldiers bivouacked inside the half-built Capitol building, the unfinished dome leaving them open to thenight skies. Lincoln going amongst the few soldiers in town late at night, shaking their hands and offeringwords of comfort and praise. Riots in Baltimore when Northern troops passed through. Clara Barton --who would found the Red Cross -- practicing her excellent marksmanship and being mocked and spatupon by fellow employees in the Patent Office who lined the halls to abuse her because she was a womanand intelligent and anti-slavery. Those are some of the vivid moments captured here, along withnighttime raids, hijacked trains and countless missed opportunities by the South. It's an entertainingglimpse of a key early moment in the struggle for this nation's soul. One negative comment: it won'tdiminish the pleasure for casual readers, but it must be a sad reflection of tightened budgets in
publishing when even a book from a notable press like Oxford can be littered with missing or repeated
words and phrases and other examples of copyediting. Maybe one advantage to ebooks would be theability to send out a cleaner version at no cost even after a book has been purchased?
NOTE: Oxford University Press contacted me to say the errors in this book were the result of a
miscommunication between editors and the printers; changes that were intended to be made got lost inthe shuffle on this project. All changes will be corrected in later editions. They were glad these errorswere not taken as a reflection on the authors and the work at hand and insist it was a one-off error andnot reflective of OUP's quality control in general.

What Authors and</p>
<p>CIVIL WAR NAVAL SONGS  ($15 for CD; $10 for MP3; Smithsonian Folkways)
A TREASURY OF CIVIL WAR SONGS  ($15 for CD; $10 for MP3; Smithsonian Folkways) -- One new
album and a classic reissue provide a wealth of Civil war-era music. You don't think about the sea very
much when it comes to the Civil War, but there's a lot more to heard than just "The Monitor &Merrimac" apparently. Singers Dan Millner, David Coffin and Jeff Davis (!) perform tunes on Civil WarNaval Songs like "The Blockade Runner" and "A Yankee Man-Of-War" accompanied by periodinstrumentation. Treasury  is a reissue of the 1973 folk gem by Tom Glazer that hits all the highlights
you'd expect like "John Brown's Body" and "When Johnny Comes Marching Home." Both are ideal forCivil War buffs and folkies looking for unfamiliar tunes.
A GLORIOUS ARMY: ROBERT E. LEE'S TRIUMPH 1862-1863  By Jeffry D. Wert ($30; Simon &
Schuster) -- Ironically, the book from the academic press OUP is perfect for a general audience while thebook from a more general press (Simon & Schuster) is really for hardcore Civil War buffs. Wert  focuses
on the year in which Lee first took command of the traitorous Confederate Army bent on splittingasunder the United States forever, leading it to one victory after another. Wert's prose is accessible andclear. But these battle-by-battle accounts, along with his carefully judged opinions backed up by quotingfrom diaries and letters at the time or memoirs written later and other sources, will delight mostly thosewho savor every twist and turn of battle or debating the what-if of Glendale (where a mortal blow mighthave been struck against the Union Army). Wert's judgments are sober and convincing. He also paints a
picture from the start of a military campaign that was ultimately doomed by forces beyond the control of
Lee or any General. (The North's advantages in factories and men, to name two.) It might appeal to onemore audience. Anyone who insists on calling this event The War Between The States might very wellenjoy a book that records one triumph after another and ends with Lee's victory at Chancellorsville.

THE CIVIL WAR: COMMEMORATIVE EDITION  ($99.99; PBS) -- It's only fitting that the most
wrenching event in US history should inspire one of the most important works in television. The Civil
War  by Ken Burns is simply a landmark, an epic of documentary filmmaking that has inspired virtually
every work that has come in its wake and -- let's not forget -- exceptionally entertaining. You were surely
reminded of that if you watched even a minute when it was rebroadcast last week. Just seeing a moment
can suck you right back in again. Yes, it's educational and informative and rigorous in its scholarship. But
it's also funny, tense, exciting, tear-inducing and inspiring, both as art and for making clear what a noble
cause the war truly was. It may have been tragic and painful on personal levels, but it was also our
nation's defining hour. And nothing captures that better than this film.
