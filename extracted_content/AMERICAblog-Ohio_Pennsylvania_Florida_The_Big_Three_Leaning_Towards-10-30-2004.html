10/30/2004 03:04:00 PMKERRY!! For the first time in the entire election, the LA Timeselectoral college map shows Kerry leading Bush in Ohio,Pennsylvania, and Florida. For months, we've been told thatwhichever candidate wins two out of three of them will be tough tobeat. I check the map almost every day -- it's really addictive fun toplay around with the possibilities, since you can give any state toeither candidate and thus toy with all sorts of possibilities -- andwhile it's been trending towards Kerry for a while, this is the FIRSTTIME the latest polls that the LA Times use all give Kerry the edge. InOhio, it's a six point lead, in Pennsylvania it's a five point lead, and inFlorida it's only a one point lead (well within the margin of error, ofcourse), but still -- Kerry is leading in all three.
