            <p>Coffeehouses: 
The New 
Generation .</p>
<p>By Michael Giltz 
Pop music can be frightfully dull. Hit 
singles are played ad nauseam over the 
airwaves and on MTV. Eventually, even the 
songs you originally liked become tiresome 
and mundane. 
Most bar bands also must resign them­
selves to playing covers of those very same 
Top 40 hits. The precious few that do get a 
chance to play original music often compete 
with noisy crowds and people who, when 
thinking of licks, do not think of guitars. 
The person longing for direct contact 
with an artist, the person who is searching 
for meaningful music, the' person who 
thinks thrash is trash, must think there is no 
hope. 
But there is. 
Tucked away in various corners of 
Gainesville is a string of coffeehouses; pla­
ces where musicians can share their music 
with small, intimate, interested crowds. The 
emphasis is on acoustic music and the 
atmosphere is laid back and friendly. 
Unencumbered by disinterested drinkers 
and commercial pressures, coffeehouses are 
Gainesville's alternative to alternative 
music. 
On any given night, you're likely to hear 
everything from folk and rock classics to 
traditional Irish jigs -all spiced with 
healthy doses of original songs penned by 
the performers . 
"The performers really seem to enjoy 
playing there. So, of course, that makes 
their performance all the better," said Doug 
Hornbeck, who frequently goes to the 
Acrosstown Coffeehouse . 
Established about three years ago, the 
Acrosstown Coffeehouse is the' longest­
running and best-attended coffeehouse in 
town. On the first Sunday of every month, 
musicians perform for about 50-100 people 
on the stage of the Acrosstown Repertory 
Theatre. 
Located at 619 South Main Street in the· 
Baird Center, the Acrosstown requests a but also because we all enjoy playing

is intended as a fund-raiser for the center, 
which is run on "a shoestring and a prayer," 
the musicians donate their services freely. 
The goal of the Reunion Peace Center is 
to promote the idea of the internal peace 
movement as a necessary prerequisite for 
the external peace movement. Simply put, 
they believe that men must be at ease with 
themselves before they can deal effectively 
with the world around them. 
"It's a real easy place to offer your 
music," Beede said. "The audience is open­
hearted and friendly." 
Like the Acrosstown Coffeehouse, the 
Reunion Peace Center features 15-20 
minute sets featuring artists of various sty­
les, with the rest of the evening open to any 
musician who wishes to play. Beede thinlcs 
this format is ideal. 
"If someone's great, you're left wanting 
more," he explained. "If someone's not so 
great, well, you know they'll be gone in a 
few minutes." 
As of now, the Reunion Peace Center 
Coffeehouse is strictly "open mike." Any 
musician who arrives early and signs up is 
given a chance to play. But, according to 
Beede, the coffeehouse is considering a 
change in format that would allow it to 
devote half an evening to "open mike" and 
half an evening to a featured act. 
Judging from the support in the local 
community , the coffeehou ses are fulfilling 
an important function. The Acrosstown 
Coffeehouse has a mailing lisr with more 
than 200 names and it grows every day. 
"People will go out of their way to see it," 
said Bob Freeman, a production manager 
and one of the founders of the Acrosstown 
Repertory Theatre. 
"Of course, there isn't as much acoustic 
music on campus as there used to be," noted 
Alan Agresti, business manager of the 
Acrosstown Coffeehouse . "Ten or 15 years 
ago, you could walk across campus and find 
people playing music all along the way." 
Because of this absence, Agresti felt cer­
tain "there was a real need for this type of 
music." 
A visit to Acrosstown on the first Sunday 
of any month bears him out. The theater is 
buzzing with a crowd of people, many of 
whom are regulars and know each other. 
"The atmosphere is very warm and 
friendly," Hornbeck said. "The audiences 
are friendly to the performers and each 
other." 
Musicians sit with friends and welI­
wishers until their set. Encouraging banter. 
often passes between the crowd and the 
performers. Their positive attitudes, 
coupled with Acrosstown's intimate sur­
roundings ; make you feel perfectly lit ease, 
as if you were sitting in someone's living 
room and listening to a friend pick out a 
tune on the guitar.

Rucker agrees. "The coffeehouse is the

Thanks to recent growth, the Acrosstown 
Coffeehouse is becoming even more ambi­
tious. Having incorporated, Agresti said it 
recently applied for status as 'a non-profit 
organization. 
"Eventually," Agresti said. "we bope to 
sponsor concert series similar to tbose done 
by the Gainesville Friends of Jazz." 
As for the moment, the coffeehouses are 
offering their small but loyal audiences 
something they can't find anywbere else. 
And, 'as Hoovler said, there's no lack of 
talented local artists wbo are ready and 
eager to perform. 
"I've never been to a place witb more 
musicians, .. he said. . 
"In. some cities, tbere's one musician for 
every 10 potential audience members. But, 
in Gainesville, it seems like there are 10 
musicians to every one audience 
member."
