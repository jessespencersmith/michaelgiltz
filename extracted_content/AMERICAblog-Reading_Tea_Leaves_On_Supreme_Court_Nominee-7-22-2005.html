7/22/2005 12:56:00 PMThe NYT looks at the brief judicial career of Judge Roberts. Theverdict? He ain't no Sandra Day O'Connor.In some ways, said Richard H. Pildes, a law professor atNew York University, Judge Roberts's approach mostresembles that of Justice Antonin Scalia."Like Scalia," Professor Pildes said, "he appears to becommitted to a strong priority to the texts of statutes. Andthat might extend to the texts of the Constitution."One theme that emerges from Judge Roberts's decisions iswide deference to executive power, at least whereCongress has authorized it.But this comment from Sen. Specter in an article about the need forRoberts to be forthcoming is what struck me.As he makes the rounds of senators who will decide hisfate, Judge John G. Roberts has been noncommittal aboutthe kinds of questions he will answer during hisconfirmation hearings, but has said that if confirmed to theSupreme Court, he will place a high emphasis on "modesty"and "stability.""I considered his comments on modesty and stabilityto be highly significant," Senator Arlen Specter,Republican of Pennsylvania and the chairman of the SenateJudiciary Committee, said Thursday, recounting a one-hoursession Wednesday that ranged across the legal landscape,including whether Supreme Court hearings should betelevised and how much leeway the courts should take ininterpreting acts of Congress.Isn't this a little ridiculous? We're deciding whether to give someone alifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and senators are trying todecipher gnomic utterances of the nominee? Is it too much to hopethat a nominee could be honest and straightforward about his judicialphilosophy, speak cogently about landmark Supreme Court decisionsand the sort of judge he'd like to be? Why should we be analyzing hisevery utterance like Kreminologists who studied photos to see whowas in and out in Moscow? It's absurd, frankly.
