8/20/2005 11:08:00 AMNow this is rich: incompetent Defense Secretary DonaldRumsfeld traveled through South America warning about "themenace Cuba and Venezuela pose to the region." Now puttingaside the stupidity of lecturing leftist governments to avoidother leftist governments (is Rumsfeld tone deaf?), the BushAdministration has a LOT of nerve claiming the democraticallyelected leader of oil-rich Venezuela is a threat to democracy.Bush of course gave a thumbs up to a military coup in thatcountry just because he didn't like that nation's popular leader.How can Bush even pretend he wants to promote democracywhen he's never apologized for saying a military coup was fineby him? How can Bush claim he loves democracy when two ofhis closest allies in the war on terror are Saudi Arabia (theworld's biggest financial supporter of terrorism and religiousextremism) and Pakistan (the world's biggest seller of WMDmaterial and know-how to terrorists and rogue states)? Whatgall.
