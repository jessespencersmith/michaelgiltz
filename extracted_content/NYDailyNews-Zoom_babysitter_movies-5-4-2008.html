club
ure, moms and dads love their kids. But
every parent needs a break from the lit-
tle monsters now and then, which is why
they often tuln to baby-sitters and nannles.
As does Hollywood. The sitter ls a stranger dropped
smack dab in the middle of a family - and just the
sort of chalacter to set off a chain reaction of events.
I In "The Babysitters," opening Friday, a teen sitter be
gins offering a father some "extra" services - and then
opens a calFgirl business, Maly Poppins, she ain't,
From sweet to sexy to psychotic, here are some of
Hoffywood's favorite kids' caregivers. Mlchael Gtltz
ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING (I987)
Ite Nilrry: Elisabeth Shue plays every kid's dream baby-sitter, a cute teenager who brings them
along on an unintentionally wild night where they run across everything from carjackers to
homicidal tow-truck drivers and god-like mechanics (Vincent D'onofrio).
Did She Eam a Tip? Absolutely, if only from drunken bar patrons after Shue and crew stumble
on stage in a nightclub and she belts out a song about having the baby-sitting blues
MARY POPPINS (1964)
The llanny: Practically perfect in every way, Mary Poppins is perhaps the most famous baby-
sitter of all and wd embodied with icy, steely (but secretly friendly) efficiency by Julie Andrews
in her Oscar-winning role.
Did she Eam a llp? N.4ary Poppins does NoT take tips (a job well-done is thanks enough) But
reawakening N,4r. Banks to what really matters most in life certainly deserved one
T}.{E HAND TI{AT ROCKS THE
CRADLE (I992) F
The Ndlrtc Every picked-on kid has dreamed oI a
nanny like the frightenrng Peyton Flanders (Rebecca
De Mornay), who makes Tony Soprano seem timid
when she smacks dowf a schoolyard bully.
Did she Effi a Tip? No Secretly breast-feeding the
family's newborn is innovative, but not appreciated
Not to mcntion terrorizing the baby's mother
< THREE MEN AND A BABY
fl987)
The Nilny: Swinging bachelors Tom Selleck, Ted
Danson and Steve Guttenberg see their iootloose
days come to an end when a baby pops up on their
doorstep. 0iapers are fumbled, but hearts melt
when they croon a lullaby-
Did They Eam a Tip? Not nccessary, since
nurturing the Iittle cutie gave them all the reward
they needed (and chicks dig sensitive guys)
MRS. DOUBTFTRE (r993)
The Nnny: This was never covered in divorce court: An estranged dad (Robin Williams) dresses
up as Mrs Euphegenia Doubtnre so hc can spend quality time with his kids. sabotaging his ex-
wife's romantic life is just a bonus,
Did she/He Effi a Tip? Yes, because the
boyfriend (a pre-o07 Pierce Brosnan) was a jerk.
THE WORLD ACCORDING TO
GARP (1982) >
The Nanny: A string of teenage girls provide day
care for the children of carp (Williams agJin.
in a role he would never top) - and a constant
source of temptatiofl when he drives thern home
Oid They Eam a Tip? Those hurricd assignations
cn lhe side of the road certainly deserved nlore
