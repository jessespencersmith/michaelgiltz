It was movie night on American Idol  and Crystal
Bowersox appeared in her own production of A Star Is
(Re)Born . After a few weeks of showing "another side"
to herself (sides that weren't that gripping), she got
back down to business with a bluesy spin on the
Kenny Loggins tune "I'm Alright" and a great duet
with Lee Dewyze on "Falling Slowly" from the indiefilm Once . Any questions as to whether she would
make it to the winner's circle are over. Vegas, stop the
betting; Crystal will win it. The only suspense is how
good will she be in getting there. Will it be by defaultor will she rise to the occasion and wow us?
Lee Dewyze should thank his lucky stars he got to duet with Crystal. It put him in the best light in weeksand gives him a leg up on joining her in the finale in two weeks.
Jamie Foxx was the guest mentor. He focused mainly on getting up in the contestant's faces, forcing them
to sing right to him as he stood inches away from their face. While he got across just one basic idea, it didseem to loosen them up a bit. Foxx also cleverly allowed himself a vote alongside the judges by bringing t-
shirts that read "Contestant" and "Artist" and choosing who deserved what.
LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang the Seal tune "Kiss From A Rose" from Batman Forever,  the best song from the
franchise, which appeared in the worst film of them all, by far. Lee was fine but not commanding. How
far can a raspy voice take him? Kara oddly said "Kiss From A Rose" is one of the the hardest songs tosing. It may not be the easiest but surely it's far from the hardest.
MICHAEL LYNCHE  -- Sang Michael Jackson's "Will You Be There" from Free Willy.  Randy chided
him for not choosing an r&b song. Huh? It has gospel overtones, but it's definitely r&b. Michael was a tad
better than Lee in a performance that was filled with runs and riffs and other vocalizing acrobatics.

Ryan Seacrest:
Simon Cowell Was
Jealous Of...CRYSTAL BOWERSOX AND LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang "Falling Slowly" from Once . Now this actually
is a very tricky song to sing. The chorus is anthemic and moving, but the verses can drag if the singers are
even slightly out of tune. (I've heard the original artists stumble over it once or twice.) But Lee andCrystal strapped on guitars, faced each other, and did it very very well. They blended perfectly, withCrystal coming off light and sweet (as opposed to her usually bluesy mama) and Lee proving much better
at connecting one on one than to an audience. Sterling.
CASEY JAMES  -- Sang Simon & Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson" from The Graduate.  It seemed like a
desperate choice and practically begged the judges to waste time joshing with Kara -- which they did. The
actual performance was pretty good, with Casey on mandolin, though his vibrato is still as wide as Texas.He just doesn't look confident whenever he's not performing and often doesn't look confident even whenhe is. Plus the song and the arrangement are way out of his Stevie Ray Vaughan wheelhouse. Why stray at
this stage? He should have rocked out, especially since his other tune was a ballad. Bad choice.
CRYSTAL BOWERSOX  -- Sang "I'm Alright" from Caddyshack . The tune was more defiant in her
hands and certainly bluesier. As Ellen said, she actually made the song better. Her on guitar with just the
percussionist (and the backup singers upstairs) kept the focus visually on her, which was smart. A light
pop song suddenly sounded personal and meaningful. Not out of the ballpark but quite strong and far
better than the last few weeks.
MICHAEL LYNCHE AND CASEY JAMES  -- Sang "Have You Ever Loved A Woman" from Don Juan
DeMarco,  a Bryan Adams tune I have a particular weakness for. (Hey, it's a great melody.) They're
fighting for third place and I'd say it was basically a draw, with Michael evincing a tad more personality.
The judges went over the top with their praise, though it certainly was better than their solo slots. Plus, it
did give Ellen the line of the night when she responded to the musical question "Have you ever loved a
woman?" with a friendly "yep." Yes, it's a new world.
Michael and Casey will be in the bottom two with Casey going home. But it's a toss-up. So who do you
think is going home? And do you agree Crystal is flying to the finish?

I have watched every American Idol. This was the most boring season. I can tell that Crystal from
the start was naturally talented, and she looks like a musician and has a beautiful smile. Lee is also

Lambert came in second, it was because of the young teens that voted for Chris. The same mayhappen with Lee since he is a cute guy. I loved their duet and had to watch it 3 times.
The best moment of the evening was the Crystal/Le e duet, hands down. They did a great job with
it. After that, preferred Michael Lynche's solo to anything else. His duet with Casey was ok, but
there were a couple of glaring pitch problems in the harmonies. The rest of the solos were a littleblah and weird for song choices.
Again, I'm looking at this and thinking how truly weak this season has been as compared to past
seasons. At this stage, we expect to see some really great performanc es from the Final Four. It's
just not happening.
Mike tonight--C asey next week and I think it is still a toss up on who wins....
I agree with your call. Crystal will win, with Lee in second place.
I think I'm finally over Idol. I watched it this year, because I've watched it every year since the
second. But this year there is no breakout star. It's been fun to watch people grow into the role overthe years, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Adam Lambert, and others, who havegone from somebody off the street to somebody standing on stage with a commanding stagepresence, whether they win or not, it's fun to watch them grow. But it just seems lacking this year.The remaining contestant s can sing, but I don't see any one of them as someone I would listen to
on the radio. I don't see anybody filling the 'star' role.
Steve, I totally agree with you.
Lee has a great future, Crystal will be the top,she will have a great career verytalented young lady
