8/18/2005 03:00:00 AMGee, you think? My favorite lines from the NYT:Some said that the perception that the war wasfaltering was providing a rallying point for dispiritedDemocrats and could pose problems for Republicans in theCongressional elections next year...."There is just no enthusiasm for this war," saidRepresentative John J. Duncan Jr., a Tennessee Republicanwho opposes the war. "Nobody is happy about it. Itcertainly is not going to help Republican candidates, I cantell you that much."Really, what is wrong with kids these days when they can't getenthusiastic about war?And what's with claiming there's a "perception" things aren't goingwell? Could that "perception" be based on news like this:Three car bombs exploded Wednesday in quick successionin and around a crowded bus station in Baghdad, killing atleast 43 people, injuring 88 and paralyzing one ofIraq's most important transportation networks.
