By MICHAEL rdNE
DO the Golden Globes
ntatter?
Let's be honest, no star is
Oscar level enthrrsed about
winning a Globe. No matter
how many tears you see.
The Hollywood Foreign
Press, a relatively tiny
ilssemblage of foreign
journalists with dubious
credentials, is bardly the last
word in cinematic taste
So tomorrow night is really
more of a practice run for stars
- ifyou can make it through
your long list of thank-yous at
the Globes, you'll be less
ncrvous when it comcs to thc
Academy (if you should l.e so
luckry as to win, that is)
To its credit, the Globes has
always made up what it lacked
in irnport in spontaneit)', letting
the Champagne flgw freel-v and
the stars ramble intcrrninably
onstage.
In the past few years, thorrgh,
that one key advantage has
been notably lacking.
The once-boozy and
unpredictable Globes have
become more of a rehearsed
campaigr stop - where all bul
laid-back legends like Jack
Nicholson and Mcryl Streep
arrive at the show with an
agenda
"The Globes have becorne ir
showcase," says David P0land,
rvho pels the Hollywood nust-
r cad Internet colurnn The HOt
IJutton "HoE sorneoDc
performs in an rcceptance
speech can sway Academy
voters."
Globe critics cite thc
orgirnization's size and
unprot'essional strtus as marks
rgainst them. Whc'reas the
Academy consists of 6,000
insiders in the movie industry
who vote in their area of
expertise (directinF, score,
etc.). the Globes are
decided by tbe 90-
odd rnembcrs of
the fi-eebie-
Ioving HFPA
"There's not
really any
cachet to
wrnnrng a
Golden GIobe
that will
affect your
Oscar
chances,"
Poland sa1's.
'Academy
voters navc
segn the
films and
probably aJreacly
uradc up their
minds
"For example,
cveryone savs'Br0keback Mourtain' is
unstoppable this ycrr, right?"
continues Poland "But thcre
nrc a lot oIover-5O Acadcny
votcrs I've talkcd to who arcn't
s0 rcady to md<c'this the'gay
Oscars "
But, Poland poiDts out,
there's always the human
elemcnt thar - mrlrc oftcn
than not fucled hy thc frcc
boozc and roonful of rrmpant
egotism - could turn things ir
a Globe winner's flvor come
(Jscar trme
"Let's say Heath Ledger is at
the Globes with his wife
lMichelle Williams.) aud nayb
their new baby, then hc wins
rnd sheds a tear during his
acceptaDce speech - suddenll
it's not a gay movie anymorc,
It's family-friendly."
Similarly, a thankful and
poised Terrencc Lloward may
he able to use thc (;lobes as a
platform to win Ovcr rehlctant
voters t0 "Huslle & I'lot'," a
movie about an innc'r-city
prmp
"The Academy wants to feel
comfortable in thinking their
pick will bc revercnt in
accepting the awrrd," Poland
srrys "Which, as funny as he
was at the Globes two years
ago, probably worked against
Bill Murray'.
"He was joking around,
having a lau51h at thc whole
thing Thal rnight lrave cost hi:
