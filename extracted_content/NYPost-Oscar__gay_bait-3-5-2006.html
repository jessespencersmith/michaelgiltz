I playing a real person is always
I in fashion: Think Ben Kings-

incorporating some kind of a
physical or mental handicap, like
Geoflfrey Rush in "Shine" or
Daniel-Day Lcwis in "My Left
Foot "
Now that gay characters are
more open than ever in the
movies especially with
"Brokeback Mountain" and
"Capote" Ieading this ycar's field

black for actors and actresses irr
