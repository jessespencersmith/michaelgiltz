A rundown of what 
• was up on movIe screens 
around the country 
By MICHAEL GILTZ Hollyw(xJd has otten been por-
. trayed as the Sodom and Gomor­
rah of the West, a seedy town 
where crafty businessmen scratch 
and claw their way to the top of the 
cinematic heap. But righteous 
anger was nowhere to be found in 
1987. 
In fact, someone up there must 
really like them, because it was a 
banner year by any standards . The 
critics were kind -even to some 
of the blockbusters. Hollywood 
honchos were happy; they raked in Above: lone Skye andKean uReeves portrayed listless.

more money than ever. Audiences 
were delighted; they clamored for 
tickets and flocked to a wide 
variety of films in near-record 
numbers. 
First, the box office. The studios 
pulled in $4.2 billion last year -
the largest gross in history. Ironic­
ally, 1987 was also the year more 
money was made from the sale 
and rental of videocassettes than 
from tickets at the local theaters. 
The technology that had Holly­
wood so foolishly worried (just as record companies are foolishly 
worried about Digital Audio 
Tape) has become a raging success 
-getting older audiences excited 
about movies again and creating 
an income safety net that has 
propelled independent film 
makers to the highest level of 
production in modern history. 
Even the critics were happy. 
When it came time to compile a 
Top-10 list, we bandied about a 
good 20 titles before settling on 
the ones in the box on your ri ht.</p>
<p>That's a far cry from years past 
when we've had to scrape around 
for 10 titles (and most of them 
were foreign films). 
Speaking of foreign films, our 
favorite of the year was My Life A.r 
A Dog, a wry, observant Swedish 
film about one summer in the life 
of a young boy. ) 
Also worthy of mention are a 
few movies that didn't make our 
list. Swimming To Cambodia was 
a hilarious monologue filmed by 
Jonathan Demme. This time there , TWf.NTlf.TH Cf.NTIiRY FOX 
Above: Albert Brooks, Holly Hunter and William Hurt are the three 
points of a romantic triangle that teeters precariously throughout

tense conspiracy caper No WaJ,Oltt. 
was ()nly one talking head, but it 
belonged to Spalding Gray, and he 
was terrific. The Big Ea.ry had the 
best sex scene of the year COh, 
come on, sugah. Don't be ner­
vous."), and Talllpopo had the 
funniest. 
As for the list itself, everything 
on it is highly recommended and 
well worth renting. A few you 
might not be familiar with are 
Ril'er'J /:'dge, a harrowing drama 
about morally empty teens, and 
PerJ(ma/ Sert'ice.r, a funny but very serious British film about prosti­
tution, 
And then there's Tbree O'Clock 
Higb, a wildly entertaining com­
edy about a high school student 
terrorized by a bully. It was bril­
liantly directed by Phil Joanu. It 
enjoyed the stamp ()f approval of 
Steven Spielberg, It was promoted 
well by Universal. And it opened 
to resounding indifference. This 
just goes to show that even in a 
banner year making movies is a 
roll of the dice, BEST BEST MOVIES
