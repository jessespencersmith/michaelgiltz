 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: New Broadway Musical
Lysistrata Jones  An Air Ball
"LYSISTRATA JONES"  * out of ****
WALTER KERR THEATRE
This thin idea for a sketch on Saturday Night Live  -- much less a full-fledged musical -- has an appealing
if generally vocally challenged cast let down by the book of award-winning playwright Douglas Carter
Beane ( Sister Act ) and the music and lyrics of his collaborator (both professionally and personally) Lewis
Flinn. This is surely one of the first if not the first time an openly gay couple has created a Broadway
musical. Sadly, that happy bit of trivia is the most memorable thing about the show.
The story is a spin on the Greek play by Aristophanes in which women strive to end the Peloponnesian
War by withholding sexual favors until their men stop fighting. In our show, new college studentLysistrata Jones (Patti Murin) starts dating basketball player Mick (Josh Segarra) but is, like, totallybummed he and the other guys on the team don't really try. They've lost every game this season (andpretty much every game as long as anyone can remember). Before you can say Buffy, the bubblyLysistrata recruits the other girlfriends of the athletes to proclaim "No More Giving It Up" until the guysactually triumph. Instead of stopping fighting, these girls want their men to start  fighting, or at least
caring  about whether they win. Ultimately, the message of the show is that negatively insisting "no sex
until you win" isn't nearly as powerful as inspiring them with love, but it's a long road to get there.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>Along the way, we meet two non-cheerleaders and non-jocks: librarian Robin (Lindsay Nicole Chambers,
doing her level best) who delivers "hilarious" spoken word poetry slams and announces her attraction to
Lysistrata (though that idea is immediately dropped) and nerdy social activist Xander (the cute Jason
Tam, presumably named in tribute to the character in Buffy The Vampire Slayer ). He seems like a gay
character and you assume he'll fall for one of the guys on the team, but this too is a misdirection sinceXander falls for Lysistrata.
It's all presided over by Hetaira, a Greek goddess of sorts who also doubles as the madam of a whore
house the girls turn to for practical advise and the guys turn to for release when the pressure gets too
much. Liz Mikel plays this dual role and despite several unflattering costumes and a character that makes
you cringe with its "winking" cliched nature, Mikel through sheer stage presence and charm (and some
real pipes) somehow manages to maintain her dignity.
The same could be said for the rest of the cast. Cindy Tolan is the casting director and while almost no
one here other than Mikel has a strong voice, they are uniformly appealing as actors and comics. Star
Patti Murin was an understudy on Xanada  (which Tolan cast and Beane wrote the book for) and that's
no surprise. Just like Kerry Butler, Murin is a delightful personality who holds the stage with ease and
makes this foolishness almost seem worthwhile. She's no belter but her voice has a charm in the quietmoments. You can easily see Murin on TV, film and stage comedies. Segarra is weaker in the singing(though also not bad in his one quiet song "When She Smiles") and the book doesn't allow him to reallycreate a convincing jock who is a closet lover of poetry. But Segarra has charisma and would have made agood Sweathog in the days of Welcome Back, Kotter -- he plays dumb, but lovable very nicely.
Tam has an even worse role, usually saddled with the joke costume of the team mascot. In his big number
"Hold On," Tam is saddled with ridiculous hand gestures that make it look as if he's interpreting for the
blind. He too is not much of a singer but you imagine he deserves better material as an actor. Alexander
Aguilar is by far the best dancer, nicely demonstrated in the song "Lay Low," the closest director and
choreographer Dan Knechtges comes to mixing street moves, basketball and traditional Broadway
dancing into an interesting mix.
In fairness, poor tunes are hard to build interesting dances around and after two viewings it's still hard to
remember any of the musical numbers. They're performed very quietly and without any sense of rockingout by the house band, which may be keeping the volume down so as not to drown out the modest voicesof the cast. The book is essentially the same as the production that leaped from The Gym at Judson  to
Broadway, with I think a few modest additions like a joke about the iPhone service Siri and a NewtGingrinch reference.
About the only interesting element of the show's earlier incarnation was that it was performed in an
actual gym. Switching to Broadway hasn't been a problem for set designer Allen Moyer but a row of
lockers and some hoops don't exactly wow with their creativity. He and lighting designer Michael Gottlieb
have added a bank of bright lights at the back of the stage (a la Dreamgirls ) that is seen at the beginning,
partially revealed at the end of Act One and fully revealed for the finale. It adds a little pizazz but clashes
horribly with the gym setting and the overall effect is pedestrian. The costumes by David C. Woolard andThomas Charles LeGalley are fine for the students though again not as regal or sexy as Mikel deserves.On a side note, the ball control of the cast is vastly improved. Before, it seemed unlikely any of them hadever even watched a basketball game, much less played one. Across the board, they're much improvedand the audience doesn't need to spend its time worrying about whether they can hold onto the ball.
It's a pity this show rushed to Broadway though, to be fair, they were misled by summertime reviews that
seized on the play as a pleasant diversion and vastly oversold its appeal. A second mounting on a smallerscale would have given cooler heads a chance to prevail. But the economics of theater in New York City atthe moment mean the risk to reward of Off Broadway just doesn't compute. That's not to say LysistrataJones  would work better in a smaller house. It didn't work in the tiny space below Washington Square
Park and it doesn't work here. It simply should have been mounted (and genuinely worked on, ratherthan merely coasting on what they had) so everyone involved could realize there wasn't much there beforethe stakes and cost rose so high. It's always good to try your best, but sometimes you have to recognizewhen the game is over and that putting in more effort won't change the final score.
