From the Publisher: In 1947, Forbes magazine declared Lancaster, Ohio
the epitome of the all-American town. Today it is damaged, discouraged,and fighting for its future. In Glass House , journalist Brian Alexander uses
the story of one town to show how seeds sown 35 years ago have sproutedto give us Trumpism, inequality, and an eroding national cohesion. TheAnchor Hocking Glass Company, once the world's largest maker of glasstableware, was the base on which Lancaster's society was built. As GlassHouse unfolds, bankruptcy looms. With access to the company and its
leaders, and Lancaster's citizens, Alexander shows how financialengineering took hold in the 1980s, accelerated in the 21st Century, andwrecked the company. We follow CEO Sam Solomon, an African-Americanleading the nearly all-white town's biggest private employer, as he tries
to rescue the company from…

What We Say
What happened to the heartland of America, the small towns that were once the backbone of the country and now seem
like its biggest problem, thanks to crumbling factories and the plague of opioid addiction? Journalist Brian Alexander looksat his home town of Lancaster, Ohio, a place Forbes magazine once dubbed the "Norman Rockwell ideal" of small town life.
Lancaster was anchored quite literally by the Anchor Hocking factory that made glass baking trays and measuring cups and
glasses and other well-made items you could find in every household in America. He gently makes clear that the town --once proudly known as the whitest city in America -- wasn't so idyllic for everyone. Women looking to work outside theShare This Book

<p>home, people of color, Catholics and so on weren't exactly popular (and gays weren't even acknowledged at all). Still all in
all it was pretty good for the people who were visible, from blue collar workers to top executives. Business leaders and
factory workers might belong to the same social club and drink in the same bars. Everyone knew everyone else and the
town proudly and wisely invested in itself by building a good hospital and hotel and schools and the such -- and byinvesting, we mean raise taxes. Alexander shows how that all fell apart in a decades-long tale that jumps back and forthfrom the hollowed-out community of today (including drug addicts and weakened unions and disheartened cops) to thevagaries of the past. It's almost comical how every ill of past years is visited on the town like a plague, from Carl Icahn
greenmailing the "glass house" factory into forking over tons of money to corporate raiders and private equity firms that
don't even have the decency to split it up and sell it off. They just show up, take over, pay themselves to consult and walkaway with tons of cash while leaving a decent business over-burdened with debt. Then someone else comes in, demandsmore worker concessions and does the same thing all over again. Alexander keeps widening his scope. He looks atcorporations run by people who have no roots in the town their company is based in to malignant businesses that feed off
poverty, like pay-day loan sharks to discount stores. He watches as judges chide addicts for personal failings while the wife
of the mayor is jailed for embezzlement and then gambling away the stolen funds. Frankly, the story loses its focus timeand again, with the scope becoming so broad that it all becomes fuzzy, like a scene in a movie in which the camera pullsback and back again, farther and farther away until you can't really see anything. Lengthy chapters detailing the dizzying
financial firms raping and pillaging their way through Anchor Hocking are followed by a scene with one of the people
Alexander tracks for years. But the main effect is that you'd almost forgotten about this or that person when they pop upagain. His righteous anger is searing and his reportage is vivid and detailed. If the story gets away from him by the end, it'sa poignant echo of how a functioning community has escaped the grasp of Lancaster and perhaps America as well. --Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Brian Alexander's Glass House  reads more like a great novel. But I've driven by the Anchor Hocking plant (the
Glass House of the title) at least several times a year since the mid-70s and seen its decay firsthand. Glass
House  is a fascinating, multi-layered, and superbly written account of how politics, corporate greed, low wages,
and the recent heroin epidemic have nearly destroyed a once prosperous Midwestern city. This is a must read for
anyone interested in really understanding the anger and frustration of blue collar workers and the middle class inAmerica today." âDonald Ray Pollock, author of The Heavenly Table and The Devil All the Time
"So few journalists today spend time in America's small towns, even though the people residing in them representroughly half of the American population. In his remarkably nuanced Glass House , Brian Alexander gives readers
an imbedded, close-up view of one iconic Ohio town -- his hometown -- that illuminates the lives that most
politicians and urban dwellers seem to have forgotten. Part sociological study and part investigative business
reporting, this book should be required reading for people trying…
