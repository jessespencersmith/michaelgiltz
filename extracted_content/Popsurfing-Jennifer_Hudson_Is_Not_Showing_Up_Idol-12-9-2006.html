            <p>S AT U R D AY,  D E C E M B E R  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6Jennifer Hudson Is Not Showing Up "Idol"Despite the fact that Jennifer Hudson wisely, politely (and correctly)says "American Idol" was a huge boost to her, the media now wants tosay that Hudson's triumph in "Dreamgirls" shows up "Idol" for gettingit wrong. That's ridiculous. (Though in fairness to them, Hudsonsometimes says her rejection by Simon spurred her on to have morehunger and drive, which is not the same point that I'm making.) In fact,Hudson is the latest example of how stunnigly effective "Idol" has beenat uncovering real, lasting talent. Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood,Clay Aiken, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard and Kellie Pickler (who mayhave her biggest success with a sitcom) are just the first names thatcome to mind. Every season has spawned a NUMBER of artists whohave received a chance to record albums, have hit singles and get abetter shot at glory than 99.9% of the people who sign a record deal.And an astonishing number of them are proving to be more thanflashes in the pan. But even if they fail, "Idol" is getting them a shot.And even if they don't win their particular season (like Clay andJennifer Hudson), that doesn't mean the show "failed." Hudsonreached the Top 10 after auditioning along with tens if not hundreds ofthousands of people. The judges winnowed that massive group down to10 or so people and one of them was Hudson. Then America takes over.Hudson didn't win but "Idol" deserves all the credit in the world forpicking her out of the lineup, along with Fantasia, who has a secondalbum just out that got better reviews than the first and indicates shetoo might very well be an artist in it for the long haul. Hudson isn'tproof "Idol" got it wrong because she wasn't the final winner. Hudsonis proof "Idol" got it right because they plucked her out of obscurity.Talent will out? Not always; you need a lucky break sometimes. AndHudson would not be the star of "Dreamgirls" today if the "Idol" judgeshadn't spotted her talent first.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
