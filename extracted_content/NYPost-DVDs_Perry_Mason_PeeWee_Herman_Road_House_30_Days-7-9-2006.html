30 Days: 
Season One 
*** 
~x.$26.98 
MORGAN Spurlock. 
the crcator of "Super 
Size Me." turns his 
attention to reality TV with 
intelligent results, People 
spend 30 days in some<Jne 
else's shoes -well-off folk 
trying to survive on 
minimum-wage jobs; a 
devout Christian living in a 
Muslim community, and so 
on. Extras include "diaries" 
by the participants. 
Perry Mason: 
Season 1, Vol. 1 
**'/' Paramount, $49.99 
LONG before DNA and other 
high-tech advances, Perry' 
Mason served as the silver 
bullet of justice. Villains on 
the stand inevitably coughed 
up startling confessions 
under his withering cross­
examination . Raymond Burr 
became such a star, he could 
spend his next series 
("Ironside") sitting down. No 
extras -just 19 episodes. 
Electric Edwardians 
*** Milestone. $29.95 
THESE brief documentary 
shorts from the early 1900s 
are exceedingly ordinary: 
factory workers leaving work, 
schoolchildren walking, a 
lempenlnce march and olher 
scenes of daily life. But they 
offer a glimpse of life more 
than 100 years ago, helped 
tremendously by a supple 
score. Solid extra: A hislorian 
who puts these early 
filmmakers into context. 
ALSO OUT: Sharon Stone's 
shameless payday "Basic 
Instinct 2" (Sony, $26.96); the 
droll sitcom about a pot­
dealing mom 
called "Weeds: 
Season One" 
(Lionsgate, 
$39.98); and 
the delightful, 
all-embracing 
drama "Vi Vi" 
(Criterion; 
in "81;2," $39.95). 42

'" z The Pee-wee 
Herman Show: Uve 
at the Roxy Theater 
***'h Image, $14.99 
EVERYTHING'S coming up Pee· 
wee! Reruns of his sweet-natured 
but wickedly funny children's 
show have just started airing on 
Cartoon Networ1<'s Adult Swim, 
creator Paul Reubens has two 
film scripts starring Pee-wee 
ready to go, and now we finally 
get the DVD release of the 
hilarious stage show (and HBO 
special) that started it all. 
Weirdly wonderful. 
She's the Man 
*'1, 
~reamWorks, $2~5 
AMANDA Bynes (of TV's "All 
That") has an appealing, 
knockabout charm. Too bad this 
empty·headed spin on "Twelfth 
Night" -in which she poses as a 
boy so she can play soccer -
doesn't give her more to do than 
spit and groan about chicks. The 
finale is especially dumb. Extras 
include commentary and deleted 
scenes. 
Road House 
(Deluxe Edition) 
**'1, 
MGM, $19,94 -----
A GLORIOUSLY stupid B-movie 
about James Dalton (Patrick 
Swayze), the best bouncer in the 
biz, charged with cleaning up the 
Double Deuce, the toughest road 
house in America. Dumber than 
dumb, and proud of it. Loads of 
extras include a "What Would 
Dalton Do?" documentary and 
commentary from uber·fan 
director Kevin Smith. 
ALSO OUT: two landmark TV 
movies: AIDS Drama "An Early 
Frost" (Wolfe, $19.99) and "Sybil: 
30th Anniversary Edition" 
(Warner Bros .. $24.99); 
Oscar-winning South 
African film "Tsotsi" 
(Miramax, $29.99); 
cult TV western "The 
Adventures of 
Brisco County Jr,: 
Complete Series" 
(Warner Bros., 
$99.98); and the 
gayer-than-gay, 
straight·to-DVD 
animated musical 
"Queer Duck: The 
Movie" (Paramount, 
$19.99).</p>
