Earlier I posted aboutthe Disney Channel's TV movieHigh School Musical. It was amonster in the ratings and nowthe album is exploding on thecharts. Billboard just releasedmore facts on it. The album is inthe Top Ten and the soundtrackhas spawned eight tracks on theHot 100. Four make their debutthis week, another ("BreakingFree" by Zac Efron and VanessaAnne Hudgens -- pictured) jumps from 86 to 4, the biggest jump inBillboard history. Eight songs in total hit the charts -- they ranked at#4,#28, #34, #35, #43, #62, #67 and #72. Oh and it's almost allentirely due to digital download sales, which should put to rest thefears of record labels I talked about earlier.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

(Now I do that too.) But 8 singles on the Hot 100 at once iscrazy. I haven't been this tickled by a pop run like this since Madonnahad her amazing string of 16 Top 5 hits from '84 to '89.10:51 PM
