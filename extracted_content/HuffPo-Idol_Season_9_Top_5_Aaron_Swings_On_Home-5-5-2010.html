RESULTS NIGHT  -- Tim Urban can have the cover
of Tiger Beat.  Aaron Kelly probably has his sights set
on country music after saying goodbye to American
Idol . In Sinatra week, Aaron sang "Fly Me To The
Moon" and audiences sent him on permanent
vacation from the show. He was in the bottom two
with Michael Lynche and received the lowest amountof votes. Kelly will be on the Idol  tour, finish high
school (maybe) and then weigh the offers to become
the next Bryan White.
The show began with another dreaded group lip sync
sing-along with the contestants keeping the mikes
laughably high so they'd block their mouths and make
the lip-syncing less obvious. Interestingly, the numbers they soloed on probably would have been better
choices all around than the songs they sang on performance night. I did chuckle over Aaron singing the
line "When I was 17" from "It Was A Very Good Year" (and the album, September Of My Years , one of
Sinatra's great autumnal albums. It sounds melodramatic at first, especially if you're young. But as theyears pass, it becomes deeply moving. As a total Sinatra geek, I play it every year when September rolls
around. No wonder I'm single....)
Lee was asked what it was like to get complimented by the judges and rambled on for about ten minutes.
Dude, you need to rehearse your comments just like you rehearse your performance. Trust us, you don't
want to wing it.
Then Lady Gaga did her thing: a wonderfully evocative, theatrical live performance of "Alejandro"
(complete with bare-chested male dancers, fog, and a crazily eccentric costume) with the song almost anafterthought. Sometimes, she seems like Madonna without the catchy tunes. Harry Connick Jr. did a

<p>draggy "And I Love Her," from his latest album, a wan attempt to capture the lightning in a bottle that
Barry Manilow caught with his collection of pop classics. I appreciated Connick's attempt to take a light
breezy song, slow it down and give it some intensity. But for the most part it didn't work.
Then the kids did a medley of Connick Jr. songs, starting of course with his best original, by far, "We Are
In Love." More lip syncing and then we found out Connick is doing a stand on Broadway in July.
Michael Lynche and Aaron Kelly were in the bottom two and Aaron was sent home, head held high.
Nashville awaits Aaron; just give it a few weeks to dry out!
By the way, apparently there are people in this world who do NOT own Frank Sinatra's entire catalog. If
you're intrigued and want to know where to begin:
For ring-a-ding classics, jump on any of these upbeat gems: Songs For Swingin' Lovers, Come Fly With
Me, Come Dance With Me  or Sinatra At The Sands (and for heaven's sake, skip the monologues).
For quieter, darker masterpieces, dive into In The Wee Small Hours  (my favorite, at the moment), Only
The Lonely  and the new reissue of his bossa nova gems The Complete Sinatra-Jobim  ( written up nicely
by fellow HuffPoster Tony Sachs ).
This very selective list is what is known as scratching the surface. Then you've got the Christmas music,the pillowy perfection of the Columbia years, virtually everything from Capitol and on and on and on.
PERFORMANCE REVIEW  -- Idol  celebrated Frank Sinatra by swinging the standards. Harry Connick
Jr. was the mentor and rivals Adam Lambert as the best of the season. He sat in with the band, did the
arrangements, and put the singers at their ease while offering good advice. Heck, if he was more on top ofpop music as opposed to just jazz, he could be another great choice to replace Simon. (Ellen was also very
funny this week without letting it get in the way or feel like filler; she's come into her own the last two
weeks and while not a stellar analyst is a welcome, cheerleading presence.)
I wish they'd done standards week around the Top 10 or 9 because it's such a crap shoot of a night and
singing with strings and/or a big band is very very hard. At this stage, the singers should get to dig into
the genres they can nail.
The short video explaining Sinatra to the audience was godawful, by the way. Most of the clips showed
Sinatra in his much later years and it was a mishmash of random images and goofy asides; none of it
gave a sense of the impact he had on popular music. Sinatra just invented the teen idol, the album, the
concept album, the great American songbook, singers as actors, second acts, third acts, and he rivals
Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and Bing Crosby in his influence on how  singers sing. But I digress.
AARON KELLY  -- Sang "Fly Me To The Moon." Tony Bennett often does an acappella version in his act
but it's still Sinatra and Basie's swinging spin on this song that is definitive. Aaron stepped away from his
country comfort zone but wasn't able to locate any swing in his voice. He also seemed to do everything
BUT follow the melody when you need to let people know what it is you're singing before they can
appreciate any deviations. Plus, his voice never relaxed in the moment. The judges were overly polite,even the negative comments of Kara and Simon. On the plus side, Aaron has never looked cuter with his
swept back hair and vest and tie. Since he's the only contestant anyone under 20 can get really enthused
about (the rest are waaay too adult), that might just save him.
CASEY JAMES  -- Sang "Blue Skies," which of course Sinatra covered but still seems like Ella
Fitzgerald's song to me, especially the version where she starts off slow and wistful, then swings the hell
out of it. No one can do effervescence like Ella. Harry came over and joked "don't screw it up" with Caseyright before he performed, which was fun. But his bluesy spin was awkward. Casey looked like he was
afraid to move and had TONS of vibrato, which Kara also pointed out. Very stiff. Like Aaron, it was very
forgettable and that's almost worse than being bad.
CRYSTAL BOWERSOX  -- Sang "Summer Wind," a Sinatra tune I have never really enjoyed, though I
was amused by the duet he did with Julio Iglesias since it made them sound like they were singing this
love song to each other. She wore a big dress but the casual hair made it seem not too stuffy. I yearned to
love it but it was just pretty good. She had some interesting phrasing at the beginning, built to a big
climax and then had a nice quiet end. Not her sweet spot but far better than the first two.
MICHAEL LYNCHE  -- Sang "The Way You Look Tonight," while looking like he was in a costume for a
road show of Guys & Dolls.  Like the others, he sounded lost on the slow parts, which is where you can
really see how tricky it is to sing with an orchestra. He had a good finale with a big Idol -pleasing last
note, but it all felt a bit anonymous. The judges, perhaps looking to pretend the ultimate winner is not
inevitable, praised him.

<p>LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang "That's Life," a song that absolutely demands swagger. It seemed a disastrous
choice to me and not the right song for Lee at all. Why highlight your weakness? And I had to laugh when
he sang "riding high in April, shot down in May." As with everyone, Connick gave him good pointers, but
Lee's idea of swagger seemed to mainly include gesturing with his hands a lot. At the end, the songseemed to stop, and then start up again and crawl to the finale. Still, it wasn't bad and after the judgespraised him I listened again without the visuals and it seemed stronger to me. At this stage, he seems
likely to be joining Crystal in the finale.
So, in a week I found underwhelming, who will be the bottom three? I'd say Aaron, Casey and Michael
with Aaron and Casey in the bottom two and Casey going home. What did you think of the singers andtheir song choices? And I have a final question for Harry Connick Jr. My favorite albums of his are thepiano-based, casually wonderful collections of standards recorded when he was 20, 25 and 30,  all of
which were named after those ages. So where the heck is 35  and 40 ?

Mike, gonna have to disagree with you on the group sing-along s. I think they're great. 
Was last night sing-along recorded? I couldn't tell. 
I thought Casey would go home last night because I thought the Judges had more influence on the
voting. Obviously I was wrong. 
Right now I'll go out on a limb and predict that Lee and Casey will be the final 2. Now if Casey
gives at least one more great performanc e he will definitely be in the top 2 and with another great
performanc e after that he could go all the way. 
Still think Crystal is headed for a breakdown on national TV...... If Simon gives her a bad reviewshe's liable to snap.
Aaaaaaand. ... FINALLY they send Aaron packing. Finally. Thank the stars.
So. Big Mike goes next, followed by Casey and it's Lee and Crystal in the finale.
I liked Harry Connick's version of "And I Love Her". It had a Mel Torme-ish feel to it that was smooth
and appropriat ely understate d. To me it stood out on a show that requires several screaming/ belting
elements in each performanc e to get a '10 from the Russian judge'.
I'd love to see harry on Broadway (assuming he doesn't lean too heavy on the latest album)so glad to see his fans are sticking up for him. He's definitely a talent.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

52 FansHC jr made a very good case for replacing Simon!
The judges ALWAYS attack song selection. here is an idea. Each week the contestent s pick a song
and the judges pick a song for them. Stop wasting time with all the pre song interviews etc... That
way we can stop the lazy judges week after week saying "Bad song selection" rather than having togive actual critisicm.
I groaned when I heard it was going to be Sinatra night. Let the singers pick anything they want.
Don't make them sing oldies and try to make them relevant. I know it's sacrilegio us to say this (sorry,
Michael), but while Sinatra was good and had his definitive style, he’s overrated. Even within theRat Pack, I liked Dean Martin better. The best singer of all back then was Nat King Cole. Frankwas a great dramatic actor, however. 
But then I heard it would be Harry Connick and I was ready to watch again. He was the best mentor
yet. And it would have been more of a disaster if he hadn't arranged the songs and played with
them and his band. Lady Gaga was sensationa l, especially the staging and choreograp hy. 
Lee was by far the best. He's a great singer with a terrific voice, but he's been inconsiste nt. Now
he's hitting his stride while Crystal has slowed down. 
Michael was next best, Crystal third. Casey was probably the worst but Aaron was not much better.
I predicted it would be Aaron going home, but Michael is right that with more experience hedefinitely has a career ahead of him. 
I still doubt that Crystal will win, simply because of the teeny boppers and the Christian vote,
although I don’t know who they will vote for. Maybe Casey still has a chance if he’ll get back tosinging like he did with “Jealous Guy.”
Who is CHOOSING these evenings?? ? Seriously, "make it current, but here, do it with
these incredibly old, awkward freakin' songs."
Good god. Also, Crystal is screwing herself. Okay, we GET it, you have RANGE. Now, get back to
what it is you DO. There is no TIME for indulgence , lady.
Sigh. Did she not hear what Simon was saying to her? If there is anything that annoys me,it is a contestant arguing with Simon. Do they not know that he knows a hundredfol d what
they know about this business? Good god. And especially when it comes to thisCONTEST, for heaven's sake... he wants you to WIN, girl.
Next week the theme is Musicals from the 1890s. And hey, maybe Adam cancome back for a second time as mentor. It was the Gay Nineties, after all. 
And yes, whether they want to hear it or not, when Simon speaks they ought toNHBill    12:14 PM on 5/06/2010

23 Fanswrite it down and study their notes every day. No arguments or explanatio ns. Beg
him to tell you more. Glean everything you can from him. I feel like I've learned a
lot from him. I try to predict what he'll say about each performanc e, whether he
liked it or not, and what specifics he'll point to. An earlier commenter said theproducers tell the judges who to push and what to say. HA. I'd like to meet theperson on earth who could tell Simon what to say. 
The other judges have always been stage props. Kara knows the business, writes
some good songs, and sometimes says worthwhile things, but she's wrong or justout of touch most of the time .... Randy is essentiall y worthless. ...Yo.. listen up ...
dawg... pitchy pitchy...i n it to win it. He's a caricature of himself. I love Ellen, but we
all know she's no music critic. I loved it when Harry C. said there is no such thing
as pitchy.

I was embarrasse d for all but Crystal... I thought she did an okay job..it's a lovely song...but she
could have BELTED New York tho!...oh well... the rest....ev en connick's fav..the last guy..just
embarrassi ng..high point..was Ellen commenting on Harry's Organ...pe rfect timing..ta h dum!
Yep, Ellen and Harry were ready to go on the road together as a comedy duo.
I am trying to imagine what Siobhan would have sung last night. It would have been great to have
had an opportunit y to hear her with the big band sound. What do you think she would have chosen?
Knowing Siobhan, something out of leftfield or thoroughly unexpected because it would beso convention al. Maybe "My Way?" That captures her perfectly.
Siobhan actually said in a post-Idol interview that she would've sung "My Way"because it was her grandfathe r's favorite song.

59 FansWhen you hear the "lounge lizards" (that is my term of endearment for the old rat pack) doing the
"standards " the songs are enjoyable and seem easy! It's that "ease" of phrasing, attitude and vocals
that leads to a belief that the songs are simple. They are complex tunes and the lyrics are all aboutphrasing. I don't think these contestant s got that "standards " are very unforgivin g of errors, if you
don't know what you're doing just stay away!
True, but they had no choice. Standards night is always a toughie which is why I wish ithad come much earlier, when the stakes aren't as high.
The thing that surprised me was that Connick was by far the best mentor, in the way he actuallygot in there and schooled them rather than say Miley Cyrus going "uhhhh, you should smile more".But it just goes to show in many ways how raw these idols still are.
The one thing I didn't like, I thought they over praised Mike and Lee, and under priased Crystal. Not
that I loved Crystal, but their main critisism seemed to be that she didn't hit some big Siobanmoment at the end. I'm getting the idea that if Fantasia sang "Summertim e" this season they would
have blasted her for singing a slow song.
Ha! That's a reminder that Siobhan killed with a standard but none of these guys did.Perhaps one more example that most people are right for finding this season underwhelming, though I still think Crystal might be special.
I agree. Casey might be going home tonight... .. Casey and Mike will be in the bootom 2 with Crystal
joining them to make the bottom 3. 
The big story tonight wll be how does Crystal react to being in the bottom 3 if that happens. 
Let's be honest.... She's a meltdown ready to happen. 
I personally hope Mike goes home...... Somethng very annoying about a fat guy who doesn't seem
to know he's fat...... And he is fat...... That hat he had on made him look buffoonish .
I think Crystal would have loved to be in the bottom three in a way to humble her and getfans rallied and not taking it for granted.Permalink  | Share it

59 FansThose kids were probably saying "Frank who?" Anyway, I'm like Simon -- I'm outta here. The show
is boring (so is DWTS) and predictabl e. There is no Adam Lambert "glamor".
My wife and daughter are regular "Idol" watchers. I never watched it until last night, and onlybecause I am a huge Sinatra fan. Right off the bat, let me say I thought Crystal was far and awaythe best. "Summer Wind" is a beautiful song ~ a wistful story of a romance the singer yearns torelive ~ and she did the song justice. The rest of them, however, made some odd choices, notably,in the songs they decided to sing. I totally disagreed that Michael was good. It sounded like he wasswallowing the ends of words, and I didn't believe him once. Other than Crystal, they all looked likethey were in a bar singing karaoke.
Now, I thought it would have been very funny for Aaron to goof with the judges and audience with a
fake start. Stand center stage, a single spotlight on him, and sing:
"When I was seventeen,
it was a very good year."
Then bust into, "You Make Me Feel So Young".But, that's just me.
Funnily enough, he sang that very line in the results show and it still made me laugh. Good
call.
I think it's ironic that the judges are always telling the contestant s that they need to be relevant and
marketable , but then they have them sing Sinatra! Whoever made this decision for the show, it was
a huge mistake, especially this far into the competitio n.
True, though of course you can sing a classic and make it seem modern and relevant too.But in general I think it shows not that they shouldn't sing standards but that the only thingthe singers should strive for is not being "relevant" but good.
