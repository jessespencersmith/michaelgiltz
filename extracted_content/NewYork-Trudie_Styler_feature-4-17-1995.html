Inese Martyr Torture 
In Moving the Mountain, Michael Apted's documentary 
about the 1989 Taananmen Square massacre, news footage 
and amateur videos give us the ouUines of a clear and iden· 
tifiable oppressor-an aging, paranoid government. "This was 
the Peoples Anny, and the idea that it would tum on the people 
themselves was unthinkable," says Trudie StyIer, Moving the 
Mountain's producer. In The Day the Sun Tumed Cold, another 
new film-this one fictiona~bout 
China's troubles, director Vim Ho uses 
stark landscape photography and 
family nieIodrama to create a sense of 
oppression; the heaviness is more 
general and, in a way, more tragic. 
One bleak and snowy day, a son goes 
to a police station to accuse his motIt­
er of murdering his father. As his sto­
ry untolds, we begin to understand 
why this quiet, bitter, profoundly dis­
satisfied woman would secreUy de­
fy-then poison-a husband she 
hates and whom her peers won't let 
her leave. Uke the documentary, The Day the Sun Tumed Cold 
is based on actual events, but Ho has turned the story into a 
subUe depiction of all the ways in which a painfully conven· 
tional society can damage its members. The film stars the M0n­
golian actress Siqin Gowa and the Taiwanese actor Tuo 
Zhonghua. Moving the Mountain will be shown at a benefit for 
several human·rights organizations [including Amnesty Inter· 
national) on April 19 (call 629-6170, ext. 173) and opens April 
26 at Film Forum. The Day the Sun Tumed Cold opens April 21 
at Quad Cinema. PAT WECHSlER T
