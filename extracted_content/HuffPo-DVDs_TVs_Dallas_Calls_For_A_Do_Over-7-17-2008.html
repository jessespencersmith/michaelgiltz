"Jumping the shark" is pop culture slang forever
associated with Happy Days. But no showjumped that shark more shockingly and withmore unbridled disdain for its audience thanDallas , the primetime soap opera that revitalized
a genre and remains one of the most successfulTV shows of all time. Just out on DVD is Dallas:The Complete Ninth Season  ($39.98; Warner
Bros.). Forgive fans if they prefer to skip it, butthey'd be missing the most memorable scene in
the show's history. Not everyone remembers who shot JR but we ALL know what the presumablydead Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) was doing in Pam's shower at the very end of this season. Afterkilling off Bobby, the show spent the entire year in the doldrums creatively. JR (Larry Hagman)always had the fun, but apparently straight-laced, do-gooder Bobby was essential to the storylines.After years of being #1 or #2, Dallas  would end this dispiriting season at #6. But boy did they end
it -- Bobby was lathering up in the shower because Bobby wasn't actually dead. As they explainedin the first episode of season ten, Pam had dreamt the whole thing and fans had wasted the entireseason nine watching events that never really happened. The show rebooted with Bobby firmlyback in place and continued for five more years. But the bottom dropped out of the ratings: fanswere already annoyed at the weak ninth season. Being told they'd really  wasted their time and
none of what happened actually happened was just too much, even for the forgiving fans of soapswho happily accept evil twins and secret pregnancies and miraculous reversible comas withaplomb. The show immediately fell from #6 to #11 and then #22, #29 and then out of the Top 30.Some might argue the show would never have lasted that long if they hadn't realized their mistakein killing Bobby and started all over again. But it poisoned the memory of the show for fans. Afeature film version starring John Travolta as JR makes perfect sense. But maybe it's taking so longto get off the ground because of the lingering ill-will from one episode some 20 years ago thatturned the show into a joke. And you can be darn certain if the movie's made that they won't show

Bobby Ewing in the shower: people would never stop laughing.
Also out this week: Jason Statham's The Bank Job  ($29.95; LionsGate), an enjoyable,
unpretentious B movie; Holly Hunter's Emmy nominated turn as the exceptionally flawed hero of
Saving Grace Season One  ($49.98; Fox); a Blu-Ray edition of the Keanu Reeves/Patrick Swayze
cult favorite Point Break  ($39.98; Fox); the well-reviewed story of a boy caught up in Pele fever
while his folks have disappeared in The Year My Parents Went On Vacation ($26.98; City Lights);the cat-like Burt Reynolds (how many lives does he have, actually?) and his sitcom fluff EveningShade Season One  ($39.99; Paramount); Jacques Tati's minor but still amusing Trafic  ($39.95;
Criterion); Swamp Thing: The Series Volume Two  ($34.99; Shout), which has its fans though I
can't help missing Adrienne Barbeau; Martin Lawrence and Raven-Symone's mild, self-explanatoryCollege Road Trip ($29.99; Disney) whose only pleasure is the possibility that parents will belooking for this and rent the raunchy, hilarious Road Trip  instead; an ok biopic of the nattily
dressed Beau Brummell: This Charming Man  ($24.99; Acorn); A Throw Of Dice  ($29.95; Kino), a
1929 silent film spectacle set in India that is great fun; Stargate Atlantis Season Four  ($49.98;
MGM), in which -- unthinkably -- our heros team up with the Wraiths to fend off the even more
evil Replicators; the bare-bones but eye-opening documentary Our Spirits Don't Speak English:
Indian Boarding School ($29.95; Rich-Heape); Tony N' Tina's Wedding  ($24.95; Emerging
Pictures), which fails to capitalize on the name value of the long-running Off Broadway hit it's
based on; Reno 911 Fifth Season  ($39.98; Paramount), but this series long ago went from
dumb/funny to just plain dumb; the Wong Kar Wai blessed 1993 martial arts spoof Eagle ShootingHeroes  ($24.95; Kino) and finally I'm waiting anxiously for new seasons of classic shows like Hill
Street Blues, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, St. Elsewhere and I'll Fly Away  (to name a few) but an
insta-flop like Birds of Prey: The Complete Series  ($39.98; Warner Bros.) is out in a well-packaged
set? Oh the power of fan boys and a cast of hot women that know something about a well-
packaged set.
So tell me, what's your most memorable TV jump-the-shark moment? I've been pretty distressed
by the Friday Night Lights murder subplot and the revival (literally) of Buffy for two more seasonof Buffy The Vampire Slayer when the show was clearly over. What about you?

Anyone remember this chestnut? 
The already grating Mork and Mindy adding Jonathan Winters to the cast ,as the happy couple's infant
son!(?)

Love the idea of a "Dallas" feature film, but please, enough John Travolta already. Cast Daniel Day-
Lewis as J.R., tell him to pull out all the stops, and then get out of the way.

"charmed" will repackage this fall with interactive premium edition content and theme packaging as amagical tome. october release. this will set the mark perhaps until the complete "smallville" around ayear from now. interactive chat and board software will define premium editions if "charmed" does wellfor the holidays.

Yep, some shows already out on DVD -- liked Charmed and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. -- geta deluxe re-packaging while some of my favorites still molder in studio vaults. But glad to
hear it for fans of the show. Personally, I always preferred Buffy and really checked out when
Shannen Doherty did.

they're not holding out on much that's at all familiar any more- except some nominal
failures that developed followings for their few episodes. "lookwell"[1] and "sledgehammer" are in that group. have you run across "titans", the rare spelling flop? orperhaps "fresno", the barry kemp[2] spoof of "dynasty" wherein the wonderful- andnow gravely ill- terri garr burned down the set as spoiled daughter "talon"?[1] "lookwell", trying to come out of crime-fighting retirement,
to desk officer at station: "of course you've
never heard of me! my records were erased! i was given a new identity! like bat
masterson!"
desk officer: "who's batmasterson?"lookwell: "exactly!"[2] after the reagan landslide in 1980, people were straggling out of the hills in bell-bottoms and sideburns to surrender like bypassed japanese soldiers from ww ii. no one knew anybody who voted for the guyand he took about 49 states!?!thriftstore racks were full of designer bellbottoms:normandy rose, jordache, gloria vanderbilt... barry kemp struck back with "newhart","taxi", and a remake of the visionary proto-reality sixties lighteningbolt "loveamerican style". he became our spiritual leader.
