            <p>M O N D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6Bond Is Going To Set New RecordsI was wrong about the new Bond. I thought it was definitely a step inthe right direction, but assumed that the low-key action and a draggysecond half would keep it from being a world-beater. Instead, the greatreviews and apparent audience satisfaction are pushing "CasinoRoyale" to record highs. It's already at $94 mil in the US and is almostcertain to beat the $160 million US record of "Die Another Day." In theUK, it's at $53 million and will blast past the $57 million record of"DAD." Worldwide, it's already at $222 million, with the $431 millionworldwide take of "DAD" also well within reach. Heck, it might eventurn Japan into a nation of Bond lovers. (That country has always beenblase about Bond.) Daniel Craig should be showered in champagne bythe producers.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

2  C O M M E N T S :joe said...Saw it on Friday and LOVED it. Really excited with the directionthey're taking the franchise. In my mind there are three tiers of Bondfilms...1. The first four (my fav Connery versions)2. The last four (with Brosnan)3. Everything in betweenI place Casino Royale firmly in the top tier, and Daniel Craig is the bestBond since Connery (who will never be topped) in my opinion.I think part of the reason for the success is that this is the first trulymodern take on one of the original Fleming novels thanks to theproblems with the Broccoli clan getting the rights. Hopefully whoeverwrites the next screenplay stays more true to the spirit of Casino Royalethan churning out another version of Die Another Day.2:08 PM
