Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayIn this paperback original, behavioral economist Dan Ariely compiles some of the most popular entries in his"Ask Ariely" column for the Wall Street Journal, along with some expanded answers and brand newconundrums. Part Dear Abby, part Freakonomics for behavior, Ariely typically uses silly and serious questions(why do I cheat on my diet late at night? what's the best way for a group of friends to split a dinner bill? where dothose missing socks go?) to illuminate psychological ideas or reframe the question in a way that helps youunderstand what's really at stake. He even offers practical solutions. (Can't decide which of two cars to buy? Flipa coin! Then he explains why.) If you've got a pulse, you'll surely disagree with some of the advice Arielyoffers...and I'm sure there's a psychological term for this that Ariely will illuminate the next time around. Theamusing cartoons by New Yorker regular William Haefeli aren't just a welcome added bonus; they wittily add tothe conversation with their own wry perspective. -- Michael GiltzWhat Others Say“The human brain is one of the largest mysteries in the world. Trying to understand its complexities and improve ourbehavior is one of the main challenges society deals with. In Irrationally Yours, Dan shares with us some of thesemysteries and the tools for accomplishing this task.” - Anthony “Tony” Robbins, #1 New York Times bestsellingauthor of Unlimited Power, Unleash the Power Within and Awaken the Giant Within“With 70% of his body burned, 3 years in hospital, and decades of experiments in social science, Dan views life froma unique perspective. In this thoroughly entertaining book Dan provides insightful advice to a vast range of humanproblems. I loved it.” - Terry Jones, Monty Python member, director, actor and writer“Ariely is a master observer of human foibles. His advice is funny, thoughtful, and well-founded. Sometimes all threetogether. My advice: read it, enjoy it, think about it.” - Al Roth, Nobel Laureate in Economics and Craig andSusan McCaw Professor of Economics at Stanford University“Dan is the most provocative, interesting, and to-the-point advice columnist you…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
