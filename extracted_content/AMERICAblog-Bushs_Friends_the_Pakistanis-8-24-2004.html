8/24/2004 10:15:00 PMBush's cynical idea of a good ally is Pakistan (not mention the corruptmonarchy of Saudi Arabia that has lined the pockets of companies heand his daddy worked for and with).Pakistan has always harbored terrorists and supported themworldwide, it sold nuclear material and know-how to the highestbidders and now it's shielding the Taliban.If you want to know about someone's character, look to their friends.
