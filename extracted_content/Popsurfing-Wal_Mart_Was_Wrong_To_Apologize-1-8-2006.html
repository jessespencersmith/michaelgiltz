            <p>S U N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 8 ,  2 0 0 6Wal-Mart Was Wrong...To ApologizeWal-Mart had another hit to its pr image thanks to its website, whichwas selling "Planet of the Apes -- The Complete TV Series." Under"similar items" included DVDs on African American figures like Dr.Martin Luther King, Jr.Wal-Mart was wrong, of course. (It usually is.) But this time it waswrong for apologizing, at least for pretending the link was racist. Ofcourse, Wal-Mart was running in the other direction from a seeminglyracist slur and none of its top executives have probably even seen thedarn movies.But not only are the "Planet of the Apes" movies not racist, they areexplicitly anti-racist. That is, indeed, the entire point of them,especially the first one, "Planet of the Apes." Entire books have beenwritten on this topic. This isn't just one way of considering the movies,and it's not subtext either. It's text. It is entirely what the movies areabout: the fact that you shouldn't treat people like animals just becausethey seem different from you.It was written by Rod Serling, a very liberal guy, who often usedallegories in The Twilight Zone and elsewhere, commenting on socialand racial issues via fantasy and sci-fi.Those links are always silly -- Do you like Citizen Kane? You'll likeAmerican Pie too! -- so it could have just been "accidental." More likely,people who looked at POTA also looked at films on civil rights, becausethat is exactly what POTA is about.Wal-Mart panicked when they should have just said, 'This movie iswidely seen by critics and fans as an allegory about the civil rightsmovement. It was written by Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone, whooften used fantasy and sci-fi to tackle the social issues of the time. Indeference to anyone who may be offended because they're unfamiliarwith the film, we'll unlink the recommendations to other dvds thattackle civil rights issues. But we encourage everyone to explore this filmas much more than merely an entertaining tale. It comments wiselyand revealingly on racial issues and the folly of treating people cruellyNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
