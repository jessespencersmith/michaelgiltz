9/18/2005 12:40:00 AMNewly unclassified info about the Army's systematic use oftorture and abuse (and even killing) of prisoners -- some ofwhom the Army itself acknowledges were completely innocentand should never have been held in the first place -- has cometo light, says LA Times. No surprises, but it's still a shock toread that:Army officers in Iraq told their superiors last year thatsoldiers often lacked the training to handle detainees, didnot always understand what constituted abuse andsometimes used techniques against prisoners thatthey "remembered from movies," according to militaryrecords made public Thursday.In two incidents described in the reports, bound detaineeswere shot and killed by soldiers. Although thecircumstances were unclear, officers or Army lawyerssaid afterward that the killings could have beenprevented with better training, facilities andunderstanding by soldiers of the rules ofengagement.The Army defends itself by pointing out they've conducted some 400investigations, some resulting in court martials, non-judicialpunishment and other penalties. But 400 invesitations is no reason toassume a pattern.Paul Boyce, an Army spokesman, said the documentsrepresented "Army reports and Army information, wherethe Army was looking into allegations and sorting out thesituation about detainee mistreatment."But he said they did not show widespread abuse.So if 400 investigations doesn't constitute widespread -- that's about1 new investigation every day and a half for the past 21 months --what would? 4000?
