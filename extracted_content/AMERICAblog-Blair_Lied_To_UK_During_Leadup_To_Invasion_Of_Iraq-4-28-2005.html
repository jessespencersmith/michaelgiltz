4/28/2005 10:51:00 AMHey, here's one more thing Bush and Blair have in common:it's become increasingly clear to the British people that TonyBlair lied about the legal advice he was given before theinvasion of Iraq. Per UK's The Independent:The publication of Lord Goldsmith's report last nightcould prove to be the "smoking gun" that shows TonyBlair misled Parliament and the country over the war.Last night, Mr Blair - unaware that the report wasabout to be leaked - was caught out still claiming onSky News that the advice from the Attorney General"didn't change".Professor Peter Hennessy, an expert on constitutionalaffairs, said: "The whole thing reeks." Dominic Grieve,the Tory legal affairs spokesman said: "There hasbeen a gross deception."Families of some of the British soldiers killed in Iraqsaid they were preparing a legal case against thePrime Minister, based on the leaked document.No wonder those two get along so well.
