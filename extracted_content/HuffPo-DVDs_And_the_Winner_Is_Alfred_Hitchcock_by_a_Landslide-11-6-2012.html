            <p>DVDs:  And  the  Winner  Is...  Alfred
Hitchcock  by  a  Landslide!
Here's one poll you can trust: whenever film buffs vote on the best directors of all time,
Alfred Hitchcock will score highly. If you're looking for a distraction on Election Day untilthe results are in, check out my reviews of a new boxed set of Hitch and other releases.
ALFRED  HITCHCOCK:  THEMASTERPIECE  COLLECTION($299.98 BluRay; Universal) -- As youknow, Alfred Hitchcock is one of thegreatest directors of all time and surelyone of the most purely cinematic. Hisstories were conceived entirely as movies,whatever their source, and have his
particular stamp. Even the most casual of
movie fans can understand what an
auteur is if they think of Hitch. Any boxed
set of his work is cause for celebration
and this 15 film set from Universal is noexception. It's not definitive -- hugechunks of his career are not covered here-- but as with any era of his work, it
contains a strong number of genuine classics: Rear  Window,  Psycho,  Vertigo,  North  ByNorthwest  and Shadow  Of  A  Doubt  to be specific. I could name five other movies of his
just as great but even these would be enough to enshrine his name forever. All thesemovies look terrific in this new BluRay boxed set, by and large. And the packaging iselegant and ideal. The set is compact, taking up the space of just two regular DVD boxeson your shelf. But it contains those five movies and ten more for a total of 15 in all,including other strong films like Saboteur,  The  Man  Who  Knew  Too  Much  remake and
The  Birds.  I couldn't find a credit but whomever designed the graphic look of this box
deserves a raise. The artwork on the front is subtle and smart, the stills montage on thebook is sensational and that same montage forms the profile of Hitch on the inside coverof the booklet/album that slides out nicely.Each thick page incorporates one of the great

<p>posters created for each film and while I generally dislike sleeves to contain discs, these
are so glossy and smooth inside and out that potential damage to the discs is minimal. The
booklet is also well designed. In short, this set has been beautifully produced from top tobottom...except for one tiny detail. Unfortunately, it's the most important detail of all: theremastering of the movies presented on BluRay. The most popular and acclaimed titleshave usually been taken care of, hence the ease with which North  By  Northwest  and Rear
Window  are seen here. It's the later, lesser films that get the short end of the stick. This
isn't just a case of poor source material but unnecessary indifference on the part of thepeople involved: how else to explain the shabby treatment of Frenzy  and Family  Plot  and
Marnie  in particular. I'm no techie obsessed with subtle details and sound mix issues, so
believe me when it's apparent that the utmost care was not taken with a significantminority of the films here. The most egregious errors meant the set had to be delayed inorder to correct errors in a newly designed title sequence on one film, but no effort wasmade to change the sloppy job done on a number of films here. Let me be clear: this setcontains strong editions of some of the best titles here and they look smashing on BluRay.The lesser films are mildly acceptable in a boxed set where the movies you will enjoy mostlook good and the movies you will watch least are indifferent or poor. They're not terriblyworse than the DVD versions in earlier sets or individual releases. But it's a crying shameany caveats have to be offered on a set for one of Hollywood's greatest and most populardirectors. If all his films (even the minor ones) can't be treated with care, whose will be?I'd take the ill with the good if you don't own any of these films or just want them onBluRay, so this isn't a dismissal of the set. The movies are too good for that and the besthere do look very good. But this is not up to the standard of Universal's recent excellentMonster  boxed set or the individual releases like Jaws  that they've put out this
anniversary year. P.S. What are his greatest hits, the best of the best? The  39  Steps,  TheLady  Vanishes,  Rebecca,  Shadow  Of  A  Doubt,  Notorious,  Rear  Window,  Vertigo,  NorthBy  Northwest  and Psycho .
LOVE  COMES  SOFTLY  10THANNIVERSARY  COLLECTION
($69.98 DVD; Fox)
THE  KATHY  GRIFFIN
COLLECTION:  RED  WHITE  +  RAW
($24.97 DVD; Shout)COPPER  SEASON  ONE  ($59.98
BluRay; BBC)
THE  STREETS  OF  SAN  FRANCISCO
SEASON  FIVE  ($89.98 DVD;
Paramount) COLUMBO:  THE  COMPLETESERIES  ($149.98 DVD; Universal) --
The novels by Janette Oke launched thefamily drama TV movie franchise LoveComes  Softly  ten years ago. Few entries
in the annual TV movies have matchedthe quality of the original starringKatherine Heigl but they're alldependable, wholesome fare for thoselooking for a slightly  more adult,
romantic spin on frontier dramas a laLittle  House  and Dr.  Quinn . This nicely
compact set contains ten movies in thefranchise, though for some inexplicablereason I don't fathom not the eleventhone (a Christmas special) that is availableseparately. If you find a person who ispassionate about Love Comes Softly andKathy Griffin, I'd marry her. You can't puta price on never knowing what to expect</p>
<p>from a partner. It's more likely the cross-
over in these two titles will be modest,thanks to Griffin's naughty Bravo specialspoking fun at everyone and everything inscandalous, secular style. For thoselooking for TV sets with mystery, the firstseason of Copper  holds promise. The first
original drama for BBC America
somehow makes sense in that
environment, even though the only thing"BBC" about it is the aim for quality inthis relatively violent and gritty look at
police work in New York City in 1864.
Things were politer but no less easier on
the West Coast in the 1970s. The final
season of The  Streets  Of  San  Francisco
prove that. It doesn't help that Michael
Douglas took off for Hollywood after two
episodes and handed the baton to
Richard Hatch, but Karl Malden remains
a no-nonsense anchor. Just one more
thing...the best TV set of all this week is acomplete collection of Columbo  that
contains both the entire series and theTV movies in a nice compact set. PeterFalk's shambling, curious, slyly intelligentdetective remains a sheer delight, even ifthe mysteries and guest stars date theshow a bit.
THE  INVISIBLE  WAR  ($29.95 DVD;
Docurama) -- Surely the most enraging
film of the year is this documentary aboutthe epidemic of rape in the military. TheInvisible  War  convincingly asserts that
twenty percent of all active duty femaleservicemembers are sexually assaulted. Itfollows the story of soldiers who selflesslyoffer to serve their country and then areraped and abandoned by the institutionthey sacrificed so much to join. This isnot a problem because women are part ofthe military. It's a problem reflective ofsociety where rape is treated toocavalierly and public image is placedabove justice and honor. Anyone puzzledby how a football program or a religiousinstitution or a national broadcastingnetwork can look the other way at childmolestation should watch this film.They'll see another example of how faraway we are from actively and regularlyconfronting acts of sexual violence against
women, men and children.
THE  FORGIVENESS  OF  BLOOD
($39.95 BluRay; Criterion)SUNDAY  BLOODY  SUNDAY  ($29.95
DVD; Criterion)</p>
<p>ELENA  ($29.99 DVD; Zeitgeist) -- It's
always exciting when Criterion throws its
support behind a new director. I think I'dbe more excited by that stamp of approvalthan almost any award short of an Oscar.So I'm sure director Joshua Marston wasthrilled by the reception to his strong firstfeature Maria  Full  Of  Grace.  His
somehow unexpected followup is just asadventurous: a tale of a blood feud incontemporary Albania centering around ateen who is literally trapped in his home.If he leaves, enemies will kill him inrevenge. Nothing personal; it's just theway things are. It didn't get quite thetraction that Maria  enjoyed, but not to
worry Marston: Criterion has spottedyour career potential and thrown its lotin with you thanks to this typically finerelease with strong extras. I may beespecially attuned to this film since afriend of mine is in Albania even as wespeak shooting a documentary about thatcountry's 100th anniversary. But any filmlover will spot the intelligence at work inthis solid second film. I'm not a big fan ofJohn Schlesinger so that probably
explains why it took me so long to see his
love triangle Sunday  Bloody  Sunday.  It
was obviously bold for its day with the
matter-of-fact depiction of a gay manplayed by Peter Finch (albeit withclassical music in the background and soon). But the strong performances slowlywon me over until the theatrical flourishat the end quite blindsided me. The pity isthat I can't find Murray Head a worthyobject of affection for Finch or themarvelous Glenda Jackson. Still, it holdsup better than most "controversial"movies of the early 1970s, thankgoodness. I bet someday Criterion puts afilm by director Andrey Zvyagintsev intheir hall of fame. His movie The Returnwas masterful. This follow-up is alsocontrolled and intriguing if not quite as</p>
<p>emotionally gripping. It shows a husband
and wife living in tense domesticity. He'sdying and she's the blue collar nurse who
was once his care taker but graduated to his wife. They live in luxury though her lazy,needy family is always nearby seemingly with a hand out for a hand-out, which brings outhis disdain. Elena is always there quietly, observantly; tending to his needs, mediatingbetween him and her family, spending time with her children and their families when shecan. When Elena brings about a truce between her husband and his daughter from anearlier marriage, it works out a little too well and he makes clear her kids will never see apenny now that his child has reunited with him. What to do? Elena apparently will find ananswer. A marvelous score by Philip Glass proves the composer knows talent when he seesit too.
ABRAHAM  LINCOLN,  VAMPIREHUNTER  ($39.99 BluRay; Fox)
TYLER  PERRY'S  MADEA'SWITNESS  PROTECTION  ($39.98
BluRay; Lionsgate)THE  CAMPAIGN  ($29.98 BluRay;
Warner Bros.)RUBY  SPARKS  ($29.98 BluRay; Fox) --
Mostly, these are the sort of moviespeople rent and stream because they'relooking for something to watch and, hey,these were advertised and they rememberthe ads. So instead of watching a classicthey're a lot more likely to love, peoplejust watch whatever came out in theatersfour or five months ago. Ah well. Don'tsay I didn't warn you: the best thingabout Abraham  Lincoln,  Vampire  Hunter
is in fact it's title. The  Campaign  isn't
nearly as funny as the trailer might leadyou to believe and after the Presidentialelection is over, it may well be the lastthing in the world you'd want to watchright now. Tyler Perry continues toimprove as a director and with a strongsupporting cast -- Marla Gibbs, EugeneLevy, John Amos and Doris Roberts --this is one of the stronger Madea  films.
Still you know what you're getting. Youdon't know what you're getting with RubySparks , an offbeat romantic comedy
about a struggling writer (Paul Dano) whoimagines a dream girl only to see her</p>
<p>come to life. It doesn't fulfill the premise
of this quirky idea but at least it's trying.
LONG  DAY'S  JOURNEY  INTO
NIGHT  ($24.95 BluRay;
Olive/Paramount)THE  BRAIN  ($24.95 BluRay;
Olive/Paramount) -- Two films withabsolutely nothing in common exceptboth are out on Bluray thanks to Olive.Long  Day's  Journey  is one of Sidney
Lumet's peak works, featuring KatharineHepburn, Ralph Richardson, Jason
Robards Jr. and Dean Stockwell in
Eugene O'Neill's lengthy tragedy. It's
quietly hellish. The  Brain  is a polar
opposite, a feature film frothy bit ofnonsense starring David Niven, as thecriminal mastermind of the title. I vividlyremember this crime caper's finale, anearly lesson in the fact that stories don'thave to be tied up neatly (or even
"ended") in order to be satisfying. But my
pleasure over rediscovering a childhood
flick I enjoyed on TV late at night was
trumped by my astonishment that the
film is in French. This international co-
production was filmed in both Englishand French and naturally I only saw themuch shorter English version onAmerican TV. But here is Niven rattlingaway in French (he doesn't even seem tobe dubbed!) and an extra 15 minutes inthe twists and turns for me to puzzleover. Really, you could knock me overwith a feather.
