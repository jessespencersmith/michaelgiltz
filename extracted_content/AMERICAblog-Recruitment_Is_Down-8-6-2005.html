8/06/2005 11:39:00 AMEveryone knows recruitment is down dramatically despitelowered standards. High school dropout? No problem. Got arecord? We'll deal with it. And it doesn't take a rocket scientistto figure out why. But reenlistment is holding steady and evenexceeding expectations. That's a dramatic switch from Vietnamwhen reenlistment followed recruitment in a race to thebottom. Some on the far right argue that since reenlistment isup that the soldiers must know something we don't and thatthings are actually going much better than it appears in Iraq.See, Iraq isn't Vietnam.Well, I didn't buy that but I have been puzzling over thereasons why reenlistment remains relatively strong. Then therather obvious answer struck me: this is their job. Thesesoldiers are lifers, devoted to a career in the military. Walkingaway from it is a dramatic and scary switch from a track in lifethat is laid out and clear -- the very thing that appeals to manyof them about the military.David M. Kennedy wrote an op-ed in the NYT on July 25pointing out that for all intents and purposes, our military isnow composed of paid mercenaries. He went to great pains tomake clear this was not pejorative -- anymore than people whotake on the dangerous and important tasks of policeman orfireman are somehow diminished by acknowledging that it'stheir job as well as a calling. (And everyone recognizes it's acalling other people don't hear because it is dangerous anddemanding. That's why we respect them.) Kennedy waswarning about the dangers of letting a very small group ofpeople take most of the burden of war upon them. If we're atwar, all our lives should be impacted. That's clearly not thecase now and that makes war all the more tempting for ourleaders and too easy for the rest of us to let the fighting recedeinto the background.But back to reenlistment. In Vietnam and Korea and World WarII, most of the people who were drafted did their stint and thenwent home. (In WW II, that was after victory, of course; Iraq's"victory" per Bush came ages ago.) They were schoolteachersand mechanics and lawyers and businessmen. Some of thempresumably felt drawn to a life in the military they hadn'tconsidered before, but most went back home and got on withtheir lives.Iraq is the first drawn-out conflict in modern times for which noone has been officially drafted. The soldiers bravely fightingoverseas are lifers devoted to this career. It is their job. It istheir world. Not reenlisting would mean abandoning this andstarting something new they may be ill-prepared to face. Is itany surprise they're reluctant to do so? Back in Vietnam andKorea, not reenlisting meant getting on with your life, notabandoning it.So it's no surprise soldiers are reenlisting -- they are devotedto a career in the military and devoted to protecting anddefending this country. They don't get to choose where they'resent or why -- all they can do is follow orders and behavehonorably. The fact that they haven't abandoned their career is
