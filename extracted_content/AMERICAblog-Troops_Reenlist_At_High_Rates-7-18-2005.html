7/18/2005 10:21:00 AMUSA Today reports that -- unlike Vietnam -- our brave soldierscontinue to reenlist at high rates, partially making up for theshortfall in new recruits. Why? In part, money.Re-enlistment bonuses range from as little as $1,000 to asmuch as $150,000, depending on the type of job and lengthof re-enlistment. The $150,000 bonuses are offered only tosenior special operations commandos who agree to stay inthe military for up to six more years. The average bonus is$10,000, said Col. Debbra Head, who monitors Armyretention at the Pentagon.But however much money is dangled in front of them, it isremarkable and brave that they would choose to reenlist in a war thatevery grunt knows has been mismanged since the day Baghdad felland which the American people believe Bush lied about to beef upsupport for invasion. Thanks to murderous ethnic rivalries, the peopleof Iraq who suffered under Hussein continue to suffer under dailysuicide bombings -- the attack that astonished London is Iraq's dailybread. Our soldiers can't change how the war is executed, but to theircredit they must feel a bond with their fellow soldiers and the peopleof that country.Imagine what our troops could do if they were properly armed andequipped, with enough boots on the ground to secure the peace anda commander in chief who faced up to tough problems instead ofignoring them. Maybe in three and a half years....
