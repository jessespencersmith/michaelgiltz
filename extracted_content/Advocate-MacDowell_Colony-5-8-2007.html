Acabin of
OneSown
New Englands MacDowell Colony celebrates .l00 years of
artistic utopia. And the gay and lesbian artists who prospered
there celebrate its role in their careers
hough not founded or
necessarily intended to
cater to LGBT artists,
the MacDowell Colony
has a rich history of doing just
that. The Peterborough, N.H.,
retreat center for creative
types-along with New York's
Yaddo, the most famous of its
kind-celebrates 100 years of
existence 1n 2007, and scores of
queer residents, both past and
present, are among those pay-
ing homage. (A documentaty on
the colony premieres at the Mu-
seum of Modern Art in New
York City on May 2.)
"I can't overpraise them,"
says writer Sarah Schulman,
who's now at MacDowell for the
sixl"h time, working on the musi-
cal adaptation of her novel
Shimmer. "In 1984, I published
my frrst novel, and it was at a
time when modern lesbian frc-
tion was not published by anymainstream publisher in this
country, was not carried in
mainstream bookstores, was not
reviewed il mainstream maga-
zines," she says. "I wouldn't
have had a career if I hadn't
gone there. They were able to
see the quality of writing with-
out being swayed in aly way by
the lesbian content.
"And as far as I know," she
adds, "they were the only insti
tution where that was true at
the time."
Artist Doug Wright worked
on both his Pulitzer Prize-wrn-
ning play I Am My Own Wife
and the current Broadway hit
musical Grey Gardens at Mac-
Dowell. "Ttrey have all these lit-
tle studios spread out across
the beautiful New Hampshire
woods," he recalls. "I was rn a
gorgeous little cabin, and every
day they delivered my lunch
and they delivered some fire-wood. I'd make a little fire in my
fireplace and I'd go to work.
'"There was this quiet aura of
industry about the place."
Wright continues. 'You never
felt obligated to work, and yet
you knew the time was so rare
and the surroundings were so
lush that you had betler seize
the moment and produce some-
thing. I found it an extraordi-
narily muse-friendly spot "
Filmmaker Ira Sachs, who
worked on the screenplay for
his new movie. Married Life,
while at MacDowell, notes the
influential ghosts of residents
past. 'You can't help thinking
about it when you're in one of
those studios," he remembers.
"Thornton Wilder was Lhere,
Leonard Bernstein was there,
and you're there You're part of
a great tradition."
The studios have a perma-
nent record: "They have theseClockwise from

Dowell resident

Omicron studio;
past resident
Leonard Bern-
stein; the
Watson studio
wonderful 'tombstones' on the
wall, and everyone who has
been irr your studio or cabin pre-
viously inscribes them before
leaving," says Wright, who owes
"a real debt" to MacDowell
"You find [names] like Aaron
Copland, these titanic frgures
from the history of American
arts and letters. So if you're
lacking inspiration, you just
have to pemse the walls."
Or a pornographic DVD: "I
think you should get everyone
to describe how they masturbat-
ed while at MacDowell," says
Sachs with a laugh, remember-
ing that a steamy flick was once
passed around. "I can promise
you its a primary part of the ex-
peience." -Michoel Giltz
