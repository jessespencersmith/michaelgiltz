            <p>Next wave: bad kids, brave wives 
"Brat Camp" heads to U.S. By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
THlNK reality shows 
have gone as far as 
they can? Think again. 
Wife swapping and boot 
camp for back-talking 
teens are just lhe latest 
outrageous reality shows 
from overseas that are 
coming soon to America. 
Because Britain is the 
home of smashes like 
"American Idol" and 
"Who Wants To Be A 
Millionaire," most British 
hits are instantly snapped 
up by the major networks 
looking for a new reality 
genre. Up first? "Wife Swap." 
In this hit show -re­
named simply "The 
Swap" by a prudish ABC 
for its a seven-part series 
in spring or summer -
two women exchange fam­
ilies (but not bedrooms) 
for 10 days. 
The debut episode in 
England caused a stir by 
pairing a white woman 
who is opposed to interra-. 
cial marriages with a sexist 
black man and his family. 
The less incendiary US 
version has a California 
New Age-y vegetarian 
swapping lives with a sub-urban Italian family from 
the Northeast. ABC's real­
ity guru Andrea Wong told 
Variety: "We made the 
pilot and just loved it. It's 
funny; it's dramatic." 
And back in the UK, 
they've come up with a 
spin-off: "Celebrity Wife 
Swap" is the No.1 show on 
Britain's top commercial 
channel right now. 
Another big UK hit? The 
deliciously titled .. Brat 
Camp," which takes six 
misbehaving teenagers and 
sends them on an Outward 
Bound-type journey for 50 
days in Utah where they 
face subzero temperatures and no-nonsense instruc­
tors. 
The kids are genuinely 
troubled: Dan, Tom and 
James are all drug addicts, 
Charlie and Fran (the 
show's breakout brat) have 
destructive rages and Ra­
chaeI is a binge drinker., 
Watching these kids who 
used to get away with mur­
der paying their dues is 
terrific fun -with counse­
lors devising punishments 
like making every kid who 
swears pick up a stone and 
put it'in their backpack. 
The finale airs tomorrow 
night in Britain, with view­
ers tuning in to see which kids "graduate" and which 
have more growing up to 
do. 
According to the show's 
producers, they've held off 
until the final ratings are in 
before deciding which 
overseas offer they'll take. 
Another batch of epi­
sodes is already in the 
works and Jameli :-:;-, the 
16-year-old drug ~ser -
says the show has ,helped 
him. and even his friends. 
Sort of. 
"One of my mates isiike, 
'You're my idol; I'm pnly 
smoking [pot] once a week 
now;" James told a British 
magazine. I
