 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Rupert Everett Growls His
Way Through Pygmalion
PYGMALION  ** out of ****
LORD OF THE FLIES  * 1/2 out of ****
OPERATION GREENFIELD  ** 1/2 out of ****
PYGMALION  ** out of ****
Has another great play ever been so strongly eclipsed by
a musical version? Pygmalion  is one of Bernard Shaw's
best works, but it is clearly in the shadow of My FairLady , one of the greatest musicals of all time. It's lovely
to revisit this comic romance sans music; but it's ashame they didn't come up with any particular reasonfor doing so.
Rupert Everett is certainly spot-on casting as the world's
most famous confirmed bachelor, that woman-hating linguist Professor Henry Higgins. He and new
friend Pickering spot a ragged flower girl with atrocious grammar one evening. Higgins vows to improveher speech and manners so much that in six months time she could pass for a duchess at anambassador's ball. By George, I think he'll do it.
The set design is particularly unattractive and the direction quite dull. (Often, actors merely stand or sit
at opposite ends of the stage and talk to each other.) Both are unfortunately credited to Philip Prowsewho has worked in Glasgow theater for decades.

<p>This production opened on the road and then recast its Eliza Doolittle with one-time Eastenders  star
Kara Tointon. She is too broad as the guttersnipe and not refined enough as the reborn swan, though
Tointon certainly has the loveliness down pat. The one scene in which she shines is the show's bestmoment: her first outing as a lady where Eliza keeps saying "How do you do?" with exaggerated elan.
Without a proper foil, the dependable Everett is a bit adrift, barking and sniping in a show far more
serious and dark than the one at hand. Even the great Diana Rigg can do little here, though she does it
with charm. Only Peter Eyre puts a stamp on Pickering, playing the role with subdued dignity and a voice
so sonorous and lovely it makes the rest of us sound like Cockney layabouts.
LORD OF THE FLIES  * 1/2 out of ****
The Regents Park Open Air Theatre  is akin to New York's Shakespeare in the Park, a novel way to
experience theater. New artistic director Timothy Sheader has smartly expanded the reach of the theater
by programming more adventurous fare. It doesn't always work, but the gambit will make this venue
healthier in the long run.
I'm simply not a fan of Lord Of The Flies  in any of its forms. The story is so blunt and obvious as parable
that the fun is taken out, though it does make it catnip for teachers who want a short book their students
might actually read. The tale depicts British schoolboys crash-landed on an island. Decent folk wouldexpect these lads to pull together and be sensible. Surely they'll care for the little ones and stay safe whilewaiting for rescue? Instead, the little beasties soon degenerate into savagery. This was a revelation onceupon a time, apparently, though anyone who's ever watched little kids at play should know they can becasually cruel to one another.
This adaptation by Nigel Williams has a few good ideas, mainly adding in some evocative dance and
choreography. They should have gone further and treated the story as pure myth and ritual. The lads --led by handsome young Alistair Toovey -- give their all, but to no avail. It doesn't help that this story inparticular should go barreling towards its conclusion in about 80 minutes, not pause for a 20-minutebreak. Tech credits however are superb. You walk into the theater and say, "Wow, what an amazing set!"thanks to smoke and wreckage that makes the stage look like the opening scene of TV's Lost,  complete
with a plane snapped in two. Unfortunately, you leave with the same thought, "what an amazing set."
That is never a good sign, though full credit to designer Jon Bausor.
OPERATION GREENFIELD  ** 1/2 out of ****
Little Bulb Theatre  is a small company that's proving adept at both unique theatrical offerings and
gaining attention for them, both key elements to survival in fringe theater. They are certainly one to
watch.
Their latest show is Operation Greenfield  at Soho Theatre.  It's a goofy little tale about four kids growing
up in a small town in England who form a Christian rock group to compete in the local battle of the
bands contest. The script boasts a number of ideas, none of them fully developed. Music as life-changingexperience has its fullest treatment when they unexpectedly dive into a David Bowie tune and have theirminds blown; it is the show's most theatrical and satisfying moment. However, they soon retreat tocalmer musical waters. Music as dangerous gateway to experimentation gets brief tryouts thanks to oneband member being tempted by cigarettes and two of the girls suddenly making out. This too goes

Mostly, the piece is a showcase for its four performers (three women and one man), all of whom have
amusing moments. At times, they play "children" for laughs, rather than specific characters. Happily,they're quite funny at it. The battle of the bands climax is very satisfying and brings the show to a perfect
conclusion...which they then spoil by performing another very out of character musical number that just
drags out the ending. The real star here is director Alexander Scott who keeps things moving briskly andinventively throughout.
