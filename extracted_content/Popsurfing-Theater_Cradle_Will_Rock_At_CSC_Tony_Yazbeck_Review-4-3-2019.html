THEATER: "THE CRADLE WILL ROCK" PUTS
YOU TO SLEEP
THE  CRADLE  WILL  ROCK  * 1/2 out of ****
CLASSIC  STAGE  COMPANY
Our New Gilded Age is surely the perfect time to resurrect Marc
Blitzstein's The  Cradle  Will  Rock.  But time is not kind to agitprop in
general or this pamphlet of a show in particular.   Like me, you may
long to be roused, ready to look for the union label, mount the
barricades and get fired up over injustice. But a lack of drama,
character or story leaves nothing here but long speeches and short
sketches. Worse, the fatal lack of melodies for the handful of songs onhand won't even let you walk out humming a catchy tune. Is harmonytoo bourgeois?
It's a landmark show, of course, whose premiere (directed by Orson
Welles!)   proved electrifying for how  it was performed (rather than the
show itself). That story is so famous it inspired a so-so film about it byTim Robbins. This "play in music" (a musical ain't serious enough, I
guess) was the first in Broadway history to garner an original cast
recording. And now I know why -- despite all this laudable backstory--the show itself is rarely performed.
We begin with a desperate woman on the streets, ready to sell herself
for half a buck. But the man Mol solicits says that's too much. What's a
human's body worth? Not much more than a human's dignity,
apparently. A cop breaks up this sad affair, only to pressure Moll (LaraPulver, who played  the woman from Sherlock ) into having sex with
him. She refuses, he tosses her into the clink and a passel of local
dignitaries are   bundled into jail as well. They're anonymous members
of the Liberty Committee, middle-class   toadies who do the bidding of
Mr. Mister in "Steeltown, U.S.A." This already sounds like more plot
than we're given: everyone is a type, a cardboard cutout   for damningMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>or praising and no one is better at both than Larry Foreman (Tony
Yazbeck), the man urging workers to unite   so they can stand up for
decent wages and safe working conditions.

A mock trial ensues, with little vignettes depicting doctors, educators,
religious leaders, artists and anyone else you can name   knuckling
under to Mr. Mister (David Garrison) out of avarice or fear. Thatmanipulator showers the stage with so much cash, you feel half the
show is spent with people on their knees scooping up piles of dough.
Frankly, times are so hard and the bills on display so realistic looking,I was half tempted to join them.
Speeches can be entertaining and informative. Not The  Cradle  Will
Rock,  which states the obvious in as obvious a fashion as possible and
then restates it again for good measure. Director John Doyle does
exactly what one would expect -- he directs fluidly and simply, with oildrums stacked up or slapped down to serve as seats, while the castmoves about and enacts their various fables. Seemingly everyone can
play the piano located near   the back of the stage, so thank god there
are no union rules insisting they can't each pitch in when needed.
The actors are mostly capable and do what they can. Rema Webb
garners the only applause of the night for a song, thanks to her strong
voice; Garrison's icy exterior matches the icy heart of Mister and
Eddie Cooper offers about ten shades of conflicted in each scene heinhabits.
Pulver and Yazbeck get the bulk of attention. She proves very
appealing, even though her would-be sex worker   is quickly reduced to
the sidelines, watching others act out their falls from grace while she
looks hopefully towards   the future. Yazbeck however is quite stirring
as first a broken man and then the rabble-rousing union organizer  
Foreman. Blitzstein gives him nothing but speechifying but that
speechifying can be damn persuasive in the right hands. Yazbeck is
fiery, funny, moving and shakes up the evening as much as he can. He▼  April (10)
