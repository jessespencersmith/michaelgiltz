From the Publisher: The future waits for no one. In this new world, speed
and efficiency are everything, and the populace zooms along in a
perpetually stimulated haze. Angela thinks she's the only person in her
familyâmaybe the only person on the planetâwho sees anything wrong withthis picture. But the truth is she's not alone. Angela finds herself recruitedinto a resistance movement where the key to rebellion is taking things
slow. In their secret underground hideout, they create a life unplugged
from the rapid-fire culture outside. Can they free the rest of the worldbefore the powers that be shut down their utopian experiment? Fromrevolutionary and award-winning playwright Adam Rapp and veterancartoonist and animator Mike Cavallaro comes Decelerate Blue , a dark,
breath-taking new vision of an all-too-plausible future for America.

What We Say
Feel like things are speeding up? That life is moving faster and faster? Clearly playwright Adam Rapp agrees. He and artist
Mike Cavallaro have collaborated on this near-future dystopian nightmare where speed is all and society is super-caffeinated, marketed, analyzed and kept in line. Even heartbeats are monitored so they don't get unacceptably low and
everyone ends their sentences/complete thoughts with "go" so the people they're talking to don't have to waste any time
wondering if the person is done. Go. (They would have used "over" like on walkie talkies, but obviously "go" is one syllableand "over" is two. So "go" wins. Go.) It's a somewhat familiar complaint with our rebellious teenage heroine Angela barelyShare This Book

<p>able to hide her contempt for how things are. (Her parents must repeatedly urge her not to drop her "go"s.) Toss in a
banned book that predicted this Orwellian nightmare and is inspiring a rebellion, link Angela up with those fighters
(including another young woman that becomes Angela's first romance) and you've got yourself a story. At first, "Decelerate
Blue" seemed a bit rushed to me. Ultimately, the single volume one-and-done nature of this tale proves a strength,especially with an ending that is open to interpretation both sad and lovely. Rapp has fun with the dialogue -- societyfrowns on adverbs but the rebels frown on contractions, so in a subtle way they're just as rigid. Cavallaro's work moves thestory along though at a few key points I was disoriented as to what exactly was being depicted. But their vision unites
beautifully with a few splashes of color at that finale. To pull a few words from the rebels' tribute to adjectives,
"Decelerate Blue" is impious, disorderly, imaginate and irreverent. Go. -- Michael Giltz
