            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 7Ken Burns At PBS Through 2022Ken Burns has signed a 15 year deal with PBS. Clearly, he isn't goinganywhere, not when PBS lets him devote 14 hours (as they should) to adocumentary on World War II, which launches in September. Somereporters actually questioned whether that was too much time. Arethey idiots? Do they seriously think 14 hours is too much time to devoteto such a seminal, world-changing event? I've got DVD boxed setscovering only PART of the war (Like "Victory At Sea") that arecompletely engrossing and if anything too short that are just as long ifnot longer. Other upcoming projects Burns wants to tackle includeProhibition and the national parks system. What about The GreatDepression? As for all the fuss about salty language in the series, I hopePBS stays firm. Not one child in America is going to sit through 14hours of "The War" in order to get a thrill from hearing someone say"fuck." And if they did, that would be wonderful -- just like the kidswho went to see Truffaut and Fellini for the naughty bits and foundthemselves exposed to great art. A serious legal wrangle over this issuecould end the FCC's reign of terror for good.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
