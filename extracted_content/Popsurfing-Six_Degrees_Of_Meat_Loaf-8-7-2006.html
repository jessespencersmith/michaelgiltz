            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  A U G U S T  0 7 ,  2 0 0 6Six Degrees Of Meat LoafThe LA Times suggests Meat Loaf is the King of the Pop CultureUniverse, giving career boosts to all and sundry. Cher went on to moviestardom and a serious solo career after singing the terrific duet "DeadRinger For Love" with Mr. Loaf. (Pia Zadora also appeared in thevideo.) Michael Bay directed the contradictory video "I Would DoAnything For Love (But I Won't Do That)" before breaking intosummer blockbusters. Angelina Jolie had an early bit of exposureplaying the abused daughter in the video for "Rock N Roll DreamsCome True." But they get it wrong when dipping into sports: they sawMr. Loaf failed to make the Dodgers World Series champs even thoughhe featured the Voice of the Dodgers Vin Scully in the video for"Paradise By The Dashboard Lights" in 1978. The Dodgers got to theWorld Series but lost. But who did they lose to? The New York Yankees-- and it's the voice of the Yankees Phil Rizutto who does the play byplay during the song. So Loaf wins again. I guess this means MarionRaven really will be a big star in the US.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
