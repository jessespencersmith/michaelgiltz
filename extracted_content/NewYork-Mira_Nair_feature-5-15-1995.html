            <p>Talel1l Dreaming in Cuban 
hough 37-year-old director Mira Nair began her career with 
low-key documentaries about India, she casually uses Mar­
quezian magical realism and the kind of heightened romanti-
cism found in Like Water for Chocolate for her latest movie, The 
Perez Family. It tells the story of a Cuban refugee (AHred Molina, pic­
tured at right with Marisa Tomei) who arrives in Miami after decades 
of prison, hoping to reunite with his wife (Anjelica Huston). Those fa­
miliar with Nair's feature debut, Salaam Bombay!, a painfully real­
istic look at street children, will be especially surprised by the fan­
tastic touches of Perez, such as when Molina's breaking heart is 
symbolized by blood oozing out of his chest. "This one, I felt, was giving itself over to magic," says Nair, "not know­
ing where dream ends and reality begins. Cubans are definitely given to that condition. They're a passionate culture." 
Nair is equally passionate about plunging ahead with a career happily delayed by the birth of her son after 1991's Mis­
sissippi Masala. She's considering a Bob Marley project and has already started worll on The Kama-sutra, an Indian 
Dangerous Uaisons set in the thirteenth century and based on the famous Sanskrit text, which details codes of be­
havior but is best known to westerners for a section on sexual techniques. "People are always tittering about the ti-
tie," she says. "But I'm sure they'll run to see it." MICHAD. GILTZ</p>
