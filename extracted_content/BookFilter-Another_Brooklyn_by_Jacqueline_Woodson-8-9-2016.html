From the Publisher: The acclaimed New York Times  bestselling and
National Book Award–winning author of Brown Girl Dreaming  delivers her
first adult novel in twenty years. Running into a long-ago friend sets
memory from the 1970s in motion for August, transporting her to a time
and a place where friendship was everything—until it wasn’t. For August
and her girls, sharing confidences as they ambled through neighborhoodstreets, Brooklyn was a place where they believed that they werebeautiful, talented, brilliant—a part of a future that belonged to them.
But beneath the hopeful veneer, there was another Brooklyn, a dangerous
place where grown men reached for innocent girls in dark hallways, whereghosts haunted the night, where mothers disappeared. A world wheremadness was just a sunset away and fathers found hope in religion. LikeLouise Meriwether’s Daddy Was…

What We Say
Anyone who has read the young adult or middle grade fiction of Jacqueline Woodson won't be surprised by the sophisticated
intelligence at play in this novel about kids, which is more reverie than narrative. Anyone who has read the fiction foradults by Woodson won't be surprised by the vivid immediacy of her prose or how marvelously she captures the quicksilver
emotions of a girl becoming a young woman. How fresh and vivid it feels to be alive when the entire world can be
encompassed on a single block in New York City. And how sadly inevitable when that block cannot keep out the realities oflife. Woodson's newest work is brief but overbrimming with the sights and sounds, the taste and feel of childhood --Share This Book

<p>specifically the childhood of a young girl of color coming of age in Brooklyn in the 1970s. Her name is August and she
watches over her little brother while their dad toils away at an unforgiving job. Nothing and everything happens, with
Woodson moving the story forward in an imagistic rush drunk on the world August soaks up with the eagerness of a future
artist. Her little brother stares out of the window at the block they are forbidden to walk on until it finally shatters intopieces; their dad gives in to the inevitable and sets them free. August stares in wonder at a trio of confident beautiful girlsnamed Sylvia, Gigi and Angela -- and then becomes one of them, linking arms and defiantly laughing as they stare down themen and boys who admire and taunt and prey (and pray) upon them. So much happens and Woodson delivers it all with
poetic ease, from her father's conversion to Islam to white flight to the dreams of August and her friends. They dare
dreams and dangers, ranging from a cobbler who offers a quarter just to see their panties to the boys who love them andoffer the physical pleasure of romance but want more and more and then just a little bit more. It's a bold, beautiful,bewitching work, both heartbreaking and strong because Woodson remembers it all. -- Michael Giltz
