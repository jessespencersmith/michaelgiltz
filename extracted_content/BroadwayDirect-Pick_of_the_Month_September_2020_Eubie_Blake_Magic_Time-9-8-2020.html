BookFilter picks the best new theater book, exclusively for BroadwayDirect readers.This month, we’ve got two books to highlight:Eubie Blake: Rags, Rhythm, and RaceBy Richard Carlin & Ken Bloom $35, Oxford University Press Out now Magic TimeBy Edwin Wilson $29.95, Smith & Kraus Out now The theater will be back. You need no more proof than two new books detailing its long,indomitable history. Eubie Blake set Broadway on !re with the ground-breaking musicalShu!e Along, the show that helped launch Josephine Baker among others. Then he fadedfrom view…only to get his due late in life. And of course, Shu!e Along was reimagined asone of the great new musicals of the 21st century. Richard Carlin and Ken Bloom cover themaking of that original landmark in-depth in this biography. But they also cover Blake’sentire life and the world he fought and "ourished in. It’s a serious work of scholarshipworthy of his impact. And if you think you miss theater, you’ve got nothing on critic and scholar Edwin Wilsonwho misses both current theater and the grander, better theater he covered for decadesas the critic for the Wall Street Journal. Wilson is a mainstay of college courses where histextbook The Theater Experience is in its 14th edition. Wilson o#ers up a grab bag ofmaterial here, from a memoir detailing his lifelong passion for dramatics to how hestumbled into that job at WSJ (we should all be so lucky), some kvetching (why don’t peopledress up for shows anymore, he harrumphs) and a collection of some of his mostinsightful reviews. Wilson has done it all and interviewed everyone, so whether you knowhim via a college elective or found him on YouTube where Wilson’s long-running PBS showSpotlight can be found, Magic Time !lls in the rest of his enviable career.
