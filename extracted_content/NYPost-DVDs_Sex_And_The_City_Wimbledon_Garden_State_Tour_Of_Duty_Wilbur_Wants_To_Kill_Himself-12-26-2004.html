VI Sex and the City: 
Season Six, 
PartlWo *** HBO, $49.99 
A sentimental farewell 
to those foul-mouthed, 
~-"';' -I lovable gals that defmed 
New York City -or at 
least a very tony; 
fashionable section of it. 
This fInal set of the last 
part of the last season 
has alternate endings (all 
of them red herrings 
since Carrie and Mr. Big 
was always the way to 
go); an hour-long panel 
discussion with Sarah 
Jessica Parker, the 
producer and the 
writers; and some 
goodbye documentaries 
with everyone in the cast 
on their best behavior. A 
"""'-__ ---' good way to go out. 
Wimbledon **'/2 Universal, $29.98 
Paul Bettany doesn't quite hit 
the Hugh Grant in "Four 
Weddings" jackpot, but he is 
very charming indeed as an 
aging tennis superstar who has 
one last run at a Grand Slam. His 
run of luck begins when Bettany 
be-comes entangled with the 
number-one player on the 
women's circuit (Kirsten Dunst, 
who has a gift for picking roles 
suited to her). Modest extras 
include a commentary track 
with the director and Bettany. 
Also out: the Will Ferrell 
comedy '~chorman: The 
Legend of Ron Burgundy" 
(Universal, $29.99). 
Tour of Duty: 
Second Season 
*** Columbia TriStar, $36.95 
America fIrst dealt with the 
reality of Vietnam by watching 
"M*A*S*H," a show set during 
the Korean War. Perhaps it can 
wrestle with Iraq by revisiting 
"Tour of Duty," the tough­
minded drama set in Vietnam. 
The second season fmds the raw 
recruits turning into hardened 
veterans trying to survive both 
physically and emotionally. Kim 
Delaney joins the cast as a 
reporter. Also out: "Rumpole of 
the Bailey: Set 2" (A&E, $69.95), 
the fIrst appearance on DVD of 
seasc;ms three and four featwing 
the beloved barrister Garden State 
** Fox, $29.98 
Zach Braff, of the TV dramedy 
"Scrubs," gets his chance to 
direct and makes the most of it 
with this movie about a minor 
actor who comes home for his 
mom's funeral and decides to 
skip the lithium and other drugs 
that have been medicating him 
for his entire life. The story is 
offbeat in its details. Braff 
certainly knows 
talent: the cast 
is filled with 
performers like 
Natalie 
Portman (who 
looks about 15), 
Ian Holm, and 
•... E3 Peter Sarsgaard 
while the 
soundtrack boasts everyone 
from the Shins to Nick Drake. 
Wilbur 
(Wants To Kill Himself) ***'h Sundance 26.99 
Director Lone ScherfIg had a 
minor hit with "Italian for 
Beginners" and followed it up 
with this witty drama. one of the 
best movies of the year even 
though it came and went in the 
blink of an eye. Wilbur wants to 
kill himself, just like Harold in 
"Harold & Maude." His brother 
tries to fmd a girlfriend for 
Wilbur, thinking that might 
solve the problem.</p>
