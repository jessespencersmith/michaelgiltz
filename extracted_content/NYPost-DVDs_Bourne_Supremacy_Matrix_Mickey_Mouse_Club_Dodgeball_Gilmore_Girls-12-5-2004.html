Ultimate Matrix 
Collection **'/' Warner Bros, $79.92 
CLEARLY the mystique _of 
"The Matrix" was spoiled by 
two vastly inferior sequels. 
Having its innovative action 
scenes copied or spoofed 
repeatedly didn't help, either. 
But some of that hipness is 
regained with this overstuffed 
boxed set with 35 hours of 
deleted scenes, 
documentaries, animated 
shorts and -boldest of all -
commentary tracks from 
critics who didn't like the 
movies. 
The Mickey 
Mouse Club 
** Walt Disney, $32.99 
WITH entire seasons of TV 
shows available in boxed sets, 
it's a shame Disney is only 
releasing the first five 
episodes -week one -of 
"The Mickey Mouse Club." (It 
ran from 1955 to 1959,-so 
they've got hundreds of hours 
in the vault.) At this rate, it'll 
take 13 volumes just to cover 
the first year. But Annette and 
the gang are still fun. Far 
better values are "Mickey 
Mouse in Black and White: 
Volume Two" and "The 
Complete Pluto: Volume One," 
both jammed with cartoons 
and extras. The Bourne 
Supremacy ***'/' Universal. $29.98 
A whip-smart 
thriller with Matt 
Damoll returning as 
thf forgetful Jason 
Bourne, who is forced 
cut of hidmg by a 
vengeful government 
Director Paul 
Greengrass keeps 
everything thrilling, 
including a car-chase 
scene in Moscow that 
is one for the ages 
(and is analyzed in 
the extras, along with 
Damon's fight 
training and a bridgeÂ­
chase scene). Another 
fme thriller just out: 
"Infernal Affairs" 
(Miramax, $29.99), 
from Hong Kong. 
Dodgeball 
* Fox, $29.98 
. A lazy, dumb comedy that 
gIves lazy, dumb comedies a 
bad name. Vince Vaughn and 
his gang of misfits must win a 
dodgeball competition to keep 
his gym from being bought out 
by Ben Stiller. One three 
minute sequence with Rip 
Torn throwing wrenches at 
Vaughn's team to sharpen 
their reflexes is funny. The 
rest is distressingly stupid. 
Extras include commentary 
tracks, deleted scenes and -
on the DVD-ROM -the 
script, which is so banal and 
basic it could have fit on a 
napkin. 
Gilmore Girls 
Season Two 
**** Warner Bros., $59.98 
ANYONE enjoying the 
newly resurgent "Gilmore 
Girls" should check out the far 
superior 
second 
season, 
when this 
series 
could do 
no wrong. Extras ""-_____ ..&..-::....---.--J 
include ''A Film By Kirk." Also 
out: "24 Season Three" (Fox, 
$69.98), "Carnivale" (HBO, 
$99.98) and "M*A*S*H Season 
Seven" (Fox, $39.98).</p>
