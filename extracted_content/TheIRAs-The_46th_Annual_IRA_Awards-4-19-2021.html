THE IRAS SAY #METOO! -- BUT IN A GOOD
WAY -- AT THE 46TH ANNUAL IRA AWARDS
 The 46st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS --
2020/EARLY 2021 Releases
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society launched in 1976
when it proudly named Stanley Kubrick's  Barry Lyndon  the best film
of the previous year. Officially known as the New York Independent
Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs -- they are
more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial
than the LA Film Critics and even more loyal to their favorites than the
Golden Globes. The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best
movies released commercially on any platform in 2020 (ish).
Without further ado, the IRA goes to... 
 
Best Picture:  Kajillionaire
Best Director:  Miranda July for  Kajillionaire
Best Actor: Bartosz Bielenia  for Corpus Christi 
Best Actress:  Kate Winslet for  Ammonite

(tie)  
Best Screenplay:   Miranda July for  Kajillionaire

Promising Young Woman 
Best Production Design: Mayne Berke for  Sylvie's Love and Sergey
Ovanov for  Beanpole (tie)

Dramamine Award (The Movie That Made Us Sick):  Mank
Mechanical Actress: Elizabeth Moss  for The Invisible Man and Shirley  
Mechanical Actor: James Corden for  The Prom
The 2019 IRAs took place in March in NYC right before lockdown. The
group approached a cinematic Singularity with a half human/half
machine ceremony unlike any in its existence.  The typical gathering
over the years might feature one or at most two virtual attendees. Last
year,  it morphed into a Kubrickian spectacle with a circle of chairs
featuring a human seated next to a laptop next to a human next to a
tablet next to a human a smartphone and so on. It was...surreal but no
stranger than what everyone would deal with for the next year of the
pandemic. 
This year, the 2020 IRAs took place later than ever with an April 17,
2021 ceremony. The eligible films covered a rough, much-debated
calendar stretching from January of 2020 to February (ish) of 2021 and
included any film you could see any place, anywhere and any time, be it
Netflix or digital download or a drive-in or -- on blessed but rare
occasions -- an indoor movie theater. 
The actual gathering was digital only, with everyone Zooming in from
their respective homes, cars and spider holes. The titular Ira zoomed in
from a surprisingly spacious pad set decorated by Spike Jonze,
maintaining a Sphinx-like silence throughout. The quips, insults and
asides that make the IRAs the IRAs became entangled in digital delays,
unintentional self-muting and other mechanical tripwires. Worse,
Official Stenographer Alex abandoned his usual role of transcribing the
choicest comments for posterity (or at least an amusing recap the next
day). George suggested he simply record the entire event and pull out
the best quotes later, but for legal reasons, that was abandoned.   
On the other hand, zoom meetings are so familiar to everyone that
members who often restricted themselves to submitting a paper ballot
took part again for the first time in literally decades. (Okay, 18 years to
be exact.) Who knew Adam sported a mustache? Mark! David! And
Julia and Jim in the role of UN observers! Here's hoping everyone
takes part any way they can in 2022 AND that most of us are together
in the same damn room. 
Our dream that a zoom gathering might proceed with alacrity was soon
dashed. Evening became morning as the voting veered from this year's
best to this year's worst and a first impressions take on the best of the
2010s. 
And now a blow-by-blow description of the night, in order of voting.
We begin, as always, with the category of Best Costumes. Instead of our
traditional first vote led by the titular Ira, we began alphabetically with
Aaron to Adam to Alex and so on.  The IRA goes to...
BEST COSTUME
1. Michael O'Connor for Ammonite  -- 24 pts (out of a possible
40-45 pts.)
2. Jacqueline Durran for  Lovers Rock and Alex Wheatle  -- 23 pts. 
3. Olga Smirnova for  Beanpole -- 18 pts.
4. Phoenix Mellow for  Sylvie's Love -- 14 pts.
5. Jennifer Johnson for Kajillionaire -- 12 pts.
POINT OF ORDER: This year eight to nine ballots were in play
throughout the night. (Some voters popped in and out as family made
its demands, as families will, zoom meeting or no zoom meeting.)  With
a top score for each nominee of 5 pts, the maximum any one nominee
could achieve in any category was 45 pts. when everyone was voting.
Voting begins with each member naming their top pick. If a majority of
the ballots name the same winner, this triumph is acknowledged as a
win "by acclamation." However a winner may be chosen (by
acclamation or by a complete tally), this is followed by the automatic
vote to rescind.
The Vote To Rescind is offered after every single category. Why? Once
the totals are in, members may feel the actual winner doesn't reflect the
best choice. Or perhaps they prefer the runner-up. After the winner is
announced, members are asked to consider a Vote To Rescind. If a
majority of the members actively voting support it, the winner is
rescinded and the runner-up is made the official champion. This is
followed by  another  vote to rescind until the victor is confirmed. It's a
somewhat controversial tactic. But it rarely comes into play more than
once a year and in a spirit of we're-all-in-this-together, the Vote To
Rescind played no role this year until one brief appearance in the
negative awards that end the night.  
NOTE: Like Presidential nominating conventions of yore, the real
action at the IRAs typically takes place in smoke-filled backrooms
where pressure is applied, deals are made and better angels are
fruitlessly appealed. OK, there's no smoke and we're usually eating cake
and gobbling snacks but deals are struck. OK, I'll give you points for
production design for -- ugh -- Wes Anderson -- but you have to give
me points in the screenplay category for that four hour Albanian
drama! It's fun!  It works! And this year, it happened by text if at all.
Not. The. Same. 
Runner-ups  Lovers Rock and Alex Wheatle  are two episodes in the five
part TV anthology series Small Axe. They prove the IRAs recent open-
mindedness towards streaming was prescient, bold and ultimately no
big deal. The major awards followed in our wake this year since the
pandemic made insisting on a theatrical release nigh on impossible.
Sure, the Oscars may take one step back in 2022 after this year's
bowing to reality, but the door (or in this case, the window) has been
opened. 
Who cares what platform a work of art is released on? If HBO MAX
buys a movie at Sundance, why does that automatically mean the
project is "TV" and not a movie? But if a streamer like Netflix buys it
and opens it day and date in a theater it's a ..."streamer"? But not a
"movie" by Oscar standards? And if it's bought by IFC and plays one
week on one screen in New York City before heading to streaming
anyway a few months then suddenly later it's a movie again? Yep, it
made no sense to us either. So we changed the rules, not without much
hard-wringing. The result? One year after the new rules allow any
movie available to IRA members as a whole in any way to be eligible, all
sorts of films seen via Netflix or VOD or the like pepper the list. In
short, if you can see it and convince other IRAS voters that what you
saw is  and a movie -- and a good movie,  at that -- it's fair game. Thus
three parts of a five part anthology series that aired on BBC One and
Amazon Prime are in the mix throughout the evening. And no one
blinked an eye. 
Finally, Ammonite  scored early while Michael's favorite Beanpole  was
in the mix and drew admiring comments from a number of quarters.
Meanwhile, Kajillionaire, a  quirky, little-discussed  comedy by writer-
director Miranda July, popped in with a modest, last place finish for its
costumes. Hey, that was a great track suit. 
 BEST EDITING
1. Andr ew Patterson (as Junius Tully)  for The Vast Of Night   -- 20
pts.
2. (tie) Gabriel Rhodes for  Time  -- 15 pts.
    (tie)  Chloé Zhao   for Nomadland  -- 15 pts.
4. Robin Hill for  Beats  --12 pts.
5. Dana Bunescu, George Cragg and Alexander Nanau for  Collective  -
- 9 pts.
NOTE: When editing was added to the list of categories that the IRAs
vote on, some concern arose it might be dominated by nonfiction films.
Even though many docs have a script, by nature they are often
discovered after filming has ended. Recent years have proven narrative
films can hold their own. Yes, the docs  Time  and  Collective  (which was
edited by a collective, apparently) scored points. But the overall winner
is the low-budget, little-seen yet highly admired (by us) sci-fi flick  The
Vast Of Night. It's a smart film made on a dime that  shows off great
talent in editing, cinematography, acting and especially the co-writing,
editing and directing of Andrew Patterson.  The Vast Of Night  is the
sort of film the IRAs can usefully shine a spotlight on. Check it out! And
Patterson is one to watch. 
BEST SCORE/USE OF MUSIC
1. Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran for Ammonite   -
- 27 pts.
2. (tie) Emile Mosseri for  Kajillionaire and  Minari -- 17 pts.
3. (tie)  Ed Bailie and Abi Leland, music supervisors  for Lovers Rock  -- 17
pts.
4. Stephen Hindman and Penelope Trappes for  Beats  --13 pts.
5. Lin-Manuel Miranda for  Hamilton  -- 10 pts.
NOTE: How do you compare the score for  Ammonite  to the soundtrack
of late 1970s Britain deep reggae and "lovers rock" songs? By re-
naming your award "Best Score/Use Of Music" and letting the4 gods
sort it out. Lovers Rock definitely serves up the better playlist for
outside-of-movie listening. But in fairness to the others, its mosts
transcendent moment during the evening long house party is when the
movie drops the actual song playing out of the mix and all you see and
hear are the people in the room dancing and moving and singing along
to the song we're no longer hearing. It's the best moment in the movie
and captures better than any other moment in cinema this year the joy
of communal pleasure in a song...and yet there's not a note playing!
Genius.  Beats is a Scottish film not enough people saw since it popped
onto our radar late in the day. But the few who saw it mostly loved it
and  Beats is another little-known flick worth checking out a reason the
IRAs are worth doing. 
BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN
1. Mayne Berke for  Sylvie's Love (tie)  -- 19 pts.
    Sergey Ovanov for Beanpole (tie)  -- 19 pts.
3. Sarah Finlay for  Ammonite  -- 15 pts.
4. Steven Jones-Evans for  Relic -- 13 pts.
5. (tie) Adam Dietrich for  The Vast Of Night  -- 11 pts. 
    (tie) Sam Lisenco for  Kajillionaire -- 11 pts.
NOTE: The Harlem-set period drama  Sylvie's Love shows the Brits
don't have a patent on music-centric films of romance set in the black
community. Tied for first is the smashing Russian
drama  Beanpole, which has an AMAZING production
design.  Ammonite is close behind, but some films are strong in the tech
awards and then soon fade away. Horror flick gets some love -- it will
receive more later -- and  The Vast Of Night shows it might be a comer.
Meanwhile, Miranda July's  Kajillionaire is in last place again. Keep
moving, nothing to see here, move along please. 
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
1. Benjamin Kracun  for Beats and Monsoon and Promising
Young Woman  -- 24 pts.
2. Kseniya Sereda for  Beanpole -- 15 pts.
3. Andrey Naydenov for  Dear Comrades! -- 12 pts.
4. Stéphanie Fontaine for  Ammonite -- 11 pts.
5. Miguel I. Littin-Menz for  The Vast Of Night  -- 9 pts.
NOTE: Ok, so the crew pushing  Beats isn't done yet as it scores what
would prove the indie's biggest win of the night. When an artist is
involved with more than one film, we honor that person's entire work
in the period of eligibility UNLESS a vote is taken to specifically
remove a second or third (or fourth) film from the role of honor. Since
cinematographer Benjamin "release the" Kracun worked on three
admired films, he jumped to the top of this category for  Beats,
Promising Young Woman and  Monsoon. It was pointed out that
Kracun merely photographed the Cary Grant-handsome actor Henry
Golding in  Monsoon and doesn't actually deserve any credit for how
appealing Golding is, but to no avail. Again, three favorites of Michael
are in the mix, with  The Vast Of Night and  Ammonite making the list
while his favorite  Beanpole is in second place again. This is proving to
be a very good night indeed. Director Andrey Konchalovskiy's late
career success  Dear Comrades! benefitted from a strong campaign by
Greg, shining a light on a career some of us summed up with the good
B movie  Runaway Train. He is indeed the older brother of Nikita
Mikhalkov, a tiresome nationalist whose politics are violently opposite
to those of the typical IRA voter. After much back and forth, we
couldn't determine Konchalovskiy's leanings but  Dear Comrades! is
certainly no ode to Mother Russia. Sorry  Dear Comrades!, the night
can belong to only one Russian film **smirk** and that film
is Beanpole.   
BEST SCREENPLAY
1. Miranda July for  Kajillionaire   -- 25 pts.
2. Lee Isaac Chung for  Minari  -- 16 pts.
3. Mateusz Pacewicz for  Corpus Christi -- 14 pts.
4. Evan Morgan for  The Kid Detective -- 11 pts.
5. Francis Lee for  Ammonite -- 10 pts.
NOTE: Oops. The also-ran  Kajillionaire vaults to the top with a
commanding win for Best Screenplay. Director Miranda July's offbeat
sensibility is surely the film's strong suit and it has a lovely grace note
at the end that makes this her most emotionally engaging and sweet
film to date. So fair is fair. It has to win something. The subtle work
for Minari  is a worthy honorable mention, while  Ammonite is still a
player. Two movies gain traction: the excellent Polish film  Corpus
Christi and the delightful genre flick  The Kid Detective. What if
Encyclopedia Brown grew up, still wanted to solve crimes and everyone
around him kept saying, "It's not cute anymore!" That's the premise
of The Kid Detective" which grows from that amusing premise into a
genuine noir boasting a career-best performance from the very
appealing Adam Brody. That's the way we do it in the O.C. bitch! But
where the heck is  Beanpole? 
BEST NONFICTION FILM 
1. Dick Johnson Is Dead  (tie)   -- 18 pts.  
    My Octopus Teacher (tie)   -- 18 pts.
3. Collective -- 17 pts.
4. Time -- 13 pts.
5. Crip Camp -- 10 pts.
NOTE: The Best Nonfiction Film is a recent add to the IRAs and not
without controversy (of course), since creating a category like this
almost ensures a nonfiction film won't win the much-desired top prize
for Best Film.  It was another banner year for documentary films. If this
hasn't already been dubbed a Golden Age for docs, it's been so dubbed
now. These five films could easily be expanded to ten without blinking
an eye. The two winners were tub-thumped by Aaron right to victory
and deservedly so.  Collective is perhaps the front runner for the
Academy Award but My Octopus Teacher is coming up strong
while  Crip Camp and  Time both have passionate adherents. All five are
absolutely worth your time, as are the five flicks picked down below for
Best Picture.  
FOOD BREAK
Andy offered some digital cake to the zoomers. A sweet gesture indeed.
But....  Not. The. Same. And then action resumes!
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
1. Robyn Nevin  for Relic  -- 20 pts.
2. Vasilisa Perelygina for  Beanpole -- 14 pts.
3. (tie) Lesley Manville for  Let Him Go  -- 10 pts.   
    (tie) Amanda Seyfried for  Mank -- 10 pts.
    (tie) Debra Winger for  Kajillionaire -- 10 pts.
    (tie) Yuh-Jung Youn for  Minari -- 10 pts.
NOTE:  Beanpole is back, baby! No, it didn't win Best Supporting
Actress. That was the very IRA victory for Robyn Nevin in a horror flick
strongly backed by our Master of Ceremonies Alex.
But  Beanpole continues to score strongly as we hit the Big Six of acting,
directing and Best Picture.  Kajillionaire garnered more love but that
was a four way tie for third place. A fluke! Sure  Kajillionaire has
popped up in four categories, but so has  Beanpole. Soon, the dreams
for Beanpole will be dashed to the ground. Soon, but not yet.  
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
1. Glynn Turman  for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom  -- 20 pts.
2. Peter MacNeil for  The Kid Detective  -- 15 pts.
3. Richard Jenkins for  Kajillionaire -- 14 pts.
4. (tie) Alan Kim for  Minari --11 pts.
    (tie) Lorn Macdonald for  Beats -- 11  pts.
NOTE: I don't think a single IRA voter actually liked  Ma Rainey's
Black Bottom. But the fine actor Glynn Turman made the most of the
great playwright August Wilson's words and scored a Best Supporting
Actor IRA award, manic editing or no manic editing. Some argued that
surely the performance wasn't so good that we needed to bring
attention to a movie no one was recommending? Wouldn't it be better -
- and indeed more IRAnian -- to honor a great performance in the fun
flick  The Kid Detective, a movie we  could  heartily recommend to movie
lovers?   Sadly, this impeccable logic fell on deaf ears.
(Kajillionaire? Again??)
                                            
BEST ACTRESS
1. Kate Winslet for Ammonite  -- 24 pts.
2. Evan Rachel Wood for  Kajillionaire -- 23 pts.
3. Viktoria Miroschnichenko for  Beanpole -- 14 pts.
4. Maria Bakalova for  Borat Subsequent Moviefilm  --11 pts.
5. Carey Mulligan for  Promising Young Woman -- 8 pts.
NOTE: Kate Winslet's marvelous work in  Ammonite barely squeaked
out a victory over the deep-voiced,  poignant turn by Evan Rachel
Wood in  Kajillionaire. Barely . And the tall, gangly, unforgettable turn
by the titular star of  Beanpole? A very distant third. Michael began
cursing quietly under his breath. However, it's around this time and
category a momentous shift occurred in the Great Game of IRA award
politicking. Some IRA members are blissfully unconcerned with
influencing the outcome of the vote. They have their favorites for each
category and by god, they're sticking to them. Even if no one else has
even  seen  their favorite performance or heard the score they love and
switching votes around might mean their second-favorite score
triumphs and wins the IRA, they just won't do it. Their votes are their
votes and they're sticking to 'em. George and Andy are first among
equals in this purist approach to the IRAs, with George especially
determined to give his five points to that Belgian Holocaust drama that
played one week at Anthology Archives and which no one else has even
heard of, much less seen. But by god it has the best damn production
design and he's sticking with it! Pleas for him to strategize and fight for
victory rather than suffer yet another noble defeat always fell on
indifferent ears. Until now. This year, for some reason known only to
him and his G-d, George quietly but determinedly changed his five
point favorite from one pick that hadn't a chance in hell of triumphing
to another  pick that did indeed have a chance in hell of winning. Jaws
dropped. He embraced a new strategy and it was a beautiful thing to
see. Can Andy be far behind? Will the IRAs become even more
cutthroat in the future? We shall see.
BEST ACTOR
1. Bartosz Bielenia  for Corpus Christi   -- 23 pts.
2. Riz Ahmed for  Sound Of Metal   -- 29 pts.
3. Mads Mikkelsen for  Another Round-- 18 pts.
4. (tie) Adam Brody for  The Kid Detective-- 9 pts.
    (tie) Steve Yeun for  Minari -- 9 pts.
NOTE: Huzzah!  Corpus Christi is hardly unheralded: Poland chose it
as that country's entry for the Best International Film category at the
Academy Awards. Still, who in the West is touting the magnetic, fierce,
compassionate, star-making performance of Bartosz Bielenia as the
violent juvenile offender turned priest imposter? No one! No one, that
is, until the IRAs step in to save the day. Riz Ahmed is a worthy runner
up for the Oscar hopeful  Sound Of Metal. Plus, he'll be pleased to know
we honored his work years ago in the cult favorite  Nightcrawler. That
film will also be a major contender in our picks for the best movies of
the 2010s below. 
BEST DIRECTOR
1. Miranda July for  Kajillionaire  -- 20 pts.
2. Francis Lee for  Ammonite  -- 17 pts.
3. Kantemir Balagov for  Beanpole -- 13 pts.
4. Jan Komasa for  Corpus Christi -- 10 pts.
5. Andrey Konchalovskiy for  Dear Comrades! -- 9 pts.
NOTE: The IRA group is not  a signatory to any auteurist manifesto as
such, but Best Director and Best Picture often go hand in hand. Not
always, since runner-up Francis Lee will see her film  Ammonite fall to
#4 in the Best Picture round while Thomas Vinterberg barely made a
peep in Best Director and yet his film  Another Round damn near wins
Best Picture! What's going on? Just a last minute attempt by Michael to
stop the  Kajillionaire train in its tracks. No luck. If he symbolically laid
down across the tracks like some damsel in a silent one-reeler, Michael
was flattened as quickly and completely as a copper penny. How
'bout  Ammonite? (George admired Kate Winslet but not the
film.)  Another Round? Anybody?  Corpus Christi? Too little, too late.
On the bright side, July is only the third woman to win Best Director at
the IRAs, following Nadine Labaki for 2018's  Capernaum and Nancy
Savoca for 1993's  Household Saints. 
BEST PICTURE
1. Kajillionaire  -- 20 pts.
2. Another Round  -- 18 pts.
3. Beanpole  -- 14 pts.
4. Ammonite  -- 13 pts.
5. Corpus Christi  -- 9 pts.
And so  Kajillionaire wins the Top Prize.  Miranda July becomes the
third woman to win the IRA for Best Director and the second woman to
direct a Best Picture winner, after  Capernaum for 2018. Are the IRAs
waking up the importance of diversity? No, because the IRAs have a
long and proud history of embracing films, performances and technical
achievements by people of color, various sexual orientations and
women from all over the world. If anything, the weak representation of
women in the top prizes is a chicken and egg dilemma. The more
women get the opportunity to make movies, the more their work will be
recognized by the IRAs, where two of the last three years have seen
women triumph. Nonetheless, Michael is forced to point out that $500
a month is a LOT of money to pay for a living space regularly flooded
with pink suds. It beggars belief. 
FOOD BREAK 
A digital cake from Andy offered a byte or two for those not on a diet
and then it was back to the awards. Up next, our "negative" awards,
where we bitch about performances and movies that did not please us
at all. That's followed by our First Impressions vote on the Best Films
of the 2010s. It seems like only yesterday we were voting on the Best
Films of the Noughts. How quickly the years pass.... 
 
SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep)
1. Tenet  -- 23 pts.
2. Mank -- 18 pts.
3. The Trial Of The Chicago 7 -- 11 pts.
4. The Midnight Sky  -- 8 pts.
5. (tie)  Ammonite -- 5  pts.
    (tie)  Shirley -- 5 pts. 
    (tie)  Wolfwalkers -- 5 pts. 
             
DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick)
. Mank  -- 18 pts.
2. Wonder W oman 1984--  15 pts.
3. Da 5 Bloods --  10 pts.
4. Hillbilly Elegy -- 6  pts.
    The Pr om -- 20 pts. RESCINDED 
NOTE: Some felt trashing  The Pr om was too easy and a vote to rescind was
successful, putting our bllseye squarely on the back of  Mank.  Movies are
NEVER historically accurate but Pauline Kael's long-debunked theory on who
wrote  Citizen Kane  is a poor choice for basing a movie on that's geared to
movie buf fs who know better than anyone how dumb its premise actually
proved to be. So there! P .S. It's a sled.  
MECHANICAL ACTRESS
1. Elisabeth Moss for The Invisible Man  and Shirley  -- 23 pts.
2. Meryl Streep  for Let Them All Talk and The Prom  -- 17 pts.
3. Viola Davis for  Ma Rainey's Black Bottom --  15 pts.
4. Glenn Close for  Hillbilly Elegy -- 14  pts.
5. Nicole Kidman for  The Pr om --  10 pts.
MECHANICAL ACTOR
1. James Corden for The Prom  -- 22 pts.
2. Kenneth Branagh for  Tenet --  19 pts.
3. Gary Oldman for  Mank --  14 pts.
4. Tom Hanks for  Greyhound  and News Of The W orld --  12 pts.
5. Sacha Baron Cohen for  Borat Subsequent Movieﬁlm  and The T rial Of The
Chicago 7--  8 pts. 
FIRST  IMPRESSIONS: THE BEST  OF THE 2010s (2010-2019) 
1. A Separation  -- 33 pts. 
2. Nightcrawler  -- 32 pts. 
3. Moonlight  -- 31 pts. 
4. (tie)  Un Pr ophète  -- 30 pts. 
    (tie)  Tangerine  -- 30 pts. 
6. Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood  -- 29 pts. 
7. Laur ence Anyways  -- 26 pts. 
8. In Jackson Heights  -- 24 pts. 
9. The T ree Of Life  -- 20 pts. 
10. The T ribe -- 19 pts. 
NOTE: At the end of each decade, the IRAs of fer up their ﬁrst impressions of
the best ﬁlms of the past ten years. Members simply read of f their ten favorite
ﬁlms, ranking each ﬁlm so their top choice receives ten points, their second
choice nine points on down to one. Then we tot them up. Easy peasy! Except
even here Michael's campaigning fell short. He was hopeful  Mad Max: Fury
Road  could make the Top 10. But the stink of failure that clung to him after
that desperate attempt to stop a kajillion wins for  Kajillionair e made Michael's
push for Top 10 glory fall short. Ah well. As Doris Day sang, que sera sera. It's
an admirable Top 10 nonetheless. Anyone wanting to see some of the best
ﬁlms of the decade can start here with conﬁdence.

WHO OR WHAT ARE THE IRAS? A HISTORY
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the
best films of the year since 1976. Officially known as the New York
Independent Film Critics Awards -- but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs --
they are more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more
mercurial than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than
the Golden Globes. 
The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained
about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do
better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to
establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is
named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story
lost in the mist of time, alcohol and since it was the 1970s perhaps
cannabis.) The IRAs group has been profiled in  The New Yorker, so it
is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever heard of
it. Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have included
Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-selling
and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics,
screenwriters, budding playwrights, film scholars, plain old movie buffs
and so on. 
Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best movies of the
year. The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are
passionate film lovers. Many have careers involving the arts, but it's not
always easy to stay in the swim of things, to keep on top of the flood of
new releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA
members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a
time. The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in
theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) eventually on some
streaming service or DVD. Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay
committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their
college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life,
before jobs and family made frivolous claims on their time. So if you
want to stay on top of great cinema every year or explore its history,
there's no better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs. 
True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the
year than anyone else. But they've been doing it for decades so hey, it's
tradition!
