7/23/2005 12:43:00 PMHere's yet another example via the NYT of Bush's dangerouspropensity for perverting science for political purposes -- in thiscase via plans for a nuclear waste facility that could havedisastrous implications for millions of Americans.Naturally, a House subcommittee investigating these lies had tofile a subpoena to get the Energy Dept. to play ball. Lie and ifyou're caught in the lie -- stonewall. The whopper at the heartof this: the Energy Dept just wants to protect whistleblowers.Yeah, cause Bush loves whistleblowers.In a dispute that has lasted more than three months, theEnergy Department has resisted, and department officialshave complained about the committee's earlier release ofe-mail messages detailing the falsifications.In those e-mail messages government workers talked aboutmanipulating their work to meet quality-assurancestandards....The heart of the issue is government calculations abouthow fast radioactive material would dissolve intorainwater, percolate through the rock and then traveloutside the boundaries of the repository, which isabout 100 miles from Las Vegas.Wow, that's just the sort of study I'd feel comfortable with Bush'speople fudging the data on, wouldn't you? Maybe what happens inVegas will stay in Vegas because it's too sick to leave.
