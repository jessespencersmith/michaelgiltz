6/03/2005 05:26:00 PMIn classic Orwellian fashion, the far right hate group AmericanFamily Association is ending its boycott of Disney and declaringsuccess just a few days before the 15th Annual Gay Day pumpsmillions into Disney's theme parks. AFA president Tim Wildmonsaid the boycott had been a huge success.Oh, of course it has. Disney sent the career of out lesbian EllenDegeneres soaring with its massive popular hit Finding Nemo.Now Ellen is a daytime talk show fixture and Emmy winnerbeloved by moms and kids everywhere. Disney's family friendlysummer movie "Herbie: Fully Loaded" was directed by anotherout lesbian. And ABC is reaping the rewards of TV's biggestnew hit "Desperate Housewives," which has given a huge boostto its ratings thanks to its out creator Marc Cherry and steamystorylines about moms sleeping with (very hot) teenagegardeners and other high school guys who are gay and/orexperimenting just to drive their moms crazy. Yep, that boycottis going swimmingly -- they've certainly changed Disney'sbehavior.Why don't they just boycott America and be done with it?
