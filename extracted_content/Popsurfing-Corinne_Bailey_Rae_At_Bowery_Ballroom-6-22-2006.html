            <p>T H U R S D AY,  J U N E  2 2 ,  2 0 0 6Corinne Bailey Rae At Bowery BallroomA delightful UK singer, Corinne Bailey Rae has delivered what willdefinitely be one of the best CDs of the year. I interviewed this sweet,charming artist on Monday for the New York Post and went to catchher live act last night with my friend Janie. Janie hadn't heard thealbum and after the first song, she turned to me and said, "MarvinGaye." Indeed, you can hear all sorts of classic soul references whenlistening to Rae, from Gaye and Bill Withers to Nina Simone and (withher gorgeous finale "Seasons Change") Stevie Wonder. Usually, she'snamechecked as a "Norah Jones with soul," which is fair enough sinceher album is intimate, adult, personal and extremely accessible in thebest sense of the word. The 27 year old Rae is still working on herstagecraft -- she has all sorts of cool little hand gestures down pat andwill only improve with time. And that Led Zeppelin cover proved she'sgot a far wider palette to draw from than her debut might indicate. Raecomes back in August for an 18 city tour. Buy her CD and you'll surelywant to see her in concert. Now if only she'd ended her show likeAretha with a plea for us to "Keep Whitney Houston in your prayers,"my pleasure would have been complete.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said..."Since I've Been Loving You" from Led Zep III. Lots of fun but I gottaadmit, gretchen wilson's cover of Black Dog was the one that truly blewme away. Now if only Aretha had sung 'The Battle of Evermore" myweek would have been complete.2:01 PM
