Martin Scorsese Collection*: * * "* 
Warner Bros., $59.92 
A terrific grab bag of five movies by Scorsese, all with new or 
"vintage" documentaries and audio commentary by the voluble 
director. You get his 1968 debut, "Who's nat Knocking At My 
Door?"; the Oscar-winning '~ice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" 
(1974); the prototypical "Mean Streets" (1973); the quirky "After 
Hours" (1986); and his 1990 masterpiece "GoodFellas" (above). 
Duel/The 
Sugarland Express 
*'**1/, 
Universal, $19.98 each 
ANYONE who saw these two 
early releases could have 
picked Steven Spielberg out as 
a major talent. "Duel" is a lean, 
tense 1971 TV movie about a 
traveling salesman who is 
"stalked" by a demonic truck 
driver. "The Sugarland 
Express" (1974) has a winning 
earry tumoy Goldie Hawn -as a 
mom who goes on a multi-state 
chase to keep her son from 
adoption. Extras are minimal. 
Happy Days/ 
Here's Lucy 
**1/2 
Paramount / Shout, $38.99 / 
$34.98 
NOT every TV show needs 
to be immortalized with full 
boxed sets of each season. 
"Happy Days" does because 
smart fans know the first 
season, which makes 
up this set, is a 
modest, sweet little 
affair worth 
watching -as 
compared to the 
cartoon the show 
quickly became. 
The so-so 
sitcom 
"Here's 
Lucy" is 
wisely presented as a best-of Lucille 
Ball package with 24 episodes 
plus audio commentary and 
deleted scenes. 
The Three Musketeers 
** Disney, $29.99 
THIS straight-to-DVD 
feature (the first full-length 
movie to star Mickey, Donald 
and Goofy) has a perfunctory 
spin on the classic 
swashbuckler tale, with the 
three stars hoping to be<;ome 
musketeers. (As opposed to 
Mouseketeers, obviously.) It 
has some postmodern extras, 
with the three cartoon 
characters offering brief audio 
commentary on their 
performance and the director 
and others talking about what it 
was like to work with Mickey. 
Da AliG Show: 
Da Compleet First 
Seuon*** 
HBO,$29.95 
YOU'VE got to love a guy that 
asks moon-walking astronaut 
Buzz Aldrin what it was like to 
land on the sun. Ali G -the 
u.K. hip-hop wannabe, created 
by Sacha Baron C"dhen -
always comes up with one 
improbable, hilarious moment 
in every interview of this goofy 
six-episode HBO series. Extras 
include audio commentary, a 
pitch for a flick called "Spyz 
Movie" and bonus footage. 91
