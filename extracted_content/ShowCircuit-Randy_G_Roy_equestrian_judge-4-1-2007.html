Randy G. Roy shares his insights into judging
with two books. (Quick tip: Stay focused!)
AFTER 35 YEARS of judging at every major horse show in the
United States, Canadian judge Randy G. Roy knows a thing or
two about horse shows. A one-time partner with rider Ian D.
Millar, Roy has published the latest editions of his guides to
judging, You Be The ludge and the more light-hearted Judge's
Pet Peeves. Praised as "invaluable reference" and "hilarious and
serious," the books have become a notable presence at horse
shows. |ust like Roy himself.
"I got abachelor ofarts in French and sociology. I was a
teacher. I worked in a hospital. And then I got into the horse
business with Ian Miller who's on top of the world-he's one
of the best riders in the world right now," recalls Roy about his
entry into judging.
Roy, who turns 60 in lune, says he wanted to give some-
thing back to the horse community. The result is a series of
books, all designed to give people a common sense guide to
the rules of competing and explain exactly what the judges are
looking for. You Be The ludge is filled with photographs and
pointed commentary. ludge s Pet Peeves uses New Yorker-style
cartoons and humor to encourage people to remember the,IANDY c.,vreword by peter G.

â‚¬,SPRING 2()O7basics, like lcaving the ring promptly when the rules call for it.
"I laid out that there are rules to follow," offers Roy, who
has a farm in l(ng City, Ontario with his children. "You need
to follor,r' the lules, not just yolrr own opinion. Follow the
rules and you can do it right."
Some of Roy's rules are: Dress conservatively ("You're there
to present your horse; I don't even want to see you"); don't try
and catch the judge's eyes; don't ride too close to the judge;
and if you're a parent or trainer, it does no good to try and
place yourself in the sightlines of the judge and try and stare
them down or applaud loudly after every jump. This is just
some of the straightforward advice Roy offers after consulting
with many of the top officials who work horse shows.
If readers take away just one piece of wisdom from his
books, Roy hopes that advice would be to focus on the job at
hand and be considerate. Time and again, as a judge Roy sees
competitors caught up in the frills and fripperies that are sec-
ondary to a horse's real goal.
While judges are reluctant to discuss your ride (you should
really be talking to a trainer or taking a class for information),
do not ever ask them about someone else's performance.
"Never, never comment on somebody else's ride," counsels the
iudging guru. "That's the biggest thing."
After 35 years of the highest caliber judging, Roy shows no
sign of slowing down. "Somebody asked me, 'When are you
going to stop judging?' Roy laughs. "My answer was,'When
they stop asking me."' O</p>
