            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  M AY  1 7 ,  2 0 0 6The Da Vinci Code: The Popsurfing ReviewThe Da Vinci Code -- *World PremiereCannes Film FestivalDebussy TheatreI've just seen the godless "Da Vinci Code" and you'd think the Devilwould have made a more entertaining movie. As fellow Cannes-goerMike D'Angelo put it, the book is such a phenomenon that the moviecan't help but be a big hit. Everyone's either read the book or heard of itso everyone will see it. No one will like it -- not the people who read thebook and certainly not the people who haven't read the book. But it willall happen too fast for word of mouth to have any effect. (No wonderthey're opening it on 11,600 screens around the world.)Here are my first notes: Badly done and very silly. People enjoy thenovel because it's silly and a page-turner and they get to pretendthey've learned something...like reading James Michener. ("Did youknow Hawaii...?") But the movie is confusing and flits by so quicklyyou're just lost. They don't even explain what the Fibonacci Sequenceis. (That's the sequence where each number is the product of the twoprevious numbers -- hence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 and so on.)And obviously Ron Howard and Akiva were petrified by the idea ofpeople standing around and talking. Never mind that the book includesa lot of fun talk (wild conspiracy theories, salacious historical tidbits,etc.). Never mind that the book is also a country-spanning adventurewith multiple murders, an albino assassin who self-flagellates himself,guns, poison, narrow escapes and so on. Despite all of that, theypanicked over the thought of Hanks delivering a lecture, so every timehe makes any historical reference, we get a black and white flashback tothat event. If Hanks mentions the Crusades, we get a glimpse of knightslaying seige to castles, with blood flowing and swords flying. If hementions the slaughter of the Templar Knights by the Pope, we see theblade go in. In fact, the movie is filled with unnecessary flashbacks. Didwe really need to see the backstory of the albino assassin? (Mind you,Paul Bettany could bring a lot of new members to Opus Dei.) And I defyanyone who hasn't read the book to explain what the albino'sflashbacks were about.
