on hair Tale"this Boy's Life 
'~ II through my life, I've never been able to complete things," 
says writer/director Raoul O'Connell. That's finally changed 
with A Friend of Dorothy, a short film the 24-year-old O'Con­
nell began shooting while at New York University. It's about a young gay 
man looking for love-and finding it-while browsIng through the Bar­
bra Streisand CDs at the downtown Tower Records. Dorothy, which also 
stars O'Connell, is one of three shorts appearing in the compilation 
Boys Life, which opens at Quad Cinema on December 2. All deal with 
young men coming to terms with their sexual orientation and are sur­
prisingly polished works given the hand-to-mouth circumstances under 
which they were made. More important to O'Connell, they're also free 
of the traditional gay-movie angst. "H you walk 
through life feeling like you have to apologize 
for being gay," he says, "people are going to 
respond to that. H you walk around expressing 
it as something you're perfectly comfortable 
with, then people don't have much ammuni­
tion." What audiences respond to most 
when seeing O'Connell in Dorothy is his win­
some charm. Hollywood has taken notice, 
too. He's already auditioned for a role as a 
boyfriend on Blossom (he didn't get itl; a 
role in Frisk, based on a book by Dennis 
Cooper (he got itl; and a role as a soldier 
in a sci-fi flick (he got that tool. But 
there's a price to be paid for even mod-
est success. "Now 1 have to work out," 
he groans. "I have to get buffed, or at 
least semi-buffed. 1 hate working out­
it's just standing there and saying, 'I 
want my bicep bigger, I want my bicep 
bigger.' And 1 don't want it that much 
bigger." Michael Giltz

outsider. The person who 
dethrones him is Charles Van Doren (Ralph ,) I .. _ I . disagree \
