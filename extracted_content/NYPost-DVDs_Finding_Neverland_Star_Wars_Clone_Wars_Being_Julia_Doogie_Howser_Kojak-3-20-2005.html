Vl Finding Neverland 
Miramax, $29.99 
Finding a good screen version of "Peter Pan" is harder than 
finding Neverland, at least in this weepie about the friendship 
between author James Barrie (Johnny Depp) and a dying 
mother (Kate Winslet) and her children. Not even Depp's 
charming Scottish burr can save the film when director Marc 
Foster refuses to let viewers use their imagination. No, Foster 
insists on showing us Neverland, which immediately looks 
silly instead of enchanting. 
Star Wars Clone 
wars: Volume One 
Fox, $19.98 
If you can't wait for the fmal 
installment of "Star Wars," 
jump into this Cartoon Channel 
animated miniseries. Creator 
Genndy Tartakovsky was given 
free rein by George Lucas to 
tell an action-packed tale that 
takes place between "Attack of 
the Clones" and "Revenge of 
the Sith." More episodes air on 
TV starting March 21. Extras 
include interviews with Lucas 
and Tartakovsky, commen­
taries, storyboards and more. 
Being Julia 
* Sony, $26.96 
How can a movie feature so 
many talented actors - Annette 
Bening, Jeremy Irons, Michael 
Gambon, Miriam Margolyes, 
Juliet Stevenson, Maury 
Chaykin, Rosemary Harris, et al 
-and yet be so poorly acted? 
Bening's Oscar nomination for 
playing a theatrical diva who 
fmds heartbreak in a callow 
(and deadly dull) young lover 
only proves how much actors 
love movies about actors. Extras 
include commentary by Bening 
and Irons. 
Doogie Howser: 
Season One ** Anchor Bay, $39.98 ------
Anyone who has seen Neil Patrick Harris on Broadway in 
"Assassins" or in movies like 
"Harold & Kumar Go To 
White Castle" knows he made 
the transition from child star 
to adult actor. That talent was 
clear from the beginning of 
this silly but sweet 1989 come­
dy about a 16-year-old child 
prodigy turned doctor And 
that electronic diary he kept 
in every episode? A very early 
form of blogging. 
Kojak: Season One 
*** Universal, $39.98 
Telly Savalas deserved his 
Emmy for this 1973 cop drama 
that raised the bar for authen­
ticity and earned praise from 
police departments around 
the country. ("Barney Miller" 
is still the one cops single out 
as the most realistic of all.) 
No extras, but you can spend 
days spotting the talent in 
guest roles. Look for Harvey 
Keitel, John Ritter, James 
Woods, Ann Jillian, Paul 
Michael Glaser and others.</p>
