DEANNA DURBIN -- A HUGE STAR THAT
NEVER QUITE MADE IT
DEANNA DURBIN COLLECTION I  
$49.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber Studio Classics 
By Michael Giltz
What a talent. What a waste. For a brief period in the 1940s, singer and
actress Deanna Durbin was the highest paid actress in the world. Her
first two films were nominated for Best Picture and reportedly saved
Universal from bankruptcy. Her fan club was the biggest in the world.
The Metropolitan Opera came a'calling and offered this lyric soprano
the chance to sing for them. Heck, she made her debut in a short
opposite Judy Garland and soon eclipsed that artist in almost every
way. Almost. 
The truth is Durbin never made a great film, a great album or even
more than a decent single or two. She easily made the leap from
juvenile lead to terrific-looking and talented adult star but to what
purpose? Garland demanded the spotlight; Durbin fled from it. After 21
films at Universal, Durbin walked away from it all, married her third
husband and never did anything creative again. It worked. Her death in
2013 was certainly noted but as more of a curiosity. Durbin became the
answer to a trivia question, one most people would get wrong. Her
movies are rarely watched; her recordings rarely listened to, even by
those who dimly remember her. 
That indifference will probably extend to this odd selection of three
films, as random a choice of movies as one could ask for. Durbin made
21 films for Universal and if you were going to showcase just three,
surely you'd choose the 3 Smart Girls  trilogy: the first was her debut
and a massive success. Or maybe you'd choose her first three. Or the
first three she made with director Henry Koster and producer Joe
Pasternak, the men who snapped her up when MGM passed and
coached Durbin into stardom. Or all six films she made with Koster. Or
something that made a lick of sense. 
Instead, this collection includes the SECOND film in the 3 Smart Girls
trilogy, her SECOND film at Universal ( 100 Men and a Girl ) and her
LAST film with Koster ( It Started With Eve ), which at least has the
distinction of being considered one of Durbin's best. On the bright side,
the three prints on this BluRay collection are solid, the sound quality
good and to continue the random nature of this endeavor, it features
TWO audio commentaries instead of three. You'll also find trailers for
all three films, though weirdly none of them are available on YouTube.
Here's a clip of Durbin singing the Irish traditional "Danny Boy" to
Charles Laughton in It Started With Eve.
All three films are this side of good. They contain strong talent, decent
scripts and enough smarts to make clear everyone was trying. It's easy
to see why they were hits and why no one bothers with them much
anymore. In 3 Smart Girls Grow Up,  Durbin must untangle the
romantic confusion of her two older sisters. The blonde is marrying a
family friend but it's the OTHER sister (a brunette) who really loves
him. To console the loser, Durbin dragoons Robert Cummings into
falling for the brunette, but he too wants the blonde. Hilarity ensues. In
100 Men and A Girl,  Durbin is the daughter of down on his luck
classical musician Adolphe Menjou. They're surrounded by out of work
artists (99 of them, to be exact) so naturally Durbin convinces a
wealthy producer to back her new orchestra and shames conductor
Leopold Stokowski into leading them. It Started With Eve  cranks up
the confusion even more: Cummings (again) is engaged to be married,
which is easy to imagine since he's the son of one of the wealthiest men
in America (Charles Laughton). When dad is dying and wants only to
meet his son's fiancee, Cummings panics when she's not available and
grabs a hat check girl (Durbin) to take the woman's place and let dad's
last moments go quietly. Needless to say, Laughton recovers, Durbin
sees a chance to launch her singing career and despite himself
Cummings falls for this inconvenient gal. 
Each film is painless and breezy, as long as you're in an undemanding
mood. Each features a few moments of real charm and artistry, along
with laugh-out-loud nonsense like only old Hollywood can muster. And
each film shows Durbin was a real, if squandered talent. My favorite
comment on Durbin's career comes from Durbin herself when ending
her career: she was tired of being "the highest-paid star with the
poorest material." Indeed. It's not that these films are awful; they're
just far from what she deserves. 
If Universal was going bankrupt until Durbin rescued her, it might
have been due to construction costs. Even by the standards of
Hollywood, the sets for these three films are bat shit crazy. We're used
to Astaire and Rogers dancing across a massive living room floor in a
sky-high penthouse. Nonetheless, the home of Stokowski in 100 Men
and A Girl is bonkers. He apparently enjoys an atrium in the middle of
his Manhattan home that's so elaborate, an entire 100 piece orchestra
can be arrayed on three levels, with Stokowski popping out of his room
and steps onto an interior balcony to check out the talent as the
orchestra plays. (Indeed, the funniest moment of the film is the
twitching in Stokowski's hands when he simply can't resist the desire to
conduct.) The home of gazillionaire Lauhgton in It Started With Eve is
cozy in comparison, even as Durbin shoves a grand piano from one
cavernous room to another so she can serenade the old buzzard. 
But both are topped by the epic proportions on display in 3 Smart Girls
Grow Up. Their Manhattan home is jaw-dropping in its immensity.
And again, this is in comparison to other insanely lavish Hollywood
movies, not reality. At one point Durbin must storm out of a room and
upstairs in a huff. But the room is so gigantic, the next one so
expansive, the stairs so sweeping that Durbin practically sprints so she
can get to the landing on the next floor and deliver her final zinger.
While she's running,  you could head to the concession stand, get
popcorn and a soda and head back into the theater without missing a
thing. Robert Cummings has the best line in the film. When asked if he
had trouble finding their home Cummings admits he did. He walked by
twice, Cummings says, because he thought their home was the Museum
of Natural History. 
Cummings is a good example of the frustrating nature of Durbin's
vehicles. He breezes in so naturally in 3 Smart Girls Grow Up, it's like a
breath of fresh air. Durbin is surrounded by talent, even if they are
forced to elevate the material rather than getting the script they
deserve. Eugene Pallette is his usual, gravelly voiced charmer as a
wealthy producer confused as to how he suddenly became the not-so-
proud owner of a 100 piece orchestra. Laughton is slumming it in It
Started With Eve,  but he's got marvelous chemistry with Durbin and
his hamminess is held in check. Butlers, waiters, cabbies -- these films
are filled with strong bit players who make the most of their moments.
It Started With Eve in particular is a bummer. It's got the bones of a
good screwball comedy; they just needed to deliver another draft or
two. 
And Durbin is a treat. Director Koster and the scripts do one thing
right: they slip in the classical bits with ease. In 3 Smart Girls Grow
Up, Durbin is allowed to trill away to annoy her two sisters, delivering
the "classy" material with a girl-next-door casualness and a hint of
comedy. Again and again, they incorporate her musical moments
smoothly or give Durbin some comic bit to deliver physically while
singing away. The singing is high class and never mocked, but if they
can have Durbin flirt or joke while delivering a number, they do. 
Durbin is also a charmer as an actor, enjoying the same onscreen
relaxed vibe that turned Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland into all
American kids just when America needed them. And unlike so many
child actors, Durbin grew up very nicely. Look at the scene in It Started
With Eve where Laughton is thought to be dying. Durbin barely has a
word to say, but her face tells it all: sympathy for a dying man, an
immediate chemistry, shame over the trick they're playing on him (well
intentioned though it may be) and above all a sweetness and goodness
that Laughton immediately grasps and which powers the rest of the
film. Best known for her singing, Durbin holds the screen here without
saying a word. 
If you're one of the vanishing few that remembers Durbin, this random
grab bag of movies is presented nicely and with care. If you've never
heard of her,  you won't discover any gems from Hollywood's golden
age. But pay attention and you'll appreciate her talent and wonder what
might have been.
