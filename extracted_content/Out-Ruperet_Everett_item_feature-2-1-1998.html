            <p>Overexposure: Rupert's Not-Sa-Secret Service 
STILL HARD AT WORK on that gay James Bond 
script and donning the role of a world-class mystery 
man in training, Rupert Everett (left) is perfecting 
his many guises. Currently, Everett can be seen on 
stage in London in heavy makeup playing Flora 
Goforth in Tennessee Williams' The Milk Train 
Doesn't Stop Here Anymore. He's also in the current 
issue of Visionaire, in an arty layout shot by Karl Lagerfeld. And most appealing to those who fell 
for him as the romantic-but-sane center of My Best 
Friend's Wedding, Everett is also reportedly adornÂ­
ing the walls of ew York clubs in some of the more 
explicit outtakes from that same Lagerfeld shoot. 
If the nude photos leave little mystery about Everett 
himself, it seems a strange warm-up for a secret 
agent: Where on earth would he hide his gun?</p>
