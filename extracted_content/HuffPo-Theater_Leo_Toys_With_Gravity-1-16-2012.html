 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Leo  Toys With Gravity
LEO  ***
CLURMAN THEATRE ON THEATRE ROW
One of the cleverest dance numbers in film history is
Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling in Royal Wedding .
It's a simple effect, really. They rotated the entire set
slowly so it looks like Astaire is dancing on the walls and
then hanging upside down from the ceiling. As a visual
expression of someone in love, few moments are better.
In a way, this one-man show Leo  let's you watch while a
similar effect is created in front of your eyes. Our hero -- performed by Tobias Wegner, who conceived
the original idea and then created it with Circle Of Eleven -- is in a room. On one side of the stage we seea rectangular screen where a video projection is displayed. On the other side of the stage is a set whereWegner is located. It's a room tilted onto its side. The "floor" in the video projection is actually a wall andwhen Leo looks like he is casually standing on the ground he is in fact performing a feat of gymnastics,holding himself parallel to the ground with one arm while planting his feet halfway up the wall. Thankgoodness you can look at this video to see what I mean.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>You spend the first five minutes giggling with pleasure. But of course your attention would soon wander
if Wegner wasn't a gifted vaudeville act and circus-trained acrobat. Perhaps the subtlest pleasure comes
from the fact that when Wegner is doing something that seems gravity-defying on the video, he's actually
performing something quite simple. And when he looks casual, it's an effect that takes a tremendousamount of effort.Just when Wegner has exhausted the possibilities, the piece ups the ante. First he adds "props" bymaking chalk drawings on the wall, then they add animation by Ingo Panke that can only be seen on thevideo projection and so on. It's a tight, very clever sixty minutes.
As a critic who gets to see shows, it's a delightful way to spend an evening. As a show in a fringe festival,
it must have seemed like manna from heaven. And I don't think the show is stretched out to its one hour
length -- Wegner and director Daniel Briere never flag in their invention. But it is juuuust long enough
for that slot.
On a practical level, I would much prefer for audiences that this piece was kept at say 45 minutes and
combined with one or two other similar acts. If this were shorter and paired with similarly bold and
entertaining works it would make a truly outstanding evening. And properly marketed you could keep theshowcase fresh by replacing one act at a time. On the other hand, my guest enjoyed it much more thanme and has already recommended it. Hopefully adventurous audiences will discover this off-beat gemand enjoy it on its own terms.
Here's that Fred Astaire number if you don't know it.
