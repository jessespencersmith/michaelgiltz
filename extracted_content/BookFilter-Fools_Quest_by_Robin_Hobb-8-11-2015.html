Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis is the middle book in a new trilogy by fantasy author Robin Hobb. While it's part of a much larger world,fantasy fans can start with "Fool's Assassin" and be on solid ground before tackling "Fool's Quest." This one,however, does not stand alone. And if you read the slightly atypical "Fool's Quest," you may be charmed enoughby Hobb to dive into her world and start from the beginning. For her many fans, rest assured that "Fool's Quest"is much more action-packed than the intriguing, slow-building first entry in The Fitz and the Fool trilogy. It hasthe weight of experience -- Fitz is no longer a young man and his skills as a trained assassin have blunted overthe years -- but the excitement of new vistas as well. Superlative fantasy. -- Michael GiltzWhat Others SayPraise for Robin Hobb and Fool’s Assassin“Fantasy as it ought to be written.”—George R. R. Martin“Hobb knows the complicated workings of the wayward human heart, and she takes time to depict them in her tale, totell her story sweetly, insistently, compellingly. . . . A book meant to be inhabited rather than run through.”—TheSeattle Times“[FitzChivalry Farseer is] one of the best characters in fantasy literature.”—Fantasy Book Review“[Hobb’s] prose sparkles, her characters leap off the page.”—Tor.com“Modern fantasy at its irresistible best.”—The Guardian“Fantastic . . . emotionally rich storytelling.”—Library Journal (starred review)What You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
