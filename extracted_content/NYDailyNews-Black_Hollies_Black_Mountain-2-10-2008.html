            <p>New bands look back to the psychedelic era
BY MICHAEL GII';ITZ'
rooves are groovy'. That's the vibe of the bands
that are mining the soul of the psychedelic era for
inspiratioh.
Jersey City denizeirs the Black Hollies are cel-
ebrating their upcoming second CD, "Casting
Shadows," with three shows in three days in the
New York area, starting with Magnetic Field in Brooklyn
on Friday. You'll hear sitars and fuzzy-bass on truly psy-
chedelic numbers like "Paislev Pattern Ground." Thev
joiri groups like Midlake, the boral, Sharon Jones a.td th"
Dap Kings and counfless others who revel in the classic
sounds of classic rock.
Vancouver collective Black Mountain - with their ac-
claimed second album, "In the Rrture" - stomp through
the '70s at the Bowery Ballroom on Feb.22, complete
with a l7-minute epic called."Bright Lights."
And the Welsh band Super Firrry Animals, which plays
the Bowery Ballroom Feb. 25 in support of the new CD
"Hey Venus!," are sure to offer their usual trippy lighG
and-slide show to complement their tunes.
'A lot of newer bands feel like they have to make a
point by sounding different," says Matt Camirind, the
bassist in Back Mountain (and, in the current vogue for
multitasking, the bassist in Blood Meridian as well).
"I malte music that I like listening to and yeah, we like
a lot of older music - country, blues and classic rock.
Music is like a rock'n' roll fantasy. You grew up worship-
ing music and the people who made it. I want to feel the
way it feels to make that music. We're not trying to break
ground. We're just tryingto have fun."
Name-checking bands from 40 years ago makes sense
for a group like the Black Hollies, since that's the music
they've always listened to and loved.
"I ltold my mom responsible," says Black Hollies lead
singerJustinAngelo Morey. "She always had great soul
records and the Beafles and the Yardbirds."
Morey also soaked up classic tunes via the radio.
"As a child growing up in Jersey City, you had to like
rap," says the 3l-year-old. "But I'd listen to the Rhythm
Revue [radio show] every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
onJazz.89.It became routine. I'd be in bed, hanging out,
having brealdast, looking through books and having it
on in the background. Then latel I'd be in a car and go
to thrift stores, like the Salvafion Army on Martin Luther
King in Jersey City. We'd find really amazing '60s gear be-
cause nobody was picking it up and Edwin Starr records
for a dollar."Black Mountain has picked up increasing press at-
tention in the U.K. and "In the Future" will clearly dom-
inate Camirind's life for the next two years. Like so
many groups, it's a shifting collective, with everyone
seemingly involved intwo orthree otherbands. "It's
perfect because I can tourwith these guys until we're
thoroughly sick of each other and then I can switch to
Blood Meridian," jokes Camirind.
Like Camirind (who is a health-care worker when
not touring), Morey has a day job, at the Al Richards
Homemade Chocolates company.But he doesn't do ev-
eryttring old school. The Black Hollies will have a song
featured in the new Dell computer TV ads, following
quickly on an bnline Nike campaign with Lance Arm-
strong and another song being highlighted on the Denis
Leary drama "Rescue Me." True to forrn, however,
Morey doesn't have a DVR and never saw it.
"Unfortunately, I was working the night it came on and
missed it," says Morey. "I have a black-and-white Tvwitfi
the rabbit ears and a dial. I don't even have an iPod." o
