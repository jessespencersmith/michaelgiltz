A young author strikes gold 
with fantasy tales BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
he new fantasy film "Eragon" _ 
the story of a young man who 
bonds with a dragon to fight evil 
-opened as the No.1 movie 
around the world, grossing Some 
$5:1 milLion. (That includes Ihe 
better-than-expected $23 million it 
grossed in the U,S" right behind Will 
Smith" "The Pun;ulr of Happynes s,") 
For Ihe book'. oung auU10r, Christo­
phel' Paolini, it's the latust jaw-droppong 
moment in hjs unlikely career, 
" Jy sister anil [ have been lravel-
ing around I he country," says Paollni, 
who's now 23, "And everyWhere We go 
we're seeing '£ragon' billboards and 
posters and previews on 
lelevision_ There's a fil'e­
breathing dragon bill­
board in L.A.! We don't 
see this stuff in Montana 
because there aren't a 
lot of people in Montana . 
There aren't a lot of bill­
boards because the bison 
don't go to the movies," 
Though he's young, 
Paolini is a fantasy 
veteran. Home-SChooled, 
he was ready for college at 
age 15. But his parents de­
cided Paolini should wait 
until he was older. 
Suddenly, with time 
on his hands, Paolini fa­
mOusly mnpped out a fantasy trilogy 
and began writing, When he was done 
wiU, the lirS! book, rile famUy decided 
10 self-publish i1-and lOur Ihe country 10 
promote the work, fj"sl-seliing aut ilor 
Carl Hiaascn ("Striptease," "Skinny 
Dip," "Natur" Girl") got wind of their 
success, read the book and pushed his 
publisher to snap up the title. The re­
sult? Two best sellers: "Eragon" and its 
sequel, "Eldest," with more than I mil­
lion copies in print -and a third book 
on the way. 
Since Paolini always imagined hIS 
tale as a movie (he was going to write 
a script before it became a novel), see­
mg his story on the big screen with ac­
tors like Jeremy Irons and newcom-
er Edward Speleers as Eragon seems 
amazing. What surprised him most 
about the movie? 
"Just the fact that it was a movie," he 
laughs. "There were times in the film when characters would­
do a line of dialogue 
right out of the book 
and it was a deja YO, 
'Twilight Zone'-sort of moment." 
College has been delayed for now, 
since Paolini has found his calling. 
After he finishes the final book in the 
trilogy, he's bursting with ideas for nov­
els in all sorts of genres, including his­
torical fiction, romance, detective nov­
els, you name it. Since he started at 15, 
Paolini has devoted more than a third of 
his entire life (eight years and counting) 
to the trilogy. 
But alreHtly, ev 'n :-,ollng r authors 
are nipping at his heels. He was d~lighl­
cellO hear thai a girl in the U_IC is pub­
li~l:ung her first fantasy. book at only 13 
yem"S or age. tio as [he grand old mlln 
of youn.g fantasy aUlhors, when is he 
going to I1nish the fjn~ I book? 
"I do want to finish it as soon as pos­
sible," says Paolini. But apparently he's 
been struck by J.K. Rawling syndrome, 
because, he says, he's realized, "It just 
keeps getting bigger'" •</p>
