            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 1 ,  2 0 0 6"New Yorker" Gets Rough With DiamondNot really, actually. But I liked saying "diamond" and "rough" in theheadline. The New Yorker has really improved in the last few yearsunder editor David Remnick. It doesn't feel desperately timely as in theTina Brown years. Like the New Yorker of old, you can pick up an issuethat is months old and not feel you're wasting your time. Still,timeliness is useful when it comes to reviewing movies and books andtheater. And CDs.Oddly, they run a review of Neil Diamond's marvelous new album "12Songs." It came out November 8th ( ages ago when you're talking abouta weekly magazine). The CD made tons of news for being produced byRick Rubin, for being very good and -- unfortunately -- for being one ofthe Sony releases saddled with "security" software that exposedlisteners who wanted to legally rip it to lots of complications. Thealbum started strongly and then collapsed amid all the bad publicity.So it's wonderful the New Yorker is shining a light on his music, butsurely they might have acknowledged somewhere the events of the pastfew months. The article reads as if it were filed in October 2005 andthat ain't a good thing.Other problems: the article wheels out the old canard that NeilDiamond has been dismissed for many years. He's hardly BarryManilow, who was praised and then ignored and then somewhatrehabilitated. Diamond has always been recognized as a terrificsongwriter, one of the last in the Brill Building tradition. He's rarelybeen out of the limelight (even if his new music hasn't made the charts)and barely a year goes by when he isn't profiled by some majorpublication as if they've just "rediscovered" him.Then the reviewer talks about his lyrics being far inferior to hismelodies -- fair enough; everyone else has been saying it for years.Then she quotes a "typically opaque" lyric: "'I am,' I said/ To no onethere/ And no one heard at all/ Not even the chair." That line isn'ttypically opaque -- it's astoundingly opaque, even by Neil Diamondstandards. I'd argue it's one of the most ridiculed, quoted and discussedlyrics in all of pop.
