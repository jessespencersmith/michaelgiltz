UNDER THE RADAR AT THE PUBLIC THEATER 2016:
EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR  *** out of ****
GERMINAL  *** 1/2 out of **** 
PUBLIC THEATER
Why, you may wonder, does New York City become flooded with
festivals devoted to cutting edge theater in the dead of winter? ThankAPAP -- the Association of Performing Arts Presenters. 
They meet in
January each year  and since people looking to book shows are in New
York, what better time to mount your production here and let them see
it in action? Hence the numerous festivals that have sprung up over the
past decade.
The most venerable is Under The Radar,  an umbrella for bold and
unconventional works curated and overseen by the Public Theater. It
runs through January 17 so don't hesitate to snap up any tickets you
can: in most cases, the shows will move on though the artists involvedare often ones you'll be hearing from in years to come. Both shows I'veseen so far were satisfying and classic examples of UTR at its best: the
latest effort from the Obie winning company 600 Highwaymen and my
first exposure to a French duo named Defoort and Goerger I can't waitto see again.
First, the 600 Highwaymen return to UTR with Employee Of The Year.
The story it tells is, perhaps, unremarkable if sad. A little girl is the sole Theater: Under The Radar, Fiddling With 'Fiddler'</p>
<p>survivor of a tragic house fire, only to learn that her parents weren't
"really" her parents, sending her off on a lifelong search for her birth
mother. What makes this story compelling is the way it's told. The castis composed of five young girls in what they adroitly call "a play with
children for adults." Each girl narrates in turn the story of J, this
orphaned child who remains troubled by the abandonment she feels.
It begins with J even before the fire and ends with J as a very old
woman. The girls take center stage one at a time, often incorporating
odd gestures and totemic poses while speaking as J and telling of the
seemingly fruitless search to track down her mom. It becomes sadderand sadder as J can't let go, first running away as a kid and thendragooning her own children into the endless search when she's an
adult. Once in a while, they break into song, plaintive a cappella
numbers that add to the undercurrent of loneliness that existsthroughout.
(This clip is from an earlier mounting.)
Written and directed by Abigail Browde and Michael Slverstone (with
songs by David Cale), Employee Of The Year  works. Why it works, I'm
not quite sure. Perhaps the casting of barely teenage girls emphasizes
the child in us all, especially when we have unresolved issues with our
parents? Maybe it allows us to be more open, more forgiving to acharacter that might have seemed more tiresomely relentless if playedby an adult. (Let it go, we might have felt if J were played by a 30 year
old woman.) But those are just guesses. All I know is that it does  work,
from the conceit of a group of kids trading off this part to the moment
when one actress breaks character and sings as the person she is,
wondering if she'll remember being in this show when she's 60 years
old right down to the oddly sweet ending where they run around stage</p>
<p>giggling and laughing like the kids they are.
Where Employee Of The Year  leaves you pleasingly puzzled (what was
that? you might say to yourself afterwards), Germinal  leaves you just
plain pleased. UTR has been trying to mount this delight for years and
no wonder: it's a bold, clever, crowd-pleaser of a show that is alreadycertain to be among my favorites of 2016. That's a good way to start
off the first week in January.
The video below is a glimpse of an earlier production and slightly
misleading, since the show changes a bit depending on what country
it's mounted in and the language of the audience. Watch it and you'llstill have no idea of what Germinal  is and to explain it is to remove
some of the pleasure of walking into a theater and having no idea whatyou're going to see. But thanks to a rave in the New York Times,chances are you won't be seeing it since the show was an immediatesell-out. The Public tried to squeeze in more added performances but
no such luck. In a better world, this would be a long-running hit Off
Broadway just like Stomp  and Avenue Q  and it's almost cruel to share
details of what will soon be gone.
But here goes! The theater begins in darkness. We see four people
slumped on stage, fiddling with switches that seem to be controlling
the lights of the theater. They begin to "talk" but their silent thoughts
appear as text on the back wall. More fiddling with more controls, thediscovery of a microphone and piece by piece they build a world,"discovering" sound, language (sometimes they're speaking in French,
other times English or deliriously at one point Japanese), translation,
cooperation and more.
Somehow they seem to be creating an entire universe, albeit a nutty</p>
<p>one where everything they can identify (curtains, rubble, the floor and
so on) becomes classified as either "pok pok" (the sound they make
when the microphone taps on it twice) or "not pok pok." But they're
just getting started as these deadpan actors find a guitar and aspeaker and a laptop computer.
Whenever you think they've reached the limit of any particular concept
(like learning how to speak), the story is pushed forward via some new
element. Suddenly they're on the phone with a French operator offeringto sell them a starter pack of life and would they like to add on apackage including the laws of thermodynamics? Or they're going
through the five stages of grief or looking at a chronology of everything
that has happened in the show we're watching...including a glimpse ofwhat's going to happen later.
In the best tradition of Monty Python, it's silly/smart theater,
uproariously funny at times, surprisingly touching at others. The cast is
deadpan perfection and -- as it turns out -- none of them are
professional actors, but artists in other areas who somehow becameinvolved in this project. I would love to see it again, to bring friends, torecommend it to others. But I'll just have to content myself with waiting
eagerly for whatever Halory Goerger and Antoine Defoort do next.
FIDDLER ON THE ROOF  ** 1/2
BROADWAY THEATRE
After brilliant work reviving South Pacific  and The King And I,  director
Bartlett Sher has turned his eye to that iconic warhorse Fiddler On The
Roof.  The first Broadway show to run more than 3000 performances,
Fiddler  was the biggest hit in history and has spawned countless
community and high school productions over the years. It had alsobecome encased in wax, the ghost of Zero Mostel and Topol hoveringover any actor tackling the comic central role of Tevye and the genius
of director-choreographer Jerome Robbins overwhelming anyone
staging the show.
Happily, Sher has tackled the piece with fresh eyes, determined to treat
it not as a nostalgic recreation of a classic but as if it were new.
Unhappily, the big beneficiary of shaking up this treasure of a showwith one of the great scores of all time is probably going to be the nextperson who mounts it. Sher's skill with classics have borne fruit
repeatedly, not just with musicals but also dramas like Joe Turner's
Come And Gone  to Awake And Sing!  For whatever reason, he stumbles
here. Perhaps freeing Fiddler  from its burdening history was
accomplishment enough. And the songs are so strong -- and the cast
here generally solid singers -- that the essential greatness of the work</p>
<p>still shines through.
By casting actor Danny Burstein as Tevye, we get exactly what we
would expect: a more realistic, toned down, human Tevye. That'sclearly the driving impetus of the show, from the modest, real world
framing device (a tourist in Russia is exploring his roots) to the staging
of each and every song. "Tradition," "Matchmaker, Matchmaker," "If IWere A Rich Man" and on and on they come.
But the numbers aren't delivered with show-stopping pizazz, and
intentionally so. The rhythm of these familiar tunes is sped up just anotch, so that they're tossed off with familiar ease, rather than lingering
on the comic lines or "selling" them to the audience. The same is true
of the dialogue and Tevye's bantering chats with Yahweh/God. Thecomedy is quietly underplayed, the Borscht Belt schtick that Mosteland Topol made hay with leavened with a little more salt, the humor left
a little flatter so as not to over-inflate the show, like bread pulled out of
the oven before it has a chance to rise.
Intellectually, this all makes sense. But when you underplay the humor,
you get less humor. When you don't sell the songs, you get less razzledazzle. And unfortunately, there's no corresponding increase in thedrama. Yes, Tevye has five beautiful daughters and his plans with each
and every one of them are foiled by the very thing he treasures the
most: their high spirits and independence that he loves. Yes, thepogroms come ever closer. But the dire world closing in on this smallshtetl seems no more ominous or threatening than usual. "We're Jews;
did you expect a happy ending?" they seem to say as they're forced
out of the only homes they've ever known.
Jessica Hecht is a fine foil as Tevye's wife Golde and though no singer,</p>
<p>she only has to really sing once. Burstein's great talent brings gravitas
to the show's key moment when he rejects the daughter that married
outside the faith and later relents and quietly gives her his blessing. For
a brief moment, we see the more realistic, painful and moving showFiddler  might have been.
But too many factors war with Sher's desire. The set design by Michael
Yeargan is very stylized and frankly underwhelming. Rarely do the
scenes onstage conjured by Sher rise to striking or beautiful effect.And if you're going for a very realistic and human Fiddler , shouldn't
perhaps the sets be more realistic and human too, rather than lessreal?
The supporting cast struggles. Adam Kantor is a good actor but the
bumbling tailor Motel is a tricky part and he hasn't come close yet tofiguring out a way to make Motel not seem to be stepping in from avery different, much lighter show. And the three daughters
underwhelm, especially Melanie Moore as Chava. I should have
recognized this talented dancer from the TV competition So You ThinkYou Can Dance,  which she deservedly won in Season Eight. (Maybe it
was the glasses that kept me from spotting her?) But why she was
cast in a part that's not really a dancer's role I can't say.
Even smaller details seem out of whack. Jesse Kovarsky as the Fiddler
wanders around the set, somehow always seeming out of place and --
to my eye -- "fiddling" out of sync with the actual beautiful music
emanating from the pit. In the chorus, two women doubled up with themen, dancing with them in male garb when not dressed as women,
presumably an economizing gesture to fill the stage. It's a terrible
decision, especially since they don't even keep the women-as-mendiscretely in the background. They constantly seem front and center, a
distraction to say the least and a bad idea since gender separation is
such an issue in this world. (Their dancing is not at issue.) Even worse,they are actually highlighted towards the end in a scene playing twoyoung boys offered up as potential suitors to Tevye's remaining
daughters. In other words, in case you weren't already distracted by
their presence in the chorus, they make sure you spot them anyway.
Burstein's essential skill as an actor and his delight in taking center
stage provides the night's best reason for being. And the songs remain
a pleasure from beginning to end. This is an intelligent if failed tacklingof a great show and far superior in its way to the misbegotten revival
starring Alfred Molina from 2004. When another, greater revival of the
show finally appears a decade from now, we can thank this one forpaving the way.</p>
