This week's DVDs ByMICHAElGllTZ 
Control Room 
*** Lions Gate, $26.98 
A look at al-Jazeera -the 
Arab world's CNN or the 
propaganda arm of al Quaeda, 
depending on your point of 
view. How will it be viewed 10 
years from now? That's the 
sort of question director 
Michael Apted might ask: His 
landmark documentaries -
"The Up Series" (First Run 
Features, $99.95) -revisits a 
group of people every seven 
years from 1964 to the present 
with astonishing results. 
Broadway's Lost 
Treasures II 
*** Acorn, $24.99 
Musical buffs rejoice! "Lost 
Treasures" has Tony 
performances you can't find 
anywhere else. "Broadway: 
The American Musical" (PBS, 
$59.99) is a massive 
documentary with even rarer 
footage. And the "That's 
Entertainment Trilogy" 
(Warner Bros., $49.92) has so 
many clips, you just give in. 
The Casebook of 
Sherlock Holmes *** MPI,$39.98 
Jeremy Brett is the definitive 
Holmes, but the late actor Dawn of the 
Dead 
*** Universal, $29.98 
A zombie movie just 
in time for 
Halloween? Sweet. 
Among the extras: 
how to make 
exploding heads look 
convincing. Also just 
out: 1994's "Ed Wood 
Special Edition" 
(Touchstone, $29.99); 
"The Invisible Man 
Legacy Collection" 
(Universal, $29.98 
with five movies and 
extras; 1983's sapphic 
vampire flick "The 
Hunger" (Warner 
Bros., $19.97) and the 
campy 1979 British 
suspenser "The Cat 
and the Canary" (First 
Run Features, $24.95). 
became increasingly 
mannered as the TV series 
progressed and he grew bored 
with the character. But these 
episodes are fine compared to 
the final batch -"The 
Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes" 
(MPI, $39.98). With Brett 
clearly ill and half the cast 
missing at times, it's a sad end 
to a great show. _ 
The O.C./That 70s 
Show/21 Jump Street ** I!2each 
Warner Bros., $69.98 
Today's TV phenomenon 
often produces tomorrow's 
acclaimed movie star. The 
cops-in-high-school drama "21 
Jump Street" (Anchor Bay, 
$39.98) launched Johnny Depp. 
"That '70s Show" (Fox, $49.98) 
will be best remembered for 
dis-Govering Topher Grac~ 
(please, not Ashton Kutcher), 
Andfrorn "The O.C.?U The _­
obvious pick for stilrdom is 
geeky l:mt lovahle'Adam Brody.</p>
