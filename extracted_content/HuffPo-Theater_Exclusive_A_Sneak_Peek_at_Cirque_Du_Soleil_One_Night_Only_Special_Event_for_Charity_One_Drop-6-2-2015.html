Now they're going to return the favor by sharing water withthe world. The troupe's founder Guy Lalibert√© founded One Drop, an organization dedicated to bringing accessto safe water to everyone in the world, along with raising awareness for the dramatic difference water can makein people's lives.One Night For One Drop is the latest event to raise funds for One Drop. This one night only extravaganza is aunique show featuring artists from across Cirque Du Soleil's many shows. It's filmed and broadcast to cinemasaround the world on June 10. Here's an exclusive look at some of the acts being created and performed for thisspecial event.Think about how easy it is for you to go online, read about this show, buy a ticket with your credit card and thengo see it in a modern, air-conditioned movie theater on June 10. Every step of the way, you're literallysurrounded by faucets and taps and fountains and bottles of water, water everywhere and you never give it athought.Forget movies and special events like One Night For One Drop.
