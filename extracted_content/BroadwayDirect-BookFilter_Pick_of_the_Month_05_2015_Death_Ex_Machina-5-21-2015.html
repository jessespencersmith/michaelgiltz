DEATH EX MACHINA
By Gary Corby
The fifth entry in an amusing, critically acclaimed series set in Ancient Greece, “Death Ex
Machina” takes place around an arts festival celebrating Dionysus. A new play by Sophocles isbeing mounted but rehearsals are marred by a series of accidents that spooked cast membersconsider the work of a ghost. Our proto-detective Nicolaos (called an “inquiry agent”) is put onthe job. He arranges a very public exorcism ritual…which is promptly followed by the mysteriousdeath of an actor. Oops. Now Nico and his wife — the priestess Diotima — must ferret out thereal villain. Australian author Gary Corby is praised for his rare skills: he combines historicaccuracy with a “fair” mystery (that is, readers can work out the solution themselves given theclues) and to top it off, it’s witty! You’ll learn a great deal about ancient Greece and its theater
