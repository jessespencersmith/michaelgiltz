9/03/2005 08:00:00 PMI have not seen this, but reader Aaron (who I know and trust)said he just watched ABC World News This Weekend and theyshowed footage of a black family being rescued from somehighway above the waters and put on a military helicopter. Butbefore the family was allowed inside, everyone was frisked --including a little boy that was maybe ten years old! ABCassured us that military leaders insisted this was necessary.Yes, everyone standing politely by and waiting to be rescuedneeds to be treated like a criminal and frisked. Is there oneexample of someone asking to be rescued who then turned ontheir rescuers? No. Is there anyone who thinks a little 10 yearold boy hungry and crying IS A SECURITY RISK? Who lifts theold people out of their wheelchairs so they can be frisked? Whofrisks the bodies on the side of the road and floating in thewater in case they've been booby-trapped? Who frisks thebabies hungry for milk that might be swaddled in explosives?This is the final humilation for these poor, abandoned people.Tags: Katrina
