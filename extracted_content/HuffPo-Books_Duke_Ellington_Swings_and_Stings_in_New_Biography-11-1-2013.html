            <p>Books:  Duke  Ellington  Swings  and
Stings  in  New  Biography
DUKE:  A  LIFE  OF  DUKE  ELLINGTON
*** out of ****By Terry Teachout  
$30 hardcoverGotham Books
Critic Terry Teachout  has followed his
acclaimed, best-selling biography Pops:  A  Life
Of  Louis  Armstrong  with yet another legendary
figure in jazz: Duke Ellington. Armstronghelped birth jazz; Ellington took it tosophisticated heights.
Often, biographies of artists get me a little
antsy: Shouldn't I just be watching theirmovies, reading their books, studying their artor listening to their music? Isn't that artisticbiography they themselves created -- thereason we're talking about them today -- theimportant stuff? But the best books capturetheir life and creative process, showing you
how they accomplished what they did, why they accomplished it, and shed new light onthe work in the process. So then you scurry back to the art, but with a newfoundappreciation for their craft and a new understanding of why it's so revolutionary.
Duke:  A  Life  Of  Duke  Ellington  certainly accomplishes that. Teachout captures the
breadth of his life from spoiled mama's boy to spoiled genius who arranged everything and
everyone in service to his craft. That's the right of artists and Ellington was
unquestionably an artist of the first order.
With verve and insight, Teachout details Ellington's lucky breaks, from that stint at the
Cotton Club to musicians' strikes that paradoxically helped him out. Naturally Teachout issharp on the music in all its dizzying forms, from classic songs like "Take the 'A' Train" toextended works that fall in and out of favor but have proven enduring.

<p>But Teachout is just as good at highlighting the cultural context: Movies played a vital role
in establishing Ellington as an artist in the eyes of the general public, while elevating theimage of the black man. It was rare indeed for even the best artists not to be demeanedoff-handedly by the media they couldn't control. But Ellington was always elegant, classy,sophisticated and "important" and Teachout is at his best in showing how and why thathappened.
Ellington made a virtue out of necessity: his orchestra would have trouble booking hotels
in the south so they traveled by private train cars. This saved money in some ways,
allowed Ellington his privacy and the luxurious comfort he expected and just as
importantly added to his glamour and prestige. So Jim Crow made him seem classier andakin to the president and other major figures, while the yokels in small towns came out tostare at the train stations.
One detail in particular stuck with me about the racism he faced when forging his path
towards world fame and acceptance as a composer of the first rank. Ellington had a
caricature done by the legendary Al Hirschfeld. That's nice, I thought, a sign of havingmade it, since Hirschfeld did all of the big Broadway stars and other celebs.
But it's the reason Ellington commissioned the elegantlooking sketch that struck me. It was done by his savvy
manager Irving Mills for promotional purposes.
Ellington was world famous by the 1930s but as a matter
of course white newspapers simply refused to runpictures of black people. They would write about histour, do profiles of him and rave about his shows...butthey wouldn't run his picture.
Yes, Ellington had a vivid private life with wives and
mistresses angling for attention from the man whosefirst and last love was himself and his music. But thereal excitement here is the creative process. Ellington
famously wrote "for" his world class musicians, crafting and arranging music specificallyfor them. Figures like the great Johnny Hodges come vividly to life here. Ellington alsogleaned their riffs for material that would become the basis for some of his most famoussongs. Rather than parsing each song for a debate over who deserves how much credit forthis or that gem, Teachout constantly uses songs to illuminate how this riff evolved intothat tune. Each artist in his group gets their due but the inevitable argument arises thatthe musicians who often felt cheated were rarely if ever able to forge out on their own andcreate music of equivalent greatness as composers. Whatever ingredients went into them,the alchemy was often Ellington's and Ellington's alone.
Needless to say, his collaboration with the great Billy Strayhorn is a different matter, with
that gay composer/arranger trading the spotlight in exchange for freedom, though heoften chafed at notn getting his due or feeling taken for granted.
Teachout also debunks Ellington's many post-facto claims for his songs, how this one was
about such-and-such and written in a particular circumstance when in fact it had beeninspired by some riff of one of his musicians and titled something entirely different beforegetting "rebranded." Ellington was also invariably promoting operas and other lengthywork he was just about to finish with the next day.
Teachout argues that if critics hadn't been so dismissive of Ellington's extended works
early on that he might have been more encouraged to pursue symphonic pieces with evenmore vigor and confidence. Still, he turned out quite a few and Teachout arguesconvincingly for some of them, especially the religious-themed works. But it's the</p>
<p>Blanton-Webster years and the dizzying string of classics that came before, during and
after the band's artistic heyday that turn your head: "Cotton Tail," "Chelsea Bridge,"
"Sophisticated Lady," "Satin Doll," "Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me," "Solitude," "EastSt. Louis Toodle-O," "Mood Indigo," "It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing" -- that just scratches the surface and you're already humming one of those gems, aren'tyou? You'll appreciate them more, not to mention seeking out less familiar fare with newexcitement. If you're really lucky, you can play key tracks as they come up in the book. Itextends the reading time, but in the most enjoyable way possible. Ellington and Teachout
would surely approve.
