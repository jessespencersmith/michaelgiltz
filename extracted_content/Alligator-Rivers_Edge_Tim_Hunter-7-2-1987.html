Consider these names: Crispin 
Glover, Keanu Reeves and lone 
Skye Leitch. They're not the usual 
names you see flashi!Jg across a 
mOllie screen. But then River's 
Edge -the film all these people' 
are involved in -is not your 
usual movie. Director Tim Hunter 
is well aware of this .. 
"I have to admit," he said, 
"when I first saw the credits I 
laughed at how unusual so many 
of the names were. It was definite-
1y a bunch of people you weren't 
used to seeing on marquees ." 
But with the critical and com­
, mercia! success of River's Edge, 
se names are popping up more 
and more frequently . The movie 
launching these people is a stark, darkly funny film that -like Blue 
Velvet -. leaves no one un­
moved. 
It is a fresh, realistic portrayal of 
teen-agers so drugged out they are 
desensitized to all but the most 
extreme emotions. River'sEdge, is 
sharp, painful and frequently 
hilarious. 
And it is the type of movie for 
which critics drag out the Big 
Adjectives, adjectives like "con­
trQversial, co.mpelling and shock­
ing." Movie-mavens Siskel and 
Ebert are not alone in naming 
River's Edge "one of the best films 
of the year." . 
The story they are raving about 
is related to a real incident that 
occurred in nOithern lifornta in 
1981. A teen-age boy took his 
girlfriend into the hills and</p>
<p>~u1-.n, ... ' ....... -,.. ... ~._ .~ ____ <~ __ 
strangled her. Later he re~urned to 
scbool and bragged about what 
he'd done. 
When no one believed him, the 
murderer took groups of his clas­
smates into ~he hills to view the 
dead body of their friend. More 
and more people found out about 
the killing, but it wasn't until 
several days later that someone on 
the fringes of the group reporteCl it 
to the authorities . 
But as Tim Hunter explained in 
a telephone interview, that inci-' 
. r 
the imagination of screenwriter 
Neif l'1'r,~~~ 
"Neil only read a contemporary 
news story on tbe murder, some­
thing everyone read," Hunter said. 
"He did not research the crime. He 
took what he had read about it and 
filtered it through some of his own 
experiences and brougbt a lot of 
inspiration to it. So it isn't based in 
allY a'etailed way (on theactul 
event)." 
The end result is something 
, much more satisfying than any 
docu-drama could hope to ~. 
When Samson (Daniel Roebuck) 
·kills his girlfriend , Jamie, tbeir 
buddies seem more confused 
about how they feel than what 
they should do -which is no­
tbing. 
"I cried when that guy died in 
Brian's Song," a girl says glumly 
at one pdint: "You'd figure I'd at 
least be able to cry for someone I 
. hung around with." 
Telling dialogue such as that is 
wbat first attracted Hunter to this 
project. 
"The screenplay was very well­
observed and very dispassionate. 
And yet I had a great· deal of 
feeling for the cbatacters. River's 
Edge is dark, but it has a heart. I 
was (sympatbetic) anyway to­
ward the people in it. Some people 
see these' kids as monsters; my 
feelings toward them are' more 
complex," he said. 
Ironically , Hunter's feelings to­
ward even the idea of doing 
anotber teen-oriented picture 
were . complex. He first came 
to prominence with Tex, which . -
made a star out of Matt Dillon and 
turned Hunter into a hot property, 
He bided his time and finally 
chose Sylvester as his second 
directorial effort. 
A girl-and-her-horse movie, 
Sylvester is notable for being the 
motion-picture debut of Melissa 
Gilbert and little else. "I had' an 
excellent time making Sylvester, I 
really enjoyed it ... although it 
was a disaster commercially, " 
Hunter said. 
Hollywood is only too eager to . -. 
IIJld he s determined not to be 
tagged a teen director, a Itt-John 
Hughes. But when Hunter came 
across the script to River's Edge, 
"It knocked me out ... it felt so 
realistic, and it's a damn good 
story." 
That realism. is tempered by a 
surreal sense of humor. Much of 
that comic relief is provided by 
Feck; a local recluse played by 
Dennis Hopper. He is a burnt-out 
refugee of the '60s who hands out 
Feck-weed (marijuana) to the 
loe!! kids that gravitate around 
him. When alone, Peck dances 
around his house with a blow-up 
sex doll, which refresents the girl 
he murdered many-years ago. 
"I killed a girl once," be says 
proudly. uNo accident. Put a gun 
to the back of her bead and blew 
her brains out the front. I was in 
love." 
"Dennis was great," Hunter 
says. "The kids idolized him. He 
brings so much wonderful history 
with him. He and I were really in 
great agreement about different 
approaches to the part, and we just 
had a really good time working 
together. " 
Another actor Hunter enjoyed 
working with was Crispin Glover , 
who plays Layne, the nominal 
leader of the teen-agers who is 
constantly wired on speed. Glover 
played Marty McFly, Michael J. 
Fox's father in Back To The Fu­
ture. Coming hot on the heels of 
that smash success, Glover's pre­
sence gave River's Edge an extra 
push. IronicraiJY, ~ny .criticism of t e 
-,film has 'ceiltere1:l do· his perfor-'\' 
mance. Wh~lethe rest-o. f.J~~~~ 
are-, -diSatiliift8lY,·: ... ~~ewti Ie, 
Gl,oye~ is h)'~rkine.tic and .. d~~-I 
fraught. In many ways, he embo-! 
dies the-film's balance between the I 
off-beat and the off-putting . 
Hunter spoke up for him: "I was 
very happy to have everybody 
low-key and natural, and Crispin 
off on his own plane. He did see 
the part in comic terms xery spec!.:. 
fically, and he built a very strongly 
t lized . cal or ce." 
Another very stylized momeDt 
:-gi,!es tbe film wbat may very well 
be its most striking sequence . In 
the scene, the killer describes to 
Feck how he killed his girlfriend . 
That vivid monologue is inter­
weaved with shots of two other 
characters making love, and the 
result is a creepy, unnerving pass­
age that few in the audience can 
forget. -
, Often, such highlights of a film 
are udiscovllred" in the cuiting 
room or improvised by the ciirec­
tor, but HUDter spoke up proudly 
for the screenplay. 
He said, "That scene was abso-' 
lutely scripted that way -cut for 
cut. Actually, when Hemdale-{an -_ ..... 
independent film company 
agreed to make River's Edge, they 
were II bit nervous about that 
scene. But I felt it was strong and 
had a classical, timeless feel to 
it." . 
While the film is careful not to 
make moral pronouncements , 
Peck and a radical teacher at the 
local high school -both symbols 
of the '60s -do represent &J-­
conscience of sorts. But Hunter 
does not feel it is making aDy~ 
comparisons between then and 
now. 
" .. don't think River"s·l!dge i~ 
saying, 'Maybe tb~ '60s were 
better,'" he said firmly.t'But"how I 
interpreted the script -which 
had all those linkages between. the 
'60s and the '80s -'was that 
whate~er values people got ex­
cited about in the '6Qs didn't traveJ. 
very well." : •
