GHETTO KLOWN  *** out of ****
LYCEUM THEATRE
If you've ever seen John Leguizamo's  one-man shows,
you probably walked away with one burning question.
Why isn't this talented, sexy, funny, charming, magnetic
guy a bigger star? Or at least on Dancing With The
Stars?  (Every show features a healthy dose of Leguizamo
as a dancing fool.)
He gives the answer in the enjoyable new show, Ghetto
Klown . Previous shows -- Mambo Mouth, Spic-O-Rama,
Freak , and Sexaholic...A Love Story  -- showed us
Leguizamo's childhood, his family and friends, his world.Ghetto Klown  certainly includes plenty of return visits
from his family and friends (and making peace with his father). But it's essentially his creative biography.
We watch Leguizamo goofing around on the streets and getting arrested when he commandeers a subway
train PA system to do a stand-up routine. A wise school-teacher sends him to acting class and before youknow it, Leguizamo is studying under Lee Strasberg.
The heart of the show is Leguizamo's up-and-down love affair with acting as he struggles to turn minor
bit parts into something interesting and maybe graduate from drug dealer to an actual character. He getsall Method-y on the set of Miami Vice , butts heads with Steven Seagal and Kurt Russell on Executive
Decision  and in the funniest moment drives Al Pacino nuts during Carlito's Way.  This clip about the
show has a few choice curse words and is NSFW.

<p>All of Leguizamo's characters are presented with affection, even a best buddy who breaks with him after
30 years of friendship over business. The same is true for the stars Leguizamo skewers. Certainly Seagalwon't be pleased. But when smoking pot with Kurt Russell or getting into a tussle with Patrick Swayze onTo Wong Foo..., Leguizamo invariably takes himself to task more than anyone else and often let's themshare advice he would be smart to take. Sensitive celebrities might take offense, but that would be theirmistake. Fans of Leguizamo will enjoy hearing the latest chapter of his life, especially one that fills in theblanks on his career and doesn't mine the same territory he'd probably exhausted by the time ofSexaholic . Newcomers can get a good introduction, though the show doesn't bite as deeply as his best
work.
So why isn't Leguizamo a bigger star? Lots of reasons. It was hard to get interesting roles as a Latino (he
was always going up against Jimmy Smits, Benecio Del Toro and a handful of others). Leguizamo took along time to learn how to work the system to improve his part without annoying others. He had authorityissues (thanks Dad) that made him butt heads rather than being smart. And he had a lot of growing up todo.
The show ends with Leguizamo in a strong relationship (not to mention with a painfully funny phone sex
anecdote) and a new revelation. His one-man shows always seemed like a refuge, something he would
turn to when he became frustrated with the lack of success in movies or TV. But the light bulb has gone
off for him: with his particular gifts, live theater isn't just an escape, a release from the grind of his "real"career as a movie star. On stage, sharing his life? That's exactly where John Leguizamo  belongs.
