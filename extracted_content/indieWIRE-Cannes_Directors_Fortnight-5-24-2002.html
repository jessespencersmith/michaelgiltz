CANNES 2002: Keeping The Faith At Directors 
Fortnight 
by Michael Giltz 
(indie'NIREJ 05.24.02) -New religions are popping up at the 
55th Cannes Film Festival: the Church of Scientology 
mounted an exhibit to l. Ron Hubbard in a small art store just 
off the Croisette. 
But the old gods still hold sway. As usual, some harrumphed 
that the main competition bowed to old standbys like David 
Cronenberg , Manoel De Oliveira, Allen and Olivier 
Anayaa out of blind faith. (Even if the movies aren't good. al 
least you know what to expect.) 
The Directors Fortnight. Cannes' version of Siamdance , 
was intended to reject the old guard and champion brash new 
talent. But it too takes comfort in the familiar. Hence the 
reappearance of favorites like Catherine Brelilat, Shane 
Meadows, Lisa Cholodenko and Lynne Ramsay. Directors 
Fortnight kept the faith and, some of the time, its prayers were 
answered . 
But not by the sacrilegious Breillat, the French provocateur 
who co-opened the program with "Sex is Comedy ." The other 
co-opener was "Matir Moina" (The Clay Bird), the Fortnight's 
first-ever film from Bangladesh . 
By and large, being asked to open or close any program at 
Cannes is a dubious honor since those films are almost 
always disappointments . But these two split the curse. ~'Matir 
Moina." about the tug between religion and politics in the just­
forming counlly of Bangladesh , got a polite response . "Se~ is 
Comedy," however, was roundly dismissed . It's based on the 
filming of Breillars terrific drama "Fat Girl," a movie 
highlighted by a riveting seduction scene. Anne Pariltaud

stars as a director struggling to capture that moment on film, 
which is complicated by the fact that she's sleeping with The 
AdOf (Gregoire Colin, who is quite naked and deservedly so) 
and that he and The Actress can't stand each other. The 
Actress is Roxane Mesquida who played the same role in 
"Fat Girl" and who admitted in interviews she couldn't stand 
her then co-star, Libero De Rlenzo. It all sounds juicier and 
funnier \han the end result. Apparently Breillat needs to be 
angry to be entertaining. VoIhen she's amused, we're simply 
bored. 
Another highly anticipated film came from director Lisa 
Chotodanko , who scored strongly with her debut feature, 
~Hlgh Art" The follow-up , "Uiurel Canyon," is a far more 
potentially commercial prospect: Christian Bale plays an 
uptight psychiatrist who suddenly finds he and his fiancee 
sharing digs with his free-spirited , pot-smoking , Roek&RoIl 
producing mama (the marvelous Frane .. MeOonn and). 
McOormand is a sneer delight playing, as &eyeral aitics 
pointed out. the very sort of person her protectiYe mom in 
"Almo.t Famous" was deathly afraid would corrupt her son. 
But Cholodenko neyer takes a step we don't anticipate ten 
minutes in adyance. (Okay, except for that threesome 
between mom, her rocII singer boyfriend and her son's mousy 
ftaneae,) Most chalked it up to the sophomore slump and 
confidenUy await her next project. 
Then the faithful were rewarded . Oirector Shane Meadows 
had been championed as a taleflt with his Bob Hoskins 
boxing flick i_ntyFourSevan " and the follow-up , "A Room 
for Romeo Bra ••. • If plOlling you have talent means breaking 
out of the festival circuit towards a wider an house audience 
(and it usually should), then Meadows surely lriu~hed with 
"Once Upon a TIme in the Midland.," a genial charmer 
about a Scottish thief (Robert c..rtyle) who returns ~ to 
claim his woman after a job goes wrong. Ifs an unexpected 
cross between Ken Loach and Sergio Leone, but Meadows 
pulls it off. 
But the highlight of the Fortnight was Lynne Ram.ay·s 
triumph, 'Morvem Callar .~ Ramsay trumps her coolly 
proficient debut, 'Ratcatcher ," and SalT\lnthl Morton's lead 
performBnce is sure to get end-of-the-year attention from the 
critics. Morton plays II young woman wflose boyfriend kills 
himself on Christmas Eve. It proves a marvelous opportunity 
fur the oddball MOI'IIem to rethink her life. Ramsay won't have 
10 rethink hers: !his blackly comic drama is a triumph 
guaranteed to give her cachet and. if she needs them. bigger 
budgets down the road.

Suicide is also the focus of the debut by Mexican director 
Carlos Reygadu . His "Japon" (Japan) has been trimmed 
since its debut in Rotterdam and is the stronger for it. 
Disanningly simple, it follows a middle-aged man who heads 
to a remote village ,where he plans to kill himself. The Man (a 
weathered. appealing Alejandro Ferretisj is directed to the 
bam of a very old peasant named Ascen (Magdalena Flores). 
She senses his despair and reaches out as best she can. 
"Japan" is bold in its design, employing scenes completely 
devoid of sound and a grand climax with a swir1ing shot of 
Reygadas boldly stretching out for minutes. The film also 
features one oHha most awkward sex scenes imaginable. 
(Flores certainly trumps Kathy Bates in "About Schmidt" for 
offering the most unexpected nudity.) 
Also a holdover from another festival, this time Sundance , 
was "Only the Strong Survive," Roger Friedman's labor of 
love about soul singers. Sam Moore. Rufus Thomas and his 
daughter Carla, Wilaon Pickett, Mary Wilson and the rest 
are all in fine voice, as evidenced by the too-brief concert 
footage. This amiable, celebratory dOCt.lmentalY, helmed 
ultimately by Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker , seemed 
right at home in France, which has a long history of 
recognizing the genius of soul singers and jazz musicians long 
before Americans do. Indeed. the afternoon crowd I saw it with 
cheered the film three times: once at the finale. again half.olay 
during the Cl"edits (simply because they hadn't clapped for a 
few minutes, I guess) and then again at the end. 
If MalY Wilson looked well-preserved, her makeup artists had 
nothing on the talents of "L'lmbalaamatore" (The Embalmer ). 
An offbeat Italian romantic drama by Matteo Garrone. its best 
achievement was creating a believable love triangle between a 
gay dwarf embalmer , his very tall and handsome assistant, 
and a beautiful woman. Points taken off for leaving the 
physical aspect of the two men's relationship unnecessarily 
vague; they won us over emotionally but then chickened out. 
Italy was less well-represented with the tired drama "Angela." 
In it, a gangstefs wife falls for her husband's handsome new 
right-hand man. \NIlen the law comes crashing down. she 
refuses to tum state's evidence just to keep her affair a secret. 
Very noble, until you remember she was intimately involved in 
a murderous, drug running gang and profited nicely from it. It's 
based on a true stOIY. but the characters are so colorless you 
find it hard to believe. 
"Mon-Rak Transistor" (A Transistor Love StOlY) from 
Thailand's Pen-ek Ratanaruang was more original. It starts 
out as a witty musical about a poor but cute melon farmer who

loves his girl and wants to be a pop star. The musical 
interludes are cleverly done and the leads (Suppakom 
KibJuwan and Sirlakom Pukkavesa) have charm to spare. 
But the electricity runs low when the movie drops Its light tone 
and all-out musical numbers for a dour middle half where 
everything goes wrong for our hero. (And why does he never. 
ever pick up the phone to call his long-suffering, true love?) It 
rallies towards the end, but the director will have to trust 
whatls special about his projects next time around to truly 
breakout 
Also quite conventional in the end was "Chlh-yen Vee" (Blue 
Gate Crossing). A Taiwanese film about high school students 
in love, it features sexual confusion between a handsome 
swimmer and a pretty girl. The only surprise for anyone who 
knows anything about competitive swimmers is that the sexual 
confusion lies with his girlfriend, who finally admits to a lesbian 
crush on her best pal. Utterly familiar. 
So was "Bord de Mer" (Seaside). Not that this French film 
about a small resort town during several seasons owes a debt 
to any genre in particular. It's just typical of a certain type of 
French film -not much happens and the sooner you accept 
\hat, the quicker you'll be able to enjoy whatever slight charms 
the movie has to offer. Debuting director Julie Lopea-Curval 
could always discover the appeal of a plot in the future; she 
already demonstrates a way with actors. 
Even more familiar to festival-goers was "Le Pays Du Chien 
Qui Chante" (Land of the Singing Dog). A drama about a 
Japanese couple visiting a French village in the mountains , it 
was given a shrug by almost everyone. Director Yann Oedet 
has edited films for the likes of Truffaut and Pialat, but 
unforttJnately his first film is the sort that only e)(ists in the 
hothouse atmosphere of festivals. 
I missed "Abouna" (Our Father). but this drama from Chad 
was about two brothers who go in search of their missing 
father. It gained little attention, but those who saw it had nice 
things to say. 
The closing night film, 'Welcome to Collinwood." starring 
George Clooney, is still to come of course, along with a 
handful of other movies. But for now, I'll remember the best 
two features that pulled together fragments of celluloid. 
"Voir Biba Braviarlum " was called in English "A Bibo 
Reader." i foolishly hoped it was actually "A Bilbo Reader" and 
would contain scenes from Peter Jackson' s upcoming "The

lord of the Ringa: The Two Towers." No such luck, of 
course, But the next best thing happened : this ode to 
Hungarian intellectual Istvan Bibo proved very compelling, It 
pulls together scraps of footage from Hungary -young men 
wrestling, people canoeing, a group exercising and so on -
along with private home movies of Bibo manying and raising 
his family, This is combined with a British voiceover reading 
from Bibo's many published essays. 
I find random footage of people in the past oddly compelling -
it's like glimpsing through a hole in time. But Bibo's insights 
into anti-Semitism were a welcome respite from the general 
tenor of European media. And his comments on how nations 
give up personal freedoms in times of crisis certainly struck a 
nerve as well. One man in the audience quietly snored at the 
early screening (what was he expecting?). But for those who 
think they might care, "A Bibo Reader" will send them out to 
the local bookstore searching for a collection of his woo<. 
Finally, the special midnight screening of ·Poliasona et 
Gellpettes " proves there is nothing new under the sun and 
that anything, given enough time, will be of sober, scholarly 
interest. The film in question was a compilation of hardcore 
pornography from the silent era filmed for screening in 
bordellos . True, no pool boys or pizza deliverymen are 
involved, but everything else was quite familiar, to the 
sophisticated amusement of the largely French audience . 
Naughty nuns, school girls who need a spanking and so on 
were the familiar setups, with surprisingly explicit scenes to 
follow. It was hard to be jaded when one set piece involved a 
bored dog positively dragged into its erotic adventures with 
both women and a rather bold man. Though no directors were 
identified. some pieces were so well lit and shot it was 
believed that major talents were sometimes involved in the 
making of these shorts, most of which were created in the 
1920s. 
The capper was an amusing, animated short that was no less 
bawdy for being a cartoon. It ended with our hero finding 
solace with a very pleased cow. And no, the end credits had 
no disclaimer for the ASPCA.
