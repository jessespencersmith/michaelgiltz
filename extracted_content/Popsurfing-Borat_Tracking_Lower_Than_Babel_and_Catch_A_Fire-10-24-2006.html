            <p>T U E S D AY,  O C TO B E R  2 4 ,  2 0 0 6"Borat" Tracking Lower Than "Babel" and "CatchA Fire?"I cover movies and I BARELY know what "Catch A Fire" is. But studiotracking says that movie and the art house film "Babel" (starring BradPitt) have more "awareness" than "Borat." That just proves how out ofwhack tracking figures have become. Some wonder whether "Borat" isthis season's "Snakes On A Plane." But the comparison is wrong:"Borat" is still a movie most people are going to discover on openingweekend when they see the reviews and hear the raves of their friends."SOAP" was held out of theaters so long that even my MOTHER knewabout the film and got tired of the noise around it. And of course"Snakes" got terrible reviews and "Borat" is getting raves. It will indeedbe one of the hits of the fall and -- thanks to an $18 million budget --very profitable. I can't link to the Variety story about this, because youneed a subscription. Creator Sacha Baron Cohen is already working ona similar film with another character to film next year. But how longcan he stay under the radar and get away with his pranks? "Borat" isgoing to make him more famous than ever.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Interesting. In the story's case, they're [olling specifically about moviesand whether people are familiar with the title and their interest level inseeing it. And given your info,I find it even harder to believe Catch AFire is tracking higher.1:51 PM
