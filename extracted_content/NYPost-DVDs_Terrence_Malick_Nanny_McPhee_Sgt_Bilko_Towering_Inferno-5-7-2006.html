FAR be it from me to
criticize the delightful Ema

wickedly ugly makeup ald a
serious overbite, her Namy

Blme the frmtic direction of
Kirk fones. It all goes dom
easily, thanks to Thompson,
Colin Firth md not-too-cute
child actors Modest extras do
not include comentary from
Thompson, who wote the
screenPlay.
The NewWorld

New Line. $27.98
NO director cm rival
Tenence Malick for the sense
ofwonder he creates
onscreen. It's here in spades.
from the arrival of shios in
America to Pocahontis'
captivating joumey to
England. There's a substantial

these 18 episodes prove thatrrMiArS*H" wasn't the first (or
even perhaps the best)
comedy to use the Army as a

appearances by Silvers with
Ed Sullivm md Dick Cavett.
Emy clips md much more.
The Towering

Special Edition" (Fox, $19.98);
1974's "Etrthquake"
(Universal, $14 98) md
anolher fave flick, 1974's "The

studded fun. Extras ilclude 30
deleted scenes and a new
