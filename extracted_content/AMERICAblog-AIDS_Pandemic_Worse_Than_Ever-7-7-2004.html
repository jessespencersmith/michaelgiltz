AIDS Pandemic Worse Than Ever
by Michael in New York  on 7/07/2004 11:00:00 PM
Here's some cheery news: The UN reports 4.8 million new cases of
HIV worldwide  -- the highest total EVER since HIV was identified in
the early '80s. More than 20 million people have already died and
anywhere from 34 million to 43 million people are HIV positive. Asia
is at a tipping point where numbers could start to explode. And
according to the New York Times, "health workers have less than half
of the $12 billion that is needed for treatment and prevention by the
end of 2005." In other words, a measly $7 billion today could have a
huge impact on saving millions of lives and saving entire countriesfrom disaster. This isn't just a humanitarian good -- it's a pragmatic,reasonable step that would serve our country's economic and
security needs. Meanwhile, Bush continues to politicize world AIDS
funding, isolating and ignoring groups that dare to mentioncondoms, and insisting on name brand drugs when generics couldsave three times as many people for the same cost.
