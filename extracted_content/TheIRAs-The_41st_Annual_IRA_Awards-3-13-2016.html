The 41st Annual IRA Film Awards -- "Tangerine,"
"The Tribe" Triumph
The 41st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2015
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the
best films of the year since 1976. Officially known as the New York
Independent Film Critics Awards but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs, it is
more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial
than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden
Globes, the IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies
released in 2015.
The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained
about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do
better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to
establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is
named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story
lost in the mist of time.) The IRAs has been profiled in  The New
Yorker so it is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever
heard of it . Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have
included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-
selling and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics,
screenwriters, budding playwrights, plain old film buffs and so on. 
This year the IRAs have added Best Nonfiction Film to its list of
awards. 
Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best films of the year.
The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are passionate
film lovers. Many have careers involving the arts but it's not always
easy to stay in the swim of things and keep on top of the flood of new
releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA
members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a
time. The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in
theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) on some streaming
service or DVD if you miss it. Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay
committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their
college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life,
before jobs and family made claims on their time. So if you want to stay
on top of great cinema every year or explore its history, there's no
better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs. 
True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the
year than anyone else. But they've been doing it for decades so, hey, it's
tradition! And the IRA goes to....
BEST PICTURE
1. Tangerine  -- 22 pts.  (out of a possible 45 pts.)
2. Mommy -- 13  pts.
3. (tie)  Mad Max: Fury Road -- 12  pts.
    (tie)  The Tribe 12 pts.
5. Clouds Of Sils Maria 8 pts.
NOTE: When there's a tie, the number of films tied fill up a
corresponding number of slots. Here, two films tied for #3, so that fills
up both #3 and #4. Thus the next film listed is ranked at #5. This year
nine ballots were submitted with a top score for each film of 5 pts, so
the maximum any one film could achieve was 45 pts.
The IRAs are voted on from Best Costumes up to Best Picture. So this
award comes towards the end of the evening. The victory of Tangerine
is no surprise, really: it won or tied for six of the Top 12 awards. (There
are also "negative" awards.) Clearly it's support was deep and strong.
Still, when The Tribe  won the penultimate prize of Best Director by a
substantial margin, it was reasonable to expect it would win Best
Picture. The IRA members are no vehement auteurists, but they
certainly recognize directors as usually the driving force of most films.
Much of the time, Best Picture and Best Director go hand in hand. That
gets muddier when the race is tight, as you can see in years past. What
makes this year rather unusual is that Tangerine  enjoyed a substantial
victory for Best Picture and The Tribe enjoyed a substantial victory for
Best Director. It just proves that IRA voting is informed and smart but
ultimately driven by passion and admiration, not by any hidebound
rules or academic theory. The result? Five films enjoyed five of the top
six awards for the night: The Diary Of A Teenage Girl, The End Of The
Tour, Mommy, Tangerine  and The Tribe. 
BEST DIRECTOR
1. Miroslav Slaboshpytski for The Tribe -- 24 pts.
2. Sean Baker for  Tangerine -- 16 pts.
3. Xavier Dolan for  Mommy -- 12 pts.
4. George Miller for  Mad Max: Fury Road -- 10 pts.
5. Todd Haynes for  Carol -- 9  pts.
NOTE: Coming out of nowhere, The Tribe wins Best Director.
However, while it wasn't a threat to win in earlier categories, The Tribe
did garner mentions in three earlier rounds of voting. Plus, the film's
best shot at an acting award probably came in supporting actress, one
of the most crowded awards in memory, with a wealth of good
performances to choose from. The male characters in the film are
unnamed and tend to blur together. It's not a criticism of the film --
that's how it was crafted. But that does make it harder to single people
out. But this Ukrainian film is one of the boldest movies in memory. It's
set in a school for the deaf and the entire film is performed in
Ukrainian Sign Language, with no dialogue, no subtitles and no voice-
over or even any explanatory text providing context for the film. And
yet, anyone can follow the complex storyline and shifting loyalties of
the characters with relative ease. It's remarkably absorbing and feels
genuinely fresh and new. That doesn't happen every day and this award
is a statement from the IRAs that we'll be hearing from this director
again.
BEST ACTOR
1. Jason Segel for The End Of The Tour  -- 26 pts.
2. Paul Dano for  Love And Mercy -- 17 pts.
3. Antoine-Olivier Pilon for  Mommy -- 16 pts.
4. Ben Mendelsohn for  Mississippi Grind -- 13 pts.
5. Géza Röhrig for  Son Of Saul -- 8 pts.
NOTE: Jason Segel's turn as David Foster Wallace inspired passionate
support from voters. However, Jesse Eisenberg's turn as the reporter in
that film received "Mechanical Actor" points in the final negative
awards of the night, which helps explain why The End Of The Tour
could win Best Actor and Best Screenplay but not really be a player in
many other categories. Ditto Paul Dano and John Cusack for Love And
Mercy.  (By the way, I'm aware it's an ampersand in the official title of
Love And Mercy,  but blogger has a glitch and won't display an
ampersand properly. Someone call Google! Ironically, the song itself IS
styled "Love And Mercy," so there.)
BEST ACTRESS
1. (tie) Anne Dorval for Mommy -- 23 pts.
    (tie) Kitana Kiki Rodriguez for Tangerine -- 23 pts.
3. Ronit Elkabetz for Gett: The Trial Of Viviane Amsalem -- 14 pts.
4. Rooney Mara for Carol -- 12 pts.
5. Bel Powley for  The Diary Of A Teenage Girl -- 11 pts.
NOTE: Here's the big victory for Mommy , a film by previous IRA
winner Xavier Dolan. You can see his new movie was a player in
numerous categories throughout the night, from the first award voted
on (Best Costumes) right up to the top award (Best Picture). Still,
despite our passionate appreciation for Dolan and his work, most
voters weren't able to catch Tom At The Farm,  a 2013 film of his that
finally had a blink-and-you-miss-it commercial run in New York City.
At least IRA members have long memories: Mommy  came out in
January of 2015 but that didn't stop us from honoring it at our
ceremony 14 months later.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
1. Alexander Skarsgård for The Diary Of A Teenage Girl --
18 pts.
2. Michael Keaton for  Spotlight  -- 14 pts.
3. Karren Karagulian for Tangerine -- 9 pts.
4. (tie) Steve Carell for  The Big Short --7 pts.
    (tie) Emory Cohen for Brooklyn -- 7 pts.
    (tie) Michael Fassbender for  Slow West -- 7 pts.
NOTE: This was the only win for The Diary Of A Teenage Girl, one of
the best films of the year (at least according to me). It was admired by
those who saw it but not enough voters did. And here you can see that
getting Oscar attention is no barrier to IRA attention, with Spotlight,
The Big Short  and Brooklyn  all getting some support for various
elements.
                                            
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
Mya Taylor for  Tangerine by acclamation.
1. Mya Taylor for Tangerine -- 26 pts.
2. Suzanne Clément for  Mommy  -- 13 pts.
3. Jennifer Jason Leigh for  The Hateful Eight  -- 9 pts.
4. Elizabeth Banks for Love And Mercy -- 6 pts.
5. (tie) Jane Fonda for Youth -- 5 pts.
    (tie) Greta Gerwig for Mistress America -- 5 pts.
    (tie) Marcia Gay Harden for Grandma -- 5 pts.
NOTE: If a majority of the voters participating in the IRAs each year
(some members vote in absentia via ballot) all nominate the same
person or film in a category, that nominee is the winner by
acclamation. They garnered a majority of support on the first ballot.
We then go through our ballots to see the other honorees, but the
winner is foreordained. As with every category, once a winner is
announced, there is a vote on whether to rescind. Perhaps a core group
liked one performance -- enough to score the most points -- but a
majority hated it. Or perhaps a majority want to see the runner-up win
instead. In cases of a first round winner by acclamation, since a
majority of the people already picked it, a vote to rescind has never
prevailed.
BEST NONFICTION FILM
1. In Jackson Heights -- 20 pts.
2. Amy -- 18 pts.
3. Listen To Me, Marlon -- 15 pts.
4. Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison Of Belief -- 11 pts.
5. Call Me Lucky -- 10 pts.
NOTE: Recent years have seen a flurry of new categories and renaming
of old ones. This year, the IRAs have included the category of "Best
Nonfiction Film." Documentaries and other nonfiction works have
triumphed at the IRAs in years past, notably the PBS civil rights
masterpiece Eyes On The Prize and the art film Decasia  (which
married decaying scraps of old movies to a new score by Michael
Gordon to haunting effect). However, those are the ONLY two
nonfiction films to triumph and these movies have rarely even made a
dent in the Top Five Best Picture race. After much debate and worry
that creating this category meant a nonfiction film would never garner
the top prize again, it has been added. Hopefully, this will encourage
more watching of nonfiction films by members and increase its chances
of being honored in all eligible areas, like editing and director and score
and so on. We shall see.
BEST SCREENPLAY
1. Donald Margulies for The End Of The Tour -- 23  pts.
2. Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for  The Big Short  -- 14 pts.
3. Ronit Elkabetz and Shlomi Elkabetz for Gett: The Trial Of Viviane
Amsalem -- 13 pts.
4. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck for  Mississippi Grind  --11 pts.
5. Xavier Dolan for  Mommy  -- 9 pts.
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
1. Sean Baker and Radium Cheung for Tangerine -- 28 pts.
2. Emmanuel Lubezki for The Revenant -- 15 pts.
3. Valentyn Vasyanovych for The Tribe -- 9  pts.
4. (tie) Mátyás Erdély for  Son Of Saul  -- 8 pts.
    (tie) Edward Lachman for Carol -- 8 pts.
    (tie) Robert Richardson for  The Hateful Eight  -- 8 pts.
    (tie) André Turpin for Mommy -- 8 pts.
NOTE: In a year filled with impressive cinematography, one could
hardly go wrong in naming a well-shot movie. Four films tied for fourth
place and all of them deserved to be singled out, along with others that
didn't make the cut. Technology is such that everything from the "shot
on an iPhone" Tangerine" to the "spare no expense" cutting edge work
on The Revenant  can look great, serve the story and make a film. Still,
the IRA voters are not ones to embrace empty craft: all the films listed
had their adherents, though arguably The Hateful Eight  is the
exception that proved the rule. No one touted it as one of the best films
of the year, but it was still appreciated for both some of the acting and
the old fashioned virtues of shooting on film, not to mention the almost
perverse stunt of choosing an extreme aspect ratio and yet setting most
of the film inside a one room lodge.
BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN
1. (tie)  Judy Becker for Carol -- 18 pts.
    (tie) Colin Gibson for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 18 pts.
3. Mark Digby for  Ex Machina -- 15 pts.
4. Keith P. Cunningham for  Love And Mercy -- 11 pts.
5. Vlad Odudenko for  The Tribe -- 10 pts.
NOTE: Here it was clear that Mad Max: Fury Road  had a lot of
admirers, much as it swept the technical categories at the Academy
Awards. And just like the Oscars, the technical awards are the only
ones that Mad Max: Fury Road  would win. Since we display our
ballots, you can see how close Mad Max: Fury Road  did, garnering a
Top Five placement in Best Picture and Director. When some mocked
voting for Mad Max: Fury Road  by dismissing it as an Oscar winner,
others asked what was so wrong with that? Must the IRAs invariably
avoid movies that win Oscars? Naturally, if the IRAs merely repeated
the same movies that garnered attention from the New York and LA
critics, the Golden Globes and the Oscars, or even the Spirit Awards
and other bodies, it wouldn't have much reason for being. Happily, the
IRAs have a strong independent and international bias that means
there is often very little overlap in the major awards. But there's even
little overlap in the more indie-leaning awards, perhaps due to the
idiosyncratic nature of IRA voters, their willingness to search out truly
obscure movies (usually all the movies appearing on Best Of The Year
list have been vetted by at least some IRA voters) or who knows, a
wealth of good movies in a world where more than 1000 films are
released in New York City each year.
BEST SCORE/MUSIC
1. (tie)  Junkie XL for Mad Max: Fury Road -- 14 pts.
    (tie) Atticus Ross and Brian Wilson for  Love And Mercy -
- 14 pts.
3. Rich Vreeland for It Follows -- 13 pts.
4. (tie) Carter Burwell for Carol -- 11 pts.
    (tie) Jóhann Jóhannsson for  Sicario  --11  pts.
NOTE: It's not official yet, but there's a desire to official rename Best
Music or Best Score to the more appropriate category of "Best Use Of
Music." Did Brian Wilson write a score for the movie Love And Mercy?
No. But his music from Pet Sounds  is ingeniously used in the film to
illuminate the creative process, complete with Paul Dano recording
new vocals and showing songs in various stages of completion. Platoon
made a brilliant use of pre-existing music, as did 2001: A Space
Odyssey.  Love And Mercy  does something different and bolder. Yet
none of it is as easy as you might think. Just slapping some Beethoven
on your images isn't going to win you an IRA or make your movie good.
Rather than worry about what's new and what's pre-existing and which
percentage of which to credit a film for, we have simply been
appreciating the movies that make the best use of music, whatever
their source.
BEST EDITING
1. Sean Baker for Tangerine -- 20 pts.
2. Margaret Sixel for  Mad Max: Fury Road -- 18 pts.
3. (tie) Chris King for  Amy -- 12 pts.
    (tie) Valentyn Vasyanovych for  The Tribe  -- 12 pts.
5. Stevan Riley for  Listen To Me Marlon -- 10 pts.
NOTE: Documentaries often score highly in the editing category
because they typically include a wealth of footage and the movie is
"discovered" in the editing. This year Tangerine triumphed, arguably
because its non-professional cast and loose nature meant this too was a
feature film more than most that found its shape in the editing.
BEST COSTUME
1. Shih-Ching Tsou for Tangerine -- 29 pts.
2. (tie) Sandy Powell for Carol and  Cinderella -- 20 pts.
    (tie) Jenny Beavan for  Mad Max: Fury Road -- 20 pts.
4. Emma Potter for  The End Of The Tour -- 11 pts.
5. (tie) Xavier Dolan for  Mommy  -- 10 pts.
    (tie) Danny Glicker for  Love And Mercy -- 10 pts.
NOTE: Sure, as some noted Tsou was essentially raiding the wardrobes
of the actors in the movie. But she's the one who chose which outfits to
wear so it's still valid. Whether you craft a costume from scratch, alter a
pre-existing one or piece together vintage clothes, you're making
artistic choices every step of the way.
SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep)
1. The Assassin -- 20 pts.
2. The Hateful Eight -- 18 pts.
3. Magic Mike XXL -- 9 pts.
4. Black Mass -- 7  pts.
5. Jurassic World -- 6 pts.
NOTE: Arguably the funniest story of the night revolved around a
screening of The Assassin. That led to a brief torrent of similar tales
about watching a movie with the talent present -- if you know the
director/star/producers are there and the movie is bad, it can be
excruciating. If you don't know they're there, it can be embarrassing.
             
DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick)
1.  Chi-Raq  --  15  pts.
2. Stonewall --  13 pts.
3. The Martian --  12 pts.
4. The Danish Girl  -- 10 pts.
5. Wher e To Invade Next --  8 pts.
NOTE: No one is harder on liberals than liberals. So four of the
ﬁve ﬁlms mentioned here are "progressive" by any standard yet
that won't protect them from brickbats for the worse failing of
making bad art. 
MECHANICAL ACTRESS
1. Eddie Redmayne for  The Danish Girl --  25 pts.
2. Carrie Fisher for  Star W ars: The For ce Awakens --  13 pts.
3. Angelina Jolie Pitt for  By The Sea  -- 8 pts.
4. Meryl Streep for  Ricki And The Flash  and Suffragette -
- 6 pts.
5. (tie) Laura Dern for   99 Homes  --    5 pts.
    (tie) Lily Tomlin for  Grandma  -- 5 pts.
NOTE: The Mechanical awards are for actors relying on
familiar tricks we've seen them personally use time and again
or those tackling a role in a cliched manner . It's a moment for
poisonous comments, getting revenge on movies and talent we
once admired that have let us down or never fooled us in the
ﬁrst place but keep making moves we have to see. This year ,
the IRAs honored the transgender women of Tangerine  but
perhaps undermined that timely nod by cheekily naming Eddie
Redmayne Mechanical Actress for his performance in The
Danish Girl.  Redmayne is of course authentically male (as they
say) and portrays a character who begins as outwardly male but
comes to realize and claim her authentic self as Lily , becoming
one of the ﬁrst people in the world to under go sur gery as part of
her transition to claiming her identity as a woman. (Whew , had
to be careful there!) Some strongly objected (I mean you,
Andy), feeling this was disrespectful to women and transgender
actors and people. While somewhat of a joke, this award also
drove home the belief that in fact Redmayne's performance and
the "tragic" ﬁlm The Danish Girl was in fact inauthentic and
thus this belief was driven home by giving him the award in the
"wrong" category . The fact that Tangerine  triumphed in
numerous categories, including honors for its two main talents,
will hopefully balance out any outrage over this choice.
               
MECHANICAL ACTOR
1. John Cusack for  Chi-Raq and Love And Mercy --  19 pts.
2. Matt Damon for  The Martian  -- 10 pts.
3. Jef f Daniels for  The Martian -- 7 pts.
4. (tie) Jesse Eisenber g for  The End Of The T our -- 5 pts.
    (tie) Tom Hardy for  The Revenant  -- 5 pts.
    (tie) Chris Hemsworth for  Blackhat and In The Heart Of The
Sea -- 5 pts.
    (tie) R yan Reynolds for Woman In Gold  -- 5 pts.
    (tie) Tom Sturridge for  Far Fr om The Madding Cr owd -- 5 pts.
NOTE: So you can spot a groundswell of dislike for The Martian  in the
negative awards. Unlike The Revenant,  the Ridley Scott ﬁlm had no
champions. Similarly , a few really liked John Cusack in the generally admired
Beach Boys movie Love And Mer cy. But a strong contingent -- indeed most of
the voters -- felt he was the central ﬂaw in that movie. Everyone, however ,
agreed his turn in Spike Lee's Chi-Raq  was surreally strange. Unfortunately ,
since a majority of voters included both performances in their vote, the
minority who would have preferred just to single out his work in Chi-Raq  had
to either ignore Cusack entirely or give points to an award that would reﬂect
the will of the voters and mention both movies.
