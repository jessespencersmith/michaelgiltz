BY MICHAEL GILTZ
verything's coming up roses for "Spring Awakening,"
the critically acclaimed Broadway musical that's on its
way to being a genuine from-the-ground-up hit. It is
that hoped-for Holy Grail: a Broadway show that can
cross over to a young, pop/rock audience a la "Rent."
And the young, mostly unknown actors who give it life
are what theater dreams are made of - talented, ener-
getic, and beautiful.

cLiberally adapted from a German play
by Fram Wedekind - written in 189I,
flrst produced in 1906 and controver-
sial for its time - the new "Spring," still
set in the I890s, captues the turbulent
voice ofteenagers grappling with sex
and desire and lust and love in a world
where their parents brely mention the
words. And it does it with a mod-"The othernight, Rosie O'Domell
came to the show," says Gallagher, a na-
tive of Wilmington, Del "She came back-
stage md her first words to me were, 'It's
'Rent" times a thousand.'
"If you'd told me when I was 14 and
blning the 'Rent' soundtrack in my liv-
ing room and pretending to be the chil-
\ acters that I would be starring in
a show that someone would
refer to as going leaps md
bounds bevond that show
that I loved, I would have
thought you were crazy."
For the hmdsome md
engaging Jonathan Groff ,

heart and soul. the smart.
restless Melchior - experi-
encing the groMh of "Spring
Awakening" - first its off-Broadway
incarnation, then onto the Great White
Way and now into a potentia.lly long-M-
ning hit - is a thrill, especially after the
Iancaster, Pa., native's frrst Broadway
show was the notorious flop "In My Life."
"The audiences just keep getting big-
ger and bigger md we keep doing bet-
ter," says Groff, whose first big breakwas playing Rolf in a touring production
of "The Sound of Music "
"During previews, we couldn't sell half
the house- Now that we've opened and
word is getting out and people are com-
in8 back again and telling their friends,
it's spreading. It's really exciting "
Lea Michele, 20 - bom and raised
in Tenafly, N J. - plays the female lead,

he felt so out of place at the auditions, he
initially walked out. He wasn't a Broad-

right around the time that 'The Times
They Are a-Changin' was closing, and
'High Fidelih/ wasn't doing so well," she
says (both shows have since gone dark).
