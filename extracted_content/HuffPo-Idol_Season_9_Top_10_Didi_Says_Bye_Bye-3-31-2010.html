Didi Benami -- who maintained her dignity on
Tuesday when Ryan Seacrest tried to mine her
personal life for TV fodder -- said goodbye on
American Idol  Wednesday. As predicted, the bottom
four was Siobhan Magnus, Katie Stevens, Tim Urban
and Didi Benami.
Siobhan was safe and the rest were in the bottom
three. Then Katie was safe, leaving the ever-smiling
Tim and the ever-tearful Didi, with Didi receiving the
least amount of votes and going home. The judges, of course, didn't use their save, which might have
come into play for Katie and definitely would for Siobhan.
This season was touted as the year for the gals, but the men have proven far more consistent. Three of
the bottom four were women and only the faltering Siobhan could be joining Crystal Bowersox in the top
four. Numerous men are contenders, from Aaron Kelly to Michael Lynche to Casey James to Lee Dewyze.
The show began with a tie-in to Clash Of The Titans , a silly cross-over trailer that paid off when Zeus
(Liam Neeson) said the catch-phrase "Release the Kraken" and they cut to scenes of Simon eviscerating
contestants.
Thankfully, the show mirrored my advice and skipped the horrid lip-sync performances and stuck with
the Ford Focus commercials, this time to the tune of "Kung Fu Fighting" (which is perfect for Tim)! Ihave to admit, the ads have been tolerably amusing this season.
Ruben Studdard was fine with his boilerplate r&b, looking slim and telling Ryan about his upcoming tour
with Clay Aiken. Usher gave a killer performance of his new single...if he were appearing on So You Think
You Can Dance.  While his moves were very good, his singing was so-so (often difficult to do when
delivering an elaborate routine). And I couldn't really follow Sean Combs' performance because my head
was still reeling from the fact that he'd changed his moniker again  from Diddy to Diddy Dirty Money

to hear Combs say that he was nervous appearing on the Idol  stage. Humble isn't exactly his thing so I'll
take him at his word.
Didi was sent home after singing Fleetwood Mac's "Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)" again, which Simon
politely said was far better than her performance the night before. Would it kill the judges to simply say,
"This is the end of the road; congratulations on making the Top 10 and going on the tour" instead of just
awkwardly blurting out that they're not going to save her?
I doubt many people will argue Didi should have been saved. That would only make sense if you believed
she were destined to make the finale and voters had made a tragic mistake. But what about the
contenders? Who do you see in the final four and the finale right now?

My final four preference :
Crystal
LeeCasey Siobhan or Aaron
My final two: Crystal and Lee.
I do love the irony of Usher advising them on their performanc es and then coming out and singling
badly. Additional ly, I actually thought Ruben sang badly as well. This has just been a bad overall
year. And I get that they got attacked for scewing too old in their song styles in previous seasons
by having Neil Diamond days, Barry Manilow days etc... nothing says that you can't have older

whoever you want, but just don't force the kids to sing their songs. Having Miley Cyrus on as a
mentor seems to be a bad idea since she hasn't worked to become good in the same way othershave. She was fed to the public on a TV show. Get somebody who has worked for ages and reallyknows the business as a mentor.
More to the point...he re is my original post. Please e-mail at filmex@cox .net if you feel more
comfortabl e explaining in private what you found so objectiona ble...
These shows are getting more and more painful.
First of all, it was like Seacrest either did a dozen shots before the show, or his Ritalin overloaded . I
don't blame Simon for being uncomforta ble around him, the way he leans in like a perve looking
down a girl's blouse.
In what universe is Ruben "slim"? Maybe he used to be as big as an Airstream, and I just don't
remember, but getting down to Burl Ives shape hardly constitute s a miracle success story. He's a
reminder why Big Mike won't win...the producers won't let it happen. Ruben didn't sell any recordsand neither will Big Mike.
Studdard-U sher-Diddy ...OMG, shoot the audience right now. And me while you're at it.
Will look forward to seeing Didi in the movies, since she seemed to be morphing into Lauren Bacall
the past couple of weeks anyway. Like Katharine McPhee, music will be something she used to getinto acting.
Still Crystal-Ca sey-Siobha n in the final three, believing that Siobhan will get back on track and that
Lee will also get back on track, on the second tier.
That is unkind to say about Ruben. He was indeed obese and has made a significan t effort
to reduce his weight. Anyone who works that hard at improving himself deserves applause
not ridicule.
And Lee "getting back on track" What does that mean? He was the blow out performanc e
of the night.
That is unkind?? My point was I was a fan of Ruben, but to my eyes he did not
look substantia lly different than he did 7 years ago. Am I missing something? He
still looked BIG, not "slim", and really looked the same size as Big Mike (whom Ialso wouldn't call "slim" which his name would attest to), especially in profile. Howis recognizin g that constitute "ridicule" ?
I just thought Ryan getting all giddy and acting like Ruben was the new Jarrod ofSubway was a bit peculiar.
And regarding Lee, unlike Simon, I don't think his life is going to change from that
one performanc e. Crystal-Ca sey-Siobha n are still the ones to beat. My guess is
Lee will revert back to his "There-are -a-million -Eddie Vedder-gro wling-sing ers-out-
there" and rejoin the second tier of the competitio n.
And Lee on his best night has never been as good as Crystal on her worst, notthat she's had one. It's just we all expect less from Lee, so one is surprised whenhe isn't mediocre or boring.

His name should be P. Diddley.
america got it right for not voting for didi. she has a very week voice.
Mamasox! Mamasox! Mamasox! My favorite Idol contestant ever. I can't wait until someone tells Big
Obnoxious to keep his hand off people.
Usher sucked big time.
I think Tim has a great attitude. He KNOWS he's not as good, and he's making sure he has fun
regardless . Isn't that what we should all do? When we can't finish first, we should finish while
having fun and enjoying something we may NEVER see again.And Glitz, you had me fooled for a moment on your opinion of Usher's performanc e. It WAS BAD.
He should have lip-synced . REAL BAD.
Gotcha! on Usher! I agree 100% with you about Tim. I don't understand why the judges actlike a cheery personalit y is some sort of crime. He's on national TV having fun and getting
famous and enjoying himself. Literally millions of people enjoy his singing enough (or justlooking at him) that they get on their phones and vote (some of course because they thinkhe's bad). He absolutely knows he'll be gone in a week or two, so what's the big deal? "PutOn A Happy Face: A Guide To A Successful Life" by Tim Urban. It could happen.
Yeah, I think Tim figures he has nothing to lose so he just keeps smiling. Andsome people just naturally smile or laugh in uncomforta ble situations . He's not
going to argue with them. And I agree, the judges have to give their critiques butwhy make such a big deal out of it when he nervously laughs at himself? They actamazed that "he just doesn't get it." Sure, he gets it. He knows he doesn't havestar singing talent, so why not just hang in as long as you can, keep on smilingand see what happens.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POSTcardiaccare    08:33 PM on 4/01/2010

52 FansWhy are you assuming Siobhan was in the bottom four? They always stage drama and everyone
knew she hadn't done as well last night, so they lined her up with Katie to up the drama. But beforelast night Siobhan had been the one who brought it every week and wowed the crowd and thejudges so I really doubt that she was the fourth lowest. 
Why aren't you saying Andrew was in the bottom four? They also staged the drama with him and
Tim. Nor do I assume Katie necessaril y received more votes than Tim. Again, it's all about the
drama. All we know (or do we?) is that Didi was voted off. 
Tim should have been sent home long ago. I can't imagine how he made the top 24. Oh, but Tim is
so "adorable. " 
It's hard to imagine Katie, Aaron, Andrew, or Tim making the final five. But depending on how wellthey bring it each week from now on, Siobhan, Crystal, Michael, Lee, or Casey could win it. And ofcourse, we'll never know for sure what moves the voters to keep someone going. Lilly and Katelyn,both long gone, for instance, were better than some of those who still remain. 
The drama goes on.
You're quite right: unless Ryan specifical ly says "these two were only separated by only
10,000 votes" or some such comment, we can't assume anything about their ranking. We
only know the bottom three for certain. Tim should have been gone before, but how and
when people leave is somewhat random; we know who we think will be going in the nextfew weeks and they all probably will. The order isn't so important. But there's a lot to besaid about making the Top 4; that's what matters since they get a lot more visibility and abetter shot at a career.And of course making the finals is the real guarantee of doing atleast two or three albums. I'll bet Tim gets an acting gig at the very least.
Probably several of them can have at least a minor career. The ones who havesome personalit y, a reasonably good voice, and good looks. With a good
singing/pe rforming coach and a manager who plays up the American Idol
connection , maybe lands them on some minor TV shows, even regional. 
I don't keep up with the pop music scene much, but I like Idol because of thehuman drama and the individual stories. And I haven't really followed any of the
previous ones who finished low in the top ten. Just like there's thousands of writers
making a good living without ever having a best seller, I'm guessing that there are
tons of singers out there doing okay, making a good living, traveling the circuit,
cutting a few CDs now and then. 
Do you know if any of the lower ten have continued on with much success?
