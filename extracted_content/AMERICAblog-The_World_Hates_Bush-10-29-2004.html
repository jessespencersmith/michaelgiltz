10/29/2004 08:00:00 PMHey, Presidential elections actually ARE a popularity contest, so it'sinteresting to note that if the world were voting, Kerry would win by alandslide. And if you're talking the free world, then it's an even biggerwin. Bush has been rejected by the two groups he claims to careabout the most: the widowed spouses and children of the 9-11victims and the people of Iraq. He's also been rejected by almost allof our traditional allies and the democracies of the world, such asMexico, Canada, France, Germany, the British people, and many,many others.But some people like him -- namely the dictators and thugs of theworld. Islamic terrorists in Spain give him the thumbs up. So doesPakistan, Saudi Arabia, China, Czar Putin of Russia, and Iran. Ifanyone could get into the Orwellian nightmare that is North Korea,we imagine Kim would vote for Bush too."The University of Maryland-based Program on International PolicyAttitudes surveyed 34,000 people in 35 countries from May toAugust. Its finding: In 30 countries, Kerry enjoyed the support of amajority or a plurality; in three countries, respondents liked Bushbetter; and in two they were tied," says the LA Times.
