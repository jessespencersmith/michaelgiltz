I The 1Wilight Zone: 
Season 2 **** Image, $99.99 
TVs greatest anthology series 
has been released on video and 
DVD in numerous different 
combinations, but none can 
match the care of this lavish set 
(and the recently released 
Season 1 at $119.99). You get 
audio commentaries, interviews 
"Twilight Zone" radio plays, ' 
promos, Rod Serling's 
appearances on talk shows and 
more. And, of course, classic 
episodes such as "Eye of the 
Beholder" and "Nick ofTinle," 
in gorgeous transfers. Essential. =usha Criterion, $39.95 
As George Lucas winds up his 
.. tar War "saga (and endures 
l.)Hckbats for the films' fading 
appeal), he can take great 
c mfort in one act of kindness: 
he and Francis Ford Coppola 
reigruted the career of director 
Akira Kurosawa by backing this 
bclllia.nt 1980 epic. Extras 
in fide -of all things -
S ory whiskey commercials 
sh t on the fIlm's set. 
British war Collection * *lh ArichQr Bay, $89.98 
These discs may constitute 
the d of the year -five 
littie-known but generally 
terrific British war films, in a While it's no secret 
where the sympathies 
of the great director 
Mike Leigh lie on the 
abortion issue, it's a 
credit to the artists . 
involved that "Vera 
Drake" is far from a 
polemic about 
abortion. Imelda 
Staunton's incredible 
performance as Vera -
a sweet little old lady 
in '50s England who 
helps women 
terminate pregnancies 
-is too good to limit 
this to an "issues" 
movie. No extras; this 
spare, memorable fIlm 
speaks for itself. 
fine new boxed set. No extras, 
but fine transfers of 1955's 
"Colditz Story" (a nifty prisonÂ­
break movie), 1953's tense 
U-boat drama "The Cruel Sea" 
and three more. Film buffs 
should jump. 
Apollo 13: 10th 
Anniversary Edition ***Ya Universal, $22.98 -'------
Ron Howard's best movie is 
still this matter-of-fact but 
gripping look at the space 
program in its most griping 
and courageous hour. The 
1995 movie about a mission 
gone awry is still a textbook 
example of no-fuss 
filmmaking. New extras for 
this edition include two new 
documentaries -"Lucky 13: 
The Astronauts' Story" .and 
"Conquering Space: The 
Moon and Beyond" -totaling 
about an hour in length.</p>
