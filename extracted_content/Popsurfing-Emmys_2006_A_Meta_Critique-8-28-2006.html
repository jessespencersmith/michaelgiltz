            <p>M O N D AY,  A U G U S T  2 8 ,  2 0 0 6The Emmys -- A Meta CritiqueTwo of the LA Times writers blast the Emmy awards for various andsundry reasons, most of them reasonable. Then Tom O'Neil of the LATimes awards section The Envelope takes their complaints on one at atime. And now I take on O'Neil. Very meta. Somewhere, the corpse ofDerrida is smiling.Like The Oscars, the Emmy Awards does a terrible job of showcasingthe very art it means to celebrate. The Oscars rarely show movie clipsand the ones they do show are often poorly chosen and too short. Lastnight, the Emmys haphazardly showed some clips from some showsearly on and then dropped it almost completely as the night progressedand the clock ticked. Even the top sitcoms and dramas weren'tshowcased. In other words, TV viewers watched three hours of TVcelebrating TV and I don't think anyone saw a single clip of a singleshow that would make them say, Wow, I want to watch that.This is a much bigger issue than who wins and who loses. On theGrammys, the biggest long-term winner is not the person who takeshome an award but often the artist who gets to perform and knocksthem dead. On the Emmys, the big winner could be a show like "RescueMe" or even "Law & Order: SVU" -- what if they showed a meaty clipthat exposed those series to people who have never watched them andmade those viewers say, Gee, that looks really interesting? Maybe agreat clip from "Grey's Anatomy" (say the overheated episode with theunexploded bomb) could have made some men think, Hey, that doesn'tlook so much like a chick flick as I thought. How about a substantialclip from "The Amazing Race" that might actually explain why thisseries wins year after year after year. I think I saw 15 seconds from"The Office," which ain't enough to make those who haven't come onboard eagerly set their Tivos for the new season. If it's the best comedyof the year, surely they can spare one minute to show some hilariousscene that works out of context, something to make people say, Let'swatch that when it comes back in a few weeks.REBUTTAL OF O'NEIL'S REBUTTAL #1 -- O'Neil says in fact that theright shows often win -- sure, "Grey's Anatomy" lost but it lost to "24."Sure, "Lost" wasn't even nominated but it submitted the wrongNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
