            <p>Q&AI------
Scott Pomfret 
& Scott Whittier 
The two Scotts-lawyer Pomfret and adver­
tising whiz Whittier-have broken into the 
book industry big time with the romance 
novel Hot Sauce (Warner Books, $12.95). 
After self-publishing four books and setting 
up a Web site to promote them, the Boston­
based couple saw their mix of traditional 
romance and gay elements catch the eye of 
major imprints. Now they're garnering more 
press and more readers than ever. 
What's the difference between gay erotica (which you both write on 
your own) and a gay romance novel? 
Whittier: It's the focus on the relationship. 
Pomfret: In erotica you have a lot of the allure of the stranger. You 
get a lot ofthe dark alley, and the romance lasts all of 15 seconds 
before the action starts. 
The college freshman moving into the dorm ... 
Pomfret: You've got it. One step into the dorm room, and he's 
already getting laid. In one of our books the first sex scene is on 
page 3. But it's always in the context of relationships. I'd like to 
think it's at least as hot, but it's much more focused on tenderness 
and "I know what this guy likes" and loving gestures. 
Which is harder to write? 
Whittier: 1 love writing the romances because sex isn't the only 
part of it. Erotica is like a quickie; you just knock out a quick, hot 
little story. 
Pomfret: If we've just had sex, both erotica and romance are 
impossible to write because there's no motivation to get worked 
up again. But I think tenderness is a little harder to write. You've 
got to stay focused on your characters, so one sex scene can't be so 
different from another that it seems like different people. 
Who writes better sex scenes? 
Whittier: My scenes for the romance novel are sweet. The ones 1 
write for erotic anthologies are ... filthy. [Laughs] 
Pomfret: I've got to say, on the erotic writing, Scott has a dirtier 
imagination than I do. I find it totally attractive, personally. 
Is monogamy p~rt and parcel ofthe romance genre? 
Pomfret: Monogamy is what we're shooting for right now. It 
doesn't mean there won't be a different type of romance novel 
in the future. We're not trying to write for everyone. We're 
writing for people who have that dream of a husband, Mr. 
Right. And that is a dream of monogamy. " In our books 
the sex is 
perfect, and 
it goes on 
for five 
pages, and 
you don't 
break your 
parents' hot 
tub, which 
I've done. 
" 
8 I August 16. 2005 www.advocate.com And of course all your characters are absurdly 
handsome and successful and sexy. 
Whittier: I will admit, the only negative 
feedback we've gotten from people is that 
the heroes are too handsome, too hot. It is 
fantasy. The sex is always wonderful, and it 
goes on for five pages, and it's perfect. And 
you don't break your parents' hot tub, 
which I've done. 
What's the most romantic thing about the 
other Scott? 
Whittier: He makes me coffee every morn­
ing. 1 don't get out of bed until 1 hear the 
grinder going. 
Perhaps the most romantic fact about Hot 
Sauce is that it had to be rewritten. Your 
original, self-published version climaxed with 
a gay civil union in Vermont-but when 
Warner Books was relaunching it, you had to 
update it to a same-sex marriage in Massa­
chusetts, where the story is set. 
Pomfret: Honestly, that almost made me 
weep, to be able to rewrite that scene and to 
set it in our own state, with history getting 
ahead of what we are doing. It was fantas­
tic. An honor, really.
