8/18/2004 12:40:00 PMThe New York Times reports that the rebel cleric Al-Sadr has acceptedtruce terms of the interim Iraqi government -- namely to leave theholy shrine and, perhaps, to convert his militia into a politicalorganization. The bad news is that every time Al-Sadr resorts toviolence and makes cynical use of holy shrines he grows in popularity,so he might very well do so again. But dealing with the interimgovernment by negotiating and accepting their terms gives it thecredibility it so desperately needs. Al-Sadr can't keep working withthe Iraqi leaders and then pretend they're illegitimate. That's onegood sign for long term stability as the January elections grow closer.
