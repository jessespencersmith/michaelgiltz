8/05/2004 09:35:00 AMYou'd have to be a fool not to realize Bruce Springsteen has been aliberal. But while he's never hesitated to speak his mind, Springsteenhas avoided partisan politics or political endorsements. Until now. Inthe NYT today, he has a thoughtful essay that explains why heendorses John Kerry. Admired by millions, he might very well speakto the heartland and some of those undecideds. Given his principledcareer, links to causes like veterans and local food banks, and thatsearing tribute to 9/11 "My City in Ruins," this means a lot more thanthe usual celebrity endorsement. And if Kerry wins, it'll mean one hellof an inaugural ball.
