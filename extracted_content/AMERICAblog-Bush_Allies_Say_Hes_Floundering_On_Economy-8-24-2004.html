8/24/2004 02:33:00 AMMore divisions on the right, as Republican business leaders andothers say the Bush team is adrift on the economy and has no newideas to offer beyond "four more years." Make sure you read throughthe Washington Post article. Halfway in, there's a fun section whereTreasury Secretary John W. Snow shows an Orwellian gift for staringfacts in the face and blithely stating the obvious -- what mygranddaddy used to call "lying". Some examples:"In May, when the unemployment rate of 20- to 24-year-olds hadrisen to 9.7 percent, from 9.2 percent the month before, he toldgraduates at Kenyon College in Ohio, 'The job market is ripe for youright now.'"On Thursday, Snow told employees of a ventilation company inSpringfield, Mo., 'The tax cuts . . . are a critical part of the reasonwhy I am able to report that our national economy has found itsfooting.' Meanwhile, in New York, the Conference Board, a businessresearch firm, reported a second straight monthly decline in its indexof leading economic indicators. 'The latest decline in the leading indexreflects a loss of forward momentum,' said Conference Boardeconomist Ken Goldstein, citing 'worries about where economicgrowth will come from now that tax refunds have been spent.'"Snow's doublespeak is impressive, no?
