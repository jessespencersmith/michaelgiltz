            <p>T H U R S D AY,  A U G U S T  2 4 ,  2 0 0 6Bush Has Read 60 Books So Far This Year?Shouldn't he be a little busy running the country? As if it's not badenough they expect us to believe Bush is dipping into Camus' "TheStranger" and other weighty tomes, the White House now wants us toswallow the story that Bush and Karl Rove are having a book-readingcontest and that Bush has read 60 books so far this year, compared toRove's 50. Richboy pointed out this article to me and asked where I'mat in reading this year. I am an avid book reader and I'm certainly notnear 60 books yet. (Of course, I spend two or three hours a day readingnewspapers and news websites -- something Bush doesn't bother with.)But look at the recent books on Bush's nightstand: "Mao: TheUnknown Story," "Lincoln: A Life Of Purpose and Power," "Polio: AnAmerican Story" and other weighty tomes. Two baseball books lightenthe load a little. Almost all of them are 400+ page serious reads. Justfor fun, I added up the length of the 12 books mentioned: it comes to5,426 pages! That is a LOT of reading for anyone, much less a Presidentwith two countries to occupy and a Middle East meltdown.Here are the books I've read since February (at least the ones I wrotedown in my Palm Pilot)1. Stowaway by Karen Hesse *** (hey, kids books are the only way I'llkeep pace with Bushie)2. The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi ***3. Children of the New Forest by Frederick Maryat ** 1/24. Writing Home by Alan Bennett *** 1/25. Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen *** 1/26. The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane by Kate DiCamillo ***7. I Say A Little Prayer by E. Lynn Harris *8. What Becomes of the Broken-hearted by E. Lynn Harris ** 1/29. Dead Until Dark by Charlaine Harris ** 1/210. Living Dead in Dallas by Charlaine Harris ** 1/211. His Majesty's Dragon by Naomi Novik ** 1/212. Billy by Pamela Stephenson ** 1/213. Two Weeks in the Midday Sun by Roger Ebert *** 1/214. Shakespeare's Landlord by Charlaine Harris **15.
