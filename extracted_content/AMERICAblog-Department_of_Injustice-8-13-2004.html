8/13/2004 01:51:00 AMI wish John Ashcroft would get his act together or at least be a littleconsistent.In Germany, he was withholding evidence from a trial and forcing thatcase to collapse and the govt. to let possible terrorists go free. (TheUS has finally relented.)Here at home, his people have been withholding evidence so theycould win a trial and claim a terrorist cell had been defeated. [Go tobottom of link for story.]That's just too confusing. Please either withhold evidence to win atrial or lose a trial; doing both just gives me a headache.Thanks to a witness who says that a "surveillance video" was actually"sightseeing pictures taken on a student trip," not to mention all thatwithheld evidence the Justice Dept. admitted to, this blow against AlQuaeda looks shaky. But hey, even if it turns out to be an unfair trial,that's gotta be better than no trial at all, right J.A.? So what are theymoaning about?
