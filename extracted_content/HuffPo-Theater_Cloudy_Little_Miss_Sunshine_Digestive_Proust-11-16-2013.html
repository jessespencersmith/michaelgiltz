LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE  **
2ECOND STAGE THEATRE
A curious project falls flat. Sometimes, you hear about a book or movie being turned
into a musical and think, of course! Other times you think, really? That was certainlymy reaction to the announcement that the team behind The 25th Annual PutnamCounty Spelling Bee  was tackling the amiable but over-praised Oscar-winning hit
comedy Little Miss Sunshine  into a musical. Most of the story takes place in a vehicle,
most of the characters are dour and you just didn't watch the movie and say toyourself, if only Alan Arkin would burst into song! Of course, anything is possible andanyone who attends the theater regularly knows that some shows that seem perfectfor musicalization fall flat while others work like a gem.
Sadly, that's not the case here with songs and a score by William Finn that's so
generally tuneless you would think the stage was filled with newbies instead of Tony-
nominated talent. The book by director James Lapine is no better. Everyone involved
has done and will do better work.
The story is a sad one: a middle class family (barely) is falling apart even as it gets
larger. Uncle Frank (Rory O'Malley) has shown up looking for shelter -- he's thecountry's foremost Proust scholar but losing his boyfriend to an academic rival droveFrank to a suicide attempt. Mom (Stephanie J. Block) is shouldering the burden of thebills because her husband Richard (Will Swenson) is out of work and has all hishopes pinned on selling a self-help book. Grumpy grandpa (David Rasche) likes tosmoke pot and speak the truth. Teenager Dwayne (Logan Rowland) is refusing tospeak until he can enlist in the military flight school of his choice.
Only perky little Olive (a winning Hannah Nordberg) keeps a sunny disposition. By a
fluke, she's qualified for a regional beauty pageant and the little kid squeals withdelight so winningly that before you know it everyone has piled into a broken down oldVW bus to get her to the big event. Hijinks ensue.
An amusingly sarcastic opener (in which the song says the question is not if you'll failMay 15, 2014

<p>but when) proves about the only bright spot in a show where the cast frantically
rearranges chairs on stage to suggest traveling cross country in a vehicle and rather
unconvincingly bursts into song every once in a while. Sheryl and Richard are alwaysfighting so we get a flashback to their first romance...and they're fighting there as well!Truly, the book struggles to deepen these characters who were never more than anexcuse for comic one-liners to begin with.
It climaxes with a desperate attempt to mimic the movie's feel-good finale but the
original song by Finn can't compete with the impact of a little girl dancing to "Super
Freak Part 1" by Rick James even if it were good, which it isn't. Since the characters
never establish themselves, the actors all feel like pale imitations of the film's cast,which does no one any favors, especially with Rasche, who has to growl his way
through lines much funnier when they were growled first by Arkin.
On the bright side, the two kids acquit themselves well. Rowland has the big shoes of
the talented Paul Dano to fill but manages to chart his own path. And Nordberg really
is cute as Olive, avoiding all the cliches of an adorable tyke and creating a genuinelittle girl. One clever idea has her taunted by a group of bitchy little girls but thisconceit disappears fast -- even though their brief moments are the funniest in theshow. In multiple small parts, Jennifer Sanchez, Wesley Taylor and Josh Lamon allmanage to score some amusing turns, though one funny song at the beauty pageantwas more than enough. (The second jokey tune by Miss California was pointless.)The scenic and projection design by Beowulf Boritt was succinct (a map stretchedfrom the floor to the ceiling and out over the audience) while the costumes by JenniferCaprio were fun but not too silly (except when they should be).
The lead actors were let down by the material, with Swenson sounding flat and
uncomfortable in his songs while Block in a thankless role had one decent tune todeliver. The film Little Miss Sunshine  was a happy accident. This attempt at a stage
musical with such major talent on board is a sad one.
SOUVENIR  ** 1/2
ABRONS ARTS CENTEROddly, the brother in Little Miss Sunshine  is America's foremost Proust scholar. Now
here's a one-man show from Ireland that uses Proust's landmark work as a
springboard for a new theatrical piece that riffs on that Everest of reading whileincorporating a Springsteen song on a harmonium, two goldfish, audienceparticipation and View-Master. It felt like a fringe offering and indeed after seeing theshow I looked it up and discovered it was indeed, the sort of pleasant show you mightstumble upon at a fringe festival (as at any festival, most offerings are not very good)and make a mental note to keep an eye out for the company's next work.
In this case, that first effort by Dead Centre has made it to New York. Good for them,
though Souvenir  -- written and performed by Bush Moukarzel and directed by Ben
Kidd -- would have been better served being slotted in one of our fringe fests ratherthan a stand-alone run. It can boast of ambition and some modest clever touches butdoesn't hold up to the spotlight as a fully formed work.
It begins evocatively enough with some winning pop music and a bemused Moukarzel
standing in front of an audience planning to read from Proust but finding the pages
are falling out of his copies. Soon, loose paper is fluttering down from the rafters after
he tosses them up, music is swelling and the show is off to a strong start.</p>
<p>It's a one hour riff on the landmark work Remembrance Of Things Past  (or if you want
to be a stickler for the less evocative but more accurate translation of the title, In
Search Of Lost Time ). Funnily enough, I saw the show on November 14, the 100th
anniversary of the publication of Swann's Way,  volume one of his magnum opus
which runs thousands of pages. I've read them all while my guest had never read aword; unfortunately, whichever way you approach the show as a reader in terms ofProust, it is admirable but not engaging emotionally.
Souvenir  is strongest when it's least tied to Proust. A memory of Proust at the theater
slides into a memory of Moukarzel attending a performance of Proust. Proust's jealous
love of Albertine is evoked when Moukarzel plays Springsteen's "I'm On Fire" on a
handy harmonium. An attempt to create a public/private moment leads to the handing
out of View-Masters so the entire audience can quietly contemplate several images
both together and alone.
Certain touches work well, such as a darkened room with the actor spotlighted by one
bulb while sporting glasses in the shape of a bicycle or the finale where sand
cascades down from the ceiling like the sands of time, of course. One bit of audience
participation works fine; but when it's followed by another bit of audience participation,
it feels forced given the short length of the show. Too much time is spent charting theplotlines of the book, from the famous opening (an inevitable inclusion) to Albertine,Albertine, Albertine and more Albertine. Each passage is fine in and of itself, but thecumulative effect is counterproductive: all you get is a mere outline of the story youaren't being told when Souvenir  is best at offering up Moukarzel's story of reading the
books and how they seeped into his life.
The View-Masters are typical: it's a fresh gesture (and getting enough of them for an
audience of 50 was probably the biggest expense of the show). But then we're offeredabout five or six images and three of them are jokes about trying to get us toremember how great the show was (such as pretending Springsteen made a guestappearance or flashing forward to a rave review). And the remaining, repetitive
images don't amount to much when we're hungering for some memorable final
flourish to take away with us. Instead, all we get is the same image of Proust twice,
though the second time it includes -- I think -- the dates 1871 (his birth) to 2013.
Meaning Proust died this year? That his work still lives? (Then why the end date?)Meaning what, exactly?
Moukarzel had a quiet confidence at the start but as the show began to squeeze in
more and more of Proust and less and less of their impressions of Proust, his deliverybegan to feel rushed and awkward. I enjoyed his humor, the gobbling of madeleinesthat would lead to him collapsing under the weight of memories, the blurring of actorand author and so on. Perhaps if it's confident enough to be more off center down theroad, Dead Centre will prove worth keeping an eye on.
