6/11/2005 11:30:00 AMThe Group of 8 major industrialized countries have agreed tocancel debt for 18 of the world's poorest countries -- at a totalof $40 billion -- with more than 20 other countries likelyeligible if they can beat down corruption and prove the moneywon't be wasted. The more governments involved, the harder itwill be for the US to weasel out or change the rules midstreamas it did with the flase promise to fight AIDS with $15 billion inmoney. (Actually, what Bush did there was HURT the fightagainst AIDS by defunding groups that were already in placeand making progress, politicize the money being sent, simplydrag its feet on sending money, etc.) Now we have to makesure Bush keeps his word.Some major points:The money won't be wasted -- Any time you try to feedstarving children in Africa, Bush and the far right insist themoney will be wasted by corrupt governments and militarydictatorships. (They never make this argument when sendingaid to the corrupt government of Saudi Arabia or the militarydictatorship of Pakistan, of course.) Now Bush hasacknowledged that there are dozens of countries that meet HISstandards for responsible governance. Plus, there are manyforms of aid (like funding vaccination programs) that can beadministered by international groups rather than localgovernments.Bush wasn't able to play games -- This is real debt relief,though Bush's empty proposal was initially to take moneyalready targeted for aid and simply divert it to debt relief. (Inother words, if you were sending $1 billion in aid, instead offeeding the hungry, you'd pay off debt and leave thegovernment to catch the shortfall, making it a zero sum game.)Bush will be WASTING OUR MONEY if he doesn't followthrough on the rest of Blair's plan -- This is an importantdeal, but it will be an empty gesture if we don't tackle Africa onevery level by doubling aid and lowering trade barriers. If youpay off someone's credit card but refuse to let them get a job,they'll just sink right back into crippling debt.
