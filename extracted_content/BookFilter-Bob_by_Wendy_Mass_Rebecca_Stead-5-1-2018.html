What We Say
With a well-earned nod to Edward Eager's "Half Magic" and other gentle tales of fantasy, acclaimed authors Wendy Mass and
Rebecca Stead team up for this middle-grade story. Eleven year old Livy was just a kid (only five years old!) the last timeshe traveled from the US to visit her grandmother in Australia. So it's no surprise she doesn't remember much of anything
about the farm her Gran lives on or the girl Livy befriended at the local restaurant or the green zombie that has been
waiting patiently in her guest room closet all this time because Livy said she'd be right back. Wait. What??!! Actually, thisfriendly -- if understandably miffed -- creature isn't a zombie, though neither Bob (that's his name) or Livy is exactly sureShare This Book

<p>what he might be. They piece the puzzle together thanks to clues like a chipped pawn on a chess board, an abandoned
well, a big book of fairy tales and a missing boy. The timeless banter of Livy and Bob might have been written one hundred
years ago and is surely this modest novel's strength. It's not distinctive or fresh enough to be judged a classic, but "Bob" is
appealingly low-key and the charming illustrations of Nicholas Gannon are a definite plus. -- Michael Giltz
