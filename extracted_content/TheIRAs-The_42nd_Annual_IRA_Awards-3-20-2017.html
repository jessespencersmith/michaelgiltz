42nd Annual IRA Movie Awards -- History Is
Made And We Don't Even Screw Up The
Envelopes!
The 42st Annual IRA FILM AWARD WINNERS -- 2016
The IRAs are a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the
best films of the year since 1976. Officially known as the New York
Independent Film Critics Awards but lovingly nicknamed the IRAs, it is
more international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial
than the LA Film Critics, more loyal to their favorites than the Golden
Globes. The IRAs are proud to announce their picks for the best movies
released in 2016.
The IRAs began when passionate film students and friends complained
about the parade of annual awards shows, declaring, "We could do
better!" What followed was an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to
establish the very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is
named Ira, but how his name became the name of the award is a story
lost in the mist of time.) The IRAs has been profiled in  The New
Yorker so it is officially a New York institution, though no one has ever
heard of it . Over the years, its rotating cast of voting members have
included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio execs, best-
selling and critically acclaimed authors of books on movies, critics,
screenwriters, budding playwrights, plain old film buffs and so on. 
Every year, the IRAs shine a light on some of the best films of the year.
The secret reason the IRAs flourish is that its members are passionate
film lovers. Many have careers involving the arts but it's not always
easy to stay in the swim of things and keep on top of the flood of new
releases every year, especially when the movies favored by IRA
members are not always playing at your local multiplex for weeks at a
time. The movies they appreciate tend to be harder to catch, playing in
theaters only briefly before popping up (hopefully) on some streaming
service or DVD if you miss it. Quite simply, the IRAs force them to stay
committed to seeing new movies with the same fervor they felt in their
college days when going to see a film was the only purpose in life,
before jobs and family made claims on their time. So if you want to stay
on top of great cinema every year or explore its history, there's no
better place to start than the award winners of the IRAs. 
True, the IRAs have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the
year than anyone else. But they've been doing it for decades so, hey, it's
tradition! And the IRA goes to....
BEST PICTURE
1. Moonlight  -- 25  pts.  (out of a possible 40 pts.)
2. Hell Or High Water -- 20  pts.
3. Dheepan -- 18  pts.
4. The Witch 12 pts.
5. (tie)  American Honey 9 pts.
    (tie)  Jackie 9 pts.
NOTE: When there's a tie, the number of films tied fill up a
corresponding number of slots. Here, two films tied for #5, so six films
make the final list. This year a record low eight ballots were submitted
with a top score for each film of 5 pts, so the maximum any one film
could achieve was 40 pts. For the first time in 40 years and only the
second time in IRA history, the winner of Best Picture also won the
Academy Award for Best Picture. The last time that happened, IRA and
Oscar agreed on Woody Allen's Annie Hall. In other words, this almost
never happens. Is it a sign of smarter voting by the Oscars, thanks to
new members and new voting procedures? More likely it's a fluke and
this convergence won't happen again until 2057. Typically, attacking a
potential winner by mocking it for having already won the Oscar is a
winning strategy, whether one thinks this means awarding the film is
pointless, redundant or most often simply suspect because the
Academy Awards has bad taste. This year, that tactic died simply
because too many people liked  Moonlight  too passionately. Is it their
fault Oscar got it right for a change? A stopped clock, etc. Welcome to
picking good movies, Academy Awards! When you agree with us, you're
doing something  right.
The IRAs are voted on from Best Costumes up to Best Picture. So this
award comes towards the end of the evening. The victory
of Moonlight  is no surprise, really: it won four of the Top 12 awards,
usually by a substantial margin and placed strongly in others. (There
are also "negative" awards, like Mechanical Actor for those phoning it
in.) Clearly Moonlight 's support was deep and strong. Still, sweeps are
not the IRA way. The result? Six films enjoyed all or part of the top six
awards for the night, thanks to one actor being honored for work on
two films. The six films are  A Bigger Splash; Dheepan; Hail, Caesar!;
Hell Or High Water; Indignation; Moonlight  and 20th Century
Women. 
BEST DIRECTOR
1. Barry Jenkins for Moonlight -- 26 pts.
2. Jacques Audiard for  Dheepan -- 18 pts.
3. David Mackenzie for  Hell Or High Water -- 17 pts.
4. (tie) Andrea Arnold for  American Honey -- 8 pts.
    (tie) Pablo Larrain for  Jackie -- 8 pts.
NOTE: While the IRA voters are not officially signatories to the
International Code Of Auteurs, they do tend to link picture and director
pretty strongly. But not that strongly. You will find ties amongst
directors or one person winning Best Picture and their main
competitor winning Best Director. Not this time. The good will Barry
Jenkins banked with his debut Medicine For Melancholy  back in 2008
helped fend off all pretenders and he won Best Director, pointing the
way to his final victory with Best Picture.
BEST ACTOR
1. Antonythasan Jesuthasan for Dheepan  -- 19 pts.
2. (tie) Colin Farrell for  The Lobster -- 16 pts.
    (tie) Peter Simonischek for  Toni Erdmann -- 16 pts.
4. Tom Hanks for  Sully and A Hologram For The King-- 14 pts.
5. Chris Pine for Hell Or High Water and The Finest Hours -- 11 pts.
NOTE: Here we see the passion for past IRA winner Jacques Audiard's
Dheepan , not to mention the wide net cast by the members. Moonlight
was filled with supporting actors, due to its unusual structure. Still, this
one category roped in four more films for award attention, including
the divisive comedy The Lobster  and some serious support for Hanks
in Hologram , which not enough members saw for it to gain
momentum. We have placed the first name of the actor from
Dheepan  first to reflect the Western style, so when you bump him on
the street, you can say, "Congrats on your IRA Award, Mr. Jesuthasan!"
and get his name right.
BEST ACTRESS
1. Annette Bening for 20th Century Women -- 15 pts.
2. Sasha Lane for  American Honey -- 13 pts.
3. Sandra Hüller for Toni Erdmann -- 12 pts.
4. Royalty Hightower for The Fits -- 11 pts.
RESCINDED: Isabelle Huppert for  Elle and Things To Come -- 19 pts.
NOTE: Here's one of the night's main controversies. The IRAs have
featured perhaps 15 or so members voting in any one year. But this
time, while eleven members voted on our list for the Best Films Of The
1940s, only eight weighed in on this year's annual awards. (Members
were overwhelmed with work or life issues or simply felt they didn't see
enough new movies to vote with integrity -- at least, those are among
the more popular reasons for begging off.) The danger of a really small
voting body is that two or three members can vote for a movie and
come out on top even if the vast majority don't approve. Similarly, a
film that lots of people liked but didn't love can become the consensus
bland choice simply because a number of folk had it third on their list.
And yet, no one is happy with the result. To avoid this, we have the
RESCIND option. After every winner is announced, an automatic vote
to rescind is held. If a majority of members vote to rescind, that award
is rescinded and the runner-up is crowned the winner. Then a vote to
rescind THAT winner is held and so on until the vote to rescind fails.
This year, the great Isabelle Huppert (a past IRA winner) won for her
two performances, Elle and Things To Come. However, a combination
of believing she had won too many honors already and that this wasn't
the right time to honor her again (and some serious distaste for Elle,
whatever one thought of her performance) led to a vote to rescind. It
meant sweet victory for Bening, who previously had been tarred and
feathered by IRA for delivering a Mechanical Actress performance and
now was laureled for doing it right.
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
1. Ralph Fiennes for A Bigger Splash and Hail, Caesar! --
18 pts.
2. Mahershala Ali for Hidden Figures and  Moonlight -- 16 pts.
3. Ben Foster for  Hell Or High Water -- 14 pts.
4. Patch Darragh for  Sully --10 pts.
5. (tie) Michael Barbieri for  Little Men -- 9 pts.
    (tie) Dev Patel for Lion -- 9 pts.
NOTE: This award was mainly for Fiennes' wonderfully irritating turn
in A Bigger Splash.  His amusing bit as a director saddled with an
incompetent actor in Hail, Caesar!  was just a sweet bonus.
Moonlight  didn't win here perhaps because the excellent Ali has been
so roundly and rightly singled out by virtually every other award group
in the country. And still he almost pulled it off, proving the depth of
support his film enjoyed.
                                            
BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
1. Linda Emond for Indignation -- 18 pts.
2. Imogen Poots for  Green Room  -- 16 pts.
3. Riley Keough for American Honey-- 14 pts.
4. Katy Mixon for  Hell Or High Water -- 10pts.
5. Janelle Monáe for Hidden Figures  and Moonlight -- 9 pts.
 
NOTE: Just like the Oscars, the IRAs have a complicated relationship
with supporting actor categories. Here they single out Emond in
Indignation , a blink and you miss it performance and a film almost
completely ignored by everyone else. Ditto Mixon, the other waitress
with a memorable scene in Hell Or High Water.  And here's the final
mention of Green Room,  a terrific B movie wrongly ignored by
Hollywood that isn't award bait for Oscar (it's too violent) but is a
calling card of a breakthrough akin to Reservoir Dogs  in terms of tight
and effective direction.
BEST NONFICTION FILM
1. O.J.: Made In America -- 23 pts.
2. Under The Sun -- 12 pts.
3. The Witness -- 10 pts.
4. Weiner -- 9 pts.
5. 13th -- 5 pts.
NOTE: Again, this is only the second time in history that the IRA Best
Picture winner is the same as the Academy Award winner. Last year the
IRAs added best nonfiction film and it's possible the overlap in that
category may be more consistent. Certainly everybody and their mother
praised O.J.: Made In America  and rightly so. Some IRA members (Ok,
me) argued it was THE best film of the year and should win the top
prize just like previous Best Picture winner, Eyes On The Prize. (Also a
lengthy documentary technically made for TV but eligible since it was
released in movie theaters.)
BEST SCREENPLAY
1. Taylor Sheridan for Hell Or High Water -- 18  pts.
2. Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney for  Moonlight  -- 16 pts.
3. Jacques Audiard and Thomas Bidegain and Noé Debré for  Dheepan -
- 13 pts.
4. Whit Stillman for  Love And Friendship  --9 pts.
5. (tie) Maren Ade for  Toni Erdmann  -- 8 pts.
   (tie) Mike Mills for  20th Century Women  -- 8 pts.
NOTE: It felt like Dheepan  was the best challenger to head off
Moonlight . But in fact, perhaps it was Hell Or High Water.  Its sole win
came right here for Best Screenplay. But Hell Or High Water featured
in eight of the 12 top categories, just like Moonlight . However you rank
them and judge their relative support among IRA voters, there's no
question Moonlight and Dheepan and Hell Or High Water were the
three most popular films of the year.
BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY
1. James Laxton for Moonlight -- 30 pts.
2. Paul Yee for  The Fits -- 14 pts.
3. Giles Nuttgens for  Hell Or High Water -- 13 pts.
4. Robby Ryan for  American Honey and I, Daniel Blake  -- 11 pts.
5. Sean Porter for  Green Room  and  20th Century Women -- 8 pts.
 
NOTE: We live in a golden age for cinematography; often this category
is a blood sport with many films scoring support and separated only by
a vote or two. Not this year, with Moonlight 's stellar work more than
doubling the impressive indie The Fits. When we saw Moonlight  simply
crushing the competition in Score and Cinematography and in the mix
elsewhere, it was clear early on this would be Moonlight 's night and
that IRA was not going to be afraid to single out the same movie as the
Academy Awards.
BEST PRODUCTION DESIGN
1. (tie)  Craig Lathrop for The Witch -- 15 pts.
    (tie)  Ryan Warren Smith for Green Room -- 15 pts.
3. Kelly McGehee for  American Honey -- 13 pts.
4. (tie) Alan MacDonald for  Florence Foster Jenkins -- 9 pts.
    (tie) David Wasco for  La La Land -- 9 pts.
NOTE: Here's a category that often has so many diverse possibilities
that just a few members can push a wild card over the top. Green Room
and The Witch  are two exceptionally good films pretty much ignored by
every other award group in the country. With its win here and runner-
up status in Best Costumes, for a brief moment the supporters of Green
Room fantasized about pulling off the upset of the century. But a strong
showing in technical categories can often be misleading and that's
exactly what happened here.
BEST SCORE/USE OF MUSIC
1. Nicholas Britell for Moonlight -- 27 pts.
2. Mica Levi for  Jackie -- 13 pts.
3. Becky Bentham for  Sing Street -- 12 pts.
4. Jóhann Jóhannsson  for  The Arrival -- 10 pts.
5. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis for  Hell Or High Water  --9 pts.
NOTE: If there was any consensus about Moonlight, it was that the
film's score and cinematography were brilliant. Not just for a very low
budget indie film but for any film.
BEST EDITING
1. Andrey Paperniy for Under The Sun -- 15 pts.
2. Joi McMillon and Nat Sanders for  Moonlight -- 14 pts.
3. Joe Bini for  American Honey -- 13 pts.
4. Sebastián Sepúlveda for  Jackie  -- 10 pts.
5. Blu Murray for  Sully -- 6 pts.
NOTE: Documentaries often score highly in the editing category
because they typically include a wealth of footage and the movie is
"discovered" in the editing. This year, that was particularly true for
Under The Sun, a documentary about North Korea in which the
filmmaker had no control over his own project once he arrived in that
nightmarish totalitarian state. The government controlled every
element but the director kept the camera rolling and captured all the
artifice involved in staging scenes, such as changing the jobs of the little
girl's parents so those would reflect better on the country and so on.
With minimal text explanation and no voice-over, the film is edited to
give a glimpse of the face the gov't wanted to present to the world and
how it was accomplished. Sad, funny, unnerving and truly created in
the editing room.
BEST COSTUME
1. Madeline Fontaine for Jackie -- 17 pts.
2. Amanda Needham for  Green Room  -- 14 pts.
3. Linda Muir for  The Witch -- 10 pts.
4. Kari Perkins for  Everybody Wants Some!! -- 9 pts.
5. Consolata Boyle for  Florence Foster Jenkins  -- 8 pts.
SOMINEX (The movie that put you to sleep)
1. The Girl On The Train -- 14 pts.
2. Hidden Figures -- 11 pts.
3. (tie)  Café Society -- 7 pts.
    (tie)  Knight Of Cups -- 7  pts.
5. Tallulah -- 6 pts.
             
DRAMAMINE (The film that made you sick)
Nocturnal Animals  by acclamation!
1. Nocturnal Animals  by acclamation
2. Hacksaw Ridge --  11 pts.
3. Manchester By The Sea --  9 pts.
4. I Am Not Y our Negr o-- 4 pts.
5. (tie)  The Eagle Huntr ess -- 3 pts.
    (tie)  Florence Foster Jenkins --  3 pts.
NOTE:  If a majority of the voters participating in the IRAs
each year (some members vote in absentia via ballot) nominate
the same person or ﬁlm in a category , that nominee is the
winner by acclamation. They garnered a majority of support on
the ﬁrst ballot. We then go through our ballots to see the other
honorees, but the winner is foreordained.   That was the case
here with Nocturnal Animals, which was  derided by all who
saw it.
MECHANICAL ACTRESS
1. Nicole Kidman for  Lion --  14 pts.
2. Michelle Williams for  Manchester By The Sea --  11 pts.
3. (tie) Leslie Mann for  By The Comedian and How T o Be
Single  -- 5 pts.
    (tie) Natalie Portman for A Tale Of Love And Darkness --
5 pts.
    (tie) Meryl Streep for Florence Foster Jenkins --  5 pts.
 
NOTE: The Mechanical awards are for actors relying on
familiar tricks we've seen them use time and again or those
tackling a role in a cliched manner . It's a moment for poisonous
comments, getting revenge on movies and talent we once
admired that have let us down or never fooled us in the ﬁrst
place and yet keep making moves we have to see. 
               
MECHANICAL ACTOR
Aaron Taylor-Johnson for Nocturnal Animals by
acclamation!
1. Aaron Taylor -Johnson for  Nocturnal Animals --  24 pts.
2. Ben Afﬂeck for  The Accountant, Batman v Superman: Dawn
Of Justice, Live By Night, Suicide           Squad  -- 18 pts.
3. (tie) Jovan Adepo for  Fences  -- 4 pts.
    (tie) Casey Afﬂeck for  Manchester By The Sea  -- 4 pts.
    (tie) Simon Helber g for Florence Foster Jenkins --  4 pts.
    (tie) Chris Pine for  Hell Or High W ater -- 4 pts.
