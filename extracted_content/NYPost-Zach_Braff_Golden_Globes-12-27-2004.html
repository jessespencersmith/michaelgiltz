'~ld7( V'1 
By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
U· NTIL this year, actor 
Zach Braff had never 
won any award. Noth­
ing. Nada. Zip. 
"Not even a Little 
League award," laughs 
the New Jersey native 
and star of NBC's 
"Scrubs." 
"I joked when I got my 
first award of this year 
that I was going to glue a 
little guy playing baseball 
to the top of it," says 
Braff, "so I could have an 
award like my brothers." 
He's going to need a 
steady supply of those 
little plastic guys in the 
future. 
Braff scored a Humani­
tas Award nomination for 
the screenplay to "Gar­
den State," his directorial 
debut, which comes out 
on DVD tomorrow. 
It's a fitting place to 
start since the Humanitas 
is one of the few awards 
scored by the critically 
acclaimed "Scrubs" 
(Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m.) 
after four seasons of 
being mostly ignored by 
the Emmys. 
But it's not the last 
award he's gotten. 
"Garden State" -the 
story of a fitfully success­
ful actor headed back to 
New Jersey to bury his 
mother, make peace with 
his estranged father, and 
make out with Natalie 
Portman (not in that 
order) -was also singled 
out by the National Board of Review, got two Inde­
pendent Spirit Awards, 
and two People's Choice 
Awards. 
And the soundtrack 
Braff oversaw (featuring 
everyone from critical 
faves The Shins to suicid­
ally sad, cult-figure Nick 
Drake) just went gold and 
is nominated for a 
Grammy. 
So maybe he should 
have sensed something 
was in the air this year 
come Golden Globes 
time? 
"Yeah!" says Braff, who 
was nominated for Best 
"I joked when 1 got 
my first award of 
this year that 1 was 
going to glue a 
little guy playing 
baseball to the 
top of it." 
Actor in a sitcom for 
"Scrubs." "But I didn't 
even wake up early this 
year. I wasn't expecting 
it." 
Fans worry all the suc­
cess will make Braff step 
away from the clever 
medical comedy that 
started it all. 
But Braff is delighted 
that "Scrubs" is still on 
the air despite never 
scoring huge ratings. His 
co-star, Donald Faison, is 
one of his best friends in 
real life and he's in no mood to see it 
end. 
"The show is 
so much fun 
to do," says 
the 
29-year-old 
Braff. "We 
don't have a 
huge fan base 
but we have a 
really loyal 
one. It looks 
like we're 
going to be 
around a little 
while longer. 
I know it will 
go another 
year. I don't 
want it to be 
over. It's a job 
where you 
come to work 
and make 
your friends 
laugh a lot." 
So despite 
some New 
Year's resolu­
tions posted 
on his blog 
("Forego all 
exercise -in­
cluding walk­
ing" and "Learn 
to smoke­
something thin 
like Capris"), 
Braff seems un­
likely to let this 
sudden success 
change him. 
Just ask who his date 
will be to the Golden 
Globes on Jan. 16. 
"I'm bringing my mom," 
says Braff. lach Braff, 
nominated for a 
Golden Globe 
as best comedy 
actor for 
"Scrubs," is 
on the verge 
of breaking 
out as a star.</p>
