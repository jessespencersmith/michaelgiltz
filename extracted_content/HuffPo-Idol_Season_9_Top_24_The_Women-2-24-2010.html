Now it gets fun. Most of us only sit through the
auditions and Hollywood Week to get to the live
performances on American Idol.  But before the
singing began, the show smartly dealt with Ellen
sitting as far away from Simon as possible. They just
showed a joke video where Simon was hitting on
Ellen. On the other hand, he did look a little peevish,but that might just have been Simon. He also said thisyear belonged to the women. But so far it only belongs
to one. (Hint: she plays the harmonica.)
PAIGE MILES  -- Sang "All Right Now," the sole Top 10 hit by Free. Paige looked cute and it was smart
to get Tina Turner-ish on a rock song. But this tune has a very minor range and her attempt at a big last
note ended abruptly. By the end of the night, however, I agreed more with the judges who were kind.Kara made a silly ghetto comment with "You got a ridiculous voice, girl!" But Randy had the best insight
into why the song was a boring choice for a solo act: the chorus is a big sing-along moment and just
sounds weaker sung alone.
ASHLEY RODRIGUEZ  -- Sang "Happy" the #31 hit (#2 in the UK) from Leona Lewis's second album.
Maybe she was trying to butter up Simon, since Lewis is the biggest act to come out of his show The X
Factor . Unfortunately, it was so-so, with a slow start and many rough patches.
JANELL WHEELER  -- Sang "What About Love?," the iconic Top 10 hit by Heart. She looked cute but
the song overwhelmed her. She was rough on the verses, very thin on the big notes and only sounded okon the chorus because the backup singers carried her. Not one good passage.
LILLY SCOTT  -- Sang the Beatles classic "Fixing A Hole" from Sgt. Pepper . (Sounds awesome in mono,
by the way.) Great choice with a good arrangement that's right in her wheelhouse. The only problem was
her singing. She was draggy and flat at times and her scatting sort of "ow ow ows" felt forced. The bridge
where she got a little spirited and sang with more passion was the only bright spot. But as the judges say-- however, I like her vibe.

<p>KATHELYN EPPERLY  -- Sang the Beatles classic "Oh, Darling" from Abbey Road , which was a #15
hit for Robin Gibb from the godawful Bee Gees film thingy of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band . I
liked her choice but was annoyed the producers put two mid-tempo Beatles songs back to back. (That
was before I realized there were three Beatles songs in a row. Still, they should have put other songs inbetween.) Lotta hair from Epperly and the leathery dress made her look too much like she was wearing acostume. But it was pretty good and straightforward.
HAELEY VAUGHN  -- The third and final Beatles song, this one a huge smash and their US
breakthrough "I Want To Hold Your Hand," which hit #1 for seven weeks here (not to mention the
delightful movie by Robert Zemeckis, I Wanna Hold Your Hand . Rent it!) She started too high, which
immediately got me worried and was flat at times and ran out of breath by the end of lines. But she's
always had a little voice and the Jason Mraz vibe was fun. Fun is definitely the word. And sweet. But sheneeds to work better in her limited range; the cuteness won't be enough.
LACEY BROWN  -- Sang Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide," perhaps my favorite song on my favorite album
of theirs, the eponymous Fleetwood Mac . (It didn't chart until Smashing Pumpkins broke into the Top
40 for the first time with it in 1994, then Fleetwood did a live version that went to #51 in the 90s and
finally the great Dixie Chicks took it to #7 in 2002 on their album Home , one of the best albums of the
decade.) It's a quiet song, but not slow; in fact, it's surprisingly light on its feet. Lacey seemed to be tryingto slow it down and seemed uncomfortable every step of the way. Boring. Ellen said, "I think you're better
than that," continuing her trend of being honest but supportive, sort of a sane Paula Abdul when it
comes to trying to be a cheerleader for them to do their best without her being mindless. Simon was rightto call it indulgent.
MICHELLE DELAMOR  -- Sang "Fallin'" by Alicia Keys, which shows a notable lack of imagination for
someone who should be trying to stand out. Overdone for auditions, performed all the time until the
judges and we are sick of it. Of all the songs that have ever charted on Billboard (the very broad category
for the night), was that really the best song she could choose? Kara kept talking to Simon but they wereall kinder than I expected. She was breathy and had an ok middle but was basically forgettable.
DID BENAMI  -- Sang Ingrid Michaelson's Top 40 hit "The Way I Am." She looked very cute and
immediately struck me as looking confident. A rough last note was a shame because I thought she was
pretty good overall. In the race to be Adele or Duffy (or Madeleine Peyroux) I thought she outpaced Lilly
Scott tonight.
SIOBHAN MAGNUS  -- Sang "Wicked Game" by Chris Isaak." I was so happy before the break when
Ryan Seacrest announced she'd be singing Isaak. He has a catalog of terrific pop tunes that are
immediately catchy a la Roy Orbison, which are perfect for mining on the show and yet not so familiarthat they would seem obvious. Unfortunately, Siobhan chose the obvious tune, his only Top 40 hit and
one that can be pretty draggy in unsafe hands. Siobhan had stood out for me so I'm bummed she went
the dowdy, cocktail lounge route in her rendition, though she built a little steam on the emphatic bridge.But overall, too slow. Plus, the band sounded like it was in the next room (as it did on most tunes,
obviously a choice by the producers). On the bright side, she had some cute friends in the audience.
CRYSTAL BOWERSOX  -- Sang Alanis Morissette's #15 hit "Hand In My Pocket." Bowersox has been
an early standout and now that increases by a factor of 10. She was an instant standout from the moment
she began singing. Yes, Morissette is a singer-songwriter, but I don't think most think of her in theDylan/folkie vein. Bowersox was her own woman (even during other people's songs when she seemed to
just quietly watch from the balcony, rather than playing at cheering them on or clapping). And there was
a harmonica break! Puts her way, way, way out front of the others in my book. The judges were morereserved when I would have given her a standing O right off the bat. Not a brilliant vocal or stunningly
original arrangement but it felt fresh and genuine and real and I wished she could have kept singing.
KATIE STEVENS  -- Sang "Feelin' Good"  by (as Ryan Seacrest put it) MIchael Buble. No one's ever hit
the Hot 100 with it, but surely this number from the Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse musical The Roar
Of The Greasepaint -- The Smell Of The Crowd  still belongs to Nina Simone if anyone. The 17-year-old
looked too dolled up, which made the whole number feel like play-acting to me, like a girl dressing up
and singing along in her bedroom. I immediately wrote down that Simon would tell her to act her
age...but Ellen beat him to it. Randy correctly pointed out that her big problem was oversinging notes and
going sharp (is it my imagination or is he stepping it up this season?) and Simon nailed it by calling herperformance "pageant-y."
At the end, as the end credits rolled and the music played, some of the girls danced along, as they will.
But Crystal sort of jokingly/half-heartedly danced along for a moment...and then turned her back on the
camera to focus on people in the audience. A big deal? Nope, the show was over and maybe as far as she
knew they'd already cut away. But that casual ability to not feel pressured into soaking up every second of

Weight...face time speaks volumes to her confidence and sense of who she is. Bopping around on stage to the
music wouldn't help her anyway, would it? If you haven't guessed, I'm a fan.
Impossible to say which two will go, so I'll just say that Bowersox is safe. It won't surprise me who else is
eliminated. If social networking means anything (and at this early stage, your built-in fan base can keepyou safe), it's worth pointing out that three women are in the bottom four when it comes to fans onFacebook and followers on Twitter: Haeley Vaughn, Michelle Delamor and Paige Miles (who also had the
double whammy of going first).
Who was your favorite? Your least favorite? Any ideas which two will go home Thursday?

59 Fansare pushing so hard that it falls flat. Although it still surprises me how many try to sound like the
artist they are singing - they just can't cut it. Being original is how they advance on the show - any
fan knows that.
I think the bottom three mentioned are indeed the bottom three. But I would never have the guts to do what these kids are doing, so kudos to them for getting up
there and trying.
I also heard the hype that the girls had the talent this year and, besides Crystal, most were
mediocre, if not awful.
I have not been an Idol fan. I have only watched Season 8 after hearing the swirling rumors of how
incredible Adam Lambert was as a singer. So, after hearing that Season 9 was suppose to havemore talented singers I did tune in. I was left disappoint ed. I really didn't see any really talented
singers last night. They were sweet and most of them mildly enjoyable but the hype was just that..Hype. Granted, I do not drink the American Idol Kool-Aid so, I am probably more critical. I won'ttune in again, it's too painful to watch these kids be confronted by Simon..eve n when or if he is
right at times, he is still annoying to me.
Obviously the show isn't your cup of tea. But I will say that there's a steep learning curve.Performing with a profession al band and an ear piece to hear your voice in front of a large
audience is a huge leap -- something that most amateurs never do. Now do it in front ofmillions of people. Typically, we get to the Top 12 and four or five or six are so-so and youthink, really? Are these the best singers they could find? It's not unusual especially on theirfirst live performanc e to see many of them fail. But they practice and learn and get better.
That's how they end up with one or two people who are actually good and can make theleap to a real career. And it's not Kool Aid. Grammy and Oscar winners and some of thetop-sellin g artists of the decade come from the show. But at least you checked it out, which
is better than dismissing it sight unseen. It's just a talent show, where as in all talent showsthe dross far outweighs the gold.MORE BIG NEWS PAGES  »
