Great soundtracks that matched sight and sound BY MICHAEL GILT~ 
A great film score doesn't always equal a great 
soundtrack. (Do you really want to listen to 
the John Williams music for "Jaws" while 
driving home?) And sometimes a bad movie can 
produce a great soundtrack. ("Streets of Fire," 
anyone?). So, after you buy the "Dreamgirls" CD, 
hel'e are the best soundtracks and scores re­
leased in 2006 -the CDs you'll actually want to 
listen to after the movie is over. • "LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR 
MAN" This concert film tribute to 
the Canadian musical bard was 
peopled by curator Hal Willner with 
built-to-endure talents like Antony. 
U2 and Rufus Wainwright. Among 
many highlights , Teddy Thomp­
son's aching "Tonight Will Be Fine" 
stands out, II "LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE" The secret 
weapon in this indie comedy's success­
ful run at the box office was the play­
ful score of Mychael Danna, along 
with Sufjan Stevens and super­
freak Rick James thrown in for 
good measure. 
• "THE ILLUSIONIST" Philip Glass de­
livers a more typical score for "Notes on 
a Scandal," but here proves how adaptable 
his distinctive, increasingly romantic style is, 
.. SING·A·LONGS & LULLABIES FOR THE 
FILM "CURIOUS GEORGE" No other movie 
soundtrack united the entire family the way 
this amiable work did, thanks to mellow surf­
er-musician Jack Johnson, songs like "Up­
side Down" and friends like rockers the White 
Stripes, 
.. "THE PROPOSITION" Nick Cave and War­
ren Ellis of the Bad Seeds deliver the eeriest, 
most provocative score for a Western since 
Neil Young's music for "Dead Man." Spooky. 
I'll "A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION" DELUXE 
EDITION Garrison I~eillor, Lily Tomlin, Woody 
limreison and Meryl Streep ail shine as per· 
lormers in Robert Altman's final film. The 
t'OIlUS DVD contains even more treasures. j THE 
J MONKEY 
SHINES 
"Curious 
George" 
had swin· 
gin'tunes. 
" "THE FOUNTAIN" Audiences 
may have been confused by this ro­
mantic sci-fi-fantasy, but the mourn­
ful score by Clint Mansell (with help fmm 
Kronos Quartet and Mogwai) won't be de­
nied, 
II "BABEL" The globe-trotting movie has an 
appropriately globe-trotting soundtrack with 
moody film music by Gustavo Santaolalla 
alongside Japanese pop and a good helpirig 
of norteno. ' . 
• "VOLVER" Pedro Almodovar's long-term : 
collaboration with composer Alberto Iglesias 
is the most fruitful in cinema since Federico 
Fellini stayed faitllful to Nino Rota. 
III "BREAKFAST ON PLUTO" An eccentric, 
winning collection of offbeat pop songs, like 
Harry Nilsson's "Me and My A!TOW," the title 
tune by Don Partridge and even, yes, Morris 
Albert's U Feelings," which takes on creepy 
connotations after you've seen the film .•</p>
