WWI's horrors examined through the lens of its final hours 
11th Month, 11th Day, 11th Hour 
By Joseph E. Persico 
Random House, 456 pp., $29.95 
By Michael Giltz 
Special for USA TODAY 
The sanest day of World War I was 
probably Dec. 25, 1914. Fighters on 
both sides agreed to a cease-fire, met 
in no-man's land and shook hands. 
Carols were sung in the trenches. 
For those still alive some four years 
later, surely the craziest day was Nov. II, 1918. The armistice had been 
agreed upon early in the morning. 
But despite pleas from the beaten 
Germans to stop the fighting, Allied 
leaders would make it official only at 
the neat, round time of II/lIon the 
11th hour in the morning. 
Until then, everyone was urged to 
keep on fighting. The result? More 
men were killed and wounded on 
the final day -most of them after 
the armistice had been signed -
than on D-Day in World War II. 
Joseph Persico, author of the ac足
claimed Roosevelt's Secret War, uses that day as the touchstone for 11th 
Month, 11th Day, 11th Hour; Armistice 
Day, 1918: World War I and Its Violent 
Climax, an engrossing account of "the 
war to end all wars." But he doesri't 
focus on that final day until the last 
quarter of the book. 
First, Persico introduces us to 
some of the war's participants and 
tells us what they were doing during 
the fateful hours leading up to 
11 a.m. on Nov. 11. Many of the fight足
ers must have looked back at what 
they had been through. Persico, too, 
looks back at key events in their war-time experience . He illuminates key 
battles in which the men fought, and 
he recounts their first days in the 
trenches as well as other telling mo足
ments. One grim question hovers 
over all these scenes: Had the men 
survived years of hell only to die in 
the war's last minutes? 
With admirable skill, Persico 
weaves in every facet of World War I: 
how it began, life in the trenches and 
the plague of rats. He includes the 
poetry and the rah-rah patriotism on 
the home front, which contrasted 
with the cynical attitude in the trenches. He avoids romantic notions 
of war. But heroes do emerge -fam足
ous ones such as George Patton and 
Alvin York; lesser-known figures 
such as Pvt. Joseph Oklahombi, a 
Choktaw Indian; and, above all, the 
regular Tommies and doughboys 
who fought and died and sometimes 
endured. 
It may seem ironic that so many 
died after the armistice was signed. 
But Persico explains why the final, 
bloody day of World War I was not 
ironic or tragic -not when you 
know the horrors that preceded it</p>
