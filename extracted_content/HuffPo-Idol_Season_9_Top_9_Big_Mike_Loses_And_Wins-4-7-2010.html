In a dramatic moment on American Idol,  Michael
Lynche received the fewest votes from the public and
was in danger of being cut from the show -- a classic
case where a talented performer somehow fell throughthe cracks and the very reason the "save" was
invented. And indeed, the judges used their save and
Michael Lynche is still in the competition. That meansnext week two contestants will be cut from the showno matter what.
The night began with the Idol  contestants doing a Beatles medley. I can't be certain they were lip-syncing
but I believe they were. Frankly, simply the idea that their performance seemed canned is bad enough.
They all looked great in mod, black and white Sixties outfits, especially Katie Stevens (who inexplicably
changed outfits during a commercial break).
All three women were pronounced safe (a gender breakdown that often happens when one sex
outnumbers the other). Kara DioGuardi protege Jason DeRulo performed a snippet of one tune and thenhis hit, "In My Head" with fire, backup singers, a dangerously studded jacket and dance moves that allechoed Michael Jackson. In a strange gambit, they switched to slo-mo black and white in the middle of
the live performance. Not a wise move for a new artist to my thinking -- let us get caught up in the
moment; don't let us feel like we're watching a video. It was ok overall, though the song was weak.
David Archuleta delivered a piano-led encore of his rendition of "Imagine," this time including the lyrics
"Imagine there's no heaven" that he cleverly skipped when in competition. It was good and the best guestperformance of the night. Has he dyed his hair?
Rihanna performed a Grammy-worthy spectacle of her new single "Rock Star 101." Another hip-hop song
weak on melody (it's certainly no "Umbrella") but she could sell millions of downloads by showing us
how she slipped into that skin-tight outfit.

Andrew was the only one the judges wouldn't have saved. Michael Lynche did another strong rendition ofKate Bush's "This Woman's Work" and Simon Cowell -- with his usual dramatic flair -- announced he wassafe. Who, I wonder, will be the lead judge next season? They're gonna miss Simon and it should be
Ellen, but will Randy feel dissed? What do you think? Who is the next lead judge and were they right to
save Michael Lynche, ie. could he be in the finals? Because if he doesn't deserve to be in the finals, you
shouldn't use the save.

I would only save someone I thought had a great shot at winning. I don't see Mike as winning this. 
I can't think of anyone who could command the respect that Simon has. I'll be watching Xfactor for
him. Idol would have to shock me with someone great/inte resting to keep me interested .
I agree with the judges using the save for Mike. This is exactly why it's there - to prevent a talented
and deserving singer from being booted off too early. Mike should have a shot at a record deal. Justbecause Ruben Studdard didn't sell records is no reason to deny Mike his chance at success.
The idea of someone as good as Mike leaving before the likes of Tim, Andrew or Aaron is simply
unacceptab le. It should have been Andrew going home last night. Then the judges could have kept
the save. Now the respective fan bases will have to come out in force to protect the favorites like
Crystal, Lee, Siobhan and Casey. But Mike is the best pure singer among the men and definitelydeserves another chance. I remember when Jennifer Hudson got voted off way too early when shewas on Idol. The save could have prevented that from happening. 
I also think Lee was terrible with "Hey Jude". He probably deserved to be in the bottom three just
for that debacle. Even though I like him, I thought this was a trainwreck . He sacrificed vocals for
performanc e.
Ruben has a far better voice - not to mention ability to hold a note longer - than Mike.Ruben comes off as far more genuine than Mike, too. BTW, the name of his family's groupis ...well, I'll just repost it here: The Lynche Mob. OMG
I thought the Lynche Mob was a pretty godawful name, too, I must admit. SinceJennifer Hudson could have made the finale, I think she was a shame to leaveearly. But unless you think the person should be in the finals, does it really matterif they leave a week or two earlier or later than they should?
Are you kidding Big Mike should be gone!

40 FansAlthough I think Mike has a great voice, he's not going to win this competitio n, so using the save on
him was a wasted effort. If it goes like last year when Matt was saved, then booted the following
week when two got the axe, it might be Mike AND Andrew next week, though I still don't know whatthe theme is for next week's show and will revise my bottom two accordingl y, when I find out what
it is.
I agree. I would only use the save if I thought the person being booted was going to have ashot at the finale. As for next week's bottom two, I assume that would be your prediction ,
right? We should at least let them sing before putting them at the bottom :)
They shouldn't have saved Big Obnoxious Poser. I'm still waiting for someone to tell him to keep hishands to himself. Go MamaSox, my favorite of all the Idols past or present.
Thank God for the Intelligen ce of the Audience!! ! 
All year long I've stated that Michael Lynche was not that good despite the opinions of the Judges
and the way the producers have made sure they high-light ed him every week. 
Finally last night the audience let everyone know Lynche is not that good. 
Why doesn't he audience like him? Simple.... . He does not look like an American Idol! 
Once again, this is a show about performing ..... It has nothing to do with Art or anything of that
nature.
I've been up and down on Michael Lynche myself. But one interestin g facet of Idol is that
the winner chose by audiences has rarely looked like the teen idol pin-up a record label
would choose or you might expect from bland popular taste. instead it's been Kelly Clarkson(just a regular gal when she won), the very heavy-set Ruben, fantasia (cool, but plenty ofbetter lookers were on the show), Taylor Hicks, etc. If audiences went for just the TigerBeat winner, Tim Urban would be a walk. I find that facet of the show pretty refreshing .
The judges were "a billion gazillion percent" right to use the save on Michael Lynche last night. Theman is a natural on stage and performs EVERY song straight from the heart and with profession al-
level artistry.
The problem with Idol is they have allowed the Bible Belt Brace-face s to completely dominate theFOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

166 Fansvoting results by not restrictin g votes to just ONE vote per phone number. You can see who is
doing all the voting by looking at the results each week. Contestant s of "color" are leaving early in
the game, while the remaining finalists all get increasing ly more MALE, younger, and WHITER.
(btw, I'm so white myself, I'm practicall y CLEAR, so no racial bias here, tyvm).
This is not a contest to see who is the best singer. It's a contest to see who will sell the most MP3
downloads to the Nickelodeo n crowd currently on the cusp between boys and Barbies.
I can't stand James' rapid vibrato. He sounds like a nervous Chihuahua. Aaron can't handle the lownotes; Andrew and Lee have great sounds, but poor stage presence. Katie needs more seasoning,but I like her strong alto pipes. Siobhan is a good singer with a unique style and a great gimmick inher high range. Tim Urban is Tiger Beat fodder, nothing more.
Crystal and Michael SHOULD be the top two finalists. The question is will the Brace Faces grow up
and let the most TALENTED get to the finals of a TALENT competitio n?
If its racial biased voting, how do you explain that two years in a row there were winnerswho were people of "color" as you put it, with Ruben and Fantasia.
Exactly, Linda. Those that show up here and try to make Idol a race-based contestare so out of it. Lynch is a goner because he is simply a mediocre performer. Youcould tell from the auditions this year that this was a decidedly down year forAfrican-Am erican contestant s.
I would imagine that's because most such contestant s that are serious about
getting record deals are into rap/hip hop, a genre that Idol's pop/countr y foundation
ignores. That leaves R&B crooners, a small niche in today's market, for people likeMike and Ruben, who was a better singer than Mike, yet went on to sell fewrecords.
The Save was wasted, cause he'll justifiabl y be gone next week anyway. The
show's always been a popularity contest, but calling Mike "the best singer" when
he clearly is not is simply wishful thinking, not reality-ba sed.

Every Idol winner has been from the South except for Jordin Sparks. But the show hasbeen so racially diverse -- including when the audience votes, not just the UN-like plottingof the producers for the Top 24 -- and physically diverse I wouldn't say it was raciallybiased at all. Three out of 8 winners have been black. I think the South dominates becauseof voting and the advantage of being from a little state. Big states on the coast like Florida,New York, California et al -- they don't really get excited by someone being in the top 10 oreven the finals. But a tiny state like Alabama can get really motivated and vote for theirhomegrown competitor . For reasons of self-mytho logy, I think Texas behaves like a little
state.
The save was predictabl e, once it was revealed who was at risk. 
We enjoyed Jason DeRulo's performanc e a lot! Thought he did an amazing job of it. Great dance
moves. Also liked the song enough to go listen to his first several recordings . Really like those, as
well. Also thought the slow mo stuff was fly. Sorry. :DPermalink  | Share it

59 FansRihanna, on the other hand. Big fan of hers - HUGE. It looked like a phone-in to me. Didn't care for
the song AT ALL. Tuneless mess. Not even a decent backbeat. Surprising .
You're right, the slo-mo was pretty cool on second viewing. And at least Rihanna lookedgood.
Personally , I don't understand what's gotten into America, seeing that Andrew is like a cat with 9
lives, and that Kate Gosslin(sp ?) on Dancing With The Stars, made it through another week as well.
Don't people have eyes and ears anymore?!? !? The woman moves as gracefully as a cow... Sorry!
Michael has one of the best vocals on American Idol(but he definitely needs to fine tune hisintrument) , whilst Andrew is a one-note-s amba. Everything sounds the same, and he really has no
voice. He's got a quirky voice, but that's it.The bottom three ought to have included Andrew, Aaron and actually Lee. I normally like him, buthe did a poor, poor job in his last performanc e, and the only thing that saved it was the bag pipe.
The best of the night was surprising ly enough, Casey. A wonderful rendition of one of my favourite
songs(Jeal ous Guy)!
A lot of disagreeme nt with you this week, Mr. Giltz.
I think this was the first week the live performanc e was actually live, and it sounded ten times better
than ever before.
I think the whole "Save Papa Mike" business was contrived from first to last. No one in their right
mind thinks Mike is going to win this thing, not the viewers and certainly not the judges. And after
Ruben Studdard sold virtually no records, the producers aren't going to let it happen.
So why waste the only Save on a singer who won't be a finalist? What if Crystal, Casey, Lee or
Siobhan end up chopped in the next two weeks. Saving Mike was the best use of that Save? Sure,they've played up the new daddy bit endlessly, but Andrew and Crystal are parents too, but it hasn'tbeen made a focal point of the show.
I think the judges used it because (1) They wanted to appear generous to the New Daddy (2) the
producers wanted to get it out of the way so we wouldn't have to go thru this excruciati ng huddling
during the swan-song song anymore (3) They wanted to use it up, so they wouldn't appear toinfluence the outcome as it gets closer to D-Day...ho w could you save Crystal if Casey got bounced
the following week...wou ldn't seem fair.
No question it was a risk using the save, but I suspected the minute Ryan said it would be
a surprise eliminatio n it was either going to be Siobhan or Michael on the block and would
have bet big money the Save was coming. I don't think the judges motives were as silly as
that. Rather, I think they view Michael Lynch as an artist with grea potential. No question inmy mind that, unless he radically screws up in coming weeks, he will get a contract, winlose or draw, from someone. Doesn't matter if he is in the Top Two. There is a good marketout there for him.Permalink  | Share it

43 FansThanks for commenting . On a second viewing, I think the live performanc e was live as well.
But I still didn't like it very much. While having successful artists gives the show essential
validity, what really makes money for the producers is the show itself. Great drama is whatmatters to them -- desperatel y trying to engineer a certain winner just isn't that important to
them, especially since they sign multiple people out of the top ten anyway. I personallywouldn't have used the Save. Other singers should have left before him, but he won't be inthe finals and if I don't think he should be in the finals there is no reason to use the Save.The order of when others go home just doesn't matter that much.
I was just sitting around thinking, "Was the Rihanna song on last night's show the worst song I'veever heard just on Idol or on TV, period, ever?" ... Oh wait, there was Puff Daddy's thing last week...
Back to more important business. One Beatle fanatic, reporting for duty. The "shhoommpp p" effect
in Come Together was derived from John tragi-prop hetically saying "Shoot me!" into the mic,
coupled with a slapback-d elay effect, masked by a single handclap. And there are four Beatles
song credited or co-credite d to Ringo Starr (as real name "Starkey") . Besides Don't Pass Me By
and Octopus's Garden there were What Goes On, credited to Lennon-McC artney-Sta rkey, and
Flying, from the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack , credited to Lennon-McC artney-Har rison-Star key. 
Technicall y, George should have received co-writing credit for "Octopus's Garden". He gave the
song a major overhaul between the time it was rehearsed during the Let It Be sessions and when it
was recorded for Abbey Road. But since George already had two very solid contributi ons going onto
Abbey Road -- including his first-ever A-side of a single with Something, as well as Here ComesThe Sun, he generously allowed Ringo to have the songwritin g spotlight alone.
Poor George, bursting with talent and Lennon/McC artney probably got antsy when he
wanted to include more than one tune. Of course, even when they kept his contributi on
down, those songs were "While My Guitar gently Weeps," "Here Comes The Sun,'" etc. Andthen Frank Sinatra goes and calls "Something " the greatest love song in ages and always
credited Lennon and McCartney. Sometimes you just can't win! Thanks for the info onRingo and the detail on John and "Come Together." I'd heard about "shoot me" before butdidn't realize it was supposed to be in that actual "shummmmpp pp" sound when he said it.
In case there was any doubt, the last season of "Idol" should have dispelled it. The winner of "Idol"is the person with the most sophistica ted campaign organizati on, not the person with the best
voice. Fox doesn't want to, or doesn't know how to, block programmed voting or timezone spoofingor any of the other tricks that have been used to game the voting. And maybe that's not a bad
thing. If their goal is to produce a successful artist, then maybe it makes sense for them to go with
the person who is best at working the system. Michael apparently doesn't have an organizati on that
is capable of engineerin g his victory, so it really doesn't matter how good his voice is. He won't win,
but he's a cool guy with a great voice, and he'll have a decent career.
The thing is, they get first refusals at offering record contracts to any and all of thecontestant s. So while there's a certain cachet in promoting a singer as an "American Idol",
for every Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, they also end up with a Taylor Hicks andRuben Studdard, who don't sell squat.
Which is why the voting is just a lure for the masses. They can let Kris Allen win, because
they are going to put out the records by Daughtry and Lambert as well, so they have all thePermalink  | Share it

And I have to disagree, I don't think Big Mike will have much of a career, outside of
lounges/di nner theatre/ma ybe Broadway. There already is a Luther Vandross, and he isn't
even charting these days...the money and sales are in Hip Hop/Rap, and Mike hasn'tshown any proclivity for that.
People watch "Idol", obsess on its participan ts, and forget how many unnoticed good
singers there are out there...I did a short documentar y film on church choirs, and my guess
is there isn't a Baptist church choir in the country that doesn't have a male and female
singer as good, and probably better, than Big Mike.
ummm, maybe the reason that luther isn't charting these days is because he'spassed away. it's difficult to release new material from the grave.
...but thanks for your insight. /snark

Studdard and Hicks both outsold Allen and Lambert so far, BTW. Actually Studdard
sold nearly 2 million copies of his debut CD, and Hicks 704,000 (Lambert sits atunder 600,000 and Allen under 300,000 at the moment.) The facts are that themarket is trending toward singles sales instead of album sales, and Allen's firstsingle, Live Like We're Dying has sold well over a Million Copies. In view of thischanging market it is really rather difficult as to who will sell well, but I personallythink that Lynche's style is passe.
David has sung the full version of Imagine many times. Don't worry. He still believes in Heaven andHell. BTW, his hair has always been super black.He is half Hispanic. His mother is Honduran. Hejust grew his hair out more recently.
Really? I've never heard him sing the full version... ever. Even last night he left out the line
"...and no religion too", which is the whole point of "the world living as one". Born-againtypes should steer clear of songs they either don't understand , or can't honor in their
entirety.

<p>0 Fansus" for "I hope some day you'll join us" to his dreary, overwrough t rendition of
Imagine last night. He did that a couple seasons back in competitio n as well. Not
cool. Don't mess with lyrics -- especially Lennon's and/or McCartney' s -- by
deleting OR altering. 
If one listens closely, he also sang "Imagine all the the people sharing FOR the
world" rather than "... sharing ALL the world." Subtle, arguably trivial. Still, dumb.And slightly changes meaning of song. That shouldn't really be an option.

David sang the full version including the verse with "no religion too" at Ford Daynot long after Idol. It was a special performanc e at Ford by both Davids. And he's
not born-again . He's Mormon. He's also one of the most humble, honest and kind
people I have ever encountere d, to the point where he just amazes me. And he's
a peace lover too, and never has an unkind word for anyone, even if the person isnasty. I am not Christian nor particular ly religious so that is not why I like him. And
he doesn't wear his religion on his sleeve and only talks about it if asked. He loveshis fans around the world including Jewish and Muslim fans and others. He is justa fine human being and I love his voice. Amazingly voice considerin g one of his
vocal cords was damaged with paralyzed when he was about 12. No autotune, nodancing girls, no fireworks needed. I am one of his many adult fans. I can't wait forhis upcoming single, book and album. And no he doesn't dye his hair - his hairwas just reflecting the colors of the lighting.
