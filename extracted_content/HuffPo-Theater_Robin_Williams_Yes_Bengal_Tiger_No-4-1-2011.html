BENGAL TIGER AT THE BAGHDAD ZOO  ** out of ****
RICHARD RODGERS THEATRE
Clearly, playwright Rajiv Jospeh is a talent. Earlier this
season, his show Gruesome Playground Injuries  played
Off Broadway. While not emotionally involving, it wascleverly constructed and inspired top work fromeveryone involved. His new drama Bengal Tiger At TheBaghdad Zoo  was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize after
world premiering in Los Angeles. And now it's openingon Broadway with Robin Williams as the tiger.
But he's still finding his way as an artist; his plays feel
technically proficient but not burning with desire to tell
this particular story or reveal that  particular character. Joseph's main driving force at the moment seems
to be the understandable desire simply to be a playwright. It's not that Joseph is showing off. In fact, hisflashier conceits are often the most effective, most theatrical parts of his shows. But he's yet to find therich emotional vein that will allow him to combine his obvious skill with insight and heart. It will come.
Bengal Tiger  begins with a bang. Williams is a tiger being guarded by two soldiers after the invasion of
Iraq -- Tom (Glenn Davis) and not-so-bright Kev (Brad Fleischer). The tiger mocks the soldiers and talks
to the audience but the soldiers only hear its growls. Tom thinks it's hungry and foolishly offers a piece offood, only to have the tiger snap off his hand. Kev kills the tiger, but that doesn't stop Williams from

<p>talking: He starts to haunt Kev day and night.
Soon, the stage is crowded with ghosts. The tiger is haunted by a little girl who had half her face blown
off and keeps crying. Kev is haunted by the tiger and then starts to haunt Tom himself. Tom somehowgets reassigned to duty even though he's missing one hand. Tom's interpreter is really a gardener, an
artist, who always makes the mistake of working for the tyrants.
First the interpreter Musa (a fine Arian Moayed) was a gardener for Uday Hussein, ignoring the brutal
way the Husseins held power in exchange for the chance to sculpt beautiful topiary hedges in the shapesof animals, like an elephant and a giraffe. Musa's little Eden of a garden is destroyed when he brings hislittle sister to see the garden and she's raped and killed by Uday. Uday was killed by the Americans buthaunts Musa and urges him on to violence. Instead, Musa works for the Americans, who loot his country
of trinkets and force him to interpret requests for sex between soldiers and young prostitutes.
Everyone is troubled and unhappy and soon most everyone is addressing God, quite loudly and
vociferously, if not exactly in an original manner. They're certainly not the first people to ask God how hecould allow a world in which sad and terrible things happen. The second act in particular is filled withexistential mutterings and rather heavy-handed symbolism, like a gold toilet seat that one personclutches to himself in the middle of the desert, even as he's slowly dying. Here and elsewhere, BengalTiger at the Baghdad Zoo  echoes everything from Waiting For Godot  to Camus to the excellent film
Three Kings.
The cast does its best under the circumstances. Fleischer has some fun when his dim-witted soldier is
suddenly imbued with knowledge and insight (not a great thing, apparently) after dying, getting some
laughs out of his desire to imagine a friendship between himself and Tom on one hand and dashing offArabic and philosophical nuggets on the other. Their best scenes come early -- the opener and a laterscene in a hospital where Tom just wants his gold-plated pistol back and Kev is hurt to realize Tom wasn'treally coming to see how the mentally unraveling Kev is doing. It's a rare moment where characters aresimply allowed to react to one another with normal desires and frustrations, rather than voice vague,existential doubts.
Williams is solid as the tiger, a tricky role that forces him to hold the stage alone and rarely get to play off
another actor the way he did in the acclaimed revival of Waiting For Godot . It's restrained work, by and
large, with any stand-up energy (notably at the beginning of the second act) injected merely to support
the play, not hijack it.
Unlike the stellar work done on Gruesome , this show is not helped by the production. The direction of
Moises Kaufman feels leaden, with long pauses between lines and the entrances and exits handled in a
prosaic manner. The set by Derek McLane feels heavy and unimaginative, with a raised platform juttingout awkwardly on one side to no good effect. A few hints at the beauty of Arabic art and architecture aregood (like the tiled floor and some nice screens) but when we're meant to be in a desert with a blastedlandscape, it's just a dark flat world with a modest crag or two in the distance. It seems to be nowhere
and not a symbolic NOWHERE either.
It's good to see a new artist exploring and striving and pushing boundaries and encouraged at every turn.
