What We Say
Here's a brisk, no-nonsense book on ideas to keep in mind when raising little girls into women. It comes from the acclaimed
writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. It began with a request from a friend asking for advice on how to nurture her new childas a feminist. That turned into a Facebook post which spread like wildfire. Now the tips have been gently expanded into a
