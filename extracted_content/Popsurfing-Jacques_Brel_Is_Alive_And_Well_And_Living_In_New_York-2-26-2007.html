            <p>F R I D AY,  J A N U A RY  2 6 ,  2 0 0 7Jacques Brel Is Alive And Well And Living In NewYorkThe musical "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living In Paris" is oneof those classic shows whose name pops up constantly but which I'venever seen and really don't even know what it's about. (Otherlong-running hits I've always seen mentioned but are similarlymysterious to me include "Abbie's Irish Rose," "Tobacco Road,""Butterflies Are Free" and "Mumenchanz.") But "Jacques Brel" iscurrently revived Off Broadway, where it first debuted in 1968 and ranfor 1,800+ performances. Turns out it's a jukebox musical -- thatcurrently maligned musical genre that celebrates a particularsongwriter or artist. "Jacques Brel" is clearly a precursor to "Ain'tMisbehavin'," another great jukebox musical. But this one was clearlyshadowed by Vietnam since so many of the songs they chose are aboutwar and death. Beyond curiosity, I was drawn by "American Idol's"Constantine Mouralis, who just joined the cast. If I didn't know hishistory, I'm sure I wouldn't have blinked twice about his being in thisfour person cast. He may be the weakest of the four, but he's not toorock n roll. Actually, if anything he's too theater-ish. Constantine wouldbe great in the current revival of "Les Miz." He's also best in the comicmoments and I think he could be very good in the right role. JanePaterson (who played Fantine on Broadway when the original "LesMiz" closed) is lovely and good as the other young presence. Everyoneindeed has their moments, including Robert Cuccioli (of "Jeckyl &Hyde"). But the revelation for me was Gay Marshall, a tiny butextremely French presence who delivered her songs effortlessly. Witheveryone else, I was often aware of their performances -- often happilyso. With Gay, all I ever noticed was the song. It's no surprise she got thestrongest applause of the night. The other star is of course Brel. All inall, a very enjoyable little show.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
