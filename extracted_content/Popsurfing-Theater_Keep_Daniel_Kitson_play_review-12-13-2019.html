THEATER: Two Of Our Best Playwrights Return
To NYC
THE THIN PLACE  ** 1/2 out of ****
PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONS
DANIEL KITSON: KEEP  ** 1/2 out of ****
ST. ANN'S WAREHOUSE
It's the end of the year, the end of the decade and the lists keep coming.
Clearly, I am very aware of what everyone else believes to be the best
shows of the decade, but what did I think? Intrigued or bullied or most
likely just procrastinating before writing a review (not this one!) I
pored over my lists of each and every work of theater I've seen since
2010. Grabbing together all the shows I gave three and a half stars or a
very rare four stars, the result was a good pile of stuff and some happy
memories.
Certain names popped up again and again: PigPen Theater Co., Philip
Glass, Bedlam, Mark Rylance, Harriet Walter, Lucas Knath and Daniel
Kitson. PigPen is a theater company/rock band  poised to find its
biggest audience yet with their new show The Tale of Desperaux.  I
finally saw all three of composer Philip Glass's  "portrait operas" thanks
to remarkable revivals of Satyagraha  in 2011, Einstein On The Beach
in 2012 and -- just under the wire --  Akhnaten  a few weeks ago. Bedlam
created some of the best revivals, pivoted to bold new works and has
now fissioned into two companies one hopes will produce twice as
much heat. Rylance and Walter are obviously two of the best actors
around. And Hnath and Kitson are two of our best playwrights.
Watching Lucas Hnath produce one intriguing, thoughtful, playful
work after another; seeing him smartly create pieces that are
challenging but easy to produce for companies around the country (he's
no fool); marveling as he grew in reputation until his triumphant
Broadway debut with the brilliant, Tony-winning  A Doll's House, Part
2 has been a thrill. This is exactly how it's supposed to work.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -two-of-our -best-playwrights.html 2/7Daniel Kitson  creates and performs his own pieces and would likely
hide at home rather than appear on Broadway. Like Hnath, Kitson has
his own regional support system to try out and refine new pieces. But
his goal is not greater and greater attention. He keeps ticket prices and
production costs low, always, and that gives him the freedom to do
precisely what he wants. The result is a remarkable body of work I
might compare to Spalding Gray or Eric Bogosian but that's wrong. It's
not confessional or personal; it's certainly not stand-up (which Kitson
also does) though I think of him and Eddie Izzard in the same breath.
It's work that is uniquely his own -- funny, piercing, deeply human,
sneakily complex and open-hearted.
Any time Hnath or Kitson come to NYC with a new show, it's an event.
Neither quite sticks the landing in their new piece. But I wouldn't miss
either of them, ever.
First, the Hnath.
Lucas Hnath's new play is stripped down to almost the bare essentials.
The stage is bare and unadorned. The set consists of two chairs with a
small table between them. The cast consists of four actors. But I think it
should have been stripped down even more.
Hnath's plays love to explore public performance from scientific debate
(Isaac's Eye ) to the Sunday sermon ( The Christians ) to a reading ( A
Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of
Walt Disney ). Now with The Thin Place  he tackles one of the oldest
performance genres of all: the ghost story.
Hilda slips onto the stage rather apologetically, carrying a cup of tea.
She sits down and begins to talk. A lonely child, a beloved grandmother
who played games where they tried to read each other's minds and --
when the grandmother dies -- secret seances where the child Hilda tries
to pierce the veil to the other side. She tries and fails to find the thin
place, that rare physical location where this world and the next rub
shoulders.The Movies, Books, Theater,

popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -two-of-our -best-playwrights.html 3/7As an adult, Hilda discovers and becomes fascinated by Linda, a real
psychic with a gift for talking to those who have passed over. Hilda
becomes a devotee and then a disciple and then perhaps a friend of
Linda. And as Hilda tells her story, Linda strides onto the stage, almost
indifferent to Hilda and us. We are beneath her notice or perhaps
merely beside the point. Linda carries the story forward and their
onstage pas de deux is intriguing, a little mystifying and even creepy.
Then Linda carefully makes clear to Hilda that what she does isn't
exactly real. She doesn't say, "I'm a fraud" exactly. But you can't help
sitting up straight and wondering how the gullible and odd Hilda will
react to Linda patiently explain how she does what she does. It's a
genuine service and provides comfort to her clients. But she's not
precisely speaking to the dead so much as telling the living what they
desperately want to hear: you are loved, I forgive you, there is
something more than this life.
And then two more people burst onto the stage. Jerry and Sylvia are
friends of the psychic Linda, which is no surprise since you don't
imagine Hilda has any friends to speak of. Suddenly, all sorts of new
threads are introduced: Linda is working as a consultant for a
politician, Sylvia supports Linda financially and is clearly jealous of
Linda's new friendship (and perhaps romance) with Hilda. Just when
we get a handle on these interlopers, they fade away and we get back to
the purpose at hand, telling a spooky tale.
Despite a few effective bumps in the night, that final story didn't get
under my skin. It's easy to imagine Hnath had a two-hander, got stuck
and decided to give his story a jolt by having two new characters barge
their way in. But a ghost story needs a relentless focus and distractions
are not welcome. Since everything Jerry and Sylvia introduce is beside
the point, it's a shame Hnath didn't disappear them and stick with what
works so well here: the complicated and uncertain relationship
between Linda and Hilda.
I think the technical team and director Les Waters gave Hnath
everything he wanted, though I'd need to return to the show to decide
how I felt about a few abrupt touches. And while it's easy to think Mimi
Lien could hardly go wrong with a bare stage, two chairs and a table,
they feel like exactly the right two chairs and table. Oana Botez's
costumes are also perfectly judged.
As the two interlopers, Triney Sandoval and Kelly McAndrew do what
they can with limited roles and no certain purpose. But Emily Cass
McDonnell is very good as the unobtrusive Hilda, a character that
recedes into the background as much as possible while always making
her presence felt. (After a long stretch of saying nothing, when Hilda
finally speaks up at a party the effect is hilarious.) And Randy Danson
is a treat as the psychic Linda, commanding the stage with aplomb
from start to finish. Her British by way of the Caribbean (?) accent
wavers a bit, but it doesn't matter. I generously took that as adding to
the unreliability of everything Linda says, though the dodgy accent is</p>

popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -two-of-our -best-playwrights.html 4/7not intentional. Danson is wonderful, utterly convincing as she
explains away her psychic gifts one minute and just as passionately
defends them the next. I can't read minds, but just as Hnath worked
again with Laurie Metcalfe I'll bet he'll find another piece to showcase
Danson's talents soon.
And now Kitson. He's a busy man, doing stand-up, hosting benefit
shows with other comics, deejaying on his local radio station for two
weeks every year and traveling the globe doing his "story shows." His
Wikipedia page gives a sense of that prodigious output.  I've sadly never
seen his stand-up and while gladly catching every single work of
theater he's staged in NYC, that still means I haven't seen half of what
he's done. So any guess as to the shape of his career is naturally
blinkered.
The likely mistaken impression I've received is that increasingly
passionate critical raves were a little unsettling to Kitson. Wary of
adulation or simply believing his success was coming too easily, he
turned his Rube Goldberg-like plays into truly dense Borgesian
contraptions. And if god forbid he felt a climax proving too emotional
or touching, Kitson ran in the other direction.
Bollocks. His plays have always been dauntingly complex, despite the
ease with which he pulls them off. And though it briefly seemed Kitson
was trying to make things difficult for himself (one show involved reel-
to-reel machines with pre-recorded bits; it didn't work), he's delivered
the goods before and since. In 2014 (just five years ago), Kitson created
his most open-hearted piece with A Show For Christmas.  And four of
his plays are among my favorites of the 2010s, more than any other
artist.
Keep  won't be on it, but it's often very funny. The stage is bare and
plunged into darkness except for a table and chair and behind that a
filing cabinet with dozens of drawers containing index cards. Kitson
tells us he spent six months cataloguing every single item in his
rambling home. Each item gets one index card. And he's going to read
them off to us, one by one. It will, he assures, have a fascinating
cumulative power but it's not for the faint-hearted. If you want to leave,
by all means do so now and you'll get a full refund. And then he begins.
Problems ensue and with them pleasures. The shape of the show slowly
reveals itself, along with what seem to be digressions and diversions
and casual improvisations. By and large, not a word is wasted since we
realize every offhand comment has a purpose. The audience -- fans one
and all -- are with him every step of the way, laughing at jokes that are
set-up with an aside at one moment and then landed with a quick jab
maybe half an hour later. It demands attention and receives it.
Kitson's plays are often labyrinthian pieces, letting us wander through
his idiosyncratic worldview. But at the heart of the maze is not some
minotaur-like beast, but a willingness to embrace humanity in all its
quirks and failings. They often click into place with a delightful snap at</p>

popsurﬁng.blogspot.com/2019/12/theater -two-of-our -best-playwrights.html 5/7the end, like placing the final piece of a puzzle into place. That doesn't
quite happen here, for some stray details muddy the effect and confuse
the finale. If I sound like the Emperor in Amadeus by declaring Keep
has "too many drawers!" it's not because the show needs to be shorter,
as such. It's because once we know the shape it's taking, filling in the
dots should happen as quickly as possible. I'd spend hours in Kitson's
brain but once we know where we're going the play needs to get there
quicker.
And yet, what a performer. I often think of Kitson the writer and Kitson
the wit. But I don't often think of Kitson the actor. His pieces are
fiendishly elaborate and difficult; Keep  might just be the trickiest of all
to pull off. A lifetime of stand-up, of delivering complex stories with
ease and of winning over an audience to the challenges he's going to set
them allows Kitson to be at his best here. Keep  may not be a keeper,
but Kitson along with Hnath remains on the short list of artists I'd
follow anywhere.
