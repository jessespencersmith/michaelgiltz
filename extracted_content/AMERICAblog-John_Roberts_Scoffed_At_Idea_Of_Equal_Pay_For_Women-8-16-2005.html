8/16/2005 09:37:00 AMThe more papers that get released about Supreme Courtnominee, the farther to the right he appears to be. Why are theDems caving in on this fight? Is he that comfortably within themainstream? Here's USA Today on Roberts and equal pay forwomen -- in short, he compares the idea to communism, whichis about the nastiest thing you could say about something inthe Reagan Administration during the Cold War.As an assistant White House counsel in 1984, John Robertsscoffed at the notion that men and women shouldearn equal pay in jobs of comparable importance, andhe belittled three female Republican members ofCongress who promoted that idea to the Reaganadministration...."I honestly find it troubling that three Republicanrepresentatives are so quick to embrace such a radicalredistributive concept," wrote Roberts in a memo. "Theirslogan may as well be, 'From each according to his ability,to each according to her gender.' "
