3/01/2005 01:52:00 AMThe irony is so thick here, I'm just gonna play it straight. In itsannual roundup of human rights abuses from around the world,the US details the abuses of the interim Iraqi government,which include torture, rape and illegal detentions. Needless tosay, none of these charges include the abuses of the USsoldiers in Iraq, just the Iraqis. (Imagine them sorting it allout: "Hey, Ahmad, did you sodomize that 17 year old kid orwas that me?")Of course, this Congressionally mandated annual report doesn'tdetail the abuses by the US government either here in ourcountry or anywhere else around the world. Obviously, it neveroccurred to anyone that we would ever be part of the probleminstead of part of the solution. Sadly, there is virtuallyNOTHING we detail being done by other countries that the UScannot be justifiably accused of doing on some level as well.Finally, look at the countries who come off as among the worstin this roundup: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, and Jordan.How can you be spreading freedom when your staunchest alliescan't even respect basic human rights in their own countries?And of course the countries that aren't responsible for a catalogof sins are the very allies who have distanced themselves fromus: Canada, France, Germany, the Scandinavian countries,Japan and the people of Great Britain, to name a few. Sad.
