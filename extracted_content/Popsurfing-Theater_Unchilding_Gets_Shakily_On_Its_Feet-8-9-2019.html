THEATER: "Unchilding" Gets Shakily On Its Feet
UNCHILDING  ** out of ****
DIMENNA  CENTER  FOR  CLASSICAL  MUSIC  
The world premiere of Unchilding  presented a piece that is clearly a
work in progress from a director striving to find a unique voice...or at
least one that suits this particular project. It's downtown in every senseof the word and you'd normally expect to stumble across it at LaMama (which gets a thanks in the credits) or in a raw loft spacesurrounded by hipsters where someone hands you a leaflet with
credits run off by a pal at Kinkos who did it for free.
Instead it's staged at the handsome Dimenna Center with a cast of 26
onstage (more provide voice work for pre-recorded dialogue), a very
classy booklet complete with cast photos and the entire night
thoroughly documented (two or three cameras filmed the performancewhile still photographers discreetly took pictures of the audience).Director/creator Joshua Kaufman is either independently wealthy orhas a gift that major talents often have for getting others on board with
their vision. It was all a little head-spinning and discombobulating,
from the multi-media tech work (all exquisite, which means theymeant  to have a bright light blaring down on us from behind until the
performance began) to the is-it-over finale that left the audienceuncertain if it was really done even after they clapped.
None of this matters, but it provides the context for what was an
interesting, uncertain 50 minute performance piece. It uses one-actplays by John Walter Howley as the building blocks for Kaufman'sshow. Basically, Kaufman recorded dialogue from these plays (they
may be performed in full, but I don't think so). That provides a
soundtrack for the action on stage. In dim light, other actors (not theones who recorded the dialogue) come onto a bare setting of woodenplatforms and stage tableaus, each of them essentially frozen into placeMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>and staring off with focused intent. Once they are in position, the
soundtrack begins to play and the story starts.
So while we're hearing two short plays presented almost as radio
dramas, we watch people onstage embodying those characters without
moving or emoting much if at all. The first story involves soldiers
trapped in a building and cut off from their main company. The secondstory involves a sister and brother struggling to get by in a fishingtown when a rough but well-intentioned local man asks the sister tomarry him. I'm not sure why these particular plays needed this
particular presentation (which is unconventional if not unheard of).
While it didn't pay any particular dividends but it didn't not  work.

A few thoughts occur. The setting of the first story was less clear to usand the audio mix of the dialogue and action dropped the ball a little.
When a soldier goes upstairs to keep watch, we were a bit adrift. Are
they in a cellar? On   the first floor, with the lookout on the second?
When gunfire erupts, it took a minute to be told what had happened,which was far from what we imagined   based on the soundscape. And
the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. No such problem of settingarises in the second story, which takes place in a shack by the water.The sound of water and perhaps a seagull and we're there. The storywas also stronger, thanks to a clearer conflict and climax.
Kaufman's presentation of the two dozen+ actors should be bolder and
more frequent. His soldiers were poised in a useful tension at first.
And the new recruit rising up unexpectedly (and nervously) frombeneath the wooden platforms was probably the best flourish of thenight. Similarly, a wordless scene was staged between the two playlets.
It didn't precisely have anything to do with what came before or after
but it was memorable. More of that was needed to flesh out what the
audience actually watched. Instead, we had a staging and a visualShakily On Its Feet

<p>presentation that was straightforward but not always arresting. Having
a group of townspeople with their backs to the audience and then
turning to face us/the characters at a key moment of guilt in the
second story was far too nail-on-the-head. It didn't help that thisobvious choice was also the biggest, hardest to miss moment of thenight.
What really didn't work was Kaufman's interest in the grotesque. The
fisherman who comes a -courting in the second tale? He's wearing avery effective bit of makeup/mask that makes him appear to have sixeyes, like some mythological creature from The Odyssey. It certainly
looked striking, but after the initial impact you spend most of the
scene half-listening to the story and half-wondering why preciselyKaufman decided the mask was a good or interesting idea. It doesn'tneed to make sense or be explained, exactly, but it didn't registereffectively on a subconscious level either. (The other grotesque touchperhaps did, but it too felt too obvious and too much.)
While the evening was appropriately about 50 minutes long, the
simple fact is that an evening of just two vignettes simply doesn'twork. You need at least three vignettes...or the two vignettes need tobe more specific and strong tales, more like two one acts than what wehad. That and adding some more of the unexplained but effective
tableau that separated the two stories would give this work a shape
and purpose and form it lacks now.
Nonetheless, Kaufman marshaled dozens of people and impressive
resources for this piece.
He and his casting associates found a strong group of actors whobrought presence to the stage, especially Michael James Fry as a crustysoldier, Hannah Crane (I believe) as Laura (the sister being proposed
to) and whichever actor embodied the raw recruit in the first story.
(The actors who played specific roles on stage are not ID'd as such.)Indeed, the actress playing Laura added immeasurably to theemotional impact of the second piece with nothing at her disposal buther eyes and her intensity.
The hardest part of creating art that needs a team effort like
theater/performance is just making the damn thing happen,convincing others with talent you have a vision and that they are goingto want to be part of making that vision happen. At that, Kaufmannmost certainly succeeded.
