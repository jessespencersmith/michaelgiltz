5/02/2005 03:02:00 PMThis is really outrageous. According to the NYT, ABC is runningan ad from hate group Focus on the Family during the seasonfinale Monday of the hit primetime show Supernanny. This afterCBS and NBC refused to run an ad from the United Church ofChrist because it dared to be welcoming of gays.Focus on the Family is a hate group and has a history of lyingand distorting facts when speaking to the media. Any org thatwanted to focus on them and challenge their lies in majorstories could have made this group untouchable for anyrespectable media outlet years ago. Ditto the Traditional ValuesCoalition et al. But they're considered repsectable enough torun ads on major networks but a Christian church is not?Thanks to ohthebill for alerting us to this story.
