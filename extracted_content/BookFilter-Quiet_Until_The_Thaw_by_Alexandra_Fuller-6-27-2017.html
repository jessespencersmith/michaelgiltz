What We Say
Writer Alexandra Fuller is an expert in cultural appropriation, intentional and not. She was raised in Rhodesia (now
Zimbabwe) and her childhood was dominated by violence and drinking and the constant battle to hold onto "their" land, aword in quotes that Fuller explored brilliantly in her debut memoir "Don't Let's Go To The Dogs Tonight." Her parents and a
lover inspired several more memoirs; now Fuller has embraced fiction with "Quiet Until The Thaw." Fuller is a white woman
born in England and growing up in Africa, but says she felt a sense of coming home, of kinship among the Lakota OglalaSioux Nation peoples of South Dakota. Saying, in essence, yeah, she doesn't really care if you don't think this is "her" storyShare This Book

<p>to tell. She weaves a tale spanning generations and wars, from Vietnam to Desert Storm; a story of cousins who respond to
the unceasing burden of life in very different ways; a myth of beginnings and ends and beginning again. Fuller gets deep
under the skin of the world view of the Lakota, never ennobling them in some awful patronizing way but honoring them by
telling this particular, unvarnished story of prison and murder and babies born in a storm and strong women and indifferentWhite People and sadness and...not joy exactly but endurance. Lakota language and Lakota myth are woven throughout,along with a black-humored streak. It's funny and distinctive and utterly unlike anything Fuller has done before except likeher best work, it too feels risky and alive. -- Michael Giltz
