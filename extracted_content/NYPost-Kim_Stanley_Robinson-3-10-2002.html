It is lvidely considered

Director Jarnes C:urerort
considered uralting it his

But Robinson rnay reacirhis rvitlest audience yet

tbanks to an ingenious
plot device.

dreaded the thought of in-
iroduciDg a character and

then their childrer just to
give it sone cortinuity.
His solutior was to em-
brace the concept of reir-
carnation: The novel fol-
lows three souls that keep
reincariatirg ancl crossing

actcrs that chrnge aud
grow over tirne, but also a
Scheherazadelike llow of

Robinson dips into his-
tory evety 50 years or so
with his characters, por-
trafing everyoue from a
warrior who stumbles
upori a village decimated
by the piague in the 1400s,
to an alchcndst *,ho never

Robinson called on Is-
luuric contacts he made for
the "N4ars Trilogy," u.hicli
invoh'ed a tnajor Islulic
subplot, to get "Rice anJ
Salt" right.
