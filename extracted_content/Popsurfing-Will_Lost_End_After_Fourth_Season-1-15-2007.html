            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 7Will "Lost" End After Fourth Season?The creators behind "Lost" realize the show is floundering -- not thatthey'll admit it. They're talking with ABC about when to end the show.And just as everyone from Popsurfing to Stephen King has said, theyneed to choose an end date -- the sooner the better -- so they show canbuild towards a finale. If they try to stretch it to five seasons, they'reignoring reality. This show should have been a season-long telenovelaor a two year blast each January without repeats and with a clearend-goal in sight. A high concept show like this can't be teased outendlessly. Networks have to start thinking more like the British: someTV shows aren't meant to run eight years. Some are miniseries, somecan last two seasons, some three and so on. Stop thinking every showmust be a mainstay of your schedule for a decade to come.UPDATE: By the way, ABC also admits that airing six episodes of"Lost" and then taking off a few months was idiotic. Next season, they'llpull a "24" and air all the episodes in a row without repeats, either inthe fall or spring. Given the miserable ratings for most shows as reruns,this will have to become standard practice for ALL TV shows soonerthan they expect. People will NOT watch repeats any more, not withhundreds of channels, digital downloads, free access to their favoriteson network websites and DVD box sets at their beck and call. Also, itseems like the producers are going to announce an ending after fiveseasons. Big deal, with the ever-expanding cast and ever-shrinkingratings, it probably would have been cancelled by then anyway.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
