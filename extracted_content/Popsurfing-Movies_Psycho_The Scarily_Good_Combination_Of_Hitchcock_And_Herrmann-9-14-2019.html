MOVIES: The Scarily Good Combination Of
Hitchcock and Herrmann on "Psycho"
THE  ART  OF  THE  SCORE:  NEW  YORK  PHILHARMONIC
PSYCHO (1960) **** out of ****
I love film scores and movie music. My first story in a national
publication was about jazz-inspired film scores  that ran in Premiere
magazine. I reviewed film scores and soundtracks for the now-defunctCD Review, including this comprehensive round-up of Oscar-winningsoundtracks . Heck, I used that clip to pitch an entire book -- a sort of
Rolling Stone Record Guide devoted solely to soundtracks. Who better
than me to write about everything from Max Steiner's ground-
breaking score for 1933's King  Kong  to the pop songs on Footloose ? It
wasn't meant to be, but my passion for movie music remains. I'velistened to soundtracks. I've watched movies intently with the scoreand use of music uppermost in my mind. And I've screened films with
just the audio track featuring music turned up while everything else is
turned off, so I can see the images of the film and hear only the music.
Guess what? None of that is as illuminating and fun as watching a
movie projected on a big screen while the New York Philharmonic
performs the score. You're watching and enjoying the film, but because
the music is being performed live it is always uppermost in your mind.For seven seasons, The Art Of The Score has proven this again andagain. You notice music cues more acutely, you appreciate when thescore is NOT underlining a scene and you always get to hear the music
in context. Listening to a score on its own can be a treat. Performing a
score orchestrated into a symphonic piece can be enlightening. Butnothing beats hearing a score with the movie it was composed for.
That proved the case with Close  Encounters  Of  The  Third  Kind  this
week.  It's the most austere and unsettling of scores by John Williams.
And the famous, instantly recognizable five note cue that is the heart
of the climactic scene isn't just a string of notes played over and over.
It's a full orchestral conversation bursting with humanity and humor,MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

SHOWBIZ SANDBOX #463:
Why Is A TV Special</p>
<p>both human and otherwise.
I may never recover from missing their performance of Amadeus  last
season, an audacious and challenging enterprise to be sure. If you can,
catch Psycho  on Saturday September 14 at Lincoln Center. Or book
now for the Christmas treat of Harry  Potter  and  the  Sorceror's  Stone
December 11-14,  another John Williams score and an event sure to
challenge Star  Wars  for the number of audience members showing up
in costume (or at least wand in hand). Even better, the Spring Gala onMay 20 will feature Singin'  In  The  Rain.  That's followed immediately
by Mary  Poppins  from May 21-23, which I scandalously consider a
better musical (yes) and the peak work of the Sherman Brothers.Seeing that in concert will surely prove how much terrific music is inthat classic even when songs aren't being sung. (Follow the links tobuy tickets.)
But first, we have Psycho.  Alec Baldwin introduced the film with an
amusing story about a father who wrote to director Alfred Hitchcock.
His daughter saw 1955's Diabolique  and was so freaked out by a
bathtub scene that she insisted on taking only showers. Of course,then she saw Psycho  and refused to take a shower either. Hitchcock
wrote back: "Send her to the dry cleaners." Conductor RichardKaufman cheekily pointed out this performance was taking place on
Friday the 13th, (cheers and laughter from the audience), it was a full
moon (more applause and laughter) and now they were all about towatch Psycho . Hitch would have approved.
Here's a six minute short featuring the droll Mr. Hitchcock (self)promoting his new movie Psycho .
Psycho  is a low-budget, black and white flick shot down and dirty in
30 days with a crew used to working fast and cheap for TV. Since itfollowed Hitchcock's lavish color spectacle North  By  Northwest,  critics
were thrown for a loop. But audiences loved it all over the world,making Psycho  the biggest hit of his career. Now recognized as a
masterpiece, it may not have been the first of its kind, but it surelyCelebrat...

<p>inspired countless lesser slasher flicks and an obsession with serial
killers. The performances by Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam and
especially Anthony Perkins are so good it's remarkable to read thatHitchcock watched a rough cut and thought the film was a failure. Heconsidered cutting it down to one hour for his TV show AlfredHitchcock  Presents  and writing off this experiment as a loss.
Composer Bernard Herrmann insisted on at least writing the music.Needless to say, after seeing the film with a score, Hitchcock changedhis mind about how well the movie worked. If even a master like
Hitchcock (who famously mapped out his movies before he shot a
single frame) can reappraise a film dramatically like that, then youknow just how powerful a score can be.
Of course, you're waiting for the shower scene, but the entire evening
is a treat. Herrmann was on a tight budget and made do with a smallerorchestra composed only of strings. And as so often happens whenartists face limitations, they use those restrictions to inspire creativity.The strings snap like percussion, they swoon like woodwinds, they waillike horns, they dance. Whenever someone is walking up the stairs of
the Bates home, the music darts and dives around their feet (and even
more so if the character is soon falling back down).
When Norman Bates (Perkins) and Marion Crane (Leigh) are chatting
over a late night snack, the music is notably absent. Their talk is
musing, confiding, even charming. And then Marion wonders ifNorman might just put his seemingly abusive mother...somewhere.Norman leans forward, filling the screen (Hitchcock frames it so thisseems very menacing) and Herrmann's music steps in and suddenlyyou feel very, very uncomfortable and perhaps this is the unconsciousmoment he decides to kill her. Put his mother in a madhouse? Never.
"What do you know about caring?" asks Norman and all one can think
is, "Run!"
A few scenes later, Norman is chatting with a private investigator and
leans over as the man is checking out the hotel registry. The camera
catches Norman at the strangest angle, sitting just under his chin andneck as Norman chews on some candy and chats away. You might notthink about it or even clock how odd a choice it is at the time.   But the
idea that Norman is simply not like other boys -- might be more
creature than human, chomping away with unthinking abandon -- is
all in that shot. No music is playing, but I was conscious of the choicenot to include it here and how that allows this subtly effective moment
to inform the audience without calling attention to itself. (You can't
help note when music isn't used because dozens of people are on stage
but not playing. Indeed, when the conductor stands up, you are doublyaware a new musical cue is about to begin. It's just one more reasonthese performances are so valuable for appreciating a film's score.)
Yes, even when the score isn't playing, composer and "conductor" (ok,
director) are working in tandem. And of course the scenes where they</p>
<p>are both present strike you all the more. Whether it's the shower scene
with the brief glimpses of a bare stomach and the squealing,
frightening violins or the scenes of Marion driving down the highway
to the rushed, anxious feeling that the law (or a guilty conscience) isdogging her every move or the finality of the last burst of music in thelast shot of the movie as a submerged coffin of a car is dredged upfrom a swamp, you appreciate two masters perfectly in sync.
