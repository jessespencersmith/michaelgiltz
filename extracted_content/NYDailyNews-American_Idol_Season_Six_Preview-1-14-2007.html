Pop star hopefuls, to the starting line! ByMrcHAELcrr,rz
ill it happen all oveh again? Will America fall
in love one more time with "American ldol"
in its sixth season, beginning Tuesday? WilI
viewers phone or text in more than half a
billion votes to support their favorite acts,
like they did last year? Will there be contro-
versy and tears? Will there be great perfor-
mances and unexpected failures? Will someone get booted
before his or her time? Will thd winner deliver a multi-
platinum album and will the runners-up enJoy success as
well? Will around 30 million viewers tune in everv week?
What doyou think?
"American Idol" launches Tuesday '
(Fox, 8 p.m.) with auditions from Min-
neapolis; Seattle auditions follow on
Ubdnesday. Every year, people assume
the show can't get any bigger. And every
yeat rt does
But even if this is the vear "ldol" ma-nia finally peaks, it's clearly gone from
a phenomenon to an institution that will
remain wildly influential foryears to
come
"American Idol" didn't invent the tal-
ent show Itjust perfected it
The three judges - Paula, Randy andSimon - have become first-name-only
celebrities Host Ryan Seacrest looks set
to become the next Dick Clark (he's al-
ready got New Year's Eve sem up) And
"Idol's" method of picking stars md
making them famous is spreading from
pop music to theater, books and every
other facet of entertainment- (Given the
show's track record in spotting genuine
talent, if "Idol" could pick the next presi-
dent of the United States, it might be eas-
ier than an election )
The wimers - and many of the oth-
er flnalists - have gone on to multiplat-
inum careers in pop, country R&B, gos-
pel and dance They've won Grammys
and hit Broadway. They've made
indie films and huge hit musicals.
They've signed deals to star in sitcoms
and worked as reporters on entertain-
ment news shows Very soon, they might
even produce their first Oscar-winner
with "Dreamgirls"' star-is-born sensation
Jennifel Hudson.
Every season brings changes that
tweak and imorove the shos and thenew one will be no exception. Producers
plan an "Idol"-like songwriting contest
to choose the tunes the singers pertom
at the frnals and which the winner will
release as their first (and undoubted-
lyNo l) single The "Holllryood" shows
- the episodes after the auditions but
before finalists start getting winnowed
down in live votes - have been short-
ened as much as possibl.e
They're also cooking up a "huge"
midseason surprise. Along the way,
superstars ranging from the likes of '
Rod Stewart and Barry Manilow to
Prince and MaryJ. Blige will coach
and perform solo and alongside the
contestants
And perhaps the most remarkable fact
of all? No one knows who the star of the
show will be. Everyone is an unknown,
eager hopefuls from small towns md
big cities who sing in the shower or on
some stage somwhere night after night,
dreaming of stardom. For some of them,
that dream is about to come true Here
are the five who got there first
