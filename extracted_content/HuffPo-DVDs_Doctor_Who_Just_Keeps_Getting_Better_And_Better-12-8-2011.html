 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: "Doctor Who" Just Keeps
Getting Better And Better
DOCTOR WHO: THE COMPLETE SIXTH SERIES  ($89.98 BluRay or $79.98 DVD;
BBC/2Entertain) -- I'm almost scandalized at how quickly I've come to accept Matt Smith as the Doctor,
when I was sure David Tennant would overshadow others for years to come. This is another very strongseason for the show, with Neil Gaiman penning one of the best episodes, "The Doctor's Wife" and theChristmas episode spin on Dickens especially good. The 14 episodes contain an overarching storylinefeaturing Alex Kingston as a fellow time traveller. The only pity about seeing Kingston here is that itprecludes her from being the first female Doctor, which is long overdue and for which she proves herselfeminently capable. (Perhaps Emma Thompson, though of course the Doctor is rarely cast with a bigname.) I hope they commit to some really universe-shaking storyline and do an entire season as one longMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>adventure, a la the "Children Of Earth" miniseries for Torchwood, a high-water mark in quality for the
entire Who universe. Still, this is great fun. I'm sure they'll much up the proposed feature film; I mean
how long can they go without stumbling?
THREE COLORS: BLUE, WHITE, RED  ($79.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- I meet with a dozen or so
people every year to vote on our favorite movies. ( The IRAs. ) Once a decade we vote on the best movies
of all time so we've been going back and forth for months on what movies we're watching and re-
watching. Any serious movie lover won't be surprised to know that director Krzystof Kieslowski keepscoming up. Some are watching The Dekalogue  for the first time (while others argue it's a TV miniseries,
even if it did play in theaters here in the US). Others appreciate The Double Life Of Veronique.  But
everyone is determined to watch or rewatch Three Colors , a trilogy of films and one of the landmark
works of cinema. Each film stands alone but they're richer when watched together (one a night, or eventake a night off between them). White is the awkward middle child, but Blue  and Red  are simply
sensational. Deeply moving, philosophical and on a very basic level just simply gorgeous to look at, thesemovies have never looked better than in this Criterion edition. Those with earlier DVD versions maywant to hold on to them for some of the extras. This set contains many of them and new ones, along witha substantial booklet. But the movies -- dealing with pain and death and love and the cross currents of
coincidence and fate that bind us all together -- are overwhelming. I actually don't like the cover art
(usually Criterion finds just the right visual approach for its titles) but that's a very minor point in what isimmediately one of the most important and satisfying releases of the year.
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS  ($40.99 BluRay or $30.99 DVD; Sony) -- It's wonderful to see a young
up-and-comer like Justin Timberlake getting some on the job training from Hollywood. Seriously,though, Timberlake is improving with each movie and show genuine chemistry with Mila Kunis in thisfamiliar but not bad story about two friends who decide to fool around -- but they won't fall in love.Promise! This is how Hollywood used to work, with young starlets like Timberlake put in a dozen or somovies a year while they figured out what he (or she) was good at. Or dumped them, of course, but Ithink Timberlake is a keeper. Maybe a musical? Someone call MGM.

<p>CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS  ($34.98 BluRay 3-D combo or $27.98 DVD; MPI/Sundance) -- On
repeated viewings, Werner Herzog's rambling documentary about the cave paintings in France reveals
the diversions at the end when he starts ruminating about albino alligators or some such thing are ashame for an otherwise magical film. I can't watch it in 3-D though if you have a 3-D compatible TV anda 3-D compatible BluRay player of some sort and the right glasses, you can and should and let the rest ofus know what it's like. Seeing the film for the first time in 2-D, it remains a wonder, almost like going tochurch the feeling is so hallowed (and the choral music only reinforces that). Herzog gazes quietly at cavedrawings created tens and tens of thousands of years ago, drawings the general public can't get access toin order to preserve them, and it's a rare treat. One of the best films of the year and quite gorgeouslooking.
THE RULES OF THE GAME  ($29.95 DVD; Criterion) -- 1939 is widely considered the greatest year in
Hollywood history and, for me, The Rules Of The Game  is the greatest film of the year. Of course, when
you hear a movie is one of the Great Films, you might brace yourself for some serious, heavy, slow-moving contemplation of the universe. But what you get in director Jean Renoir's masterpiece is adelightful comedy of manners about the upper crust on a weekend in the country with everyone hoppinginto each other's beds when they're not making fun of one another. It's no less deeply moving andinsightful for being so light on its feet. This is one classic you can savor easily. Criterion's new edition isbeautifully remastered, with loads of useful extras like a TV documentary and TV interviews with Renoirover the years among a bounty of other features. Quite the treat.

<p>CONAN THE BARBARIAN  ($39.99 3-D BluRay combo or $29.95 DVD; Lionsgate) -- Fans of the
Robert E. Howard stories decried the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for their comic tone and liberties
with the source material. Now with this new version starring Jason Momoa so stunningly witless and
video game-ish in its telling that they must be weeping over the lost glory days of Arnold. I will say that
Leo Howard shows some sparks in the brief section devoted to young Conan but it's about the only point
of interest in this mindless, noisy, boring rendition that sucks the pulp out of Conan and leaves only a dry
husk. I did not like it, in case you were wondering.
THE FUTURE  ($27.98; Lionsgate) -- Actor Hamish Linklater is having a very fun year. He's starring on
Broadway in the comedy Seminar with Alan Rickman, he was positively delightful in the Off Broadwayshow The School For Lies and he co-stars in the second film from the distinctively oddball director,writer and star Miranda July. However much you cotton to July's offbeat perspective in this story of acouple overwhelmed by the prospect of adopting a cat, you simply have to see her film if you want to talkintelligently about the year in cinema. Her audio commentary is a must for getting to know July better;pity Hamish wasn't on there with her.
MAKING THE BOYS  ($27.95; First Run Features) -- It's ironic but true that watching this
documentary about the making of the landmark gay play and film The Boys In The Band may be a morelasting creative accomplishment than the play itself. The Boys In The Band has gone from shocker tocamp to some unusual spot in between, but this film about that show features playwright Mart Crowley,the surviving cast members and many people who can attest to the impact the show had, people likeEdward Albee, Tony Kushner, Dominick Dunne and the like. A model of its sort with some nice extras toboot featuring Dan Savage and Dunne.</p>
<p>THE OFFICE SPECIAL EDITION 10TH ANNIVERSARY  ($39.98; BBC/2Entertain) --
Unquestionably the most influential and funniest sitcom of the 2000s, The Office just looks better and
better with repeated viewings. If you're never seen it, don't bother renting or streaming or buying season
one -- just get the whole darn thing right here. You're gonna want to own it and watch it again and again.
The only advantage to not owning it is that you won't be tempted to pop it in every few weeks. Twelve
pitch-perfect episodes that equal Fawlty Towers in their unfaltering quality, this set also contains thefinale Christmas special that weakens a bit on the central premise. I strongly suggest you wait quite awhile before watching that one after the end of the show proper. Ricky Gervais has gone on to do othervery fun work, but this will be on his tombstone and who would complain about that. Martin Freeman,Mackenzie Crook, Lucy Davis -- what great casting! New extras include testimonials from Ben Stiller,Hugh Jackman and the like along with a new documentary. Essential.
ONE DAY  ($29.98 DVD; Focus) -- Speaking of the Brits, they've had quite enough thank you very much
of American actresses coming along and snagging some of the most sought after roles in UK movies. FirstRenee Zellwegger created outrage when she was cast in the iconic role of Bridget Jones; luckily heraccent and performance quieted them down. Anne Hathaway has had less luck, convincing few that shewas Jane Austen and now as working girl Emma in this rmiddling omance based on the best-sellingnovel by David NIcholls. The movie wouldn't have been better with a local girl, but the Brits are notamused. Well fine, but does that mean Hugh Laurie will stop playing House?
THE BIRTH OF A NATION DELUXE 3-DISC EDITION  ($29.95; Kino) -- D.W. Griffith's epic is a</p>
<p>technical marvel that pioneered numerous techniques and remains a landmark work. But it's important
to watch this film and remember it because of its virulent racism and reworking of history, not despite it.Watch the movie's vicious portrayals of blacks and you'll never watch Gone With The Wind  in the same
way again. See its absurd story of Yankee and Southerner coming together and damning the Negro forever coming between them, marvel as the KKK plays a key heroic role, note that it was praised (praised!)by President Woodrow Wilson as it became a box office sensation and you'll gain an entirely newperspective on race relations and our nation's history since the Civil War ended. This set includes twoversions of the film two different scores, a clutch of Griffith shorts centered around the War Between TheStates, a look at the battle over the film when it was reissued in 1922 and much more.
LE CIRQUE: A TABLE IN HEAVEN  ($24.95; First Run Features) -- As with director Andrew Rossi's
Page One,  an interesting subject overcomes the more rudimentary aspects of the film. Here Rossi takes a
look at the famed restaurant Le Cirque as it makes a wrenching transition. Sirio Maccioni and his threesons close down one location and then work towards a new opening and that crucial first review as theytry and deal with the many changes in the industry. The movie showcases the family but of coursecelebrities like Woody Allen also pop in. Zagat's might say affordable and reasonable fare.
DIXIE CHICKS STORYTELLERS  ($14.98; Columbia) -- This 80 minute set from 2006 captures the
Dixie Chicks reveling in their commercial and critical comeback Taking The Long Way,  the Grammy
winner for Album Of The Year. Here we get just eleven songs leavened with the stories from the womenin the band about how and why the songs were written and recorded. It's fun for fans but the strongestreaction you have after watching it is how missed the Dixie Chicks are in the music world. Six years is toolong to wait. Till then, this release will have to do for fans looking for something, anything they can buyfrom the group. It's good. A new album would be better.</p>
<p>THREE AMIGOS!  ($14.98; HBO) -- I am deaf to the pleasures of this super-silly comedy about a silent
film comedy act unintentionally hired by a Mexican village plagued by bandits a la The Magnificent
Seven.  Still, I have friends who swear by it and certainly Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short
seem to be having fun, even on the audio commentary.
THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE  ($19.99 MGM) -- Forget the recent remake. This
trim thriller starring Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw in the story of a gang that hijacks a subway car is
great fun, especially for its look at New York City in 1974. Director Joseph Sargent never parlayed itssuccess into a feature film career, but he's delivered one strong TV movie after another for decades, right
up to Warm Springs  and Something The Lord Made  in his eighties.
THE BIG COUNTRY  ($19.99; MGM) -- I prefer my Westerns sleek and simple but this William Wyler
film is 166 minutes of the big lumbering sort with Gregory Peck a man who prefers the sea but finds
himself in a range war.The smaller touches are what endure, especially Burl Ives as a vicious rancher (hewon the Oscar) and the marvelous score by Jerome Moross.</p>

SABU!  ($44.95; Eclipse/Criterion) -- Sabu was surely one of the unlikeliest of movie stars. He was
discovered by documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty and immediately had the movie Elephant Boy
created as a vehicle for him. It became a massive worldwide success and other movies followed, especially
The Drum  and Jungle Book.  Those are his three best movies, along with The Thief Of Baghad  (not
included here). Sabu had genuine presence and humor and sex appeal (Sabu rarely bothered with wearinga shirt) but Hollywood had no idea what to do with him. Sabu emigrated to the US, became a citizen,served honorably during WW II and then watched his career slide into miserable B movies andembarrassments until he died unexpectedly at the age of 39. But here is a fine recap of why he was sopopular: three of his best films in one compact package. Elephant Boy  and Jungle Book  look good with
The Drum  clearly in need of restoration but good to have in any form.

Lot of good stuff there Michael. "Red, Whire and Blue" are great. And "Doctor Who?" what can you
say? Matt Smith was good. Perfectly quirky. I forget the name of his sidekick, but she waswonderful too. Along with "Torchwood," great year.I used to play in a band who did gigs with Sabu's son (the name of his band was Sabu). Sabu must
died right after he had him. Didn't know it was so young. 
And that "Big Country" score is one of the best. I watch it often, mainly for Ives and Jean Simmons.
thanks for letting us now about these releases.
