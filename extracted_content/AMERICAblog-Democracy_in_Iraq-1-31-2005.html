1/31/2005 10:42:00 AMBob Herbert of the New York Times nods politely towards myopinion that the voting yesterday was a heartening, evenhistoric moment. Then he embraces the opinions of most ofthis blog's readers and details the many ways in which Iraq isstill a disaster getting worse and far, far from a democracy aswe understand it. That right-wing bastion the editorial board ofthe New York Times also weighs in, acknowledging the heavywork ahead and massive obstacles to success but leaning moretowards my positive spin. And while Bush and his people thumptheir chests and crow about the elections, let's remember thatthey initially wanted to put off elections far into the future butit was an Iraqi figure -- Grand Ayatollah Sistani -- who insistedthey be held as soon as possible. Bush embraced that becausehe had no choice.
