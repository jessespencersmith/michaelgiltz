            <p>NYP TV WEEK 
• REALLY BIG SHOW 
'Survivor' on 5th Ave. 
By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
REAUTY-TV contestants who 
thought immunity challenges, bug­
eating and Jeff Probst were as bad 
as the genre gets will face the toughest 
challenge of all in NBC's "The Appren­
tice": The Donald. 
Yes, Donald Trump is back. The real­
estate tycoon of the 'SOs, who wrote best­
selling books ("The Art of the Deal"), was 
satirized in "Doonesbury," went deep into 
debt but left his mark on the New York 
skyline, is on top again. Business is boom­
ing and, now, he's the star of the latest re­
ality show from "Survivor" mastermind 
Mark Burnett. 
Getting Trump to do TV at all took 
some convincing. "All of the networks 
have wanted me to do a reality show," he 
says. "Most of the shows [wantedl cam­
eras following me around; nothing I was 
interested in. I'm the largest developer in 
the city - I don't have time [for thatl 
Nor do the people I deal with want to 
have a camera stuck in their face. I turned 
[the networksl all down. 
"But a year ago, [executive producerl 
Mark Burnett approached me with this 
idea of the jungle of New York. The Ap­
prentice' is a very, very tough show. They 
had 215,000 people [download applica­
tions to take partl. Of course, a lot of peo­
ple would rather be in New York than in 
Panama (location of the most recent "Sur­
vivor"). They chose 16 people and they're 
really brilliant." 
Following the proven "Survivor" for­
mula, "The Apprentice" pits two teams of 
eight contestants against each other. But 
the Trump show, which debuts this 
Thursday and moves to its regular 8 p.m. 
time slot on Wednesday, January 14th, 
has it all over "Survivor" when it comes 
to creature comforts. Rather than starv­
ing in a hut in some Godforsak en, far­
flung locale, the players on "The Appren­
tice," live in a midtown Manhattan loft so 
fabulous that it's sure to arouse the envy 
of any "Real World" resident. 
The show's format is deceptively sim­
ple. Each week, Trump gives contestants, 
who range from MBAs to self-made en­
trepreneurs, a new assignment. Their 
first is one almost everyone can identify 
with -running a lemonade stand. But 
not everyone on "The Apprentice" can 
hack it, apparently. The failing team re­
ports to Trump's boardroom, where The 
Donald fires one of them on the spot. 
Despite the absence of immunity chal­
lenges and other tests of athletic prowess 
that are the hallmarks of "Survivor," Bur­
nett says that in some ways "The Appren­
tice" is even more physically challenging 
than the all-time reality-TV champ. The 
contestants, he says, get almost no sleep. 
And he emphasizes the wildly different 
jobs they have to tackle each week. 
"None of this show takes place in an of­
fice building," says Burnett. "Week to 
week, [the contesantsl are being given 
tasks [such asl operating a flea market, 
which means getting seed money and 
[figuring outl what the hell are you going 
to sell, to [asking yoursel(J how do I get 
space at a flea market and how do I make Donald Trump will 
teach 16 eager 
contestants the 
tricks ofthe 
tycoon trade on 
"The Apprentice ';' 
money? They'll also be asked to come up 
with a celebrity charity auction, produce 
a golf event and find real estate in a very 
rundown neighborhood, renovate and 
rent it above the market rate in 48 hours." 
The winner of "The Apprentice" will be 
awarded a one-year, $250,000 contract to 
work for Trump. 
While the contestants stand the most to 
gain on this show, Trump himself has 
nothing to lose, even though many reality 
shows ("Newlyweds," "The Osbournes") 
reveal their stars to be train wrecks wait­
ing to happen. He's not worried about the 
series tarnishing his image. "Mark never 
said I was going to come across well 
[necessarilyl," says Tnllnp. "I'm me. And 
you know me and people know me. There 
are certain instances where perhaps I 
won't look good. Who knows? I don't re­
ally care." 
So far, Trump says he's been impressed 
with the contestants, but admits that most people simply don't have what it 
takes to be a major entrepreneur. 
"Most people don't have the skill," says 
Trump, who employs some 20,000 work­
ers. "They're not born with it. Just like 
people don't have the skill of Jack Nick­
laus to hit a golf ball or Babe Ruth to hit a 
baseball. Innate talent is a very important 
ingredient. You can get better at some­
thing, but having good genes is not the 
worst thing that can happen to a person." 
Trump has always excelled at being the 
center of attention and fully expects "The 
Apprentice" to be just as successful as his 
latest real-estate development project on 
the Upper West Side. 
"I always like success," he says. "I think 
[the show isl so good and hey, we've got 
the best network and the best producer. 
And they have me."
