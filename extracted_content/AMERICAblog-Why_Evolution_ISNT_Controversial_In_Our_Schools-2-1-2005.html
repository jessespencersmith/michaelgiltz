2/01/2005 01:11:00 AMSadly, it's not because most Americans understand the sciencebehind it. Evolution ain't controversial at the local levelBECAUSE IT JUST ISN'T TAUGHT.Yep, teachers all over the country simply avoid the topic. TheNYT details how it's impossible to determine how widespreadthe practice, but anecdotally it's very common. Even ifevolution is in the textbooks and there is no goofy disclaimerthat it's "just a theory" (which in scientific terms of coursemeans an idea that is widely accepted with oodles and oodlesof evidence to back it up), teachers may assign it for readingbut they won't touch the topic in class with a ten foot pole.Among the sad/funny anecdotes -- one survey shows thatone-third of high school biology teachers believe in creationismor at least think it should be taught.Another good comment:"There is no credible scientific challenge to the idea that allliving things evolved from common ancestors, that evolution onearth has been going on for billions of years and that evolutioncan be and has been tested and confirmed by the methods ofscience. But in a 2001 survey, the National Science Foundationfound that only 53 percent of Americans agreed with thestatement "human beings, as we know them, developed fromearlier species of animals."" says the New York Times."And this was good news to the foundation. It was the firsttime one of its regular surveys showed a majority of Americanshad accepted the idea. According to the foundation report, pollsconsistently show that a plurality of Americans believe that Godcreated humans in their present form about 10,000 years ago,and about two-thirds believe that this belief should be taughtalong with evolution in public schools."God help us.
