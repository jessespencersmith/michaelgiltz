11/18/2004 07:56:00 PMWhen your debt piles up, you can do one of two things: starttackling that debt by spending less and paying off more thanthe monthly minimum. Or you can just ignore the problem bycalling up your credit card company and getting them to upyour credit limit from, say, $5000.00 to $8000.00 and keepspending like crazy.Wanna bet which tactic Bush chose?Yep, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to INCREASE thedebt limit by $800 billion."The bill, if approved by the House in a vote expected onThursday, would authorize the third big increase in the federalborrowing since President Bush took office in 2001. Federaldebt has ballooned by $1.4 trillion over the past four years, to$7.4 trillion, and the new ceiling would allow borrowing toreach $8.2 trillion," wrote the New York Times."With no end in sight to the huge annual budget deficits, whichhit a record of $412 billion this year, lawmakers predicted onWednesday that the new ceiling would probably have tobe raised again in about a year."Remember, Republicans have controlled everything for fouryears now and have more power than ever. EVERYTHING istheir fault now. Every increase in spending. Every terroristattack. Every old person that dies from lack of a flu shot. TheDemocrats should be having a field day with all this.
