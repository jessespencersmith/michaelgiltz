Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis swashbuckling tale is diverting fun and perhaps the first of a series, if I'm not mistaken. Princess Clarice is oneof twelve (!) daughters in a very tiny kingdom. The thirteenth child is a boy and the heir -- though there won't be muchfor him to heir if all his older sisters are given decent dowries. So as the eldest, Clarice is the first to go off and seekher fortune. Luckily, her parents are broad-minded sorts and she's very handy with a sword, thanks to a lifetime oftraining. Dreaming of establishing herself as a fencing master, Clarice knows she must first deliver some derring-do.Off she goes, disguised as a man and gallivanting about. Soon, she finds herself on a ship with a hateful captain, amutinous crew (rightly so) and a navigator she's grown awkwardly fond of indeed. It's awkward because saidnavigator -- the handsome and modest and clever Dominick -- believes Clarice to be his new best pal Clarence. Thesailors become pirates and before you know it they're snared into a somewhat fantastical quest while a sorcerousfrom The House Of The Four Winds (a pirate hang-out) plots their deaths whether or not they succeed. It's all goodfun, with the best bits involving Clarice wondering exactly how to tell Dominick she fancies him (probably AFTER shereveals her gender seems the consensus). The tale stumbles a bit with a finale that is poorly plotted and described(our heroes mostly avoid getting killed). But the overall vibe is fun and the pages slip by nimbly. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Explicitly feminist, extremely readable and entertaining.” —RT Book Reviews, 4 ½ stars, Top Pick! on Beauty andthe Werewolf“An awesome take on the world of fairy tales.” —RT Book Reviews, 4 ½ stars, Top Pick! on The Fairy Godmother“Delightful [and] amusing. Appealing characters faced with challenging circumstances keep the plot lively.” —RTBook Reviews on The Snow Queen“A narrative motif fit for a Technicolor swashbuckler. A fantasy fanatic’s feast.” —Kirkus Reviews on Crown ofVengeance“The three novellas are well written and entertaining . . . starring strong females.” —The Midwest Book Review onTrio of Sorcery“Trio of Sorcery gives us three talented, courageous heroines in an enjoyable urban fantasy collection.  Fascinatingwomen and stories that draw us into their worlds.” —Lesa’s Book Critiques (written by the winner of the 2011 ArizonaLibrary Association Outstanding Library Service Award) on Trio of SorceryWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
