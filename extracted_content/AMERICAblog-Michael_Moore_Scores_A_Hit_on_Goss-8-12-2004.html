8/12/2004 09:55:00 AMHere's an amusing Reuters story detailing Michael Moore's release ofan interview with Porter Goss done for "Fahrenheit 9/11.""'I couldn't get a job with CIA today. I am not qualified,'' the FloridaRepublican told documentary-maker Michael Moore's productioncompany during the filming of the anti-Bush movie ``Fahrenheit9/11.''"A day after Bush picked Goss for the top U.S. spy job, MooreWednesday released an excerpt from a March 3 interview in whichthe 65-year-old former House of Representatives intelligence chiefrecounts his lack of qualifications for employment as a modern CIAstaffer."'I don't have the language skills. I, you know, my language skillswere romance languages and stuff. We're looking for Arabists today. Idon't have the cultural background probably,'' Goss is quoted in aninterview transcript."'And I certainly don't have the technical skills, uh, as my childrenremind me every day: 'Dad you got to get better on your computer.'Uh, so, the things that you need to have, I don't have.''Moore's parting jab is that Goss granted the interview with Moore'sproducers without bothering to check who they were working for."'You'd think the person who was the head of the intelligencecommittee would ask a few more questions,'' said Moore."'The reality is that Porter Goss was in charge of the oversight of theCIA during a time when the CIA didn't do its job, which in partresulted in the loss of lives of 3,000 people,' he said via telephonefrom New York.But nothing tops the Bush response: it's all hearsay, they claim.Here's hoping the interview tape is sent out pronto by Moore to thenews media or at least posted online.Thanks to blogger Michael for alerting us to this story in hiscomments.
