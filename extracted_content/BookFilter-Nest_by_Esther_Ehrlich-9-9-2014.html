Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayThis debut novel by Esther Ehrlich is a winner. Set in 1972, it shows 11 year old Chirp dealing with her dancer mom'ssudden illness. As if a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis wasn't hard enough, Chirp's mom sinks into depression and hasto be institutionalized and conceivably undergo electro-shock therapy to snap her out of her doldrums. Chirp'spsychiatrist dad is annoyingly (if lovingly) ready to address her feelings and her older sister Rachel too quick to stepinto the role of mother. Still, as her travails pile up, one of the unexpected insights of "Nest" is that she may have itbetter than her neighbor and classmate Joey. Ehrlich never quite spells out what is going on in Joey's household, buthe's got three dangerous and bullying older brothers and a hateful father, not to mention what we would ID as someserious OCD issues. But that drama is only hinted at -- this isn't an AfterSchool Special. Esther and Joey simplybecome wary friends who have ups and downs with their misunderstandings and attempts to help each other. WhyChirp as a nickname? Because our heroine loves birds and is a budding naturalist who escapes to nature with herbinoculars whenever she can. That leads to a poignant scene late in the book and gives her a positive passion tocounteract all the high drama in Chirp's life. Ehrlich's book is excellent at depicting her family life, especially how anolder sibling can be annoying one moment and the most important person in the world to a kid in the next. "Nest" isfunny, sharp and quite moving. It's slotted in the category for kids and young adults, but anyone should savor thissharply written tale and its memorable heroine. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others SayKirkus starred review, May 15, 2014:“A poignant, insightful story of family crisis and the healing power of friendship.”School Library Journal starred review, May 15, 2014:A stunning debut, with lyrical prose and superbly developed characters, this novel is an emotional roller coaster thateffectively conveys a family’s visceral tragedy.Publishers Weekly starred review, July 14, 2014:"Ehrlich’s novel beautifully captures the fragile bond shared by Chirp and Joey and their growing trust for each otherin a world filled with disappointments and misunderstandings."What You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
