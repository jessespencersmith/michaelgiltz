6/23/2005 05:28:00 PMRove's comments -- backed up 100% by George Bush -- didn'tjust attack Democrats. Rove and Bush attacked anddemonized any American who dares to disagree withthem or just thinks they're doing a lousy job. 57% ofAmericans think Bush is doing a terrible job in Iraq. GeorgeBush says that makes them traitors. Half of all Americans whovoted in the last election didn't vote for George Bush. He saysthat makes them traitors. Anyone who thinks torture is a badidea? Traitor.Look at the last few days. George Bush's numbers arecollapsing. He couldn't get a "Fridays Off" law passed inCongress and the American people are increasingly worriedabout our troops in Iraq (maybe because they still aren'tproperly equipped?). So what does Bush do? First he attacksgays. Then he pushes the flag burning amendment. And todayhe attacks the majority of Americans who think he's doing alousy job and calls them traitors.It's very simple: George Bush has had almost four years tohunt down and kill Osama Bin Laden. He's failed miserably.Since George Bush is too weak to attack Bin Laden, he'sattacking Americans.
