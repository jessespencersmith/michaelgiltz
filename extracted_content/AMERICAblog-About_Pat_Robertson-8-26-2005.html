8/26/2005 10:24:00 AMA lot of things have annoyed me about the coverage of PatRobertson's latest unChristian, unAmerican and unbelievablebroadside -- this one calling for the assassination ofVenezuela's leader. First, as Jon Stewart so nimblydemonstrated, Robertson is an esteemed, beloved figure on theRepublican side. They use him to raise money and get votesand generally treat him like a major figure. He is NOT thewacky uncle that everyone ignores. And when Robertson tossesoff one of these vicious and wacky comments, Bush and mostfar right "Christian" groups can't even bring themselves todenounce cold-blooded murder.But the part that annoyed me the most? Almost none of thecoverage made clear that Chavez is the democratically electedleader of his country. Bush encouraged a military coup -- whichoverthrew Chavez's government -- and then gave the thumbsup to the junta that wanted to replace him. Only a stirringdemonstration of people power forced the military to backdown (much to Bush's chagrin) and Chavez was put back inplace. He's since won reelection under a vote that was lesscontested than Bush's two paths to glory in 2000 and 2004.How can anyone call Chavez a critic of Bush and then fail topoint out that Bush encouraged his overthrow? Especially sincethis proves Bush is lying when he claims to be spreadingdemocracy. You can't support democracy just when it suits you-- as Bush has done his entire presidency.And yet even middle of the road USA Today referred to Chavezas a "populist strongman." He is NOT a strongman (whateveryou think of his pronouncements or policies). Chavez is thedemocratically elected leader of Venezuela and sits on one ofthe world's largest supplies of oil -- and Bush wanted himoverthrown. He has every reason to distrust and dislike Bush,as does any Venezuelan who believes in democracy and thesovereign rights of nations to be left alone.
