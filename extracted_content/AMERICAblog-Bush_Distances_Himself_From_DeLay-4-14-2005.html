4/14/2005 02:57:00 AMThe fun keeps on coming for Tom DeLay, who tried to ignorethe ethical swamp he's sinking in and attack judges who dareto disagree with him. In a day or two, he'll have to blame avast, right-wing conspiracy for his troubles. Ricky Santorumsaid he has to come clean (DeLay pretended it was acompliment). Newt Gingrich said DeLay needed to stop tryingto blame the left and deal with his problems in a forthrightmanner. Rep. Christopher Shays of Conn. said he should stepdown.And now Bush is sidling away from DeLay as well. According tothe New York Times, at a White House press briefing, ScottMcClellan said"... the president supported what Mr. DeLay and otherCongressional leaders were doing 'to move forward on theagenda that the American people want us to enact.'"But Mr. McClellan suggested that the relationshipbetween Mr. Bush and Mr. DeLay, a fellow Texan, wasmore business than social."'Sure,' Mr. McClellan said, when asked if the presidentconsidered Mr. DeLay a friend. He went on, 'I thinkthere are different levels of friendship with anybody.'"Ouch.
