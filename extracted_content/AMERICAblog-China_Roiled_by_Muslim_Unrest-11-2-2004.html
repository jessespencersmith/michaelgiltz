11/02/2004 07:27:00 PMFirst, it's been VERY hard to post because of the massive traffic to ourblog. Thanks for checking in and sorry there haven't been moreupdates. Your comments on the I Voted and Election Day storythreads have been great.But the rest of the world keeps on turning. In China, "ethnic" clasheserupted in a province, leading to at least 148 deaths (per the police)and much more according to others. Notable for two reasons. First,the "ethnic" clashes -- as described by the New York Times -- arereally more evidence of Muslim unrest around the world. Second, thecentral government in China is admitting to the unrest, whennormally news about massive strikes and unrest that regularly (yes,regularly) occur throughout that massive nation leaks out over weeksand is downplayed or suppressed by the government. More signs thatthe new head of China wants new openness as in their approach tothe problems with SARS?"The incident is the latest challenge for the authorities in a societythat has become markedly prone to social unrest. A growing wealthgap and persistent corruption and backwardness in rural areas havefueled riots in the countryside and in secondary cities. Large-scaledemonstrations, some violent, are no longer rare."Ethnic violence is less common. Hui Muslims, one of the country's 56official ethnic groups, trace their origins to Central Asia. But theyresemble Han Chinese, who make up about 90 percent of thepopulation, and are considered well integrated into Chinese society."The details of the Henan incident remain sketchy and the number ofcasualties is in dispute. But it appears to have been one of the largestand most sustained ethnic clashes in many years."
