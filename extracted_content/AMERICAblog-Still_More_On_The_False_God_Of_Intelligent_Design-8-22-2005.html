8/22/2005 11:08:00 AMThe NYT does another big piece on creationism -- again, it'sportrayed as a debate, as a back-and-forth argument about theworld around us. A "balanced" article would have emphasizedthat ID has virtually no backing in the scientific community --they claim 400 scientists support ID or at least think it's worthdebating. I can find 400 scientists who think UFOs and aliensvisit earth regularly. 400 scientists is what, .0001 percent of allscientists in the world? You don't teach grade school children"both sides" -- you teach them what is widely accepted. Period.The article calls ID a "school of thought," when it should becalled a religious belief with no scientific standing which can'tbe proved or disproved because it depends on faith. The articlehints at how its all been stirred up by just a handful of peoplefunded by the Discovery Institute and ALL their successes areat school boards and in politics -- none of them are in thelaboratory or in science journals. Shouldn't that be the focus ofevery article?William Safire even weighs in via his grammar column.Annoyingly, he ends it with a quote from an apparently cluelessNobel laureate at Brown University named Leon Cooper:''If we could all lighten up a bit perhaps, we could havesome fun in the classroom discussing the evidence and theproposed explanations -- just as we do at scientificconferences.''First, middle school kids aren't trained scientists debating an issue.Second, can you imagine the outcry if a science teacher really "taughtthe debate" and emphasized that ID -- as far as science is concerned-- is total hogwash?
