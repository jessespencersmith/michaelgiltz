Peripatetic Career

Director Werner Herzog is well into one of the
most eclectic, odd and engaging movie careers,one that jumps from personal epics to quixoticdocumentary films, and now even Hollywoodspectacles. His latest movie -- Encounters At TheEnd Of The World  ($27.98; Image) -- is a
typically eccentric, engrossing and beautiful lookat Antarctica. Herzog's grumpy narration is oneof the joys of this quirky movie -- he arrives atthis barren outpost and is thoroughly disgustedto see popular culture intruding even here. Theway he drips with contempt about "yoga classes"
is a joy for misanthropes everywhere. But Herzog can't help himself. Even with such barriers togetting away from it all he manages to explore the strange and dangerous beauty of this locationwhile discovering the real heart of the film: the strange and driven people who land here. (Mostdon't seem to have chosen Antarctica so much as simply found themselves there unexpectedly.)Scientists, "professional dreamers," cranks. They're the strangest lifeforms to be found there. Andwhile this film doesn't have the narrative thrust of say, Grizzly Man , it's a thoroughly entertaining
diversion. A second DVD contains loads of extras, including Jonathan Demme interviewing Herzoghimself.
More Documentaries  -- Gonzo: The Life And Work Of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson  ($26.98;
Magnolia) covers the pioneering journalist's career but is mostly a pleasant excuse to have his
famous friends -- like narrator Johnny Depp share their most entertaining stories about him; truly,the legend was outstripped by the (rather maniacal) man. Operation Valkyrie: The Staufenber PlotTo Kill Hitler ($19.98; Koch) is a so-so primer for the Tom Cruise movie about the Naziconspirators who tried to take out the Fuhrer. Planet B-Boy  ($19.95; Arts Alliance America) is a
documentary about break dancing around the world that disabuses people like me of the idea thatit was just a fad from the 80s. Some great stuff here. Garbage Warrior ($24.98; Open Eye Media)looks at architect Michael Reynolds and his sustainable eco-homes built from detritus and waste.

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: Werner Herzog's Peripatetic Career
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-werner-herzogs-perip_b_145610.html [4/5/2009 1:01:35 PM]He's more of an eccentric calling attention to waste than the purveyor of genuine solutions, but Al
Gore fans will love it. Bringing Balanchine Back  ($19.98; City Lights) lovingly shows the New York
City Ballet visiting Russia and preparing for a performance in St. Petersburg at the MariinskyTheater where the company's late co-founder had his roots. Catnip for casual fans of dance.
Manhattan, Kansas  ($19.95; Carnivalesque) is the painfully personal story of filmmaker Tara Wray
struggling to deal with her emotionally disturbed mother who is determined to discover the
Geodetic Center of the US, which she believes will bring about world peace. Up The Yangtze
($29.99; Zeitgeist) is a remarkably frank look at China's Three Gorges Dam and the dramatic
impact it has on the lives of the people displaced by it. It's a piercing look at the economic
steamroller shaping that country and how it got made, I'll never know.
BluRay Releases  -- Band Of Brothers  on BluRay ($99.98; HBO) is a top-notch release of one of
the best projects Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have done. Superior to Saving Private Ryan
thanks to the scope and detail a miniseries offers, BoB  is just a a terrific miniseries. The sound
especially is top-notch on this set and you get all the extras of the standard release plus more newstuff. Looks better and better with the passing years. I agonize over BluRay -- Hollywood should beusing this superior format to keep people buying DVDs, not as an excuse to increase prices. But itis a serious step forward in picture quality, especially for those who have a 1080p widescreen TV.Firefly: The Complete Series  ($89.98; Fox) is a wonderfully compact collection of all 17 episodes
from the cultish Joss Whedon series that followed Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  Here's hoping for
more movie spin-offs. The Universe: Complete Season One ($79.95; History/A&E) makes full useof this science show's computer graphics and amazing visuals. Kung Fu Panda  ($39.99;
Dreamworks) is another super-cool looking disc of the surprisingly effective animated film.Animation in general looks awesome on BluRay, so it's no surprise at all that Wall-E ($40.99;
Disney) is also a show-stopper, especially those gorgeous early scenes where Wall-E wanders alonethrough the Earth's desolate landscape. Paul McCartney: The Space Within Us  ($34.95; A&E) is a
Beatles-heavy concert heard in terrific sound and hi-def, with the cute Beatle looking just fine ashe cruises past 64. Tropic Thunder  ($39.99; Dreamworks) is a whole lot of heavy lifting for some
light comedy, but you do get Robert Downey Jr. in blackface. BluRay-only releases include TheStory Of O ($29.98; Somerville House), the softcore French precursor to 9 1/2 Weeks  and Black
Christmas  ($29.98; Somerville House) director Bob Clark's cult horror movie that is an entirely
different take on the holiday he celebrated in A Christmas Story. Loads of extras include newinterviews with Margot Kidder, a new documentary, cast members on a panel and more.
DVD Games  -- Movie and TV DVD sales are down. In fact, a lot of areas of entertainment are
down, like collapsing CD sales and primetime TV ratings. But one bright spot is video games. In an
attempt to squeeze out some more business, Disney and Warner Bros. and others are coming upwith DVD Game releases on their top franchises. High School Musical DVD Game  and Hannah
Montana DVD Game  ($29.99 each; Disney) contain very basic stabs at interactive gaming, with
chances to karaoke and dance along with tracks from these shows. Scooby-Doo DVD Game($19.98; Warner Bros.) is an even more desperate attempt at interactivity with players using theremote to spot clues, match images, identify sounds and other painfully basic tasks. Obviously,none of these come within a country mile of the polish and excitement and cleverness of real videogames and using the DVD remote to navigate them proves how staid they are. This is one hybridthat consumers should avoid.
Stax Up Against Any Other Music Label  -- The Stax label ranks with Motown and Sun as one
of the defining record labels of the rock/pop/soul era. Respect Yourself: The Stax Records Story
($24.98; Infinity) is a terrific documentary narrated by Samuel L. Jackson that captures the
electric talent of Stax, its remarkable rise and places it all in the context of the times. As a "bonus" -
- and really, calling it just a bonus seems almost crazy -- you get Stax Volt Revue -- Live In Norway
1967, a legendary concert that shows the Stax family in full force, winding up with Otis Reddingsending the polite Norwegian crowd into a frenzy with repeated encores on "Try A LittleTenderness."
Other Music Releases  -- Wild Combination  ($24.99; Plexifilm) is an engrossing look at Arthur
Russell, the avant-garde composer who also produced disco songs, wrote pop tunes and generally
shone bright before dying of AIDS in 1992. With contributions ranging from Philip Glass to JensLekman, that gives you an idea of the wide range of styles he traveled in. High Fidelity  ($24.95;
First Run) is an engrossing look at the Guarneri String Quartet as they tour the world. LegendaryPerformances: Merle Haggard  ($14.98; Shout) is the latest in a series of DVDs that pulls together

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs: Werner Herzog's Peripatetic Career
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-werner-herzogs-perip_b_145610.html [4/5/2009 1:01:35 PM]every TV clip and performance they can find by an artist, which is catnip for any fan who loves
them. How else would you see clips from long-lost shows like Billy Walker's Country Carnival  and
The Porter Wagoner Show? Parliament Funkadelic: The Mothership Connection Live 1976($14.98; Shout) is a Halloween night performance with George Clinton's band in full funk andtearing the roof off. Cosmic slop indeed. Alison Kraus: A Hundred Miles Or More ($17.98;Rounder) is a lovely but too brief show with the sublime bluegrass singer joined by James Taylor,Brad Paisley and others. Live From Abbey Road: The Best Of Season One  ($19.98; Fremantle) is
two+ hours of music from the best music show on TV right now. They just bring artists into AbbeyRoad and film them talking about music and performing their songs. Among the acts: CorinneBailey Rae, Dr. John, Wynton Marsalis, Amos Lee, Kasabian and many more. The new season iscurrently airing on Sundance;  don't miss it. Smashing Pumpkins: If All Goes Wrong  ($21.98;
Coming Home Media) features a show from their 2007 tour and a full documentary about thetravails of making it happen. it proves you can go home again...if you don't mind squabbling alongthe way. It's much easier if you never leave home, like Twisted Sister: Live At The Astoria ($20.98;DR2) who are still not gonna take it, even at a 2004 concert in London captured here on CD andDVD. Finally, Wu: The Story of the Wu-Tang Clan ($22.98; Paramount) is a substantial look atthe seminal rap band by witer-producer-director Gerald K. Barclay.
DW Griffith: Attention Must Be Paid  -- Another substantial DVD boxed set of pioneering
Hollywood director DW Griffith from Kino, this one modestly titled Griffith Masterworks 2
($89.95; Kino). It's hardly a boastful claim since Griffith was such a seminal figure in early movies
and scholars and movie buffs should revel in these glorious prints. But this isn't quite as essential
as Volume 1. Sally Of The Sawdust  (1925) stars WC Fields in his second movie, but Fields without
that inimitable voice is a mere shadow of what he'd accomplish later, juggling or no juggling. The
Avenging Conscience  (1914) is an entertaining mash-up of various Edgar Allan Poe stories. But his
two sound films -- Abraham Lincoln  (1930) and The Struggle  (1931) -- seem constricted by the
need to stay chained to boom mikes, despite Walter Houston's saintly portrayal of our last greatPresident who sprang from Illinois. But the final two discs are the real keepers. DW Griffith: The
Father Of Film  is a 156 minute long documentary about his work. And Way Down East  (1920) is
his seminal melodrama, with that still-astonishing ice floe sequence at the finale.
Other Stuff -- Popeye The Sailor Volume Three 1941-1943  ($34.98; Warner Bros.) is 32 more
shorts of the grumbling spinach lover, many naturally with a war theme. Buffs will appreciate the
many extras; kids will just giggle. Goya  ($24.95; First Run) is a look at the radical painte circa
East Germany's Konrad Wolf. Blood and Bones ($29.95; Kino) is the epic tale of a Korean in Japanconsumed by violence with "Beat" Takeshi Kitano digging deep as the brutal head of his family.Much lighter is Sukiyaki Western Django  ($28.98 or $34.98 on BluRay; First Look), the latest
Asian spin on spaghetti westerns, this time by Takashi Miike. Shaun The Sheep: Off The Baa!($14.98; Lionsgate/HIT) is a compilation of eight amiable shorts from the creators of Wallace &Gromit and being free of the demands of a full-length film brings out the best in them. Realysweet. The Apprentice  ($15.98; Somerville House) captures a young Susan Sarandon investing her
all in what amounts to little more than a quickie indie flick with lots of sexual intrigue. Treasury Of20 Storybook Classics  ($29.95; New Video/Scholastic) collects 4 DVDs with 20 stories minimally
animated but caringly read by celebrity voices like BD Wong, Sean Hayes and more.
Rod Serling's Greatest Work  -- Some would argue his greatest triumph was the live TV play,
Requiem For A Heavyweight. Most everyone else would name the one show everyone has heard of:
The Twilight Zone.  But some hardcore fans single out his later anthology series, the more gothic
show Night Gallery. They're wrong, of course. The Twilight Zone  is unquestionably Serling's
masterpiece. But Night Gallery Season Two ($59.98; Universal) is still fun, especially since theproducers hadn't started rejecting Serling's scripts haphazardly, the way they would in the thirdand final season. It's no surprise to find director Guillermo Del Toro providing audio commentary -- this sort of creepy suspense is right up his alley.
Other TV Stuff -- Father Knows Best Season Two  ($39.99; Shout), a solid sitcom from a time
when people actually believed that to be true. Doctor Who: The Complete Fourth Series  ($99.98;
BBC Video) is the latest batch of episodes featuring the best Doctor since Tom Baker -- David
Tennant, we'll miss you. The Odd Couple Season 5  ($39.98; Paramount) is the final season for the
enduring silliness of two mismatched roomies; the defining New York sitcom until Seinfeld camealong. Hannah Montana: The Complete First Season  ($39.99; Disney), is the Miley Cyrus series
that redefined how popular a basic cable sitcom could be. Bones Season Three  ($59.98; Fox) is the
crime show that glides by almost completely thanks to the marvelous chemistry of David Boreanaz

and Emily Deschanel. Casting is indeed everything. Tracey Ullman's State Of The Union  ($26.9;
Eagle Rock) proves this chameleon can indeed capture the essence of anyone (including Huffington
herself). Fun, but I still yearn to see her original sketch show finally collected on DVD as well. The
Commander Set 1  ($59.99; Acorn) finds creator Lynda La Plante covering familiar territory (a
driven female police officer with a messy private life) but Amanda Burton does her best to avoid
Mirren-like comparisons. and it's good fun for British mystery buffs. SpongeBob SquarePants
Season 5 Volume 2  ($26.98; Paramount) brings to mind the fact that the show's creator was gonna
call it a day ages ago but reconsidered, thank goodness. Silliness never goes out of style.  Mitzi
Gaynor: Razzle Dazzle -- The Special Years  ($24.98; City Lights) offers highlights from Gaynor's
TV specials from the 60s and 70s. Fans will be relieved to get it, but one hour (and 80 minutes of
bonus features) is far too little given the number of shows she did. Blame the cost of securing
music rights, I imagine. Hawaii Five-0 Fifth Season  ($38.99; Paramount) finds the venerable cop
show in its peak of popularity when the show ranked #3 for the season.
