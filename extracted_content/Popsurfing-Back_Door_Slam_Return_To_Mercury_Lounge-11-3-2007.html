            <p>S AT U R D AY,  N O V E M B E R  0 3 ,  2 0 0 7Back Door Slam Return To Mercury LoungeAmazingly, despite the collapse of the record industry and the feelingthat all the rules have been thrown out the window, rock and roll canstill happen just the way it always did. I saw the UK power trio BackDoor Slam a few months ago at the insistence of their publicist. Threeyoung white guys -- 20 to 21 years old -- who play the blues a la Creamand Jimi Hendrix with a lead singer who looks 17 and sounds like aweathered bluesman (he has a terrific voice) and plays like a flashyguitar god. In other words, they were terrific. The space had maybe 25people in it at the most, including a grey-haired lady who stood nearthe front who was either one of their moms or just a hardcore older fan.When they returned, I invited a bunch of friends to the show,something I've never really done -- but with a $10 admission andconvenient early showtime, it made sense. To my shock, eight peoplejoined me and I suddenly felt the weight of responsibility. Would allthese different people like the band? Mercury Lounge was much morecrowded this night. I don't think any of the four other acts were thedraw, but who knows? I'd like to think it was word of mouth. The firsttime I showed up in a party of two; this time I showed up with a partyof eight. The room was filled about twice as much, the band explodedagain and was sensational and everyone with me really liked it.Suddenly, I was going to be emailing them when the band returned inJanuary. Maybe I'll bring a party of 16 that time? But the mainstoryline is as old as rock: you tour, wow the fans and keep returning toa town again and again and every time you play to bigger crowds andwin more fans. It still works! By the way, their debut CD is okay butdoesn't begin to capture the power of the band live. Check them out ifyou can.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
