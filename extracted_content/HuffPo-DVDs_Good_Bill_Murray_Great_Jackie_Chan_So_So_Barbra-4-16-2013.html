What have we got on tap? Bill Murray as FDR and other new releases, a great Jackie
Chan double bill, one of Barbra Streisand's lesser works, a clutch of documentaries,some titles for baseball fans to watch on their team's off day, a string of auteuristgems, and a TV roundup.
HYDE PARK ON HUDSON  ($34.98 BluRay;
Universal) -- Bill Murray is surprisingly goodas the patrician, blue=blooded FDR, ready tojoin the fight in WW II but needing England towoo his voters into supporting it. Murraycertainly wouldn't spring to mind whencasting the role but he's effective on everylevel. It's a pity the film he's in is so drab and
dull; it turns even Laura Linney into a boring
mouse of a distant relative and current love
of the great man. (One of many.) A weekend
when royalty visits is the excuse for this very
modest drama with very little on its mind.
Murray deserved much better.
GATE OF HELL  ($29.99 BluRay; Criterion) -- Often, the movies released by Criterion
are well-known masterpieces. When it's a film I haven't heard of, I sit up and takenotice. Gate Of Hell seems to have fallen off the radar but it's certainly no obscureentry. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa's period epic about doomed romance won theOscar for Best Foreign Film as well as the Oscar for Best Costumes. And no wonder!The film is visually dazzling, to say the least, with gorgeous costumes just one ofmany striking elements in this story of a warrior who falls in love with a married lady-in-waiting but just can't take no for an answer. One of Japan's first color films, it usescolor as brilliantly as any of the masters to tell its story and was a worldwide success.
Only the fragile prints and the cost of restoration kept it out of the public eye for
decades. Now it's returned to prominence thanks to a 2011 restoration, beautifullypresented here by Criterion.
PARENTAL GUIDANCE  ($39.99 BluRay;
FOX) -- Bette Midler's return to Broadway inthe one-woman show I'll Eat You Last  can't
come soon enough. Here is she in a witlesscomedy with Billy Crystal about grandparentsMay 8, 2014
 This is the print preview:

<p>asked to watch over their grandkids for a
spell. Hilarity ensues until -- god help us --lessons are learned. Presumably, as superagent Sue Mengers, Midler won't be learningany lessons on Broadway, just returning tothe bawdy, penetrating humor that made hergreat.
POLICE STORYAND POLICESTORY 2  ($19.99
BluRay; Shout)IRONWEED ($29.99
BluRay;
Olive/Paramount)
HELLO, DOLLY!
($24.99 BluRay;FOX) -- One of
Jackie Chan's major
triumphs, his Hong
Kong action gem
Police Story  is filled with great stunts
and genuine suspense, as opposed tothe comic humor he'd been known forpreviously. It's paired on a no-frillsrelease with the sequel Police Story2.
Ironweed  may seem less compelling
as time has passed, but you can'tbeat the pairing of Jack Nicholsonand Meryl Streep (and Tom Waits!)
as down-on-their luck street
denizens. The pacing is sluggish but
their acting is superb. The scene where Streep fantasizes that the customers in a bar
have cajoled her into singing breaks my heart every time.
Finally, Hello, Dolly!  is one of those lumbering movie musicals that typify the studio
system for me in the 1960s. Director Gene Kelly did Barbra Streisand no favors with
this two ton dinosaur. Poor Carol Channing deserved the part but at least her iconicperformance wasn't weighed down by the trappings here. Musicals should not beexhausting.
THE
BLUE PLANET($39.99 BluRay; BBCEarth)WINGS OF LIFE($39.99 BluRay;Disney)ORCHESTRA OF
EXILES  ($27.95</p>
<p>DVD; First Run
Features)PHILIP ROTHUNMASKED  ($24.99
DVD; PBS)VIETNAM: THE TENTHOUSAND DAYWAR  ($$39.99 DVD;
TimeLife/StarVista)ERROLL GARNER:
NO ONE CAN HEAR
YOU READ  ($24.99
DVD; First RunFeatures) -- It's been12 years since The
Blue Planet  came
out. That's not too
soon to say it may bethe greatest naturedocumentary film ofall time, stunninglybeautiful, smart,informative,ambitious andentertaining. It'scertainly a landmarkin television andevery bit as influential
as The Civil War  by
Ken Burns. Longoverdue on BluRay,
it's here in all its
glory.
Wings Of Life  is just one of the many films
coming in the wake of The Blue Planet.
Disney established DisneyNature, released atheatrical version of The Blue Planet  and
stepped up its own releases. Of course it hasa long history of nature films, but they'vereally raised their game in the past decade.Director Louis Schwartzberg steps into the
big time with this film, which uses high speed photography to capture birds and beesand other flying creates in remarkable close-ups.
As the New York Times pointed out in its review, Orchestra Of Exiles  is notable not
just for its compelling story about the formation of what became the Israel
Philharmonic Orchestra. What makes the film unusual is that it didn't just capture thisstory unearthed by others; it delved into the facts and broke ground in the historical
record that few other films ever attempt much less manage.
Since he's officially "retired," maybe we can start to place the late-career run of
genius from author Philip Roth in context and appreciate it more completely. It's now abody of work, rather than a living, growing entity. Certainly that should be how theNobel Prize committee treats it, since Roth should be a shoo-in in the next year ortwo if quality and an extraordinary career have anything to do with it. This PBS special-- Philip Roth Unmasked  -- starts the process, though it spends more time than I'm
interested in on parallels between Roth's personal life and his work. Who cares?
The masterpiece of reporter Peter Arnett and producer Michael Maclear, Vietnam:
The Ten Thousand Day War  is a 26 part Canadian documentary series that came out
in 1980, providing a balanced, sober, comprehensive and eye-opening overview ofthe Vietnam which had just ended a few years earlier. Maclear traveled to Vietnamand secured rare footage while Arnett had been stationed in Vietnam as a journalistfor many years. Its breadth and depth is impressive as is the perspective the seriesoffers despite appearing so soon after the last soldiers returned. This edition isessentially the same though it has included new graphics at certain points to makethe story being told clearer.
If you're going to talk about a jazz great like pianist Erroll Garner, you can't really go</p>
<p>wrong with some appreciative talking heads and lots of lots of archival footage
showing Garner doing his stuff. That's what you get here in this 53 minute labor of
love by director Atticus Brady. I assume money was an issue but the relatively shortrunning time would have been nicely augmented by more footage of even a completeconcert, however raw the footage.
KNUCKLEBALL  ($24.99 DVD;
FilmBuff)THE SANDLOT 20THANNIVERSARY  ($19.99 BluRay;
FOX) -- Baseball season is in fullswing. You might think fans would
save books and movies about this
sport for the November-March off
season. And yet, it's somehow toopainful to talk about baseball when
you can't watch it. That's why 42
came out in theaters once the seasonbegan (to big box office) and these
two releases are out in stores. Knuckleball  is a fine
documentary for ardent fans of the sport that followed the two
major leaguers who use the knuckleball. Their timing was perfect: they capturedpitcher Tim Wakefield's final season and caught R. A. Dickey just as he was rising tofame. In 2012 (when the film came out) Dickey would become the first knuckleballerin history to win pitching's Cy Young Award.
The Sandlot  is a kid's film with summer games of baseball as the backdrop for the
usual youthful tales of first kisses, bullies and the like. Mind you, moms and dads with
fond memories of their own childhood hijinks on the diamond will happily watch it too.It's the 20th anniversary but let's not confuse that with being genuinely good. Still, it isbaseball.
THE SUNSHINES
BRIGHT
($29.99
BluRay;
Olive/Paramount)
RUTHLESS  ($29.99 BluRay; Olive/Paramount)
CHINA GATE  ($29.99 BluRay; Olive/Paramount)
PANIC IN THE STREETS  ($24.99 BluRay; FOX) -- An
auteurist's delight! Four films from four notable directors, all indecent prints on BluRay. John Ford's The Sun Shines Brightis a gentle drama and Ford's personal favorite. It's certainlybursting at the seams with his usual gallery of supportingplayers. This BluRay contains the preferred director's cut ofthe film about a judge running for reelection in 1905Kentucky.
Ruthless  is Edgar G. Ulmer's little-discussed melodrama
about a ruthless millionaire who will stop at nothing -- nothing!
-- to make more money. A fine supporting cast, again, and the film poster tagline
sums it up nicely: Money and Power. Money and Power.
Samuel Fuller knows his way around a war zone and it shows in China Gate,  an
action film about mercenaries set in Vietnam during the tail end of the French
occupation. Fuller wrote, produced and directed; the cast includes Gene Barry, LeeVan Cleef, Angie Dickinson and even Nat King Cole (who sings the title song!).Beautifully shot, it's a trim and nasty tale of mercenaries hired to blow up an armsdepot in enemy territory. It's The Dirty Dozen  ten years early, in a way.
Finally, Elia Kazan insists Panic In The Streets  is the only "perfect" film he ever made,
achieving exactly what he set out to do in this noir tale of Jack Palance as a ruthlesskiller on the lam and Richard Widmark as the medical examiner trying to track himdown because he knows the fugitive is the carrier of a deadly plague. Great fun.
THE</p>
<p>BIBLE ($69.99
BluRay; FOX)BOSS SEASONTWO  ($39.99
BluRay; Lionsgate)THE DICK VANDYKE SHOWSEASON 1($59.98 BluRay;RLJ)SPIES OFWARSAW  ($24.99
BluRay; BBC)
ROUTE 66 THE
COMPLETE
FOURTHSEASON  ($29.99
DVD; Shout) -- Ifgood intentionsmade goodtelevision, The
Bible  would be a
masterpiece. Unfortunately, it gives biblical epics a bad name-- and a lot of biblical epics are pretty tiresome already. itdoesn't have the fun of The Ten Commandments  or the
authenticity of some other, braver tellings of these stories. It'sjust earnest and dull.
Kelsey Grammer found the second role of a lifetime
(obviously, Frasier was first) in Boss , a drama about a
ruthless mayor of Chicago. (Is there any other kind?)Unfortunately, he couldn't find an audience and Starz wasn'tready to plunk down for a third season on prestige alone. The
Emmys really could have made a difference here. Watch the
two seasons to see what you missed.
The Dick Van Dyke Show  is one of the all-time great sitcoms. It's coming out on
BluRay and looks good, if pricey.
I still think of David Tennant as Doctor Who so obviously he left that franchise not a
moment too soon. Nonetheless, though I occasionally think "The Doctor!" and wonderwhy he doesn't pull out his sonic screwdriver when in a jam, Tennant has impressedme on stage and TV in various other roles. Here in Spies Of Warsaw he plays a warhero and blue blood drawn into intrigue in Poland before World War II.
Finally, it took a while. But fans of Route 66  who bought each season as it came out
and then felt ripped off when a complete boxed set was released can rejoice. They're
now free to buy just the fourth and final season of this anthology series posing as aroad series about Todd and Linc traveling from town to town and discovering America.Lots of strong guest stars and an eye-opener for its time.
