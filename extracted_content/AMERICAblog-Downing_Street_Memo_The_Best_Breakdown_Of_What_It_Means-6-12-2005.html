6/12/2005 12:10:00 PM(Thanks to Sarah B. for directing us to this.) I'm not a big fanof just pointing people towards an article. I like to link two orthree articles together to make a larger point, or analyze why Ithink an article missed the important issue or otherwiseprovide value-added blogging. But some articles just have tobe read.So read Mark Danner's "The Secret Way To War" for the NewYork Review of Books. Unlike the Washington Post story on A-1linked to below (way to stay on the ball guys, with an articlethat could have been written a month ago), this is an excellentanalysis of what it means, why it's important and the realpurpose of going to the UN (which both Bush and Blair offeredup as "evidence" the DSM got it wrong). And though Bushimplied the timing of the DSM's release was political, neither henor Blair questioned its authenticity. One of many highlights:At this point in the meeting Prime Minister Tony Blairweighed in. He had heard his foreign minister's suggestionabout drafting an ultimatum demanding that Saddam letback in the United Nations inspectors. Such an ultimatumcould be politically critical, said Blair—but only if the Iraqileader turned it down:The Prime Minister said that it would make a bigdifference politically and legally if Saddam refusedto allow in the UN inspectors. Regime change andWMD were linked in the sense that it was theregime that was producing the WMD.... If thepolitical context were right, people would supportregime change. The two key issues were whetherthe military plan worked and whether we had thepolitical strategy to give the military plan thespace to work.Here the inspectors were introduced, but as a meansto create the missing casus belli. If the UN could bemade to agree on an ultimatum that Saddam acceptinspectors, and if Saddam then refused to acceptthem, the Americans and the British would be well ontheir way to having a legal justification to go to war(the attorney general's third alternative of UN SecurityCouncil authorization).Thus, the idea of UN inspectors was introduced not asa means to avoid war, as President Bush repeatedlyassured Americans, but as a means to make warpossible.
