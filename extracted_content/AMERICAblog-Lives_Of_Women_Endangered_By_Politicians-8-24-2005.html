8/24/2005 12:42:00 PMA study in the Journal of the AMA determined after looking athundreds of scientific papers that a fetus up to 29 weeks isunlikely to feel pain and there's no need for anesthesia duringabortions. Laws in numerous states are demanding thatanesthesia -- one of the most dangerous and difficult ofprocedures -- be administered anyway. Two thoughts:1. This is just like the "debate" over evolution. There is noscientific evidence for creationism but they insist the mountainsof evidence for evolution are "incomplete." There is noevidence anesthesia is necessary during this procedure but thefar right will insist the mountains of evidence saying it's notneeded is "incomplete."2. This is not about abortion. Anesthesia is very tricky toadminister and can endanger lives. Politicians are endangeringthe lives of women unnecessarily and without any medicalevidence to back them up. They will literally be killing womento make a political point. Whatever you think about abortion orany ethical issue, dangerous and unnecessary medicalprocedures should be administered only on the advice of adoctor and because sound medical evidence says it's needed,not because some politician wants to score points.
