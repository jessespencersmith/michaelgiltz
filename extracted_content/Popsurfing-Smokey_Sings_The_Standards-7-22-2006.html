            <p>S AT U R D AY,  J U LY  2 2 ,  2 0 0 6Smokey Sings The StandardsMy friends at NYCD urged me to give a listen to "Timeless Love," a newalbum of standards by Smokey Robinson. After the Rod Stewartnightmare, it's hard to approach any aging pop star who unexpectedlytackles the Great American Songbook. But this one is good, theyinsisted. So I listened. I always try just to watch a movie or read a bookor listen to a CD or watch a show as simply as possible. I don't spendmy time listening for lines to quote, I never take notes -- I'm not acritic. Just a fan who hopes what I'm experiencing is good. On the otherhand, I'm not an automaton, and music more than most art let's youmake song-by-song snap judgments. I had an insight, I thought, duringthe first tune, "You Go To My Head." Smokey sang a phrase or two --"You go to my head/ My head/ My head" -- in a way that sounded tome like a pop song. He wasn't going for jazz phrasing, I imagined, butjust treating these tunes as great pop songs, which they obviously werebefore being enshrined as standards. And of course, Smokey isattentive to the lyrics (like most great singers) so it wasn't a dumbingdown of the songs, just an approach that fitted his style. That thoughtfaded from my mind as the album went along. The arrangements weretasteful, acoustic and jazz-y with some strings. The songs were wellsung, though in the middle I grew a tad impatient with one too manyballads. Things picked up again with (ironically) a very slowed downtake on Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" that helped me hear thelyrics again, followed by a finger-snapping "I Can't Give You AnythingBut Love (Baby)." So just as I accepted the album for a pleasing, jazz-ytake on the standards with happily unembellished vocals, Smokeybegan "I've Got You Under My Skin" with a wicked bassline. Then camesome nifty keyboards that created a distinctive early 70s soul vibe.Here was a jazz standard recast as a soul tune so effectively I wasthrilled. Now it wasn't just the vocal approach of that first tune, it wasthe arrangement, the instrumentation, EVERYTHING combining toturn this standard into a classic soul number. That was followed by thefinale -- a Slow Jam take on "Tea For Two" that was similarly daring inits musical approach. It's got to be the most radical approach to thattune since Anita O'Day swung it at the Newport Jazz Festival. So wehave a fine, mellow album of standards that finishes off with a flourish-- and those final two numbers are frustrating, because they point inthe direction Smokey might have gone.
