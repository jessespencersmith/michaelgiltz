Theater: Tempest  Brews Off
Broadway

Mandy Patinkin is a wonderful actor I'd never
seen perform live. So it was a treat to check outthe Classic Stage Company's new production of
Shakespeare's The Tempes t last week. This vital
Off Broadway venue regularly attracts big namesfor short runs in their intimate space andobviously having Mandy Patinkin available wasreason enough to mount Prospero's tale.Certainly director Brian Kulick hasn't radicallyrethought the play and that's all to the good. Toooften, people feel obliged to put some novel spinon Shakespeare or twist a character 180 degrees
away from the original intention. Not here. This is The Tempest  with no muss or fuss or bizarre
spin. That doesn't, however, make it satisfying.
When seeing the show, I hadn't known Patinkin was reportedly wary of Shakespeare, but it doesn't
surprise me. My initial reaction was that he spent most of the play declaiming the text rather thanperforming or living it. Patinkin is always commanding (he's too fine an actor to avoid that) butonly rarely did I feel the words getting under his skin, as they did for the poignant final speech. Thesurprise here is how well the other actors fared. Usually, in an American production you're lucky toget one or two leads who can speak the text rather than treat it as poetry. The rest of the casttypically mumbles along and the words make no sense to anyone who hasn't read the playintimately and knows the action. But much of the cast here is solid and even though I hadn't readThe Tempest  in years, the action was crystal clear throughout. The young lovers (Stark Sands and
Elizabeth Waterston) were unaffected and charming. (After a rough first scene in which she has toact especially silly, Waterston shines nicely.) The comic relief is bearable, though my guest enjoyedit more than I. And the modest revelation was Ariel, performed by Angel Desai with warmth andhumanity.
Then, of course, there's Caliban (Nyambi Nyambi). Caliban is the black Shylock of Shakespeare's
canon and this production doesn't try to elide or avoid it but simply accepts the ugly attitudes ofProspero as they are. This makes for some of Patinkin's best moments since a straightforward

<p>Michael Giltz: Theater: Tempest Brews Off Broadway
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/theater-emtempestem-brews_b_129351.html [4/5/2009 1:28:46 PM]Tempest  reveals Prospero to be quite a dick: his treatment of Caliban and Ariel is simply
indefensible. Prospero's race-baiting denunciation of Caliban is softened just a tad by having the
black actor Michael Potts play Alonso, but that's it.
It all takes place on a simple square stage. In the first act, a giant pile of sand in the middle of the
floor is a constant reminder of the island setting (perhaps my homeland, Bermuda). A square pieceof "sky" hangs over the stage with some vivid imagery flashing on it and this is raised and loweredby discrete (and in one case quite handsome) stagehands. In repose, it's quite a beautiful image. Asthe storm rages at the beginning, the "sky" dramatically lowers to reveal a small model ship on thebackside with actors roaring around the whole bulky affair to save their lives. Unfortunately, this ispractically the only imaginative use of the background, except for a brief moment when it lowersdown onto an actor in an amusing touch. Similarly, the giant pile of sand the actors walk over isremoved for no good reason in the second act. You spend the second act overly aware of the "sky"and sadly missing the "island" as symbolized by the sand.
Patrick Stewart dominated his Tempest  years ago -- even when he wasn't onstage (which is much
of the show) you felt his presence. When Patinkin reappeared, it was often a modest jolt. I'd joked
beforehand that he would work in a song and darned if there wasn't one, with Patinkin's lovely
distinctive voice cutting through the others with simple grace. Another grace note was a dance,
with the two young lovers seemingly connected by invisible strands. Patinkin might well grow intothe role, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was more effective at the end of the run than he was at thebeginning. But how nice to see even a so-so production of Shakespeare where so many roles areconvincingly played, especially the young lovers and Desai as Ariel. Sometimes an airy spirit canseem the most substantial creature of all.
The other critics:The New York Times'  Charles Isherwood said: "While it brings no revelatory ideas to bear on the
play, Mr. Kulick's production flows naturally to its beneficent conclusion. The tense urgency of Mr.
Patinkin's Prospero subsides gradually, as the achievement of his ends seems to leave him serenelydepleted of will, becalmed at last."
Variety's  Marilyn Stasio says: "Mandy Patinkin has a beautiful voice, as warm and golden as honey
spooned from a jar -- the perfect voice to sing us through "The Tempest," the most musical of
Shakespeare's late plays. Toplined by Patinkin's commanding Prospero, this Classic StageCompany production slips through some earthbound staging constraints to soar on the lyricalwings of the play's poetry. One might carp about certain visuals or cringe from the slapstick
comedy, but what a joy to hear every line enunciated -- and understood -- by a cast whose ears are
attuned to the music of the spoken word."
The New Yorker's  HIlton Als says: "The only actors who seem to connect are Waterston and Sands.
In the lovely scene in Act III when Ferdinand professes his love, we're given a glimmer of what this
production might have been had all the actors interacted: a kind of homage to forgiveness."
The New York Post's  Frank Scheck gave the show 3 out of 4 stars and says: "As the sorcerer
Prospero, [Patinkin] delivers Shakespeare's poetry with lilting vocal cadences and swirling hand
movements in what isn't so much a dramatic performance as a musical recital.... While not exactlymagical, this is a "Tempest" that makes some pretty notes."
The Associated Press's  Jennifer Farrar says: "From the first thunderclap to the final soliloquy, this
"Tempest" is a triumph that will please all lovers of Shakespeare and good theater." She calls the
production "eloquent" and says of Patinkin, "[He] exudes glowering, simmering forcefulness evenin tender moments with Miranda, who is sweetly portrayed with ethereal innocence by ElizabethWaterston. Patinkin doesn't merely act as Prospero, he seems to become Prospero, seething withrepressed rage and hubris at his power and sudden chance for revenge."
Theatermania's  Dan Bacalzo says, "Mandy Patinkin's portrayal of Prospero in Classic Stage
Company's revival of The Tempest is ill-conceived, at best. The actor evidences blatant disregard
for Hamlet's advice to the Players by sawing the air with his hands, and generally indicating hischaracter's intentions. He lowers his voice to growl the majority of his lines, and while his brusquedemeanor is occasionally funny, it also lacks dimension. However, that's not the only problem thatafflicts Brian Kulick's haphazard staging of Shakespeare's grand play. The main difficulty is that theproduction lacks a coherent vision."

And Bloomberg 's John Simon is typically acerbic: "You would never know from the sorry mess on

poetic and humane plays, a final summoning of the master's artistry and philosophy."
