Ballet-Through 4/4. Frederick Wiseman's latest 
documentary employs the usual techniques: a 
leisurely, even indulgent~running timel-a",enspie 
uous absence of voice-overs or explanatory titles; 
and a predilection for long, quietly observant 
scenes. As always, his style is ideally suited to cap­
turing the rhytluns and realities of a world-in this 
case, the American Ballet Theater. Most of it is de­
voted to practice sessions, with the final eighty 
minutes showing the ABT on tour, with perfor­
mance excerpts and scenes of dancers at play.WhiIe 
there is nothing revelatory here, it is engaging and 
fascinating throughout. Newcomers to ballet, en­
tranced by TIre Red Shoes, will come face-to-face 
with endless rehearsals and stern taskmasters. And 
certainly aficionados will find even more to savor. 
Later scenes showing the dancers rela:cing on the 
beach or strolling in parks seem tangential at best, 
but like every other glimpse of these dedicated 
artists, it leaves one thought uppermost in your 
mind: "I need to work out." (2 hrs. 50 min.; NR)

talent who rarely finds movies that can showcase 
her unique charm. While this World War Il-era k,ve 
story isn't particularly noteworthy, at least It gives I 
her a dramatic role of substance . Saegebrecht IS 
\<lartha, the German maid of a prominent , Jewish 
doctor in Czechoslovakia. When the. doctors lovely I 
wife dallies with another man, he divorces her and ' 
rums to the rather plain and submissive Martha as an 
easy substitute. Martha's po~r far:nily is properly de­
lighted by her rich catch while his IS shocked at hav­

bility turns to love Just as the encroachin~Third Re­

Wings of Courage--Dir ector Je:ln-jacques Annaud's 
foray into 3-D Imax is a surpnsll1gly sedate afTa\[ 
Jbo~t French airmail pilots who flew a dangerous 
route over the Andes. After some initial flvmg 
scenes. it settles into :I quiet pattern of shots of 
Craig ShetTer climbing/walking to safery after a 
plane crash alternated with shots of worned loved 
ones safely at home. It's 3-D! Throw some spears at 
us or something , one can't help but think. But~­
naud scrupulously avoids any such pandenng , 
which would be fine if the story were more en­
gaging. It isn't, but the nifty new technology, IS 
marvel enou~h to keep the curious sated. There s a 
real sense ot depth to the picture and audience

to imagine how. Alex comes closest with her desire 
to write and an increasingly intimate relationship 
with a shy but encouraging teacher. Vicki wants to

dom acts of arson. 130th girls have boyfriemls, if

who finds himself sp~~ out of control because 
of drugs is fatally marred by being switched from 
the seventies to the present-Also desperately missed 
from the book is Carroll's overwhelming sense of 
fatalism, which went some ways toward explaining 
why he sought dangerous, momentary escape from 
such an ourwardly appealing life. (Not that one 
needs a reason, but at least it was something to hang 
your hat on.) Without it, this is just a familiar tale 
of a person who hits rock bottom drug-wise and 
then pulls out of it. Leonardo DiCaprio is good, of 
course, as Carroll. But the real surprise here is the 
fine supporting cast, especially Mark (UMarky 
Mark") Wahlberg, who does appear briefly in his 
underwear, and Patrick McGaw, who doesn't but 
hopefully will sometime in the near future. Direct­

trayal of gays in movies. Pool Days,

at a local gym, catching the eye of a 
female instructor and-more to his 
liking, though he can't admit it-a 
good-looking regular (Nick 
Poletti), A Friend of Dorothy; by 
Raoul O'Connell, shows an mno­
cent college srudent hungry for 
intimacy but willing to wait for 
romance. And TI,e Disco Years, writ­
ten and directed by USC grad 
Robert Lee King, caprures the sev­
enties to a tee in the story of Tom 
(Matt Nolan), who haS. to. decide, 
between accepting himself and risk­
ing rejection by his family' ,and 
friends. Angrier and more earnest .,.. . 
than the others, it also manages to boogie' il3 way. 
to a satisfying finale. All are notable first and fore­
most as pn;>mising and entertaining debuts, rather 
than for any strides they may make in advancing 
onscreen portrayals of gays. That's just a bonus.
