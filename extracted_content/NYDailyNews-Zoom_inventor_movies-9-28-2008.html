            <p>ots of people have ideas they think
will change the world, but innovators
sometimes see their brilliant inventions
go awry - or get ripped off by a giant
corporation.
The latter happened to Bob Kearns, whose
story is told in "Flash of Genius," opening Friday.
Keams (played by Greg Kinnear) is the guy who
created the intermittent windshield wioer in the
'60s - and took the big automakers to court
when they stole the idea. Here are six more
Hollywood celebrations of inventors who were
brilliant or bonkers - and sometimes both.
TUCKER:THE MAN
AND HIS DREAM (1988)
Flash of genis: Preston Tucker (Jeff
Bridges) has decided post-Wwll America is
ready for a better car - and he'll build it.
Brcaldhroryh or bomb: Detroit doesn't like
upstarts, and so it squashed Tucker's dream.
This Francis Ford Coppola film is one of his
underappreciated gems, with flash and style to
spare - just like the 48 Tucker sedan.
THE ASTRONAUT FARMER (2006)
Flash of geniu: Just because you had to
retire from NASA to save the family farm is no
reason to give up your dream of space travel. At
least that's the thinking of Billy Bob Thornton's
character, a former astronaut named ... Farmer,o?
.irj sl\
r*' ,il
F ,f' some things weren't meant to be invented, but
.$i tnut ** a luxury they just didn't have.
Brcak0uough or bomb: Farmer's wife,
played by Virginia Madsen, has got his back,
while the FBI is suspicious. Without spoiling
the ending, let's say that just trying to get into
space on your own is a nutty triumph.
FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY(I989)
Flash d genius: Our best and brightest
scientific minds (overseen by Paul Newman's
Gen. Groves) race against the clock to build an
atomic bomb before the Nazis do.
healrftrcugh or bomb: They then see it
used to wipe out a pair of Japanese cities. MaybeTHE HUDSUCKER PRO)0/ 0994)
Flash of genius: The head of a company
(Newman, again) hires a "moron" (Tim Robbins)
to drive the firm into the ground so he and
his cronies can take it over for pennies on the
dollar. Unfortunately, said moron comes up with
a brilliant idea for a new toy.
Ereakftrongfi or bonb: Robbins thinks a
Hula-Hoop-type toy will work. And darned if it
doesn't. Nobody's hated accidental success this
much since "The Producers."
FRANKENSTEIN (1931)
Fhsh of gcnius: Everyone dreams about
defeating death. But Dr. Frankenstein took
it a step further by harnessing the power of
lightning to reanimate a "creature" stitched
together from various bodies.Brcakftrough or bomb: Two words: "lt's
alive!" A definite success, though someone
should have thought about what to do with the
Monster after it came to life.
BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985)
Flash of genius: Time travel is one of
Hollywood's favorite sci-fi devices, but it was
never more entertaining than when Christopher
Lloyd's Doc Brown introduced the flux capacitor.
Brcakhrutgh or bomb: Michael J. Fox's
Marty McFly soon realized the hilarious - and
sometimes creepy - aspects ofjumping back
into the past and meeting your nerdy dad and
randy mom when they were in high school. lt
took two more movies (and probably a lifetime
of therapy for McFly) to straighten it all out. But
it sure was fun. Michael GilE</p>
