MURDER FOR TWO: A MUSICAL COMEDY  **
The New York Musical Theatre Festival  has just drawn to a close and I already miss
it. It featured some 50 different events, including fully staged musicals. I saw 12 of
them (along with a reading of another starring Anthony Rapp) and either I just gotvery lucky in my picks or this year is the best yet for NYMF . Several of their shows
over the years have made their way to Broadway. I wouldn't be surprised at all if oneor two from this year made that same journey. And Off Broadway and regionalproductions are surely in store for more. It's very hard to create a show worthmounting. It's even harder perhaps to go that last mile and turn a promising show intoa great one, but these shows have the right ingredients to make the effort worthwhile.I'll be keeping an eye out for all of these in the future: Bend In The Road, Castle Walk,Crossing Swords, Mata Hari in 8 Bullets  and Volleygirls . I want to see them all again;
to be able to say that about five out of 12 shows is pretty amazing. Now here are my
reviews of the three last shows I caught.
NYMF: BEND IN THE ROAD  *** 1/2
NYMF  AT PEARL THEATRE COMPANY
Anne Of Green Gables  and the many sequels that followed are a beloved series of
books by Lucy Maud Montgomery. (Is there any other way to describe them other
than "beloved"? Well, after one or two fall into a formula -- Anne comes to new townand with her plucky spirit brings lovers together, opens up closed hearts and winseveryone over -- they built on the original's freshness by following its heroine throughlife in a sweet, unaffected manner.)
The story of talkative little orphan Anne Shirley who comes to the rural town of Prince
Edward Island has been adapted into feature films, TV movies, a classic TV series,animated movies, stage plays and of course numerous musicals. One musicalversion is staged every year in Canada and toured the world, including briefly theWest End. I can't speak to it since I've never seen it or heard the cast album. But I'mcertain few versions have so successfully captured the charms of the original the way
Bend In The Road  already does. With some refinements, it surely deserves to make
its way to Broadway, the home of girl-friendly musicals.
And if they're very lucky, it will happen soon enough so that Alison Woods can play
Anne. This young actress has a lovely singing voice and sets just the right tone as thehyper-imaginative, stubborn, but essentially adorable Anne with an "e." But kudos tothe casting of Michael Cassara, who has surrounded her with talented performers justright for this show.
Take the crucial first scene where we really get to know Anne. She's just been
dropped off by train from an orphanage. It's a bit of a screw-up: brother and sisterMarilla and Matthew Cuthbert "ordered" a boy to help them on the farm and suddenlyhere is this red-headed little girl. Of course they have to take her home for the nightand Matthew (Martin Vidnovic) and Anne make the buggy ride home to Green Gableswhile singing "Anne With An E." Matthew is overwhelmed by Anne's non-stop chatter-- he's a farmer, a man of few words who sinks into pleasant silence for hours at atime, one imagines. Anne is all-abuzz; what's this? What's that? Though Matthewsays virtually nothing through the ride, we see him looking abashed, bemused andslowly falling hard for the charms of this willful child. It's a beautiful piece of acting andcrucial to establishing Anne's character. He's matched by Woods, who never
overplays Anne, never going for humor but letting it flow naturally out of her
passionate exclamations. Here in one well-crafted scene (the book is by BenitaScheckel, the music by Michael Upward and they both wrote the lyrics) you get to theheart of the books and what makes them so enduring.May 12, 2014
 This is the print preview:
Back to normal view Â»
Posted: 07/29/2013 4:52 pm</p>
<p>(The video is of an earlier staging that doesn't match the one I saw.)
Director Benjamin Endsley Klein is in full control throughout, aided by strong tech
work, including the scenic design of Lauren Helpern, costumes by David Kaley,lighting by Joel E. Silver and sound by A&L Sound Partners.
Maureen Silliman shines as the busybody neighbor Rachel Lynde. (The actress's
name couldn't be better for playing this character.) Her pushy ways keep Marilla(Anne Kanengeiser) from following her head and instead giving in to her heart. Beforeyou know it, Anne is ensconced at Green Gables and having adventures, whether it'smaking a new best friend with Diana (Whitney Winfield) or sparring with Gilbert (avery appealing CJ Pawlikowski), the smartest, most handsome boy in school.
Strong moments abound. Kanengeiser as Marilla is perhaps the most crucial casting
outside of Anne and she too is pitch perfect, whether making a cutting remark, trying
to remain stern while amused by Anne's outbursts or teaching the child how to pray (a
lovely musical setting for "The Lord's Prayer"). Winfield is a good counterbalance as
Anne's friend and Pawlikowski makes their transition from rivals to friends to potential
lovers perfectly believable. Of course front and center is Woods as Anne and she's adelight, singing beautifully, behaving spunkily and always keeping Anne real. Shemines the humor without ever reaching for it and that makes all the difference.
A late spooky scene and song "The Haunted Wood" is especially well-staged. It
somehow creates a scary, affecting moment with just a little lighting, some effectivemusic and having the cast onstage standing in two lines with their backs to theaudience while Anne lets her over-active imagination scare her for real. It's puretheater, with no need for elaborate effects to achieve its goal. Indeed, Bend In TheRoad  would be most welcome on Broadway for its lack of smoke and mirrors, not to
mention a sweet nature that is heart-warming without being simplistic or treacly.Wholesome doesn't have to mean dumb.
As for what needs work, the finale is a bit rushed. We get high school graduation,
Gilbert taking over as teacher of the school, Marilla deciding to sell the farm, Gilbertgiving up his position so Anne can take it and her remaining in town at Green Gables -- not to mention Gilbert declaring his affections and all of it in about five minutes. it's
hard to feel much tension when Green Gables is put up for sale in one sentence and
rescued in the next. Plus, I missed the growing fondness between Anne and thebusybody Rachel, which we didn't get a chance to see. They go from enemies to palsin one fell swoop and it would be nice to indicate how that happened.
Most crucially, the first and last numbers in the show are radically different from the
direct, winning songs throughout. Both "A Home For Me" and the finale "Bend In TheRoad" (with a reprise of "Walk Like Sisters") are full-on productions featuring theentire cast with multiple characters singing multiple parts often at the same time a laLes Miserables.  Their cluttered arrangements are just as elaborate and overwhelming.
Again and again in the show, winning songs like "Math and Mayhem," "That Girl,""What Do You Call A Boy/Girl" and "Walk Like Sisters" have strong melodies andlyrics that belie their sophistication. They're simple and direct and charming, just likeAnne. So the elaborate opener and finale aren't just unsuccessful in their own rights,they're also counter to the entire spirit of the show. Find the heart of those momentswithout all the grandness of a "big" opening or ending and Bend In The Road  will
have the scene setter and finale this delightful production deserves.
NYMF: VOLLEYGIRLS  *** 1/2
NYMF  AT SIGNATURE THEATRE COMPANY</p>
<p>After the drudgery that was Lysistrata Jones  and Bring It On,  you can forgive people
for being wary of yet another sports-based musical. But Volleygirls  is everything those
shows were not. It's clever, well-written, filled with strong songs and great characters,
well-acted and -- crucially -- presents the sport of volleyball in theatrically clever termsthat don't leave you worried whether an actress who can sing and dance will alsoprove capable of convincingly spiking the ball. If it hadn't been done so poorly sorecently, you might not realize what an accomplishment this winner is.
The set-up is familiar. The female volleyball team may be struggling but temporary
coach Flo Hartline (Jennifer C. Johnson) is still angry to find she's being replaced bythe English teacher Kim Brindell (Susan Blackwell). Turns out Kim is a formerOlympian, a notorious choker who made history the wrong way by catching the
service on match point, losing the tournament and scoring millions of views on
YouTube in the process. Her notoriety was so great that Kim changed her name and
swore off volleyball forever. But the principal (Benjamin Howes) went to college withKim (whose nickname was "The Beast") and he knows she can turn the team around.
First, she has to win over the girls. Their best player is the principal's daughter Katie
(Juliane Godfrey) but she fights with everyone because they think she gets special
treatment and she thinks they all hate her. Marisol (Gerianne Perez) is a lesbian, the
towering Ingrid (Julia Knitel) is too timid to take advantage of her physical gifts,Stretch (Dana Steingold) is the shortest member of the team and dreams of spikingthe ball but usually just offers an amusing quip while cheekily calling all the adults bytheir first names. Will Kim turn the team around? Will Flo undermine her authority,convince the PTA to fire her or tell the world about her Olympic shame? Will Marisoland the red-headed Jocelyn realize they both like each other that way? Will they winthe big game? Do you have to ask? Have you never  seen a sports movie before?
Xavier (PJ Adzima), our way into the game of volleyball. He's assigned to cover theteam and becomes a passionate fan, falling hard for Jess in the process. it seemsrude amongst so many talented women to begin with a man, but truth be told hesteals the show as Xavier, getting in touch with his inner cheerleader, narrating theaction with infectious delight and singing the show's best song, the funny andromantic "You're Beautiful When You Play." If someone is looking to cast The NeilPatrick Harris Story,  you've just found your man.
He's matched by a great cast that brings to life these admittedly familiar and clichedroles with ease. (Kudos to Lindsay Levine and Tara Rubin on the casting.) The smartbook that deftly creates these roles and gives them enough specificity to make them
more than cliches is by Rob Ackerman. The music is by Eli Bolin and the lyrics by
Sam Forman and their songs have a lot of winners, including "This Is Volleyball," "ILike Girls," the act one closer "Jabali," and "This Stupid Game," to name a few.
Ryan Kazprzak does a great job on the choreography, including the clever touches
that let them reenact volleyball games, from the slap of their hands that signal a ballhas been served to the rousing dances that show them coming together as a team.Bringing it all together is director Neil Patrick Stewart, who has delivered a genuinecrowd-pleaser with heart.
You can't fault the acting. It's very strong, with Steingold especially funny in comic
relief, Perez winning in the this-side-of-cliche role of the fiery Latina and Godfreyhitting the right level of anger in her role as the disaffected Katie. She never overplaysher anger and so it's both convincing and all the more touching when she givesground. The villain of the piece is Flo and Johnson is terrifically good. Again, she's</p>
<p>never a cartoon villain. The book doesn't make her unreasonably hateful or motivated
by some stupid animus; she's just a misguided mom with misguided priorities for her
child. That makes her all the more scary and Johnson really knocks it out of the parkwith her big number "Animal In Our Midst."
I really enjoyed the cast as is and their chemistry is crucial to the show's success.
However, it must be noted that Blackwell and Howes are not the strongest singers.Blackwell is devoted to education and encouraging creativity in her many projects  so
she clearly feels the drive to teach in her bones. Godfrey, as Katie, is also not abelter. Their acting carries much of the show's drama, but when they duet or sing as atrio towards the end of act one (on "The Beast That You Used To Be" and "I'm InHell") one can see room for improvement in that area.
Does it belong on Broadway? As far as quality is concerned, if those two earlier
shows went there it surely does. But it's a shame the economics of Off Broadway
can't be worked out so that a show ideally suited to a small venue with a fresh-faced
cast of newcomers like this could be financially successful and run for ages.
Wherever it ends up, you'll discover a talented creative team to keep an eye on and a
lot of appealing performers.
NYMF: HOMO THE MUSICAL  no stars
NYMF  AT PEARL THEATRE COMPANY
This witless musical offers a broad satire of suburbia: a happy family of seeming
Ozzie and Harriet wholesomeness is soon revealed to be riddled with hypocrisy andsexual desire. The preacher father -- who laboriously counsels to be afeard of "thedevil's hole," the anus -- is of course a closet case who fantasizes about sex withJesus. (That might be scandalous if it were remotely amusing.) Mom pops pills; theson is also gay and the daughter slaughters her schoolmates when they reject her.They already seem ripe for an American Beauty -style meltdown, but an alien comes
down to supplant mom and push everyone to revel in their true natures.
The book by Lola Rock-N-Rolla and lyrics by Gina Volpe (who also did the music)
traffic in the most tired cliches. When the preacher is so transparent and bizarre as to
talk about "holy douches" it's really not so remarkable to have him revealed as
wanting to practice what he preaches against. It's directed capably enough by David
Drake. But the scenic design and projections by Jason Lee Courson and thecostumes by Karl Ruckdeschel take their cues from the book and songs and go forthe most obvious gags every step of the way.
Despite these dire circumstances, it's still possible to see the talented people involved
doing their best. The melodies by Volpe are the strongest part of the musical andhave a genuine kick (thanks to a solid band including Jason Bozzi on guitar). As thedaughter Suzie, Blair Goldberg has some funny moments, especially when shedeclares she's a mass murderer and her parents can only talk about their son beinggay. As Billy (and other characters), J. Alexander Coe is an affable presence with abemused outlook and sexy appeal. As the object of his affection, ChristopherTrepinski certainly offers a lot to lust after. Eric Gunhus anchors the show as thenarrator and for a moment makes you believe it might actually be better than it seems.
But with paper tigers as its targets and an utterly conventional attitude to the world as
hidebound as the one it believes it is satirizing, what can talented actors do? They will
all hopefully appear in something better very soon.
MURDER FOR TWO: A MUSICAL COMEDY  **
2ECONDSTAGE THEATRE
This two-hander is dead simple in its conception and has unsurprisingly been touring
the country for a while before making its New York City debut. Murder is afoot in thismusical comedy and a would-be detective is called in to sort through all the suspectsand discover the killer. The twist is that the police man Marcus is played by one actor(in this case the very charming Brett Rybeck) and all the others are played by another(the inexhaustible Jeff Blumenkrantz).
Both are composers in their own right and both actors jump on the piano to provide
musical accompaniment when the other is singing. Props for the board game Clue areon display in the set designed by Beowulf Boritt, who also displays a silhouette of thegrand home that is the show's setting in a clever way. That's about it for clevertouches. Otherwise, we're given a predictably eccentric cast of characters and twoactors who have fun jumping around the stage while goofing with the audience,playing off of each other and occasionally moving the plot forward as we slowly figureout who-dun-it.</p>
<p>(Photo by Joan Marcus)
Joe Kinosian did the music, Kellen Blair did the lyrics and they both wrote the book.
Nothing is remarkably new here, so it's a pity they didn't push themselves further. Toooften, they avoid the challenge of crafting a genuinely funny murder mystery and justfall back on the fact that it's being played by two actors rather than say eight. Jokesbreaking down the fourth wall and calling attention to the stunt in progress abound. Ifthe show did work with a full cast (and frankly, it would be unwatchable if staged thatway), then it would be even better when imaginatively performed by just two. Theyhave it exactly the wrong way around.
Luckily, they did get one thing right: the casting of the two leads. Blumenkrantz and
Ryback are very good in their respective parts, with Blumenkrantz scoring especially
strongly as a young female student falling in love with our hero. Ryback for his part
has charm to spare. Most importantly, their chemistry with each other is excellent.
Still, there's something very notable about the fact that the highlight of the show is nota song by the composers or some clever staging or the final revelation but simplywatching these two talented men joke with each other at the beginning and end whileriffing wordlessly on the piano.
