4 | FEBRUARY 6, 2022For our full list of the 101 best mystery novels of all time, head to 
Parade.com/mysteries . And check out Parade.com/thrills  for 111 of 
the greatest thriller and suspense novels ever.1 Winter’s Bone  by Daniel 
W oodrell  Before Jennifer Lawrence 
starred as an Ozark teen in the Holly -
wood adaptation, Winter’s Bone  
was a hit, according to James 
Patterson  (whose novel with 
Dolly Parton, Run, Rose, Run,  is 
out March 7). “It’s rare, maybe 
a 100,000 to 1 shot, that a novel will 
succeed on every level—story, char -
acters, dialogue and description that 
rises to the level of poetry. But that’s 
what Woodrell achieved here.” 
2 A Judgement in Stone by 
Ruth Rendell  “You know the victims, 
killer and motive from the first 
sentence,” says author Donna 
Leon  (her latest Brunetti mys -
tery, Give Unto Others , is out 
March 15). “But the reader 
spends the next 300 pages hoping to 
prevent these poor lambs from lead -
ing themselves to the slaughter.”
3 True Grit by Charles Portis  
Author Jasper Fforde  (The Constant 
Rabbit ) says this stone-cold 
classic (narrated by an un -
forgettable 14-year-old girl) 
belongs in the celebration of 
thrillers: “A revenge story, manhunt, thriller and a story of trust, love, brav -
ery and tenacity— True Grit  has it all.”
4 A Perfect Spy by John le Carré  
No one writes espionage like le Carré, 
says The Bone Collector  author 
Jeffery Deaver . “I’ve picked 
A Perfect Spy  because it is 
also one of the most engross -
ing and harrowing portraits of a 
father-son relationship I’ve ever read.”
5 The Talented Mr. Ripley by 
Patricia Highsmith  It is one of the 
best (if not the best) thrillers of all 
time, says Karin Slaughter , 
whose latest novel, Girl, For -
gotten , hits shelves later this 
year. “Tom Ripley is not just 
a classic antihero, he is a pre -
cursor to so many flawed men we’re 
meant to root for, from Don Draper to 
Tony Soprano.”
6 Live and Let Die by Ian 
Fleming  For author Ken Follett 
(Never ), this second entry in the 
James Bond series—more 
brutal and blunt than the 
films—leads the thriller 
pack. “I remember asking my 
father what a martini was,” Follett

 6      THE MOST 
             READS EVER
says. “‘Some kind of drink,’ he said grumpily, clearly 
having no idea. I could hardly wait to find out.”
7 Room by Emma Donoghue  The darkest 
novels don’t plunge us into depravity but shine a 
light so we can confront them. That’s why Room  
captured the imagination of bestselling au -
thor Kristin Hannah  (Firefly Lane , The Four 
Winds ). “It’s quite simply one of the most 
powerful, most beautiful novels I’ve ever 
read,” she says. “It’s one of those stories 
that lingers and makes you see the world in a 
slightly different way.”
