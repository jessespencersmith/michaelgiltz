What We Say
This novel -- ostensibly for kids, but gripping enough for anyone with a heart -- is disarmingly simple. It tells the eternal,
universal story of refugees, of people fleeing for their lives and desperately seeking shelter. Author Alan Gratz tells threeparallel stories from three eras. In present day Syria, a Muslim family leaves their bombed-out apartment building to start
the dangerous trek to Germany. In 1939 Germany, a Jewish family flees Hitler's stranglehold via a ship headed to Cuba. And
in 1995 Cuba, a family plunges onto a leaky, makeshift raft when Castro unexpectedly says anyone who wants to try toreach America is free to go. Young teens are at the center of each story and every tale involves hardship, sacrifice, terrorShare This Book
