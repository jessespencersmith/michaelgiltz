            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  M A R C H  2 1 ,  2 0 0 6Beatles Travesty, Vol. 2I'm a fanatic Beatles fan, but not an unreasonable soul. So believe mewhen I say The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 was one of the most shoddilypackaged boxed sets for a major artist I have ever seen. It came in aflimsy, cheap cardboard box mimicking the "longbox" format popular15 years ago. The four CDs themselves came in pseudo-LP jackets alsovery cheaply made without any album listings on the spine. All four ofthem were housed in a super-cheap cardboard slipcase that folded backonto itself so it could at least be housed in the same space as regularCDs -- except it too had no info on its spine, so if you placed it on yourbookcase alongside other Beatles albums, it offered just a generic,blank front that gave you no clue as to what it actually contained. MostBeatles bootlegs are put together with far more care. This was the firstsonic upgrade since the Beatles debuted on CD in the '80s, making itLONG overdue. So I bought the junky, insulting packaging to get thesongs -- which are presented in the same order as their original USreleases. Thank God for iPod; I just took the newly remastered songsand plugged them into the original album order as much as possible.The outcry over such a pathetic release was universal, so now Capitol isreleasing Vol. 2 on April 11...and apparently doing it just as cheaply thesecond time around. Well done! Only a true idiot could mess upsomething as sure fire as a "new" release by the Beatles.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
