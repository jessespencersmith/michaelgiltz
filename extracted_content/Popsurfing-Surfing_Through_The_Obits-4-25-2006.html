            <p>T U E S D AY,  A P R I L  2 5 ,  2 0 0 6Surfing Through The ObitsI love reading obituaries and today's NYTimes has two good ones. Thefirst is about William Gottlieb, the jazz photographer who capturedlegends like Billie Holiday and Miles Davis at their peak. Whateverimage springs to mind when you think of them, chances are Gottliebsnapped it. But this is the passage that caught my eye:In 1941, he quit his advertising job to do graduate study ineconomics and teach low-level classes at the University ofMaryland, but continued his column. He said he left theuniversity after it refused to let him teach a course on jazz, forfear it would overly praise black people.Then there's a piece on actress Alida Valli (who starred in "The ThirdMan") which has this head-spinning transition:Rather than comply with the dictates of the fascist government,Ms. Valli retreated into hiding and in 1944 married Oscar deMejo, a Surrealist painter and composer, whose most successfulsong was "All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth."Life doesn't get quirkier than that.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
