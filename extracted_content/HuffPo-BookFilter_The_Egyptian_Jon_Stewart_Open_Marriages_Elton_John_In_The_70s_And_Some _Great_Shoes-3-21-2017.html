<p>THE TEA GIRL OF HUMMINGBIRD LANE by Lisa See
China is such a huge nation encompassing so many different ethnic groups and cultures that it's almost 
mind-boggling. Best-selling author Lisa See shared the lives of the Yao people in Snow Flower and The Secret Fan. Now she brings to life the Akha via the story of the defiant and rule-breaking Li-yan, who embraces 
modernity but can't help wondering about the child she gave up for adoption to a couple in the land of California ..... Read More.

CAPTAIN FANTASTIC by Tom Doyle
Elton John's live version of "Candle In The Wind" is playing on the radio while I write this newsletter in a diner 
in New York City. Given his remarkable run of hits, there's probably always a song of Elton's playing</p>
<p>somewhere in the world today, almost 50 years after he shot to fame with "Your Song" in 1971. He's had ups 
and downs, naturally, but now he's an institution. That might lead you to forget what an outrageous and remarkable figure he was in the 1970s. This new biography by a noted UK journalist focuses on that wooly decade, from the marriage to the drugs to stadium tours to the crazy glasses to the time Elton announced he was bisexual and almost derailed everything. Oh, and the songs, the endless string of hits (one hit a year every
 
year for 40 years in a row!) that ultimately kept him on top no matter what he said or did.... Read More.

THE ARRANGEMENT by Sarah Dunn
Best-selling author Sarah Dunn made her bones on the classic sitcom Murphy Brown, going on to be a top 
creative on shows like Spin City and Veronica's Closet. So it's no surprise her latest romantic novel has lots of  
laughs and seems ready for the silver screen. A young and happy couple moves to the suburbs and makes a life with their autistic son and satisfying careers and healthy lifestyles. It's all...ok, a little boring. Still, when friends announce they're now in an open marriage, this couple is aghast and confused and...intrigued. They'd never...but maybe just for six months? Just to see?..... Read More.

<p>REVOLUTION FOR DUMMIES by Bassem Youssef  
"The Egyptian Jon Stewart" is the sort of shorthand any TV comic would be proud to embrace. But Bassem 
Youssef made the wrong sort of headlines when his incendiary satirical TV series (modeled on The Daily Show ) 
led the Egyptian government to decide Youssef was a spy for the CIA. His show was cancelled and he fled the country fearing -- reasonably enough -- for his life. But this book is more than just a memoir. It's an inside look at the Arab Spring, the craziness of life under a dictatorship where the media is the enemy of the powerful(sound familiar?) and what's next for the Middle East. Youssef is touring the US right now .... Read More.

LOLA by Melissa Scrivner Love</p>
<p>LA's South Central has many gangs and the Crenshaw Six are just looking to survive. That is until they start to 
gain some real power. They look like any other gang except their leader Garcia is not really their leader. The power behind the throne is  his girlfriend Lola, the chick you don't really pay attention to, not really. But she's 
the one pulling the strings, deciding strategy and willing to do absolutely anything to get ahead. Playing the submissive babe let's her listen and learn -- and if it also keeps her safer, all the better. But playing it safe can only get you so far and Lola wants to go farther.... Read More.

NO ONE CARES ABOUT CRAZY PEOPLE by Ron Powers
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist (Flags Of Our Fathers) delivers his most personal book yet in this work that 
combines the history of mental health care in the US combined with the story of his two sons battling schizophrenia. You'll be fascinated by this look at how poorly we dealt with mental illness in the past, frustrated by the idiocy of the system today and drawn in by what it's like when those "crazy people" are your own kids....

<p>MISSISSIPPI BLOOD by Greg Iles  
The final book in an acclaimed, best-selling trilogy that straddles the line between thriller and literary fiction. 
Greg Iles tops  himself with a courtroom finale that finds Mayor Penn Cage frustrated by his father's silence 
even as his dad faces trial for murder. Cage uncovers a long-lost brother his dad had with a black nurse, links to a vicious spin-off of the KKK, and an infamous assassination from the 1960s that might just tie it all together. Cage wants to exonerate his father and convict the guilty but he starts to fear that both of those things can't be possible.... Read More.

MANOLO BLAHNIK: THE ART OF SHOES by Cristina Carrillo de Albornoz Fisac
Shoes. Either you just wear them or you worship them. In this coffee table book, the shoes of Blahnik are</p>
<p>celebrated while he discusses his inspirations, his muses, the other designers he admires and more. You get 
sketches and glam shots of Blahnik's work and it's all tied into an exhibit of more than 200 of his best works. They can be seen in museums all over the world, including Toronto in 2018.... Read More.
