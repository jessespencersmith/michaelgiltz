            <p>T U E S D AY,  M A R C H  3 1 ,  2 0 0 9The IRA's 2009: Spreading The Wealth AroundIn 2008, the IRA movie awards were swept to an unprecedented degreeby the terrific, acclaimed but generally overlooked film TheAssassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford. In 2009, astrong lineup of well-regarded movies and a desire to avoid anothersweep guaranteed that the IRA awards were spread among a range offilms from blockbusters like The Dark Knight to tiny flicks like Ballastand Shotgun Stories.The IRAs is an annual get-together of movie buffs that was launched bycollege friends 33 years ago as a counter to the more mundane Oscars.These are film fanatics who go to Film Forum and Anthology Archivesand film festivals throughout America and around the world. Membershave won major Oscars and worked on Oscar-winning Best Picturewinners, they've written acclaimed and best-selling Hollywoodbiographies like Ed Sikov's Dark Victory: The Life Of Bette Davis, thedefinitive Oscar book (indeed the definitive awards book) Inside Oscar,by Mason Wiley & Damien Bona; worked at major magazines andnewspapers covering the industry; worked at major studios and in theindependent film industry or in my case just schlepped around as afreelancer and watched a lot of movies year in and year out. In otherwords, IRA members range from major players to avid fans.So here are this year's winners followed by the balloting as it happenedwith all the top vote-getters listed and the Bronx cheers at the end ofSominex and Dramamine movies (those that put us to sleep or made ussick) and Mechanical Actor and Actress. Watch the Best Picturehonorees or the winners from past years (listed at the bottom) andyou'll have a great overview of cinema in the past three decades.BEST PICTURE: The Edge Of HeavenBEST DIRECTOR: Fatih Akin - The Edge Of HeavenBEST ACTOR: Michael Shannon - Shotgun StoriesBEST ACTRESS: Anamaria Marinca - 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 DaysBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR: Emile Hirsch - MilkBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Hanna Schygulla - The Edge OfHeavenBEST SCREENPLAY: Fatih Akin - The Edge Of HeavenNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
