 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Close Up Space  Wastes
Talented David Hyde Pierce
CLOSE UP SPACE  * out of ****
NY CITY CENTER
The opening scene of Molly Smith Metzler's comedic
play Close Up Space  is the only good scene. But in
fairness it does briskly and efficiently introduce our
main character, his perspective on the world and his
troubles in this new production by Manhattan TheatreClub.
The marvelous actor David Hyde Pierce is Paul, an
editor at a boutique publishing house and he's lecturing us on editing by using plaintive emails from
various heads of boarding schools as samples to dissect. Pierce deftly reduces these desperate pleas tocome pick up his rebellious daughter (who is wandering campus naked and pulling off this or thatunfortunate shenanigan) by red-lining them and eliminating the redundancies, poor grammar andrambling tone. It's funny, tight and delivers a lot of information.
From this opening, we learn Paul is an old school publishing editor (though in the slow-to-adapt world of
publishing, his use of an overhead projector might seem daringly modern). He's precise and dedicated to
his work. He doesn't suffer fools gladly. And his daughter is either troubled or a free spirit but definitely a
handful.
Even this scene misses a joke. When the new intern he's lecturing tries to talk about the software she can
use, Pierce says it certainly didn't help her write a coherent cover letter and shows the editing it  needed, a
nice visual gag. We immediately wonder why she got the job (out of 140 applicants)? If she'd asked,Pierce might have whipped out letters even more heavily red-lined or perhaps a pile of shreddeddocuments and said, "This was the competition." It hardly matters, given the confused nature ofeverything that follows.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>The intern Bailey (Jessica DiGiovanni) makes no sense on any level. She can't speak intelligently,
immediately starts pining for the chips and soda available at some other publishing house and blatherson to the house's top writer during a meeting when she was told to remain quiet. (Bailey compliments thewriter on her choice of font, when Bailey was just told the writer uses an antique typewriter, leading us to
believe Bailey is a complete idiot.) Ultimately her character is so superfluous that at one point she is
simply sent home for the day and never heard from again.
Even more tiresome is the "wacky" receptionist Steve (Michael Chernus) who is literally camping out in
the office because his dog has shown affection for Steve's roommate. This goof somebody's relative orfriend; he needs a job and is somehow forced on Paul. Steve makes nutty jokes and isn't remotely
believable on any level but at least he's an identifiable cliche (the oddball life-force). Rosie Perez brings
her considerable charms and distinctive voice to Vanessa Finn Adams, a high maintenance best-selling
author. She's both terribly demanding and a sweetheart who has a thing for Paul. Adams is both streetsavvy and high falutin', sassy and Shakespeare-quotin' at the same time.
But not even she can challenge Paul's teenage daughter for sheer unlikeliness. Harper (Colby Minifie) is
an 18 year old teen who shouts out Russian at the top of her voice for endless stretches of the show
because her mother committed suicide, Paul sent her away to boarding school and she feels exiled. Hence
the Russian, which she speaks so fluently that Harper translates poems into English during her spare
time. It's an idea so heavy-handed and a conceit so labored in its whimsy that Wes Anderson would avoidit.
This child terrorizes Paul, brings in a crack team of anarchists to strip his office completely of every item
and refuses to speak English for far longer than you would imagine. Oddly, Minifie is far more passionateand believable when shouting out Russian. When she (finally) speaks in English, Minifie adapts anexceptionally deliberate, odd cadence; perhaps she's trying to make sense of the story.
The even odder touch is that the fine office set by Todd Rosenthal slides off stage after Harper had the
room stripped by her unseen associates. But it remains in the wings, a lurking presence. One assumes itwill slide back into place at some point -- else why have it there in plain sight? But in fact it too has beenbanished and without even the decency of a divider or wall or even a curtain to shield the now abandonedset from our view. We literally stare at it just out of the actors' reach for the rest of the play, a scenicchoice one struggles to understand.
I wouldn't judge anyone's acting in a play like this so I'll pass over most of the cast in silence. Rosie Perez
and David Hyde Pierce have a fun chemistry at moments; they're an unlikely couple it's fun to see
together, however brief and confused their scenes may be. Pierce actually holds the show together in away with his considerable skill, though by the end he is jumping around to try and shake some life intothis mess. Even the finale is misjudged, wasting a modest visual flourish by slamming home the obviousfact that Paul and Harper will come closer together.
The poster makes no sense, by the way. They've used an editing notation that indicates the space between
the first two words in the title Close Up Space  should be eliminated; according to the markings, they
should be one word. But no. "Close up" can be two words. Close-up can be hyphenated. But "closeup" isnonsense. They should have placed the notation below the title and placed it between the picture of Pauland Harper , indicating that the emotional space between them  should be "closed up" and they should
rediscover their love, not the space between the two words which is right and proper. They even get theediting wrong.

Speaking of getting the editing wrong: you really need an editor, Michael! 
There are far too many grammatical errors in your review.
01:38 AM on 12/23/2011
You're quite right and thanks for the heads-up. No editors here. It can all be blamed on
me. Normally I post and then read it over again to catch errors. It's easier to edit whenreading the final format rather than the backroom format we deal with. But with family
visiting I was pressed and rushed. Plus I must confess it's no fun to write a pan when
you're not mean-spirited. It's hard to expend energy on something that everyone involves
already knows doesn't work. I've tightened it a little and caught the incorrect spelling of
write/right. So thanks.

When you have two world class actors in your production (Mr.Hyde-Pierce and Ms.Perez) youshould take the trouble for coherent set design. That's all I can say about this.Recency   | Popularity
