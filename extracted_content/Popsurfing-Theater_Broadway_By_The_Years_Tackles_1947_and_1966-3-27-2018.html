THEATER: "BROADWAY BY THE YEAR(S)"
TACKLES 1947 AND 1966
BROADWAY  BY  THE  YEAR:  1947  AND  1966
THE  TOWN  HALL
The 18th season of Broadway  By  The  Year  shows this celebration of
musical theater in fine fettle. Creator and impresario Scott Siegel has
tweaked the format yet again. This season each show is celebratingtwo years from Broadway history. On March 26, Act One includedsongs from 1947 while Act Two focused on 1966.
Yet some things never change: the Monday night event  features stars
from Broadway and cabaret, young talent appearing in smaller shows
and fresh-off-the-bus kids in the ensemble. You always see a favorite
actor, hear a tune or two you never knew before and discover artists
whose names you want to write down so you can catch whatever theydo next. Happily, this strong outing delivered precisely that.
After the usual niceties (including Siegel's smattering of trivia about
the year in question -- and who knew the Russians reached the moon
first, albeit an unmanned mission!), he revealed Act One would focusprimarily on that year's two big hits: Finian's  Rainbow  and
Brigadoon . This suggested an almost Encores-like approach to the
evening, but Broadway  By  The  Year  isn't quite doing that. Still, five
songs from Finian  and four from Brigadoon  gave a healthy taste of
those successes. Interspersed in the middle was the comic gem "TheGentleman Is A Dope" from a rare Rodgers and Hammerstein flop,Allegro . Act Two was more diverse, with ten songs from six different
shows.
My quick take-away? I'd love to see a production of I  Do!  I  Do!  and I
want to see more of Jenny Lee Stern and Tony Yazbeck in anything.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>Siegel is always and admirably touting young talent. Tonight's ingénue
was Mia Gerachis,  who was given a generous three solos: "How Are
Things In Glocca Morra?," "Where Am I Going?" and the question
mark-free song "There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This."
Gerachis has a fine voice, good enough to make clear why she'ssnagged attention. Yet she's performing  every song and we're too
aware of the choices she is making. The sound of her voice had
precedent over the meaning of the words. It will take time and
seasoning to see if Siegel's faith can be rewarded.
Loyalty to newcomers and fan favorites alike is a mainstay of BBTY ,
an essential element since you're cajoling stars of cabaret and
Broadway to do yet another show on their night off essentially for the
love of it. Hence the return of the popular Sal Viviano, who had twoballads but scored best in an acoustic duet on "There But For You GoI" with Eddie Korbich that the crowd went crazy for.
Korbich is a second banana type, the sort of talented pro who would
have worked nonstop back in 1947. He goofed on "When I'm Not Near
The Girl I Love," tossed off multiple accents and had the crowd singingalong to "Go Home With Bonnie Jean," enjoyed some of the loudestapplause of the night with that "look ma, no microphone!" duet withViviano and ended with a solid "Father Of The Bride." Think NorbertLeo Butz.
In contrast, the broad and funny Lesli Margherita  was too eager to
please this night, underlining the jokes in "The Gentleman Is A Dope"
and absolutely steam-rollering over them in the show-stopper
"Gorgeous" from The  Apple  Tree.  She began at over-the-top and then
went higher and higher but the result was we never got to enjoy the
fun. Margherita had left us far behind. She was good fun in 
Dames  At
Sea on Broadway  and won an Olivier Award in the UK so I know she
can and will do better.
Broadway star Betsy Wolfe  however was fairly new to me. I wouldn't
judge anyone on the anonymous girlfriend role she tackled in Bullets
Over  Broadway.  And I missed her during Wolfe's run in Waitress . So
this was my first chance to see her up close and it was a treat. Her
lovely rendition of "Look To The Rainbow" was so gentle the pleased
audience almost forgot to applaud. And she soared with the comictune "You've Got Possibilities" from 
It's  A  Bird!...It's  A  Plane!...It's
Superman!  Wolfe made our host Siegel the object of her makeover
intentions and it worked a charm.
I had no doubts about Tony Yazbeck, having seen him repeatedly to
great effect on Broadway, especially a revival of On  The  Town.  In Act
One he had two big numbers. Yazbeck swung "Old Devil Moon" nicely
and then brought down the curtain with a performance of "AlmostLike Being In Love" that combined singing and tapping with pizazz --
his ability to tap and tap and tap and then go right into a big vocal
moment without a pause for breath was especially impressive. If there►  April (6)

<p>was any problem with Act Two, it was the fact that Yazbeck only came
back for the group finale "It's Today."
But Jenny Lee Stern  satisfied when she opened the show, had the
eleven o'clock number and made the entire evening worth it just for
her performances alone. Resplendently pregnant, Stern introduced herchild-to-be to the world of theater by making the kid a humorouspartner in a performance of "Necessity." Stern's headpiece alone held
your attention, but her terrific voice kept the humor rooted in her
character's predicament. She one-upped that by nailing the dramatichigh point of Mame  where the title character sings "If He Walked Into
My Life," giving Eydie Gormé's classic rendition a run for its money inthe process.
Yet that was nothing compared to her thrilling performance of the title
song from Cabaret . Sure, it's a masterpiece, but it's also been done
brilliantly by numerous stars (not least Liza) and also been done todeath. Overly familiar songs like this can be a double-edged sword.
Not for Stern. She immediately claimed our attention with a peerless
vocal, paced it beautifully, kept the character and story behind it inmind so the song made sense dramatically (even if we hadn't beenwatching a production of Cabaret  leading up to this moment) and set
off fireworks by the end. The only way Stern could have topped itwould have been by giving birth on stage for an encore. That didn't
happen but I wouldn't put it past her.
Happily, Siegel keeps giving birth to more shows at The Town Hall ,
Feinstein's at 54 Below  (including a Sinatra tribute on April 5th ) and
other New York City venues, including another Broadway By The Year
on May 21 and the season finale on June 18 both at The Town Hall.
