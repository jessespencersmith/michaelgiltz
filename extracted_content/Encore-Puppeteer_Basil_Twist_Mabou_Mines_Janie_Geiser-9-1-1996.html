Imagine what it would be like to see a birthday, l\vist's grandmother gave him the 
movie for the very first time. That sense string puppets his bte grandfather used in 
of revelation--of an entirely new art his act as a bandleader. Later that year, ~n a 
form bursting trip to New 
with possibility York, Twist's 
and enchanr- mom wran-
ment-will 
soon be felt by 
thousands of 
people: "Puppet 
virgins" in the 
words of pup­
peteer Janie 
Ceiser. 
The 1996 
International 
Festival of Puppet Theatre, presented by 
the Jim Henson Foundation , is not your 
father's Howdy Doody. Seen here previous­
ly in 1992 and 1994, the Festival now 
encompasses over 140 perfom1ances by 22 
troupes at five theatres. Naturally, New 
York artists will be amply represented. 
Here's a glimpse at three of the Big Apple's 
best. 
Basil Twist: Behind The Scene 
\ Vhen B;1sil '1 \\'ist pert<)J"IllS his 0l1e-II1;111 
piece, "The An111eidae Sho\\' ,mel Other 
Pieces," he's curled up behind his set, hid­
den from the audience's vicw, using CVCI'\"­
thing he cm-his h;lnds, his fL:et, his hips­
to manipulat e puppets, change scenery, 
move around props and bring ,1 stor~' to life. 
"If! could wiggle my ears, maybe 1 could it 
put in some more tricks," he says. 
How did he get into this position: 
Seventeen years ago, Twist got a triple 
dose of the magic of puppetry. For his tenth 
" The Araneidae Show" 
photo by.Bobby Miller gled a visit to 
the headquar­
ters of 
Muppet mas­
ter Jim 
Henson. 
But the big 
event, that 
same trip, was 
when his fam­
ily went to see the great French puppeteer 
Philippe Genty perfonn, albeit to a near 
empty theatre. "It was very French, very 
existential," he recalls. "In one piece, he 
came out with a clown puppet, the typical 
sad French clown. And the puppet looked 
up ;md saw he was a puppet and was so dis­
o'aught he decided he would break the 
strings. Ami he reached up and pulled and 
broke orf all his strings and collapsed in a 
hC;IP Oil the 110m. I'd only scen the 
.\lupIJets basicall!', so it was nothing like I'd 
seen before." 
C:oll1pletek fascill;lted, Twist went back 
the nnt night 'Inti his fate was sealed. Since 
then, he's studied hard-in Paris and 
Atbnt;l-and \\'orked anywhere he could. 
Since 1l10ving here four years ago, he's plied 
his magic on the streets, in nightclubs, Off­
Broadway and with othe: puppeteers. 
However, for the 50-rninute- long "The 
Araneidae (pronounced R-N-A-day) 
ENCORE f&</p>
<p>.1 
~ants to be: Out of the spotlight. 
"When I was a child I was really shy, and 
I know that I took up puppetry because I 
could hide and still impress people," he 
says, laughing. "And it's still that way. You 
won't see me at all until I come out for a 
bow at the end. I like that kind o(pup­
petry-I like the illusion and the 
magic when people don't know 
how you did it." 
Mabou Mines: 
Back To Barrie 
Although 
inspired Mabou 
Mines to tackle thp 
much-loved, 
much -in te rpreted 
tale of Peter Pan, their "Peter 
and Wendy" is designed, much like 
James Barrie's classic book, to speak to par­
ents, even more so than their offspring . 
leV/hen we first started thinking of 
doing it in 1989, our set designer, Julie 
Archer had just had a baby and m)' son was 
five," says adapter/producer Lisa Lorwin. 
"Being a parent, you get to be in your own 
childhood again, and then you have to lose 
it all uver again when your child grows up. 
That's why the story had a great deal of 
intensit\, at that moment." 
To capture that lyric intensity, "Peter 
,lI1d \ \'end~ '" combines traditional Japanese 
hunraku puppetr\I (in which three people 
operate each char'lcter and a separate per­
son acts as narrator) with shadow puppetry, 
children's action figures and a score by 
Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham. 
~ SEPTEMBER performances , notably at Spoleto, those 
expecting Mary Martin or Robin Williams 
may be a bit surprised. "It was interesting to 
watch children with parents, because some­
times the parents would begin to look a lit­
tle nervous when they were suddenly aware 
it wasn't 'Peter Pan,'" she says. "This is 
adult theatre. It's not about big, sweep­
ing, fast-paced adventure." 
Janie Geiser: Finder of Evidence 
"People are really quiet when they see 
it," says Janie Geiser of her award-win­
ning "Evidence of Floods," a noirish 
tale of a woman fleeing her abusive hus­
and. "They almost feel like they have to 
walk quietly," 
Unlike traditional staged 
works, "Evidence of Floods" 
consists of eight different sets scat­
tered around a darkened room-this one at 
Dance Theater Workshop-with pools of 
blue lights as the only illuminati on. 
Audiences file from set to set, where the 
individual puppeteers perform their scene 
over and over again, as a taped score plays 
in the background. 
"It becomes this kind of Zen thing and 
something new happens every time," she 
says, ~With puppets, as well as people, you 
can't predict every move they make." 
With its serious subject maner and sub­
tle allusions (the cop chasing the woman 
whistles that infamou:;. Robert Mitchum 
tune from "The Night of the HWlter"), 
"Evidence" is certainly a far cry from 
"Sesame Street." That makes it doubly 
wonderful, she says, that the Henson 
Foundation is presenting it. 
"A new 'ludiellce fur puppetry is grow­
ing because of this festival," she says. "It's 
brought visibility to the form. I tell them, 
'It's really worked.'" i.-
