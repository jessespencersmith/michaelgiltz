SAMUEL & ALASDAIR: A PERSONAL HISTORY
OF THE ROBOT WAR  ** 1/2 out of ****
THE NEW OHIO THEATRE
This inventive work doesn't have quite enough emotional
heft to take it to the next level. But it's clever and fun
and the individual elements and cast are strong enough to make you glad you saw it and want to see theirnext work. The story is multi-layered but quite simple, really. It takes place in a pirate radio stationapparently in the former Soviet Union. Four people have come together to put on their weekly radio showin broken English. That show contains a story -- their favorite  story -- set in America about two brothers
who love the same girl back in an earlier, simpler time. One of the brothers is a star quarterback and hasit all. The other is quieter and weaker and prone to visions of alien attacks.
Soon we realize that in this world the alien invasion depicted in the radio drama War Of The Worlds
really took place and that much of the US was wiped out right away and the rest of the world is being
mopped up. Thanks to power outages and the desperate hope in their eyes when they ask people to call
in, it's clear these people may be some of the last survivors...but not for long.
The four actors relish their dual roles featuring thickly accented Russian in the present and magically
accent-free English when they're performing the radio play. Michael Dalto has a mostly silent role as amusician. Stephanie Wright Thompson plays the woman who is the object of affection both for the farmboys in the play within the play and for the two men in the present. One of those two is an eggheaddoctor (Marc Bovino) that we can see is suffering from radiation sickness. The other is the radio show'shost played by Joe Curnutte. All are strong though Curnutte has the most substantial part and the mostfun (he was also in the successful drama Unnatural Acts  at Classic Stage Company).
Director Lila Neugebauer (who also helped conceive the show) creates some very effective moments, suchas a scene where the woman Anastasia is singing and her voice becomes a dim echo while other scenesare enacted or the striking use of total darkness before an extended monologue. It's a fine showcase forsome talented performers.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>DEDALUS LOUNGE  * 1/2
INTERART THEATRE
The best actors in the world can't bring a weak play to life. That's the unfortunate case with this new
drama by Gary Duggan. It offers the familiar tale of three friends who apparently stayed in touch afterdrama class. Anthony Rapp is a sad-sack fellow whose wife is always cheating on him and who half-heartedly dreams of starting a Queen cover band. Dee Roscioli is unlucky in love and has an ailingGrandmother she's responsible for. James Kautz is the live wire, the loser who likes to muck things up for
others to distract from the miserable mess of his own life. Sexual tension abounds.
You can take it from there, including an unexpected kiss between two friends, frustrated romance with
unseen others, painful revelations and a knock-down drag out New Year's Eve. Not a moment of it is
surprising or fresh. Director Chris Henry tries to liven things up thanks to the musical numbers that take
place mostly (if not all) in the mind of Rapp's character. The music and odes to Queen are also an excuse
for the two bartenders in the lounge where our characters meet to dance together and with the cast. The
choreography by JoAnn M. Hunter under less than ideal conditions is fine while Heather Phillips and
especially the appealing Curtis Howard create some emotional moments in their time at center stage.
With a lot more dialogue, our three main actors do a lot less, despite their talents. Rapp is of course a
marvelous actor but his character's very tepid idea of performing Queen songs never really connects onany level so it doesn't work as an explosive way of hearing about the inner turmoil the characters are
facing (Rapp and Daniel A. Weiss wrote the original songs). Roscioli does the best, perhaps because her
character makes the most sense.
Unfortunately, Kautz has the central role of a man meant to be magnetic and dangerous and sexy and
scary and as written he is none of the above. Near the end, the character talks to the audience and says
they probably either want to have sex with him or beat the crap out of him. Actually, no. He just seems
like a sad, uninteresting person and the sexual confusion tossed in later along with childhood revelations
of abuse and other dramatics feel tossed in and quite perfunctory. The allusion to Joyce? Just asperfunctory as the rest of it.
HOW THE WORLD BEGAN  * 1/2
PETER JAY SHARP THEATREThis is an "issue" play in search of an issue. In Catherine Trieschmann's drama, the liberal New York
science teacher Susan (Heidi Schreck) has come to Plainview Kansas in the wake of a disaster to offer her
help and pitch in at the local high school. Micah (Justin Kruger) is the awkward student who comes to
her with a concern about a comment she made in class on evolution. Gene (the always solid AdamLeFevre) is the adult caring for Micah now that the boy is an orphan (that disaster again).
It's apparent very quickly that Susan made a gratuitous and unnecessary comment mocking the religious
beliefs of anyone who thinks that life on earth was created by God. She calls any other theorygobbledygook. No one asked her to teach religious beliefs in her science class (such as Creationismdisguised as Intelligent Design). No student asked her about the Bible. She just casually and wronglytossed out the barb. Micah calls her on it and thinks she should apologize. Susan denies it, the problemescalates, she soon admits having made the statement and concedes it might have been not the best thingto do and in the ensuing discussion finds it difficult to go five minutes without cursing or taking theLord's name in vain. (Oh, those liberal New Yorkers!)
The problem with this problem play is that there is no problem. Micah is a sad kid but he's quite
reasonable. His unofficial guardian Gene is even more straightforward and friendly and accommodating.
Now a bad teacher or a person incapable of not ruffling feathers or a woman determined to raise a little
hell or too clueless to realize she's in the wrong -- I suppose any of this could create a decent drama. But
the play doesn't really acknowledge how essentially wrong Susan is in her actions.
Instead, in a desperate attempt to pump up the tension, we're tossed all sorts of red meat like the fact
that this single woman is also visibly pregnant. Then there's the unnamed disaster which goesunexplained for too long. After far too much murky reference (was it a terrorist attack?), it turns out tobe just a tornado that killed a number of people. So why the mystery?Toss in Micah's burning guilt overthe death of his hated step-dad (a particularly lame twist) and the burning of a scarecrow on the teacher'slawn and you've got a whole lot of nothing that can't disguise the fact that if the central character in thisdrama wasn't a bad teacher who refuses to apologize for a rude and unnecessary comment that there'd beno story.
LeFevre is most effective at making the decent, friendly Gene into a convincing person. Kruger has to
carry some heavy personal loads and almost keeps Micah genuine up to the absurd late twists. Schreck
has such a poorly written and unlikeable character she can do little with it. The set and costumes by Clint
Ramos are simple and effective though by and large the efforts of director Daniella Topol and her teamare wasted on a dull work. If this weren't a drama written by a woman, directed by a woman andpresented by Women's Project Theater along with South Coast Repertory, the suggestion that at leastsome of the teacher's foolish actions can be explained by her pregnancy would be risible.

<p>Teaching evolution in high school is a delicate subject fraught with danger for teachers (who often and
unfortunately avoid the topic as much as possible for that very reason). No natural disasters, hot-buttonissues like single motherhood or deep dark secrets are needed to turn it into compelling drama. Andwhen those things are present, they can't disguise the lack of drama either.
