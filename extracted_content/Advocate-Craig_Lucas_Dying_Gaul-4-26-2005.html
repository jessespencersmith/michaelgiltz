Th rime of
Penning plays, directing movies-now he's
writing the book for a major musical,ls there
anything Craig Lucas can't do? By ilichael Giltz
$hate breaking the law," moans New
York-based writer Craig Lucas
about talking to The Aduocate on
his cellphone whlle driving to afllm
premiere. Nobody catches him in
the act, though. Lately his life is too
charmed for that sort of thing.
Lucas, who tums 54 on April 30, has
e4loyed wide success with plays
like the recently revived
Reckless and screenplays
like the Oscar-nominated
Longti,me Companion.
His personal life is in fine
shape too, thanks to a
happy six-year relatiorship.
But with all that life be-
hind him, Lucas is peaking
only now. He made his fllm di-
rectorial debut at Sundance
wlth TLte Dyi,ng GauI, wtich
he adapted from his own play.
His hugely ambitious drama
Si,n ging Forest-a 2 l0-minute
opLs involving Fleud, Nazis, gay
love, and redemption-was a hit

Sisterc ts premiering this zummer at Seat-
tle's Intiman Theatoe.
At the moment, all eyes arc on T'lw
Light in the Piazza, Lucas's first original
musical, opening April 18 at Lincoln
Center. A collaboration with lyricist-
composer Adam Guettel-a New Yorkcritical favorite who
also happens to be
the grandson of
Richard Rodgers-
Piazza stands in
stark contrast to this season's broad
musical comedies like Spamalot and
Di,rty Rotten Scoundrels.
Based on a novella by Eliza-
beth Spencer, Piazza tells the
delicate story of a mother and
daughter vacationing in Flo-
rence. The daughter falls for
a well-born local Italian boy;
the mother wavers between
support and resistance; afeel I've found an ideal collaborator in
Adam. He's an absolutely meticulous,
almost maniacally concentrated, fo-
cused, brilliant, adaptable colleague."
What happens after Pi,azza opens?
More theater projects, of course. And
Lucas also plans to direct another film.
Soon.
"I loved it, I loved it, I loved it," says
Lucas about directing. "I would do it
again in a second. I have not always
taken the best care of myseH or others.
I think I've had a reckless life in a way.
But since I started directing movies, I
have to take better care of myself be-
cause you can't help support other peo-
ple who are having crises if you're not
healthy and centered. It's like I found a
whole different part of myself, and
thank God-I'm 53, almost 54. It's
abouttime." I

the story.
Says Lucas: "It seems
the perfect paradigm for
what all parents and
children go through.
Letting go, accepting
the otherness of who
your parents are and
who your children are,
recognizing that you can't keep them
safe and cannot live through their lives.
[The story] spoke to me. I felt like I fell
into a pot ofjam."
Lucas is just as enthusiastic about
Guettel. "I've always wanted to write
something with Stephen Sondheim;
we've bounced a few ideas around but
never found anything," he says. "But IRead an interview with Peter Sarg
