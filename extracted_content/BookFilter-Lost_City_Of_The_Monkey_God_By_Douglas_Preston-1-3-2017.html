From the Publisher: A five-hundred-year-old legend. An ancient curse. A
stunning medical mystery. And a pioneering journey into the unknownheart of the world's densest jungle. Since the days of conquistadorHernando Cortes, rumors have circulated about a lost city of immense
wealth hidden somewhere in the Honduran interior, called the White City
or the Lost City of the Monkey God. Indigenous tribes speak of ancestorswho fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyonewho enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling
journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of
artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of theMonkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joineda team of scientists…

What We Say
Great fun for armchair travelers, would-be adventurers who wrongly believe there's nothing left to explore and students of
history and archeology. "The Lost City Of The Monkey God" sounds exactly like the latest episode of Indiana Jones. Butauthor Douglas Preston -- co-writer of a string of thrillers along with solo articles and books for New Yorker, National
Geographic and many others -- proves that's not so far-fetched. In Honduras, legends have persisted of a legendary White
City -- as well as a culture to rival the Mayan -- which disappeared some 500 years ago. Combining serious reporting andjust plain fun, Preston shows how "lidar" -- a hugely sophisticated form of radar previously used to map the moon's surface -Share This Book

<p>- is put into play to "explore" inhospitable areas of the Honduras apparently untouched by humans for centuries. It reveals
three promising sites which might indeed be worthy of scholarly excavation, but first the potential must be demonstrated
with actual on-the-ground confirmation. Thus does Preston find himself joining a team of scholars and explorers venturing
into a gorgeous but highly dangerous Eden. The story combines political coups, scholarly backbiting, genuine sites worthy ofpreservation that might rewrite the history of the Americas, giant snakes of frightening intensity and the modest littlesandfly that proves their deadliest foe of all. Preston gives fair ground to some scholars who criticized the expedition hetook part in, though his sympathies (and the general facts) are on the expedition's side. It's an absorbing, fun read until the
final section where a deadly illness that strikes much of the team after returning home proves frightening and a potential
clue to what wiped this culture so abruptly off the face of the earth. Remember this disease which is already a majorthreat for the two billion people on the planet who don't have access to safe drinking water and sanitation: leishmaniasis.Thanks to global warming and the ever-increasing intimacy of the world's population, leishmaniasis is coming to aneighborhood near you sooner than you'd think possible. The "curse" of "The City of the Jaguar" (it's newly dubbed name
circa the Honduran government) isn't through with us yet. -- Michael Giltz
