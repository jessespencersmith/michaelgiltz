 American Idol  -- Top 9 Results:
Bye Megan Joy

Seacrest , Entertainment News
Here's the link to my original coverage of
Tuesday's performance show.
Now the results are in: the bottom three were
Allison Iraheta and Anoop Desai and Megan Joy.The bottom two were Megan and Anoop (as Ipredicted) and Megan is going home. For the firsttime, the judges' Save ability was treatedappropriately. Simon made clear before she sangthat they wouldn't save her and that Megan's
performance was her swan song. It made that last moment actually nice rather than a farce. I'dpredicted Anoop would go first but it was only a matter of time before they both left.
The night began with Paula seemingly in a nightgown and Adam back to his normal spikey hair.
(Good call.) Ryan asked Simon to pick the bottom three and he echoed my choices: Megan, Anoopand Matt. Then they did a group "performance" of the Journey classic "Don't Stop Believin," agreat tune given new life when it was featured in the finale of The Sopranos. For some godawfulreason, the group has been forced to lip sync these group performances. The lowlight was surelyseeing Scott MacIntyre belt out his line nowhere near the microphone. The Up With Peopleperformances were always ungainly, awful things but they did serve one purpose: givingcontestants a chance to cut one another and shine if only for a few bars. Either stop the lip syncingor stop the group performance. It's a truly dreadful farce. Yes, I suppose learning to lip sync is askill every pop artist must master, but not this early in the game. Please.
Hearing the contestants imitate each other was excruciating on many levels. Then the contestants
were put into three groups: Megan and Matt and Kris were in one group. Adam and Lil Rounds andAllison Iraheta were in another group. Scott and Danny and Anoop were in the third group. If oneof the groups was the bottom three, I was going with the first one (though the third was enticingtoo). If it was one person from each group, I picked Megan and Anoop again with Lil as the thirdchoice. Wrong again, of course.

SPOILER:
'American Idol'
Boots AnotherThen David Cook performed nicely and was given a platinum award for his debut album. Since last
year not even 20 albums went platinum, this is definitely an accomplishment. Platinum is the new
triple platinum.
Then they announced the bottom three. Matt was convinced it was he, but Megan got the nod and
literally flapped her arms and cawed as she walked over to the loser's circle. Hilarious. I like her
more and more as a personality each week. My friend Aaron was right in pegging her as a goofball
from the get-go. Then Allison got the tap and she too flapped her arms and cawed as she went over
to join Megan, saying, "Hey familiar chair!" . Obviously, Megan is infectious. Anoop joined them
and when they sat Allison back down Megan said, "Don't forget to caw."
Lady GaGa performed next and talk about showmanship: a see-through piano and she sang lines I
never expected to hear on Idol : "When it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun!" Dang!
Ryan made clear that Megan and Anoop were the two lowest vote-getters (out of 36 million votes),
something that isn't always clarified every week. Anoop looked very defensive and unhappy butMegan was the odd one out, immediately saying she didn't care, meaning probably that it's ok andshe had a great journey. Simon jumped on that to say that if she didn't care, they didn't either andthey wouldn't be using their Save and this would be her swan song.
In fact, that was a blessing since we knew the judges wouldn't save her or Anoop from elimination.
That let her sing a goodbye rather than be humiliated while the judges half listened and half talked.Either have both in the bottom two sing before announcing the one facing elimination or have thejudges make their determination beforehand like they did tonight. Pretending that oneperformance (of a song or arrangement the judges usually dissed the night before) really matters isa farce. They really need to fix the Save and Simon showed them how.
Watching Megan Joy cry and look at peace was rather sweet. I'll miss her goofiness a lot more than
I'll miss Anoop or Scott or Matt. And yes, those guys are all on notice, along with Lil. I expect the
final four to be Danny and Adam and Kris and Allison at the moment. What do you think? Who
are your picks for the final four?

Allison's amazing--I'm shocked she's been in the bottom three twice now. Even though she hasn't
picked very appealing songs (Papa Was a Rolling Stone? Yuck), she's performed everything well andmoreover, she knows her style, stays in it, and her style is relevant. As compared to Scott, who knowshis style, stays in it, and isn't relevant, no matter how obviously sweet and well-meaning the man.Ability is one thing, and good taste is another. Scott does not demonstrate good taste in music andbelonged in the bottom three with Anoop and Megan, who rightly deserved to go. 
Neither does Lil Rounds show good taste in music, or good enough anyways, I sadly add. As someone
else noted a terrific talent with an effortless voice, but she's failed to define herself as an artist. 
I love what Kris has been doing, he's a joy to watch and so unpretentious (has a boyish sexy appeal
like a young Paul McCartney) you could almost underestimate him, especially with a showboat like
Adam Lambert around. I thought at the first that this whole thing would come down to Adam, Danny
and Lil with my jury out on which of the latter two would be in the final, but I'm beginning to believe the
final two will and should be Adam and Kris.

Scott should have gone before her, but her song choices are uniformly awful; it's her own fault, really.
Next to go SHOULD be Scott, then Anoop, then Lil.The Top 5 really are terrific in their own right. Matt should go, then Allison; the Top 3, in a perfect world,
would be Danny, Chris and Adam -- in that order. I know Danny has that sentimental, X-tian fan base
(not to mention a bizarre resemblance to Robert Downey, Jr -- though no personality resemblance
whatsofrigginever) and is banking on it to the hilt, but he doesn't deserve to be Top 2; Chris does. Andeveryone knows Adam Lambert is a born star, ringer or no.

I liked Megan - but she did choose some bad songs.
PLEASE let Alison stay in the competition! She's just a confused young 'un with a HUGE amount of
talent and a lot of spunk! Every teen is going to have identity issues, if they dont want anyone with suchissues, why do they allow such young people into the comp? 
I dont understand why Simon is so down on her every week - he never has anything nice to say to her
- how can he not be impressed by her?! Having said that, her outfit was a bit crazy...but then again,there's nothing wrong with eccentricity!

See, I actually liked Megan. I thought she was extremely marketable, funny, witty, a very nice voice.
What people see in the Danny guy is beyond. I just don't believe he's very good. My picks are Lil, who
definitely has to start stepping up her game here. I mean, I agree with what the judges said a while
back. She, technically speaking, should be dominating this years competition. She has an absolutely
amazing voice. Effortless.
The only others I like are Allison, Adam, and Chris.
