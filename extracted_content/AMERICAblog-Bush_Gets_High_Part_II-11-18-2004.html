11/18/2004 08:01:00 PMAfghanistan is going great, folks...if you're a heroin addict."Heroin production is booming in Afghanistan, underminingdemocracy and putting money in the coffers of terrorists,according to a U.N. report Thursday that called on U.S. andNATO-led forces to get more involved in fighting drugtraffickers," reports the New York Times.One out of ten Afghans benefits from the opium trade. Afterputting US soldiers at risk and invading the country, opiumproduction is up to 87 percent of the world's supply -- only badweather and disease kept it from going higher. Opium is 60%of the entire country's GDP. How can we possibly call that asuccess?``The fear that Afghanistan might degenerate into anarco-state is slowly becoming a reality,'' said one person inthe report. ``Opium cultivation, which has spread like wildfirethroughout the country, could ultimately incinerate everything:democracy, reconstruction and stability.''
