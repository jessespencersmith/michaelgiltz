DIRECTOR Doug Liman has 
quietly become one of Hol­
lywood's most successful 
directors, but not because 
he keeps his mouth shut. The 40-
year-old New Yorker has been an 
outspoken observer of Hollywood 
ever since he broke througb with 
1996's "Swingers. " 
He followed that up with 1999's 
"Go," and then came 2002's block­
buster "The Bourne Identity," 
starring Matt Damon. His streak 
might have ended among the 
whirlwind of distracting pUblicity 
surrounding the stars of his latest 
film, the action-comedy "Mr. &. 
Mrs. Smith," out on DVD TueSday, 
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's 
romance got more attention than 
the movie. but it turned into a 
massive hit. And in the middle of 
all that, Liman ·· executive-pro­
duced and shot the pilot for a little 
TV show called "The OC." 
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith" is all about 
marital strife, and it never gets easy. 
There was encouragement from 
the studio to really resolve the 
film and have them live happily 
ever after. And I felt very strongly ships, there is no happily ever 
after. You live to fight another day. 
You're not manied. How do you 
know it's so tough? 
I've had some dooues of -
fights in my relationship life, 
and they're all-consuming . I have 
an outsider's perspective; which 
can be more honest than some­
body in the middle of it. 
One reviewer said Jofle's Mrs. 
Smith could wipe the ftoor with 
Pitt's Mr. Smith. Do you agree? 
1 do believe "helJ hath no 
wrath like a woman 
scorned." In the minivan 
when she's just finding 
out that he's been mar­
ried before. that's 
going to pump her 
up and give her the 
edge. Brad got 
upset at me, but I 
always thought she was a 
slightly better assassin. 
Did the gossip make doing the 
movie more difficult? 
. No. I like to flirt on the edge 
of danger. I ended up amusing 
myself a little bit with , Director Doug Liman 
. never pulls a punch 
how close to the edge of talking , 
about their relationship I could go. 
I do a lot of adventurous sports, 
and it kind of tapped into that 
part of me. For people 
like Brad, Angie. Jen­
nifer -I just can't 
anything 
Do you still over· 
see "The OC?" 
We're done. We 
were involved the 
first two years. Now I'm directing a pilot for NBC in a 
couple of weeks. 
Are you ·glad when people say 
"Boume"'sIiould inspire the Bond 
franchise to reinveat itself? 
First of all, you have to know I 
love James Bond. That's my fanta-
sy -to direct a James Bond 
movie. It's in my soul They 
would never even entertain 
talkingto me. It is a little urre-
al that this untouchable. gold­
en franchise might actually 
change as a result of "The 
Bourne Identity." 
Why didn't you direct "The 
Bourne Supremacy?" 
I personally hated 
the script. 
And the "Mr. & 
Mrs. Smith" sequel? 
Any other studio 
woUld immediately churn 
out a sequel. I've met with 
New Regency and we left 
without a great story. They 
said, "Let's reconvene in a 
month and see if we have a 
great story idea." This studio 
will not just churn out a 
sequel. It was refreshing.</p>
