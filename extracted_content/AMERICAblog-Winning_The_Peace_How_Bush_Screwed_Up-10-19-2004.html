10/19/2004 06:03:00 PMHey, the liberal media is finally waking up. Another lengthy, damning,fascinating article in the New York Times details the cocky, short-termthinking of the Bushies and how they failed to win the peace in Iraq.I love the description of Gen. Tommy Franks in Baghdad just after itfell. Sure, the Sunni Triangle -- the most obvious place for insurgentsfrom the Baathist regime to go -- was sparsely patrolled. And surethe capitol was still reeling from lawless rooting. But Franks held ameeting where they planned to start pulling out troops in 60 days. 90days after that, they'd be down to 30,000 troops. This was April of2003, more than a year and a half ago."As the Baghdad meeting drew to a close, the president in ateleconference congratulated the commanders on a job well done.Afterward, they posed for photos and puffed on victory cigars."Within a few months, though, the Bush administration's optimisticassumptions had been upended. Many of the foreign troops nevercame. The Iraqi institutions expected to help run the countrycollapsed. The adversary that was supposed to have been shockedand awed into submission was reorganizing beyond the reach ofoverstretched American troops."The rest of the article details repeated warnings that more troopswould be needed to win the peace and how Bush and Rummy ignoredit all.
