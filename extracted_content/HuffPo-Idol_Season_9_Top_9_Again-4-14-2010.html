 14Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyIdol  Season 9: Top 9...Again

Seacrest  , Simon Cowell  , Entertainment News
It's Elvis Week and Adam Lambert is the first
contestant to come back as a mentor -- and turns out
to be one of the best mentors ever. But what was up
with Ryan Seacrest's mocking reference to BrianDunkleman? That was cruel. In general, the typically
smooth Seacrest was goofy and distracting.
CRYSTAL BOWERSOX  --Sang "Saved" with
backup singers and a glittery electric guitar. Elvis did
some of the greatest southern gospel ever -- but this is
more of a fun roof-raiser. Kara called the lyricscontroversial for their time. I'm not quite sure why
they would be. Great and appropriate use of backup
singers (with an assist from the camerawork). Fine and strong.
ANDREW GARCIA  -- Sang "Hound Dog." Adam was straightforward about Andrew's rehearsal: "that
was boring." Yep, and so was his pre-song interview. Started strolling back to the stage before the music
was even over. Maybe better than the rehearsal but not that good.
TIM URBAN  -- Sang "Can't Help Falling In Love." More precise advice from Adam about singing in a
higher register at the finale, which he sort of used. Again, it was as good as Tim can do. Smart song
choice, smart arrangement, full Tiger Beat  mode. (With Ryan dancing in the background, I believe.)
Good God, could he make the Top 4?
LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang "A Little Less Conversation." Adam tried to break through Lee's poker face and
get him to show some expression while performing. You could almost see Lee thinking when he began to
sing, "Oh yeah, smile." He was so focused on the crowd, he even got away from the mike for amoment...and then climaxed with his back to the crowd. Weak ending but a lot of fun. And his best
moment was the jokey thumbs up and smile at the end.
AARON KELLY  -- Sang "Blue Suede Shoes." Aaron was right: the song was totally wrong for him, but
not because of the lyric about drinking. He's just not a swaggerer. And where were his blue suede shoes?

Karaoke.
SIOBHAN MAGNUS  -- Sang "Suspicious Minds," which I first heard via Fine Young Cannibals. Adam
got her to speed it up; another good call since she's pretty indistinct and unmemorable on ballads. Oddly,
she delivered the song in a sleepy, laidback manner when the tune is all about urgency, ignoring hisadvice. She only woke up when she got to wail. Even her look seemed tame, though a close-up showed
some crazy shoes and quirky detail. Polite comeback from Siobhan to Simon but the problem is not the
label; the problem is the performance. She can do anything she wants as long as it's good.
MICHAEL LYNCHE  -- Sang "In The Ghetto," which Siobhan suggested to him. Lynche finally
understands the difference between performing and being "theatrical," which is over-performing. Quite
good, especially since that song can encourage being overly dramatic.
KATIE STEVENS  -- Sang "Baby, What You Want Me To Do," an Elvis song I didn't even know. "You
just showed us, girl," said Kara. Not quite. Fine, but competent doesn't cut it at this stage.
CASEY JAMES  -- Sang "Lawdy Miss Clawdy." Yet more specific, good advice from Adam about the
arrangement and letting it build more. Casey seemed to take the advice but couldn't shake the song out of
just being a groove number. With the entire Elvis catalog to choose from, he couldn't choose a more
propulsive number? Bad bad song choice.
Only four good performances and none of them were great: Crystal, Tim, Lee and Michael. If there's a
bottom four, I'd say it should be Andrew Garcia, Aaron Kelly, Siobhan Magnus, and Katie Stevens. Thetwo going home? Andrew and Katie. What do you think?

I was glad to see Adam remind people why he was so appealing on AI - that amazing voice and
more ambiguous sexuality. If he'd done that performanc e of "what do you want from me?" on the
AMAs, he would have wowed people that were on the fence about him. Instead, he gave thatgarrish performanc e that was off-puttin g to women, homophobes , and most people outside his rabid
fan base. I want to see him do well; keep up the image you put forth on AI this week, Adam: lesslipstick, cool clothes, and those goose bump vocals.
Crystal is the only performer that I look forward to. Shioban has been turned into a stepford
contestant . She should have lost the up do hair style and picked up the energy and intensity of that
song. The first half was like she was in a beauty pageant or something.
Ryan does seem like he's in need of some lithium or something.
At +3000 Vegas odds, Katie is an intriguing darkhorse bet to win the whole thing. Tim is the longest
of longshots at +4000, in either case I could see teenage voters deciding it this year. Crystal is thebetting favorite at -150. Based on his performanc e last night, Casey is a mediocre singer at best,
and has zero charisma. Lee has a limited style, as in this year's Taylor Hicks, just can't seesomething like that happening again. Siobhan is talented, but just doesn't seem to wear well withinthe show's format.
Through my extensive internet research I've discovered the truth behind Ryan Seacrest's joke about
Brian Dunkleman. It turns out that Brian is starting a new show about his big mistake to leave Idol
and what it's like to be reminded every day about it. Brian needed a little publicity. Right at the righttime Ryan makes a big joke about Brian coming back to host the special NOT, right on Idol. Whathappens? Brian gets hordes of publicity, hordes of internet searches, and he gets to promote hisshow.
Hmmmm. Maybe Ryan isn't mean. Maybe he's looking out for his old co-host? Oh well.
Wasn't that a year ago for Dunkelman when he pitched that project? If Ryan was being
nice by throwing a little publicity his way, he should have made the comment in Jan of2009. Unless it's come to fruition? I'm just surprised to hear Dunkleman say he chose toleave the show. I'd always assumed they just let him go.

2 FansYes, it's coming to fruition soon and needs all the publicity it can get.
Tonight Andrew and Katey will leave the show. 
Also, we have found a replacemen t for Simon Cowell.... .. His name is Adam Lambert! 
By this time next year Adam will be he 4th judge on Idol. Did you know you can bet on-line as to who will win "American Idol?".... .. I got my money on
Casey..... . Not too sure now after last night. 
Judges said last night that Crystal reminded them of Bonnie Raitt..... EXACTLY!!! !...... And how
many million of albums has Bonnie sold?..... . How many stadiums has she sold out?...... . Crystal will
make the Top Three at best! THIS JUST IN....... Brian Dunkleman has found one more reason NOT to give up drinking!
I'm sure Adam Lambert wouldn't give up on his career yet by being an Idol judge (which is
how it would be seen). And being a good mentor isn't the same as being a good judge --but since he was great at one, he might well be good at the other. 
Uh, Bonnie Raitt isn't a big artist? She's won nine Grammys, sold at least 20 million albums
around the world (that's 17 million for certain in the US and Canada so probably a LOTmore than that) is in the rock and roll hall of fame and has guested on 100+ albums as well
as 30 hit singles in various formats. Comparing Crystal to her is both obvious and a huge
compliment . Raitt's three decades of success is a great accomplish ment.
Michael, 
You dare disagree with the man who predicted that Andrew and Katey would go
home last night? 
I think Lambert would take the gig as Judge if offered to him....... The exposure
alone would be hard to refuse. 
Yes, Bonnie Raitt is talented and has sold a lot of records to guys like you and me
who watch PBS and read Kerouac because we think that's what intelectua ls do. 
But do teenage girls have her poster on their walls? Has she sold 20 millionrecords on just one record alone? 
You have to distinguis h between being and "artist" and being a "performer ." 
For my money Harry Chapin is THE greatest recording artist of the last fifty
years..... . But is he a Sinatra? Is he a Michael Jackson? An Elvis? A Taylor Hicks?
Of course not. 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING A GREAT PERFORMER! 
In fact seeing a great performer is often more fun than seeing some sour looking
female guitarist with no makeup who sings about her uterus and eating danish withher friends.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

I'm ready to say adios to the two prettyboys , Aaron and Tim...Hast a!
Agree with Michael. None were great or memorable. I also did not like the street clothes look that
most of them wore. There was no pizazz or spark with any of them. Casey returned to his shallow
goofy grin smile performanc e. 
Lee looked like he was watching a tennis match with his head going from side to side. He doesn't
get it how to play to the audience.
Crystal looks terrible in those red lights.
But still these are my top three.
Siobhan sounded like she was singing two different songs. She is lost somewhere in the mix
unfortunat ely stung by the judges putting down her scream signature. Let the audience decide she
is screaming too much. After all Adam screamed a lot.
Yes, this night was forgettabl e. Ryan is getting too obnoxious. The performanc e were just lazy.
Well, tonight might make them to things a whole lot more seriously.
You're spot on regarding Seacrest's totally unnecessar y snark at Dunkleman. Anyone who watched
Season One of "Idol" probably figured Brian would be the breakout host, not Seacrest. So while
Brian in living in a studio apt in North Hollywood and Seacrest is counting his millions, why gothere? Just mean spirited for no particular reason. But, I'm like catcancook , Ryan has seemed off
his meds for weeks now.
I can't quite believe this season. Tim and Katie seemed also rans early on, but now they seem to
be getting better every week. They both shined, incredibly enough. Meanwhile, I thought Siobhanwould be a finalist but she has become so mannered along the way in her vocal style, it's as if sheis pod-Siobha n.
Big Mike sings "In The Ghetto'... Seriously? And does a rather maudlin job at that, while the judges
gush to rationaliz e their having saved him (after being pilloried online for it all week). All the great
Elvis R&B tunes and he has to sing about the ghetto?
And Casey, if ever there was a week he should've knocked it out of the park, he popped out behind
home plate. What a wasted opportunit y.
Crystal is still the best, but it's starting to look like she's gonna win by default, because Siobhan andCasey, who should have given her a run for the money, have run out of gas. Goodbye Michael andAndrew.
Ryan seemed drunk or stoned. No doubt about it, he was on something and acted bazaar and
disrespect ful more than on one occasion. 
Adam was fabulous as usual. He was really engaged and was bopping along to the contestant s as
they sand their chosen selection. His advice was dead on but too bad he wasn't there to help themchoose songs that fit them better. He apparently did that for the season 8 contestant s and was
responsibl e for a lot of creative suggestion s that worked. Permalink  | Share it

<p>59 FansI have only seen a couple of shows this season but I do like Siobhan's raw talent. She could use
some vocal coaching as well as polishing up on wardrobe,p resentatio n,etc. But the girl has a
powerful voice which is original-- yet very untrained and she doesn't seem to know how to use her
gift.
Thanks for commenting . I hadn't heard that about Adam Lambert last season. Interestin g --
and spotlights a generous, nice personalit y.
