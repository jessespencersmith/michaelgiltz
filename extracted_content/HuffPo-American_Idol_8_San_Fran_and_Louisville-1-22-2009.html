RATINGS UPDATE: American Idol  scored a
13.9 rating and was tops for the night with an
audience above 33 million, according toMediaweek's Marc Berman . That was a jump up
from the night before (which competed with theinaugural) but down from one year ago. Don't gettoo caught up in the night-to-night comparisons.Idol  is by far the biggest hit series on the air.
I was too caught up in the inauguration to watchIdol  on Tuesday. (Thank you, DVR!) So
Wednesday night was a double bill. And thank
goodness. So little happened that it took two hours of auditions to find two decent singers I couldroot for. I blame the producers: out of 31 golden tickets, we only saw nine full auditions of winners(and 18 total for a 50-50 split though none of the people rejected were close calls and a number ofthe winners were highly questionable at best). That's less than one-third of the golden ticket pool.Ugh. We did see sob stories and train wrecks and clueless folk but I don't care about these"heartwarming" stories. I just want to see some good talent. But I also blame San Francisco andLouisville. Obviously even the people who could carry a tune were pretty bland because thepickings for the show were awfully slim and if there were more jaw-dropping auditions, you can betthey would have made it on air.
SAN FRANCISCO  -- This won't take long. We only saw four people audition and get through and
only one of them deserved it. Tatiana Del Toro (whose friend is one of the world's most powerful
psychics and therefore probably knew I would write that) got through simply because she's a kook.
She's more a beauty pageant contestant than a singer though her voice was karaoke-quality fine.
Paula actually got her through by sideswiping Simon and bringing the others along with her. Too
bad it wasn't for someone good. Jesus Valenzula got through because he has two cute kids andushered them in to say hi. Kai Kalama is a nice guy who takes care of his ailing mom. I tend toresist/resent stories of heartbreak and nobility, especially when we watch a back story and then see

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol -- San Fran and Louisville
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----san_b_159906.html [4/5/2009 12:34:07 PM]the contestant work a reference into it in front of the judges. Kai sang "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"
in an ok voice and just as I wrote "dull," Simon said he had the personality of a cruise ship singer.
Like Jesus, Kai is good-looking in a straightforward way and certainly sweet. Maybe he'll come to
life in Hollywood. (And who's gonna take care of "momba" while he's away?) Finally, there was
Adam Lambert, a cute guy who's currently in the San Fran production of Wicked , has been doing
musical theater all his life and had a crush on Paula Abdul when he was a kid (she was his first
concert.) If he's not gay, he should be -- he must get awfully tired of turning down guys who ask
him out on dates. Adam sang Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody," which obviously plays to his
strengths as a musical theater guy since it's very over the top. I'm looking forward to hearing him
do something not in that vein. In a very weak crop, he looks like a winner.
LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKYAfter the dearth of exciting talent in San Francisco, I was hoping Idol  would come charging out of
the gate with some great singing. Instead, they started off with a train wreck.
TIFFANY SHEDD  (NO GOLDEN TICKET) -- It's always a danger sign when someone acts more
like Paris Hilton than an aspiring pop singer. Tiffany couldn't sing in the least and her indifference
to criticism made Simon's comment that she should picture 22 horses and a mule when wondering
how she did seem slightly less out of order. If you're wondering how someone who shouldn't singin the shower could imagine they belonged on Idol , just watch Tiffany's mom hold her hand and
jam out in rhapsody when Tiffany sings.
JOANNA PACITTI  (YES, A GOLDEN TICKET) -- A pretty girl with a good voice who belted out
Pat Benatar's "We Belong" (although she cheated on the high notes). So what's the problem?
Joanna raises the perennial question of whether undiscovered talent can include someone who hada record deal at A&M. This has been happening since Kelly Clarkson (who sang on demos and/orhad some minor deal that never went anywhere). As long as you don't have a current deal, you'reeligible. Me, I try to keep in mind how much pride someone must have to swallow to go fromhaving a deal at a major record label to standing in line with thousands of people to audition for aTV show. That's gotta suck when you already had your big break. But I definitely resist rooting forpeople who've been in the business so prominently. Joanna is gonna have to work extra hard towoo me.
MARK MUDD  (NO) - Country dude who butchered a George Jones song and then said, "Be
careful" when leaving, which the judges interpreted as a veiled threat. Surely that's one more
reason not to put him on the air. If he really was making a threat and resented them, why put himon TV and stoke that bitterness? (I understand their reaction but I think it was just an awkwardgoodbye. However, I'm a huge fan of Hill Street Blues  where the Sarge ended every meeting with
"Let's be careful out there," so I'm biased.)
BRENT KEITH SMITH  -- Good-looking married Christian (I noted the prominent cross and his
wedding ring) who did a fine, if bar band-ish take on Bad Company's "Can't Get Enough."
Definitely the whole package if his singing proves to be more than one note. Could be a sleeper. 
MATT GIRAUD  (YES) -- A 23 year old dueling piano player who looks like Michael Buble's
cousin, Matt had a disarming buildup that made me expect a train wreck. But he had a very
interesting performance and distinctive voice, something every judge commented on. Not sure if
he's versatile, but he is definitely one to remember. Besides, it'd be fun to have an Idol  winner
from Kalamazoo.
ALEXIS GARCIA  (YES) -- a sweet, cute, stay at home mom who got pregnant at 19 and is
engaged to the baby's dad, a guy currently in military school. She sang Aretha's "Dr. Feelgood" and
knocked it out. Another one to watch; she could surprise or fade away of course, but I liked herand Paula wooped while she sang (and then later gave some critiques as if Alexis didn't rock herworld.)
AARON WILLIAMSON  (NO) -- Enthusiastic guy who "wooed!!" a lot and could have played
Cuba Gooding Jr.'s buddy in Jerry Maguire.  Why would Paula say, "You don't have it ready yet"
when clearly he is never going to make it as a singer -- not even in a bar band? I hate it when being
polite means leading people on. "Singing's not for you." Is that so hard to say? On the positive side,Paula's outfit showed off her cleavage spectacularly well.

REBECCA GARCIA  (NO) -- Utterly without talent, which made Kara look at her profile, spot
that Rebecca was named "most humorous" in high school and then die with shame when she asked
the singer if this was a joke and then realized it wasn't. They all desperately tried to be nice to her.
LENESHE YOUNG  (YES) -- Her audition was preceded by the story of Leneshe's struggle with
poverty, the sort of heart-tugger that makes me resist mightily. I do NOT want to hear anything
about these travails when we get to Hollywood -- but the show has seemed more like Queen For ADay then ever before, so I doubt I'll get my wish. (That was an old game show where the person
with the saddest tale of woe won a fridge or whatever.) Then Leneshe announces she's gonna singan original song. That's about the biggest warning sign there is for me. Do people really think theirown tune is better than the zillion classics they could choose from? Imagine my shock whenLeneshe sang some tune she called "Natty" and it had a winning melody (for a while) and theamusing line "I like your thuggish ways" (which sounded cute when she sang it). AND she couldactually sing. The most promising audition from both nights, by far. To top it off, as the judges said"yes" and heaped praise on her, Leneshe broke down only to look up in shock when Paula gave hervote and said "no" just to tease the girl. Hilarious and wildly unexpected from Paula, of all people.
But out of 31 winning auditions we only saw 9 and out of those barely three were intriguing. Come
on, Idol , show us ALL the winning auditions  on your website.
So who did you like? P.S. I'll update with ratings once I see them.

Joanna Pacitti was Annie in the revival with Nell Carter. That was about 10-15 years ago. She will
definitely know how to handle that stage!

Thanks guys, I couldn't agree more. But Oreduck87, I think it's way too early to talk about the finals(unless maybe you meant the final 12 -- I thought you meant the finale.) We haven't seen the rest ofthe auditions and of course Hollywood always reveals more contenders. I do think the paucity of talentwas a factor in why the last two nights were so long on story and weak on performance. But there's noexcuse for not showing more winners.

Once again, a solid wrap-up of the show, and I liked Adam, cause as a community theatre actor Iappreciate his theatrics, and I really appreciate the cute factor. I also thought Matt was interesting aswell. BUT what about the guy who drank out of Paula's cup? Is he dead now? How strong could that
have been! Thanks Michael, looking forward to next week!
OreDuck87 See Profile  I'm a Fan of OreDuck87  permalink
I think Joanna Pacitti probably has the clearest road to the finals. I enjoyed Leneshe but did notice
some shortcomings (pitch problems and a noticeable break) about her voice that will become apparentas the weeks go by. Most of the others were blips on the screen. Alexis Garcia was probably myfavorite but I predict that she will go the way of other AI female vocalists whose voices have a little bitof edge: early round exit.
I wish they would show all of the qualifiers as well. I am sick to death of the mean-spirited tone this
year. I think, contrary to what was promised, that it is worse than ever.

I so wish they would dump all of the back-story, autobiographical garbage and SHOW US
EVERYBODY WHO MADE IT TO HOLLYWOOD. Thanks.
