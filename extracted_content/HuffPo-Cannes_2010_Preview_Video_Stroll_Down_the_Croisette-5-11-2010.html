Bonjour, cinephiles. I'll be covering the Cannes Film
Festival for Huffington Post, the blog site
Queersighted  (I'll be covering the gay angle of Cannes
for them), my awesome entertainment podcast
Showbiz Sandbox  and anyone who wants to send me
money. (Yep, Cannes is expensive and freelance gigsare few and far between.) Robin Hood  debuts on
Wednesday, though in a rather deflating move, it'sbeen screened for critics everywhere and already
reviewed (poorly, for the most part) by the trades,
major papers like the New York Daily News andothers. You can't help feeling silly flying out to Cannes
and then having the movies shown to journalists back
home. But of course Cannes hates this and fights it whenever possible -- it's the constant tug between
exclusivity and wanting stars from big Hollywood movies to walk the red carpet.
But enough griping. The festival looks very promising, with new works from major directors like Ken
Loach (a late addition), Mike Leigh, Bertrand Tavernier, Doug Liman (the lone American inCompetition), Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, a strong Asian contingent, Stephen Frears, rising talent Xavier
Dolan (who hopes to capitalize on his major success last Cannes -- I Killed My Mother -- with his second
film, Heartbeats  aka Les Amours Imaginaires ), Jean-Luc Godard, Rumanian Cristi Puiu, and many
many others. The longest film at the fest is Carlos , a look at the assassin Carlos The Jackal directed by
Olivier Assayas. I always insist on watching whatever random film happens to be the longest filmscreening at Cannes and it quite often pays huge dividends.
The Iceland volcano is STILL mucking with airplane travel but for the most part people are delayed,
rather than frustrated entirely. So let me close with some video: this is a stroll along part of the maindrag at Cannes and a look at the movie posters for upcoming films that wrap around the major hotels.This year's crop is decidedly mundane compared to years past, which is another sign of the economy.

 FollowThank you Michael for your wonderful videos. I am looking forward to reading your upcoming blogs
about Cannes and your list of the best movies.
I am personally not looking forward to watching Robin Hood. When I heard about the movie last
year, my reaction was same as it had been about the remake of - 3:10 to Yuma ...Russel Crowcannot play these roles. He is too fat and too arrogant to be playing the characters that great GlenFord and Early Flynn played. 
Just my humble opinion. Keep up the good work !Thanks.
Sorry for the typo: Earl Flynn.
I have heard good things about Blue Valentine with Ryan Gosling& Michelle Williams, directed by
Derek Cianfrance .
It got great reviews at Sundance where it premiered. I'm sure at the very least it will begood and certainly worth seeing. I'm a big fan of Ryan Gosling.
I had a call back for a small role. Derek and company were the sweetest people Iever auditioned for.
What I remember from Cannes is :More glitz than film, most people go to parties and don't watch the films. They spend a lot of timechoosing their dress and not much discussing films.

59 FansThe selection is usually pretty awful (3 hour long films about a guy talking to a cleaning lady about
this and that) and I heard that some years profession als are turned down at the accreditat ion
bureau while starlets can hop on the red carpet.Film lovers go to Venice, Deauville, Sundance.. .
Hi Lamirabell e. There are a number of very good film festivals around the world, like
Venice. Any film lover who can go to any of them is lucky. As with any film festival, you cango and spend all your time attending parties, all your time cramming in tiresome andunrevealin g roundtable interviews with the stars, all your time following business deals OR
if you're like me you can spend all your time from 8:30 in the morning till 2 in the morninggoing to movies. It's up to you. Me, I usually see at least 30 films at Cannes. People alwaysbemoan the selections in advance but when all is said and done at least three films on my
best of the year list come from Cannes. If you can see three great movies in ten days,
that's time well spent in my book. Unquestion ably, some of the best movies of the decade
debuted here during the 11 years I've been coming: In The Mood For Love, The Best OfYouth, Crouching Tiger/Hidd en Dragon, The Piano Teacher, Politist Adjectiv, The Diving
Bell and the Butterfly, A Prophet, Up (the Pixar film), The Class, Il Divo, Hunger, The Hostand many many others.
Oh and starlets are always welcome on the red carpet of course, but if you don't have your
ticket you won't get in no matter how famous you are. And the screenings starlets go to arenot the same as the screenings the press goes to so there is never a choice between pressand starlets. (The accreditat ion office is very fair; I say that even though they have been
cruelly blunt with me -- if you are representi ng a serious outlet doing serious coverage, you
will always get accreditat ion when you apply in time.) I'm sorry but Cannes is the
Wimbledon of film festivals. If you're a film lover, how could you not want to be here andsee new films by Mike Leigh, ken Loach, Godard, Cristi Puiu, Oliver Stone, Gregg Araki, JiaZhangke, Stephen Frears and many more.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST
