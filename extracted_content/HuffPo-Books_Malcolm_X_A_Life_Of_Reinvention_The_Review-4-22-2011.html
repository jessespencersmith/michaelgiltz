<p>and justice around the world.
It's natural to focus on the juicy bits, the
revelations not heard before or finally confirmed: the convincing proof of infidelities on the part of both
Malcolm X and his wife Betty, the stripping away of myth surrounding his criminal past, the shocking
lack of desire on the part of the police to find and convict the real killers, the informers and undercover
police that infiltrated his movements and the "gay for pay" claim that X's description of a "friend's"
involvement with a rich gay white man was a front for his own first-hand knowledge. (Marable quotes
letters from Malcolm X in prison, after converting to the Nation Of Islam, in which he hopes thisbenefactor can help him get out on parole early and provide him a home and stability of some sort.)
Needless to say, the children of Malcolm X have decried the book. But they shouldn't. It pays their father
the high respect of treating him like the world figure he is and strives to separate fact from fiction withthe sober, balanced eye of a writer and scholar whose only desire is to present Malcolm X fully, with all
his contradictions and complexity. This isn't the final word: too many documents remain unreleased by
the FBI and numerous police departments even decades after his assassination. But one thing isabundantly clear: you can't simply watch Spike Lee's film Malcolm X  or read The Autobiography Of
Malcolm X as Told To Alex Haley.  To get the fullest, fairest treatment of his life, you must also read this
book.
It begins with the story of Malcolm Little's parents, ardent supporters of Marcus Garvey, the closest
precursor to the black nationalism that fired the imagination of Malcolm X. We see his father's brutaldeath -- almost certainly a hate crime -- and the young, wandering life of Malcolm and his siblings asthey were unmoored by a mother overwhelmed by the bitter hypocrisy and discrimination of the state.Always smart and wary of work, it's no surprise when Malcolm reinvents himself as "Detroit Red" andembarks on a life of crime and a white girlfriend, a life that Marable insists wasn't nearly as hardcore asMalcolm X said.
In a reasoned manner that sets the tone for the book, Marable sets the cultural and political scene of
Harlem when Malcolm X arrives in New York. Marable details what X described in his autobiography and

<p>then dissects what was most likely to have really happened based on records of the time. For example, for
political reasons (Marable says) Malcolm X describes working with prostitutes in Times Square andburglarizing homes in all-white suburbs. Marable says it's more likely that the prostitution he dealt withusually occurred on 125th St. and he probably robbed some Harlem nightspots.
His time in prison and conversion to the racist ideology of Elijah Muhammad and the Nation Of Islam is
captured precisely by never downplaying the cult-like behavior of that organization or the very real and
very positive effect it had on Malcolm X. His work in the group with whole-hearted devotion, his growth
as a public speaker and thinker, his growing politicalization (when a central demand of the Nation Of
Islam was to avoid politics and the outside world) and his ultimate championing of a pan-Africanism are
captured brilliantly and precisely. At every turn you sense the essential truth of Malcolm X: whateverstage of his philosophical and political growth, he always represented fierce, unapologetic pride in theheritage of blacks and the strength they can and should embody in the face of oppression. This is whatelectrified millions who couldn't and wouldn't embrace the demonizing of whites that Malcolm X himselfultimately came to reject as counter to the tenets of traditional Islam.
It's fascinating to see exactly how focused the FBI and police were on a man and organization that called
on black people to abhor drinking and doing drugs, work hard and not ask for handouts from anyone.The Nation Of Islam and Malcolm X's later groups were always under threat of informers and undercoverlaw enforcement who tried to sow divisions between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad. One policemanassigned for months at a time to listen secretly to phone conversations soon realized that not only wasMalcolm X not a threat in the sense of encouraging lawlessness but that everything he knew about theman was wrong. He encouraged his superiors to work with Malcolm X. Needless to say, he was ignored.
But Marable truly shines in the book's final chapters. The closer we get to Malcolm X's death, the deeper
Marable plunges into the day-to-day changes. Malcolm X was being slowly kicked out of the Nation, aprocess that wrenched him emotionally even though he was quickly outgrowing both the narrow tenets of
the cult and disillusioned with the hypocrisy of Elijah Muhammad, who lived lavishly and had sex with
numerous secretaries while demanding sacrifice from his followers. Marable convincingly asserts that it'stoo simplistic to see Malcolm X as moving more towards the mainstream while Dr. Martin Luther KingJr. was becoming more radical.
The moment to moment contradictions in Malcolm X's speeches in the last months of his life are not the
words of a man telling each audience what they want to hear (tossing in an old school reference to"devils" at one stop; denouncing violence at the next; embracing a color-blind vision of life where you
judge deeds not skin tone at a third and hinting at inevitable and righteous violence at a fourth). They
are the words of a man who was discovering for himself a new philosophy, a new way of thinking thatwas still radical and strong (and strands of which would influence everything from the Black Panthers torap music) but also more mature and nuanced and with an international perspective.
Marable led The Malcolm X Project  at Columbia University, an online site filled with a wealth of material
on X's life and work. Slowly, more and more speeches, more and more unsealed documents and more
facts about the truth surrounding his life and death will come out. Others will surely build upon the workthat Marable has done here. But this book will remain a cornerstone for any serious scholarly work about
