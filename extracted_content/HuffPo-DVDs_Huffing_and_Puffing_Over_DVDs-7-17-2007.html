Nick Drake once sang, "Time has told me, you're a rare rare
find." And time can have that effect on art: revealing over-looked masterpieces and consigning once popular works to theash heap. Just look at this week's releases on DVD.
BillyWilder'scorrosive1951 dramaAce in theHole(Criterion;
$39.95) was a huge commercial flop when it came out --especially since it was bracketed by his Oscar-winning triumphSunset Boulevard  and the hit comedy-drama Stalag 17 . Wilder and swaggering lead actor Kirk
Douglas couldn't get America to cotton to this acidic tale of a down and out reporter whomanipulates a tragic accident to kick-start his career. But nothing ages better than cynicism.Today, its clear-eyed dissection of a media frenzy is hilarious and not even remotely exaggerated.
And time has given some much-needed perspective to 1984's Red Dawn  (MGM; $19.98). It was
morning in Ronald Reagan's America when this escapist tale about high school kids defeating the
invading Russians was a modest hit. But critics frantically feared writer-director John Milius'sfantasy starring C. Thomas Howell and Patrick Swayze might actually inspire World War III byinflaming jingoism. In fact, the Russians -- seen parachuting onto a small town school's footballfield in the iconic opening scene -- could just as easily have been aliens or Vikings. The importantfact for our heroes was not the nature of the enemy but their own bravery. They wanted to playwith guns and die bravely, not debate SALT II.
The passage of time also lets us look anew at World War II. We can find nuances and ugly truths
that had to be avoided when the fighting was fierce. Foyle's War  -- perhaps the best British
mystery series since Prime Suspect  -- has spent four seasons tackling the UK home front. In Foyle's
War IV  (Acorn; $59.99) you'll find marvelous explorations of resentment against the Yanks, secret

Accused Of...testing of chemical weapons, black market alcohol and other details overlooked in cheerier
remembrances. It's all wrapped up in fine mysteries pierced by the cool intellect of Foyle,
embodied by the brilliantly low key Michael Kitchens.
And time was when people considered Esther Williams a classy, upscale bit of entertainment,
thanks to her water ballets and absurd storylines. Now instead of just ignoring the silly films found
in Esther Williams Vol 1  (Warner Bros.; $49.98), enough time has passed so that flicks like
Neptune's Daughter  (1949) and Dangerous When Wet  (1953) have traveled from middlebrow to
forgettable to delightfully kitschy.
Time has also been kind, in a way, to Space Ghost and Dino-Boy: The Complete Series  (Turner Home Entertainment;
$26.98). A series that once languished in obscurity has been re-contextualized by the larky animated talk show that Space Ghost"hosted" for years on Cartoon Network (beginning in 1994),making this notably stiff original series from 1966 seemretroactively hip.
And if Sandra Bullock isn't careful, a few more movies like the
confused time-loop thriller Premonition  (Sony; $28.95) and
people will be wondering how she could have once been peggedas the next Julia Roberts.
