From the Publisher: On March 21, 2013, the European Space Agency
released a map of the afterglow of the Big Bang. Taking in 440 sextillionkilometres of space and 13.8 billion years of time, it is physically
impossible to make a better map: we will never see the early universe in
more detail. On the one hand, such a view is the apotheosis of moderncosmology, on the other, it threatens to undermine almost everything wehold cosmologically sacrosanct. The map contains anomalies that challengeour understanding of the universe. It will force us to revisit what is known
and what is unknown, to construct a new model of our universe. This is
the first book to address what will be an epoch-defining scientificparadigm shift. Stuart Clark will ask if Newton's famous laws of gravityneed to be rewritten; if dark matter and dark energy are just celestial
phantoms? Can we ever know what happened…

What We Say
Stuart Clark is both an accomplished astronomer and an acclaimed science writer (especially for The Guardian). With "The
Unknown Universe" he accomplishes a lot. Like Carl Sagan, he's an excellent popularizer; unlike Stephen Hawking, he won'tleave the layperson bedazzled but confused. Clark takes us to the very edge of our knowledge about the universe, or rather
our growing lack of knowledge, since the more you know about most complex subjects, the more you realize there is yet to
learn. In clear but never simplistic language, he spells out new ideas like gravitational waves and how the pictures we haverecently "snapped" of the universe -- the ultimate selfies -- are the closest glimpse we'll ever get to the split-second afterShare This Book

<p>the Big Bang. But this isn't front-line reporting about breaking news in cosmology. The real and enduring accomplishment of
"The Unknown Universe" is to give vivid portraits of great scientists from the past and show how the baton is passed from
generation to generation, from century to century: ideas raised in one era become outmoded or justified in the next. Clark
makes a mockery of those who wrongly believe science jealously guards its turf and has sacred tenets that cannot bequestioned. Time and again he demonstrates how everything from the most bedrock principles (Newton's laws of gravity?) tothe latest fad (dark matter?) can and will be upended. If new facts emerge, scientists immediately jettison whateverdoesn't fit. It's exciting, inspiring and frankly reassuring. The unknown universe is a testament to our unquenchable desire
to understand and explain and prove to each other what we think we understand about the way the world works. Clark
makes that endless journey a vivid one. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
The author brings the subject up to 2015 with the obligatory new discovery combined with a fine history of
cosmology, and he makes it clear that our knowledge and ignorance seem to be expanding in parallel. Sincesatisfying results have yet to turn up, Clark's book ends on a cliffhanger, but readers will be entirely pleased
with the experience. - Kirkus Reviews
Herein lies the tale of intrepid astronomers, across time and cultures, who were the first to observe, identify,
and document our misbehaving Sun. A delightful, informative read. - Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist,
author of 'Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries  ' 
The balance of brief biographies, technical exposition, intriguing trivia, and big-picture thinking is just right forthe context. There’s plenty of fresh and fascinating information to learn. The exciting recent discovery of
gravitational waves will make this title all the more relevant for the cosmologically curious. - Library Journal
In this well-researched and very well-written book, Clark tells the embattled, little-known history of modern
astronomy, a spry tale full of intrigue, jealousy, spite, dedication…
