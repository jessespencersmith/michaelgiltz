10/08/2004 02:03:00 PMGeorge Bush will do MUCH better tonight. How could he do worse?But don't call it a comeback! Just because Bush isn't godawful is noreason to pretend he's got momentum on his side now. Bush neverlost a debate in his life (before last week), so there's no reason hewould be expected to lose two in a row.So just because Bush manages to sort of stand up straight and sort ofnot look petulant and annoyed and sort of answers the questions isnothing to crow about.Bush may win or tie in tonight's debate but he is LOSING in Iraq andhe is LOSING in Afghanistan and he is LOSING jobs here at home.What's more important?Re: Iraq. Bill Maher made a great point on his show last week (hey, Itape a lot of shows and just caught up with it). Thanks to no-flyzones and cooperation with our allies, we controlled more of Iraqback when Saddam was in power than we do now. Bring that upanytime someone tries to say things are going well.
