 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: Some of the Best (and Worst)
Movies of the Year
DVD releases keep coming fast and furious, with this week's batch including some of the best movies put
out in 2011... and some of the worst. Ain't that always the way?
Take Shelter  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics) -- One of the best movies of the year stars
Michael Shannon as a troubled dad who is either having apocalyptic visions or suffering a mentalbreakdown -- or both, since apocalyptic visions can be very stressful. It confirms writer and director JeffNichols as one of the brightest talents in cinema today (he worked with Shannon on the excellentShotgun Stories ) and co-stars Jessica Chastain in one of her 18 excellent performances in 2011. Not to be
missed, from the slow-build beginning to the remarkable finale.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1  ($33.99 BluRay; Summit) -- Honestly, you don't care that I think
this may be the dullest Twilight  film yet. However good or bad relatively speaking these movies may be,
they're all grossing essentially the same amount of money worldwide. So if you've seen the others, you'll
see this one and the finale whether or not you're told that it basically includes a lot of scenes of peoplestanding around and talking and sort of killing time until the real finale in Part Two. Director BillCondon will hopefully get to bring more personality to the more action-packed events of Part Two.Meanwhile, the pop music remains the best reason to still pay attention to the franchise.
Project Nim  ($19.98; Lionsgate) -- One of the best films of 2011, this utterly fascinating documentary
looks at the life of Nim, a chimpanzee who took part in one of the most famous linguistic experiments ofthe past 50 years. At birth, Nim was taken from his chimpanzee mother and raised with a human familyto see if a chimp could be taught sign language in a more effective and revealing way by immersing himamong humans. The result was intense media attention in the 1970s and a life story with so many twistsand turns your jaw will drop. Personalities clash, lovers break up, Nim gets bigger and more physical,(more chimp and less "human"), funding is lost and found -- the saga goes on and on and on, with Nimstarting in a human home, moving to a country estate and ultimately sold off for medical testing despitethe best efforts of some of the people who have worked with him over the years. Director James Marsh(Man On Wire ) has pulled archival footage, new interviews and select reenactments to tell this
remarkable tale with verve and compassion. I wouldn't be surprised if it became a fictional film down theroad -- is Andy Serkis available?

<p>J. Edgar  ($35.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- How did Leonardo DiCaprio get swamped into delivering so
many committed, potentially fascinating performances in so many turgid, stiff bio-pics? First Martin
Scorsese and now Clint Eastwood entice him with roles bursting with promise. J. Edgar Hoover is
certainly a public figure ripe for investigation. But Eastwood always seemed an odd choice to plumb the
tortured depths of this polarizing, probably closeted figure and nothing in the movie has changed
anyone's mind. Like Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady , it's another film that tackles an utterly riveting
historical figure but seems afraid to take any point of view on him whatsoever. Armie Hammer plays
Hoover's right hand man (in every sense of the word) but we'll have to wait to find out his talent via a
better project.
Underdog  Complete Collector's Edition  ($69.97; Shout) -- It's a little unnerving to realize how
fragile our TV and film history can be. Underdog  has been a valuable property since it launched in 1964
by Total TeleVision productions. Nonetheless, original masters were lost, the other segments that madeup an original episode (like "Commander McBragg" and "Go Go Gophers" disappeared or gotdisconnected from its original show and on and on. So Shout has stepped in and done its usual thoroughrestoration, including the best masters of as much of the material as could be found. Underdog and hisgirlfriend Polly Purebred are back, along with his "energy vitamin pills" that were cut decades later out offear that kids might use drugs. (Uh, isn't taking vitamins supposed to be good for you?) It's not a greatseries but it is distinctive and fans will be delighted that it has been preserved with care on this six DVDset.

<p>Tiny Furniture  ($29.95; Criterion) -- For me, about the highest honor a movie can get is to be included
in the Criterion library. When it happens for a young filmmaker, it's an even more exciting claim -- this
isn't just a new talent, they're saying, this is an artist we truly believe in long term. So it's fun to seewriter, director and star Lena Dunham get the Criterion treatment for her breakthrough film Tiny
Furniture , a drolly painful look at a college graduate moving back home with her mother and sister
(played by Dunham's real mother and sister) while trying to figure out what to do with her life. It's no
surprise to see Nora Ephron and Paul Schrader among the extras, talking with Dunham about her work.
Talent attracts talent. I've already seen her pilot for the new HBO comedy Girls  and think it's truly
offbeat and intriguing. You need to catch up with her now and this set -- which includes her debutCreative Nonfiction  and four shorts -- is the ideal place to start.
Doctor Who: The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe  ($14.98; BBC/2Entertain) -- it's an
annual tradition: another Christmas, another Doctor Who  special. In 2010, they did a brilliant spin on A
Christmas Carol.  This year they've spun off an idea from the Narnia books. If you're willing to wait, this
episode will be included on the next complete season boxed set. But if you can't wait, it's a bit of
Christmas in February and very welcome indeed. Two other Doctor Who  titles are out as well. The Caves
of Androzani  comes from the Peter Davison years. Having just watched the lovely series All Creatures
Great And Small,  it's especially fun to see Davison switch from the lazy, girl-crazy Tristan to the Doctor.
And The Sensorites  is an adventure from the 1960s and the William Hartnell years. Each is $24.98 and
include copious extras.
Tower Heist  ($34.98 BluRay; Universal) -- The history of Tower Heist is a damn sight more interesting
than the movie itself. First, it was touted to be the first big budget feature from a major studio to be madeavailable day and date on Video on Demand/Pay Per View when it was hitting theaters. (I believe the costwould have been $60, with the idea that parents or groups of people might be interested.) That fell apartwhen theater owners balked. Then director Brett Ratner and star Eddie Murphy were slated to head theOscars until Rattner made a string of offensive and impolitic remarks that forced him to step down asproducer, with Murphy loyally following suit. Where did these remarks occur? During Rattner's PR trekto promote Tower Heist.  it's a pity the film itself -- sort of a spin on Ocean's Eleven  -- wasn't so hapless
and unfunny.</p>
<p>All Quiet on the Western Front  ($39.98 BluRay combo; Universal) -- The classic anti-war film from
1930 is just one of a string of movies getting a lavish reissue to celebrate Universal's 100th anniversary.
This set includes a DVD and a BluRay, a lavish hardcover booklet case with production history and stills,
a "silent" version and intros by Leonard Maltin and Robert Osborne. The movie looks beautifully
restored. It may be churlish to complain about such a worthy project but $40 seems a bit pricey for a
catalog title, even one as significant as this. Plus, a few more extras like a thoughtful commentary trackby an expert would be welcome and inexpensive. Still, it's a classic film carefully preserved and fans willbe able to see a landmark film at home in better shape than ever before.

A string of documentaries, some of varying quality but all of them with some intrinsic value thanks totheir subject matter. Truly, pound for pound you'll find that documentary films are a better, safer better</p>
<p>for entertainment -- especially when you're intrigued by the topic but often even when you're not. Matt
Damon narrates American Teacher , a straightforward and absorbing look at the intense challenge of
teaching. It puts the lie to the absurd demonization of teachers that has become a political football in thepast few years. It demonstrates simply and clearly how more than 90 percent of teachers spend theirown money on essential supplies, how two-thirds of all teachers take a second job to make ends meetand how a typical workweek includes at least 60 hours when you include grading papers and othercommon tasks teachers do at home. When you look at countries all over the world that have passed theU.S. in student standards, several factors are present: teaching is a valued, highly regarded professionand they are paid accordingly. Want better students and better schools? Pay teachers -- all teachers -- a
lot more and then expect more from them. And raising the salary means all teachers, not the sliver of
new teachers who enter the profession. Half of all teachers will retire in the next decade so the demand
for teachers and the need for great ones has never been higher. American Teacher  is not particularly
accomplished or artful, but it is essential viewing for anyone who cares about our education system.
You'll watch it and want to call your favorite teacher from grade school and thank them all over again.
On The Bowery  is one of the most notable archival releases of the year. It collects two major films and
some supplementary shorts by director Lionel Rogosin. On the Bowery  used non-actors to tell the tale of
men on Skid Row. It looks fantastic in this restoration, though the story has all the creakiness that non-
actors and a roughly improvised script can bring. Great extras include other shorts about the same world,one from 1933 and one from the 1970s. His other major film is the rather juvenile anti-war film GoodTimes, Wonderful Times . It's entire reason for being is to show people at a cocktail party nattering on
about this and that and contrasting it with found footage of war crimes, suffers of Hiroshima and HitlerYouth rallies. You get the point in about five minutes and it goes on for more than an hour. But
apparently it was a notable spur to the anti-war movement around Vietnam.
Woody Allen  is the full documentary that aired on PBS about the director's career. It's good for fans but
he remains resolutely unhelpful at self-examination; maybe he's talked himself out through therapy over
the years.
Most Valuable Players  is a rough, unremarkable look at high school students in Pennsylvania who
compete to put on lavish musicals every year. It's rescued by some memorable kids and a generous spirit.Urbanized  is yet another offbeat film by Gary Hustwit, the director of Helvetica  and Objectified . This one
tackles urban planning.How To Die In Oregon  is a straightforward but almost inevitably wrenching look at people in Oregon
facing the question of assisted suicide when it comes to end-of-life planning.
Finally, Pianomania  is an acclaimed look at Stefan Knupfer, the Chief Technican and Master Tuner for
Steinway & Sons in Vienna who must constantly juggle the demands of high-strung musicians, varying
halls and the demands of a particular piece to find the right piano for the right concert and make certainit's tuned ideally. Like any specialized endeavor, you'll be surprised how absorbing it can be even if youdon't care about classical music.</p>

The Geisha Boy  ($24.95; Olive/Paramount)
Rock-a-Bye Baby  ($24.95; Olive/Paramount)
The Jazz Singer  ($14.95; Inception)
Jerry Lewis fans rejoice. You've got three of his films, including two with the underrated director Frank
Tashlin. The one that will probably get the most attention is the overdue reissue of Boeing Boeing,  which
was brilliantly revived on Broadway a few years ago. it co-stars Tony Curtis in the Dean Martin-like role
of a swinger who balances multiple relationships with airline stewardesses by making certain when he'sdating one that all the rest are out on assignment. Thelma Ritter is her usual dependable self as thehousekeeper who's seen it all, but it can't hold a candle to the Broadway version I just saw. Geisha  and
Rock-A-Bye Baby  benefit tremendously from the visual flair of Tashlin. And The Jazz Singer  is a TV
remake of the Al Jolson film that aired in 1959 and has barely been seen since. Though aired in 1959, it'sthe color version that was filmed at the same time that has been nicely restored. The story was creaky inJolson's time and that's only been affirmed by Lewis and Neil Diamond but it's a definite curio.

Looking for a great film and comedy to boot. Try âQueensâ (âReinasâ from Spain with subtitles).
From a review at Amazon. This oneâs a keeper and hilarious.
âAvoiding the usual pitfalls of gay stereotypes, making the focus of this film about Spain's approval
of gay marriages not on the men involved, but instead on their mothers - the real Queens.
The story is fairly straightforward (if you will): there is to be a group wedding of gay couples in which
three of the couples involved have frantic problems with their mothers' attending. Some of themothers approve, others despair, others take advantage of the situation to meet their own needs.The effect of these 'double mothers-in-law' on the six men involved is packed with surprises,secrets, bizarre behavior, confessions, manifestations of life patterns less than reputable, and
whirling dervish spins on acceptance.
The mothers are portrayed by some of the finest actresses in Spanish cinema: Marisa Paredes
portrays Reyes, a famous actress (hysterically identified as Carmen Maura) whose class refuses toaccept the cat that her son is marrying her gardener's son; Carmen Maura (yes) plays Magda, theowner of a new hotel chain catering to gays; VerÃ³nica ForquÃ© is Nuria, a sex addicted
nymphomaniac whose drives don't prevent her form bringing her lusts home to her family; Mercedes
Sampietro plays Judge Helena who barely tolerates the effect of a public wedding of her son on hercareer but ends up being forced to perform the ceremony; and Argentine actress Betiana Blum isOfelia, a restaurant owner/worker who arrives form Buenos Aires for the wedding with her runaboutdog causing antics that threaten her son's relationship. The sons are played to perfection andwithout the slightest bit of stereotypical behavior we usually encounter in these films by six excellent
actors: Gustavo SalmerÃ³n, Unax Ugalde, Hugo Silva, Daniel Hendler, Paco LeÃ³n, and RaÃºl
JimÃ©nez. â

Eastwood played it safe with J. Edgar. After all, Eastwoodâs a republican too and didnât want toupset anyone too much. Project Nim is not something I saw or will see, as good as itâs reported tobe. Having an animal used for medical experimentation, although often needed is not something
thatâs very pleasant and especially when the animal has so many human qualities.   Go ape instead
over, âRise of the Planet of the Apesâ.   It's probably the best film of the year and it was frankly quite
stupid and insulting for the Academy to overlook it. The performance by the actor as the ape was
absolutely brilliant too, with amazing nuances that came through at every turn.  Recency   | Popularity
