' .. ( ',":' get complaints from 
the NAACP and others that net­
work television is lily-white . 
Despite a few sidekicks of color 
tossed onto existing series. noth.' 
ing much has changed. 
And the calls for boycotts have 
grown more insistent. 
Flying to the rescue is "City of 
Angels." Steven Bochco's hour­
long hospital drama set in LA 
and peopled predominantly by 
African Americans. It arrives 
just as dramas are flourishing 
again in primetime. (The show 
premieres Sunday, Jan. 16. at 8 
p.m .. then moves to a permenent 
time slot. Wednesdays at 8.) 
But if the show's star, Vivica A. 
Fox. has her way, people will soon 
forget all about the politics sur­
rounding a series that was in the 
wurks long before the current 
controversy . 
''I'm trying to turn that whole 
minority issue into a positive 
thing instead of a negative," says 
the beautiful 35-year-old star. 
"A show's got to be good to last, 
whether it's black or white. I 
really don't want that to be the 
emphasi s. because I don't want 
to turn off any of the audience. 
"!t·s not just a black show -
we've got crossover appeal. Myself 
[and costars] Blair Underwo od 
and Michael Warren definitely 
have crossover appeal. And we 
have other nationalities . I'm real­
ly hoping the whole emphasis 
doesn't become 'It's the black 
show, the black thing. It's black!' " 
Fox plays Lillian Price, the 
medical director of Angels of 
Mercy. She's called in to turn the 
flagging hospital around and get 
it accredited. 
driven career woman -
"She has no romantic 
", life: says Fox -Price is 
: using Angels of Mercy as 
a stepping stone to the next 
stage of her career. She also 
reunites with an old flame. 
"Lillian used to be engaged to 
Ben Turner (Underwood ): 
explains Fox, "but he dumped her 
three days before the wedding. 
He left her at the altar. 
"Their lives have reconvened at 
this hospital, and now she's his 
boss -which makes for excellent 
storylines as far as I'm con­
cerned." 
Fox -who made her name 
with strong performances in 
films like "Soul Food," 
"Independence Day" and "Why 
Do Fools Fall in Love?" -talks 
with savvy about the importance 
of a good time slot. 
"I won't lie to you -at first it 
made me a little nervous to be on 
Wednesdays at 8 because most of 
the shows that come on at 8 arc 
silcoms. I thought it would be on 
at 9 or 10. 
"The one thing that's good is it 
premieres during the winter 
when most people are at home 
because of the weather," she 
says. 
However the early timeslot 
plays out, a Steven Bochco 
drama is about as sure a bet on 
TV as it gets. Or is it? 
"Steven Bocho is the creme de</p>

, Blair UnderWpod (with Fox, right),

as his bciss~~which makes for 
exceUenl storylines," says Fox. 
"I'm reilly hoping the whole

the black show; the black thing, 
. It's' blaCk"· < ,<,

la creme," insists Fox. 
But in fact Bochco hasn't had a 
strong hit since "NYPD Bluc" in 
1993. ("Murder One" was a critical 
success but lasted only two ycars. 
Other shows like "Public Morals' 
and "Brooklyn South" disappeared 
even faster.) 
Besides, Fox has been on sure 
things before -most notably thc 
sitcom "Arsenio," which wns picked 
as a winner before evcn one episodc 
had been taped. 
,"They were totally hypcd on the 
~how , but they gave it three wecks." 
says Fox. "I don't know what thcy 
were expecting in three weeks. 
"'Seinfeld' took four years beforc 
it hit its stride. 
Hopefully, they'll give 'City of 
Angels' time to build an audicnce, 
let them find out when it's on and 
make it part of their time." 
Then there was her best sitcom -

"They moved us to Friday night 
which is TGIF -everybody knows 
that. They said, 'All you guys havc 
to worry about is producing good 
shows. We know it's a tough time

been on great shows that have been 
cancellcd, I'vc been on funny shows 
that havc bcen cancclled. ['ve been 
on shows that -well, they deserved 
to be cancellcd" 
Fox can laugh about it now, but 
when "Arsenio" was dumped "it was 
a real big shocker; I was surprised 
and sad." Still, she was !;Iad to jump at 
"City of Angels' -cvcn if it 
meant auditioning, some­
thing shc'd left behind aftcr 
shooting to success playing Will 
Smith's girlfricnd in "Independcnce 
Day." . 
"I had to audition . Bummcr. And 
my pridc almost kept me from doing ......

says in mock dint anger, "It \\'[l!-, a 
humbling experience, which was a

decision. 
"Steven is not "fraid to m"kc 
women powcrful." she '''Y". "We h"ve 
women directors and women head 
writers. When I come on the sct, I scc 
peoplc of color all around me." 
And she's stretching her acting 
chops like never before. 
"Thcy don't sug-arcoat things," 
says Fox, "which I rcally love -
coming from sitcoms where you 
havc to delivcr almost every line 
with a smilc. J gct t.o sink my teeth 
into some deep stuff. 
"In fact:' she confesses, "[ was

Thcy said, 'Why are you trying to be 
so nice?' I said, 'Becausc I have to 
make my charactcr likable.' Thcy 
said, 'Screw likablc. Do it.' I said, 
'Okay!'· 
As far as she's concerned. if the 
show makes any headway in adding 
a littlc color to primetime, it will 
simply be hccausc it's good. 
"Thc show is so well·written, well­
dircctcd, and well-acted: says ~'ox, 
who like most actn'sses has played 
a hookcr (in "Born on the Fourth of 
,July") and e,'cn a "stripp,'r with a 
hcart of gold" in "Indepcndcnce 
Day."
