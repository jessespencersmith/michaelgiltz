<p>It's a big leap from the age of 19 to 21 and in the case of UK artist Adele,  it's a very satisfying leap from
her debut 19  to her second release 21 . Right now she has the #1 album  and the #1 single "Someone Like
You"  in the UK, a rare and well-earned feat. (As a chart geek, I'll also point out she's the first living act to
have two Top 5 singles and two Top 5 albums (with her debut back on the list) since the Beatles in 1964.)
It's a good rule of thumb that your strongest song should be the first cut on the album. Rather boldly,
"Someone Like You" is the fitting finale to an excellent soulful pop album that shows Adele growing by
leaps and bounds as a songwriter. Her first album edged onto my best of the year list, but it was as much
for that powerful voice and the promise of the future as the fine album itself. (Great songs ended with"Chasing Pavements" but her singing carried the rest.) Watch her poise on Letterman as she belts out"Rolling in the Deep." Even the background singers are digging it:
Adele's  like a sane Amy Winehouse, an Alison Moyet with better solo numbers. It's classic pop, including
surging choruses, clap-along melodies, and lyrics that are sharp but universal. And as strong as thealbum is, you just know watching that clip she's even better live. That's always been the acid test for mostartists -- being able to deliver live. When Adele comes to NYC on May 21, she'll prove it. (Cruelly, I'll be atthe Cannes Film Festival and will miss her. Again.)
You can stream the entire album on MySpace.  So no excuses for not checking out one of the pure pop
pleasures of the year. It's a good reminder that with the right voice and the right arrangement, lyrics that
seem rather basic on the page can come alive on record. This isn't poetry; it's pop. That's why you sing it.
THE LOW ANTHEM  -- SMART FLESH
The Low Anthem  have a rare quality for a rock band: patience. They take their time on this spectral,
haunted new album. I don't just call it haunted because the first track is "Ghost Woman Blues."

<p>The entire vibe is spooky, with the vocals rising up out of a mine shaft or echoing throughout an empty
house and shadowed by emotions to painful to express. So they're haunted and patient. They establishtheir authority early on by taking "Ghost Woman Blues" at a stately pace and featuring a clarinet solo (Ithink). Right in the middle of the album comes another bold move -- "Wire" is a lovely instrumental thatwouldn't sound out of place on a contemporary classical album.
Put a banjo on your CD and I'll toss out the term Americana, but it's as good a place as any to start when
describing The Low Anthem's  all-encompassing sound that ventures from Aaron Copland to Uncle
Tupelo to The Band on their quieter days.
Formed in Rhode Island, they have a love for country and folk, with "Apothecary Love" boasting a
couplet that any Nashville songwriter would be proud of: "First she shot me with whiskey/Then chasedme with gin." They can also raise a ruckus, as shown on "Boeing 737" and "Hey All You Hippies." Butthey finish with the longest and one of the quietest tracks, the title tune "Smart Flesh." It takes its owsweet time because they have the confidence to know you'll keep listening. A solid follow-up to the
acclaimed Oh My God, Charlie Darwin.
You can stream the entire album Smart Flesh  on The Low Anthem's MySpace page.

2 FansThank you for sharing these wonderful musicians with us.It is so nice to hear clear natural
voices,and not the usual screaming we have to call music.David Letterman needs a shout out for having such wonderful talent on his show.I first saw The Low
Anthem on his show and was hooked,Oh My God Charlie Darwin. sent Chills down my spine.That
doesn't happen very often to an older person.
Yes, whoever books the musical acts on Letterman is aces.
Adele is a goddess. 21 is a fantastic follow-up to 19. It's interestin g because my favorite song from
19 was the last song, "Hometown Glory". My favorite song from 21 is also the last, "Someone LikeYou". They're both brilliant.
