            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  J U LY  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6Classic Animation Makes Comeback At DisneyWhen Pixar's computer animated movies took over the world, Disneypanicked and shut down much of its storied hand-drawn animation. Noone wants to see 2-D anymore they insisted. Balderdash. Now thatPixar has taken over Disney (and don't believe anyone who tells you itwas the other way around), John Lasseter -- the guy behind "Toy Story"and who oversees all Pixar movies -- has wasted no time refocusingDisney on what it does best: telling great stories. He's getting the guysbehind "Aladdin" and "The Little Mermaid" to work on "Frog Princess"in 2-D. Why? Because the world is clamoring for hand-drawnanimation (not that there's technically any such thing anymore)? Nope.Because that's the style that suits this particular story best. If it werebest told via computer animation or stop-motion or paper cuts, THAT'Sthe way they'd do it. Disney is in good hands.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
