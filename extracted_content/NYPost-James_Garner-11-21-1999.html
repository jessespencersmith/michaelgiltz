James Garner has made 
two classic TV shows 
and some memorable 
movies. But what Hollywood 
will end up remembering him 
for was his lonely fight 
against the studios. 
Before Tim Allen and 
David Duchovny started 
suing for their fair share, 
the man who played 
Jim Rockford was ... 
By MICHAEL GllTZ 
Tell James Garner that 
Entertainment Weekly 
named him one of the 
century's Top 100 entertain­
ers, ,and he immediately 
reSponds, "Am I ra nked 99 
of roo?'" 
Actually, Garner was list­
ed at 97, just above Garth 
Brooks. But that Quick wit 
and low-key charm have 
helped keep him on top for 
40 years. 
His trademark charm is 
on display next Sunday, 
when 'CBS's movie "One 
Special Night" reunites 
Garner with Julie Andrews. to deal with his wife's 
painful, slow decline from 
Alzheimer's, when they're 
stranded for the night in a 
cabin. 
It's really just an excuse 
to let two old pros go at it 
again. Watchin g Garner 
casually breathe life into 
this familiar tale it's no sur­
prise that the 71-year-old 
remains one of the busiest 
actors around. 
And he's also one of the 
most influenti al. Jimmy 
Stewart pioneered the now­
common practice of stars 
taking a piece of a movie's 
profits rather than a big 
salary upfront. But J~mes every other area. 
When Bruce Willis walked 
away from 
"Moonlighting ," he could 
take solace in Garner's suc­
cess after leaving the clas­
sic TV show "Maverick." 
When David Duchovny 
and Tim Allen claim they've 
been bilked out of their fair 
share of a show's profits, 
they can conjure up the 
image of Garner successful­
ly (and repeatedly) suing 
Universal to get money 
owed to him for "The 
Rockford Files," 
Garner made doing com­
mercials classy with his ads 
for Polaroid, which teamed

they were married in real 
life. 
Heck, Garner's indepen­
dent ways even signaled the 
death knell of the movie 
studios' grip on stars. 
"A lot of actors in my day 
couldn't [defy the studios! 
because they were afraid 
they wouldn't work again: 
Garner says. ~When just a 
few moguls ran it, they 
could call each other and 
say, 'Don't hire that son-of­
a-bitch.' But that was end­
ing when I sued Warner 
Bros. over 'Maverick .'" 
Garner reasoned there 
were too many independent

first co-stars,

next Sunday's 
CBS movie "One 
Special Night." 
Jack Warner. "And once one 
person hired me, then every­
one else said, 'Well, hey, if 
he's gonna work, we're 
gonna hire him too ,~ 
Not that his victory came 
without a price: Gamer left 
"Maverick" long before that 
show ran its course. And 
while studio head Jack 
Warner '!Iasn't all-powerful 
anymore, he could still scut­
tle a film or two. 
"The day I got out of court, 
my agent had a script on his 
desk from 20th Century Fox 
called 'The -Comancheros.'· 
Gamer thought the role was 
too similar to Bret Maverick. 
But when Gary Cooper 
<;""0.1 nn fnr the lead .</p>
<p>The director wanted him; the 
studio wanted him. But they 
never called him back. 
"I know what happened." 
Garner says. "Jack Warner 
called the producer and said, 
'Don't you dare hire him.' If I 
Could have proved that. I'd 
bave owned both studios. But 
I couldn't, so I never did any­
thing about it.' 
He made other hit. •• how-. 
ever. including the box-office 
smash "The Great EsCape" 
(1963). In contrast.' to 
Garner's endle88.and expen­
sive legal scrapping over TV 
shows, he saw some of his 
movies turn a profit. 
One of his best films is the 
comedy "Support Your Local 
Sheriff" (1969). "I got a 
profit check from that in 
four months." Gamer says. 
"and I've been getting profit 
checks on it ever since." 
Things were looking up 
even more when he 
returned to television in 
"Nichols," an offbeat show 
set at the tum of the centu­
ry "when the West' was 
dead." Gamer says. 
It had the quirky charm of 
"Northern ExpoRure." with 
Garner playing a sheriff 
who never carried a ((Un. 
Though ratings were mid­
dling (it followed NBC's 
biggest hit. "The Flip 
Wilson Show"). the show 
won a second season. 
"But the sponsor Chevrolet 
didn't like it," Gamer says. 
"One of the wi ves of the 
bigwigs saw the show and 
said. '1710(, not Maverick: 
and they canceled it. It was 
pretty stupid." 
But he's used to stupidify. .... '. ~_-...... r.J .... 01_ •• _~ •• _ ~. _ :-•• " '.', ~_-_. _ • ,', .-.-, •• '_'" -..... .r " 
Up In arms ... Gamer 
and Andra Martin 
starred in the 1959 
Peart liarbot' movie 
"Up PeriSCO\lC ." Right 
"The Rockfocd Flies" 
TV series -with 
Noah Berry as his 
father -spawned a 
string 01 movie spe­
ctals 
whether from sponsors or 
networks . Universa l has l06t 
to Gamer on several occa­
sions. and he's in the inidst of 
. another suit that challenges 
the way they split up profits 
from overscas sales. 
(Typicall y. a studio pairs a 
desirable show like 
"Rockford" with several 
losers and forces foreign TV 
networks to buy them as a 
package. Profits are spread 
evenly among all the shows. 
keeping the big hits from 
making the money they 
deserve and easing the red 
ink on a loser.) 
"That's a very tougb law­
suit - I don't think I'll win 
that one." admits Garner, 
who knows more than he 
ever wanted to about resid­
ual payment s and contract 
law. 
"It·s embarrassing. the 
bookkeeping in our indus­
try. I said on '60 Minutes' in 
1980 or something like 
that. 'Onp of these days. 
some judge. some jury, isl 
gonna put the'e people in 
jail because they're literally 
stealing from the govern­
ment and everyone else.' 
How can you make 70 to 110 
ll·ll·\' i~ion episodes and not make a profit? You'd be out 
of busincs.! It doesn't make 
sense. 
He's certainly not sur­
prised to see Duchovny. 
Allen and others fighting 
the same batpe" he won so 
many years ago. 
Artistic victories ha\'e aloo 
come to Gnrner. He earned 
an Oscar nomination for 
"Murphy's Romance" (1985) 
and reams of reviewers' 
praise for his tum in the 
overlooked drama "Twilight" 
(1998) with Paul Newman 
and SUAAn Sarandon . 
TV's been even better. 
thanks to critically acclaimed 
hits like the movies "My 
Name is Bill W." "Breathing 
Lcs.o;ons" and "Barbarian s at 
the Gate" -not to mention 
those "Rockford" movies. 
In fact, he's almost never 
been busier. This year alone 
he's hosted a 13-part docu­
mentary on country music 
for The Nashville Network . 
starred in a "Rockford 
Files" TV movie. appeared 
in the miniseries "Shake, 
Rattle and Roll" nnd 
filmed a new Clint 
Eastwood movie called 
"Space Cowbo'y ~" ldue out 
ncxl YC<Jr). But some things don't 
change. His costar in "One 
Special Night" -Julie 
Andrews -voiced concern 
this week that people might 
not accept her as an actor. 
That's exactly the same 
concern she had when 
Garner stalTL'<i with her in 
"The Americanization of 
Emily" in' 1964. 
"She was concerned about 
it and everyone was," Garner 
says. "But once I started 
"working with her. I knew 
there wasn't going to be a 
problem. In fact. 
'Americanization' really 
helped her to win the Oscar. 
They gave it to her for ... for 
for playing the nanny. 
What was the picture? 'Mary 
Popping.' What happened 
was 'Americanization' was 
released. and they saw this 
lady can nct. too." 
It's also another movie 
where Garner went his 
own way despite the price. 
"Kennedy was'sfiot when 
we were on the set. and I 
went home ... · says Garner. 
despite the studio's 
express desire not to fall 
h"hind ""hedule. "I. went 
hon~e an~ got docked a 
d".v spay.</p>
