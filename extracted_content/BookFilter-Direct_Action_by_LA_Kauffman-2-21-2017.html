From the Publisher: A vibrant, groundbreaking history of American
radicalism since the Sixties What happened to the American left after the
Sixties? This engrossing account traces the evolution of disruptive protest
over the last 40 years to tell a larger story about the reshaping ofAmerican radicalism, showing how the direct-action blockades,occupations, and campaigns of recent activist movements have functioned
as laboratories for political experimentation and renewal. Propelled by
more than 100 candid interviews conducted over a span of decades, thiselegant and lively history showcases the voices of key players in an arrayof movements – environmentalist, anti-nuclear, anti-apartheid, feminist,LGBTQ, anti-globalization, racial-justice, anti-war, and more – across an
era when American politics shifted to the right, and issue- and identity-
based organizing eclipsed…

What We Say
"What happened to the American left after the Sixties?" That is the question that has bedeviled activist and journalist L.A.
Kaufmann, who has been on the ground at protest movements ranging from anti-apartheid to ACT UP/NY to Earth First! andbeyond. She's wrestled with that query for years and the result is this scholarly work. Most imagine a splintering of the left
from its anti-Vietnam focus to a hundred different issues. Instead, Kaufmann paints a history of direct action. She sees its
roots stretching far back, but marks the beginning of the modern era to the May Day protest in DC on May 3, 1971. Themotto of the action was "If the government won't stop the war/ We'll stop the government." Thanks to police action, it wasShare This Book

<p>mostly disrupted before it began and has been seen as a failure. In fact, it rattled the Nixon administration and inspired
many with its bold, media-friendly tactics. Kaufmann shows feminist/socialist techniques spreading to groups far and wide,
ideas and tools such as group consensus, affinity cells and orgs that can plan actions and remain both nimble and harder to
infiltrate by the police. ACT UP brought a real PR and media savviness to the table. Earth First! combined real worldobjectives with a larger statement. And again and again groups wrestled with not simply reaching out to other groups (suchas people of color) but to embody diversity. The Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization fired up actions on anational and global scale and finally began to connect the dots between police brutality and economic inequality and
globalization and the destruction of the environment. And thus the splintered issues began to merge again, so that
#BlackLivesMatter could be media savvy, take advantage of the organizing skills of other groups, maintain its own identityand broaden the discussion from police shootings of black people to state violence against queers, the trans community andon. Kaufmann juggles an endless array of groups, with one protest blending into another. Yet she deftly shows whereOccupy Wall Street came from and why they were having those seemingly endless discussions about trivial matters. More
importantly, she asserts that it may have been swept aside by the state but ultimately inspired many effective and focused
Direct Actions with clear objectives in its wake. Again, this is not a narrative history of Direct Action filled with stories andpersonalities, which could be thrilling and more engaging to a general readership. Nor is it the how-to manual I imagined atfirst glance. But it's thoughtful and interesting and ultimately hopeful for those who imagined the days of radical activism
were stuck in the distant past. And someone should do a documentary film version: most of these protests involved
photogenic moments and a film could viscerally and literally link these issues and actions in a way a wide audience willgrasp immediately. -- Michael Giltz
