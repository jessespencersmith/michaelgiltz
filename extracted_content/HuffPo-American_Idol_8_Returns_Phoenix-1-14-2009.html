UPDATE: American Idol  opened to huge
numbers that dropped a modest 10% from the
opening night of last season. It was seen by 30.1million viewers. This show is a massive hit. Thelast network programming of any kind to top thatnumber? You have to go back to the OLYMPICSin August. That's right. The once-every-four-years Summer Olympics was the last networkprogramming to score bigger numbers. And theseason premiere of American Idol  was bigger
than most nights of the Olympics anyway, withonly the Opening Ceremony and key nights
pegged to Michael Phelps actually doing bigger numbers. Other than the Olympics, what was thelast network program of any kind to do bigger numbers than the season premiere of American Idollast night? Yep, the season finale of American Idol back in May: the showdown between the twoDavids scored 31.7 million viewers. This show isn't going anywhere.
American Idol  kicks off Season Eight without missing a beat: new judge Kara DioGuardi  fits in
smoothly; the contestants (as usual) run the gamut of the good, the bad and the ugly; and the
editing keeps it all entertaining. Idol  is every show wrapped up into one: a comedy for those who
enjoy the bad auditions, a reality show for those who prefer the sob story personal profiles and the
backstage drama of the Hollywood section, and a variety show for those who love the judges'banter, the taped bits and of course the singing.
People who insist the show is the ruin of the music industry don't know their history: talent shows
have been around forever, from Arthur Godfrey on the radio to the Apollo to Star Search.  And
American Idol  is above all a talent show, with audiences looking for a contestant they love and
rooting for them. Finalists have won Oscars and Grammys, been on Broadway, received criticalacclaim and sold millions of records. Eight years isn't enough time to judge a career, but KellyClarkson -- to name the first and most obvious Idol  success story -- has just released her catchy
new single. ( Listen to it here.  It's catchy as hell.) They're not going anywhere and neither is the
show. With the easy introduction of a new judge (after an earlier failed attempt), they've set

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----phoe_b_157746.html[4/5/2009 12:39:22 PM]themselves up for the next eight years. Eventually one of the original judges will step down but
they'll be ready. (And I'll finally get my shot at an Idol  dream: being a judge myself.) Yep, I love it.
On with the show.
Phoenix AuditionsThe opening montage included Clay Aiken several times, giving him as much (if not more) screen
time than any other previous  Idol contestant -- a nice nod to the latest Idol  finalist to come out.
And the footage of some tweens anxiously watching the Season Seven finale and shrieking in painwhen David Archuleta lost was my favorite moment of the night. Naturally, sappiness followedcomedy: "The beauty of Idol  is the journey itself," intoned Ryan Seacrest.
Tuan Nguyan  (NO) -- Guy with huge fro and goofy marching band military dance moves. Sang
Michael Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel." Badly.
Emily Wynne-Hughes  (YES) -- Mom always yearned to be a singer and Emily is the rocker chick
who sang Heart's "Barracuda" pretty well. Even more interesting was the fact that she's in a band
and none of them know she's auditioning. Going to Hollywood means they'll lose out on a tour of
Europe, but she never hesitates. The judges have a lot  of fun with that and Emily never blinks. She
tells them hopefully she can pull a Daughtry and bring the band along...eventually. But that'sexactly the sort of selfish focus you need to become a pop star. Plus her singing was good and she
looked cool. Definitely one to watch.
Randy Madden  (NO) -- Would-be rocker who wears the leather pants and has a catch phrase
about being a rocker in a box, but is missing one ingredient: talent. Often the show is painted as
cruel, but many times the judges try to be nice, and this is one of them. Madden is seen lookingvery emotional both before and after his audition and it can be fascinating to see people who havenever had a singing lesson or formed a band or probably even sung karaoke somehow expect to be"discovered." If you think you have a great voice, why wouldn't you be singing -- somewhere,anywhere? "I just want someone to tell me I'm great," he says before getting turned down. "That'sall." Paula really isn't helping the guy by saying he should be in a band and get some experiencebecause he can't sing.
J.B. Afhua  (YES) -- Good-looking kid who gets through. Hard to get a read on him, but I was
most intrigued by his dad and siblings. When J.B. got emotional and teared up after getting a
golden ticket, they all turned away and avoided eye contact as if emotions were embarrassing.
Michael Gurr (NO) -- Nervous guy who growls/mumbles his way through a Carrie Underwood
song. Followed by a montage of three more contestants who were weak. Seeing the episode as awhole, I'd say they definitely tilted away from making fun of contestants and kept the focus ontelling stories, whether the people were good or bad. Like...
Aundre Caraway AKA X-Ray  (NO) -- The first of a wave of singers who had dubbed themselves
with goofy nicknames. He sang an original tune called "Cactus Baby" and danced around goofily.
Way too energetic.
Ariana Afsar  (YES) -- Finally a winner, a 16 year old girl who scores points by founding a group
to bring teenagers into retirement homes and entertain the elderly. Then she scores cool points by
singing "Put Your Records On" by one of my favorite current artists, Corinne Bailey Rae.  Then  she
scores the most important points of all by nailing the catchy but tricky song very nicely. Cute as abutton indeed. Another one to remember.
Elijah Scarlett  (NO) -- Guy with freakily low voice. Again, the judges try to be polite.
Lea Marie Golde  (NO) -- Claims she is Kara's biggest fan and since Lea's main focus is
songwriting, maybe she is. Dressed up memorably with red hair and a pink cowboy hat and sings
dance tune "Everything We Touch" in a very flat, nasaly voice. Sweet personality but Paula isn'tdoing her any favors by telling her to work on her voice. Maybe she's a good songwriter and youmight as well encourage the interest she might have a shot at.
Stevie Wright  (YES) -- Named after Stevie Nicks, she wears a black and white dress and does a
very nice version of the Etta James classic "At Last," notably not  oversinging a song that causes too
many contestants to emote like crazy. Got better as she went along but Simon saw something a
little passive about her personality. "I want you to grow teeth," he advises, worried she may not

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----phoe_b_157746.html[4/5/2009 12:39:22 PM]have the killer instinct.
Michael Sarver  (YES) -- works as a roughneck on an oil rig and to me that was more interesting
than his bland personality and OK singing. But the judges loved the odd mix of this big burly guy
singing the Boyz II Men song "Thank You." Me, I'm always wary of contestants who claim they're
doing it to help their family financially. That's so goofily unrealistic and rarely the driving force of a
pop star that I'd rather hear they yearn to be famous. He was followed by a montage of four more
bad singers, which makes it easier to understand why the judges voted him through.
Katrina Darrell  (YES) -- showed up in a bathing suit, which worked just fine for Simon and
Randy. When she walked in Simon, chirped up nicely and said, "Let me tell you; it's smart" about
Katrina's outfit selection. Sang her way through Mariah Carey's "Vision Of Love" and wasn't awful
for a Paris Hilton wannabe but hardly good. Simon and Randy immediately say yes. (In fact, Simon
jokingly said she was great before she'd barely finished two lines). Kara and Paula are annoyed that
a so-so singer was getting through but Kara's rather annoying when she insists on belting out the
song herself. What does Katrina care? She gets through and Kara rescues herself by delivering the
best line of the night: "Next time, come naked." Katrina then walks out and makes good on a
promise. "Where's Ryan so I can make out with him?" she says. Their poolside kiss is notably
tepid. (Does Ryan want to hear more gay jokes from Simon?) The ladies are right on this one:
Katrina belongs on a reality show, not a singing contest.
Eric Thomas AKA Sexual Chocolate  (NO) -- Someone who would ink their back with "Sexual
Chocolate" definitely has the ego to be a pop singer. Too bad he squinted his way through Stevie
Wonder's "Ribbon In The Sky." Oddly, his mom promised him a new car if he didn't  get through to
Hollywood.
Brianna Quijada  (NO) -- Best remembered for calling Simon "Simey," she was not great on
"Let's Hear It For The Boy" and much worse on "Killing Me Softly," which is a really really hard
song to sing and a terrible choice for an audition unless you're actually Roberta Flack.
By the way, this is the first and only time we see Simon breaking a 2 to 2 tie. It would be
interesting to find out if the judges ever tied and he actually voted against himself when breaking
it. This time, he's right.
Deanna Brown  (YES) -- She follows a montage of winners but happily Brown is one more who
does a pretty good job with Otis Redding's "(Sittin' On The) Dock Of The Bay." Personally, I
thought she had enough vibrato to power a city, but it was indeed a distinctive voice and the judgesreally liked it.
Cody Sheldon  (YES) -- 17-year-old kid from Detroit who loves horror movies. Thanks to the
jokey set up by the show and the emphasis on his love of making slasher pic home movies, we were
primed to hear a disastrous audition. Instead, he delivered a pretty good rendition of JamesMorrison's "Wonderful World." Cody had clearly practiced a lot in front of his bathroom mirrorbut it was a good voice. I fear his lack of experience in performing live will undo him. But he'sdefinitely the Idol  most likely to benefit from a dramatic makeover. (They'll lose the goth look in
about two seconds flat, I predict.)
We also get a glimpse of how Simon amused himself: apparently he asked a lot of the contestants
what three countries they would be most popular in, eliciting a lot of amusing answers. Geographyis apparently not a strong suit of kids these days.
Alex Wagner-Trugman  (YES) -- A nice kid who just ignores Simon's joke about him coming out
of the closet. (His backstory was that he used to sing in the closet so as not to annoy his family and
caught an illness from mold in there.) Then, bizarrely, he insists that Randy sing along on thechorus of the James Ingram/Patti Austin love song "Baby, Come To Me," even though Randy hadnothing to do with that tune. In other words, he duetted with a guy on a love song, making Simon'sjoke actually sort of funny again. It was an oddly high voice, but Randy compared him to JoeCocker of all people and he got through. Not to be rude, but Alex seemed a bit too introverted topop out as a personality. He was followed by another montage of bad auditions.
Scott Macintyre  (YES) -- the final audition we see is of the visually impaired Scott, who is led
into the audition by his darn good looking brother. Basically blind, Scott skies and ballroom dances
and graduated from college at 19. I would have bet good money he'd make it through. (If he

sucked, they never would have put him on the air.) And yep, he goes through. But he shouldn't
have. Scott sang the Billy Joel gem "And So It Goes" in a rather weak, undistinguished manner. I
think he also faded out on the last word, singing "know" rather than "knows." If he was really bad,
I'd be offended for him -- clearly he doesn't need anyone's pity. But he was OK. He was certainly
dubbed "courageous" and Simon said Scott was a cool guy. More power to Scott for learning
classical piano and doing his thing. Maybe it was just a nervous audition and he'll be better down
the road.
In all, 27 people got a golden ticket for Hollywood and we saw 11 winning auditions. Idol  would be
smart to post all  the winning auditions online and let us get to know the other 16 contestants from
Phoenix that are heading to Hollywood. Let us watch them and judge for ourselves. The show can
never give airtime to everyone and there's no reason not  to let us get a peek at the people going to
Hollywood. This would also balance out the problem of singers who are barely seen suddenlypopping into the Top 20. What do they have to lose? Nothing. What can they gain? More traffic fortheir website.
Go HERE to see Ryan Seacrest hi-five the blind contestant Scott.
Go HERE to see a story on the ratings, which dropped minimally.
Go HERE to read Ken Levine's diss of the new season.
So what did you think of the first show? Any auditions stand out? And what did you think of new
judge Kara?

I've never understood why "news" organizations constantly report on the progress of reality shows.Especially ones that are well past their prime like A-Idol
I always got why Fox did it, they own the show. So the news value is less important than making
money for them.
But the others don't make money off this reality show, I can't understand why they give free
advertisements. I suppose some actually consider this news

Well, it's the number one show in the country and my coverage was for the entertainmentsection -- the same section that reviews CDs and movies and plays and concerts and dancesand art exhibits and so on. It's not "news" in the important sense, just coverage of a hit show.In my view, ignoring Idol would look pretty bizarre down the road -- don't talk about thebiggest hit show of the past decade, a show that gets bigger numbers than anything else onTV for the past eight months but the Olympics? Only the Super Bowl and the Oscar can
challenge it and those are one time events. The british press does this a lot more --
discussing what actually aired the night before on TV, the same way that people will stand
around a water cooler and discuss the latest twist on 24 or the new lead on CSI or whatever.
It's by no means important but what's wrong with talking about it?

Last night's two-hour premiere was well worth watching to the very end, when 23-year old ScottMcIntyre auditioned for the judges. McIntyre has been blind from birth. Sporting a 'Mind the Gap' t-shirt(a nod to London's famous 'tube' system) that he thought Simon Cowell would appreciate, McIntyrewon the judges over with his rendition of Billy Joel's And So It Goes. Because I have a profoundhearing loss, I rely on my boyfriend to tell me whether each contestant has a good voice. "Is he good?Can she sing?," I ask during each performance. I had my fingers crossed for McIntyre. "He's prettygood," my boyfriend replied, somewhat tentatively. When the song finished, I sat up straight in my seat.I had seen contestants with disabilities compete on Idol before, without success. But I knew the judges
saw talent in McIntyre, who is also a pianist and songwriter. The final outcome: Four 'Yes'-es from the
judges, and Paula Abdul told him she especially liked his "softer tones." I started to tear up. The judgessaw McIntyre's talent, his sheer determination, and the guts it took for him to audition without his'security blanket,' -- his piano. The media has called McIntyre's voice "like Coldplay." I personally can't
decipher musical style nor pitch, but I am delighted for him. I May others with disabilities (and talent)

The judges may see something we don't but in the end it's the public that buys the CDs.
McIntyre was not that great and I would not have given him that sympathy vote but since he'sthrough to the next round I wish him the best.

Thx for your perspective. The judges see a lot more of the contestants than we do sohopefully he'll grow in Hollywood and prove why they put him through. Your boyfriendcertainly isn't alone in thinking he was good.
