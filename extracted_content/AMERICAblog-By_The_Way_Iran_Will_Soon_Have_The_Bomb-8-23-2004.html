8/23/2004 10:29:00 AMIt didn't gain much notice, but a Bush official claims Iran has boastedto Western countries like Great Britain and Germany that it will beproducing nuclear material within one year and be able to have anatomic bomb of its very own in three.That makes two out of three members of the Axis of Evil gaining orthreatening action with their nuclear weapons on Bush's watch. Butdon't think Bush's foreign policy is a total failure. The totalitariantheocracy of Iran HAS embraced Bush's policy of attacking countriesyou think might someday be thinking of attacking you.More specifically, Iran has threatened the only democracy in theMiddle East -- Israel -- with a preemptive strike because it fearsIsrael might bomb those nuclear factories that it insists aren't nuclearfactories at all. So Bush's philosophy is resonating -- with the Axis ofEvil.
