• REAllY BIG SHOW 
r 
BY MICHAEL Gil TZ 
It began as a landmark 1989 British min­
iseries. Then director Steven Soder­
bergh turned it into an Oscar-winlling 
feature film in 2000. So the !lrst question 
that inevitably greers the new, USA net­
work miniseries "Traft1c" is: Why? 
Don't think screen\vriter Ron Hutchin­
son, who penned the gritty, six-hour 
drama, which airs three consecutive 
nights beginning Monday on the USA 
network, hadn't already asked himself 
that q uestioll. 
"How many times will they put that 
piece of pork in the grinder and make an­
other sausage om of h?" he Jokes. 
Given the worldv.,-ide success of the 
previous incarnations of "Traffic," Hut­
chinson, who also \vrote the BBO TV­
movie "The Josephine Baker Story," 
points out that another version was al­
most inevitable. 
"There was a period after Soderbergh's 
movie came out that every time you ,;,"ent 
to a meeting, people said, '\Ve \vant a:l­
orher 'Traffic.' v..r e want that la} ~red 
star\' with three different ideas.'" savs the 
screenwriter. . 
"You haven't seen too many of them be­
cause they're fiendishly hard· to write, es­
pecially for television where you've got 
all those act breaks. You're telling three 
or four stories; you've got 46 pages for a 
full hour to do it: in. So it's really hard to 
come up ;,."rith stories that \vill sustain that 
kind of comDlicated narrative ." 
His inspiration came \vhen he heard 
about :l real-life Italian case where bodies 
'l,i.'here \vashing up on shore \'{ith bullets 
in their heads. The answer to that mvs­
tery fuels the drama, \vhich expands the 
idea of trafticking beyond the drug trade 
to include iilegal aliens and [errOrisffi r 
Among the mOSI prominent storylines, 
Elias Koteas ("Crash") plays a rogue DEA 
agent rnissing in Afghanislan . His partner, 
played by Martin Donovan ("The Oppo­
site of Sex"), is back in the United States, 
doing his job and comfoning his partner's 
wife (Mary McCormack). Balthazar Getty 
("Natural Born Killers") shows IIp as a 
businessman who joins rhe traffickers be­
cause he's "tired of flying coach." 
These criss-crossing stories are all tied 
together by the tale of Adam Kadyrov 
(Cliff Cunis of "Whale Rider"), an iiiegal 
immigrant whose ,:vife and dal!ghter die 
in a mysterious accident while being 
sDluggled into the United States. Kadyrov 
pushes to !lnd out what happened and 
punish those responsible r 
Once the screenplay was set in motion, 
the cast was assembled . Actress :Niarv 
McCormack, best known for playing 
Howard Stern's wife in "Private Parts" 
and for her recent work in the experi­
mental REO series "K Street," signed on 
to play the wife of a DEA agent who may 
have gone AWOL before the !lnal scripr 
was ready. She trusted director Stephen 
Hopkins, acclaimed for his work on the 
F ox series "24." 
"He's really laid back, bur he also knows 
what he's doing," says McCormack. "You 
feel like he's -and he is - a thousand 
times smarter than you are~ If I mess up, 
he'll know and he'll !lx it." 
McCormack knew how high the bar was 
set going into the project. "I'd seen the 
British miniseries and the American 
movie and both are really good, so that's 
a little bit scary," says McCormack, 34. "I 5 r 
clways thought, 'Oh, they'll re-title it.' 
And thev didn't!" 
In her' conversarions with Hopkins, she 
became convinced that this "Traffic" 
could say something fresh. "Vv-hen I 
talked to Stephen, ! felt convinced that r the storvJ was new. It feels that Vlav to 
me. ThOl.igh of course you can see exa'ctly 
where it came from." 
\Vhat will fascinate viewers about this 
ne'iV miniseries is how the trafficking isn't 
just linked for plot purposes . 
"\lv' e started digging into the role that 
heroin plays in this underground \vorld," 
says Hutchinson . "If YOll want to pay 
somebody off, money is kind of inconven­
jent. Large sums of money are quite 
bulky. You've got to carry the cash 
around or turn it into the banking system 
and there are so rnany l)\"ays you can trace 
that these days. Far better to give the bad 
guys a bag of heroin. It's very portable.. 
You can dispose of it quickly if you get 41 
5 
into trouble. You c~n shoot it up yourself 
if you like it!" 
The currency in the underground may 
be heroin, but in Hollywood, it's relatio:rr­
ships. 
"I don't think I got the job just because 
Jeff Wachtel, one of the heads of USA, 
was my best man, but we did have a very 
intimate experience," says HutchinsOD _ "I 
broke both my wrists - I got attacked by 
German shepherds 10 days before my 
wedding and I literally couid not zip my 
own pants ,vhen I went to the bathroom . 
Maybe that forged a relationship that is 
deeper than most, even in Hollyv;;ood . I 
think it took him 20 years to get over it. 
Actually, he said there were 20 people 
they'd spoken to about 'Traffic' and I just 
happened to be the 21st."
