 DVDs -- Celebrate Moon Landing
With Little Known Classic For AllMankind

News
I saw  For All Mankind  in a nearly empty movie
theater back in 1989 and I've been continually
surprised ever since how few people know about
this engaging, gorgeous and thrillingdocumentary about the Apollo missions.
Criterion has just released a new edition of the
film on regular DVD ($29.95) and BluRay($39.98 -- but on sale at Amazon, the BluRay isonly $20 -- $5 less  than the regular DVD! I've
only seen the regular DVD). Do yourself and yourfamily a favor and rent or buy it immediately.There's no better way to celebrate the moon
landing.
Like a lot of great documentaries,  For All Mankind breaks a lot of rules. Filmmaker Al Reinert
(who went on to co-write Ron Howard's best film, Apollo 13 ) decided to treat all the Apollo
missions as essentially one event. His film depicts an idealized journey from the earth to the moon,
grabbing footage wherever he found it and even letting the voice of one astronaut describe hisemotions while we are watching somebody else. Why? As explained in a very good making-of
documentary, Reinert realized that the best launch footage might come from one mission, the best
space walk from another (not even an Apollo mission, actually), the best shots inside the capsulefrom another, the best view of a stage of the rocket breaking off from another and so on. So he just
mixed and matched and created the best story he could, without worrying that footage from Apollo
9 might jump to footage from Apollo 4 and be followed by Apollo 13 and so on.
None of this matters when you watch the movie. It's simply a gorgeous, nerve-wracking
experience. Your first response is awe; the second response is "Why haven't we ever seen thisfootage before?" The views of the rocket igniting and launching into space are overwhelming. The

<p>Michael Giltz: DVDs -- Celebrate Moon Landing With Little Known Classic For All Mankind
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds----celebrate-moon-la_b_241371.html [7/21/2009 5:16:25 PM]massive explosions, the roiling flames, and the noise  help you realize that they don't launch or glide
or soar into space -- they explode  into space and being the guys perched on top of that roman
candle has never seemed nuttier. When an astronaut goes for a space walk, it also seems
terrifyingly scary...until you're overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of what they're seeing. Then theastronauts are on the moon, rolling around in a car and hopping about while giggling like little
kids. Who can blame them? But the images are so sharp, so clear and striking it takes your breath
away and you feel jealous all over again for what they got to experience.
All these years, the supplemental footage tells us, we've been watching grainy copies of copies of
the same two or three moments. The footage on display in For All Mankind  was simply never seen
before, often even by NASA. Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey  came out a year before the
moon landing and that film is still revelatory. Sometimes you might have to remind yourself that
this footage is REAL and it's really happening. That's how inured to space missions we've become
by both the lack of anything beyond the space station (which dulls our realization of how
dangerous traveling beyond the Earth can be) and the constant images of it we see in movies. But
few movies real or fictional are as gorgeous to behold as this one.
I can't imagine any science teacher who wouldn't want to show this film to their class. I can't
imagine any kid who would watch this and not spend at least the next few days saying they want tobe an astronaut. I can't imagine any adult not seeing it and appreciating anew the beauty of Earth
and the foolhardy, wonderful recklessness of what was accomplished 40 years ago. For All
Mankind  is a classic.
Other Recent Criterion Releases
As I've said before, you can never go wrong purchasing any film released by Criterion. They're
always substantial films produced with loving care and extras that set the industry standard. Every
special edition DVD put out by any other studio is just imitating what Criterion pioneered. They'vealso been smarter than major studios by pricing BluRays the same as their regular DVDs. On saleat Amazon, they're increasingly priced even less since sometimes the extras that need to be on a
second regular DVD can fit comfortably onto the much roomier BluRay version. Here are some
recent titles of theirs now available. I always try to talk about DVDs within a week or two of theirrelease but Criterion titles are timeless so you can talk about them anytime.
Last Year at Marienbad  ($39.95 for regular or BluRay from Criterion but the regular on sale
at Amazon is $34.99 and the BluRay is only $19.99) -- OK, I'm not a fan of director Alain Resnais
but he's a director you simply have to deal with if you're any sort of film buff and the enigmatic
puzzle that is Last Year At Marienbad  is the principal reason why. This 1961 New Wave landmark
virtually defined one half of the twin poles of foreign films for American audiences. On the onehand you had the earthy humor of Fellini and the tantalizing promise of sensuality (foreign films
always promised more skin than they delivered but boy were they sophisticated about sex). On the
other hand, you had the high art pretensions of Godard and Resnais. Audiences delighted in tryingto "figure out" this movie in which guests at a famed exclusive resort may or may not have met
there the year before and may or may not have had an affair or be having an affair right now. It's a
lot more fun if you don't try to make sense of it. I've compared both the regular DVD and theBluRay and both look gorgeous. Both are loaded with extras, including a new audio interview withResnais himself, who is still producing inexplicable but playful films even today.
My Dinner with Andre  ($39.95; Criterion) -- It never seemed that audacious to me. A movie
about two guys having dinner -- literally a movie in which one guy gets in a cab, arrives and spends
almost two hours talking with his friend? Why not? When the two guys are Wallace Shawn andAndre Gregory, it makes even more sense. Gregory spins tale after tale during dinner, fantasticalevents from his life that quietly glide into fantasy (a faun? Did he say a faun?) and usually seem to
end with everyone in the story drinking and dancing until dawn. Director Louis Malle captures it
all effortlessly, though the effort in making two guys sitting at a table not become boring seemsdaunting. But actually, it's not and those filmmakers who edit with a frenzy even the action-packedmotion of a concert or car chase should take note. In fact, movies are FILLED with lengthy scenes
in which two people simply talk: the centerpiece of the IRA film Hunger  (which opened earlier this
year) involves a lengthy talk between a priest and a prisoner) or the opener of Quentin Tarantino's
upcoming Inglorious Basterds  in which a farmer talks with a Nazi in his farmhouse for about 20
minutes. Both are thoroughly gripping. And so is My Dinner With Andre which still seems toflummox people with its premise. I remember my brother's incredulity when I suggested we watchit years ago. "Two guys. Having dinner. That's it?" Half the fun of his watching it was knowing he
could go back to his friends the next day and tell them the nutty film I got him to watch. And then,
out of nowhere, he became caught up in what they were saying and forgot how ridiculous it was

interviews Malle.
The Seventh Seal  ($39.95 on regular or Blu -- I have the regular)/ Bergman Island  ($19.95;
Criterion) -- I have one problem with someone watching The Seventh Seal for the first time on
DVD: without an audience surrounding you, you probably won't realize how much humor is
embedded in this iconic film about a Knight returning from the Crusades and facing off against
Death. No, it isn't Woody Allen's Love & Death,  but there is quite a bit of humor in this allegory
(terrible, unfriendly word, that). Bergman became awfully dour in the Seventies and made a stringof austere films, but his best works -- like this and the delightful Wild Strawberries  and Smiles On
A Summer Night  and his last masterpiece Fanny & Alexander - have a surprising amount of
warmth and humor and joy. Seal  has a string of extras, including a second disc that contains
Bergman Island,  an 83 minute distillation of a lengthy TV interview that Bergman gave a few years
before his death. That's also available on its own, but I'm sorry they're only putting out the
theatrical version, since the complete TV interviews run for hours in length and are absorbing. Still,
Bergman Island  does give you the greatest hits of this final look at the director and his life.

See TallulahNoble last week (there was a sale on Criterion DVDs, and I also bought the Criterion edition
of "The Third Man"). "For All Mankind" is the definitive documentary, in my opinion about the
space program!
BTW, last night Turner Classic Movies aired "The Right Stuff" in honor of the 40th anniversary of the
first moon landing. For a Hollywood depiction of the early days of the space race, nothing can top "The
Right Stuff"--great script and one of the best ensemble casts EVER!

I watched it a few weeks ago and had the same reaction -- why don't more people know about this
film?

One doesn't need to buy FOR ALL MANKIND. It's on TCM today. I had alreadyset my DVR to record it before reading this very interesting review.
I have attempted to watch MY DINNER WITH ANDRE on three different
occasions. On each of them, I have seen 10 to 20 minutes of it, and then
found myself waking up, with the film long over. I'm not making a joke here. It has literally put me tosleep, deep sleep, on three separate viewing attempts. I keep hearing from intelligent, discriminatingcritics like yourself that it is fascinating, and each time it has proved to be the most effective sleep-inducing drug I've ever encountered.
Alfred Hitchcock, in his book-length conversation with Truffaut, spoke of trying to make MOVIES, not
"pictures of people talking." MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is the ultimate "picture of people talking," andregardless of how riveting I am repeatedly told their conversation is, I have found it over and over to beas soporific as Hitchcock warned.

Well, at least you've found a great tranquilizer for the nights when youhave insomnia :) I've sometimes not "gotten" a movie or book thatothers love and have been willing to give it two or three shots (after adecent interval has passed to let my disinterest/hatred subside). Likeany discerning person, you gave an acclaimed film more than a fair
shake. (I, for example, dislike most of Godard despite several tries on numerous films.) Andnow you never have to watch My Dinner With Andre again. Unless, of course, you're havingtrouble falling asleep. Thanks for mentioning the TCM airing. I forgot to do so.

Understand, I'm not saying MY DINNER WITH ANDRE is abad or a boring movie. I can't, because I haven't seen mostof it. It has truely just rendered me unconscious everytimeI've attempted to watch it. I have heard many times that it'sgreat from people whose opinions I respect, but it drops me
in my tracks.

I should add that I've had the reverse experience withJacques Tati films. I love his four Hulot films, but on acouple occasions I have run one or another of them forfriends, only to have them left utterly cold and bored by him.
