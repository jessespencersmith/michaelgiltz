9/23/2004 01:06:00 AMThe United States has 150,000 troops in Iraq. (Not nearly enough toget the job done.) Great Britain has the next highest number oftroops. Their total? 7,000. And Maureen Dowd mentions in her latestcolumn that the London Observer reports the UK is going to cut thatnumber a third to under 5,000. That means soon 97% of the troopsin Iraq will be ours and ours alone. Some coalition.
