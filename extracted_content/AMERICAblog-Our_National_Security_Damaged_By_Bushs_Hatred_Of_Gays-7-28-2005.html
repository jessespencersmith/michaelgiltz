7/28/2005 11:27:00 AMI don't care how much you hate gays; our nation's security ismore important than pandering to the far right. Bush kickedout trained and patriotic Americans who have the valuable skillof speaking Middle Eastern dialects. Why? Because they're gay.And when those soldiers tried to get placed in other branchesof the government where their skills are desperately needed --such as the FBI -- Bush sent them packing.Bush doesn't care if this endangers national security. For all weknow, the Paris address of Osama Bin Laden or info on the next9-11 or the next 7-7 could be buried in our files untranslatedand we wouldn't know. Mind you, these translators go in towork, sit at a cubicle and go home at night, so we're not eventalking about combat troops sharing living quarters. Anyonewho cared about this country would order the military to letthese people serve their country and place our nation's defenseahead of blind hate. And now onto the absurd situation at theFBI that inpsired this rant.We've known for years that our intelligence units are piling upemails, transcripts from phone conversation taps, letters andliterally millions of pieces of info all in Middle Eastern languagesfew speak and even fewer are learning. And the backlog isgrowing. Bush's lackeys were grilled by a Senate committeetoday.The Federal Bureau of Investigation's backlog ofuntranslated terrorism intelligence doubled last year,and the time it takes the bureau to hire translators hasgrown longer, officials said Wednesday....The F.B.I. "has no assurance" that some 8,300 hours ofuntranslated material does not include information thatcould be critical to terrorism investigations.In addition, the bureau told the committee that itslong-delayed effort to overhaul its computer systemand allow agents to search terrorism files more easilywould not be completed until 2009 at the earliest.Two of the F.B.I.'s most pressing problems - itscomputer capabilities and its ability to translate terrorismmaterial - have continued to languish, and in somerespects have worsened....The F.B.I. was not the only counterterrorism agency thatcame under fire at Wednesday's Judiciary Committeehearing.At the office of John D. Negroponte, the director of nationalintelligence, a program manager who runs theinformation sharing environment office - responsiblefor linking federal, state and local offices to combatterrorism - told the committee that he had only onefull-time employee and two contractors, some sevenmonths after the directorate was created.2009. 2009!! Bush was President when this country suffered theworst attack on our soil from a foreign power in history. And he'sgoing to spend EIGHT YEARS in the White House without even beingable to update the computer system of the FBI. How incompetentdoes Bush have to be before people wake up?If Bush were President when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, he'd
