Tonight on PBS's American Masters, they take a close look at the life of Peanuts  creator Charles
Schulz. Linked to the new biography by David Michaelis,  it focuses on the parallels between
Schulz's real life and the strip, as well as the very real melancholy Schulz dealt with his whole life.
The book and this episode are both acclaimed, but personally, watching the story of an artist's life
always makes me antsy - if they're important enough to write a biography or make a documentaryabout, I'd rather focus on the work that made them famous in the first place.
With Peanuts,  the most successful - and most
successfully merchandised -- comic strip in history,that's always been easy. There's a Charles Schulzmuseum,  DVDs of animated specials and of course
countless reissues of the strips in book form over theyears. But the most exciting and satisfying Peanuts
project is the ambitious 25 volume masterpiece The Complete Peanuts being created by publisherFantagraphics.
They've recently put out volume eight, The Complete Peanuts: 1965-1966  ($28.95; Fantagraphics),
and like all the previous volumes, it's beautifully designed by graphic novelist Seth and a joy to
behold. The influence of Peanuts  is obvious, of course, and reflected by the range of people who've
written introductions to these volumes: director Hal Hartley, novelist Jonathan Franzen, jazz artistDiana Krall and newsman Walter Cronkite are just some of the names who've revealed theirpassion for Peanuts.
What's less obvious is the pleasure to be had in reading Peanuts  in big gulps. Comic strips are
really on the lowest rung of appreciation among hardcore comic book aficionados. At the heart of
their love is the comic book, followed closely by the graphic novel, mangas and the like. Frankly, goto most comic book stores and they care more about movie spin-offs of Spider-Man  than a
childish comic strip, collections of which are usually relegated to a dusty bottom shelf. And I can'ttell you how many artists and fans I've spoken to who foolishly dismiss the landmark Doonesburystrip  as poorly drawn and without interest.
So Fantagraphics took a major gamble in devoting so much time and effort to Peanuts  and it's paid

Lavish...off tremendously. While serial strips like Doonesbury  and Gasoline Alley  (aka Walt & Skeezix,  just
out with Volume Three of its complete strips ) are obvious beneficiaries of being reprinted in full,
the appeal of reading one or two years of Peanuts  in a row is less obvious.
Certainly a poorly done comic strip would be a bore. Heck, they're a bore even one day at a time.
Alternately, a brilliant one panel work like The Far Side  by Gary Larson  has been rightly collected
in two massive volumes, but devouring them one after another dulls the pleasure.
Not so with Peanuts. The first volume saw Schulz find his feet. Later editions saw characters
change and morph into the people we know so well. The most recent book -- covering 1963-1964 --
was Schulz's most wacky and satirical, a key moment when he was deciding whether to commitfully to the reality of these kids or use the strip as a launching pad for less durable but more easilyproduced social satire.
Schulz chose the kids and the results flower in the current volume. Snoopy battles the Red Baron
for the first time and becomes a writer, Linus grapples again with his belief in the Great Pumpkin,baseball games are lost and Lucy proves that if she were emailing people in the computer age youcan be certain most of her messages would be delivered IN ALL CAPS! Your favorite characterdepends on your mood - I love Lucy's crabbiness one minute and Linus's sweet nature the next.But the eternal loser Charlie Brown is the heart of the matter.
Read the strips one after another and you'll marvel how Schulz balanced so nimbly between the
genuine concerns of childhood (the kid you have a crush on, nervousness over meeting new people,
fighting with your siblings and friends) and droll comments on the wishy-washiness of life.
Linus is watching TV and gets furious when Lucy arbitrarily turns it off, righteous in his anger.
Then when he's exhausted his pique, Linus says to himself, "It was a lousy program anyway."
When Schroeder gets annoyed by Lucy draping herself over his piano and he walks away, she
barks, "THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE EMBARRASSED BY A PRETTY FACE! THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?"And in the next panel: "A PRETTY FACE MAKES YOU UNEASY, DOESN'T IT? HUH? DOESN'TIT?" And in the final panel she says reflectively, "He shouldn't feel that way.... Lots of people getembarrassed in the presence of a pretty face..."
It's that final panel that nudges the strip into greatness -- the way Schulz quietly shows us
comforting and deluding ourselves just to get through the day. The cultural impact of Peanuts  has
been ongoing for decades. (Would Christmas be the same without them?) But republishing theentire series in one gorgeous volume after another is really the first time we can truly take a stepback, appreciate his work as a whole and ultimately wrap our arms around the accomplishment ofCharles Schulz. Sometimes, happiness is a warm book.
