7/18/2005 04:25:00 PMThe LA Times offers a roundup of the latest on Rove, with thistidbit catching my eye:Prosecutors investigating whether administration officialsillegally leaked the identity of Wilson's wife, a CIA officerwho had worked undercover, have been told that Bush's toppolitical strategist, Karl Rove, and Cheney's chief of staff, I.Lewis "Scooter" Libby, were especially intent onundercutting Wilson's credibility, according to peoplefamiliar with the inquiry....A source directly familiar with information provided toprosecutors said Rove's interest was so strong that itprompted questions in the White House. When askedat one point why he was pursuing the diplomat soaggressively, Rove reportedly responded: "He's aDemocrat." Rove then cited Wilson's campaign donations,which leaned toward Democrats, the person familiar withthe case said.And they had no idea Rove was involved? Right.Oh, and the LA Times also caught how Bush has gone back on hisword and now refuses to fire someone who leaks classifiedinformation during a time of war.
