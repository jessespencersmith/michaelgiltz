THEATER: "Love's Labour's Lost"...But A Good
Meal Is Never Wasted
SHAKE  AND  BAKE:  LOVE'S  LABOUR'S  LOST  *** (but knock
off half a star if you skip the alcohol)
SHAKE  AND  BAKE  THEATER
What hath Tolstoy wrought? Ever since a musical version of War  and
Peace  tossed some so-so appetizers and a shot of vodka at theater-
goers and called it a meal, it seems like any offbeat show trying tostand out thinks, "What about food?" And while the food at the
immersive Natasha,  Pierre  and  the  Great  Comet  of  1812  was the least
of it, certainly the alcohol can't hear. Most any show is improved by a
drink during the interval. (Though who can afford the typical prices ofa Broadway bar?) Still, while the idea of dinner theater done with
panache isn't precisely a bad one, it's not terribly good either when the
food feels like subpar catering.
Happily, that is not the case with the meat-packing district
presentation of Shakespeare's Love's  Labour's  Lost.  The title Shake
and  Bake  is amusing, the food was more substantial than one usually
gets (akin to a full meal rather than the hyped-up canapé or twousually proferred) and the choice of play was wryly amusing.
Shakespeare's early comedy involves a king and his friends pledging to
AVOID good food and drink and merrymaking in general so they can
devote three years to sober study. Good for them! They will eat justone meal a day. They'll even fast one day a week. They'll sleep onlythree hours a night. And they won't even lay eyes on a woman, muchless woo them. Good luck with that. Their pledge lasts about as long as
it takes for the Princess of France and her attendants to come to court
So a play that abhors food is presented while the audience indulges in
nonstop food and drink. And a play that -- oddly for a ShakespeareMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>romance -- has a slot for music only at the very end, here features
music and dance from beginning to end. Shakespeare would approve,
or at least the Groundlings would.

If you're a wine snob, you might want to splurge on the top ticket sincethat gets you an upgrade on the wines served (a glass of white andred). However, I must say that even the standard wine was palatable,which is saying something since I have no nose for rosé and the like
but -- if this makes any sense -- it means I'm even less  accepting of a
so-so wine than someone who knows what they're tasing. The shot of
Jägermeister of course can hardly go wrong. The play began withpickled seasonal vegetables -- in our case, carrots and green beans. Iquite liked the tart flavor of the carrots, while the green beans were
snappy too. In every case, I'd suggest diving in and consuming away;
the sooner you're done, the sooner you can give your full attention tothe action. (Unless of course, an actor is right next to you. I held off onchomping away while the clown cavorted on my couch or an actor
soliloquied nearby. I mean, just because food is on tap is no reason to
be a barbarian.
One more reason to eat away? The food keeps coming. A modest taste
of salmon and cream cheese on a cracker, a fine side salad of mixed
greens (of course), a Cheeto-dusted mac n cheese that was the only
tricky item to consume (and really, being a mac n cheese fiend the onlyone I really felt was too small), a brisket taco served during theinterval, a pink lemonade soda palate cleanser, a roasted beetgazpacho that should also be just a smidge bigger in portion and a
dessert left for us to serve ourselves as the cast slipped away -- namely
a buttermilk panna cotta that was a highlight to this sweet toothedcritic.
I wouldn't want to oversell the food. But heck, I just saw Oklahoma at
St. Ann's Warehouse and the down-home vibe of a barn social was
sealed by the fact that they prepared chili and cornbread and thenserved it to the audience during the interval. Well, I love actress Mary►  November (4)

<p>Testa and she opened up a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix with zest and
dumped it in a bowl, but she did NOT make corn break muffins. And
the crock pots lining the set, sitting tantalizingly in front of theaudience? Just for show! The muffins and chili were actually preparedelsewhere and offered up in a teeny tiny styrofoam cup with a sliver
(yes, a sliver!) of cornbread laid on top that made the tasting menu of
Shake and Bake look like a banquet worthy of Henry VIII incomparison.
Yes, many many shows have tossed in food and/or drink but rarely
with skill. Executive chef David Goldman and the onstage chef JeffVentricelli delivered under the far from ideal surroundings of livetheater.

Hmm, now what am I forgetting? Ah yes, the play. The creative teamassuredly did not. They chose wisely and they trimmed off the fat(which includes the longest word in the English language and  the
longest speech in all of Shakespeare) to deliver the meat of the play in
under two hours, including a break. (I was, frankly, astonished when I
looked at my watch after it was over.) They also kept the sense of theplay, by and large, though the clownish subplot of the romantic feudbetween the Spanish lord (Charles Osbourne) and Costard (who surely
should be spelled Custard here and was played engagingly by Rami
Margron) was set up and then mostly dropped. That aside, the wooingand wordplay between the King's men and the Princess's women (noneof whom were interested in sticking to their various vows) came acrosseasily.
The adaptation by David Goldman, Victoria Rae Sook (who also gave
herself the plumb role of the Princess and had an easy regal air) andDan Swern (who also directed) inserted all sorts of nonsense,including wall-to-wall music (from an acoustic guitar slow jam on
Walk The Moon's "Shut Up and Dance" to recordings of George
Michael) and a food-themed dance that included tongs as castanets.</p>
<p>With couches and chairs lining the walls, the main stage is an open
rectangular space. So Swern's lighting in particular does heavy lifting
to create scene-setting and change of moods in concert with modest
props and costumes.
This version of Love's  Labour's  Lost,  to be true, offers no great shakes
in terms of insight -- just the usual hijinks a Shakespeare comedy can
make an excuse for. Yet time and again the momentum is rescued by
the flow of alcohol, a tasty bite and most of all a cast that rose abovethe dashed-off proceedings with a commitment to their parts and thatdifficult balance of not taking things too seriously but not clowning for
its own sake.
Darren Ritchie made a strong king and had the best chemistry of the
night w Sook. Mary Glen Fredrick and Alex Spieth made goodimpressions, even though the play as edited left them far feweropportunities to shine than the men. Not so Osbourne who was thereal clown of the night, popping in from various unexpected angles to
assay the silly Spaniard or a very fey courtier for the women (a trope
that proved tiresome to me until his good nature won me over). Likethe women, Oge Agulué made the most of a small part, bringing charmand wit to his turn as Longaville, the King's man who is wary of theentire "let's have no fun and just study" oath. But Matthew Goodrich
was the find for me, goofing and cavorting and yet taking very
seriously the romantic stakes. He convinced me this really was a playabout his character Berowne. (And he really needs a new headshotsince the one in the program doesn't do justice.) An understudy in
various Broadway shows, Goodrich will get his shot.
With another shot of Jäger I would have sworn that everyone in the
show will do the same! And that Shake  and  Bake  will run for years!
They'll get that break and leave the actor's lot of catering and
waitering far behind. The amusing (cruel?) irony is that here they have
a good showcase and STILL don't leave waitering behind. Here theyare delivering their lines while preparing food, serving it out, making ajoke to the audience while offering wine, declaring their love toanother character and then clearing a course away without breaking
stride. The fact that they maintained their dignity and made all this
stage business flow easily -- juggling lines and remembering whichperson at table 7 had the vegan option -- was a credit to the lot ofactors everywhere and a show that caters to their many talents.
