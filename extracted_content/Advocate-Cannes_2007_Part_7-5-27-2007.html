            <p>May 16, 2007All Boys Boarding SchoolCANNES -- May 16 morningA sneak peek at footage of St. Trinian's -- starring Rupert Everett indrag -- and a very in-demand party to promote it is an early highlightof the fest. So it's appropriate that I'm sharing an apartment for theten day festival with three other guys. Two of them are fest veterans Iknow well and one is here for the first time. The two guys areenjoyably straight -- casually slovenly but cleaner than most androughly my age. We've got a one bedroom apartment, with me andone guy on single beds in the bedroom and the other two guys using acouch or mattresses on the floor in the living room. The cost of thisluxurious living? $5000 for the entire festival, split four ways.We're located just three or four minutes of casual walking from thePalais. That's the central complex where many of the majorscreenings take place. (There are also dozens of screening rooms andtheaters showing movies of all shapes and sizes throughout thetown.) People always ask me about the topless beach but there isn'ttime. The first screening of the day is always a biggie and it takesplace at 8:30 am. From then on it's a roundelay of movies and pressconferences and interviews and photo shoots and parties.As cramped as it is, our apartment inspires jealousy with its centrallocation and the blessing of a washer and dryer. The new guy has justarrived and he's cute and smart and friendly and maybe 22 years oldand I don't know if he's gay but I'm certain his waist size is no biggerthan his age. I hate him already.-- Michael GiltzPosted at 08:24 PM in Cannes Film Festival, Film, Film Festivals |Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)Welcome To The Cannes Film FestivalVisit our other sitesAdvocate.comOut.comOutTraveler.comPopnographyAdvocate GenQMr SardonicAdvocate InsiderOut.com StyleListHereTV.comGayWired.comAdvertisement

<p>Photo: GettyCANNES -- May 15The Advocate has been covering the Cannes Film Festival for the lasteight years. Normally, that meant a three or four paragraph roundupin the magazine several weeks after the festival ended. This year, we'llhave daily posts with the buzz on movies, early reaction from thepress, our brief reviews, party coverage, sitting with the starsthumping movies they want us to hotly anticipate for the summer orfall and of course everything queer.Four thousand journalists converge on Cannes each May and it's notjust for the 22 films in Competition like Wong Kar Wai's MyBlueberry Nights wth Norah Jones, the Coen Brothers and theircomeback flick No Country For Old Men or Michael Moore's healthcare cri de coeur Sicko. Major stars like George Clooney and Brad Pittwill plug Ocean's 13, Angelina Jolie has her Oscar-hopeful turn in AMighty Heart, Jerry Seinfeld is promoting his animated bee flick andstarlets famous and unknown prowl the Croisette hopingphotographers will notice them. Among the gay events you can lookforward to: Rupert Everett reunites with Colin Firth in the all-girlsboarding school remake St. Trinian's. Rupert in drag as theheadmistress is catnip for the boys and the raucous St. Trinian'scomedies surely provided countless flights of fancy for girls back inthe day. Everett and Firth will hold forth at a press conference andthe St. Trinian's party should be an early highlight.The AmFar annual fund-raiser (with Sharon Stone as the cajoling,pleading and wonderfully demanding auctioneer) is a must-show forevery star in town and we're looking to squeeze in on the guest list.Director Gus Van Sant has a new tale of teens in trouble, ParanoidPark. Tom Kalin and Julianne Moore debut their wicked comicdrama Savage Grace. Actor Gael Garcia Bernal is making hisdirectorial debut -- and we're happy to have him behind the cameraas long as he introduces the film in person. And naturally most of thefilms with gay content will be a surprise: dozens of movies are seenfor the first time anywhere here at Cannes and hundreds moreappear at the Market, hoping for buyers.So keep coming back and I'll give you a glimpse of what it's like towalk the streets of Cannes during the biggest film festival in theIowa Caucus 2008LesbianMusicOutfest 2008PartiesPoliticsProvincetown Film Festival 2008Queen Mary 2 Historic CrossingReligionScienceSexSportsSydney Mardi Gras 2008Taylor Hanson for The AdvocateTelevisionThe DinahThe HRC Logo ForumThe L WordTheaterTravelRecent PostsMTV Video Music Awards...
