9/08/2004 02:42:00 PMUSA Today reports yet another attempt to prosecute the war on terrorhas collapsed due to government incompetence or the simple factthat they may have rushed to prosecute a "spy ring" when there wasno spy ring in the first place."Military prosecutors who accused an Air Force translator atGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, of taking part in a spy ring that tried to passmore than 200 secret documents to U.S. enemies now say that onlyone of the documents was secret, the Air Force said Tuesday."The prosecutors' move, six months after the collapse of a caseagainst a Muslim chaplain in the same probe, is fueling questionsabout whether there ever was a spy ring at Guantanamo."
