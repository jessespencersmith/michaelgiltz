CACTUS FLOWER  * out of ****
WESTSIDE THEATRE
So many things went wrong during one of the press
nights for the revival of this comedy directed by Michael
Bush, I thought perhaps we were seeing Noises Off  (a
show about a problem-plagued theater company) insteadof Cactus Flower.  Star Maxwell Caulfield struggled with
his lines (messing up one bit at the beginning about astewardess that should have had a pay-off at the veryend), a music cue blared into action too soon, and someprops clattered around. You might be tempted to dismissthis comedy as a tired work that was dated when itopened 35 years ago; it should have been left on the
shelf instead of (finally) being revived for the first significant production in New York, right? Except for
one notable exception.
I'd heard of the show but never saw it or the film adaptation. It certainly has a terrific pedigree. Cactus
Flower  was adapted from a French play by Abe Burrows (who should get a much happier revival with
How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying ). In it, a dentist tells his ditsy but sweet girlfriend
that he's married so she won't get serious. When he  gets serious, his nurse has to pretend to be his wife to
reassure the girl she's no home-wrecker. It's no surprise that the nurse loves her dentist and the nebbishywriter next door (Jeremy Bobb) loves the kooky girl. Complications ensue. Somehow, it was a smash hitand ran for more than 1200 performances. Lauren Bacall and Brenda Vaccaro starred, but they were bothshafted when it became a film and their roles were played by Ingrid Bergman (such a great comedianne!)

<p>and Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar, though even the trailer for the film is quite leaden. The film was a
smash hit too; one of the big hits of 1969/1970.
Caulfield plays the dentist here, jauntily running around the set to create a little energy (and perhaps joghis memory at times). For all I know Jenni Barber has never even seen the film, but her performance(not so bad) certainly evokes Hawn. The set by Anna Louizos is an all-purpose wooden affair that ismeant to double as an apartment, a dentist's office (the closest to success they come) and a nightclub.Despite all the flipping of posters and moving of furniture it remains stolidly, boringly familiarthroughout. Pop songs from the era punctuate every scene -- as the show progresses, they have a nominallink to the action (like playing "Born Free" when the nurse stands up to the dentist and walks out). But
that just underlines the many times when the songs feel random and without purpose, just a noisy way to
distract us from the lack of action.
So why the caveat? Because in the midst of this mess, Lois Robbins (a mainstay with roles on four
different soaps) somehow manages to deliver a solid, funny performance. While everyone else is playingfor laughs and delivering punch lines, Robbins is playing a character and delivering dialogue -- andnaturally, that means she garners most of the laughs. I don't mean to oversell her work here. Justmaintaining your dignity would be accomplishment enough. But Robbins is good enough to make me
think that -- who knows? -- maybe Cactus Flower  could be revived with the right attitude and cast, a la
Boeing Boeing.  Not that I'm eager to see it brought back anytime soon. But I am eager to see Robbins
again in a show that let's her show her real talent at its best.
