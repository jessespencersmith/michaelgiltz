8/04/2004 02:13:00 AMAnother New York Times article about that airline incident with thoseSyrian musicians is truly illuminating. The event was even lessworrying than it sounded, which makes the fact that the NYT includedit in a roundup of worrying incidents all the more annoying. Somereports made it sound as if when the plane was landing, the men alljumped up and took strategic positions. In fact, according to theFederal Air Marshall Service spokesperson, who previously hadn'tchallenged the wild tales flying around the internet -- the musicianswere already standing in the aisle when the seat belt signs wereilluminated, a flight attendant told them to sit down and they did.Much ado about nothing, harried on by passenger Annie Jacobsenwho wrote sensationalized accounts -- not backed up by any otherwitnesses or the undercover air marshall(s) on board. It should benothing, but watch this tale get repeated again and again.
