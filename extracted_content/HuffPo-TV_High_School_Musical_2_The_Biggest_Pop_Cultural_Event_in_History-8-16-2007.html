 High School Musical 2 :The
Biggest Pop Cultural Event in
History
Entertainment News
It's no surprise that the debut of High School
Musical 2  Friday at 8 p.m. has inspired a tidal
wave of press coverage. Almost every mediaoutlet in the country was slow in picking up onwhat a phenomenon HSM  was becoming and
now they need to make up for lost time. But thistween sensation should make that easy: it'salmost eerie how many trends in pop culture arereflected in the story of this film. To wit:
Musicals are Back  - For 26 years (since MTV
launched), virtually every kid in America has
grown up watching artists break into song and dance. The idea that they might find a musical odd
or off-putting is just crazy. And now everyone has caught on, thanks to the box office success ofmovies like Hairspray, Chicago, Dreamgirls, Once  (in its way), HSM  and a host of others. Further
proof: local live theater productions of HSM  have sprouted around the country.
Kids Love Repetition  - Every parent knows that kids like to hear the same story over and over
again. But HSM  took this to unprecedented extremes. Since the movie debuted in January of 2006,
the Disney Channel reran it again and again and again, always to millions of viewers - even after it
came out on DVD.
Cable TV Overwhelming Major Networks  - This summer reached a tipping point, with the
major networks churning out uninspired fare (like Pirate Master ) that reached fewer and fewer
viewers and cable channels delivering one audience grabber after another, from Army Wives  and
Damages  to Mad Men  and Flash Gordon . The major networks would kill to have a TV movie event
even remotely as anticipated as Disney's HSM2 .
A Star is (Almost) Born  - Zac Efron, the star of HSM , is clearly a breakout talent, thanks to a

Nanny Sues For
Alex Da Silva,
Celebrityrole in the feature film Hairspray . He's also done a not-so-good job of being gracious about it:
Efron has made some snarky comments about his co-stars and their pop albums and other career
decisions, pooh-poohed the concert tour by saying he'd get sick if he had to sing those songs every
night and generally giving the impression that he feels like he's already made it, when it's really
only HSM  that deserves that tag.
Digital Music Sales Eclipsing CD Sales  - It's a bold new world when the HSM  soundtrack
produced a record nine singles  on the Billboard Hot 100 -- all at the same time. In short, kids
watched the movie debut and then they walked straight over to their computers and downloaded as
many digital tunes from it that they could afford. No waiting till the next day to go to a record storeand buy the CD for these consumers.
Male Actors Objectified Just like the Gals Are  - Squeaky clean Efron is on the cover of
Rolling Stone  magazine  lifting up a white t-shirt, showing off his abs and stroking his chest. Yep,
male actors now realize they are fair game for eye candy just like women, no matter how young
they are.
The American Idol  Mania for Competition  - Don't forget, HSM  was all about auditions,
about two kids hoping to get cast in the lead roles for their school production. American Idol  has
turned auditions and competition into the defining rite of passage for an entire generation.Rolling Stone  Magazine is as Lost as the Music Industry  - Okay, Zac Efron may turn out to
be John Travolta for all we know (even though he didn't even sing his own songs in the original).
But the cover? Really? He's an appealing, talented kid. But it's hard to think of anything LESS rockand roll than the Disney Channel TV movie High School Musical and its sequel. It is the exactopposite of rock and roll.
People Still Love Pop Music - As much as the industry bemoans slowing music sales, the
disappearance of record chains across the country, and the lack of a hot new musical force (like the
Seattle scene) to get folks excited, the simple truth is that people still spend billions of dollars ayear on pop music like HSM , the best-selling album of 2006.
TV is the New Radio  - Radio stations are so bland and monomaniacal about playing the same
formatted batch of tunes whether you're in Miami, Florida or Minneapolis, Minnesota, that theysimply don't matter any more. Thank God for TV. No wonder the music supervisor on Grey's
Anatomy  got their own record label -- they've done a better job of spotting and promoting talent
like Snow Patrol and The Fray than most A&R folk.
Kids Expect a Multicultural World  - Our hero is super-white. His best bud is black. His
girlfriend is a sexy mix of Filipino, Chinese, Irish and Native American. And the "bad" girl's brother
seems to be a coded gay character. But kids don't blink twice. They expect their movies and TV to
look just like their world, where interracial dating and out teenagers are a banal fact of life.
The Atomization of our Culture - HSM  took so long to gain traction in the Traditional Media
because everyone is in a different room in the house, with mom watching Lifetime and dad
watching Ice Road Truckers  on the History Channel and neither of them having a clue that little
Suzie is obsessed with HSM . With literally something for everyone, can anything bring us together
the way, say, I Love Lucy  did in the 50s and The Cosby Show  did in the 80s?
Some Events Can Still Bring Us Together  - Don't worry. Something for everyone doesn't
mean everyone can't gather around the water-cooler every once in a while and talk about the sameevent. American Idol  may score lower ratings than  The Cosby Show  but it still pulls in a massive
audience. J.K. Rowling had people of all ages lined up at midnight to buy a book. And HSM2  made
enough noise that it won't be just tweens sitting in front of the TV to see HSM2  this weekend: their
parents will be there too to check out what all the fuss is over.
So, did I miss any trends encapsulated by High School Musical ?
