8/02/2004 09:17:00 AMWTF, as John would say. A front page story in the New York Timestoday highlights credible threats against major financial institutions inthe U.S. Halfway through the article, the writer says:"Several episodes in the United States have recently drawn scrutinyfrom counterterrorism officials, including the apprehension of aPakistani woman in Texas with a suspicious passport as well asreports from passengers on a recent flight to Los Angeles about oddactivity by a group of Syrian musicians. But officials said that neitherof these incidents was a direct factor in the decision to go to CodeOrange."Ohmigosh! A casual reader would believe these troubling eventsindicate terrorists are all over the U.S. getting ready to strike. Run forthe hills!But just a few days ago, the New York Times did a lenghty storyabout the Syrian musicians, making clear it was a case of culturalmisperceptions, that the men had been thoroughly questioned andinterviewed by three federal agencies and the LAPD and found to beexactly who they claimed to be. So how did a false alarm morph intoone of a string of disturbing incidents, much less one that the authortells us was not "a direct factor" in the decision to go to CodeOrange? Huh? Why would a panicky investigation of musicians thatproved to be nothing at all be any factor at all?It's irresponsible to investigate an incident, report that it was nothingat all, but then include it in a list of disturbing events that might havecontributed to the high alert the article has warned us about. If theNYT needs to retract its earlier article, it should. Otherwise, thisseemingly banal paragraph is misleading and dangerous. Moredangerous, in fact, than those musicians. Of course, this doesn't callinto question the report of heightened alert -- it calls into questionsthe NYT's coverage of that alert and how it conflates false alarms intoincidents of concern.
