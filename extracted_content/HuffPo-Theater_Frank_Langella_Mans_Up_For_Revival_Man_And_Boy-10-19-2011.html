 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Frank Langella Mans Up
For Revival "Man And Boy"
MAN AND BOY  * 1/2
AMERICAN AIRLINES
THEATRE /ROUNDABOUT
All credit to actor Frank Langella. Even in a flawedproduction of a flawed play, Langella manages to create
some emotional truth on stage, to entertain howeverbriefly the audience on hand while staying true to thecharacter. A pro, Langella makes the most of a scene
where he cannily takes the seat of a competitor, mines
the humor of "what fun!" and a simple "no" andgenerally does his best, from his first entrance to that
final squeeze-out-a-little-more-applause move at the
end of the curtain call.
Unfortunately, this production of Terence Ratigan's Man And Boy  gives even Langella precious little
opportunity to draw upon that talent. It's easy to see why the Roundabout chose to revive this 1963 work.It focuses on a Bernie Madoff financier of sorts whose paper empire is crumbling in dramatic fashion.Hoping to rescue a merger that might hide his financial sins (and hide from reporters), Gregor Antonescu
(Langella) retreats to the dingy basement apartment of his estranged son Basil (Adam Driver). Throw in
a closeted gay man, a deeply conflicted parent who despises attachment and you've got yourself a lot ofcontemporary hooks to draw in an audience.

<p>But not the way it's delivered here. Director Maria Aitken (who scored with The 39 Steps  and reportedly
staged Man and Boy  to acclaim in London with David Suchet) has an unfocused, unconvincing hand
here. Nothing works -- not the tepid romance between the secretive Basil and his girlfriend (Virginia
Kull), not the back-and-forth emotions between Basil and his father (Basil keeps insisting he despises theman; everyone else keeps telling him he loves the old bastard) and certainly not the clumsy set by Derek
McLane which clumps the action of the bedroom center stage, right in the middle of the living room in a
confusing, unsatisfying manner.
The one respite is a scene with the powerful executive Mark Herries (Zach Grenier) who might be able to
restart the failed merger. Gregor has dug up incriminating info about Herries and a male lover whocommitted suicide. Delighting in the sort of risks that thrill gamblers (as opposed to businessmen),
Gregor drops little hints here and there that lead Herries to believe 1) Gregor knows about the gay double
life Herries leads; 2) Gregor is gay himself; 3) that Gregor's son - who goes by Anthony and is cautionednot to refer to Gregor as his dad -- is in fact a male lover; 4) and that Herries would be doing Gregor a
favor if he "entertained" this young man at a future date. And all of it is accomplished with Basil aware
that something odd is going on but remaining clueless.
Not all the humor and twistedness of this moment is captured (and Rattigan is no Joe Orton, who could
have had a blast with the set-up). But it's a rare passage when the show comes fitfully to life. Otherwise,it's as dreary as that Greenwich Village walk-down apartment, from the uninteresting romance at thebeginning to the melodramatic yet dull finale. Langella may be a magician on stage, but even magicians
need the proper set-up, props and assistants to make their illusions truly come to life.
