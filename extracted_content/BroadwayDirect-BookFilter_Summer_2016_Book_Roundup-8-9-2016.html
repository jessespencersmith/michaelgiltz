great books about the theater. So whether you’re participating in local community theater,
planning a trip to a major city to catch a touring production, or heading to Broadway, you’ll wantto have these titles on hand for reading pleasure. Here’s a roundup of the best titles that havejust hit stores this summer.

BOOKFILTER’S BEST OF SUMMER PICKS
MICHAEL GILTZ  | AUGUST 9, 2016
SHARE</p>
<p>out and hard to find? Well, millions of copies of this new play inspired by the
work of J.K. Rowling are being printed, so it shouldn’t be a problem to snapup a copy. But if there’s any play that could create that sort of frenzy, it’sthe strongly reviewed new story about Harry Potter. Remarkably, demandwas so high they didn’t even wait for the London production to open. This isthe rehearsal edition, so there’s sure to be an official, final version somewhere down the road.(Has that ever happened before in history? A play being published even before it’s actuallyfinished?) One review of the show itself caught our imagination: Variety  said the novels turned a
generation on to reading, and now Rowling could turn them on to theatregoing as well. Indeed,for the first time in their lives, many people will be reading a play for pure pleasure, not just
because it was assigned to them in school. Magical, indeed. Learn more.
SOME ENCHANTED EVENINGS: THE GLITTERING LIFE AND TIMES OF MARY MARTIN
By David Kaufman$29.99, St. Martin’s Press
It’s a heck of a life. Mary Martin is forever immortalized as Peter Pan  on TV.
But as with so many great stars of the theater, her best work lives on only in
memory. Theater critic David Kaufman’s well-reviewed new biographydescribes an exciting and rocky life both on and off the stage. Martinsoared to fame singing “My Heart Belongs to Daddy” for Cole Porter butquickly proved she was no one-hit wonder: South Pacific, The Sound ofMusic  and I Do, I Do  made Martin the biggest star of her day, alongside
Ethel Merman. She abandoned her son, Larry Hagman, served as a beard for her closetedsecond husband … or did he serve as a beard for her? It’s a juicy, riveting life filled with greattriumph and, of course, occasional heartbreak. Alongside that holiday classic Peter Pan  and all
those cast albums, this is a key piece of Martin’s legacy. Learn more.
VINEGAR GIRL
By Anne Tyler</p>
<p>$25, Hogarth
A modern spin on Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew,  this is the latest in a
series of novels commissioned to take the Bard’s work and put those stories
in a new setting. Here, Pulitzer Prize winner Tyler turns Kate into thedaughter of an eccentric scientist and preschool teacher. After years offrustration, her dad is on the verge of a breakthrough; unfortunately, hisirreplaceable lab assistant, Pyotr, is about to be deported. Kate’s notmarried and, sure, Pyotr is insufferable, but couldn’t she just do the deed toget him a green card? Hey, since Shakespeare often borrowed his plots from earlier sources,
turnabout is fair play, especially when it’s the acclaimed Tyler doing the borrowing. Learn more.
I WANNA BE A PRODUCER
By John Breglio$29.99, Applause Theatre & Cinema Books
You wanna be a producer? Actually, what do you really want? Do you want
to be among the crowd onstage when a new play wins the Tony, or do youwant to inspire bold new work, or do you want to be a smart investor andmake money while getting to be involved with theater? Producer andentertainment lawyer John Breglio has seen it all, and this memoir/handbookwill be devoured by theater buffs whatever their goal. If you want to be aplayer, he’s got dos and don’ts. If you want to peek behind the curtains andsee how Broadway really works, he’s got the details about the hard work that goes intomounting revivals of Dreamgirls  and A Chorus Line,  and decades of work as a lawyer. And if
you want stories, he has crossed paths with everyone from Michael Bennett to StephenSondheim and August Wilson to Patti LuPone. It’s neither fish nor fowl, really, much like the job
of a Broadway producer. Learn more.
A COUNTRY ROAD, A TREE 
By Jo Baker$26.95, Knopf
Author Jo Baker scored a huge hit with her novel Longbourn,  which retold</p>
<p>the events of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice  from the point of view of the
servants. Now Baker delves into real life with A Country Road, A Tree.  The
time is World War II and budding playwright Samuel Beckett has come to
Paris, determined to set the theatrical world on fire. Unfortunately, the Nazishave also arrived and they’re determined to set the real world on fire.Beckett joins the resistance and witnesses horrors while wrestling internallywith the new type of theater he is determined to create. Take your pick: It’s a riveting story ofspies and intrigue, or it’s the crucible in which great art is formed. Really, it’s both, and it’s abold new work from a writer who has proved especially adept at finding fresh, unexpected
angles on familiar events. Learn more.
THEATER OF FEAR AND HORROR 
By Mel Gordon$24.95, Feral House
First published in 1988, this long out-of-print look at the Grand Guignol style
of melodramatic mayhem in Paris is back and expanded in a new edition.Popular for more than 50 years, Grand Guignol was “lowbrow” theater and— you won’t be surprised to hear — wildly popular. Gordon describes itsrise and fall in a colorfully illustrated book that might have just been an eye-catching coffee table book but is in fact a serious and substantial work ofscholarship. New to this edition are more Grand Guignol posters, anautobiographical sketch of one Grand Guignol star called “I Am the Maddest Woman in theWorld,” and three scripts of actual works. If you need a birthday gift for John Waters, here’s just
the thing. Learn more.
SIX KIDS AND A STUFFED CAT
By Gary Paulsen$16.99, Simon & Schuster Books for Younger Readers
Author Paulsen is one of the most honored writers of books for kids working</p>
<p>today. Hatchet  — his story of a teen boy surviving in the wilderness — is
one of those go-to novels perfect for kids who think they don’t like reading.
Now Paulsen has delivered this comic work about a storm striking a localschool. Everyone is forced to take refuge in a safe space and stay there.The result? Six kids are crammed together in a bathroom and must spendhours dealing with one another. Think The Breakfast Club but smellier.Here’s the catch: Paulsen has told the story and then included a script, so any six kids canperform this piece together, making it both an entertaining comic novel and a perfect
introduction to the pleasures of live theater. Learn more.
THEN & NOW
By Barbara Cook$28.99, Harper
Director Mike Nichols compared one especially brilliant concert series by
singer and actress Barbara Cook to Judy Garland’s legendary Carnegie Hallshows. Having been there as well, I heartily agree. One of the greats, withthe Tony and Kennedy Center honor to show for it, Cook is a peerlessinterpreter of classic tunes from Rodgers and Hammerstein to, of course,Stephen Sondheim. Though effortlessly commanding on stage, Cook had adifficult life, having been abandoned by her beloved father and surviving thecontrolling neediness of her probably unstable mother, to overcoming the alcoholism thatplagued both Cook and her marvelous accompanist Wally Harper. She bares all in this memoir,and ardent fans will surely savor the passages that deal with that famously challenging aria fromCandide  and her prickly friendship with Elaine Stritch. Cook is always hardest on herself as she
charts her career. A “natural” singer who has studied and honed her craft to perfection, Cook isfar from a natural raconteur, à la Stritch. But it’s welcome as a hint to the complicated,challenging life she led, even if her soul remains bared most beautifully on stage, in song.

<p>JOHN
By Annie Baker
$30, Theatre Communications Group
Playwright Annie Baker won the Pulitzer Prize for her seemingly real-time
look at ushers working in a movie theatre. She wasted no time in following itup with a subtler, stranger, and bolder work called John . It’s set in a bed-
and-breakfast near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, with the proprietor embodiedto goofy perfection by Georgia Engel. A couple come to stay, bicker, andsomehow it’s all a lot more mysterious and disconcerting and sad than anymere description can convey. This is the complete text of the newest work
by one of the best playwrights around. Learn more.
 
MY LIFE WITH WAGNER
By Christian Thielemann$27.95, Pegasus
Christian Thielemann is one of the most acclaimed conductors in the world
and is especially known for his devotion to and understanding of the work ofWagner. Here, Thielemann offers both a memoir of sorts and a detailed lookat what it’s like to tackle and explore and interpret one of the greatestcomposers of all time. He offers insight into the extraordinarily high level ofmusicianship needed just to begin playing Wagner and how a conductorand orchestra work in partnership to bring the music to life. For serious fans
of opera, this work is essential. Learn more.
 
THE KENTUCKY CYCLE
By Robert Schenkkan$16, Grove Press
Maybe now The Kentucky Cycle  will get its due. This nine-part epic won the</p>
<p>Pultizer Prize before even playing in New York City (the first time in history
that happened). It came to Broadway. Kevin Costner was set to direct andstar in an adaptation for HBO. And then … nothing. The show opened andclosed, overshadowed by Angels in America.  The HBO miniseries came to
naught. And while such things aren’t always easy to determine, TheKentucky Cycle  doesn’t seem to have flourished in regional productions
(though surely it’s been done). Playwright Robert Shenkkan proved he was no fluke: He’s wonEmmy nominations for work on the miniseries The Pacific,  has a feature film due out in
November, and, of course, enjoyed a remarkable triumph with the LBJ play All the Way  starring
Bryan Cranston. (The sequel is headed to Broadway as well.) So perhaps now, finally, thiscollection of nine one-acts about life in Kentucky that encompasses three families, 200 years,and six hours on stage can enter the canon. At the very least, it’s now available to read in a
handsome new edition. Learn more.
THE LISTENER
By Rachel Basch$14.95, Pegsasus
This novel is so rich in ideas, it boggles the mind. That’s certainly the case
for the protagonist Malcolm, a widowed therapist who has raised twodaughters on his own while working at the Center for Behavioral Health atBaxter College. He takes on a new female patient, only to realize she is infact a patient he’s already worked with. Only then is the patient identified asNoah. A student at Baxter, Noah is exploring his gender identity, all while(perhaps?) romancing Malcolm and tackling a role in the campus musical.Male, female, gay, straight, Freud, Jung, Sondheim Schwartz — these are the opposite polesthat author Basch explores so fully in this acclaimed new novel. And where better to findyourself than on stage taking on the role of someone else, if only for a while? It’s a lesson Noah
learns and teaches with style. Learn more.</p>
