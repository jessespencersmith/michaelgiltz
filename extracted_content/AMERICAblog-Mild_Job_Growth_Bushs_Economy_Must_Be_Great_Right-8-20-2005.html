8/20/2005 05:32:00 PMBush's tepid job growth -- far lower than almost every quarterduring Clinton's presidency -- is being seized on as evidencethe economy is picking up steam.The report, from the Labor Department, says there are newjobs - that hiring at the end of last year was the strongestsince June 2002 and that employers at last added topayrolls in earnest. In the fourth quarter of 2004, thenation gained 8.1 million jobs, the most since the firstquarter of 2002, according to the report.What they're not detailing in this summary: what kind of jobs arebeing created, part-time work with no benefits? How many arefreelancers with no benefits or vacation time at all? How many ofthese are second jobs? A growing trend among the middle class inmiddle America and the poor on the coasts is people holding downtwo or three jobs just to make ends meet. So if you work full-time atWal-Mart and need to get a second job just to stay out of debtorsprison, that's somehow good news because another job has been"created."Another point to remember:Among the most comprehensive employment figuresavailable, the data confirm what less rigorous surveys havesuggested and what the monthly employment figures haveonly hinted at. (While the monthly job report is based onsurveys of employers and households, the figures releasedyesterday cover roughly 98 percent of the work force.)When there's a discrepancy between a survey covering 98% of thework force and a survey covering 100% of employers andhouseholds, be wary of people who prefer the mildly "positive" newscoming from the less complete data.So how is your financial situation? Anyone working two jobs?
