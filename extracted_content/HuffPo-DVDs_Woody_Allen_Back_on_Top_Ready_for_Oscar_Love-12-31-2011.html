 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVD: Woody Allen Back on Top,
Ready for Oscar Love
Oh the DVDs are piling up, and these are the dog days of late December and early January when DVD
releases slow to a trickle. Let's get to it.
MIDNIGHT IN PARIS  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony) -- Director Woody Allen has often expressed
bemusement about why some films are embraced by the public and others don't click, and it rarely alignswith his own assessment. I'm with you on this one, Woody. Why Midnight in Paris  should become the
highest grossing film in his career is beyond me. (Keep in mind, I am not adjusting for inflation but thisMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>is still a very successful film.) It's one of the mild late period Woodys, not so godawful that it makes you
like his work less but by no means strong. The story -- modest SPOILER -- is a banal look at a Hollywood
screenwriter with a miserable marriage who wishes he could have been in Paris during its 20s heyday.
Presto, he gets his wish and rubs elbows with Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and the like. The movie soon
reduces to simply introducing new historical figures as if their very presence was amusing. Look!
Toulouse-Lautrec! In an embarrassing finale, our hero ignores the adult woman his own age who actually
seems interesting (Carla Bruni) and goes off with a minor character who is little barely out of her teens.
The timing of the DVD release is good because it puts the movies in the hands of Oscar voters just as
they're filling out their ballots. Audiences and older Oscar members ate this up so I expect this will be oneof Woody's best showings come nomination, with Picture, Director, Screenplay all in play and perhaps anacting nod for Kathy Bates, though that's a long shot. Owen Wilson is actually a good Woody, but thefilm is paper-thin if harmless.
ARCHER  SEASON TWO  ($39.99 BluRay; FOX) -- My favorite sitcom on TV stumbled out of the gate
for an episode or two but soon redeemed itself and built on the silly, raunchy and hilarious work ofseason one. The voice cast is simply terrific -- special kudos to... well everyone, including H. JonBenjamin, Judy Greer, Jessica Walter, Chris Parnell and the rest. If any voice cast deserved to be
nominated for acting Emmys, these are the guys. The setup of a super agent spy that works for an
independent company run by his mom remains surprisingly rich in bringing new life to familiar
situations like office politics and the like. Sexy, hilarious and you'll want to watch it again and again.
DOLPHIN TALE  ($35.99 BluRay combo; Warner Bros.) -- This year hasn't been a total wash for the
talented Harry Connick Jr. He released a live album of his Broadway concert show in March. Now at theend, he is stranded on the Great White Way in the woebegone rethought revival of On A Clear Day YouCan See Forever.  But in between he enjoyed a solid family hit with this movie about a kid who finds an
injured dolphin and convinces Connick Jr. to help the animal make it back into the ocean. The big namesinclude Kris Kristofferson, Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, but it's Connick, the kid and the dolphinfront and center.

<p>DESIGN FOR LIVING  ($39.95 BluRay and $29.95 DVD; Criterion) -- This isn't pure Ernst Lubitsch
because it's based on a Noel Coward play. But this pre-Code romp allows Lubitsch to add his light touch
to a frothy, slightly risque tale of Miriam Hopkins refusing to choose between writer Frederick March andpainter Gary Cooper. Cooper is about as convincing as a painter as I would be as a football lineman andthis lighter than light comedy isn't quite his speed. But it's presented with care and the extras are great asalways with Criterion, including a short starring Charles Laughton that Lubitsch directed and an entire1964 British TV production of the play introduced by Noel Coward for comparison sake.
KUNG FU PANDA 2  ($49.99 BluRay combo; DreamWorks)
DETECTIVE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME  ($29.95 BluRay; Vivendi) --
Kung Fu Panda  was better than I expected and the sequel wasn't quite as good as I hoped. But both are
fun, entertaining flicks. KFP2  was painted as a disappointment at the box office but in fact it grossed
even more than the original worldwide. Since they both hit more than $600 million, you can bet therewill be a KFP3 . Detective Dee  is pure martial arts fantasy flash, with an empty action mystery presented
with superior flare. It's fun if you check your mind at the door and don't mind implausibility and emptyspectacle. Just wait for the action scenes, though post- Crouching Tiger , we expect more.

RetweetSleep Better: How To Use All Your
Senses To Promote Sleep
http://t.co/1UxSV5oG  /via @heykim
pattonoswalt
RetweetOh man. Gorgeous, touching
obituary for Tony Scott by
@KevinFCorrigan . This one's a gut-
punch: http://t.co/ajVp7K1L</p>
<p>THE BORGIAS  SEASON ONE  ($65.99 BluRay; Showtime/Paramount) -- Whether you're jonesing for
The Sopranos  or The Tudors,  this costume drama about the sleazy, power-mad Borgias (led by an oily
Jeremy Irons) delivers the goods according to my brother Chris, who recommends it highly. Overseen by
director Neil Jordan who planned a feature film for years but decided he needed a wider -- bigger?Lengthier? -- canvas in which to do the story justice.
SEVEN CHANCES  ULTIMATE EDITION  ($29.95; Kino) -- The specialty label Kino has been on an
extraordinary tear recently, putting out DVD after DVD devoted the shorts and films of Buster Keaton.He's practically their mascot. Lucky him and lucky us because that means we have access to top-notchprints of some of the best comedies of all time. Seven Chances  is the one where Keaton must get married
to inherit millions and we get the famous shot of him running down a street being chased by seeminglythousands of women in wedding gowns. It's surreal and unforgettable. The strong extras include twomore shorts devoted to quickie marriages, including a Three Stooges entry, audio commentary byhistorians Ken Gordon and Bruce Lawton and more.</p>
<p>THE DEBT  ($29.98; Universal/Focus) 
BRIGHTON ROCK  ($24.98; IFC) -- Helen Mirren is always good, even if the movies she is in don't
quite click. The Debt  is an unnecessary remake of a fine Israeli film anchored by good performances by
Mirren and It Girl Jessica Chastain as the same character at different points in her life. Brighton Rock is
a necessary remake that bungles the chance. An earlier version by Carol Reed wasn't faithful enough to
the tale by Graham Greene so here was a chance to get it right. Nope. Written and directed by Rowan
Joffe, it exhibits none of the subtlety he showed on Last Resort  (a gem) or even the George Clooney flick
The American  (which I'm also not fond of). The cast is certainly top-notch. Sam Riley (from Control )
plays Pinkie, the young thug desperate to cover up a murder and maintain control of his gang. Helen
Mirren is Ida, the tea shop owner who suspects the worse of him and is determined to get justice. AndreaRiseborough is the timid but determined Rose. Only Riseborough's character captures the character onthe page. The first big problem is the casting: the two leads are good but Pinkie and his girl are supposedto be 17 and 16 years-old. Yet Riley is 30 years-old and Riseborough nearly 29. There's a world ofdifference between those ages. And the time has been moved from the late 30s to the early 60s, whichmakes their older age all the more significant. A 29-year-old woman in 1964 is a far different creaturethan a 16-year-old girl in 1938. It throws the entire film off balance. Pinkie's most notable aspect in thebook is his disinterest and even disgust with sex and women in general, though he's not necessarily gayso much as creepily asexual. Other than a small twitch in his cheek when he kisses Rose, that crucial lackof humanity is lost. MIrren's character is changed even more. In the book, she's so compelling (andfrightening to Pinkie) precisely because her desire to see justice done over the dead man is so random.She doesn't know the victim from Adam, really. In the movie he's a dear friend so her motivation isunderstandable and thus less disturbing. So without these insights, what are we left with? A young thugand his gal driven to despair by a nosy woman and their past crimes, all of it laid on thick with an over-
the-top score that warns of doom and gloom and eternal judgment at every turn. They even change the
ending to avoid Greene's final hammer blow to optimism. Not even false hope has a place in his world.
What a missed opportunity.
MICHAEL FEINSTEIN: THE SINATRA LEGACY  ($24.98; Image) -- Feinstein is more of a curator
than a performer, but his sincerity can win you over. This tribute to Sinatra and other Sinatra-era singers
is nothing if not worshipful and peppered with anecdotes about the artists and the songs. Feinsteindoesn't convince me when he swings (here he's backed by a full orchestra) but on the quiet moments hecaptures a unique, sensitive style finely tuned to the lyrics that serves him very well, such as on thestand-out track "So in Love." The quieter the better. On the positive side, the direction and editing isn'tmanic so you get a good sense of the show without constantly whip-cutting from camera to camera. Asolid record of his work and if you like him you'll certainly like this.</p>
<p>VIETNAM IN HD  ($34.95 BluRay; History/A&E/New Video) -- the first series World War II in Color
seemed like an interesting gimmick. They kept coming thanks to big ratings and now we have Vietnam in
HD.  Really? What's next? World War II in 3-D?  (Yes, actually!) Putting aside the meaningless hook, this
is Vietnam seen through home movies and other footage alongside the stories of 13 people who werethere. Fine as far as it goes, but nothing you haven't heard before.
TWO MINUTES TO GLORY  ($19.99; NFL/Vivendi) -- If you're a football junkie, the NFL is
determined to package and repackage its footage in every way imaginable. I love the complete Super Bowl
sets. But these themed highlight reels are more suspect. They're fine for killing time on TV but do youreally need to own more than two hours devoted to analyzing and celebrating the greatest last minutedrives in NFL history? You do? Let me get out of your way.</p>
<p>VELVET GOLDMINE  ($19.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)
NOTHING SACRED  ($24.95 ; Kino)
CITY OF GOD ($19.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)
A FAREWELL TO ARMS  ($24.95 ; Kino)
HEAVENLY CREATURES  ($19.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)
TORA! TORA! TORA!  ($34.98 BluRay; FOX)
SHERLOCK HOLMES  ($34.95 ; Kino) -- Velvet Goldmine  looks better all the time. It's a wacky
updating of Citizen Kane, with the mysterious figure a Bowie-like glam rock star played well by EwanMcGregor. I'd love to think some fans of the Dark Knight will watch this Christian Bale film and discoverhe's enamored by this god of pansexual freedom. Great soundtrack, too! Nothing Sacred  is a long
overdue decent print of a very fun Carole Lombard comedy that satirizes a public's hunger for scandal.Some things never change. City Of God  remains a vivid crime flick about the struggle to survive in Rio.
No wonder it spun off a sequel and a TV series. Gary Cooper tackles Hemingway and since he's soreticent in general you'd think the fit would be better for A Farewell To Arms . But they both get tamped
down here. Peter Jackson unintentionally helped make the case for his directing  The Lord Of The Rings
via the fantasy sequences in this lurid, fascinating tale Heavenly Creatures,  the story of two girls urging
each other on to murder. Tora! Tora! Tora!  is dutifully accurate in depicting the events leading up to
Pearl Harbor. It makes the Michael Bay Pearl Harbor  seem positively sprightly in comparison but the
BluRay is handsome. Finally, John Barrymore doesn't quite ham it up as Holmes in this 1922 silent filmversion of a popular stage play that is somehow off just a tad, making the whole exercise not nearly asfun as it should be.

Midnight In Paris is a gem. This guy just didn't get it.
08:06 AM on 01/01/2012
I couldn't agree with you more, re: Midnight In Paris. As a somewhat embarrassingly devoted
Woody fan who has even defended "Anything Else" and "Everyone Says I Love You"---I really didenjoy both--"Midnight In Paris" was cute, but nothing more. I just don't get the accolades. Why this
film, over say, "Hollywood Ending," which had twice as many laughs," became the success that it
did, is mind-boggling. All those clever appearances by Hemingway and the Fitzgeralds had thepotential to be riotous with some classic Woody writing. Instead, each historical figure said exactlywhat you'd think they'd say. "I'm Dali! Dali!" Epic fail. Still, on second viewing, I enjoyed it a bit moreas a whole, but still the laughs were few and far between. 
And to Plus15, so you're saying what? One must be a filmmaker in order to form an opinion on a
film? Or a musician before one can like or dislike Bob Dylan? Just curious.

With all due respect, Mr Allen - who was hands down the best American filmmaker of thelast quarter of the 20th century - has not made a quality film in the 21st century. His last fully realized work was "Sweet & Lowdown" in 1999. After that he fell off an artistic
cliff, never to recover.
06:33 AM on 01/01/2012
Of course relative to Michael Giltz adjusting the classic phrase a bit: those who can do, those who
can't become critics - fits like a glove.Recency   | Popularity

Plus 15, I'd be more interested to hear what you do or don't like about a particular film or
TV show than simply insisting that only people who have worked on commercially releasedmovies are allowed to review or form an opinion on them or only published authors shouldreview books or only people in bands that have toured outside their home town talk about
music. That's always been a rather silly idea, proven by the fact that I imagine you have
voiced an opinion on movies or music or TV or theater or novels in your lifetime and
presumably not done more than one of them professionally), and if you have, congrats!
By the way, does playing Tiny Tim in grade school count as doing? I limped nicely andthink I delivered the awkward line "God bless us everyone!" quite well actually; not a dryeye in the house.

Woody Allen back on top! Does that mean he's found a new sweet young thing to bed and wed?

Midnight in Paris was a darling movie.
