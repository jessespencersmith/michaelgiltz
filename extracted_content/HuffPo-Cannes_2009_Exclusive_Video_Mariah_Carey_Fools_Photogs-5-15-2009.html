 Cannes Exclusive Video: Mariah
Carey Fools Photogs!

Mariah Carey made the paparazzi look foolish
today at the Cannes Film Festival. At first, it
looked like a scene straight out of La Dolce Vita .
Mariah Carey pops out of the Hotel Carlton and
crosses the street to attend the press conference
for the acclaimed indie film Precious,  which has
just debuted here to more strong reviews after
dominating Sundance. Like a true diva, Careyappeared at 2:15 p.m, a good 45 minutes after the
press conference was supposed to start.
Cameramen and photographers stood around inthe drizzling rain, climbing on street signs or
benches to get a better angle for the big moment. Then a clamor erupted from the Hotel Carlton."Mariah! "Mariah!" A scrum of photographers surrounded her as she walked just a few yardsacross the street and towards the beach dining area. Women were crushed momentarily against
the barricades as Carey got closer and closer, with the guards trying to let Carey in and keep the
photographers out. Barely acknowledging them, she slipped past everyone and scurried down thestairs and out of sight. The only problem? That's not Mariah Carey.

In fact, it was a body double. While the photographers stood in the wet rain from about 1 until 2:15
p.m., the real Mariah Carey popped up at the press conference by some secret tunnel, professional
and polite and right on the dot at 1:30 p.m. She smiled and answered every question along with her
costars and director Lee Daniels. (She also stars in the Daniels film Tennessee , which opens in the
US on June 5.) Precious , based on the acclaimed novel by Sapphire, opens November 6 via
Lionsgate.
Carey has a small but important role as a social worker and she appears in a scene with comedian
and actress Mo'Nique that has a chance of garnering that actress an Oscar nomination come next
January. With the prominent support of Oprah Winfrey AND Tyler Perry, it's also likely to make afool of the New York Times  for saying the inspirational but gritty tale was good but almost
impossible to market to a wide audience.
Carey is also working on a new album. After the press conference, she really did pose for the
photographers on their way out. Or did she? You can never be certain.
