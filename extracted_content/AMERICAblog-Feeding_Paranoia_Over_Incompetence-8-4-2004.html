8/04/2004 03:01:00 AMSo now Bush officials are backing off Monday's backing off over theurgency of the terror alert and saying, um, actually, we have verycurrent scary information about a possible terrorist attack and that'swhy we raised the alert level to orange. So why the hell did they sendmixed signals on Monday?Rule #1: Don't make political plugs for the President's reelectionwhen announcing a terrorist alert! It undermines your authority andmakes reasonable people question your motives.Rule #2: Don't back off from the seriousness of the alert if you havecompelling, current information. If people realize some of it is old,just say there is also information that is separate and very currentand compelling. This threat should be taken very seriously.End of story. And then we wouldn't have had three days of back andforth and confusion.
