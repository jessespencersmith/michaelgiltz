From the Publisher: From the Booker short-listed author of Jamrach's
Menagerie  comes the extraordinary, moving, and unsettling tale of a
woman, branded a freak from birth, who becomes an internationalsensation but longs for genuine human connection  London had the best
freaks, always had. The Egyptian Hall, the Promenade of Wonders, theSiamese twins, pinheads, midgets, cannibals, giants, living skeletons, the
fat, the hairy, the legless, the armless, the noseless, London had seen it
all. In the Hall of Ugliness the competition was stiff. But noone had everseen anything quite like Julia . . .  Pronounced by the most eminent
physician of the day to be "a true hybrid wherein the nature of womanpresides over that of the brute," Julia Pastrana stood apart from the other
carnival acts. She was fluent in English, French and Spanish, an
accomplished musician with an…

What We Say
Freaks have always fascinated and the memorable Julia Pastrana is unquestionably a freak. Born in the mountains of Mexico,
she is sheltered by a local bigwig and grows up mostly hidden from the world. But the world comes to her and wonders, isshe human? Animal? The Missing Link? Some deviant spawn of a man and an orangutang? For Julia speaks several languages,
sings and dances quite well and is as hairy as an ape, sporting a face that makes people gasp in its simian appearance. Is
she real? Julia wonders herself. In Carol Birch's quietly unnerving novel, Birch does one thing in particular very, very well:she never lets us forget for a moment that both Julia and everyone around her is always aware of her appearance, eitherShare This Book

<p>studiously avoiding comment or delighting in it or disturbed and obsessed by it or a million other reactions. But indifferent?
Never. Not a page goes by without some comment or action, some word or gesture, some stray thought by Julia and
strangers or even friends ("That mouth! Those lips!") which reminds you again and again that she is ineluctably different. It
is exhausting and pitying and sad and one never becomes inured to it, any more than Julia can. She travels the world andfinds fame and fortune and even happiness of a sort -- sort of -- with her manager Theodore Lent, who is as uncertain of hisown motives as Julia or anyone else. Author Birch gets under your skin and remains there without ever becomingsentimental or letting you off the hook by striving to see "beyond" who and what Julia is -- she never can, so why should
we? There's a minor, secondary plot set in the present that ties in both symbolically and literally to this tale. It's not a
flaw, but I was never quite convinced it was necessary, either. The novel is based loosely on a real woman named JuliaPastrana, as an end note tells us. And if that doesn't send you to Google where you can call up her image and stare andstare, well then you're a better person than me. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
An IndieNext List and USA Today  Pick
“Think  Love Potion #9  meets  The Night Circus  and yet wholly unique and fantastic in its own right.”
--Marie Claire
"If readers can resist looking Pastrana up on the internet before finishing the novel, they will be rewarded by
the sort of bizarre twist that can happen only in real life. ...enjoyable and moving"
--The Financial Times
 
"Roll up, roll up, for a beautifully written novel about the poignant inner life of 19th-century touring freakshowattraction Julia Pastrana"--The Guardian
“Birch’s novel does more than tell the story of a woman and performer, it brings to light the dangers of
exploitation and dehumanization. With great sensitivity and compassion, Birch reclaims Julia Pastrana’s
humanity and offers an opportunity to see this woman the way she should have been seen more than 150 years
ago.”--Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
"A strange, transfixing novel....gorgeously written... Orphans of the Carnival  is about how we can find humanity
in all fellow creatures, which is surely a message worth pondering now…
