<p>THE TOURIST  ($38.96 BluRay or $28.95 regular DVD; Sony) -- This Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie
romantic thriller is curiously mellow, if not downright sleepy. I blame Venice. In Paris, you might careen
around the city in a snazzy sports car, tires squealing. In Venice, when Jolie rushes to a new location viacanal, the boat of course slowly slides next to the dock and Jolie calmly walks onto the pier. You just
can't create a sense of excitement when gently parking a boat. Jolie is the lover of a dashing, mysterious
man who has ripped off a Russian mobster for billions and is wanted by both the bad guys and the cops.
Jolie is being followed by everyone, so she lures a vacationing math teacher (Depp, the most dashing
math teacher since at least Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind ) and fools everyone into thinking Depp is
the mysterious man they want. Depp remains bizarrely calm throughout the entire film. "Why are people
shooting at me?" he might ask, in a low murmur that barely rises above a whisper. Jolie spends the entirefilm posing and looking back over her shoulder with movie star aplomb. The director's first film was thequiet German drama The Lives Of Others  but he is sorely out of his depth here. It's the type of film you
probably skipped in the theaters but might just rent or buy on DVD, thinking with these stars, how badcan it be? Pretty bad, actually.
THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- I'm glad the Oscar-winning drama
Milk  exists. It was made with love and surely reached a lot more people with the inspiring, fascinating
story of pioneering gay activist Harvey Milk. But artistically, there's no comparison between that film andthis classic documentary. Everything was said here, and better. Indeed, the best moments of the filmincluded real footage of memorial services for Milk that you can see here in a way that makes them all themore moving. This 1984 was groundbreaking for discussing modern gay life in such a matter of factmanner and Milk is colorful and hilarious and best of all, effective in getting his message across about
dignity and respect for all Americans. Criterion can be trusted to provide an excellent print and insightful
extras, including bonus interview footage, a piece on the film Milk, a panel discussion on the trial ofMilk's killer (which employed the famous Twinkie defense) and more. Landmark.
JACKSON COUNTY JAIL/CAGED HEAT!  ($19.93; Shout) -- Most of producer Roger Corman's
movies are -- how should I put this? Bad. But they often have a B-movie silliness about them andCorman did give so many talented young filmmakers a break (though not much of a salary) that

<p>genuinely fun bad movies appear more than you would expect. This double bill is a perfect example, with
the women-in-prison genre getting two feverish workouts. Caged Heat! in particular was directed by
Jonathan Demme and shot by Tak Fujimoto, who have fun sharing their stories on the audio
commentary. Who knew these drive-in flicks would ever get treated with such respect?
SKYLINE  ($39.98 BluRay and $29.98 regular DVD; Universal) 
YOGI BEAR  ($35.99 BluRay combo and $28.98 regular DVD; Warner Bros.) -- These two movies have
nothing in common except that they're both among the worst-reviewed movies of the year and both
made a good amount of money. Yogi Bear  in particular had solid legs, so somebody must have liked it.
Skyline was made by people who were also involved with Battle: Los Angeles. They finished that bigger
budget movie and then ran off and made a similar film for pennies. The lawsuits have all gone away,probably because both movies did well and made money for everyone involved. Yogi Bear  is a classic
kid's property ripe for revival but the weird mix of live action and the animated bears just looked off-putting from the get-go. Both have modest extras; I think everyone was just glad to get their payday and
move on.

<p>TERRIBLY HAPPY  ($29.98; Oscilloscope) -- This Danish film is a stylish bit of noir, handsomely
mounted and well-acted. If it's not entirely convincing, it's still a good genre piece that signals genuine
talent. Our hero is a cop banished from Copenhagen for personal reasons (he drew a gun on his wife in
anger) and stuck in a town terrorized by a bully who beats his wife and has father numerous bastard
children. The bully's wife pleads for help but rarely accepts it, have teasing our man with her desire and
frustrating his attempts to keep her safe. Is she really in danger? Crazy? Or just setting him up? The look
and feel of the film is what I admire most, even when the plot contrivances became too much. Above all,
it proves yet again that Beastie Boy Adam Yauch's Oscilloscope label has very good taste, always pickinginteresting films and packaging them nicely.

<p>for even hardcore fans of the genre or artist involved. The James Brown concert footage comes from a
show in 1979 when he did the first of many comebacks. It's poorly shot and has worse sound; most of thetime you're just staring at Brown's head while he sings. The Count and Duke are just glorifiedroundtables with artists that played with them, interspersed with old footage and (mostly) old stills. it'sfun to see these artists chat but their casual anecdotes and some stills do not a documentary film make.History Lesson  contains interviews and very poorly shot concert footage, covering bands like The Meat
Puppets, Red Kross, The Minutemen and Twisted Roots. Some major acts who deserve better.
STAND BY ME 25TH ANNIVERSARY  ($24.95; Sony) -- One of the best adaptations of a work by
Stephen King, director Rob Reiner's film still works thanks to great, great casting. River Phoenix, JerryO'Connell, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton and Kiefer Sutherland? Good job all around and they keep thesentimentality at bay. A BluRay exclusive is a video commentary with Reiner, Wheaton and Feldman.Surely this sort of option will supplant the audio commentary in years to come? It's just too much fun towatch them chat and interact.
SCARECROW AND MRS. KING SEASON TWO  ($39.98; Warner Bros.) -- Similr in tone and style
to Remington Steele (which debuted one year earlier), this light-hearted TV series showed the burgeoningromance between a housewife and a spy who found themselves traveling the globe on assignment. Sure itcould happen! Neither show can hold a candle to Moonlighting, but they're silly fun, thanks to thechemistry here of star Kate Jackson (the smart Angel) and Bruce Boxleitner, one of those actors thatconstantly makes you wonder, how come he never had a bigger career?</p>

ALIEN 2 ON EARTH  ($29.95 BluRay; Midnight Legacy) -- This Italian horror quickie was designed to
slipstream off the success of Ridley Scott's Alien and serve as a defacto sequel for those not paying close
attention. Though never released in the US, this tale of spelunkers facing horrible creatures under theearth's crust developed a cult following and here is decently restored. It's truly trashy rip-off basementtype horror stuff strictly for hardcore fans. You know who you are.

Couldn't resist one last shot at The Tourist and its stars could you? The movie is actually pretty
decent, better than most of the crap that is put out by Hollywood. And its $275m box office total fardiffers from its media characteri zation as a "flop".
That chase scene throught the canals of Venice was horrible! There was no suspense until the last10 minutes of the movie..Recency  |  Popularity

78 Fansthere was one good exchange in the tourist, the ravenous/r avishing quip, that was it till the guy at
the end said..... jk
Wold not even rent it tired of over done Jolie
Johnny Depp seemed to be sleepwalki ng through his role in The Tourist. Depp and Angelina Jolie
had no chemistry in the movie. It was a "thriller" that could put you to sleep.
Yes, my headline would have been "Do Not Operate Heavy Machinery While Watching 'The
Tourist'" but it didn't fit!
$28.95 for the DVD? Where are you shopping?? ??? I bought mine for $16.99 at Target. I saw this
movie in the theatre and liked it very much. We thought it was elegant and enjoyable. So did a lot ofother people I know who saw the movie. I mean...how seriously can you take a spy movie???Really. Lighten up.
I agree, it did just what it wa supposed to do, entertain. And did it very well, I might ad. Iwas not disappoint ed in the least, thought was an excellent movie.
Hi tega,
The prices I list are the suggested retail price from the studio. Naturally, you can always find
them on sale (especiall y when a DVD has just come out). Those prices vary wildly and
depend on where you shop. Glad you enjoyed The Tourist. I wasn't taking it seriously. Itwas intended to a light, stylish entertainm ent; I just didn't think it succeeded. But you're not
alone: my sister-in- law just told me I was wrong as well! Oh well, I'll have to suffer through
