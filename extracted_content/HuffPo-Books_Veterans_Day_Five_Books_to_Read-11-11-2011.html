<p>You can't go wrong with The Things They Carried , acclaimed as a modern masterpiece the day it was
released in 1990 and, if anything, it's reputation has only grown. The Tim O'Brien collection of short
stories is a favorite "handseller" of independent bookstores. That is, it's one of those books they will
always recommend to lovers of good fiction looking for a discovery. It's based on O'Brien's experience inthe Vietnam War.
That's also the source for the work of Karl Marlantes, who quietly set up shop on the bestseller list withthe novel Matterhorn  last year. Now he's returned with What It Is Like To Go To War , a nonfiction work
about his experience in war and how ill-prepared most 19-year-old kids are to endure it. It's alreadyappearing on lists of the best books of the year and is a fascinating companion piece to Matterhorn .MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

WATCH: 8 Sexiest MTV
Moments Of The 80s  
The Etymology Of Muppet</p>
<p>But today I want to talk art inspired by another war: the cartoons of Bill Mauldin. At one point, this man
who made the cover of Time  magazine twice was perhaps the most famous average soldier in the world
(as compared to generals like Patton and Eisenhower). Mauldin's Willie & Joe were grunts, regular footsoldiers who sat in the mud, complained about the food and otherwise captured the cynical, direct, let'sget this job done right so we don't have to do it again attitude that soldiers embodied during WW II.
First and foremost, Willie & Joe are funny. Fantagraphics has put the WW II years out in paperback, but
I've got the also available hardcover, a great looking slipcase in army green with two fat volumes of hiscaptivating artwork. Never having served (or even fired a gun), it's an absorbing glimpse into the day-to-
day life of soldiers while it was happening and the end not known. It's easy to identify with: employees in
any capacity gripe about their bosses. But the more specific Mauldin is, the more biting and fascinatinghis work is. The strip was a remarkable outlet for frustrations and annoyance and genuine anger: it didn't
just poke fun at the higher-ups; it revealed problems and gripes that needed to be addressed. Seeing
Willie & Joe endure the same craziness was surely comforting. But this wasn't just an easy way to redirectattention from the actual problems they faced. And while the war was on, people at home took just asmuch comfort in their sad sack endurance. It was wildly popular among civilians as well as soldiers;
being able to joke about the hardships meant they'd be okay in the end, right?
Finally, it's Willie & Joe: Back Home  that moved me the most. The cover shows a soldier without a place
to stay, sleeping on a park bench and covered in a poster saying "Welcome Home" to the soldiers. Too
often, soldiers are praised and appreciated in the heat of battle but treated like an annoyance once thefighting has stopped. Bill Mauldin wasn't even sure anyone would want to hear about Willie & Joe onceWorld War II had been won and, indeed, the strip faded in popularity, especially as Mauldin tackled
social issues and kept a spotlight on the poor treatment of soldiers, who deserved better.
Clearly, veterans don't get two votes at the ballot box despite their service and the risking of life and limb
when called to duty. But sometimes even that one vote, that one voice is begrudged, whether it's theveteran in Oakland sent to the hospital by cops during an apparently peaceful protest in the Occupymovement or a soldier getting booed during a Presidential debate because he identified himself as gay
and said he wanted to serve his country without having to lie.
it's all happened before. Todd DePastino's excellent essay details Mauldin's career, his artistic
achievements and the battles he fought within himself and with his syndicators over this series. Mauldin
is always funny, but those with a rosy image of WW II will be surprised by the complex world shownhere: sometimes veterans are chagrined to discover that jobs they were assured would be waiting for
them have disappeared while other times they're disconcerted to see the person who is going to be fired
to make way for them. Again and again, veterans are forgotten, forced to travel home by riding the railsor wondering where the crowds are that greeted vets after the victory in Europe but have moved on bythe time the Pacific boys head home.HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3

<p>This was bad enough as far as some newspapers were concerned, but Mauldin really lost them when he
continually focused on social issues. Mauldin skewered the prejudice that treated a returning vet as a Japbecause of how he looked, never mind where he was born or where he fought. He mocked the VFW, at
the time held hostage according to Mauldin by the soldiers of a different era who blocked moves to give
WW II vets real say in the organization and then publicly supported hateful agendas like segregation that
had nothing to do with the group as such. Mauldin could tease young college students fired up by social
consciousness but turn around and be blistering over the vicious prejudice and hatred of lynching.
People turned away. Where were the easy laughs of Willie & Joe? Papers dropped him, even as Mauldin
found the right voice to balance his heart with his humor. By December 31, 1946 it was all over. Willie &
Joe were home but forgotten. Mauldin had just won the Pulitzer Prize one year earlier but no one wanted
to hear him now. In the 1950s he would focus on editorial cartooning with great success. And Willie &
Joe were still beloved by the greatest generation, given tribute by Charles Schulz in his Peanuts strip on
Veterans Day in 1998. Willie & Joe and Mauldin made it onto a stamp in 2010, seven years after he died.
And now Fantagraphics has captured Mauldin's most enduring characters in two releases that do him
justice.
If Veterans Day proves the spur to dive into any of these books (or the many others I might have
mentioned), then that's just one more reason to say thanks to the people who have served in the past and
do so today.
