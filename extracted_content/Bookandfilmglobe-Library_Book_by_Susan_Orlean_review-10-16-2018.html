Check Out ‘The Library Book’
Susan Orlean’s Long-Overdue Celebration Of The Public Library
 October 16, 2018  Michael Giltz
Author Susan Orlean has enjoyed extraordinary critical and popular success with books like The Orchid Thief
and Rin Tin Tin , her biography of Hollywood’s four-legged star. Heck, Meryl Streep even played her in a
movie ! And yet, she was done with writing. Orlean simply didn’t have interest in devoting years and years of
her life just to produce one more book.
Then she went to the library. Moving to Los Angeles andtaking her son for his first visit to their new branchbrought on a Proustian rush of memory. Orlean wasoverwhelmed by images from her own childhood whenshe and her mom shared visits to the library as a belovedritual. The L.A. library was new to her but it immediatelyfelt like home.
That prompted Orlean to take a private guided tour (the</p>
<p>Not actually Susan Orleanprivileges of fame) and that led to her becoming more and
more excited by this almost invisible institution we take
for granted. In fact, legendary documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman  has been focusing on institutions in
America like hospitals and schools and zoos for 50 years. Even he only got around to the library in 2017.
Then Orlean’s guide mentioned the fire. Fire, what fire? THE fire, he responded. On April 29, 1986 the Los
Angeles Central Library went up in flames. It damaged or destroyed more than one million books and provedthe worst library fire in US history. It was ruled as arson but no one was ever found guilty. The reason Orlean–and perhaps most people outside Los Angeles–have never heard of the fire? Well, it happened the same week asthe Chernobyl nuclear meltdown. The end of a library vs. the end of the world? Well, the media focused on theend of the world.
Now Orlean has focused on the fire…and so much more. The Library Book  does about two dozen things, all of
them well. It covers the fire and its aftermath in fascinating detail, including the gay would-be actor who
claimed to be the arsonist but proved such an inveterate liar he would drive friends and enemies alike to drink.It tells the history of the L.A. library system, including sketches of early head librarians from redoubtablewomen like Telsa Kesslo (who dared to go outdoors without a hat; scandalous!) to the colorful, unqualified butgenerally significant Charles Lummis, who made national news by walking from Ohio to L.A. in 1885.
The list goes on: How libraries work, the purpose of libraries, their changing role from a warehouse of books to
a community center and source of information and services, the history of women as librarians, the latest onarson investigations, the life of that actor Harry Peak, all of it juggled masterfully in an unfolding narrative thatnever flags. It’s the sort of book for which you’ll gladly pay an overdue fine.
