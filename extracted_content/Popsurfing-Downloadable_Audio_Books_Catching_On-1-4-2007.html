            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 4 ,  2 0 0 7Downloadable Audio Books Catching OnNot with the public, which has always liked them. But with publishers,who suddenly realize that there are some 70 million iPods out thereand that people might actually want to listen to books on them.Downloadable titles are cheaper than buying the audio books on CD, ofcourse. It's a growing niche market, but I think publishers are fools. Inan era of flat and declining book sales, they ned to offer better value forthe money, not try and squeeze out more bucks by making people paytwice or three times for the pleasure of reading a book on an electronicreader or listening to it on an iPod. Do people pay to watch a DVD onTV and then have to pay again to watch it on a portable laptop and payagain to watch it in their car? Of course not. Publishers should sellbooks FOR THE SAME PRICE they're available today and offer thosebuyers FREE access to that same book as an eBook and as adownloadable audio file for their iPods or to hear on their computers.Imagine, more value for the same money. It'll never happen.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
