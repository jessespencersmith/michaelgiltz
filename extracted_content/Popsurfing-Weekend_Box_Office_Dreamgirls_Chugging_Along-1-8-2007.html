            <p>M O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 8 ,  2 0 0 7Weekend Box Office: "Dreamgirls" ChuggingAlongEvey week seems like a hurdle for "Dreamgirls." It opened on aMonday, showed weak sales during weekdays and stayed on a limitednumber of screens. But through it all, it's already grossed $54.5 million,with an expansion and Oscar nominations as likely boosters in the nextfew weeks. It's going to go from 852 screens to 1800 screens this Fridayand I kind of wish it wouldn't. Like "Borat," this film has proven thatsuper-wide releases are not always a good thing. Repeated breakdownsshow that 90% of the grosses come from 1200 screens, with the rest ofthe box office trickling in from the other 1000-2000 screens. And thatdoesn't take into account the fun factor. It's a lot more fun to see"Borat" or "Dreamgirls" (or most movies) when the theater is fairly full.The audience reaction to comedy or big musical numbers is contagious.Personally, I would have expanded a little more modestly to 1200screens to make sure most cities had a chance to see it and then waitedfor the Oscar nominations. But it's another chance for "Dreamgirls" toprove the naysayers wrong. Meanwhile, "Eragon" has done smashingbusiness overseas, grossing more than double its US take for a total of$200 million worldwide and still going strong. A sequel now seemslikely. And sometime this week "Casino Royale" will become thetop-grossing Bond film ever in the US. The Top 10, per Box OfficeProphets:1. Night At The Museum -- $24 million ($164.1 million total)2. The Pursuit Of Happyness -- $13 million ($124.2 million)3. Children Of Men -- $10.3 million ($11.9 million)4. Freedom Writers -- $9.7 million5. Dreamgirls -- $8.8 million ($54.5 million total)6. Happily N'Ever After -- $6.8 million7. Charlotte's Web -- $6.6 million ($67 million)8. The Good Shepherd -- $6.5 million ($48.4 million)9. Rocky Balboa -- $6.3 million ($60.9 million)10. We Are Marshall -- $5.1 million ($35.4 million)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 10:59 AM
