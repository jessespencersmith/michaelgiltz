What We SayAuthor E.K. Johnston must have feasted on sand when writing her debut novel: it feels completely at home in thedesert. Ideas and imagery, the metaphors and stories characters employ, the world they inhabit is all clearly andconvincingly rooted in an Arabian world of long ago. While Johnston's book uses elements from the tale ofScheherazade, it is not a "reboot" or retelling. You soon forget the source it drew upon. A young woman lives in aland where a cruel king takes a new bride and after a day or a week or at most a month, kills her and takes a newone from another village. Since times are good and the kind otherwise rules well, men go along. Not our heroine.Everyone knows her sister will be chosen when their time comes but instead she arranges to be taken instead. Backat the palace with the king, what should be a terrifying night becomes an odd battle of wills. The new queen doesn'tpacify him with a series of tales ending in a cliffhanger a la the Scheherezade of our youth. The simple fact that shedoesn't appear afraid of him intrigues the man. Magic is present in this telling and slowly the battle for her lifebecomes a battle for the king's soul once she suspects a demon has taken hold. The novel tells the tale from boththe perspective of our heroine and in certain passages the demon that occupies the king's body. In a bold gambit,most of the characters are unnamed; our heroine is just that, and her sister is called her sister and her father is calledher father. These people often come alive as individuals but the lack of naming gives the story a fable-like quality thatmakes the magic seem perfectly natural. It climaxes smartly and satisfyingly if rather neatly. "A Thousand Nights"doesn't quite hit greatness but it's solid in ways that bode well. One has the sense Johnston is just stretching hermuscles here. We're not left with a cliffhanger, but nonetheless she impatiently leaves the reader wanting more. --Michael GoltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
