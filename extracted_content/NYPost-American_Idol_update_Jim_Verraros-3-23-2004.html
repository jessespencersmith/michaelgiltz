            <p>Life after 'Idol' 
sounds sweet 
By MICHAEL GLITZ 
Is there life after" American 
Idol"? 
You bet --~ nd you don't 
even have to be one of the 
show's winners to win hig in the 
music biz. Some of the show's 
runncrs ~up are far~ng almost' as 
weli in their performing Careers 
as the show's high-profile win­
ners. 
Just check out Kimberly 
Locke, who came in third in sea­
son two. She'll be bad nn 
Wednesday night's "AI" (8:30 
on Fox/Ch. 5) to perform her 
first single, "8th World Won­
der," 
Of course, the three best­
known "Idol" ah.llnni -winners 
Relly Clarkson (c,cason one), 
Ruben Studdard (season two) 
and (-::lav Aiken (season two's 
first Huiner-up) --continue to 
dominat e the charts. 
Even contestimis who 
wero forced OIlit of "AI" 
~o •• like <J! sure thilll!g tft 
l'ol.rtiu-hulI1 gry 
producers.

And tlwt':; jU(;t ll1<'! tip Gfthe

S011 alumnu: " R f. Helton is I e­
leasing his first ;:llbum, "l{e~1 
Life," on the Christian music 
label Gospocentric. 
Military roan Josh Graciu, 
whose cuuntry-fla vored vocals 
earned him a fourth-plilce finish 
in" AI's" second s~as(Jn. h;}~; a 
fast-risin g sin~~1c on the cuuntry 
charts c<1I1cd "J \,Vi:mt To Li'.re," 
It's ali e<'1liy at No Ll5 arter a 
merE' three wed::s. But even contestants who 
were forced out of "AI" look 
like a sure thing to youth-hun ­
gry pn ,ducers. 
Frenchie Davis, who had I'll 
leave the show during its first 
season after topless photos of 
her surfaced on the lvternet, 
had a run on Broadway in 
"Rent," and is currently touring 
as the lead in the musical 
"Dreamgiris ," which is expected 
to return to Broadway this year. 
WilHam Hung, this season's 
so-bacl-he ',-good contestant, 
just signed an inexplicable deal 
with Koch Records; his CD is 
cine out April 6. 
Bushy-haired Justin Guarini 
seems like tbe only graduale of 
"American Idol" who can't get a 
break. His debut "Ibum flopped 
and he lias been dropped hy his 
labe1. 
And.though 'r"ll1yr;, c,r;;y had 
a recun ing role in the flmll sea­
!-ion pfthe Fox sel i~s "Boston 
Public," she has also been 
dropPf'li hy her labd -without 
releasi.ng [! single. 
But mnst "American Idol" 
cu:mestanls h~vc turned what 
should have been J. men: 15 min­
utes of fame into real Cilrt:CI s. 
Even hm Yen arns, the singer

April and has rt lead role iu the 
indie lilrn "Eating Out," which 
debuts ilt the London Gay and 
Lesbian Film Festival Anrill. 
Verr~lf(1S says it's~, relief to 
"jnst be able to step out of that 
'American. idol' bubble and per· 
form the way I want to." 
Verrarm :; hopes to sigri ~l re­
