3/14/2005 03:27:00 PMVanity Fair has a terrific, lengthy expose about Halliburton andhow it made billions in Iraq, mostly on no-compete contracts.This feature details their laziness and corruption and greed,and profiles the brave whistleblowers who risked their careers(and soometimes their lives) to stand up to it.Some highlights: how standard operating procedure wasignored time and again (awarding contracts rarely followed therules), how incompetence was the order of the day (truckdrivers in Iraq begged for regular maintenance and tried toexplain to idiotic superiors that they were transporting goods ina stupid dangerous fashion), how wastefulness was a way oflife (trainees were put up in luxury hotels back in Americawhen Motel 6 would have been more appropriate) and whynothing will be done about it (the Republicans control bothHouses). Engrossing.
