10/28/2004 11:41:00 AMFalluja is far from the only trouble spot in Iraq. Now it's clear that thecity of Ramadi is descending into chaos. And guess what? It's largerand more strategically important than Falluja, which Bush refused toquell by sending in troops months ago because he was afraid it wouldhurt his reelection chances. Nice, putting your own personal needsahead of the safety of our troops and the vital mission in Iraq."Most of the military's resources are channeled into controlling abomb-infested, four-and-a-half-mile stretch of road that runs throughdowntown and connects two bases. Insurgents pop out of alleyways,mosques and a crowded market and fire at marines at will, thendisappear when the Americans give chase," says the NYT."Ramadi lies at the heart of rebellious Anbar Province and astride themajor western supply route to Baghdad. The city, whose 400,000residents have at best merely tolerated the foreign military presence,is seen as a crucial part of American efforts to plant a seculardemocracy in Iraq."But the disintegration of authority puts in jeopardy both the Bushadministration's plan to stage nationwide elections by Jan. 31 andany sense of legitimacy such elections might have. It also complicatesthe American military's plans to invade Falluja, because of the closecoordination between insurgents in the two cities."
