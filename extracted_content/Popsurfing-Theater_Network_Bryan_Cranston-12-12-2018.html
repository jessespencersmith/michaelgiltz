THEATER: "Network" Has A Star, But No Show
NETWORK  * 1/2 out of ****
BELASCO  THEATRE  
Mediocre talents fail in dull, uninteresting ways. They mount a play,
you shrug and forget it the next day. Bold, visionary talents fail in
spectacular fashion. What were they thinking, you wonder, jaw agape?But at least you know they were thinking, striving, doing something  or
at least trying  to do something. Director Ivo van Hove and his team of
collaborators fail in marvelous fashion with this stage adaptation of
Paddy Chayevsky's all too prescient film Network .
That movie was a scathing cry from the heart about the
commercialization of journalism. A once-sacred area of television was
becoming a profit center. Instead of providing a public good,
corporations realized they could provide product in the guise of newsand make money. A lot of it. Chayevsky saw it happening and createda wicked satire that showed news anchors expressing opinions on air!The more shocking their opinions the higher the ratings. It was
absurd, over the top, ridiculous...and now seems quaint in comparison
to what TV news has actually become.
At least with the terrific Bryan Cranston present, you're never in
confusion as to why  they tackled it in the first place. His supporting
character -- newscaster turned prophet Howard Beale -- is fatallyturned into the star of the show. It's like watching a second banana ina sitcom get their own spin-off; that rarely works and it certainlydoesn't here.
For one thing, the adaptation by Lee Hall doesn't give Beale a bigger
story or any sort of arc. In the film, he has a mental breakdown andthose on-air rants he delivers ("I'm mad as hell and I'm not going totake it anymore!") are terrific thunderbolts. They break up the mainMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>story, which is really about an aging newsman cheating on both his
wife and his journalistic conscience. (In the film, that character of Max
Schumacher is played by William Holden; here it's Tony Goldwyn.)Beale doesn't change or grow -- he has a breakdown and that's aboutit.
Unfortunately, the same is true in this play. Beale has a breakdown
early on...and that's about it. But this time around he dominates theaction; in fact, whenever we interrupt his mania for a peek intoSchumacher's disintegrating marriage it's kind of a jolt. Oh yeah, that's
happening too. And Beale's rants grow increasingly predictable in
every way. Playwright Hall jazzes up Beale's show a la the film with anelaborate new presentation. He's given a late night talk show sort ofintro (rather than the sober air appropriate to a newsman) and an
announcer and crew member urging applause give an elaborate spiel
asking us to repeat Beale's catchphrase and then applaud loudly.That's fine once; it's even ok twice. But when they do it again andagain and again it goes beyond making some sort of point and justfeels lazy. They've made Beale the star of the show but they realize he
has nothing to offer. If they're driving home the emptiness of the
spectacle, well we got it the first time.
Cranston does what he can with the part. A skilled TV actor (as well asa Tony winning veteran of the stage), the part is in some ways perfectfor him (if only it were better). He plays to the camera beautifully and
if you feel drawn to watch him on one of the many video screens
adorning the stage, well that makes perfect sense. After all, the TV iswhere Beale comes alive and that's rightly where Cranston pitches hisperformance.
Fans of the film may be aghast at how tepid the heart of the movie
comes across here. Goldwyn and Tatiana Maslany of Orphan  Blackcan do nothing with their doomed romance. And the corporate politicson display barely make an impression as the cameras whirl backThe Movies, Books, Theater,

<p>around to another spiel from Howard Beale. They are sideshow to the
prophet and he is sideshow to the real star of the show and the real
tragedy: the directorial vision of van Hove and his team.
For years now, van Hove and a   crack team of production talent have
dominated theater and opera. Here it's Jan Versweyveld (scenic and
lighting design), Tal Yarden (video design), An D'huys (costumedesign) and Eric Sleichim (music and sound). No matter what Van
Hove tackles, it's sure to have a bold vision, a striking conceit that
dominates his take on a classic of stage or screen. You may not alwaysagree with his take on a piece (my personal favorite is his View  FromThe  Bridge  as boxing match) but by God you had to deal with it.
Here they have come a cropper. As one might expect, this productionof Network  includes lots of tv cameras, lots of video screens and a
stage that usually includes an announcer's desk front and center with astudio booth on stage right. What one doesn't expect is that stage rightis dominated by...a bar facing the wall? With a few scattered tables
and audience members who eat a meal while watching the show? And
a couch from Schumacher's home? Now, the handful of audiencemembers sitting on stage -- almost as if by accident -- aren't a studioaudience. That would have made sense, I guess. Nor are they people ina bar or restaurant who might be coached into becoming glued to TVsplaying in the bar when Beale goes on a rant. No, they're just sitting
on stage, watching the show and eating dinner brought out by wait
staff during set changes while we watch them and wonder what theheck they're doing up there.
The bar is used in maybe one and a half scenes, including a very early
one where Cranston and Goldwyn sidle up to the bar for a heart toheart and stand in a far, far corner with their backs to the audience(though of course we can watch them on camera). Other than a sex
scene that took place either in the bar or somewhere else (I wasn't
quite sure), I can't for the life of me imagine why they had the baronstage in the first place. Making matters worse, the studio booth is sonarrow and cluttered (and so poorly covered by the cameras), thatvirtually nothing that happens in it is dramatically interesting or even
visible, except for one brief line by Maslany late in the show. It's
literally a jumbled mess that's ignored 90% of the time and a deeplyawkward set when van Hove does try and stage some action there.
In short, one third of the stage is taken up by a jumbled studio booth
that's hard to see into, the other side of the stage is taken up by an
unnecessary bar and theater goers are seated in the midst of this,
chowing down on food and drinking wine. If that's not enough,multiple scenes are staged out of sight entirely. You can (almost)always see the actors on a video screen but you also waste a lot of time
peering around the set, wondering where in fact the actors who are
talking to one another might actually be. One scene is actually set infront of the theater for no good reason, though it was nice to see NewYorkers know enough to not look at a camera and just keep walking,</p>
<p>even if Tony Goldwyn and Tatiana Maslany are making out in front of
them.
It's so...ugly, such a godawful mess, so unsatisfying and cluttered and
so very, very different in every way from what van Hove and his team
have done so many times before that it's hard to believe this wasstaged in London, they saw it...and then kept it intact for New York.What were they thinking? I haven't a clue but undoubtedly they werethinking of something and Cranston's magnetic if wasted turn as Beale
let them think they were onto it.
As a final head-scratcher, the show ends, the cast takes its bow, the
lights come up...and as the audience gathers its things, the video
monitors begin to show news footage of Gerald Ford being sworn in as
President of the United States. Huh? Maybe it's a testament to thepower of TV or maybe the audience was just intrigued enough by thesheer randomness of this, but most everyone stayed put. Ford wasfollowed by Jimmy Carter being sworn in and he was followed by
Ronald Reagan. Well, it's clear where this is headed and you get no
points for predicting like I did how the audience would react. GeorgeBush Sr. got some polite applause (since he'd just died) while BillClinton received notably modest clapping himself. (His stock has fallenhard in recent years.) George W. Bush was mostly ignored, BarackObama of course received thunderous applause and Donald Trump
even louder boos. (Except for one yahoo in the orchestra who
applauded. Tourists!)
It was admittedly a fascinating bit of tracking the popularity of recent
US Presidents. But surely if they wanted to make some point
connected with the show we just saw, they should have shown footage
of Geraldo Rivera and Jerry Springer and Glenn Beck breaking downin tears on air a la Howard Beale and Rush Limbaugh and Lou Dobbsand Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly and Sean Hannity today. Sure, theycould have ended with Trump though that seems too obvious to
bother. Presidential swearing-in footage? It's just one more missing
piece of the puzzle that is this messy, confused, mixed message of ashow from one of the most noteworthy talents in theater. Like Beale,van Hove might fall on his face sometimes, but he's never boring.
