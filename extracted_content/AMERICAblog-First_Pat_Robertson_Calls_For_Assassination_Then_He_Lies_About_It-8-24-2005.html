8/24/2005 02:21:00 PMPat Robertson has lost his mind. Again. Everyone in the worldsaw the clip of Robertson calling for the assassination of ademocratically elected leader of Venezuela. Some White Houseofficials mildly distanced themselves from it (though Bush saidnothing and groups like Focus on the Family stayed mum). NowRobertson is lying and even Fox News is calling him on it."I didn't say 'assassination,'" clarified Robertson duringa broadcast of his "The 700 Club" Wednesday morning. "Isaid our special forces should go 'take him out,' and 'takehim out' could be a number of things, includingkidnapping."He blamed The Associated Press for making him seem toadvocate the assassination of a foreign leader."There are a number of ways to take out a dictator frompower besides killing him," Robertson said. "I wasmisinterpreted by the AP, but that happens all the time."However, during the original "700 Club" broadcastMonday night, Robertson clearly mentionedassassination."You know, I don't know about this doctrine ofassassination, but if he thinks we are trying toassassinate him, we should go ahead and do it,"Robertson said Monday.Pat Robertson: unholy, sinful and a big fat liar.
