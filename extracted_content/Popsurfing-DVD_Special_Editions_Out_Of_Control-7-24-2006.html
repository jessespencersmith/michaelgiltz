            <p>M O N D AY,  J U LY  2 4 ,  2 0 0 6DVD Special Editions Out Of ControlSony announced today that "Bugsy: Extended Cut" will come out onOctober 3rd. Wonderful, but for one thing: whose extended cut? Theydon't mention Warren Beatty or director Barry Levinson or evenscreenwriter James Toback. Surely with Beatty backing him, Levinsonhad control over the final cut for this Oscar-winning film. Studios arechurning out 'special edition" cuts of movies left and right, assumingpeople will just buy anything. The great thing about DVD is they don'tHAVE to make us choose. It's very easy to include a theatrical releaseAND a director's cut (if there is such a thing) on one DVD or in a set.Odds and ends -- deleted scenes that the director didn't use and neverintended to use -- shouldn't be slapped into the movie wily-nily.Include them in the extras as deleted scenes, for heaven's sake. I'll betwhen they release this, the original theatrical version goes out of printand that's a travesty. The theatrical versions should ALWAYS be theprimary version available on DVD except in a very few rare instancesany film buff can name. (And the original version should still beavailable anyway.) Nowadays, finding the theatrical version isbecoming harder and harder.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Priv8pete is referring to a screening of a three hour rough cut of "TheFour Feathers" that he attended. The final theatrical version he foundfar less satisfying. I have no objection to a "director's cut" of The FourFeathers -- assuming Kapur WANTS a director's cut out there andNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
