10/14/2004 04:34:00 AMI've just spent ten minutes going to all the online polls -- the links arebelow. And as of 4:30 am (EST), Kerry is trouncing Bush. Of course,these polls aren't at all scientific. But they do demonstrate which sidehas a more pro-active, energized base. And unlike the national polls,Kerry's numbers are way over Bush. Heck, he's even beating Bush by11 points on the FOX poll! Keep voting early and often -- just like inFlorida.
