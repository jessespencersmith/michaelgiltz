9/02/2005 12:49:00 AMDan Froomkin of The Washington Post reported on Wednesdaythat Dick Cheney has spent part of August at his home outsideJackson Wyoming. A Cheney spokesperson insisted it wasn't avacation because he'd had some briefings.As of Wednesday -- two days after Hurricane Katrinadevastated the Gulf States -- Cheney was STILL VACATIONINGIN JACKSON WYOMING. And when was Cheney headed back toWashington?"He will certainly be coming back. I'm not able to tell youthe day right now. I don't have that handy."Can you believe it? (Kudos to reader Aaron for pointing us to this.)For days AFTER the worst natural disaster in our nation's history:Bush stayed on vacation. On Monday he went to Arizona to cut abirthday cake with John McCain and play politics on Medicare. OnTuesday -- as the flood waters were rising and the death toll mounted-- Bush played politics again, heading out to California to make aspeech offering another excuse for staying the course in Iraq (oil!)and jamming on a guitar. He knew he had to end his vacation early(sigh) but couldn't bring himself to head straight to Washington DC.So Bush went BACK to Crawford for one more cozy night of restbefore finally heading back to Washington DC on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Condi Rice is in the midst of a THREE DAY vacation thatbegan AFTER the hurricane struck New Orleans. She's gone to aBroadway show, played tennis with Monica Seles and reportedlybought really expensive Ferragamo shoes.And DICK CHENEY HAS BEEN HANGING OUT IN JACKSON, WYOMINGALL THIS TIME!!!!Every damn reporter in this country better insist on asking again andagain and again exactly what Cheney and Rice have been doing theselast few days and why the HELL THEY WEREN'T BACK INWASHINGTON DC DEALING WITH THE WORST DISASTER IN OURNATION'S HISTORY.If this doesn't wake people up to their utter callousness, stupidity andcontempt for average Americans -- especially at a time of the mostdire crisis -- well, then nothing will.Bush is relaxing in Crawford, Condi is going to a Broadway show andDick Cheney is probably fly fishing -- all AFTER the hurricane struck.WHERE IS DICK? WHEN DID HE GET BACK TO DC? WHY WASN'T HEBACK THERE ON MONDAY? OR TUESDAY? OR WEDNESDAY?
