Pennies From Heaven **** Warner Bros., $59.98 
In this brilliant 1978 British 
miniseries, a youthful Bob 
Hoskins plays a Depression-era 
traveling sheet-music salesman 
with a frigid wife and dreams 
of happier days. The ground­
breaking script by Dennis 
Potter ("The Singing 
Detective") lets characters 
break out into song by lip­
syncing to period tunes and 
then cruelly yanks them back to 
reality. Steve Martin starred in a 
remarkably faithful adaptation 
for the movies only three years 
later (Warner Bros., $19.97) that 
freaked out fans of "The Jerk." 
Combat! Season 1 
campaign 1 
***'/, Image, $39.99 
Everything Tom Hanks 
accomplished with the WW II 
miniseries "Band of Brothers" 
-vivid realism, great actors, 
and spot-on dialogue -was 
done just as well 40 years 
earlier with 1962's "Combat!," a 
TV series that follows a group 
of GI's (Vic Morrow, Shecky 
Greene) as they fight their way 
across Europe. Use of.genuine 
war footage isn't just a money­
saver; it's a sober reminder that 
real people made these 
sacrifices. Along with 16 
episodes, extras include a new 
documentary and audio Showgirls 
V.I.P. 
Edition 
**** MGM, $39 • .:..:98=----_ 
Director Paul 
Verhoeven, writer 
Joe Eszterhas and 
star Elizabeth 
Berkley all 
dedicated 
themselves heart and 
soul to this 1995 drama 
about a stripper who 
dreams of becoming a 
Vegas showgirl. Only 
complete earnestness 
could have created such 
hilarious camp. Now comes 
a party version, including shot 
glasses, a "pin the pasties on the 
showgirl" game and 
commentary by strippers. 
commentary by guest directors 
such as Robert Altman. 
La Ceremonie ** HVE,$29.95 
French director Claude 
Chabrol has gained in stature 
over the years. But, in truth, 
he's not "the French 
Hitchcock." He's just second­
rate Hitchcock. This silly 1995 
thriller is typically hard to 
swallow. Isabelle Huppert stars 
as a servant who seduces the 
illiterate Sophie (Sandrine 
Bonnaire) into turning on their 
employer. 
You Bet Your Life: 
The Best Episodes 
*** Shout, $39.98 
Groucho Marx 
enjoyed a 14-
year run on 
radio and TV 
with this silly 
game show 
that served as 
an excuse for 
his gently 
mocking humor. Eighteen 
episodes are here, featuring 
guest stars like Johnny 
Weismuller, Edgar Bergen and 
a young Candice Bergen. 
Terrific extras include a "Stag 
Reel" (racy bits edited out), 
original commercials and three 
. Groucho pilots for other game 
shows.</p>
