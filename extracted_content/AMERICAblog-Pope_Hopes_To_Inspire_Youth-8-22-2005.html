8/22/2005 04:55:00 PMWorld Youth Day is over and Pope Benedict is clearly no popstar a la John Paul II, but he was still able to attract massivecrowds (and fringe cult Opus Dei was especially prominent,according to the LA Times). The Church likes to pretend JPIIreally lit a fire among young people, but that just isn't true.JPII oversaw a dramatic DECLINE in young people feeling calledto enter religious orders. In other words, no new priests. JPIIwas simply a disaster for inspiring growth in the West becausethe Church lied and misled its flock, abused boys, andincreasingly insisted to be a good Catholic you had to closeyour mind to common sense. Pope Benedict isn't going tochange that at all and the Church is going to continue to suffer.
