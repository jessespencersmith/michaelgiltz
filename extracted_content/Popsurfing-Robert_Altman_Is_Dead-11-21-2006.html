            <p>T U E S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 1 ,  2 0 0 6Robert Altman Is DeadRobert Altman died today at 81. But as far as Hollywood wasconcerned, he was also dead back in 1980 after his ill-fated "Popeye"flopped. Suddenly, one of the most famous directors around simplycouldn't get any of his films made. Altman retreated to a series of verylow-budget films -- many of them adapted from plays -- that weredecidedly un-Altmanesque. No overlapping dialogue, no huge cast ofcharacters, no interlocking storylines. "Streamers" tackled gays in themilitary, "Come Back To The Five and Dime, Jimmy dean, JimmyDean" gave respect to Cher, "Secret Honor" was a riveting one-manshow about Nixon that gave Philip Baker Hall the role of a lifetime,"Tanner '88" (a collaboration with "Doonesbury's" Garry Trudeau) wasground-breaking and all too prescient), and "Vincent & Theo" provedhe could reach out again to a wider audience. Those films would be anice career for most people; for Altman, they are practically a footnote.But they also hit theaters when I was in high school and college so theywere my first introduction to him. It's sort of like coming through thesidedoor -- like falling for Springsteen via "Nebraska" -- but I wouldn'thave it any other way. Obviously, you should watch "Nashville,""McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and many others. Personally, I didn't feel"Short Cuts" captured what I loved about writer Raymond Carver and"The Player" seemed a bit toothless. For me, Altman's late careermasterpiece is "Gosford Park," a gem set on a British estate that getsbetter every time I see it. When he lost Best Director and Best Pictureto Ron Howard and "A Beautiful Mind," I knew Hollywood was nevergoing to give him an out-and-out win. "Gosford Park" was anAnglophile's dream, bursting with brilliant performances, a solid hitand very funny with a shattering finale. What more could he do? (Iwouldn't have minded if he lost to Peter Jackson and "The Lord of theRings: Fellowship of the Ring.") So thank goodness Hollywood gavehim an honorary Oscar last year. It turned out to be just in time. R.I.P.and I hope there's pot in heaven or he's gonna be angry.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 12:32 PM
