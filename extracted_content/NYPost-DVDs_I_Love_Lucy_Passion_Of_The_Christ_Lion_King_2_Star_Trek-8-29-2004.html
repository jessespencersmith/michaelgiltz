TheCOmp ete 
second season **** Paramount, $69.99 
ANOTHER classic 
series finally given 
the deluxe 
treatment. Season 
One is foolishly 
available in a string 
of individual DVDs. 
Season Two is a 
well packaged 
boxed set with loads 
of extras including 
Lucille Ball's radio 
show and hilarious 
flubs. Among the 
episodes: the 
endlessly funny 
chocolate-factory 
follies. 
The Passion of 
the Christ 
* Fox, $29.98 
SOMETHING is sadly wrong 
when a movie about Jesus -
even one focusing on only a 
tiny sliver of His life -leaves 
viewers reeling from blood and 
torture and pain and ugliness 
instead of love or compassion 
or hope. No extras, 
unfortunately, so no chance to 
hear Mel Gibson explain the 
many deviations from 
scripture, the historical 
inaccuracies, or other 
controversies. Heathens will 
prefer the three vulgar, crass, 
but funny South Park episodes 
on "The Passion Of The Jew" 
(Paramount, $19.99). 
The Lion King 2: 
Simba's Pride **1/2 
Disney, $29.99 
DISNEY churns out way too 
many straight-to-DVD titles 
from their popular hits. But 
"Simba's Pride" is better than 
most. Simba's daughter Kiara 
unwittingly falls for Kovu, a 
cub from a rival pride. The 
animation is pretty good and 
the songs are great, including 
"He Lives In You" and "My 
Lullaby," the latter composed 
by "Buffy" creator Joss 
Whedon. Lots of fun games and 
short extras for kids. Families 
should also snatch up "Rocky & 
Bullwinkle & Friends: The 
Complete Second Season" (Classic Media, $39.98), the 
kiddie show with lots of inside 
jokes for adults. 
Gettysburg and 
Stories of Valor **1/2 
Inecom, $39.95 
PITY any filmmaker with a 
love of the Civil War: 
Everything on the subject 
stands in the shadow of Ken 
Burns' brilliant series. This 
two-volume set by director 
Mark Bussler is no exception, 
but hardcore buffs will soak up 
the narration by Keith 
Carra dine and minutiae about 
medicine, prisons, battle plans 
and much, much more. 
Star Trek The Original 
Series: The Complete 
First Season 
**** Paramount, $129.99 
FINALLY! 
"Star 
Trek" has 
been 
available 
only in 
expensive 
single­
volume 
DVDs­
it took 40 
discs and an acre of shelf space 
to hold them. Now Paramount 
has delivered a nifty packaging 
of the entire first season with 
hours of the usual extras 
(though oddly not the original 
pilot, "The Cage"). Beam it up.</p>
