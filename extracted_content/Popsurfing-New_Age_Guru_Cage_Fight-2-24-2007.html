            <p>S AT U R D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 4 ,  2 0 0 7New-Age Guru Cage FightThe #1 book on the nonfiction list this week is "The Secret," a self-helpbook that puts a New Age spin on the power of positive thinking(offered up by Norman Vincent Peale in the 50s), which was itself arehashing of "Secrets of the Ages" from the 20s which ITSELF camefrom books like "Master Key System," "The Science of Getting Rich,"Christian Science and -- later -- my favorite title, "Thoughts AreThings."Anyway, there's a book and a DVD, all devoted to The Law OfAttraction, which says basically that if you really, really want somethingand can devotedly yearn for it, you'll get it. (I guess I don't really want adate that much.) Oprah has devoted two shows to it. There's abest-selling DVD. And there's a feud.Esther Hicks has been making millions over the past two decadespushing her book "The Law Of Attraction" and channeling spirit voicesfrom beyond that she collectively calls Abraham. Though she wasfeatured prominently in an early version of the DVD and got more than$500,000 in royalties, Hicks was genuinely unhappy the movie didn'texplain that she made the discovery of the Secret by "vibrationallyaccessing broader intelligence."My favorite detail: Rhonda Byrne of "The Secret" (who often has asilver circle affixed to her forehead) had a falling out with Esther Hicksof "The Law Of Attraction." And who came in to try and heal thebreach? Why, Jack Canfield, the author of "Chicken Soup For TheSoul." You just can't make this stuff up.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
