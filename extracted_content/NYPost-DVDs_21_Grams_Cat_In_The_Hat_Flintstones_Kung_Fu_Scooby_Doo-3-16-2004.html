performance as a born-again ex-con in "21 Grams." 
"21 GRAMS" 
Like director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's pre­
vious work, "Amores Perras," "21 Grams" ($26.98, 
Universal) is a puzzle. Figure out how all the separace 
story lines of an ex-con, a professor and a young 
mother are connected and you're done. It's clever, 
well-acted (thanks to Se'an Penn, Naomi Watts and 
Benedo Del Toro) and punishingl)' serious, but 
once you've solved the puzzle the film loses interest 
"THE CAT IN THE HAT" 
\Vatch this movie ($26.98, Universa]) and watch 
your kids' brains turn to mush while destroying the 
memory of a beloved sLory at the san1C time. Extras 
include 16 deleted scenes -bur there's hardly a 
scene in the filnl that didn't deserve to be deleted in 
the first place Read the bookl

stone-age re'tread of «The Honeymooners" "Scooby-
000" is even more enduring (kids love Scooby), bur 
the series ($64.92 each, Vlarner Bros.) is a lut tougher 
for adults to endure. Those meddling kids! 
"KUNG FU": COMPLETE fiRST 
SEASON \~ .. , 
Just as Keith Carra dine triumphs in the new RBO 
western "Deadwood," here comes David Carradine', 
best-known work, "Kung Fu" ($39.98, \Varner Bros) 
This odd series about Caine, a traveling Buddhist 
monk who could kick ass, was a hit in 1972. Its cre­
ators went out of their way to create "art," using odd 
camera angles, cutting to scenes of nature (close-ups 
of leaves are a big motii) and interrupting action 
scenes with flashbacks to the poetic ramblings of 
Caine's mentor. Compellingly strange, it would never 
get on the air toda)'. 
Also om: 
"Scenes From a Marriage" ($49.95, Criterion) 
which presents both the theatrical version and the 
original Swedish miniseries cut of Ingmar Berg­
man's classic because Criterion always does exactl), 
what film buffs would hope for; "Dave Gahan: Live 
Monsters" ($19.99, Mute), directed by Anton Corbijn, 
is a solo concert in Paris b)' the driving force of De­
peche Mode; "The Commitments Collectors Edi 
tion" ($26.98, Fox) is bursting with extras about this 
1991 fan favorite; Cate Blanchett is so good she can get 
people to take even a Joel Schumacher film seriously, 
in this case "Veronica Guerin" ($29.99, Touch­
stone); "Winnie the Pooh: Springtime With Roo" 
($29.99, Disney) has an Easter theme, though adults 
will still miss the voice of Sebastian Cabot; "AbFab 
Series 5" ($34.98, BBC America) is a definite step up 
from the sad Series 4, though still not quite up to the 
standards of the scandalous first episodes; "Prime 
Su.spect 2 and 3" (529.98 each,HBO) are out to re­
mind us of hOV~T sensational Helen l\1irren and this 
classic shov! were.
