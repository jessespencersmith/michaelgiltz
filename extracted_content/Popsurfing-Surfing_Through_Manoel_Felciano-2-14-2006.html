            <p>T U E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 4 ,  2 0 0 6Surfing Through Manoel FelcianoI saw the new Broadway production of Sweeney Todd recently andloved it. I knew Michael Cerveris and Patti Lupone would be terrific, ofcourse. The big find for me was Manoel Felciano as Toby -- he wasmagnetic. Last night I saw him at Ars Nova, a 99 seat theater that oftenhosts Broadway stars giving informal shows on Monday nights whentheir show is black. Manoel -- who has a battered beauty akin to GaelGarcia Bernal -- was charming and amusing and definitely showed hispreference for pop and rock over show tunes. He also was generouswith the spotlight -- showcasing his one-time roomie in a song they'dperformed in their band and bringing up buddies from Yale to do an acapella version of "How High The Moon." The main focus was on songsthat served as touchstones for Manoel including Steely Dan's "Peg,"George Michael's "One More Try," and a duet on Mariah Carey's"Vision of Love" that was funny, proved how difficult that guiltypleasure is to sing and would go to Number One if released as a single.The final surprise was a song from his musical director's musical TheHidden Sky. The title tune, it was terrifically engaging and original andmade you want to hear more, just like the first time I saw Manoelhimself. A real talent.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
