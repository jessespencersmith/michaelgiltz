7/27/2005 04:00:00 AMYesterday, Americablog gave Stewart grief for his weakinterview with Sen. Rick Santorum. When you have a racisthate-mongering radical on your show, it's important to showthem for who they are. That doesn't mean attacking orscreaming at them. But Stewart is funny and quick-witted; heshould have been able to illustrate how dumb and hatefulSantorum is with a few well-placed quips. If you're gonnashowcase a bigot, at least TRY to challenge their narrowthinking. Apparently, we weren't the only ones criticizing him.Stewart opened Tuesday's show by saying everyone wastalking about the Santorum interview, lots of controversy, blahblah blah with people discussing the "general suckiness" of it.Others, he said, thought it "suuUUUUUCKED!" Wednesday'sguest was actress Diane Lane; Stewart promised to makeamends by bringing her down. So Stewart deftly andcharmingly acknowledged the criticism. Though he didn'tnecessarily say he agreed with it -- Stewart might well argueit's not his job to "get" guests. But when you're giving nationalexposure to a fringe bigot, it's kind of important.Still, he admitted disappointing people and did it in a funny andamusing way. Stewart's definitely one of the good guys. (Andthat interview with Lane? Not so good. Interviewing isdefinitely Stewart's weakest skill, which is why the interviewsare usually quite brief.)
