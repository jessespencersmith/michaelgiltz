            <p>F R I D AY,  O C TO B E R  1 3 ,  2 0 0 6Bookstore Sales Continue To FallAnd they don't know why. Hmm, maybe high prices for hardcovers andincreasingly absurd high prices for paperbacks that come out a year ortwo or more after the hardcover? Maybe charging $15 for 50 year oldnovels, even when they're part of a 12 volume series you expect readersto buy each and every one of? Holding back on paperback releaseswhen the rest of the world often offers hardcover and paperbackreleases simultaneously? Trying to make people pay twice to own abook electronically instead of including it in the cost of a hardcover andoffering the eBook as an expected "extra" the way DVDs offer loads ofextras? Doing the same with audio book versions? Imagine if youbought a hardcover and got both a key to download an audio versionfor your iPod or car and an eBook version you could put on your PDAor EBook reader and take with you on a plane or wherever. Suddenly,hardcovers might seem cutting edge and fun rather than overpriced.Meanwhile, some idiots still think libraries should only carry booksTHEY approve of. Why do libraries feel obliged to cave in to pressurelike this? By their own admission, not one book had EVER beenchallenged by a library patron. So the very first time it happens, insteadof saying, gee, you're the only person who has ever objected, if youthink a book is "bad," don't check it out; instead of doing that, theypulled the books, and formed a committee to decide what books in thefuture should be allowed onto their shelves. Nice going. The graphicnovel "Blankets," by the way, is very good.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
