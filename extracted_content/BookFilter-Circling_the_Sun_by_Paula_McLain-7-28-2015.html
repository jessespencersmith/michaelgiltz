Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayBeryl Markham is one of those captivating figures that loom large in literary history. Her memoir "West With TheNight" is rediscovered with regularity and no wonder: it's filled with stirring tales and captures the joy of flight likefew others. The fact that Markham crossed paths (to say the least) with the likes of Isak Dinesen while strikingher own fearless path in Kenya makes her all the more appealing. Still, for those who have read that classicmemoir, telling Markham's life in a work of fiction is rather audacious. Happily, Paula McLain -- author of themassive bestseller "The Paris Wife" -- is up to the task. She gets under the skin of Markham, brings herchildhood more vividly to the front and against all expectations brings us right up to the moment when ourheroine literally begins to soar. The story of a famed aviatrix that stops before the flying begins? McLain wiselyforges her own path, just like Markham, circling around and under and through that famed memoir while creatinga fully realized character. For fans of Alexandra Fuller. -- Michael GiltzWhat Others Say“Paula McLain is considered the new star of historical fiction, and for good reason. Fans of The Paris Wife will becaptivated by Circling the Sun, which . . . is both beautifully written and utterly engrossing.”—Ann Patchett, CountryLiving “Paula McLain cements herself as the writer of historical fictional memoir with Circling the Sun, giving vivid voice toBeryl Markham, a singular, extraordinary woman. In McLain’s confident hands, Markham crackles to life, and wereaders truly understand what made a woman so far ahead of her time believe she had the power to soar.”—JodiPicoult, author of Leaving Time  “The Paris Wife is good, but Circling the Sun is much better. . . . She was too much for her times, but in Circling theSun [Beryl] Markham finally gets the treatment she deserves. That it also makes for bold, absorbing fiction is somuch the better. No complaints here.”—New York Daily News “Paula McLain is yet another twenty-first-century woman who can write rings around the hyper-masculine men whodominate so much…MoreWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
