This week's DVDs 
TJie<40-Year-Old 
Virgin ***y, 
Univ~sal; $29.98 
The dirty little secret 
about "outrageous" come­
dies like "Harold & Kumar 
Go to White Castle," 
"Road Trip" and 
"40-Year-Old Virgin" is 
that -at heart -they're 
very sweet. This steve 
Carell charmer (with 
Catherine Keener winning 
as his true love) is no ex­
ception. Avoid the unrated 
edition, whi~h pads the 
film with an extra 17 min­
utes. Comedies should be 
short and sweet. 
Airplane: The "Don't 
Call Me Shirley" Edition 
**** Paramount; $19.99 If one joke a minute is 
funny, then surely five 
jokes a minute (however 
lame they may be) is even 
funnier. Yes, that's true, 
but don't call this movie 
Shirley. A dumb and 
dumber -and funny and 
funnier -spoof of air­
plane disaster movies that 
holqs up surprisingly well. 
Loads of deleted scenes 
and funny commentary. 
Roll Bounce *** Fox; $27.98 
In 1977, Bow Wow and 
his buddies are heartbro­
ken when the local roller­
skating rink shuts down. 
They head crosstown to 
the flashier rink where a 
"skate-off" against an 
older, savvier team is as By MICHAEL GllTZ 
inevitable as the sound­
track of funky songs like 
Chic's "Le Freak." Young 
love, stern parents and an 
earful of Bee Gees and 
Donna Summer tunes 
make this a nice surprise. 
The Ray Harryhausen 
Gift Set *** Sony; $49.95 
Perhaps the only special­
effects auteur, Harryhau­
sen gets deluxe treatment 
with a handful of B movies 
(including1955's "It Came 
from Beneath the Sea" and 
1956's "Earth vs. th~ Flying 
Saucers") in nice new 
prints, with solid extras 
and a substantial Harry­
hausen documentary.
