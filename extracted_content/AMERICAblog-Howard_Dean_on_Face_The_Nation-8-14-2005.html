8/14/2005 12:22:00 PM"Today, in [The Washington Post] there was an article that saidthe troops STILL don't have the proper equipment. What arethese people doing that are running the armed forces? I'll tellyou what they're doing. People like the President and peoplelike Secretary Rumsfeld are ignoring the advice of careerexperts like General Shinseki who told them before we went inthat we needed adequate equipment and adequate troops.They thrust that aside. These people do not know what they'redoing that are running this country. They have no conception ofwhat it is to fight a war because none of them ever have."-- Howard DeanUsing a question on Intelligent Design, Dean turned it into acomment on Bush and how he ignores facts:"it never pays to ignore facts. Reason we're in trouble in Iraq?The President didn't care what the facts were. The reason wehave an almost $8 trillion national debt? The President didn'tcare what the facts were. The facts matter. The truth is youcan't run a business, a state, a country or a family if you don'tcare what the facts are."Dean's four word platform for running against Republicans:"We can do better."
