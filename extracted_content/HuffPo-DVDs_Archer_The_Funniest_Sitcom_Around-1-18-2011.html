ARCHER SEASON ONE  (Fox; $29.98) -- Let me put my cards on the table: the animated, raunchy,
very adult spy show Archer  is the funniest sitcom on TV. You can catch up with the first 10 episodes right
now. Season two starts January 27  at 10 p.m. on fx. Either way, you'll enjoy the savviest voice cast on TV,
including Jessica Walter and (sometimes) Jeffrey Tambor from Arrested Development , the hilarious
Aisha Tyler and Chris Parnell and above all the drolly deadpan H. Jon Benjamin as the drunken, sexist,
lazy but somehow effective field agent Sterling Archer aka "Duchess." It's basically a work place comedy
given a new spin by having the work place be a for-hire spy agency and our Matt Helm-like hero having
to endure his overbearing boss, also known as his mother. The sexual gags are very explicit so this is notfor people who find South Park  crass. But if your taste runs a little blue, you're gonna love this show,
which is wildly quotable and -- thanks to Benjamin and Tyler -- features the sexiest, funniest duo on TVsince Dave and Maddie sparred on Moonlighting . Yep, I'm a fan.

<p>LEBANON  ($38.96 BluRay or $28.95 regular DVD; Sony) -- The top winner at Venice, I was really
looking forward to Lebanon , a film about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon as seen through the eyes of
soldiers in one tank headed into enemy territory. I thought it might be a corker a la Das Boot. And while
it's true I've never actually seen a film about an Israeli tank crew, the movie proved unfortunatelyfamiliar. Actually, it came across like a play, thanks to the movie being set almost entirely inside the tank,
with glimpses of the outside world coming through the viewfinder. The crew is the usual grab-bag of
types, from the military regular to the raw recruit to the nervous gunner and the cynical weapons loaderwho always questions everything. These are the nicest soldiers imaginable: they are wary of using theirweapons for fear of hurting civilians to the point of rebellion, discuss everything (even though the leader
tries to shortchange this), try and protect a prisoner from a suspicious "ally" who wants to torture and
probably kill the guy and even place a call to one of the guys' mother to assure her he's ok. No points forguessing which one of them doesn't make it.
THE RICKY GERVAIS SHOW SEASON ONE  ($29.98; Warner Bros.) -- What a scandal! Ricky
Gervais was cheeky last year at the Golden Globes. He promised to be even more insulting this yearbecause he never planned to do it again. And then...he was even more insulting and cheeky this year!
What nerve! Oh how he blindsided them. What...what CHEEK! And what exactly did they expect? The
only thing cheekier would be to take one of the most successful podcasts of all time and then lazily -- yeslazily, you heard me right, Mr. Gervais -- repurpose it into an animated series. Gervais doesn't have to
actually do any work and because the animators sometimes visualize some of the nutty asides of the three
hosts, Gervais can actually pretend it's worth listening to again. And, oddly, amusingly, it is. What abastard.

<p>THE AMERICAN  ($39.98 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; Universal) -- Some complained about the
marketing of this film. Universal sold it as a thinking man's action flick, with George Clooney as our
provocative hero (a man who builds custom-made guns for assassins). But what would you have done?
Sold it as an unsuccessful, dull arthouse film? Of course not. Anton Corbijn follows up Control  with this
less-satisfying but no less ambitious tale which plays like a European art film, studying the lonely andisolated Clooney as he holes up in a small town, beds a local prostitute (who is of course gorgeous enoughto be a runway model) and maybe, perhaps falls in love while he strives (not unreasonably) to avoid being
killed. Made with good intentions all around but the screenplay's cliches let it down. I would point out
one very clever touch I hope becomes standard on all titles, and not just some BluRays. This offers uHear,which lets the film jump back about five or so seconds and briefly turns on the English subtitles. That
way, if a line of dialogue is muddied or hard to hear, you can catch it quickly without having to
laboriously go through the steps of turning the subtitle function on and off. Well done!
JERSEY SHORE SEASON TWO UNCENSORED  ($29.99; MTV/Paramount) -- It's not the end of
the world. But you'll wish it were.

<p>DANCES WITH WOLVES 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION/RAGING BULL 30TH
ANNIVERSARY EDITION  ($29.99 each on BluRay; MGM) -- They came out a decade apart but these
films are weirdly linked in my mind. Raging Bull's  loss to Ordinary People  is considered one of the
Academy Award's greatest blunders. Personally, I will defend to the death the excellent film by Robert
Redford, which is no embarrassment as an Oscar winner. However, Scorsese's film and Robert DeNiro's
towering performance do loom over it and indeed most other movies. It looks amazing on BluRay and of
course features some all-new extras. Dances With Wolves  is in some quarters considered another major
Oscar blunder for keeping Scorsese's GoodFellas  from winning Best Picture in 1990. Again, I considered
both movies among the best of that year, so won't call it a shonda. But yes, GoodFellas  is the other
masterpiece by Scorsese (along with The Last Waltz ) and is a tremendous film. Dances  looks and sounds
good but unfortunately they do the film no favors by ONLY including the near 4 hour director's cut.Whatever you think of each version (and the four hour director's cut is a slog, in my opinion), fans should
never have to choose. You should always include both the theatrical version and any extended cut option
on the same disc. Even if you don't, you certainly should make both available. Putting out only thedirector's cut instead of the substantially different version that was a worldwide smash and swept the
Oscars cheats everyone, including Kevin Costner.
DARK SKIES COMPLETE SERIES  ($44.99; Shout) -- One of the great side effects of The X-Files  was
that it allowed other networks to gamble on smart, wildly ambitious shows like this one. Almostforgotten, it's been given a loving boxed set by Shout, which collects the entire show (including the
international version of the pilot) and loads of extras. How's this for paranoid conspiracy theories: muchof our post-war history is a lie meant to cover up a threatened alien invasion and everyone (I do mean
everyone) is in on it. Our heroes are two young idealistic people who head to Camelot (I mean JFK's DC),
one ot work for a Congressman and the other to work for Jackie. They're soon on the run when theyuncover this massive conspiracy. Hitting the road, they investigate every odd happening of the Sixties(which means they're very busy) while the conspiracy grows and grows and grows. (Vietnam? Just an
excuse for the alien fighters to get more funding.) I've only watched the pilot so far but the show is great
fun and you can always judge a series by its cast: Eric Close, Megan Ward and Jeri Lynn Ryan are justsome of the names it can boast of. Nicely done all around. (Note: I can't speak to whether the set
maintains all the original music cues used when the show first aired.)

<p>ARMY OF CRIME  ($34.95 BluRay or $29.95 regular DVD; Lorber) -- A French film about the
Resistance directed by Robert Guediguian. It's based on the true story of the Manouchians -- 30 or so
French patriots who wrecked havoc for a while on the Nazis in their midst only to be rounded up andsummarily shot. The film could serve as a master class for the obvious. It begins with a voice over namingthe names of each beloved patriot. When something tragic happens, classical music is certain to swell on
the soundtrack. Or things move in slow motion. Or they move in slow motion AND the classical music
swells. And the roll call is repeated at the end. It's always fun to see the Nazis get outwitted. (Sorry,
Germany.) And the Manouchians, as portrayed in this film, at least, are certainly the best-looking
members of the Resistance imaginable. Thomas Elek (played by Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet) is called a"dirty Yid" by a fellow student but surely the guy is just jealous of how handsome Elek is. Few movies
embody the idea of "pedestrian" more perfectly.
AN ULTIMATE GULLIVER COLLECTON  ($15.99; American Pop/Virgil) -- An unintended but
happy consequence of the ill-fated Jack Black spin on Gulliver's Travels  is this jam-packed DVD. The
picture quality is just so-so. Frankly, the animated 1939 Gulliver's Travels  at the heart of the set will
probably never be properly restored, despite its significance in animation history. But this DVD is
admirably bursting with items and certainly makes up in quantity what it lacks in superior image quality.You get the okay Fleischer film (the first full-length animated feature after Disney's Snow White  and an
innovator in the never-quite-successful strategy of rotoscoping (which involves filming actors and thenanimating over their movements). But you also get seven animated shorts starring Gabby, a character inthe film that the Fleischers spun off into a string of shorts. And you get a 1965 Japanese anime spin-off
of the Swift character called Gulliver's Travels Beyond The Moon.  AND to top it off you get a Melies
short from 1902 called - rather laboriously -- Gulliver's Travels Among The Lilliputians and the Giants.
For hardcore animation buffs, this is a low-budget treat.
