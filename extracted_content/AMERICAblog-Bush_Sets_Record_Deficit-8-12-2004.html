8/12/2004 09:28:00 AM"The Bush administration is projecting that the deficit for all of the2004 budget year, which ends Sept. 30, will be $445 billion. This yearwill mark the third consecutive budget deficit after four straight yearsof surpluses that reflected the economic boom of the 1990s," per AP.That's the biggest annual deficit ever. Way to go, Bush! He countersthat as a percentage of GDP, it's still not as big as the record deficitRonald Reagan set during the Eighties. True, but we believe in youand know you can do it, Georgie! By the way, why isn't THIS a leaditem on the New York Times website? It was prominent for a fewminutes but now you have to search for it. Boy, the liberal media ain'tall it's cracked up to be.
