In an exclusive interview with the new gay blog
Queer Sighted,  daytime soap star Brett Claywell
talks about the abrupt ending of the ground-breaking "Kish" storyline on One Life To Live.  ("Kish" is the
nickname for the romance between Kyle Lewis, the openly gay but devious lab tech, and Oliver Fish, thestraight arrow closeted cop). Interestingly, the out gay character is played by Claywell, who's straight,
while the closeted cop is played by out actor Scott Evans.
In fact, Claywell had just given a previously-scheduled interview to Queer Sighted  about his career
moments before he walked into the One Life To Live  offices -- the actor had intended to turn in his
Emmy reel selection, but the his visit soon took an alternate route.
"Frank [Valentini, the executive producer] saw me, came and got me, we walked into his office, and he
closed both doors," remembers Claywell. "And when they close both doors, you know it's going to be an

Talks...interesting conversation. It shook me; it definitely shook me."
At least Claywell found out his storyline with "Kish" was over in person. Evans found out about the
change via Twitter.

Dawson's Creek ), the strange treatment of One Life To Live  at the GLAAD awards and his plans for the

i am SOOOOO DISAPPOINT ED IN OLTL....
great writing, really courageous , then they do this to these great charachter s???
Kudos to the actors, read his interview applaud his comments about standing up and being
advocates for those who don't have a voice...
i'm straight, but it's as if gay peole don't exist in daytime for the most part, so i really felt this was
such a lovely couple, oh well, Virginia, i guess there is no Santa Claus...
nice,real nice...
it's a shame that OLTL did not want to continue this story. even more of a shame that they couldn't
write out a better exit for kyle and oliver.
hope the two actors move on to successful careers though after this.

1 FansThanks for this article in QS. I was one of many who loved this wonderfull y thought out and well
played story line. One Life to Live's decision to end Kish the way they did was very unexpected as
the couple was involved in a major story which is still on going. Brett and Scott ( but really Brett )were so good together. I look forward to seeing more of Brett in future projects. I
I liked "Kish." It was a ground-bre aking storyline. Too bad OLTL didn't have the guts to continue it.
