Glows And The Best Of 2015

ONCE UPON A MATTRESS  ** 1/2 out of ****
ABRON ARTS CENTER
THE COLOR PURPLE  ** 1/2 out of ****
BERNARD B. JACOBS THEATRE
Both of these musicals have a lot in common. Both are pretty weak, with
Purple  especially weak in the score and Mattress  weak in the book. But
both are elevated by outstanding casts. We'll probably never see a betterproduction of The Color Purple;  this one is so good it almost tricks you
into thinking the show itself is worthwhile. Mattress  can be harmless fun
with the right pros on board and the right attitude -- Transport Group'sproduction happily has both.
First, the little show that could. Once Upon A Mattress  was a memorable
success for composer Mary Rodgers. It takes the old fairy tale of "The
Princess And The Pea" and expands that into pleasing entertainment. The
show is so old school you might believe it's winkingly retro rather than
just traditional down to its toes.
Genially overstuffed, it has a solo showcase for a hoofer (a fleet, fit Cory
Lingner), some silent clowning (David Greenspan), a star-crossed subplot
(a handsome Zak Resnick and the pretty, strong-voiced Jessica Fontana),comic nonsense (Jay Rogers as the Wizard) and eye candy (Hunter Ryan
Herdlicka). In short, something for everyone.Theater: Once Upon  a Fairy Tale; Color Purple  Glows And The Best Of 2015</p>
<p>Happily, director Jack Cummings III, a game cast and a robust 12-strong
orchestra (!) conducted by Matt Castle with excellent orchestrations by
Castle and Frank Galgano have exactly the right take on this hoary
chestnut.
They turn a modest budget into a virtue by drawing attention to the
scenic illustrations of Ken Fallin, which are literally drawn for each scene
while we watch. Once Upon A Mattress  needs characters, actors who
don't fit neatly into an ensemble (an attribute that's a dying art in a worldwhere every school expects every student to be a bland triple threat). It's
got 'em. John Epperson aka Lypsinka is a delight as the wicked Queen.
How marvelous to realize an actor known for not speaking in fact has aformidable vocal instrument. (It's also clever of them to have Goodman, apioneering artist in his own right and known for his vocal acrobatics
playing essentially a mute.) Herdlicka, whose name must have been a
field day for his fellow cast members, proves far more versatile than onemight have expected from his handsome demeanor. (This isn't a show for
lookers , darn it!) As the Minstrel, he showed off the best voice of the night
and charm to spare, acting with aplomb while blending in with the
ensemble as needed. When Aladdin  needs a new title actor, Herdlicka
could fill the role nicely.
Above all, it has the great pleasure of Jackie Hoffman as Princess
Winifred, the strong-willed gal made famous by Carol Burnett. Being a
princess of a certain age adds a poignant sweetness to Winifred that
Hoffman mines easily. Once Upon A Mattress  isn't much when all is said
and done, but when a talented ensemble is having this much fun, you're
sure to do so as well.
Similarly, The Color Purple  is blessed by an excellent cast. The film
version by Steven Spielberg was elevated by Oprah Winfrey, Danny
Glover and Whoopi Goldberg in a star-making turn. Guess what? The
stage musical is elevated by Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Danielle
Brooks of Orange Is The New Black,  Kyle Scatliffe as Harpo and Cynthia</p>
<p>Erivo in a star-making turn as Celie.
They're all very lucky to be in a production overseen with elegant
simplicity by director John Doyle. I didn't see the original, but by all
accounts it was a glossy, spare-no-expense production. (It makes sense,since the movie was also glossy, emphasizing the fairy tale quality of theredemption close at hand in Alice Walker's novel.) Here instead of "spare
no expense" we have simply "spare," courtesy of Doyle's set design,
which features fractured wooden screens and a whole lot of chairs. Placethem in rows and you've got a church. Have men lift up chairs and"plow"
the stage with the legs and you've got a field. Women carrying baskets on
their hips are in America. Simply lift them up above their heads andsuddenly you believe we're in Africa. It's theatrical imagination at its best.
The show needs it. The blunt story finds the beaten down Celie (Erivo)
facing one nightmare after another in Act One: molestation by her father,children ripped out of her arms, an abusive husband and a sister she is
cruelly led to believe died long ago. Act two becomes just as abruptly
happy, with Celie finding self-esteem and business savvy with a needleand thread, not to mention the humanity to forgive and even befriend thecruel men in her life. The herky jerky book is by Marsha Norman and
Brenda Russell and the unmemorable music and lyrics are by Allee Willis
and Stephen Bray. (Frankly, Spielberg's movie overseen musically byQuincy Jones has better musical numbers even though it's nominally a
drama.)
If you're choosing between the film and the stage musical, I'd still send
you to Walker's original novel, whose memorable voice of Celie as
narrator overcomes all complaints about plot and character. But if you'vegot the chance, by all means rush out to see the original cast in this
revival. Jennifer Hudson isn't much of a stage actress (yet) and her big</p>
<p>songs -- especially the rote juke joint romp "Push Da Button" -- are
forgettable. But she's got presence and a marvelous voice to spin them
into something vivid.
Brooks has the indomitable Sophie to assay and makes the most of a
character with very little subtlety. Paired with her is Scatliffe as the sweet-natured Harpo. And the entire cast is committed wholly to the life-
affirming material, from the church lady Greek chorus to the many
supporting roles. (Isaiah Johnson is not as forbidding as Mister should benor as believably redemptive as Glover managed in the film.)
Absolutely none of this matters (much) when Cynthia Erivo is holding your
attention. Since Celie is the center of the entire show, that's naturallymost of the evening. And she's a delight. Her performance to my mind
was just a tiny bit one-note, with the stage not allowing her to bring the
subtlety to abrupt one word line readings that Goldberg nailed in themovie.
On the other hand, the material is  awfully thin. And she brings it to life
with a marvelous winning presence and a voice that is huge yet never
showing off. The audience roared its approval when this slowlyblossoming character belted out her defiance and no wonder. I've no
desire to see The Color Purple  ever again. But I can't wait to see Erivo in
something new. Given the reaction of the crowd I saw it with, that's going
to be quite a while. I'm confident it will be worth the wait.
