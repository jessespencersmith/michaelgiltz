3/21/2005 01:46:00 AMYes, as you already know, Bush ended his vacation early -- avirtually unprecendented act for a President who spends a LOTof time on vacation -- and rushed back to DC so he could scorepolitical points on the painful private decision surrounding TerriSchiavo. Obviously, this took hours and hours of time when thepapers he went to sign could have been flown to him in Texaswithout much difference. But this issue was too important andhe wanted to spend hours flying there to emphasize to the farright how he had come through for them.Now let's think about the many other times when Bush couldn'tbe bothered to spend an hour or two on an issue and decide ifany of them were more important.1. The tsunami victims -- More than 100,000 people died inthe worst natural disaster of our lifetime. Millions were lefthomeless. It happened just after Christmas and hit hard ourstaunch ally, Thailand. (Many, many Muslims were devastatedby this disaster.) Bush couldn't be bothered to step outside forFIVE minutes and offer his heartfelt sympathy to an event thathad the rest of the world riveted and shocked. It took BushDAYS to do anything, even after his aides had bungled our firstoffer of aid.2. Investigating 9/11 with Congress -- Bush spent monthshemming and hawing and avoiding having to meet with thebipartisan panel trying to look into the worst attack on US soilin history. He finally, grudgingly, spent a few hours but insistedhe appear with Cheney by his side, cause they were busy andneeded to get this over with.3. Heck, 9/11 itself -- On the day of the worst attack on USsoil in our history, Bush spent hours and hours flying aroundthe country when he could have just spent a few minutes toget in front of a camera and reassure the nation that he was incharge and we'd get through this.4. Military funerals -- Bush is the first President in US historyduring wartime (and presumably peacetime as well) who hasrefused to attend a SINGLE military funeral to honor one of ourfallen soldiers. It's not just the couple of hours he can't bebothered to spend; Bush thinks it would be bad politics toremind people that young men and women die in war, so whybother honoring them? They can take a hit on the battlefield,but Bush won't risk taking a hit in the polls. And if things aregoing so swimmingly in Iraq, why does he STILL refuse tohonor our military?Got any examples of your own?
