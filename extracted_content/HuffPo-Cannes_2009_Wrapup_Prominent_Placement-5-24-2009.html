 Cannes 2009 Day Twelve: Haneke
Triumphs With Top Prize
Read More:  Australia , Camera d'Or , Cannes Film Festival,
China , CoCo Chanel , Korea , Palme d'Or , Thailand , Entertainment News
While the critics agreed overwhelmingly that Un
Prophete  was the best film in Cannes, the 2009
Palme d'or went to Michael Haneke's The WhiteRibbon,  amid strong applause from the French
and German contingent in the press. Since the
head of the jury was Isabelle Hubert and she
scored one of her major triumphs by starring in
Haneke's brilliant, corrosive The Piano Teacher
(for which she won Best Actress at Cannes), itperhaps shouldn't have been a surprise.
Un Prophete  received the Grand Jury Prize, ie.
the runner-up award. Charlotte Gainsbourg deservedly nabbed the Best Actress award for her
primal turn in Lars Von Trier's Anti-Christ  while Christoph Waltz got Best Actor for his star-
making turn in Quentin Tarantino's WW II flick Inglourius Basterds. The Best Screenplay award
went to China's Spring Fever,  Best Director went to the Phillipine's Brillante Mendoza for Kinatay
and a tip of the hat -- the Prixe Exceptionnel du Jury -- went to the great Alain Resnais who had hisfirst film in decades appear in Competition. The third runner-up award -- the Prix du Jury -- wassplit between UK's Fish Tank  and Korea's vampire flick Thirst . And the Camera d'or for best first
feature went to the highly accomplished Warwick Thornton for his Aussie drama  Samson &
Delilah.
The Oscars have nothing on Cannes for brevity and wit and fun. The remaining press corps tumbles
into a side theater while the black tie audience numbering in the thousands fills the main theater,the Lumiere. In about 50 minutes, all the awards are handed out, with the press corps hooting andbooing the choices it disapproves of and clapping loudly for its favorites. Strong boos greeted
Thirst , but they were drowned out moments later by even stronger boos for Mendoza as the Best
Director of the fest. While some agreed his film Kinatay  was a step forward from Serbis , it was
widely panned nonetheless. The muddled Chinese gay flick Spring Fever  might have deserved
recognition for daring (the director bended the rules just to get the film made and it broaches the

<p>Michael Giltz: Cannes 2009 Day Twelve: Haneke Triumphs With Top Prize
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/cannes-2009-day-twelve-ha_b_207204.html [5/24/2009 11:51:55 PM]taboo topic of homosexuality with frankness) or acting or cinematography but the one area it
probably didn't deserve notice was its weak and cliched screenplay.
Terry Gilliam had fun when he was brought out to hand over the Best Director award: he pretended
he had won and started making all his thank yous and then broke down in tears when the truthwas told. But probably the most popular award of all among the journalists was to Waltz for hismesmerizing turn as the "Jew hunter" in Tarantino's Inglourius Basterds . Tarantino says he came
to believe he'd written a role impossible to cast and despaired of finding an actor who could speakfive languages with aplomb until Waltz strolled in right before they were going to pull the plug on
the film. Fittingly, he gave his thanks in English, French and German.
Perhaps the best-reviewed film of the fest was Romania's Police, Adjective,  which was in Un
Certain Regard. But it didn't even win that category, whose top prize went to Dogtooth , another
admired film. The Critics' Week winner was Farewell, Gary. And Xavier Dolan's  I Killed My
Mother  dominated the Directors Fortnight, winning three top prizes.
I also saw four movies on the final day of the fest:
SPRING FEVER  ** (out of four) -- I stayed with this gay drama longer than most of my fellow
critics did, I believe. It was interesting just to see drag bars and punk bars in China and fascinating
to see how a gay person might stand out while walking down the street but still not be pegged as
"gay" because such a concept is so thoroughly stifled in that country. Unfortunately, what's not
stifled is melodrama. A married man has a passionate romance with a boyfriend who is clearly gaybecause he wears a jaunty scarf everywhere and walks with a certain elan. The suspicious wife hasthem followed by a straight guy, who promptly falls for the gay lover after the wife confronts the
man at work and drives him out of their lives. Then the private eye's girlfriend (or wife, it's not
quite clear) gets wind of THEIR romance and takes matters into her own hands. It's just a plottwist too much, with a subplot about an off the books factory that's raided by the police adding to
the confusion. I was thrilled that -- while people died for love -- they didn't die because they hated
being gay. But only gay audiences and Asian cinema specialists will find this worth sloggingthrough. Director Lou Ye's films remain more interesting for their political daring than theirsubstance.
IN THE BEGINNING  ** -- Based on a true story, it follows a con man let out of prison who
starts tracking down construction sites and then -- posing as a rep for the site -- bilking local stores
out of equipment rentals and selling the machinery off for a quick buck. Quite unexpectedly, hestumbles on a really big site that hasn't happened. A small town still hasn't recovered from the dayconstruction on Highway 61 was abruptly halted two years earlier. Just the presence of our anti-
hero as a rep of the construction firm sends everyone from the beautiful female mayor down to the
maid in the local hotel into nervous hope. Slowly but surely, the con man switches from building upa pile of kickback money for an easy getaway into a man determined to get the highway finished
and everyone paid off so at least he can claim he did something with his life. It unfolds just as
you'd expect, with no surprises and no revelation that might win your sympathy. Decently done,but unabsorbing.
VISAGES  ** -- Tsai Ming-Liang delivers his latest series of mournful vignettes, this time devoted
to a movie shoot. A director is filming Salome  in a Paris museum and along the way we see parents
of crew members breathe their last, romances blossom, actors trudge behind the scenes with
laborious costumes or lugging a deer's head and so on. Some of them work beautifully, such as the
personal assistant who walks into his kitchen to get a glass of water and suddenly faces a burst pipethat grows worse and worse and worse with hilarious results. But the set-up of the film is
unnecessarily vague: I knew that it was about a director filming Salome  on location because I
glanced at the press notes; otherwise I might still be scratching my head. Tsai undeniably has a
vivid eye but this one is very hard going.
COCO CHANEL AND IGOR STRAVINSKY  * 1/2 -- Respectably muted, this film is based on a
novel about Coco Chanel's affair with composer Igor Stravinsky. It begins with a riot at the
premiere of Stravinsky's "Le sacre du Printemps," which should provide solace to all the Cannes
directors like Von Trier and Gasper Noe who got booed at THEIR premieres. Their movies weren't
bad: they're just misunderstood geniuses. It's all downhill from there: with nary a word spokenbetween them, Coco and Igor are suddenly making love non-stop at her country villa, never mind
that the house is bursting with Igor's ailing wife and four children. Why should that stop them
from mounting each other in the middle of the day in the study, which has gigantic bay windowslooking out onto the gardens where the children play? Don't be bourgeois and suggest this is

about sums it up. It would be nice to say this amoral indifference to others was fun, but it isn't.
Coco merely slinks through rooms with all the panache of the model that actress Anna Mouglalis
was for years (for Chanel, actually). He composes great music, she creates Chanel No 5 and historyis made! Just not cinematic history.
