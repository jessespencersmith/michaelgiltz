Lots of theater to catch up on, so here we go.
THE INTERMINABLE SUICIDE OF GREGORY
CHURCH  *** 1/2 out of ****
St. Ann's Warehouse
I've heard about Daniel Kitson for years.  He's a
performer who alternates between stand-up comedy and
"story shows," monologues built around a particular
story or theme. St. Ann's has brought over his latestpiece and it's marvelous. Yes, it's only January, but I'mcertain we'll still remember this work fondly at the end
of the year. How exactly a shambling fellow with a
speech impediment decided he should be a performer is
probably a story worth its own show, but Kitson is a natural. It runs through January 30 so do what you
must to see it.
Kitson strolls out and immediately disarms his audience. A lot might be made up, he begins, but this part
is true: he was going around the UK, looking for a home to buy. At one home, Kitson stumbled on a cache
of 30,000 letters written by Gregory Church, a man the estate agent was forced to admit had killedhimself. Kitson didn't take the home but he did take the letters and found himself immersed in Church's
life for the next two years as he worked through every letter and reply one by one.
In the very first letter, Church plans to kill himself. But when he sends out a pile of final goodbyes (often
to strangers and with little or no hint that he was planning to off himself), Church unexpectedly gets
some responses. A decent fellow, he takes another day to respond to those letters, which bring their ownresponses back again and on and on and soon enough 20 years have passed. We get to know a string ofindelible characters, from the caustic fellow at the local newspaper -- who refuses to print Church's final

<p>statement to the world and suggests he keep living, if only so he can learn how to write decently -- to a
bullied teenager to the timid bank clerk and the mysterious woman who may or may not be Church's onetrue love.
This is a wonderfully constructed show: if Kitson introduces a timid female bank clerk, he shows them
becoming friends but just when we start to expect something more, he chides us for trying to will theminto a relationship and informs us that they were and will remain merely good friends. People get older
and die, some marry and move away and throughout they continue their correspondence with Church.
With many documentary films this year, you walk out and wonder which part is true. But Kitson is so
specific and engaging (his string of statistics about the number of letters and responses are peppered
throughout) that you simply walk out wondering what happened to this character and was that one reallyhis lost love?
When my guest wondered if Kitson had invited any of the people involved to come see the show, I
pointed out that he was assuming they actually existed. He was nonplussed and almost a little annoyed at
my suggestion. That's how good Kitson is and I won't miss any of his shows in the future. Another
success for St. Ann's, which gets to look very clever but traveling the world and bringing the best
specialized theater (like Brief Encounter  and Black Watch ) back to New York. Nice work if you can get it
and good for them.
What others are saying:
Ben Brantley of The New York Times  said, "But while this show, which won an Edinburgh Fringe First
Award in 2009, has some of the satisfactions of a cozy literary mystery, it is also a vivid piece of theater."
David Finkle of Theatermania  said, "When Kitson jaunts off-stage, he leaves a question charging the air:
Has life just been proved stranger than fiction, or has fiction just been deployed to promote the wonder
of life? The implied answer: Either way is terrific."
David A. Rosenberg of Backstage  said, "This is an affectionate tour de force, amusing and poignant,
revealing man's implacable desire for endurance."THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST  ** 1/2 out of ****
American Airlines TheatreOscar Wilde's masterpiece The Importance of Being Earnest  must be one of the most indestructible
comedies in history. I've never actually seen a grade school production of this show, but I imagine even
that would be fairly amusing. Certainly when you have the great Brian Bedford as Lady Bracknell, you
know you're in for a treat. He doesn't disappoint, landing even a single word like "Handbag!" with comicaplomb that brings down the house in this handsomely mounted Roundabout production  (their first
Wilde, astonishingly enough). Bedford's Bracknell is no panto exaggeration and this show is no out ofcontrol train that gathers steam with each increasing complication. Bedford also directed and he's madethe very conscious choice to deliver a more deliberate, more genuine Earnest. The resultsare,,,interesting.
Actor Santino Fontana reaps the biggest reward from this approach. He plays Algernon, a character
usually presented at breakneck pace with witticisms tumbling out of his mouth at such a frantic pace that
even Algernon is a bit astonished by them. Not here. Fontana is a very smart, very self-aware, very
purposefully funny Algernon and it's a pleasure to see this talented actor relish each bon mot as it occursto him. His face is the one glowing with delight as Wilde's fantastical plot reveals itself.

<p>David Furr benefits less from this approach. John Worthing has fewer funny lines and his desire to be re-
christened as Earnest to win the woman he loves is so silly it doesn't do to linger too much on absurd
story itself. The two central female roles -- Sarah Topham and Charlotte Parry, names good enough to
serve as Wilde characters in their own right -- seem even more adrift, though they come alive when theyget to play off each other in Act Two.
Is it a coincidence that Act Two -- the one in which Lady Bracknell doesn't appear -- moves the swiftest
and has the most comic momentum? Bedford might better serve himself as a director if he did a show in
which he wasn't acting. But then, who would want Brian Bedford around and not have him act? He's
delicious as Bracknell. But then those pros Dana Ivey and Paxton Whitehead make so little impression in
their roles that you realize how little impact this Earnest truly has. So a great showcase for Fontana andgreat fun for Bedford. That's not bad, but when you're talking about a show as flawlessly funny as thisone, that's not quite enough, either.
What others are saying:Charles Isherwood of The New York Times  said, "This magnificent gorgon, "a monster, without being a
myth," as the horrified Jack describes her at one point, has perhaps never been more imperious, more
indomitable -- or more delectably entertaining -- than in Mr. Bedford's brilliant portrayal, the highlight
of this effervescent revival."
David Finkle of Theatermania  said, "This new Broadway mounting, directed by and starring Brian
Bedford, is as nearly perfect as it gets."
Elizabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post  gave it three out of four stars and said, "Bedford's
straightforward approach as an actor is slightly less effective when he directs. This "Being Earnest" is like
a big, comfortable Cadillac: You may not get brisk accelerations or unexpected flair, but the show hasold-fashioned good looks and rides smoothly."
Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News  gave it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars and said, "Though the new
Broadway revival of Oscar Wilde's satire isn't quite a nonstop delight -- it takes too long to rev up -- it
makes for an enjoyable evening."
Jeremy Gerard of Bloomberg  gave it 2 out of 4 stars and said, "The uneven cast is brightened by two
other fine veterans, Dana Ivey and Paxton Whitehead, as the dour Miss Prism and the befuddled
Reverend Chasuble. They add the dose of satire the production otherwise lacks."
David Sheward of Backstage  said, "Highly stylized and sleekly staged, this is probably the funniest and
sharpest production of the comedy, a favorite on regional and community stages, I've ever seen."
OTHER DESERT CITIES  ** out of ****
Lincoln Center
Old-fashioned or stodgy? The latter, I'm afraid. The new Jon Robin Baitz play is shamelessly traditional:
a powerful family with many secrets comes together over the holidays. Stories are told, recriminations
are exchanged and of course secrets are revealed. Other Desert Cities has a patina of politics -- the
parents Stockard Channing and Stacey Keach are Reaganites while the kids are "rebellious" tv producersand writers -- but you can substitute business for politics and the idea is the same. Resentful kids, stone-
faced parents and an explosion where the Truth comes out.
In this show, the truth isn't just coming out, it's being published: daugher Elizabeth Marvel has come
home with the manuscript for her new book. After years of writer's block, she's turned to the memoir and
talks about the sad dark heart of the family: the oldest son became a black sheep who fell in with radicals
in the 1970s and was implicated in a bombing that took the life of a veteran. That son disappearedforever and the parents -- ostracized for a time by their right-wing "friends" -- never discuss it. But by
God, they'll discuss it now!
Thrown into the mix is the aunt (Linda Lavin) who used to partner with Channing on a string of

<p>screenplays with a Gidget-like heroine but has collapsed in her personal life and is now taking shelter
with people whose politics she despises.
Other Desert Cities  is so conventional, it's hard to say more about it than a shrug of the shoulders.
Memoirs are so commonplace it hardly seems shattering to know Marvel has written one. On the other
hand, it's not so absurd for her parents just to ask her to wait until they've died before hitting the talk
show circuit to make hay out of the most painful moment in their lives, is it? That's the central problem
here: no one is particularly good or bad and none of the "shocking" revelations really changes that for us.
So other than a few peppery lines of dialogue and a few outbursts of genuine emotion, very little occurs
other than the doling out of information to the audience that some or all of the characters have known allalong.
Stockard Channing is a great actress and lovely woman but she has apparently given in to the fears of so
many actresses and is now limited mostly to that sterling voice to deliver her performances. Luckily, itremains a formidable weapon. Linda Lavin as her sister has the lines and character-rich face an actor of
her skill deserves and makes the most of them. It's a pity her role is so slight she can't do more than be a
charming, irascible presence. The bombshell about Lavin's character is so banal, it barely registers with
anyone.
Stacey Keach has the show's one heartfelt moment when he tells his beloved daughter that he's not sure
he'll ever be able to love her ever again. In a boulevard drama of the sort that Broadway used to churn
out regularly, this is such a genuine bolt of feeling that we're almost thrown off. The children are a mixed
lot with Marvel having the much harder task; she uses her voice to dramatic effect so many times you canfeel the wheels turning as she tries to create a full character. Thomas Sadoski is a truth-teller as the
remaining son, but his dialogue is so crammed full of cursing that he just seems like Baitz's outlet for all
the profanity he can't deliver on ABC with Brothers & Sisters.  That show is quite similar to this: great
cast, silly plots and enough talent to go around that every once in a while it lands a punch. Just not
enough for a knockout or even a solid evening of theater.
What others are saying:
Ben Brantley of the New York Times  said, "The only problem with the gorgeously acted Lincoln Center
Theater production of "Other Desert Cities," Jon Robin Baitz's seriously satisfying new play, is that you
probably need to see it five times. That's because there are five members in the cast of this ripping family
drama of politics, domestic and otherwise, and you never want to take your eyes off a single one ofthem."
Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News  gave it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars and said, "Keenly observed
and immensely entertaining."Jeremy Gerard of Bloomberg  said, "Baitz has written a bravely old-fashioned drama packed with much
yelling, many convenient revelations and searing confrontations. Staged at New York's Lincoln Center
Theater with finesse by Joe Mantello, the evening recalls an era made defunct by television. Yet "Other
Desert Cities" has the scent of truth about how families work, and don't work."
Erik Haagensen of Backstage  said, "for anyone who has ever complained that they don't write 'em like
that anymore. Richly dramatic and keenly observant, it's a hugely satisfying mixture of the political and
the personal, grandly acted by a brilliant ensemble of five under Joe Mantello's faultless direction."
Dan Bacalzo of Theatermania  said, "There could not be a better cast than the one assembled for Jon
Robin Baitz's world premiere play, Other Desert Cities, at Lincoln Center's Mitzi Newhouse Theater.
Stockard Channing, Elizabeth Marvel, Stacy Keach, Linda Lavin, and Thomas Sadoski all deliver
masterful performances in director Joe Mantello's finely modulated production."
JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN  * 1/2 out of ****
Brooklyn Academy of Music
I saw a production of John Gabriel Borkman  at the National in London with Paul Scofield, Vanessa
Redgrave and Eileen Atkins, about as starry a cast as one could hope for. It was dreadfully dull. Now I've
seen this production with Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw and Lindsay Duncan. It is faint praise to say thisshow was not as laborious as that one from 1996. And I'm beginning to think the problem lies not with
the shows but with the play. Ibsen's masterpiece of course is A Doll's House. That's followed by Hedda
Gabler. I've even seen a solid production of Brand with Ralph Fiennes. An Enemy of the People, TheMaster Builder, Peer Gynt. All have been done and done passably well. But John Gabriel Borkman is a
hard nut to crack: its tiresome characters simply lash at one another in expected ways and then it's over.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST</p>

Baby Bump With...This production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music  directed by James Macdonald certainly milks more
humor out of the play than one normally finds. When the son that embodies the hopes and desires of the
entire Borkman clan appears, he is ping-ponged between them to amusing effect at one point. "Comewith me!" pleads his mother, his aunt, and his father with increasingly frenzied need.
But that modest success means the pathos and pain is all the harder to summon in the scenes to come.
The set by Tom Pye works well for the indoor scenes: the stage is filled with mounds of snow, like a cold,
desolate and surreal desert strewn with a grandfather clock, chairs and other unexpected items. But when
the story mohttps://blogger.huffingtonpost.com/mt.cgi?__mode=view&_type=entry&blog_id=3#ves out
doors, suddenly those very same piles of snow seem as thuddingly obvious as the gusts of wind that
thunder in from offstage and the clanging sounds of doom.
Marty Rea is suitably hapless as the son they yearn to control and Cathy Belton is vampish as the
divorced woman who cynically woos him away. Duncan is a tad too languid as the sister who wants to
adopt the boy for her own though she sparks a bit when paired with Shaw. Rickman is the most adrift
here, with that sonorous voice leaving him stranded all alone making music that no one else can hear.
They amount to four different performances in four different productions, none of them quite ringing
true with the text. Only Shaw seems to be acting in the play that Ibsen wrote, her fierce bitternessslapping us awake at various moments.
Obviously, we'll see all these actors in better shows to come. But another production of John Gabriel
Borkman?  That prospect begins to freeze the heart almost as much as Ibsen intended his play to do.
What others are saying:
Ben Brantley of The New York Times  said, "I'm not so sure about the enduring power of "John Gabriel
Borkman," at least not on the basis of the emotionally unconvincing, erratically enjoyable
interpretation."
Elizabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post  gave it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars and said, "Visceral, stirring and
visually sumptuous."
Andy Probst of Theatermania  said, "And director James Macdonald's uneven new production, which
originated at Ireland's Abbey Theater, boasts two powerful and often frightening turns from British stars
Lindsay Duncan and Fiona Shaw. When the two actresses share the stage, the production not only sparks
with unexpected humor, but brilliantly catches fire."
David Sheward of Backstage  said, "Even in a production as exemplary as the Abbey Theatre's taut
rendition, which features a muscular new English version of the script by Frank McGuinness and high-
wattage performances from the stellar likes of Alan Rickman, Lindsay Duncan, and Fiona Shaw, therewere audience giggles at Ibsen's plot excesses. Plus the play concludes with a dragged-out denouement in
a blinding snowstorm. But director James Macdonald and his more-than-capable cast keep the soap
operatics to a minimum, emphasizing the white-hot passions amid the frozen landscape."
