7/30/2005 11:55:00 AMUSA Today has a very good editorial spelling out why the"death tax," aka a big fat tax break for the already super-wealthy, is absurd at any time, much less when we're fightingmassive deficits and the draining cost of war in Iraq. Somehighlights:Just 1% of estates paid any estate tax in 2003, accordingto the IRS. Three quarters of the money raised from the taxcomes from estates of more than $5 million....Of the more than 18,000 estates paying the tax last year,just 340 consist primarily of a single farm or smallbusiness....The Senate measure, which is still being negotiated, wouldtax inherited wealth of millions of dollars at a lower ratethan what a teacher pays on a $70,000 annual salary. Itwould also give inherited wealth a more privileged statusthan money made from hard work or putting capital atrisk....The measure would cost the treasury about $196 billionover the next decade. That would require othertaxpayers to make up the difference or add yet moredebt to be paid off by future generations.
