            <p>The controversial movie "Borat: CuI­
turalLeamings of America for Make 
Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakh­
stan," co-written by and starring British 
comic Sacha Baron Cohen (aka lV's 
Ali G), is a faux documentary , opening 
Friday, about a Kazakh lV reporter trav­
eling the U.S. to learn our ways (and he 
hopes, maybe many Pam Anderson) . 
The government of Kazakhstan has 
expressed concern about the fictional 
Borat (r.) '~representing'" its people. 
Some ac:tivist groups worry-that the mov­
Ie's button-pushing on race, gender and 
sexuality will be seen as encouraging, in­
stead of spoofing , prejudlce. And some 
of the people interviewed by Borat in the 
film say they didn't realize he was mak­
ing a comedy when they expressed or 
agreed with outrageous c·omments . 
But one thing isn't being discussed: 
Baron Cohen's goofball skill in a movie 
that industry bible Variety has already 
called "uproariously funny." 
Penn Jillette, of the comedy duo Penn 
& TeUer and one of the forces behind the 
documentary "The Aristocrats, " agrees. 
, All anyone is talking about are the 
things other people say in the film," says 
Jillette. ''What I think should be talk-
ed about, really, is what a fabulous actor 
Sacha is. I would watch 'Borat' without 
anyone being pranked in it.' The kick is the 
difficulty level in 
Baron Cohen'S 
performance. 
The improv in 
films like "Best 
in Show" or the , 
upcoming "For ~G 
Your Consider- . 
ation" comes from 
actors riffing togeth- '. 
er, in a standard mOviemaking ~--­
style. And the "Jackass" guys 
provoke a response with physical stunts. 
Baron Cohen's goal was to provoke a re­
sponse, be funny, stay in character and 
never lose the confidence of the peopJe he 
"interviewed. " And to do it all in one take. 
So while much of the movie's humor 
comes from Borat talking to frat boys. 
a rodeo official and experts on man­
ners (all of whom react with increduli­
ty or cheerful agreement to Borat's rant­
ings) , there is a whole other hlgb-wire 
act happening on screen -though JiI­
Jette thinks some people in the film may 
have caught on to the joke. 
"People love to put each other on in 
the U.S.," he says. "While they may have 
been trying to get along with Borat, 
they may also have just wanted to have 
a good time. r think it was America that 
may have taken Borat for a little ride." •</p>
