Michael Moore warns he may face jail over his new film
BY MICHAEL GILTZ
SPECIAL IO THE NEWS
CANNES, France - It was stand-
mg room only yesterday as
Michael Moore's film .,Sicko" in-
dicted the American health cae
system - md as he explained
why.he may face prison time for
netprng expose the shameful
treatment of 9/1 I heroes
The documentary, which criti_
cizes U.S. medical compmies as
greedy, shows ailing 9/ll re_
sponders getting better health
cme in Cuba than at home.
'nvhat htr become of us?.Moore asked, describing how 50
mrlon Amencans live wilh no
health coyerage
'lMhere is ou soul?',
Moore is threatened with oossi-
ble jail time by the feds for unau-
thorized travel to Cuba
. Conseruative American politi-
clans are more focused on
Moore's trip to the Communist
country than the urgent messaEe
his film del.ivers.
- The post-screening press con-
rerence concentrated on the irr
vestigation - and Moore was
clealy worried."I'm being personally investi-
gated, and I'm the one liable for
fines or jail," said the director,
who has to respond to the invesh-
gators by Tuesday.
The film, set for U S. release
June 29, shows Moore taking
three volunteers, who worked at
Ground Zero after the 9/ll at-
tacks, to Guantanamo Bay,
wnere- press reports say accused
terronsts are receiving excellent
meotcal care.
Moore said he has faith thar
Amencam will not hold his triD
to Cuba against him, as onL
right-wing New York newspaper
has, but instead will be outraged
at what he htr uncovered.
"I have faith in the American
people. They're not gong to focus
on Cuba," he said "They,re going
to say, 'The Al Qaeda-detalnees
are receiving better health care
than the 9/11 workers who went
to Ground Zero?"'
The film shows Moore, after
failing to enter the base, taking
the 9/ll workers, includingJohn
Graham, who defended Moore in
an interview with the Daily News
last week, to get Cuban medical
cile.
"Why would we let 50 million
Americans not have health imur-
ance, 9 million of them chil-
dren?" Moore asked 'tVe're the
United States! We can do betterr,'
The News has campaigned for
better care for sick first risoond-
ers. In a series of editorials.
which were honored with a pu-
lilzer Pize, The News revealed
the growing numbers of sick
New Yorkers and fought for. and
helped win, mo.e assGtance.Michael Moore
