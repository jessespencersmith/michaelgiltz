<p>EYES ON THE PRIZE  ($69.99; PBS)
JAZZ: A FILM BY KEN BURNS  ($99.99; PBS) -- Black History Month is useful and misleading. No
remotely decent history of the US could be told without the story of slavery, racism, respect and triumph
of black Americans interwoven throughout. But since it was ignored or downplayed for so long, perhaps
an annual reminder isn't so bad. On the plus side, it also encourages the availability of works like Eyes
On The Prize: America's Civil Rights Years  by the late Henry Hampton. A look at the struggle for basic
civil rights for black Americans from 1954-1965 seems like a slam dunk: how can you go wrong with
iconic events like Rosa Parks, the bombings in Birmingham, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign ofnon-violence and so much more? Easily. Plenty of boring dutiful essays and homework-likedocumentaries have been made about fascinating moments of history. Yet, even if you expect the best,you will be surprised by just how engrossing and accomplished this film is. They talk to everyone stillalive, from little children caught on camera at the time to movement leaders, from racist Southernsheriffs to privileged white kids from the North who joined the Freedom Riders. It's told in six clear,lucid, absorbing hours in a manner that presents an exceptionally complex tale with ease. Everyone isseen at their best and worst, without judgment -- the infighting among competing groups like the anxious
student groups that want action  and King's people who are strategizing how best to leverage publicity
into federal action. And no matter how much you think you know about the civil rights battle, it's jaw-
dropping to see the waves of violence, the angry mobs hurling epithets at little children trying to go toschool, the mass mobilization of national guards on one side and local and state police on the other.Anyone who thinks terrorism is some strange disease from foreign shores would do well to see thebeatings, bombings, killings and cowardly acts perpetrated on a wide scale throughout the South. Aboveall, this is entertaining, if one can use such a light term for such a serious battle. President WoodrowWilson once called the technically masterful but vilely racist film Birth Of A Nation  "history written in
lightning." It was more like lies written with smoke and mirrors. Eyes On The Prize  is real  history written
in lightning and then etched in stone -- a monument to an era and a fight that does it the highestcompliment of telling that story with honesty and insight.
Now I'm on to the Ken Burns documentary Jazz . He doesn't feel jazz in his bones the way he did with
baseball, so it's not quite as masterful. As always, Burns uses the topic at hand to look at the history of
America and especially race in America. It's a useful lens and whatever you think of this film's verytraditional, hidebound vision of jazz (with Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington as the gods, of course),you'll find a wealth of glorious footage and great tales. It ends for the most part in the early 1960s, with aquick run-through of the 40 most recent years leading up to the film's release. You could tell the story ofjazz a hundred different ways. This is just one, but it will certainly send any casual fan back to the music.

<p>IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY  ($39.98 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; Universal/Focus) --
Actually, it's not; it's kind of a sad story. In this case, it's the sad story of a writing/directing team -- Anna
Bowden and Ryan Fleck -- who started off strong and now seem lost. They broke through with HalfNelson,  a very conventional story about a drug-addicted school teacher enlivened mightily by an
astonishing performance by Ryan Gosling. It was one of the my favorite films of the year. That wasfollowed by Sugar , a more daring script about Dominican baseball players who come to the minor league
system hoping to break into the big time. I'm a big baseball fan, so I was primed to love the film, whichwas fresh when it stuck with observing the culture shock of these often poor young men who often don't
speak English and are suddenly plopped down in the middle of the heartland. Too bad it veered into
Hollywood territory and had to cast actors who could also play ball, limiting their pool mightily. Still, itwasn't your average bear. Now comes It's Kind Of A Funny Story,  which feels conventional and even
anonymous on every level. A suicidally depressed teen (handsome Keir Gilchrist) checks himself into thepsych ward of a hospital and must stay there for a week to be evaluated. The ward is packed with lovableeccentrics who either learn a life lesson from our hero or teach him one, especially Zach Galifianakis. Willour hero lure his bed-bound roommate out into the ward? Will he strike up a friendship/romance withthe only other teen around, who is happily both female and cute (a fine Emma Roberts)? Duh. Yes, themovie acknowledges the easy allure of such a rosy view on life at the finale, but that doesn't absolve it.Gilchrist may have talent, but here he's just a pleasant presence, hardly the life force that might shake
things up nor even a troubled, wounded soul that needs repairing. We are never convinced for a moment
that this verbal, likable, high-achieving kid would actually harm himself. That rather undercuts the entirefilm, don't you think?
WAITING FOR SUPERMAN  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular DVD; Paramount) -- It's pretty
remarkable that a documentary film could run in theaters for three months and gross nearly $7 millionand probably just as much again on DVD. And yet, in the post-Michael Moore era, this almost seemscommonplace. It's not but clearly documentary films are a genre people will happily go see in theatersand rent or buy on DVD. This one is the acclaimed look at our public school system. It focuses on charterschools as a key to the future and teacher unions as the big baddie blocking reform. Whatever themethod of getting students to achieve, the one factor that seems common in every reform -- no matter
how far-fetched or traditional -- is a passionate principal or leader. If you have that, anything is possible.

<p>THE TWILIGHT ZONE SEASON THREE ON BLURAY  ($99.98; Image) -- This is the crown jewel
in the Image library and they've treated it accordingly with the care and lavish attention it deserves. The
37 half hour episodes from season three look just stunning on BluRay. Pair this BluRay with a hi-def TVand you're surely seeing and hearing it better than its ever been seen before. The guest stars are top-notch, ranging from Carol Burnett to Robert Redford to a string of minor actors given the roles of alifetime. I always remember the episode where a neighborhood panics over a possible nuclear strike andfights each other bitterly to get into a fallout shelter. But this season also has classics like "It's A GoodLife" (with a small town terrorized by a little boy) and "To Serve Man" (the one-liner of a joke aboutaliens who come in peace) and many more. You get the copious extras from earlier sets and a ton of newextras like 19 more audio commentary tracks, interviews and -- my favorite -- 19 radio dramas as well.This is a TV classic presented in classic form.
YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER  ($38.96 BluRay or $28.95 regular DVD; Sony) -- Is it
worth seeing? No. At this stage, as mediocre film follows mediocre film and the bad outnumber the goodand threaten his reputation (which deserves to remain high, no matter how many bad films he makes), Ithink most fans just want to know if seeing the new Woody Allen movie will diminish him in their eyesjust a tad more or keep his integrity undimmed. This comedy is too innocuous to tip the scales eitherway, but if it isn't a net positive like Match Point,  why bother? Why cloud your memory of Annie Hall
and Manhattan  and Husbands & Wives  and Hannah And Her Sisters  and The Purple Rose Of Cairo  and
his other great works from the 70s and 80s with more of the same, only less? Tall Dark Strangercertainly won't surprise you in the least. Josh Brolin and Naomi Watts are an unhappily married couple;he's a frustrated novelist (one success, multiple failures) who has a wandering eye; she's an assistant inan art gallery whose sexy new boss (Antonio Banderas) isn't being nearly forward enough. AnthonyHopkins is her dad, saddling himself with a dim-witted prostitute turned girlfriend. (At least this timethe old man with the young gal looks foolish.) And her mom is the redoubtable Gemma Jones, whocomes off best as a woman sideswiped by her husband's abandonment but consoled by a fake psychic (isthat redundant?) who promises her that she's in a glow of triumph and all will work out well. Everyonedoes their job, a few moments sparkle (a little) and Freida Pinto (of Slumdog Millionaire ) as Brolin's
quite reasonable obsession is ready for a great Hollywood role. But it's telling that a director so identifiedwith one city doesn't even begin to capture London here. Clearly, shooting overseas woke Allen up out of

<p>his 90s stupor. But this film could be set in any major city without making the slightest difference and
the characters are equally cardboard. London should not feel like Barcelona or New York. It should feel
like London. So I don't come to bury Allen or to praise him but to shrug my shoulders and wish again
that Woody would stop making movies out of habit and start making them only when he feels truly
inspired. He certainly wasn't this time.
BASIL DEARDEN'S LONDON UNDERGROUND  ($59.95; Eclipse) -- Criterion's no-frills line
Eclipse continues to be a source of unexpected pleasures. This boxed set reveals director Basil Dearden as
a savvy examiner of London's overlooked. Sapphire  from 1959 was the real find for me. A young
woman's murder turns into a fascinating glimpse of blacks in the UK when she turns out to have been alight-skinned black woman who chose to "pass" for white. The investigator's sidekick proves racist in aninterestingly low-key manner while the rich and poor black people of London are seen in all theirdiversity and range, from thugs to the privileged, from those who disdained Sapphire's desire to pass to
those who won't condemn her. It's not a great film, but it's an intriguing one made with polish. The
League Of Gentlement  from 1960 wasn't nearly as fun as I hoped. It shows down on their (and
sometimes just plain shady) veterans of World War II brought together for an elaborate bank job, usingtheir skills from the military to pull it off. A bit larky but not larky enough, I'm afraid, though againDearden drops in some great tidbits, like the casual approach to a gay member of the team. Victim  is one
of Dearden's most famous films, of course, with Dirk Bogarde as a closeted gay lawyer risking everythingto take on a blackmailer who preys on the gay community. Very few films are made with such a socialpurpose in mind (this movies specifically hoped to overturn laws banning homosexuality). Almost noneof them are actually good. This one is. Finally, there's All Night Long  from 1962. I haven't watched it yet,
but a modern retelling of Othello set in a London nightclub featuring Charles Mingus and Dave Brubeck?Count me in.
THE TWILIGHT SAGA SOUNDTRACKS VOLUME 1  ($34.99 BluRay or $26.99 regular DVD;
Summit) -- The Twilight  movies have been pretty awful. In marked contrast, their soundtracks and use of
pop music have been excellent, providing a great cross-section of terrific current acts. This DVD is to myknowledge unique -- a collection of videos and live performances by the artists on the first three films.Has any other movie series done this before? It's only Volume One because of course there are two moresoundtracks to come and numerous songs didn't make the cut. Personal favorites here include The Magic</p>
<p>Numbers with Amadou & Mariam on "All I Believe In" and Muse's "Neutron Star Collision (Love Is
Forever)" and Bon Iver and St. Vincent's "Roslyn." I'm not quite sure why the footage from the moviesused in some of the videos is blurred out. That keeps this from being ideal for those who love the moviesand the music. But otherwise this is a very good collection of tunes. Bonus features include two classicalpieces used in the movie by Debussy and Verdi.
FOR COLORED GIRLS  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.95 regular DVD; Lionsgate)
TYLER PERRY'S HOUSE OF PAYNE VOLUME SIX  ($29.98; Lionsgate) -- For Colored Girls  was
probably doomed from the start. The landmark stage show is a plotless work by Ntozake Shange called a"choreo-poem." Clearly, we're not in standard play territory and what makes it special in the theater isthe very theatricality that makes it unsuited for film. Tyler Perry bravely hangs a thin tale on it andbrings together a stellar cast including Thandie Newton, Whoopi Goldberg, Anika Noni Rose, LorettaDevine, Janet Jackson and more. All to little avail. It's a shame there's no audio commentary; it would benice to hear Perry talking about this passion project that probably only he could get to make as a feature.
Far more middle of the road is the latest set of 24 episodes from the bland sitcom House Of Payne . It
remains more fascinating for the making and marketing than the show itself. After a wildly successful ten
episode trial run, the cable channel TBS ordered 100 episodes up front, immediately establishing it as ashow that would reach enough episodes to fruitfully syndicate it. This set goes up to episode 124 andthere are two more seasons to go. Amazing.</p>
<p>BAD DAY TO GO FISHING  ($24.95; Film Movement) -- The DVD of the Month Club series by Film
Movement  is the best way to find undiscovered gems that I know. Heck, I go to film festivals around the
world and they still deliver stuff I haven't heard of and find enjoyable. Last year, one of my favorite films
was Alamar , a movie I discovered thanks to Film Movement.  I'm sure 2011 will be no exception. Up this
month is a ramshackle comedy set in Uruguay about a strong-man who takes on all challengers in staged
wrestling matches held in tiny village after tiny village. I can't wait to check it out.
YOU AGAIN  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular DVD; Touchstone) 
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT  ($35.99 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; Warner Bros.) -- Betty White isn't
perfect. We know that now. But can we really blame her for saying yes to anything and everything in the
twilight of her career? No, of course not. But hopefully she has some good advice for Kristen Bell andJosh Duhamel. They are the respective stars of these two thoroughly bland comedies. Bell and Duhamel(which sounds like a law firm) add sparkle and zest, to a degree. But how many shots are they going toget at becoming stars before audiences move on? Please, someone, help them find some good scripts.
Betty, got any recommendations for building a 70 year career?</p>
<p>WUSA  ($24.95; Olive/Paramount) -- The specialty label Olive continues to plumb the Paramount
catalog with interesting results. Paul Newman stars in this 1970 drama about a shock jock who joins a
conservative lineup on a station in New Orleans, spewing out hate with the best of them. The fictioncomes in when he feels guilty about it, rather than laughing all the way to the bank. The excellent
supporting cast includes Cloris Leachman, Moses Gunn and Laurence Harvey and it's directed by Stuart
Rosenberg, the guy behind one of Newman's best -- Cool Hand Luke.
TOP GEAR SEASONS 14 AND 15  ($24.99 each on BluRay; BBC) - This highly entertaining series
about all things vehicular is wildly popular in the UK but hasn't caught on in the US yet. It should. I don't
give a toss for horsepower and can't tell the difference between a Camaro and a Camry, but thecombination of celebrities, silly stunts like driving a Toyota pickup in an active volcano and the like isdiverting fun. The recent brouhaha over an obnoxious series of jokes about Mexican cars wasn't funnyand should have been condemned instead of defended by the BBC, but it was quite atypical. (And the UScable channel BBC America was right to edit it out.) Buy it for the gearhead in your life and be surprised</p>
<p>at how much you enjoy watching it with them.
AMERICA AMERICA  ($19.98; Warner Bros.) -- The recent elaborate boxed set for director Elia Kazan
was well deserved. I didn't get to check it out, but then the only DVD I really wanted/needed was this
one. It's a 2 hour and 48 minute intimate epic about immigrants coming to America and making a newlife for themselves. It deserves pride of place alongside his better known classics but has beenovershadowed and forgotten in comparison to A Streetcar Named Desire, On The Waterfront, A Face InThe Crowd, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, East Of Eden  and more. Just listing those movies reminds you
what a crowded resume Kazan has, but this Oscar nominee for Best Picture really does deserve yourattention. Snap it up.
CLASSIC EDUCATIONAL SHORTS: SAFE NOT SORRY AND THE CELLULOID SALESMAN($19.95 each; Kino) -- Nope, they never get old. Pee-wee Herman uses old educational shorts (the sortthey'd show to students in the Fifties and Sixties when teachers wanted an easy break). They still makeaudiences laugh. These two sets are chock full of silliness like "Dangerous Stranger," "Safety: Harm Hides</p>
