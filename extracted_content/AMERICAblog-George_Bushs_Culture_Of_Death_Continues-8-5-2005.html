8/05/2005 02:33:00 AMThe world poured out its heart during the brief moment thetsunami captured our attention. But the slow-motion disasterof hunger -- which can be predicted months in advance --leaves us cold. Money spent early on could save a lot morelives a lot more cheaply. But Bush ignored the nightmare inNiger.International aid officials and charity workers here say thatthe world's dilatory reaction to Niger's woes is hard toexcuse. Some of them also say that Niger's miseries thisyear are merely a worsened version of its perennial ones -and that until Niger addresses its problems of primitivefarming, primitive health care and primitive socialconditions, infants will continue to die unnoticed in numbersthat dwarf any hunger emergency.......they are pushing the death rate for small children evenhigher than Niger's customary one-in-four level, and killingoff the livestock upon which the nation's nomads depend.How many people need aid depends on the yardstick used.About 1.2 million of Niger's 3.6 million rural farmers andherders are described as "extremely vulnerable" to foodshortages and in need of food aid, according to anassessment of Niger's crisis conducted four months ago bythe United Nations, major charities and Niger's government.Of those, about 874,000 urgently need free food, the latestassessment concluded late last month, and that numbercould rise until the harvest is completed in October....Among others, the United Nations World Food Program andDoctors Without Borders sounded alarms, and Niger'sgovernment, with World Food Program approval, quicklyasked donors to give Niger 71,000 tons of food aidand $3 million for the 400,000 most vulnerablefarmers and herders.By May, it had received fewer than 7,000 tons of foodand one $323,000 donation, from Luxembourg....The charity has angrily accused governments of allowingchildren to die, albeit not intentionally, so that the freemarket in grain would not be disrupted.Three million dollars could have made a crucial early difference.Three million dollars and some of the food we let rot in silos to propup prices and undercut other African farmers. That isn't even bigenough to qualify as an accounting error for the US. So big businesstrumps starving babies. And Bush does nothing. Some "culture oflife."
