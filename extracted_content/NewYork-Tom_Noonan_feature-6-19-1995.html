After Tom Noonan won the 
grand prize at last year's 
Sundance Film Festival for 
What Happened Was ••• --a dal1l­
Iy comic if claustrophobic look at a 
desperate would-be couple on their 
first date-financing his next pro­
ject should have been a breeze. 
But Noonan claims that when he 
began filming The Wife, "I bor­
rowed everything I could in the 
world and took all the money I'd 
saved, and we were able to shoot 
for one week." A French production company stepped in with funds at the last moment, allowing Noo­
nan to shoot the movie without compromising his funny but painfully observant stOI)'. Showing at Lin­
coln Center on June 15 at 6:30 (see "Museums, Societies, Etc." for info), the film tells of two the~ 
pists-one (Julie Hagerty) addicted to Quaaludes, the other (Noonan) with a vicious tongue and wa~ 
dering eye-who are confronted one evening by a deeply unhappy patient (Wallace Shawn) and his 
erratic, poorly educated wife (Noonan's real-life wife, Karen Young, pictured above). The two inter­
lopers end up staying for dinner ancl-as in Who's Afraid of Virginia WooH?~on't leave until their 
strained relationships are ruthlessly exposed. Perhaps best known for his unsettling!y sympathetic 
portrayal of a serial killer in Manhunter , Noonan clearly has no problem playing edgy people. Did he 
like his character, who treats Hagerty so nastily? "But she's a junkie," he laughs in defense. "I find 
him funny; I like that kind of mean humor." MICHAD. GILlZ</p>
