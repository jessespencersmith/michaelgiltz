'.. n the suspense film "88 Minutes," opening Friday, Al Pacino stars as a college professor
'' and part-time FBI forensic psychiatrist who receives a death thfeat claiming he has only 88
." minutes to live.
il Bad luck? l\4aybe not Pacin0's character might not survive, but movies with the number
"8" in their title are often a boon to the DeoDle who make them.
Eight is a lucky nurnber in Chinese culture - that's sihy the Olympic Games in Beijing
are scheduled to begin on Aug 8, 2008 * yep,8-8-08 - at 8:08:08 p.m. Tlte number is also
auspicious in Hollyvr'ood: 8 mm is a standard frlm format that doubles to 16 mm (the digits in 35
mm not surprisingly, add up to 8) Here are eight lucky "8" movies to pondel Michael ciltz

Tayror, by lhe way, wf,s married eight limes
,r\s 8 MILE (2OO2)
Roll of the die: Starring in a Hollywood
movie inspired by your own life is about the
uncoolest thing a hard'core rapper could do
But that's exactly the risk Eminem took with thrs
biopic about a white-trash kid looking to win a
local rap contest
Lucky eight His song "Lose Yourself" won
the Oscar for Best Song. lt was his eighth hit
single on Billboard's Hot 100 and by far the
biggest of his career. The lilm grossed $116
million in the U-S and $242 million worldwide
Now add up either of those numbers (1+1+6, for
example) and you get...8
\!\\ HARD ETGHT (1996)
Roll of the dice: Slruggiing writer-director
Paul Thomas Anderson crafted this quiet drama
about losers on the fringe ofthe gambling world
and cast his favorite actor, Philip Eaker Hall, as
the lead.
ludry â‚¬irJfit Anderson hated when the studio
changed the name to "Hard Eight," but it became
a criticJl oreaktnrough thaf led to "Boogie
Nights," "l/aqnolia," "Punch-Drunk Love" and
"There Will Be Blood " There are eight letters in
the last name of Anderson, "Boogie" star Mark
WJhlberg and "Blood's' Daniel Day Lewis
\ 48 HRS. (1982)
Roll of the dice: "Saturday Night Live"
breakout Eddie lvlurphy was teamed lvlth Nick
Nolte in a rough and tumble action flick that
Murphy enlivened with his quicksilver wit and a
hilarious rendition of "Roxanne" (the first hit for
the Police, whose eiglrth U.S. single was "Every
Breath You Take," whiclr was No 1 for eight
weeks).
Lucky eight: lvlurphy was such an immediate
sensation that by his eighth frlm, "Harlem
Nights," he took the reins and directed it
himself Murphy followed that with 'Another 48
Hrs." which grossed $80 milliontxc'|ry eigtt At the heart ot the scandal was
Joe lackson (played by D B Sweeney), who
was kicked out of the game despite batting
extremely well and not making a single error in
the fleld that series. His nickname "Shoeless"
has eight letters in it, and he began his pro
i career in 1908. According to the Bdeball Page
Web site, Jackson currently ranks as the eighth
: greatest leftfrelder otall time.
i s$ EIGHT BELOW (2006)
I Roll of the dice: In this superior live-action
I Disnev frlm, Paul Walker stars as an Antafctic
i scientist/explorer determined to rescue the
i eight sled dogs he is forced to leave behind by a
i vicious storm.
Lrdry eifit This was the eighth film Walker
made since his breakthrough in "The F6t md
The Furious" in 2001 Grossing just over $80 million
(okay, $81 million to be exact), it remains his only
substantial hit outside that action franchise
8 SECONDS (1994)
M of lhe de: After breaking oLt in "Beverly
Hills 90210," Luke Perry was dying to prove he
was leading mil material. The story of legendary
bull rider Lane Frost seemed the perfect vehicle,
complete with atragic early death
Lucktr eight: The movie barely lasted eight
seconds at the box ofice, but Perfy could lake
solace in decent reviews. His postr'90210"
career has not been bad, including stints on
HBO's "Oz'' and "John Frcm Cincinnati," so
clearly someone was watching lt could have
been worse- He could have been lan Ziering
-81/2 "(196s)
Roll ot the dice: Difector Federlco Fellini had
made a career out of belng wonderfully self-
;ldulgent, but would a movie about a tamous
director making a movie be going too far?
lacky eigftt Hardly "8 ti" became one of
Hollywood's greatest odes to itself, even if it was
made in ltalian lt scored two oscars and three
more nominations, a rare feai for a fofeign film
"8 72" has since lived on as thc stage musical
"Nine, wLrir\ itself is be ng made inLo J movie
starring Javier Bardem that comes out in 2009.
