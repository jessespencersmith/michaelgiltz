 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: Jesus Christ Superstar  Not
Divine, Regrets  Has a Few
JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR  * 1/2 out of ****
REGRETS  * 1/2 out of ****
JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR  * 1/2 out of ****
NEIL SIMON THEATRE
First things first: Jesus Christ Superstar  is not really a
rock musical. Composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber has
about as much affinity for rock and roll as Liberace. Thisproduction contains thudding, muffled orchestrations
that emphasize the anonymous nature of Lloyd Webber's
"pop" sound. He's much happier taking inspiration from Puccini than the Rolling Stones. (Or even from
the tango and other non-pop areas, as Evita  would soon prove.) The music direction and supervision is
by Rick Fox, but the blame lies with Lloyd Webber.
The show has been revived on Broadway twice before (once briefly in 1977 and again almost as briefly in
2000). On each revisit, the work seems less distinguished and the same is true here. This production
began in Canada and is helmed by Des McAnuff, who had such a success with The Who's Tommy .
Unfortunately, his magic is lacking here. It would take a miracle to keep this open for much longer than
the five months the show enjoyed the last time around.
Despite the title, the musical -- which began as a concept album -- really focuses on Judas. Rather than a
pure villain, it takes the revisionist approach to imagine Judas as confused by Jesus suddenly seeming toembrace divinity, worrying about the presence of women among his followers (a scandalous, radical act
for the time) and genuinely striving to keep Jesus from endangering his life. Their back and forth as
Judas struggles with what to do before making the fatal mistake of betrayal he immediately regrets is theengine that powers the show.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>Of course, any musical lives and dies by its songs and Lloyd Webber is always good for a few catchy
numbers. This time they are the brief "Hosanna," sung by the crowds when Jesus enters the city before
Passover; the three note riff of "Jesus Christ Superstar" (effective even in this context) and "I Don't Know
How To Love Him." But songs don't work if they're not sung well and this show commits the mortal sinof casting poor singers. That always seems unforgivable for a Broadway show, when New York is burstingwith so much talent.
Chilina Kennedy is not remotely up to the vocal or acting demands of Mary Magdalene, modest as they
are. Paul Nolan has a few effective moments as Jesus, especially his wrath at the moneychangers in the
temple, but is otherwise undistinguished in a role that is admittedly very passive and sedate. Tom Hewitt
actually commands attention as Pontius Pilate, turning "PIlate's Dream" into a quiet highlight and
creating genuine drama out of Pilate's desire to get Jesus to say something, anything that can help Pilate
spare him in "Pilate and Jesus." But up and down the line, virtually every other part large and small is
sung poorly by the ensemble.
The shining exception is Josh Young as Judas, who not only betrays Jesus but practically steals the show
out from under the Messiah. I'm tempted to call it a star turn by Young, but the material doesn't quite
justify that. Still, from the very first note, Young makes the most of Lloyd Webber's melodies and the
lyrics by Tim Rice, such as they are. Every moment he's on stage, you can look at Young and know what
Judas is thinking and feeling, his internal conflict and moments of grace. Looking sexy and confident in
an all-blue suit at the finale (despite having just hung himself), Young singlehandedly almost manages to
shake the show out of its dreariness. This is his Broadway debut but hopefully it won't be his last.
Other than Young, there's little to praise. The scenic design by Robert Brill is functional and
unsurprising. The costumes by Paul Tazewell are drab and -- for the "naughty" scene at Herod's -- just
silly. The lighting by Howell Binkley confuses glaring brightness with a glimpse of the divine. And thechoreography by Lisa Shriver leaves no impression.
Obviously, a better production of JCS  is possible, starting with a cast that can bring to life the not-very-
demanding songs. But it seems doubtful the show is worth the effort. Lloyd Webber would soon far
outpace this effort with Evita  and other works. What once seemed cheeky and modern (Herod's joke
about daring jesus to prove he's a God by walking across his swimming pool) now seem mild and tame.
Godspell  seemed hopelessly naive in comparison even at the time. But it has influenced the music of
Christian worship for generations and its revival makes the piece feel timeless , if not exactly earth-
shattering. This Jesus Christ Superstar  is stuck in the seventies.
It's true that audiences often give standing ovations at the drop of a hint but surely this show has aguaranteed one built in. When Jesus has died for your sins and the bright lights break out and theorchestra plays the triumphant "da-da-dum" of the title song and the actor playing Jesus strides in
blazing white to the front of the stage, you can't help but feel it would be churlish not to rise to your feet,
whatever you thought of the show. Besides, you never know -- He might be watching.
REGRETS  * 1/2 out of ****
MANHATTAN THEATRE CLUB AT NEW YORK CITY CENTERMatt Charman is clearly the hot young playwright in the UK. He's got a commission from the National
Theatre for a new work, he's writing a screenplay for the venerable film company Working Title and he's
developing a drama for the BBC. Let's hope they're all more promising than this thin play about a groupof men isolated at cabins in Nevada in 1954, waiting to establish residency so they can get a divorce.
It takes six weeks to stake that claim to residency, just enough time for men to bond over their travails,
reveal why their marriages collapsed, fight, bicker and have a sentimental goodbye. This is a perfectly
valid basic for a play, but Charman piles on the plot twists and buried secrets, confusing revelations with
drama. The new guy shows up but Caleb (Ansel Elgort) immediately sticks out like a sore thumb. Calebclaims he's 21 but he sure doesn't look it. And even if true, that's an awfully quick leap from the
honeymoon to despair.
The other guys almost can't believe it, but since they make a game out of figuring out the backstory of
newcomers, they don't have to believe it. Gruff, ex-military man Robert (Curt Bouril) imagines Caleb
killed a man and is hiding out. Timid pet store owner Alvin (Richard Topol) guesses that maybe Calebstole something. But the one-time school teacher Ben (a fine Brian Hutchinson in the show's best
performance) figures out something deeper and unexpected is at work and at the very least nails Caleb
over his age, forcing the kid to admit he's just 18 years old.

TV http://t.co/Ygqtb4U6  via
@HuffPostTV</p>
<p>Mrs. Duke (Adriane Lenox), the owner of the establishment, just wants the men to bother her as little as
possible and keep women out of their cabins. That brings her in sharp conflict with Chrissie (Alexis
Bledel), the local prostitute with a heart of gold that -- surprisingly -- doesn't take a shine to the
preternaturally handsome Caleb but sleeps with the besotted Robert and yearns for the stability of Ben.
Again, the basic material for drama is here, but Charman doesn't trust his characters enough to simply let
them come to life. He brings in the Red scare, Hollywood, abusive fathers, suicide and more in revelation
after revelation to spice up the events. None of it is terribly convincing.
The cast is by and large capable, though Lenox is saddled with a cliched, truth-telling black woman. She
drives two white men to their cabins from the bus station and later says she could already see death inthe eyes of one of them. Because, you know, black women are always in tune with the supernatural.
The two unfortunate exceptions are Bledel and Elgort. Bledel is a charmer on TV and has proven Gilmore
Girls  was not a fluke with movies like Tuck Everlasting . However, in her New York stage debut, she
clearly doesn't have her theater legs yet and needs voice work to allow her to project the wonderfullynatural and quirky delivery she's capable of in a live setting.
Even less successful is Elgort, making his professional acting debut. Typically, young actors can shine in
roles that reflect who they are in real life, at least to a degree. But the complicated backstory of Caleb
(married, in love, fleeing the Feds) is far afield from the experience of any teenager. Elgort simply doesn'thave the tools to tackle this part and struggles to look comfortable onstage, despite his background in
professional ballet. Director Carolyn Cantor was simply wrong to cast him. The play is flawed but
certainly might have been presented better with a more experienced lead.
In a rare show of restraint, Alvin talks repeatedly about getting up the gumption to start playing his
clarinet again. I would have bet money we'd end a scene or the show with Alvin breaking out into a
glorious tune. Instead we hear him practicing roughly and sketching out rather nicely but tentatively asong at one point. It's believable and true, something Charman would do well to focus on in the future.

The emperor has no clothes and yet the subject matter makes most polite people refrain from
stating the obvious.   The story has to have a Lucifer, a Judas because he is the only interesting
personality.   Perfect is not personality.

Never saw the play but the movie was awesome. That guy who played Judas was off the charts.

Tim Rice is the worst lyricist in the business. I can't imagine how he gained his reputation.

I'm not so thrilled with Lloyd-Webber either. I think they're both incredibly over-rated.

Poorly executed revivals can ruin the reputation of a show. I have been lucky enough to see "Cats"
(BW), "Phantom" (London), and "Chess" (London), loved them, won't see them again because theywere good. I wish I could find a good production of "Rent" because I hear it was good, the ones I've
seen have been blah.
09:19 AM on 03/29/2012
Yep. 
We have to admit that Jesus Christ Superstar -- as a thing, as an entity -- simply isn't good enough
to sustain a full night in the theater or to merit the absurdly high price of admission, no matter who'sproducing it or starring in it. We survivors of the '70s should simply say of it, "Well, I guess you hadto be there," and move on.
And it isn't just that the melodies are, with a few exceptions, mediocre (which can be said for every
Lloyd Weber score I've ever heard). It's also that the libretto/lyrics are technically clumsy and
emotionally feeble-mined. Tim Rice is, and has always been, a hack. That a man with nearly no
talent at all could succeed so spectacularly never ceases to amaze me.
10:27 PM on 03/29/2012
Wow,I was thinking almost the exact same thing but must admit I still have a soft spot forthe movie .
