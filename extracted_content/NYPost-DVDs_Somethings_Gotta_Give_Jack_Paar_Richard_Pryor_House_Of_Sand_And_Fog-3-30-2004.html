Jack Nicholson ami Diane Keaton in a scena from "Some­
thing's Gotta Give." 
"SOMETHING'S GUITA mVE'! 
This romantic comedy ($28.95, Columbia TriStarl earned 
more substance and charm than it really deserves thanks to 
old pros Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. The extras in­
clude Nicholson unwisely crooning "La Vie En Rose," in a 
deleted scene, and multiple commentaries. Amid all the 
hoopla over the stars, one performarlce was overlooked -
Keanu Reeves as the boy-toy gave his most charming per­
formance since the stoner glory days of "Bill & Ted." 
liTHE JACK PUR COLLECTION" 
''THE RICHARD PRYOR SHOW" 
For those who weren't there, "The Jack Paar Collection" 
($29.99, Shout) featurES a very good retrospective, numerous 
interview and monologue highiights, as well as three COlTI­
plete shows from talk-show pioneer Paar, who hosted the 
"Tonight Show" starting in 1957. Only four episodes of Rich­
ard Pryor's 1977 show aired -NBC was freaked out by skits 
like "£1 Neggro" -but he paved the way for "In Living 
Color," "Chapelle's Show" and "South Park." Prior'S set 
($39.99, Image) includes all four episodes and a TV special, 
as well as outtakes md a Pryor QiXA. 
This over-praised melodrama (S26.99, Drea.'TIWorks) does 
have one saving grace -the acting. Ben Kingsley is marvel­
ous as an Iranian aristocrat fallen on hard times in Alnedca; 
Shohreh Aghdashioo has the role of a lifetime as his wife; 
Ron Eldard of "ER"; and Jennif" .. Connelly proves her 
Oscar was no fluke. 
liTHE LAST ROUND: ClUJVALO VS. AUI! 
"SPLiT DECISION" 
A feast for boxing fans, with "The Last Round" telling the 
Rocky-like saga of Canadian journeyman George Chuvalo, 
who stumbled into a shot at the heavyweight crown and took 
Muhammad Ali the distance ($24.95, DocuRamal. "Split De­
cision" ($29.95, First Run) tells the tortuous immigrant tale 
of Jesus Chavez, who struggles to succeed in boxing but 
also struggles with being deported back to Mexico for a 
crime he committed in his youth. 
An early Western and one of the first shows filmed in 
color, "The Cisco Kid" ($49.98, MPI); the cop show, "Hom­
icide: Life on the Street": Season 4 ($99.95, A&E); the junk­
