 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyMovies: NYFF #3 -- Blame It On The
Bossa Nova!
The New York Film Festival  is in full swing. Three new
films are documentaries of one sort or another,
exploring the masterpiece of novelist W.G. Sebald, the
uprising in Egypt and the music of legendary Braziliancomposer and performer Antonio Carlos Jobim. None of
them are wholly successful, but they should all appeal to
people with a particular interest in the topics at hand.
PATIENCE (AFTER SEBALD) ** out of ****
Author W.G. Sebald was one of the most intriguing and
original authors in the world when a heart attack while
driving in 2001 ended his life at the age of 57. He wasoften cited as a likely winner of the Nobel Prize for
Literature and was that rare writer with a truly distinctive voice. Not since Milan Kundera had a writer
appeared to create a radically new style of book. When his classic novel The Rings Of Saturn  was
published in 1995, it marked the third in a trilogy that included Vertigo  and The Emigrants . Like the
others, it's a curiously bracing and exciting mix of fiction, travelogue, history, memoir, and just about anyother label you can imagine. When asked what category he wanted it filed under in the bookstores,
Sebald said all of them.
He wasn't translated into English until 1996, but back in 1992 (when The Emigrants  was coming out in
German), British director Patrick Keiller was filming the movie London . Released in 1994, it's a
remarkably similar affair to Sebald: part documentary; part fiction; part bracing combination of reality,
memoir and imagination that's narrated beautifully by Paul Scofield. For years I tried to describe it to

<p>people and simply said in exasperation, "You just have to see it." Then I read The Rings Of Saturn  and
realized, my god, this is like the novelistic equivalent of London , a movie I considered sui generis. And
the books came first! Now when I want to describe the movie, I say, it's sort of like the books of W.G.
Sebald. And when I want to describe the books of W. G. Sebald, I say, it's sort of like the movie London .
Since most people have read and seen neither, that doesn't really help but at least I don't fumble around
anymore.
As you can imagine, Sebald has passionate fans. His novel The Rings Of Saturn  is perhaps first among
equals or at least the most relatively accessible. A contemporary classic, it tells of Sebald the narrator
taking a walking tour in parts of England, always ready to dash off a mini-essay on the childhood ofJoseph Conrad or the remarkably significant role of the silkworm in world history. Blurry photographsdot the text and if you think a description of a rambling estate and its odd story seems too good to be
true, just go online and it will show that Sebald is essentially accurate in his entertaining historical
diversions. It's moving, strange, weird, hypnotic and quite wonderful.
Patience (After Sebald)  is a tribute to all that. It's not a film like London  and it doesn't try to adapt the
novel, which would seem as impossible as turning The Unbearable Lightness of Being  into a movie (and
yet, that film was a classic in its own right). Instead it's an awkward, murky hybrid. The film travels to
some of the spots Sebald's book ventures to in its walking tour, but then immediately assures us that
trying to trace that path is fruitless and frustrating. Voice-overs offer chunks of the book at random.
Much of the time is spent talking to artists who love the book and venture tentatively but with deeprespect to explain why. Their grappling with it is amusing and bizarre. The sanest person made a "lit-
map," using GoogleEarth to pinpoint all the locations the book hits upon and including text from the
novel itself in this art piece. Others are far, far more convoluted and confusing.
If you haven't read Sebald, I imagine you'd leave the film wondering exactly what the heck this Sebald
guy had written. The film muddies the issue even though it spends most of its time trying to describe it,or rather explaining how difficult it is to describe it. I fear anyone not already a fan will have littlepatience indeed with the movie and those that do love Sebald won't exactly be enlightened. Best you read
the book on your own.
TAHRIR: LIBERATION SQUARE  **
Filmmaker Stefano Savona was on the scene for the Egyptian uprising very early on. He won the trust of
people risking their lives (and the lives of their families and friends) to overthrow a brutal dictator and
filmed throughout the entire remarkable series of triumphs, setbacks and ultimate victory. (Or rather, the
signal victory of deposing Hosni Mubarak; establishing a vital democracy is a work in progress.)
It's an exciting prospect that the film ultimately doesn't fulfill. They're in the midst of many of the major
moments, even getting on stage or near top officials for key speeches. But we know very little about theyoung people we're watching argue and debate and hold fast while events spiral out of control. At the end
of the movie, they're almost as much a mystery as they were at the beginning. Also, the filmmaker clearly
found a warm welcome among those pushing for a secular democracy. The splintering MuslimBrotherhood and its offshoots are shadowy presences that we gain no clear understanding of at any point.

<p>Tahrir  has a certain visceral jolt at times as we see the people reacting to events we saw transpire from
afar on CNN. It's moving to see them risk so much with so little hope of success and actually succeed. But
it definitely helps to be somewhat informed of what was going on at the time. Anyone who didn't follow it
will leave the movie having only the vaguest idea of what they were protesting, what was happening fromday to day and why it ended so well. In the movie, we get harried and confusing reports of attacks and
events on the other side of the square. If you watched CNN, you might know about thugs paid by
Mubarak's corrupt government to create havoc and foment violence. From the movie, it seems womenare front and center throughout. From CNN and other news reports, you learn the ebb and flow of theirtreatment -- early on women were a vital presence; later they were harassed by some and told they had
no business being there and why weren't they properly dressed?
So Tahrir  has a genuine immediacy and clearly the filmmakers put themselves at risk with the people in
the square to make this movie happen. It's passionate and gives a sense of what it must have been like to
sit there and not quite know what was going on but be convinced you had to stand fast. For any sort of
perspective or coherent story, however, you'll have to go elsewhere.
MUSIC ACCORDING TO TOM JOBIM  ** 1/2
Here's an almost foolproof idea for a movie that's rather bungled in its execution. Antonio Carlos Jobim
is one of the all-time great composers and a key figure behind bossa nova. His music has been covered byso many world-class artists in so many different settings that the director Nelson Pereira dos Santos said,why bother with lengthy biographical information and tributes by others? Let's just gather as many film
and concert and video clips that we can of the best artists in the world singing Jobim's music and cut
them together into one glorious film. Wonderful!
The movie gets off to a strong start, combining concert footage with scenes of life in Brazil to show the
world Jobim came from. Soon we glimpse scenes of carnival and Black Orpheus,  the movie that sent
bossa nova into the stratosphere for many people around the world. Soon enough there was "The Girlfrom Ipanema" -- one of the most recorded songs of all time -- and the rest is history. We see artists like
Gal Costa and Ella Fitzgerald and Elis Regina and Judy Garland and Dizzy Gillespie and Caetano Veloso
and on and on and on all delivering his many classics with verve and style. We also hear bits of hissymphonies and art song ventures, though the movie always returns to the songs that have become
standards.
So what's the problem? First, almost no songs are heard in their entirety, or to be more exact we almost
never get to hear one artist cover a song from beginning to end. (It does happen once or maybe twice but
this is clearly the exception.) That works great for "The Girl From Ipanema." At the center of the film thatsong is turned into a mega-medley with a fast version dissolving into a slow version into a version sung inEnglish into a jazz instrumental into a (happily brief) contemporary dance pop version) and on. That
showcase deftly demonstrates what a popular song it is and how a standard can be adapted brilliantly
into so many styles.
Unfortunately, to a lesser degree that's how every single song is treated. Judy Garland may be breaking
your heart but you can be certain we'll cut away from her to another version. Great performance afterperformance is cut short so they can move onto another one. But a third of three great performances
most assuredly does not add up to one great musical moment. All three are ultimately lessened. Music
According to Jobim  becomes 90 minutes of teasing.
By the end, the movie reaches for a grand finale by drawing from performances at all-star tributeconcerts. Seeing a glittering array of stars on stage certainly makes clear how cherished Jobim hadbecome by the end of his life. But group sing-alongs are rarely interesting musically so the movie
climaxes with some of the least interesting clips. I may not be right, but I also think Stan Getz wasn't
included; maybe no good film footage was available but that's a shame as well, though of course manyother acts couldn't be fit in either.
A movie that let the songs breathe, that chose certain performances and let them play out would have
been much, much more satisfying. It can't help but send filmgoers out to their local record stores tocheck out some of the marvelous music heard in the movie. But it should have been a satisfying musical

one of the best albums of his career (if not indeed the  best) when they recorded 1967's Francis Albert
