THE GRAND PARADISE  *** out of ****
OUR MOTHER'S BRIEF AFFAIR  * 1/2 out of ****
THE GRAND PARADISE  *** out of ****
THE GRAND PARADISE IN BROOKLYN
Great art is usually immersive. If I open a novel by Charles Dickens, I can
soon forget my surroundings entirely. A transporting album like Pink Moonby Nick Drake creates its own dusky, late night reality. Walk out of thecinema after seeing Kieslowski's Red  and you'll blink in the sunlight,
feeling shaken and spotting connections between yourself and strangersfor the rest of the day. In theater, the immersive trend is surely the latestiteration of "site specific" and other spins on the classic "sit in your seatand watch a show" performance of drama. It's gone from novelty to
tiresome trend to regular staple, a choice that is no more or less
promising than any other.
Punchdrunk has set the standard, triumphing here in NYC with Sleep No
More  but achieving a string of notable works in London and around the
world. Third Rail staked a claim to similar territory by resetting Alice In
Wonderland  in an insane asylum for Then She Fell.  Now they're
transporting people to the 1970s and a tropical resort a la Fantasy Island,a sexual paradise where visitors can be drawn out of their shells,transformed and return home a new person...assuming they return at all.
I missed Then She Fell,  unfortunately. Highly praised, it's still running in
New York City and is now joined by The Grand Paradise.  This too is
created by the threesome of Zach Morris, Tom Pearson & Jennine Willett,
the artistic directors of the company who directed, designed, wrote andTheater: Almost 'Paradise;' Awkward 'Affair'</p>
<p>choreographed it in collaboration with their company. They have rotating
cast and "staff" and shows like this are designed to contain more plot
and experiences than one person can see in one night.
A cursory description makes the show sound like a teasing, sexual romp,
a bacchanal of bawdiness. The audience is "flown" to a resort and
brought into a main area where they're given leis and welcomed by a
smiling, attractive staff that moves in a dreamlike manner and feelsvaguely cultish. That's not quite right, since the show notably does not tryand exude danger or (too much) dislocation. Mixed in with the audience
are some other tourists clutching luggage, mainly a family including a
husband, wife, two daughters and the older daughter's boyfriend. Theynotably don't get leis so that seems a clue as to who is in the audienceand who is performing, though the show will shift the rules as things go
along.
Practically the moment their luggage is whisked away, the wife is
beguiled by a female singer, climbing up to another level and changingclothes with this figure, assuming a new identity and leaving her familybehind without a backward glance. (I kept peeking, but the husband
didn't seem particularly surprised.) Numerous storylines spread out: the
wife of course is eager to be transformed, the husband is confused andtempted and ultimately "baptized" into a new and purer version of himselfand all the young people explore their sexuality, with their choices making
a good argument for genetic predisposition.
The Grand Paradise  contains various one-off scenes where groups from
the audience or individuals are taken into private areas for palm readings,
discussions of time, neck massages and the like. Meanwhile, the various
explorations of the family and staff take place around us, with audiencemembers frequently standing along the walls or peeking in around
corners or through windows as characters fight, tease, flirt, dance and
more. It sounds like a libidinous free for all, but wisely, it's not.</p>

In ways large and small, The Grand Paradise  explores sexual identity and
the freedom of the 1970s without trying to be "naughty" or sexy-sexy.
Voyeurism is not really the point, at least not in the sense of titillation.What the show is really going for is intimacy. To an unusual degree, the
actors in the show touch, hold, dance with and otherwise make contact
with the audience. They do it respectfully and never erotically (well, atleast not with me; I can't speak for the younger, prettier audiencemembers). The result is a sweet, rather innocent vibe that permeates the
show and makes the more hippie-ish moments in private go down easily.
My guest followed the plot-line of the younger daughter (Kate
Ladenheim), who is rather unwillingly tempted into various modes of
seduction, finally claiming her own identity on the Kinsey scale leaning
towards women. He was engaged by her performance, even as the storywas broken up by scenes of the father, mother and other vignettes.
I stuck mostly to the story of the Boyfriend, played and danced beautifully
by Jeff Sykes. As with Sleep No More  and other similar shows, when I find
an actor or storyline that intrigues me, I try to stick with it or come back to
it when possible. I'm sure the cast dubs audience members like me
"stalkers," though hopefully they find it a compliment for giving a goodperformance.
Most of the plot is told through dance, with virtually no dialogue used to
push the main stories forward. And dance is unquestionably the show'sstrong suit. Sykes' character was consistently manhandled by the men
and women around him in choreographed numbers, a young, confused
person with the sense of being tugged this way and that by desire andinterest embodied by a literal tug of war amongst the rest with him as the
rope. The Boyfriend had a sweet scene of innocent romance with his</p>
<p>girlfriend, but their sexual experience wasn't remotely satisfying for either.
(Maybe having a dozen people peeking in the windows of their bungalow
didn't help.)
Soon he's tentatively looking at the staff, all of whom are looking back, far
less tentatively. They toss him back and forth with abandon, with the
boyfriend looking alternately confused, freaked out and excited by the
attention. Women and men flirt, but it's clearly one staffer -- the Hustler--that intrigued the most. The Hustler is played by Zach McNally with a 70s
'stache and a wicked gleam, the sort of person who breaks hearts and
enjoys it. An arm wrestling match between the two turns into a fight, withthe man slapping him on the ass when the Boyfriend tries to leave,confusing our hero even more.
Again and again, Sykes would register conflicting emotions. The
Boyfriend grew from a shy person barely making eye contact with anyone
to peeking at the staff (and audience members) to eventually getting
bolder and bolder and registering our attention more directly. He didn'ttransform into a Lothario; he just discovered the power of acting on hisdesire to at least look  at the person he wanted to look at. When a far more
satisfying moment of physical pleasure loomed, the Boyfriend and theHustler retreated to the bungalow and slowly closed the blinds, shuttingout the prying eyes of the audience.
My guest tracked a different but similar sensibility in the Younger Sister's
story. Sexual identity and the abandon of the seventies was the subjectoverall. But they never tried to create the obvious aura of freewheeling
eroticism, just a sense of possibilities opening up and the genuine risks
that entailed. This was not a drug-fueled odyssey. The evening workedand the dance numbers were the reason why. They subtly echoed the
era's dance moves without becoming kitsch, propelling the story forward
at most every turn.
What worked less well was the production design at the smaller, more
detailed level. Punchdrunk raised the bar so high with Sleep No More  that
you simply can't get away with tossing in a few random objects and call itset dressing. The costumes and general atmosphere were effective(thanks especially to the score and effective sound design of Sean
Hagerty, which worked well despite having to deal with leaking into varied
rooms where different scenes were taking place.
Better to have no props at all than to toss some old photos here, some
coins there and so on. If you see an old phone sitting on a shelf in a
waiting area, one can't help being disappointed when there's no audioafter you pick it up; why not glue it to the phone or have the cord dangle
loose or even better create some interesting audio to play on a loop?</p>
<p>Short videos teasingly hidden behind a panel or two proved uninteresting
when given a closer look. An open chest might have an old camera or
other bric a brac in it, but so what? Certain rooms, like the one filled with
hourglasses were more effective since they set a stage, but even thereone might have been overwhelmed  with hourglasses. Instead the shelves
looked a little barer than one might hope for (though I did like the
hourglass with sand dyed blue). It seemed a lack rather than a choice and
the overall effect of these minor details was to make the experience seemless "real" than it would have if they'd had no open chest, no videos, andno phone at all.
Dance is clearly this company's strong suit, at least in this show. Self-
contained scenes were less successful textually, but none were bad, acredit to the actors who delivered them. I really liked a simple buteffective "light show" in which Jett (Mayte Natalio) played off our
astrology signs to tell a story with a bottle of water, a bowl with metallic
tiles and a small light. Natalio was a sexy but reserved presence, creating
an intriguing distance throughout the night. And I certainly enjoyed my
private pillow fight with the Hustler, who laughed when I suggested hehad a good chance with the new kid. Even here, it would have beeninteresting to see them push their wordless storytelling even further; many
of these experiences might have been more mysterious and effective
without the monologues even the authors tried to downplay bysuggesting it was pretty "New Age" stuff.
If I mention the nudity, you might again think naughty thoughts. While the
actors are certainly beautiful, that's not what they accomplish. Cheapthrills are easy. Here the wife strips down to her underwear just to
assume a new identity. The husband disrobes so he can dive into a pool
and be reborn, donning all white clothes to symbolize his new purity. Andthe Boyfriend who is alone outside of a room, wants to do nothing morethan knock on the door and say "hi." When he takes off his clothes, it
feels like a natural expression of the vulnerability one feels in any new
relationship. A lesser show would have had the object of desire abruptlycome outside and see him or have yet another character stumble upon
him for a scene of embarrassment or sexy surprise. But he is alone and
remains alone. The Boyfriend slowly puts his clothes back on, havingshown himself and us that he's ready to bare himself in every way. TheGrand Paradise  might have been a boring romp, an exercise in cheesy
references or a parade of silly clothes. Instead, at its best, it shows thatwhatever era you're living in, moments of true intimacy are rare andprecious and best appreciated quietly, one on one, with the curtains
drawn.
OUR MOTHER'S BRIEF AFFAIR  * 1/2 out of ****</p>
<p>MANHATTAN THEATRE CLUB AT SAMUEL J. FRIEDMAN THEATRE
If this were a better play, I'd start by talking about Richard Greenberg. His
recent successes include Tony nominations for The Assembled Parties(which others liked more than I) and acclaim for the musical Far FromHeaven.  Yet still, we return again and again to naming first and foremost
his unquestioned earlier triumphs with Take Me Out  and Eastern Standard.
That order of importance is not going to change with the addition of OurMother's Brief Affair .
And so we start with Linda Lavin, a terrific stage actress with a Tony anda clutch of nominations for roles in everything from Neil Simon's
Broadway Bound  to The Tale Of The Allergist's Wife.  Her dance card on the
stage, TV and film is always full but still I feel like she deserves more if
only because she's so good. (And while Alice  made her fortune, I still wish
she stuck with Barney Miller;  it never recovered from losing her.)
Any energy, any snap to be found comes from Lavin. She plays Anna, ademanding mother who is slowly dying and now, finally, shares someintimate details of her life with her two children. To confess? To prove her
life meant something? To entertain a mind drifting in and out of sanity by
making up a tale of infidelity? We'll never know.
What we do know is that intimate details are something almost no child
wants to hear. Yet her son Seth (the appealing Greg Keller) and daughter
Abby (Kate Arrington) can't help themselves. Abby hates labels butapparently both she and her brother are gay; this being a New Yorkmother, that's not as big an issue as which one will pay her enough
attention. So out comes the story of her brief but notable affair with Abe
(played by John Procaccino). Mom also has a secret, a burden she's
never told anyone and never will (though of course, she will).
It's all delivered in such familiar detail, from the forced music lessons for
the Jewish boy to the lover who is so different from her husband to thesitcom-zippy humor that you wonder what if anything of interest could be
on tap. Then Greenberg drops his bombshell, an end of act one
revelation as to the identity of her lover; the show never recovers, not thatthere was much to recover from.</p>
<p>Rather amusingly, Greenberg has to immediately explain who this once
infamous historical figure is: for Jews of a certain age, the betrayer of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg (namely, her brother David Greenglass) is aname of infamy, as hated and notorious as Jack the Ripper. The showliterally screeches to a halt to the sound of a needle scratching an LP
when the two children step out towards the apron of the stage and in a
witty aside, explain to everyone under 50 exactly who David Greenglassis and why we should care. They explain how his testimony sent them to
the electric chair, which unfortunately needs the additional historical note
that in fact we now know Julius was indeed guilty of the crime charged, acaveat that undercuts the righteousness a tad. Still, for most AmericanJews of Anna's era, Greenglass would be a figure of hate, a man
assumed to be weighed down by the guilt of betraying those two to save
his own skin (and that of his wife). He was spat upon, despised andeventually moved and changed his name, always expecting to be
rejected whenever he revealed his true identity. This aside is the liveliest
five minutes of the show and nothing before or after feels as fresh as thatfootnote.
Oddly, Greenberg explains exactly who Greenglass is and why he would
be dripping with self-loathing and shame. And yet, the actual characterhe wrote seems pretty indifferent, telling Lavin's Anna what he did andwhy and not sounding particularly burdened, truth be told. He certainly
doesn't feel like an historical figure of even minor note and his need for
forgiveness doesn't feel bone deep. It's as if you tossed in Elie Wiesel andthen couldn't really have him express any insight into the Holocaust.
Maybe this is because Anna never actually met the real Greenglass? After
all, the show toys with the idea that she has dementia and is making it allup or at least the part about who he was. The problem is that we don't
care one way or another. Anna has her own shame and one she divulges
in a monologue that's muddled and confusing, even if we can tacitlyrecognize why she'd feel bad about her brief thoughtless action long ago.The fact that her betrayal pales in comparison to what he did simply
muddies the waters even more.
In a show this diffuse, this uncertain as to what it wants to say, everything
remains fuzzy, from the direction of Lyne Meadow to the lighting and</p>
<p>costumes. The actors never exactly stumbled or dried up on their lines,
but even seeing it after the show had opened, they felt tentative. When
the story doesn't ring true, it can be awfully hard to remember your lines
and even harder to bring them to life.
This extends to all the tech elements, especially Santo Loquasto's
indifferent set design. Tall panels sort of seem to break the stage up into
three sections from front to back, with the section nearest the audience
playing the role of park bench or home or hospital room. Lavin would bestanding on one side but then slump into a chair, which somehow wasmeant to double as her hospital bed. None of it left any impression. Why
there were two other sections and what they were meant for, I don't
know.
Tossing in such a loaded figure as Greenglass into a domestic drama tilts
the play out of whack, whether Greenglass was ever there in the firstplace or not. Procaccino is vague from start to finish, no surprise given
his character's uncertain nature, while Arrington's daughter feels equally
indistinct. Keller benefits from having the most time onstage with Lavin,but even there it's the actor's winning personality that anchors us ratherthan anything about this particular role.
Even Lavin is not enough in these circumstances. She jumps decades in
age with ease. She delivers modest jokes with vinegar and topspin togive them the semblance of life. She commands the stage. But an artist
needs material to work with and here she has precious little.
