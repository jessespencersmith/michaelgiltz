            <p>M O N D AY,  D E C E M B E R  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6Evil Bunny Strikes Again"Postcards From Buster" is back on the air. The evil bunny Buster --who has been spreading his malicious gospel of tolerance and diversityand respect for other people and cultures -- was at the center of amaelstrom when a child with two mommys was briefly seen on camerawithout the appropriate denunciation. Now a new season has begunand Buster hasn't stopped proselytizing: he's visiting an Army post,taking kids across the border to Mexico to meet their pen pals (andfuture illegal immigrants, no doubt!), and even revisiting kids they metin the first season because their homes were destroyed by Katrina.Where's the HUAC when you need it? By the way, darned if I can findthe article now, but according to gov't statistics reported (I think inUSA Today) some 75% of children are raised in non-traditionalfamilies. A "traditional" family is when the biological mom and dad livetogether and raise the kids. I have three brothers and sisters with kids-- all of them are divorced, one is a single mom (with a great job andliving in one of the ritziest zip codes in the country), one is remarriedwith her two kids joining her new husband and one is remarried with ablended family of his two kids and her kid all sharing a home. Mindyou, all the kids also spend time with their other biological as well. Sowhat's traditional anymore?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

I wish I could reach into the TV and punchBuster in the face. Though his college age bunny sister is kinda hot.2:24 PM
