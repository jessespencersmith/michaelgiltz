5/18/2005 07:50:00 PMIsn't the New York Times (and perhaps the rest of the media)failing to accurately report what happened? Newsweek has notstated that abuse of the Koran did not occur by US militaryforces. What its very carefully worded retraction said was thatit was retracting the claim that "an internal militaryinvestigation had uncovered Koran abuse at Guantanamo Bay."That's very different from the headline the NYT is using:"Newsweek Retracts Account of Koran Abuse By US Military."One says they couldn't back up the claim that an internalinvestigation had made the abuse official. The other one saysno abuse occurred I can see the White House trying to smudgethe difference. But shouldn't the rest of the media be aware ofwhat Newsweek actually did and report it more accurately?
