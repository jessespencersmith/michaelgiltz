The success of 
last year's Go 
Fish-a low­
budget black-and-white 
comedy about frisky 
young lesbians that 
grossed an impressive 
$2,OOO,OOO-plus-has 
prompted a virtual glut 
of similar independent t 
features_ And unlike Whoopi Goldberg's much-hyped character in the re­
cent Boys on the Side, these women actually get to kiss onscreen and 
everything. In Only the Brave (above I-a sort of distaff Rebel Without a 
Cause screening at New DirectorslNew Films next week-one of the fe­
male teens gets intimate with a shy teacher from her school. In Bar Girls 
(opening in April), the protagonists pair off in enough dizzying combina­
tions to require a scorecard. And in The Incredibly True Adventures of Two 
Girls in Love, we're treated to first love worthy of John Hughes in his 
Breakfast Club glory days. "It's very lovely, very tender teenage love, only 
it happens to be two girls," says Ruth Vitale, president of Ted Turner's Fine 
Line Features, which is releasing the film in July. Vitale laughs at the idea 
of trying to sell it by downplaying the lesbianism; in fact, she perceives 
that as a distinct plus. "The business has become so competitive," she 
says, "that it becomes very difficult to have movies if there isn't some­
thing you can market it on." MICHAEl GILTZ</p>
