F "Nature: Silence Of The Bees"
One more thing to freak oirtabout: Bee
colonies are dying across the
country and no one knows why,
Eco-disastec or a "Bee Movie"
publicity stunt gone horribly
awry? (PBS,8 p.m.)
N"The Lost Book Of
Nostradamus" Sure. the
final predictions of this famous
seer were "misplaced" at the
National Library in Rome.
But Nostradamus knew this
book would be lost and then
rediscovered "in an age when music came in
tiny colored boxes" . . . just like iPods! So,
did the 16th century prophet know about that
last-second Apple price cut? (History,9 p.m.)N "World Series Game Fou.Fi'Even
if the Boston Red Sox sweep (hiss, boo!),
there's certain to be at least a Game Four
between them and the Colorado
Rockies. (Fox, I p.m.)

W "Running Down A
Dream" Director Peter
Bogdanovich gives the full
documentary treatment to Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers.
(Sundance, T p.m.)
N "American Masters:
Charles Schulz" cood
grief, indeed! Apparently, Charlie
Brown was well-adjusted compared with the
trbubled, depressive "Peanuts" creator, who
still made one of the 20th century's most
beloved works of art. (PBS,9 p.m.)TIJHS*AY, OCT" S0
S "Singing Bee" Ray
Parker Jr, appears to perform
"Ghostbusters." He must liye for
this time of year. (NBC, I p.m.)
W "lt's the Great
Pumpkin, Charlie
Brown" Why parse schulz's
orivate life when what matters is his
delightful legacy? We love Snoopy's World
War I Flying Ace behind enemy lines.
(C85,I p.m.)
WHMNSSMAY scT" sl
N "New York's Greenwich Village
Halloween Parade" ts that our
neighbor in the ape mask and robot suit? The
city's freak flag flies, live. (New York 1,7 p.m.)
N "Ghost Hunters Live" Want to
make contact with the spirit world? Tonight,
they all have their voice mail on.6ciFi,9 p.m.)
S "Criminal Minds" No mystery the
team solves this entire season will be as
fascinating as the disappearance of Mandy
Patinkin from the hit show. With this episode,
Joe Mantegna joins the team. (CBS, 9 p.rn.)
T$.{URSDAY, NOV" !
N "Ugly Betty" Betty and Henry make a
secret plan to meet at the Broadway musical
"Wicked." Marlo Thomas guests as a cougar

legendary Latino boy band. (MTV, 10:30 p.m.)
FRISAY, l,lSV.2
N "Moonlight" okay, if a TV show about
a vampire-turned-detective doesn't get a
bump in the ratings during Halloween week,
it's time to put a stake in it. (CBS, 9 p.m.)
N "Friday Night Lights" rhis
acclaimed drama tries to regain its footing
after a few episodes that kept the best
characters apart. Here, Coach Taylor (Kyle
Chandler) returns, and hopefully so does the
show's A-game. (NBC,9 p.m.)
SATURDAK r"{SV" 3
N "College Football: Navy at
Notre Dame" The Fighting lrish are the
only college team to have their own TV deal;
too bad they don't have much fight in'em.
Maybe the Navy team will give them a chance
to start turning it around. WBC,2:30 p.m.)
N "Ultimate Fighter" Yes, there's a
boxing match on HBO, but everyone under 50

Hughes in "Ultimate Fighter." The torch has</p>
