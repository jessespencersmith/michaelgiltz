Keep on scrolling down, because you're sure to find amovie, tv show or documentary you're interested in while looking at the biggest DVD/BluRay roundup ever!BILL HICKS: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION (DVD; Comedy Dynamics)  MR WARMTH! DON RICKLES: THE ULTIMATE TV COLLECTION ($69.95 DVD; Time Life)Few stand-up comics get a definitive boxed set like the one devoted to the late Bill Hicks. Few deserve it.Richard Pryor. George Carlin. And here, Hicks. If you wonder how or why he belongs alongside such iconicfigures, clearly you need to purchase this set. If you know he belongs with them, you might still buy this set: itcontains every official comedy album, every official DVD, plus four more CDs of audio and six DVDperformances for a solid ten hours of shows, extras and more. It's a labor of love overseen by his family and outat a very low price. Granted, the packaging is bare bones, but in this case you're here for the material.Hicks was a caustic, very smart comic (think Eddie Izzard, Carlin, etc.) who pushed boundaries. DavidLetterman famously championed him and then even more infamously wouldn't allow Hicks to do material thatshould have been approved (transferring a live act to primetime TV was always a negotiation; in this case,Letterman blew it). It's one of the few blots on Letterman's public career as a host and a pity; he made whatamends he could years later. But if it brought more attention to Hicks as a smart, subversive talent, maybe that'snot the worse thing in the world. Hicks died just four months later (he had pancreatic cancer) and since his deathhis fame has skyrocketed in the UK, where notably stand-up has much more prominence in the popular cultureand actually encourages intelligent, scathing commentary, rather than just serving as a launching pad tositcoms. He's a unique, remarkable talent that was just getting started. Some day they'll make a movie about hislife; just don't look for Denis Leary to play the lead.Don Rickles, in contrast, has enjoyed a long and unexpectedly enduring career. Many comics deal withhecklers. But Rickles WAS a heckler from beginning to end. He made his bones with a famously ballsy joke:Frank Sinatra walked into the relatively unknown comic's set and Rickles joked, "Make yourself at home, Frank.Punch somebody!" When Sinatra laughed, Rickles was a made man. In the right context (talk shows with theright host) and in notably small doses, he could be priceless. In the wrong context (an hour long set, movies, TVsitcoms), he was not. Rickles is an off-the-cuff master of zingers. Sure, he probably had the zingers stored awayfor the right moment. But knowing when to set off those depth charges, when to push the envelope and thenpush it again is a genuine gift. As Rickles got older, his sense of what was boundary pushing and what was justout-dated "outrageousness" may have dulled. But he's a unique comic.Fans of his will surely be pleased with what is by necessity a grab-bag of stuff. (Rickles has been working formore than sixty years and an ideal compilation would draw from so many diverse sources (countless episodesof Carson and Letterman, for starters) that it will be nigh in impossible until copyright expires and someone witha passion wants to dive into hundreds of hours of footage to pull out the best. What we have here are severalTV specials, clips from various shows, a TV Land award ceremony with his acceptance speech and all threeseasons of the Rickles' sitcom C.P.O. Sharkey, as good a proof as any that he was not a star in the making. On</p>

Imaginehow good he could have been as a regular at Cheers, skewering Sam and Diane with a line or two beforedisappearing into his beer. In a movie, Rickles should not the be the star: he should be somewhere two or threespots away from the lead, with the occasional crack. Witness his marvelous voice work on Toy Story. None ofthis is to limit Rickles or what he accomplished; it's simply recognition of the particular gift he had and how bestto show it off. See a few choice clips of Rickles and you'll be astonished at his pointed retorts. Spend ten or sohours slogging through a bad sitcom and so-so specials and you might be mistaken into thinking Mr. Warmthleads you cold. You'd be wrong and I'm sure Rickles would know exactly what to say to that.PIXELS ($45.99 3-D BluRay combo; Sony) DOPE ($34.98 BluRay; Universal) SOUTHPAW ($39.95 BluRay combo; Anchor Bay) PAPER TOWNS ($39.99 BluRay; Fox) A PIGEON SAT ON A BRANCH RELFECTING ON EXISTENCE (EST/VOD; Magnolia) GÃœEROS ($34.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber) MAGIC MIKE XXL ($44.95 BluRay; Warner Bros.)Some foolish people think Adam Sandler is washed up; he's retreated to Netflix because his movie career istanking! Or so the thinking goes. In fact, Sandler is more popular than ever. His movies have exploded overseasin the past decade and indeed looking at worldwide box office he's actually doing better than ever. Netflix wassmart to sign him up, at least commercially. And check out Pixels -- it's not that bad! Faint praise, but the truthfor anyone not expecting Ghostbusters redux. What critics are really responding to is not popularity, but thatmost of Sandler's movies simply haven't been good for a long time. For a brief period, he was making everythingfrom The Wedding Singer to Punch Drunk Love and some perfectly amiable comedies. Lately, those comediesare pretty witless (Pixels notably better than many), but by god they've been popular.Dope was a fun little surprise, an urban updating of Risky Business (i.e. it stars a black teenager instead of awhite one). It's not as good as that genuinely brilliant movie (make more films, Paul Brickman!) but it is fun, well-cast and occasionally a hoot. It's about Malcolm (the appealing Shameik Moore) a geek obsessed with 90s hip-hop. He accidentally comes across a pile of dope and must juggle crime lords, trying to get a date for prom andan upcoming interview for Harvard in one crazy 24 hour period. It's sweet, witty and marks both Moore andwriter-director Rick Famuwiya as talents to watch.As for Southpaw, I remember the savvy PR of Harvey Weinstein more than the paint-by-numbers storyline ofthis boxing drama. Jake Gyllenhaal is a boxer too quick with his fists; he loses his wife and custody of his babygirl and must start from the bottom (albeit minus a training in a meat locker scene) to win it all back. Gyllenhaalis indeed a terrific actor and he really was robbed last year by not even being nominated for Nightcrawler (heshould have won). But this rote drama (you can plot it out after the first ten minutes) won't be the one to bringhim new glory. It doesn't even get him back in the ring, despite his considerable appeal. Still, it's good to see himnotch a solid commercial performance.Paper Towns however didn't do remotely as well as The Fault In Our Stars. No one expected to catch lightningin a bottle twice, but because both were based on novels by John Green, someone surely was hoping theymight. In fact, it's a better film than that one, if only because the book is better. Here a high school geek is off onthe impulsive road trip of his dreams to try and track down the mysterious and beautiful girl of his dreams whogave him one wild, prank-filled night and then disappeared. Nat Wolff is an engaging hero and to be fair themysterious Margo is out of the picture for most of the movie. Still, I think casting Cara Delevigne was a mistake.Sure, he insists she's the most beautiful girl in the world but that's teenage hormones. Casting an actress whoactually looks like a runway model rather than an actual teen girl next door who's cute but you know, somewhatreal throws his obsession out of whack. Instead of being universal, you feel it's more like the story of growing up</p>

(Even though Brooke is very well read and would havemade a cool neighbor.)In a completely different tone, the new movie A Pigeon Sat On A Branch... is arthouse fare of the highest order. Ialmost never cover movies unless they're coming out on DVD or BluRay. In this case, I made an exceptionbecause Roy Andersson is a rare and beguiling talent. His new movie is the finale of a loosely connected trilogy(you certainly don't need to see the first two in order to watch this. It has no plot or characters in common; just asensibility. Songs From The Second Floor remains his masterpiece, an absurdist bit of lunacy composed of one-take shots, each vignette a self-contained, deadpan masterpiece. You, The Living is the second film, a similarhigh-wire act that was less successful but still so unique you were happy to see it. Pigeon completesAndersson's bizarro trilogy with a sense of satisfaction that raises up the second one by its presence since weknow the original wasn't a fluke. Anyone from fans of Buster Keaton to the most avant garde artists will findsomething to savor here. Are you bold? Adventurous? Prove it.Practically the definition of "promising," GÃ¼eros is the debut of writer-director Alonso Ruizpalacios. TomÃ¡s (anexcellent SebastiÃ¡n Aguirre) is a handful and his mother gives up, sending the teenager to stay with his olderbrother in Mexico City. Things do not go more smoothly for TomÃ¡s there, to say the least. It's a visually strong(good work by cinematographer Damian Garcia), funny and admittedly scattershot work that tries to doseventeen things and actually does about half of them. Fun on its own but definitely names to keep in yourbackpocket.I don't know what's funnier: the fact that some people said Magic Mike XXL was "disappointing" or the fact thatsome others defended it as some sort of post-feminist example of female empowerment and male sensitivity.Were expectations really raised by the sillier than silly and fairly incomprehensible original? And should we reallywaste time reading too much social commentary into a not-very-good movie, however much we may championmale objectification as a valid response to female objectification or just good clean fun in its own right?Channing Tatum looks good, dances well and keeps things moving in a sequel I for one thought was lesshackneyed and more fun than the original. It's a matter of degree of course and neither is a movie I'd watchagain. But a road trip where male strippers decide to stop doing routines to please others and in fact createstripper routines to empower themselves and flush out unwanted demons and empower themselves. Bring it on!It's all nonsense and peaked too soon at a bayou nightclub for sistas overseen by Rome (a fun Jada PinkettSmith). (Frankly, the routines at the big finale were too long on elaborate set-ups and short on actual sexiness.)But a disappointment? I mean, they took off their shirts. If they didn't, sure you could be angry. But otherwise, it'slike complaining about the writing in those Penthouse letters....MY FAIR LADY 50TH ANNIVERSARY ($39.99 BluRay; Paramount) BIG EDEN 15TH ANNIVERSARY ($24.95 BluRay; Wolfe) MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO ($39.95 BluRayl Criterion) DIARY OF A LOST GIRL ($29.95 BluRay; Kino Lorber) REBELS OF THE NEON GOD ($29.95 DVD; Big World Pictures) I WANT TO LIVE! ($10.95 DVD; Kino Lorber) MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL 40TH ANNIVERSARY ($19.99 BluRay; Sony)I've got a hate-hate relationship with the movie adapation of My Fair Lady. It's a crime that Julie Andrews didn'tget to recreate her stage performance. On the other hand, she got the delightful Mary Poppins (and an Oscar).Besides, i assume even with Andrews that the movie version directed with plodding competence by GeorgeCukor would have remained an enbalmed monstrosity, seemingly dragging one of the greatest and wittiestmusicals of all time through its glacial, numbingly unfunny paces. Cukor is a great director, but not of musicals.(A Star Is Born is a drama, essentially, and his last great feature.) Of course, for those who treasure it, this is alovely set, filled with extras and looking very impressive on BluRay. Not that I watched the whole movie again,</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=496403bb-01b9-4762-81b6-fb35aaf5d9a0&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&4/5but that Ascot scene certainly pops.Big Eden might have some of the same audience as My Fair Lady. This very mainstream romantic drama starsAyre Gross in probably the best role of his career: a gay man who returns home to care for his ailinggrandfather, thus confronting the high school crush he never got over and (unexpectedly) a new love. Gay rolesand gay characters were proliferating in popular culture by 2000. Nonetheless, a sweet, unaffected tale ofcoming to terms with sexuality and staying open to the promise of love struck a chord with gay audiences. Now,it's got a 15th anniversary release on BluRay with notable extras, including new interviews with the cast andwriter-director Thomas Bezucha. You need only spend a few minutes online to see what a cult favorite it is forthose in the know and this release should give it new life.A far quirkier gay drama can be found in director Gus Van Sant's oddball male hustler drama/Shakespeareanreboot. Yes, it's Henry IV redux combined with the very modern tale of a gay hustler (River Phoenix), such a lostsoul that he can drift off into dreams (or perhaps narcolepsy) at the oddest moments. In My Own Private Idaho,he falls hard for the Prince Hal-like Joaquin Phoenix (rarely better), the wealthy son of a dynasty who reallyrebels against old dad by sleeping with men for money even though he doesn't need money and isn't even gay(or bi). It's a thoroughly unique movie, brilliantly shot and containing two riveting performances by its youngleads. Your heart will break all over again for the loss of Phoenix any time you watch this. And as a bonus itfeatures the hands-down wittiest capturing of a sex scene I'll ever witness. Criterion does it right, including anew remastering and all the previous excellent extras. Don't get me wrong: I think the movie is frustratinglyflawed. But by god it has the courage of its convictions and goes all the way out there. And the stuff that is goodis so good.If you miss Phoenix, just watch Diary Of A Lost Girl and you'll miss Louise Brooks as well. She lived a long andcolorful life. But oh what might have been. For varied reasons, Brooks and Hollywood never really mixed. But asTracy said about Hepburn in one film, there's not a lot there, but what's there is choice. You've got Pandora'sBox, the charming Beggars Of Life and of course this one, a tale of daring sexuality! (Brooks loved to tease thepossibility she was a lesbian, but despite a dalliance with Greta Garbo says she preferred men.) Brooks is aremarkable screen presence, lighting up Diary's tale of an innocent girl taken advantage of by men and thenpunished for it. Anyone watching the last burst of silent film brilliance can easily understand why manybemoaned the switch to sound and how limiting and dully microphones made shooting movies for a while. Itwould be a few years before technical innovations made sound films as fluid and beautiful as silent. It would berare when any film ever was as good as the silent greats at their best, films like this one.Youthful exuberance and talent bursting to get out -- that's what you'll find in Rebels Of The Neon Gods, the1992 debut of Tsai Ming-liang, the Taiwanese director who achieved international prominence with this movieand has repeatedly proven that initial enthusiasm with justified (with Goodbye Dragon Inn and Stray Dogs justtwo of many examples). Here the director charts aimless youth, from the son of parents pushing him to excel totwo petty thieves and their pretty girlfriend. It all slowly links together in a style Tarantino and Wong Kar-waiwould appreciate. The vivid, neon-drenched world of Taiwanese arcades and malls feels like a fever dream butfor many the revelation was how contemporary and familiar the story of disaffected youth proved. Essentialcinema.Sure, kids can feel desperate. But they've got nothing on Barbara Graham, the real-life person portrayed in theanti-capital punishment melodrama I Want To Live! Susan Hayward won an Oscar for playing the prostitute,small time con artist Graham who wanted to go straight (she came from a broken home) but got caught up withthe wrong crowd and was -- she said -- framed for murder. Tough cookies, sweetheart. Director Robert Wise isnot keyed in to melodrama; his best work is sober, not sizzling But Hayward won't be denied her chance toemote the hell out of this desperate situation and won the golden statue against an admittedly weak, if star-powered field at the 31st Academy Awards.</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=496403bb-01b9-4762-81b6-fb35aaf5d9a0&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&5/5Monty Python never made a prison drama spoof. But they could have! They could do seemingly anything for awhile: a classic TV sketch show, brilliant feature films and finally spinning off into varied other projects rangingfrom the hilarious Fawlty Towers to Brazil and even a travel show. But as a Python fan, this is the peak for me.One can watch every episode of the TV show, happily. But here is everything one loves about the troupe in onequick and easy dose: seemingly high brown humor mingling with the lowest of low brow humor with a dash ofnaughtiness, a side dish of meta commentary before meta was cool and a dessert of some catchy songsbecause the Pythons loved a good sing-along. I would think it helps to have a fondness for the tales of KingArthur, but if you don't you probably will after seeing this send-up of knights and quests and Grails and about amillion other things. Not since the Marx Brothers had film comics so gleefully and successfully torn down thefourth wall along with any sense that the normal rules of cinema prevailed. Really, it's even better than werealize: not just funny but fearlessly funny.NOTE: Prices and format are strictly based on what is made available to me for review.
