Practically Poppins in Every Way
By Jeff Kurtti
$50, Disney Editions
Disney’s success on Broadway has been remarkable, from its sterling debut with  Beauty and the
Beast  (one of the best scores of all time) to  The Lion King  and the current
blockbuster  Aladdin.  A little lost amid all the hits (like Aida ) and some misfires (like The Little
Mermaid and  Tarzan )? Mary Poppins.  That sterling show is among the 25 longest-running hits in
Broadway history! And now a new feature film continues the story.This coffee table–worthy book by Jeff Kurtti is much more than a visually appealing celebration
of the franchise. It covers the history of Mary Poppins in all her incarnations, from the beloved
books by the prickly P.L. Travers to the classic feature film that earned Julie Andrews an Oscar
BOOKFILTER’S DECEMBER PICK OF THE MONTH
MICHAEL GILTZ  | DECEMBER 4, 2018
SHARE</p>
<p>to its stage debut in London … and now back again to the silver screen this December
with Mary Poppins Returns  (costarring Lin-Manuel Miranda)!
Filled with essays and anecdotes by the likes of theater giants Cameron Macintosh and Thomas
Schumacher, Disney historians, and many others, it’s the perfect setup for those eagerlyanticipating the new movie. And will anyone be surprised if Mary Poppins Returns  actually
returns the practically perfect nanny to Broadway someday? Hardly.
