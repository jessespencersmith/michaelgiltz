Trust Exercise
By Susan Choi$27, Henry Holt and Co.Published April 9
Novels are like a reverse trust exercise. Instead of falling backward and believing your friends
will catch you, a reader falls into a story, trusting the writer to play fair and not waste your time.An author may immediately reassure you with a familiar plotline or fool you into a false sense ofsecurity before taking a hard left turn. You think you’ve been caught, only to realize the net isfrayed and there’s another story underneath the one you thought you knew. Will that net hold, oris there another  rude surprise waiting? That’s the effect of Pulitzer Prize nominee Susan Choi’s
latest literary novel, Trust Exercise.  It’s set in the hothouse of a performing arts school, where
students Sarah and David fall under the spell of each other and their magnetic teacher, Mr.

<p>Kingsley. It’s the Reagan era, and Sarah is the Molly Ringwald character, a poor-ish student with
a white-knight boyfriend in David, who is almost embarrassingly wealthy. That difference hardly
matters when Mr. Kingsley turns the lights off in the classroom and students crawl over andaround each other with uncontained sensual glee. Sarah and David outpace the rest, not byhaving sex (no great marker in this world) but by the intensity of their unstableattraction/repulsion. Mixed signals aren’t the half of it. Each acting lesson — such as sittingknee-to-knee in front of the class while repeating lines to one another — is agonizing for them,but each one serves as delicious entertainment for their oohing and aahing classmates, andirresistible fodder for the quietly manipulative Mr. Kingsley. Despite the young-adult subjects,this isn’t the TV show Fame, where lessons will be gently learned. It’s more intense anddamaging than that. The story stays close to the raw, unforgiving, often-crying Sarah … untilhalfway through the novel, when the net frays and we fall into an entirely different understandingof what is going on. You don’t need a new perspective to know that the trust of the students isbeing abused, not in some dramatic scandal (though that happens too), but in a simpler,perhaps crueler way. Choi toys with our trust but it pays off in dividends. Certainly fans oftheater and serious fiction will relish how frustrating and rewarding and life-changing a dramaclass can be for adolescents, even if the closest they get to the bright lights of Broadway is aseat in the audience. Trust us.
