Leuci knows cops

boss is sleeping with a 
gangster 's moll, whose 
dad was threatened by 
Blaze.) Plus, she has her 
own problems. 
Nora is getting a 
divorce from her 
husband, who bats her 
around and steals a gun 
out of her safe-deposit 
box. Nora's partner is 
retiring and all his pent­

her are coming to the

she's attracted to an 
informant named Nicky

the streets. 
Leuci's prose takes

how good cops can be '

ask for favors. And when 
he reaches for a happy 
ending, you can't fault 
Leuci for wanting fiction 
to work out more 
satisfyingly than reality.</p>
