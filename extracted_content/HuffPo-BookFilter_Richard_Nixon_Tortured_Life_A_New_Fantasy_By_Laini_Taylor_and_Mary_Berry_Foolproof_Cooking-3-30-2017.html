<p>RICHARD NIXON: A LIFE by John A. Farrell
Our most Shakespearean -- that is, most tragic -- President is endlessly compelling. This new single volume 
biography by award-winning journalist Farrell looks at it afresh, from the well-known stories of drinking and doubt to the more recent revelations that Nixon arguably committed treason when throwing a monkey wrench
 
into peace negotiations during the Vietnam War. Why?  So he could be assured of becoming President. (Farrell calls it likely the most reprehensible act of his career.) Every President is complex, but Nixon is complex and complicit and confounding ..... Read More.

PHENOMENA by Annie Jacobsen
All's fair in love and war but sometimes things get pretty nutty. In order to maintain an edge, the US military 
has never shied away from exploring ideas however outrageous. Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen offers her latest deep dive into the mysterious byways of the Pentagon by detailing its decades-long obsession with the possibilities of E.S.P. This is no breezy, light account. Jacobsen retrieved once classified documents and interviewed everyone she could, detailing the fascinating (and sometimes promising!) research conducted by every branch of the military, the CIA, the NSA and pretty much every other member of the intelligence community you can think of.....

THE BLACK BOOK by James Patterson and David Ellis
OK, James Patterson has his name on a book seemingly every week. (Actually, you can drop the 
"seemingly.") He doesn't suffer from writer's block. He suffers from writer's blockbuster. So yeah, this is a contemporary crime novel with a detective  on the force in Chicago who is assigned to a brutal murder that 
leads him to a high end brothel catering to the Windy City's most famous. Typical. What's not typical are raves from the trades, including Publishers Weekly declaring it the best book he's been involved with in 25 years.... Read More.
