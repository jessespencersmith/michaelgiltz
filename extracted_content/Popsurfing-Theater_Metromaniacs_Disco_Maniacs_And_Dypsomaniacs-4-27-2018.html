What, pray tell, is a "translaptation?" It's a nonsense word made up by
playwright David Ives to describe his free-flowing communion withFrench farce. He adapts them and translates them and ultimatelytransmutes them into something sort of new-ish that owes a heavy
debt to the original but is all his own...and yet is not. Oh, to hell with
this mania for authorship. What Ives has created with his string oftranslaptations is a body of work that is positively delightful.
Despite a slow start, The  Metromaniacs  proves to be a fine addition to
that corpus delicti of playful plagiarism. The title refers to a mania for
poetry and is an Ivesian translaptation of a 1738 play by Alexis Piron.Ignored by the Académie Française -- despite penning an "Ode To ThePenis" which was understandably lengthy -- Piron had his revenge onthe snobs. How? By celebrating another  snubbed poet, a man who was
himself spurned by the Académie but had his  revenge. How?   By
publishing rustic poems and pretending to be a backwater poetess;"she" was immediately celebrated by one and all, including Voltaire,who offered to marry the little known versifier. (If you haven't guessed,the show's backstory is as entertaining as the show.) When the truth
came out, Voltaire was humiliated, the once-unknown poet
revenged...and then revenged once more when Piron made the scandalinfamous all over again with his play.
In steps David Ives, who uses the structure of the play to create his
own Shakespearean comedy.   Lovers are mistaken and misused mostMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>willingly until all confusion is banished and most everyone paired off
at the finale, even if the gender imbalance of five men and two women
calls for some rather inventive inverting of our expectations. I will
NOT outline the plot too clearly. It's a monster of conspiracy andconfusion, with the show itself stopping to explain matters severaltimes over and then throwing up its hands (script? pentameters?) andtelling you not to bother. Still, let's have a go.
The  Metromaniacs  takes place in the lavish home of Francalou (Adam
LeFevre), who has written his own play and looks forward to seeing it
performed for his guests. A sylvan wood has been constructed in a
large foyer/lobby/whatever as a setting. He has a lovely daughter
Lucille (Amelia Pedlow) who is besotted with poetry and is himself asecret poet of some renown. Only their servant Lisette (Dina Thomas)knows the truth.
Enter various young men. The dim Dorante (Noah Averbach-Katz)
would sorely love to couple with Lucille, but she will only couple with a
master of couplets. The poet Damis (Christian Conn) is a friend ofDorante and offers up his own scribbles so Lucille can be wooed.Damis himself is pledged to the unseen, unknown poetess all of Franceis talking about, the poetess who is -- in fact -- the amiable father ofLucille. Dorante's servant Mondor (Adam Green) and Francalou's
Lisette do what servants do: talk back to their masters while
masterminding the stratagems to pair off lover with lover and bringabout a happy ending.
And a happy ending there is, despite some modestly rough going. ActOne was not the sheer delight of other recent shows by Ives, such asThe  Liar,  The  School  For  Lies  and -- no lie -- The  Heir  Apparent.  I was
already wondering how to describe this more earth-bound, butengaging work. After the first act, I judged it was still champagne, if alittle flat. Then Act Two began and somehow the show picked up steamuntil the bubbly finale was so fun that all was forgiven.
Each actor had their moment, with Thomas a saucy servant supreme,
Pedlow pouting away, Averbach-Katz incapable of conning anyone,Green breaking the fourth wall with a well-timed smirk and PeterKybart grousing nicely as a necessary plot device/legal aide. If thewinning, handsome Conn is not precisely the lead, he certainly has the
charm of one. And LeFevre as always provides such generous warmthTHEATER: "HENRY V"

<p>and presence that any nonsense that revolves around him becomes
immediately plausible and indeed pleasurable.
Somehow the set by James Noone didn't delight -- the forest glade in
the foyer somehow wasn't incongruous enough for my taste. That's
neither here nor there since it provided plenty of hide-aways for loversto canoodle behind. All other elements were fine and it coalesced in acttwo with enough artistry to make me forget the
pacing/plotting/something-or-othering of act one that prevented me
from immediately enjoying the proceedings. So (eventual) credit todirector Michael Kahn. As with all of the plays by David Ives, I lookforward to seeing The  Metromaniacs  revived in years to come. Unlike
many others, I can imagine it being improved. But even if they merely
match the standard set here, it will be worth it for farcical-maniacs like
me.
SUMMER:  THE  DONNA  SUMMER  MUSICAL  * out of ****
LUNT-FONTANNE  THEATRE
Well, what did we expect? Actually, all we expected were some disco
balls, disco dancing and a great singer belting out some disco classics.Unfortunately, it took Summer:  The  Donna  Summer  Musical  until the
finale to really deliver the goods. Before that, we trudged through the
admittedly interesting life of disco queen Donna Summer.
When you learn that Donna Summer was sexually abused by a
preacher as a little girl, witnessed a murder and fled the country infear of her life, moved to Germany when touring with a production of
Hair,  learned the language, married, had a kid and then left her
husband to pursue stardom...well, you can understand why this
sounds like a life worth dramatizing.
Unfortunately, Summer  never moves beyond a TV movie version of
that life, dutifully showing our heroine fend off an attacker in her
home with an oversized fashion magazine, being born again thanks toher siblings and in the show's most egregious scene, seeing not one,not two but three daughters off to college and the world in three
separate scenes that -- needless to say -- are repetitive and dull to
anyone who is not actually the parent of said child. Blame book writersColman Domingo, Robert Cary and Des McAnuff (who also handledthe no-nonsense direction that keeps the 100 minute show moving).
By the time we learn she's a poor driver, loves Jesus but also loves a
married man, considered suicide and then face the not-so inevitable
moment where Summer defensively explains away an anti-gaycomment just so all the boxes of her life can be checked, this undertwo hour show begins to feel awfully long.</p>
<p>What a pity. The knee-jerk reaction is to eye-roll over another jukebox
musical. But this one had some clever ideas. Most of the cast and
chorus are women, which symbolizes the female power and #MeToovibe they were going for. Donna Summer wasn't just the Queen ofDisco, they argue, but a trailblazer for women everywhere. I'm notsure switching labels from Casablanca to Geffen qualifies as such, but
I would have been happy for the show to make its case more
convincingly, or at least more artistically. When the show begins withSummer backed by a "band" of all-female musicians, the impact of girlpower is painfully undercut by the fact that the women are almost allsimply miming the playing of instruments or doing so with only
rudimentary skill. Hey, they're dancers and singers and work hard
nonstop throughout the show so full credit to them. But when you'retrying to make a statement, simply pretending  to be a musician really
doesn't cut it. And that's just the start.
Another good idea? Summer begins dissecting how she and Giorgio
Moroder and others created their hits: all their songs began with a
bass line, she tells us. The show hints at but never quite delivers onthis premise. Why not excitingly demonstrate the creative process forone of her hits, letting the audience hear a bass line and then watch as
they toss in element after element, like the synths and arrangement
and lyrics and give the audience the thrill of hearing it all cometogether. Yet these lessons in crafting a pop hit and femaleempowerment are never followed through. (Though Summer's signingwith a new label does boast one of the better production numbers:
"She Works Hard For The Money.")
At least the three leads do indeed work hard, playing Donna Summer
at various ages, not to mention her mother and her children in thebargain. Storm Lever has the least interesting part as the young
Donna. But Ariana DeBose does well as Disco Donna and LaChanze is
the only reason this show is bearable for bringing life to Diva Donna,despite having to deliver some truly leaden exposition. She's a truepro. So is the game cast and creative team, with Paul Tazewell doingthe best work with the costumes that capture an era without being
jokey.</p>
<p>Then there are the bad ideas, like indicating the abuse Summer faced
as a child early on but waiting until a late moment in the show to spell
it out. Since we already understood what was happening, what's the
point of delaying? Even worse, the book continually interrupts thesongs for the plot. Who the heck wants to hear half  of "MacArthur
Park" or any of her others hits? These aren't songs that push the plot
or reveal character. They are pop hits and they work best in that
context. Jersey  Boys  managed the trick of teasing out the growth of
the band in act one and then revealing their hitmaker status todramatic effect. This show doesn't attempt that and worse, for far toolong it doesn't even give us the songs. It's like a jukebox musical that
keeps jumping to the next track before the last one is over.
And why the heck are we plodding our way through the life of Donna
Summer and inserting lesser songs just because they work for the plotwe never care about anyway? My God, we have to wait until the veryend for not one, not two but three giant disco balls to finally startspinning. "Hot Stuff" is the best moment of the show -- a full-on dance
number with the song presented in all its glory, backed by a big chorus
of disco dancers doing their moves. That's immediately followed by"Last Dance" -- also given its due -- and you think, what the heck werethey waiting for? Maybe it should have been staged immersively OffBroadway with a full-on disco floor and the audience surrounding and
amidst a cast of pro dancers and maybe they should have lots of disco
songs and not just Summer and a VIP section for high-payingcustomers where you can mingle with Andy Warhol and Liza andperhaps cocaine for the full 1970s effect and -- ok, that's not what they
wanted to do here. That's just a disco party.
Like the recent Motown  musical, this would have been better as the
ultimate Donna Summer show rather than a tired bio-pic. Yes,
Summer  without her life story would just be a glorified concert. So
what? At least it would be fun and we'd all remember the reason for
six years no one was played on the radio as much as Donna Summer.
THE  SEAFARER  ** out of ****
IRISH  REPERTORY  THEATRE
The bad news? A second visit to playwright Conor McPherson's scary
little Christmas story confirms the suspicion that this is one of his
lesser plays. The somewhat good news is that the brilliant Matthew
Broderick continues to shake off the ennui that has enveloped his stagework in recent years. Friends said his work in Shining  City   (also by
McPherson) felt like a reawakening for this talent. He doesn't quitescore in The  Seafarer,  but it's not as good and at least his offbeat little
rhythm remains anchored in the tale at hand.
That tale is a sad and shaggy one. Sharky is back at home, tending to
his alcoholic, recently blinded mess of a brother Richard. They live insemi-squalor, with Richard petulantly refusing to be shaved or bathed</p>
<p>on Christmas Eve, since surely he'll want to do it on Christmas Day
and why bother doing it twice? A Charlie Brown-like tree sits sadly on
a table and that's about it for holiday cheer. All Richard really wants is
to drink and drink and drink. Sharky might want to drink to forget his
shattered marriage and -- apparently -- a dashed romance with amarried woman that he has fled home to avoid. But Sharky has swornoff the stuff, at least for a day or two, much to Richard's disgust.
The two brothers bicker and fight over nothing, joined by the equally
dissolute Ivan, who would rather drink then head home (on ChristmasEve!) to face his wife and kids. She'll give him an earful for being outand drinking on Christmas Eve, so he puts off the dreaded showdown,
which means she'll be all the angrier so he puts it off again and so on
and so forth. Norman Rockwell, it isn't.
The tedium is broken only by the unwelcome arrival of Nicky, the man
shacking up with Sharky's ex-wife and driving his car, no less. Nickybrings along a stranger named Mr. Lockhart. Whebn the others are off
searching for drink or messing about with this or that, Mr. Lockhart
calmly informs Sharky that he is the devil, come for a rematch. Itturns out Sharky played cards with the devil and won his freedom afteraccidentally killing a man. But he promised to play for his soul in thefuture and now that the devil has tracked him down, it's time to playfor keeps. And the devil has every intention of winning.
McPherson is a marvelous spinner of stories, with his ghost story TheWeir  perhaps the most famous. (Irish Repertory Theatre mounted a
peerless revival of that one which deserved to run for years and did
right by his Shining  City  as well, I've been told.) Here the story is fine
enough, though it's like a less than scintillating story told by an old
friend who is usually a dependable raconteur -- you need to indulgehim a little to keep it going and don't mind, not really. He's told betterstories before and will do so again.
Of the cast, Andy Murray made the strongest impression as the put-
upon Sharky while the rest were quite variable, I fear. Broderick inrecent years has seemed to enter Brando territory, searching for someinternal rhythm or just maybe bored by the process or something  to
the point where one wants to shake him awake. Here, he is stilldelivering an odd, distant turn but it feels a little more rooted in the</p>
<p>proceedings. I'll take hope where I can, especially in a play with
precious little of it. Colin McPhillamy as Richard is overshadowed by
the ghost of performances past. (More on that soon.)
The shambling set by Charlie Corcoran and stained costumes by
Martha Reilly make sure we never hope for a holly, jolly Christmas.
But the original music by Ryan Rumery was played at such a jarring
high volume it's impossible to judge the merits of the tunes on theirown. Do I blame director Ciarán O'Reilly for this and other faults? Ordo I blame my memory of the original Broadway production? Eventhen I had reservations about the play. But Ciarin Hinds was a more
menacing devil. And as the alcoholic Richard, actor Jim Norton
delivered a performance so indelible, so remarkable I'll remember itfor the rest of my days. He won the Tony for it and if he hadn't,everyone who saw the show would have stormed the stage like Kanyeand demanded a recount.
Poor McPhillamy (hell, poor Olivier or poor Mark Rylance) could not
compete with that memory. I'd suggest you might enjoy this
production more if you'd never seen it before, but I enjoyed thatproduction primarily because  of Norton. Unwrapping this Christmas
story a second time does it no favor.
