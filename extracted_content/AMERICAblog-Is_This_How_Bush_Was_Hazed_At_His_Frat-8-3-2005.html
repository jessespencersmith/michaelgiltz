8/03/2005 12:22:00 PMThe Washington Post on US soldiers' brutal treatment ofprisoners, all of which they believed was "approved" fromabove.Iraqi Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush was being stubbornwith his American captors, and a series of intense beatingsand creative interrogation tactics were not enough to breakhis will. On the morning of Nov. 26, 2003, a U.S. Armyinterrogator and a military guard grabbed a green sleepingbag, stuffed Mowhoush inside, wrapped him in an electricalcord, laid him on the floor and began to go to work. Again.It was inside the sleeping bag that the 56-year-old detaineetook his last breath through broken ribs, lying on the floorbeneath a U.S. soldier in Interrogation Room 6 in thewestern Iraqi desert. Two days before, a secretCIA-sponsored group of Iraqi paramilitaries, working withArmy interrogators, had beaten Mowhoush nearlysenseless, using fists, a club and a rubber hose,according to classified documents...."The indig were hitting the detainee with fists, a club and alength of rubber hose," according to classified investigativerecords.Soldiers heard Mowhoush "being beaten with a hardobject" and heard him "screaming" from down thehall, according to the Jan. 18, 2004, provost marshal'sreport. The report said four Army guards had to carryMowhoush back to his cell.Not exactly "Animal House," is it? Mowhoush was killed, of course."The interrogation techniques were known and wereapproved of by the upper echelons of command of the 3rdACR," [the lawyer for one of the soldiers] said in a newsconference. "They believed, and still do, that they wereappropriate and proper."And you know what? They were wrong to do what they did, but rightto believe the people in power were all for it. Bush has made thatperfectly clear again and again. If not, why has no one in chargeduring these outrages been reprimanded in the least? Why insteadhas almost everyone involved been promoted and praised? This is thesort of vile nastiness we used to condemn the bad guys for -- the sortof cruel, nasty torture our soldiers endured from the OTHER sideduring Vietnam and Korea and from the Nazis and the Japs in the lastrighteous war. It is not a sign of strength -- torture is always a sign ofweakness. And it is beneath the dignity of the United States.
