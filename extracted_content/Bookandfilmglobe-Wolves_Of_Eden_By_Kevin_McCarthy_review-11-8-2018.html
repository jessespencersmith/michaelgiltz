<p>FICTION  
How The West Was Won?
Kevin McCarthy’s Historical Fiction Pulls No Cowpunches
 November 8, 2018  Michael Giltz
Westerns used to promise a simple tale of good versus evil. But that was a long, long time ago. Even way back
when the best writers–like Elmore Leonard and Larry McMurtry–knew better. Today any author worth their saltknows if they’re going to write about how the West was won, then they’ll also be writing about how the Westwas lost.
Certainly Kevin McCarthy knows this well. He sets his new historical novel “ Wolves Of Eden ” just after the
Civil War. The US military has pivoted from putting down secession to protecting settlers as they race out West
for land or gold, and to hell with the Injuns in their way. Along for the ride are career soldiers and the poorbastards broken by the war or so used to violence they’re unfit for civilian life. You’ll find Irish and Germansand Italians and even a Jew or two, if you can imagine, not to mention Native Americans from various tribes.
McCarthy captures the sweep of the era, the malignant memory of the violent Civil War that has poisoned the
men who fought in it and much more. But above all he juggles four men and two competing narratives with
vivid style. In one, the Jewish Corporal Daniel Kohn finds himself burdened with caring for Captain Martin</p>
<p>← Triggered By ‘Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’ ‘The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs’ →Molloy, a drunken wreck of an Irishman haunted by his actions in the war. Kohn respects Molloy and can’t bear
to see the man committing suicide by bottle. Their superiors send them way out West to investigate the murderof a prominent citizen at Fort Kearney. Their job is to find someone–anyone–to blame for the death and bringthem to heel.
At the same time, we read the diary of Michael O’Driscoll, held in the stockade for that very crime, though it’s
unclear if he committed it. Michael and his brother Tom (a once-handsome man disfigured in the war) werehoping to earn a few dollars, then quietly “resign” from the military and farm a plot of land. Things have notgone to plan.
McCarthy has “Deadwood”-style fun with the grim realities of life on the “frontier”. Ethnic slurs fly about. It’s
a raw and vicious world as typified by the scout Molloy hires for the journey. “Jonathan” is a Pawnee whorefuses to give his real name (they would butcher it anyway). He casually wonders if he should just kill theseuseless stragglers, but is happy to work alongside the white men if it means a chance to kill the Sioux, a peoplehe hates with real passion.
It’s a rich and compelling tale. McCarthy falters only in withholding two key bits of intelligence: how the
citizen at the fort was actually killed and the dreadful act during the war that Molloy can’t shake. Creating anunnecessary air of mystery does neither set piece any good. Far better is McCarthy’s use of history. Here thereal Battle of the Hundred-in-the-Hands of 1866 provides a good backdrop to the action, not to mention a greatand terrible victory for Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians (Crazy Horse among them) who banded togetherto crush the white people once and for all. Or so they imagined. Michael O’Driscoll does begin to realize thesoldiers really don’t belong where they are. Even the grass seems to be whispering to him that they should goaway go away go away. But that whispering is soon drowned out.
