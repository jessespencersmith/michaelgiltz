9/03/2005 11:50:00 AMCORRECTION FROM JOHN: The Independent is wrong. Itwasn't until Wednesday that Bush surveyed the damage fromAir Force One. He didn't return to DC or give his speech untilWednesday afternoon.----------Our message is getting out to the MSM. Even overseas they arebeginning to focus on the incredible callousness of Bush andCo. The Independent runs down the facts. Here's just the firstquestion:Why has it taken George Bush five days to get to NewOrleans?President Bush was on holiday in Texas when Katrinastruck. He then spent Monday on a pre-arrangedpolitical fundraising tour of California and Arizona,which he did not cancel or curtail. On Tuesday hesurveyed the hurricane damage - but only from the flightdeck of Air Force One, prompting criticism that he was toodetached from the suffering on the ground. He didn't give aspeech until Tuesday afternoon - 36 hours after the stormfirst hit - and didn't embark on a proper tour of the regionuntil yesterday. Key advisers have come under fire forsimilar levels of detachment. As the full magnitude ofthe disaster unfolded, the Secretary of State,Condoleezza Rice, was seen buying shoes in NewYork, and Dick Cheney remained on holiday.
