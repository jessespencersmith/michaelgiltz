7/16/2005 10:21:00 PMI was not a fan of Hillary Clinton and would have voted forRudy opposite her in the Senate race (though I think he'dmake a better governor than Senator and this was before hishard-right turn). But I have to include myself among the vastmajority of New Yorkers who have been won over by Clinton'shard work, focus on the essentials and canny political moves.She's done a bang-up job as Senator and honestly I was NOTexpecting that. She's also making every right move inpreparing for her (first?) run at the White House.When NYC made a final push towards the Olympics, Clintonwas an offhand last minute addition. She turned out to be thebiggest draw -- by far -- for the international community.Clinton was far more popular than world leaders like Chirac andBlair and even the biggest sports stars in the world, includingsoccer's David Beckham. We've also seen numerous pollsshowing how Clinton has won over virtually ALL the undecidedsin New York with her fine job. Yes, there's a minority that can'tstand her, just as there's a minority that will always hate anypolitico, whether it's Reagan or Bush or Clinton, Bill orwhomever.Now the NYT has a strong, fascinating look at Clinton'sevolution politically and professionally, worth checking out foranyone who wants a reality check about the fears Clinton isgoing too far to the right/mainstream with some of herpositions. I think this shows her being true to her beliefs whilebeing savvy in how she frames them. Well worth reading. I'mnot sure I'd support her in the primaries or what kind ofPresident she'd make. But I feel a lot better about her nowthan I did 4 years ago. And I KNOW Bill would make anawesome First Husband.
