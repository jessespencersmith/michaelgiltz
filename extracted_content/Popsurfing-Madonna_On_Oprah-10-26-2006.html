            <p>T H U R S D AY,  O C TO B E R  2 6 ,  2 0 0 6Madonna On OprahI've always liked Madonna because she's a great songwriter, deliveringone clasisc pop tune after another for more than 20 years. All the otherstuff -- the attention, the controversy -- is just noise. And of courseshe's always portrayed as one tough cookie. So why aren't I surprisedthat she came across as so confused and hurt by the attention broughtto her adoption of a little boy from Africa. Despite her clear emotionalfeelings on the topic, Madonna was typically thoughtful and intelligentin discussing her actions. Yes, she could have adopted a little blackbaby right here. But since her participation in Live 8 led Madonna toset up charitable works in Malawi, she had paid several visits to thecountry and was obviously familiar with the many sick and dying kidsthere. So she adopted one. Makes sense to me. If she'd done charitablework in China, maybe it would have been a Chinese baby. If she'd donecharitable work in New Orleans, it might have been a child from there.Shouldn't we be happy any wealthy person who has had kids on theirown would choose to adopt a child from anywhere in the world?Abandoned and neglected children will never run out, unfortunately. Ifit becomes "trendy" to adopt a kid from Africa, why then there will be afew less children in that country without a home. Where's the harm?And for someone so savvy, Madonna sure was surprised her actionscaused a worldwide sensation. I could have told her that would happen-- maybe she knew that and just wasn't expecting the attention to be sonegative. Whether she produces a book of erotica or adopts a baby,Madonna can't help stirring the media into a frenzy.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Furthermore, she's not donating3 mil of her own , but rather soliciting donations. The press has beenvery kind in this respect.3:16 PM
