11/06/2004 01:49:00 PMSe. Christopher Dodd has already reportedly given up on running forthe post of minority leader, according to the New York Times. Theypaint it as inevitable that the milquetoast, appeasing, "peace in ourtime" Harry Reid of Nevada will get the job.Dodd is dispirited by being in the minority and having little or nochance of a major position of power, despite having served for 24years. So now he may leave office to run for Governor of Conn.(Besides, if you want to run for President, being governor is a lotbetter than being a Senator.) Chuck Schumer of NY and Jon Corzineof NJ are also both abandoning the weak Senate and running forgovernor of their states.Two things: who can blame him and, just as importantly, we need toreally push for a better minority leader. Email, phone or write yourreps in Washington and tell them you DON'T support Reid and thatnothing is a done deal and that the Dems need a strong leader who isgoing to champion our values and fight the Republicans, not appeasethem. Not when we have votes for Supreme Court justices loomingon the horizon, rising deficits, and attacks on our personal liberties.Joe Biden is just one good alternative. Call! It matters! Feelingdistraught by the election? Here's something you can do.
