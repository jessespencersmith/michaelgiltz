            <p>PlalleJ, TraillJ and' Allto1llobileJ has 
arrived on schedule for these deregulated 
times, This John Hughes comedy about a 
businessman with tr,wel difficulties is being 
released today across the nation by P"r,,­
mount Pictures. 
They held a screening and press confe­
rence earlier this month in Hollyw(xxl to 
promote the movie nnd-quite fittingly- I 
missed my flight from Gaines­
ville. 
But life hadn't finished imi­
tating art. As a phalanx of 
television cameras lined the 
press room, reporters from 
across the country sat with tape 
recorders in hand, waiting for 
eve MaTtin, John Gndy and 
Hughes to appear. They waited. 
And waited. And waited. 
As they soon f(iund out; Gn­
dy's flight had been delayed 
because of b-Jd weather. Studio 
executives found their carefully 
--"~"--'estrated media event bam­
boozled by the very same 
problem Hughes had ,mined so 
well in his film. 
After several hours of delay, 
the decidedly friendly question­
ing began. The affair t(xlk place 
in a sound stage on tbe Para­
mount Studios lot, and anyone 
who fears more time and crea­
tivity is spent promoting a 
movie than actually lIIdkillg it 
would not have had their fears 
allayed. 
The stage had been con­
verted into a mock airport ter­
~inal complete with unifor~ed 
dows overlooking a runway. 
The only thing "missing" was 
the luggage, and they probably 
arranged to have that sent to 
Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Though his first major triumphs were 
sCripts for sueh "adult" movies as NlllionJ 
LJlIIpmm's VdCdtiml and Mr. M(}lII, the 
label-hungry press has tagged-him a "teen" 
director. Still, it's true thllt P/t4JleS is the first 
time Hughes has w(~ pid:l a cast com­
posed'(,f adults, and he isn'r above poking 
fun at how he is perceived.</p>
<p>When asked why he chose Martin and' 
Candy, Hughes said, "They were forced on 
me by the studio. We were looking for Rob 
Lowe and Judd Nelson." 
No one forcedJohn Candy to be involved. 
He clearly looked thrilled just to be there. In 
films like S'IIIIII/('/" I?ell/,d and Art1,i?(r,mc/ 
DlIllgemll.r, he appeared to be trapped in the 
"Jolly John Candy" character that first made 
him famous on SCTVand in Sp/dxh.lt was 
difficult to tell whether he was incapable of 
more or just never given the opportunity.

Now it's crystal clear, for Plane .• is his 
,chance to playa Real Character and Candy 
makes the most of it. Martin and Hughes 
praise his ptrformance, with Martin calling 
it "his best work ever." But Candy remains 
modest, citing the script as the important

<p>Now it's crystal dear, for Plune.1" is his 
\ chance to plilY. a Real Character and Candy 
makes the most of it. Martin and Hughes 
praise his ~rformance, with Martin calling 
it "his best work ever." But Candy remains 
modest, citing the script as the important 
ingredient .. 
Still, not everything has changed. When a 
Japanese r~porter began a question directed 
to -Candy by saying, "The Japanese are a 
small people and we are great admirers of 
men of large size," he adopted a God-I'm­
macho pose and said in a deep, burly voice, 
"Why thank you," ahd the entire-room of 
reporters burst into laughter. 
. Paramount hopes tbe laughter will conti­
nue this Thanksgiving and Christmas. If'S 
the most successful studio in Hollywo<xl, 
blessed witWmajor st'ars like Tom Cruise 
and a magic touch: Its current blockbuster is 
Futul.AttructiD1l , a thriller abOut infidelity 
that came out of left field to dominate the 
box office for the last twO months. 
Tnis is not something a studio with 
Baed), Hil!'r Cop /I and The U11IrJ1(chu/;/eJ 
under its belt needed, but that's what hap­
pens when you're on a roll. Paramount 
would like to keep on rolling into the new 
year with two major releases. 
The first is Rafl', a concert film starring 
Eddie Murphy. Filmed d!lring his expletive­
and audience-filled comedy tour, Rdll' is 
certain to draw a huge adult audience . 
. PldneJ was seen as the wholesome, 
family-oriented round in their double­
barrelled cinematic shotgun. And the fin­
ished pnxluct delivered by Hughes certainly 
fits the bill: It's a sweet, sentimental tale 
. with nary a trace of nudity or violence. 
Unfortunately, it came. wrapped in an</p>
<p>"R" rating, courresy of the Motion Picture 
Ass{xiation of America. This undeserved 
ruling hinges on a crucial scene in which 
Martin's characrer urrers "the 'f' word." "But 
only 19 times," he says with mock 
indignation. 
In the scene, Neal Page has finally 
cracked under the frustrating problems he's 
borne so silenrly. The normally unflappable 
businessman begins lashing our hke a 'loose 
cable, berating an innocent car rental agent 
in an arrempt co get transporration. 
It is unquestionably one of the funniest 
~oments in the movie, and it is also quite 
unoffensive. Hughes notes that he had "no 
intentions of being controversial." Martin 
concurs, stressing that it was not gratuitous 
and very much "the culminations of this 
character's frustrations,"</p>
<p>Paramount IS probably frustrated at hav­
ing their nice little movie slapped with an 
"R" rating and it's hard to imagine a better 
candidate for "~G-13" than PI.J1lf!.f. 
Still, this controversy probably will be 
seen as only a minor annoyance a few weeks 
from now. With the formidable marketing 
of the studio, the comoined draw of Steve' 
Martin and John Hughes and the film's very 
real audience appeal, Pla1Zf!.f should enjoY'a 
healthy success. . 
Appropriately, Hughes is now prepping 
the release of Shf!·.f Hat'i1lg A. 8db)', a' 
comedy about a young couple with a child on 
the way, which stars Kevin Bacon and 
Elizabeth McGovern. ' It's appropriate 
because the movie was originally scheduled 
to appear on screens ,in the spring of '87,but 
was delayed time anp again amid the inevit­
able rumors of problems. 
Hughes insists that they aren't true. He 
says he is "thrilled" that Paramount was 
willing to let him wait until next _year, 
because the two-week lag between the end 
of filming on Bab)' and the starting of PI" Ilf!.r 
didn't give him' enough time to properly 
deal with the final editing and scoring. He 
has promised them a delivery date and they 
have tentatively set a release for early next 
year. But Paramount should know better. 
than anyone not to expect Rd))' to arrive on 
time.</p>
