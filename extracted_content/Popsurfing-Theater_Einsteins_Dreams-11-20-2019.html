THEATER: "Einstein's Dreams" Too Elusive For
Reality
EINSTEIN'S  DREAMS  * 1/2 out of ****
PROSPECT  THEATER  COMPANY   AT  59E59
Alan Lightman's charming novel Einstein's  Dreams  was a best-selling
sensation in 1992. Lightman's day job is a physicist and his first and
best work of fiction playfully combines both disciplines. In it, heimagines Einstein is working on his Theory of Relativity and dreams
about the various ways one can think about time. What if time really
did stand still? What if time proceeded in circles? Or skipped andstuttered or reversed itself unexpectedly? Each dream of time iscaptured in a fragmentary passage lasting just a few pages at most. It'snot really a novel or even a collection of short stories, but more like a
variation on a theme.
Lightman lets you feel you grasp certain abstract scientific ideas, all
while entertaining you thoroughly. But there's no plot to speak of, noover-arching thread. It's just fanciful fun. Even the packaging of the
book added to its appeal: Einstein's  Dream  was about 5 inches wide by
7 inches tall, almost a square, friendly little book. It fit into your hands
comfortably and made this Italo Calvino-like work quite approachable.Instead of thinking, a book about physics and running away, you sawit and smiled and picked it up.
I read it, I enjoyed it and not for a single moment did I think, this
should be adapted for the stage! It's one of those works that wouldseem to resist a transformation into film or theater or TV. Of course, Ifelt the same about Milan Kundera's  The  Unbearable  Lightness  of
Being.  Turn that daunting, philosophical novel into a film? Absurd!
Turn the classic Powell-Pressburger movie 
A  Matter  Of  Life  and
Death  into a stage play? Ridiculous!  
Well, as a film, Unbearable  became another masterpiece. As a play, A
Matter  Of  Life  and  Death  was a disaster. But hey, they tried! SoMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: "Pump Girl" Finds A
Gusher At Irish Rep</p>
<p>anything can be turned into anything else and the less likely, perhaps
the more remarkable it will be if you get the alchemy right.
Apparently, people have been trying and trying with Einstein'sDreams  ever since it was published. Per Wikipedia, this work has been
adapted endlessly into plays and song cycles and dance pieces and here
a musical, one that first debuted in 2005. As far as I know, none of
them have worked. This version is no different. Joanne SydneyLessner did the book and Joshua Rosenblum did the music and theyboth worked on the lyrics. Here, Time is personified into a dream-like
lover for young Albert Einstein. He keeps dreaming of Time in all her
fickle possibilities and she teases him on towards the revelation of theTheory that will make him immortal.
Little of this works, despite a game cast that struggles to sing the
awkward songs the creative team   crafted. However, the Prospect
Theater Company has given this ineffective mess directed by CaraReichel an exceptionally handsome production. Einstein's desk at thepatent office sits on a round dais stage left. A staircase on stage rightswoops up to a wide platform on the second level. Striking design work
covers the stage floor with expected but effective details of time and
the such. And a giant round clock face hangs above the stage, servingas a screen for countless projections, the vast majority of which areimpressive and on point.
David Bengali did the excellent projection design and Sidney Shannon
the period-friendly costumes. Kevin Heard dealt with the sounddesign that balances actors, singers and a fine six-piece orchestra ledby music director and pianist Milton Granger, not to mention varioussubtle sound cues. And the ravishing scenic design is by Isabel
Mengyuan Le. It's a pleasure to behold while you wait for the show to
begin and something to study when the show quickly goes awry. Iremember very little of the musical's feverish attempts to give theerudite and funny and odd musings of Lightman some sort of plot. Butthe set? I'd love to spend more time with it.THEATER: "The Crucible" Is
