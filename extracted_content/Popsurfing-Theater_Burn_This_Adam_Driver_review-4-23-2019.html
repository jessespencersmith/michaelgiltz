THEATER: "BURN THIS" BARELY SMOLDERS
BURN  THIS  ** out of ****
HUDSON  THEATRE  
Oh the mystery of chemistry. Two actors can be happily married in
real life and yet on camera or onstage...nothing. The reverse is true, of
course. Two actors can despise each other and yet sparks flies on stageand on film. You never really know what will happen until theyactually share the same space and put in some work. More's the pity.
When you're casting actors of the fame and calibre of Keri Russell and
Adam Driver, they don't audition. Of course not. But they also don't sittogether in a room and check to see if they're compatible, if they canfeel that electric charge, that extra intensity that says "We've gotsomething here." Maybe they should.
Lanford Wilson's Burn  This  was the last major success of the Pulitzer
Prize-winner who helped revolutionize Off Off Broadway. Over the
years, it has dimmed in the collective memory, now usually seen as a
flawed play galvanized by Joan Allen and especially John Malcovich in
a legendary, barn-burning performance. Any revival worth its salthopes to redeem a show's first success or rescue a work from suchretrospective downgrading. After 20 years away from Broadway,Wilson will have to wait for redemption. The utter lack of chemistrybetween the two leads makes the play confusing to newcomers like
myself and leads to all sorts of lazy puns on a production not catching
fire.
Russell is Anna, a young choreographer in the world of modern dance
who shares a loft-like apartment in New York City with two gay men
while dating a wealthy screenwriter. One of her roommates has just
died tragically and she returns home, having endured a funeral whereit was clear the family never saw their dancer son strut his stuff, can'tor won't admit he was gay and prefer to pretend Anna was the dead  
man's lover. She pours this out to her boyfriend Burton (David Furr)until her gay pal Larry comes home (Brandon Uranowitz, having theMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

worst is over.

But it's not. Late in the first act, late at night, Pale begins pounding on
their door. Pale (Adam Driver) is the brother of the dead dancer andhe's nominally there to pick up then guy's stuff. But Pale is drunk and
belligerent, a motormouth who can't stop complaining in blunt, blue
collar terms about the city, the streets, about parking and what about adrink and Anna sure is good looking. Sparks -- at least on the page --fly.
Now in the play I saw, Pale is a thoroughly unappealing louse. Of
course he's not Anna's type (not officially anyway), but he reallydoesn't seem anyone's type. He's dressed like a slob, but is obsessiveabout his pants being kept spotless. Pale wears silk shirts of the sort alow-level thug in the mob might wear thinking it's classy. He's themanager of a restaurant and I think he said it was in Jersey and I
thought, well it wouldn't be in Manhattan, not this bruiser. When
Larry says he's been to the restaurant (twice) and it's quite good, I'msurprised. Looking at him, you'd expect he manages an anonymousItalian restaurant with cheap house wine.
Pale is definitely a character. He's loud and tiresome and drunk and
angry and maybe sort of sad about his brother dying and maybe youfeel a little bad for him but mostly you just want him to go away. Thenhe's sitting on the couch with Anna and they're talking and he puts his
arm around her and you freeze up. Yikes, he's totally misread the
situation and how is she going to get out of this him exploding orhurting her or worse? To my surprise, she doesn't want to -- indeedshe's eager to make love to him. That one night stand becomes --against her better judgment -- an ongoing fling that threatens to end
her relationship with Burton (naturally) but finally unleashes her
imagination. Anna's choreography has never been better because she'sfinally feeling something.

<p>sexy, a rough Brando-esque of a beast that may be rough and angry
but my god women want him. He's supposed to be a very good dresser
(clearly costumer Clint Ramos went in another direction) and thesemismatched lovers are fated to be together. Yet that magic something,
that chemistry that is utterly lacking in these two acclaimed actors left
me utterly at sea. Nothing they said or did made sense because I neverthought for a second they wanted each other. Eventually, the entireplay felt forced. Uranowitz made the most of his cliche of a "funny gay
roomie" but even he can't make sense of his character quoting an old
movie and shaking his ass at a climactic moment.
Just as impenetrable to me is Anna's relationship with Burton; they
don't seem to have any particular chemistry either. We know he's rich
and eventually we learn he's asked her to marry him several times.Even that is a surprise, since their relationship just doesn't feel thatsignificant. If we're meant to believe he's the safe pick or thecompromise pick of Anna, that doesn't track either -- not because heseems so great but because it's hard to say what she thinks of him at
all. And while Pale is an obvious sort with no hidden depths, who is
Anna? Larry "explains" her to Burton late in the show -- he says she'snever had to carry her own passport or plane ticket. Huh? She's richtoo? Other than a brief reference to her fancy childhoodneighborhood, we don't have the slightest sense that she's wealthy orsheltered or privileged to any particular degree. And if she is, the lure
of Burton is surely lessened. Who needs him?
Even the music cues are confusing. It's mostly a parade of 80s era
songs (Yes's "Owner Of A Lonely Heart," Roxy Music's "Avalon," BruceSpringsteen's "I'm On Fire" and so on) keying us into the late 1987
time period. The parade of tunes sets the tone for the entire evening,
long before the play even starts. But at the last second they drop in akiller: the moody classic "Pink Moon" by Nick Drake. It's a great songand it's played just as the lights go down and the play begins. If
anything is supposed to tip the show's hand, to say "This is what we're
about," playing a particular song just as the show begins should be it.But it's most assuredly not a key track from the 1980s, having beenreleased to zero attention in 1972 and finding belated success in 1999via a car ad. More to the point, unlike every other song they play, it's
not by any stretch a love song. I'm not sure they even know that.
So does this mean the reputation for Burn  This  should fall further?
Not really, not based on a single revival that doesn't work and at least
in part for a reason that has nothing to do with the play itself. If they
do it again in ten years and it fails again, then maybe Wilson's final
success will slip further in our estimation. Happily, his key role inmaking Off Off Broadway viable will remain.
