            <p>F R I D AY,  A P R I L  1 4 ,  2 0 0 6My New Favorite CultA UK news story about a bishop denouncing a cult brought me to thiswacky tale. Apparently, the host of the UK version of the TV gameshow"Deal Or No Deal" has been talking up this wacky German book called"The Cosmic Ordering Service: A Guide To Realizing Your Dreams." Inshort, just relax: if you want something, write it down and ask for it andyou'll get it. The talk show host now appears on air with symbolswritten on his hands (such as stars, rain clouds and GRAPES)indicating his affinity for this.[The talk show host] has said that four of his six wishes havecome true, including the acquisition of a holiday home in theSouth of France. He believes that he got what he wanted withinsix months of reading Mohr’s book, given to him by hisreflexologist.In a recent interview, he said: “You’ll think I’ve gone away withthe fairies — but it’s fantastic. It is quite reassuring about lifeafter death and spiritual things. I have faith. I don’t know whatshape it is. I feel uncomfortable to think it’s purely Church ofEngland, and I’d like to learn more about Islam.”The Cosmic Ordering Service has sold a million copies inGermany alone. Mohr maintains that if you write down a wish,or shout it out of a window, it is likely to come true.Indeed, the author Mohr said she got the castle she asked for! (Imagineif we all asked for castles -- and you thought the real estate boom hadpeaked.) But the plot thickens. Look up the book on Amazon.co.uk andyou find out it's the Number One bestseller for them -- and yet, thereare NO official reviews or fan comments. Huh? The most obscurebooks in the world have at least a few reader comments and thenumber one book on Amazon has NONE? Fishy. The US listing doeshave eight or so comments, including one from a guy who finds ithelpful to write down his requests on a piece of paper and then setthem on fire. (I'll stick to bellowing out my window "I want mycomputer to work!")But the fun doesn't stop there: the books recommended for peoplechecking this one out have such delightfully absurd titles as "I'm RichBeyond My Wildest Dreams. I Am. I Am. I Am. How To Get EverythingYou Want In Life" and "Write It Down, Make It Happen: KnowingNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
