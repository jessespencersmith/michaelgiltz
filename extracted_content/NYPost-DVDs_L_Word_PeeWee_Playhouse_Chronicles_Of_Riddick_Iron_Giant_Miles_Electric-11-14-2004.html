Pee-wee's Playhouse: 
Volume 1 and 2 **** Image, $49.99 each 
Surreal, silly, clever, and flat-out 
funny. Winner of 22 Emmys, 
"Pee-wee's Playhouse" is one of 
the best children's shows of all 
time and it''S a crime the 45 
episodes from its five year run 
(1986-1990) haven't been seen 
on TV in the last 14 years. No 
extras, but every frame of the 
show is bursting with invention. 
The secret word? "Finally!" 
J., The Chronicles 
of Riddick * Universal, $29.98 -----
When is a movie star not a 
movie star? When he's Vin 
Diesel. His latest actioner 
wasted Judi Dench and a lot of 
special effects to gross a 
modest $57 million (a big 
disappointment for the second 
in an intended trilogy). That 
follows the dud "A Man Apart" 
and "XXX." Lots of typical 
extras and 15 minutes of new 
footage. 
The Iron Giant 
Special Edition *** Warner Bros., $19.96 
If you flipped for "The 
Incredibles" (and who The LWord *** Showtime, $69.99 
Desperate, but not 
housewives -that's 
the premise of this 
soapy look at L.A. 
lesbians. Jennifer 
Beals, Pam Grier, 
Mia Kirshner and 
others keep Jt fun. 
The extras are so-so, 
except for a puppet 
show reenacting the 
meeting of two main 
characters that is 
goofily funny. Also 
just out: "Too Close 
For Comfort: Season 
One" (Rhino, 
$39.95), "Smallville: 
Third Season" 
(Warner Bros., 
$59.98) and "Buffy: 
Season Seven" (Fox, 
$59.98). 
hasn't?), check out director 
Brad Bird's critically 
acclaimed film debut 'The 
Iron Giant," which has that 
new movie's subtle smarts 
wrapped around a more low­
key, Cold War era story. Lots 
of new extras, including an 
especially interesting 
commentary track by Bird and 
a host of others. 
Miles Electric *** Eagle Eye, $19.98 
When Miles Davis embraced 
fusion and a rock beat in 1969 
for his best-selling "Bitches 
Brew," it created more 
controversy than any music 
since Bob Dylan went electric. 
This new documentary 
explores the stir Davis created, 
along with the legendary 38 
minute one-song set his band 
played at the Isle of Wight 
Festival 
for 
600,000 
people. 
Also 
just out: 
"Norah 
Jones 
Live 
2004" 
(Blue 
Note, 
$19.98), 
from an 
artist who never upset anyone, 
and "Crosby, Stills & Nash: 
DVD Collection" (Rhino, 
$44.99).</p>
