9/13/2005 02:16:00 PMWe asked yesterday when Bush was going to demand Congresscancel those draconian bankruptcy laws going in effect October17. How could he look at all the people whose lives have beendestroyed, how could he face the owners of all those smallbusinesses crushed by Katrina and say, "Screw you?"Apparently, we weren't the only ones asking.According to USA Today, consumer advocates and Democratswant to delay the bankruptcy law or exempt hurricane victims.Even Bush may be too embarrassed to see these meanspiritednew laws applied to the families devastated by Katrina:The Bush administration is looking at "a long list of ways tohelp those affected by the storm," including providingthem with some relief from pending bankruptcy rules,says White House spokesman Trent Duffy.This raises the question: if the new bankruptcy laws are so draconianor unfair for victims of Katrina, why aren't they unfair when punishingthe victim of the next hurricane? Why aren't they unfair whenpunishing the victim of a catastrophic illness? Why aren't they unfairwhen punishing someone who lost their job at Enron because thewhite collar criminals in charge drove their company into the ground?Everyone wants to fight fraud (the pretense for passing these cruelnew rules), but if the new bankruptcy law is wrong when applied tovictims of Katrina then it's wrong when applied to anyone, regardlessof the catastrophe that has blindsided them.If the Democrats had any backbone, they would push to overturn thatlaw, using Katrina as a classic example of why it's bad. If theRepublicans offer the compromise of delay, they should refuse onprinciple, insisting on full reversal. Let the Republicans explain whythese people should suffer.
