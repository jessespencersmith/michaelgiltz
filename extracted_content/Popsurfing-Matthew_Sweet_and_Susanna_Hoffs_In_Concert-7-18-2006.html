            <p>T U E S D AY,  J U LY  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs In ConcertHad a delightful time last night at the Bowery Ballroom. MatthewSweet and Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles were promoting theirsuper-fun duets album "Under The Covers," which has themperforming classic and obscure Sixties pop songs. A decent crowd butnot too full, a relaxed show (Hoffs apologized for forgetting the lyrics toone song, saying they'd only had one day to rehearse this first show)and a GREAT lead guitarist. High point: in the sweltering heat, I turnedto my friend and said, "I wish they'd play some songs with water inthem" and the band immediately launched into the Beatles' "Rain."Low Point: when two guys in the audience were wondering who thatsong was by, someone told them the Beatles. But was it written byGeorge Harrison? "Yes!" I said definitively and with great assurance.They just KNEW I was right. I was wrong. Despite its Middle easterndrone sound, it's credited to Lennon/McCartney and I assume ismostly Lennon given its structure. One schmuck in the audience keptshouting out "BBC!" "BBC!" I had no idea why. (It's certainly not a songon the album.) Then out of nowhere Mike Myers of SNL comes onstage, drink in hand and duets with them on some obscure pop-punknugget with a chorus that goes "BBC 1! BBC 2! BBC 3! BBC 4! BBC 5!BBC 6! BBC 7! BBC Heaven!" Who knew?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
