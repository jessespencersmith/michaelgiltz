DVDs have been a game changer in so many ways: their great picture and sound has middle class
families flocking to flat screen TVs and surround sound systems. They've got people buildinglibraries of movies the same way they collect music albums and books. And just like those book andCD libraries, DVD libraries are bursting with massive boxed sets, the sort of thing people rarelypull out and watch (or read or listen to) but which they proudly display.
Now, next to the complete works of Mark Twain or Mozart or that Miles Davis boxed set (when all
you really listen to is Kind of Blue ), you can find Everybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series
($279.98; HBO) in a box shaped like a suburban home and collecting all nine seasons of thedurable sitcom. Unlike a serialized drama or miniseries, most sitcoms don't need to be seen instrict order. In fact, sitcoms usually shouldn't be watched in big batches. It tends to dull the fun. Sowhy would anyone buy this massive boxed set? Because it's a very good, sometimes great show;because watching them in order can be subtly more satisfying; and because putting it on your shelfsays, "I really liked this show!" Someone with the complete original Star Trek  or the complete
Benny Hill? Entirely different message.
Also just out is Season One of Flight of the Conchords
($29.98; HBO), which is perfect for people who don't
own HBO or just want to skip to the musical
numbers; and Melrose Place: Third Season  ($54.99;
Paramount), because if you don't watch every episode
of a soap in order, how will you remember who is
sleeping with whom? And thanks to DVDs, countless hours of TV memories that might have been
lost forever are rescued. Bob Hope's decades of TV specials are celebrated in Bob Hope: The
Ultimate Collection ($29.99; R2), a two disc set with nearly eight hours of highlights. Even better is
Here's Johnny: The Definitive DVD Collection ($99.99; R2), a 12 disc set that packs together four
previous collections in one massive box. It contains about 20 hours of well-chosen clips, which
sounds like a lot until you realize he delivered 4,500 hours of TV over the years.
But maybe the defining TV on DVD experience is to watch a classic serialized drama or miniseries.
And it doesn't get more classic than Fassbinder's epic 13 part German miniseries BerlinAlexanderplatz  ($124.95; Criterion), a work hailed as a masterpiece when it was shown in US

Fassbinder's masterpiece, presented with typical flair by Criterion with new documentaries, newsubtitles and even an earlier 1931 version of the same source novel.
Just as DVD has woken up the studios to the riches in their TV vaults, it's slowly dawning on the
people broadcasting sports that fans will fork over big bucks for DVDs celebrating their players'exploits. Stanley Cup Game 7 Collection  ($79.98; Warner Bros.) contains six complete Game 7s
(including the New York Rangers ending their 54 year drought in 1994) along with highlights fromevery other Game 7 ever played. Yankeeography Mega-Set  ($99.95; A&E) collects 34 complete
episodes of the Yankee biography series covering greats like Babe Ruth and Phil Rizutto to JoeTorre and Derek Jeter. (And no, Alex Rodriguez isn't included.) Wrestling fans have been showeredwith titles, including John Cena: My Life  ($34.95; WWE), a three disc set covering his entire
career, seven complete matches and a tour of his car collection. Even the dowdy world of tennis isslowly getting into the act: Wimbledon: The 2007 Official Film  ($24.99; Kultur White Star) misses
the mark with a rookie mistake: a 60 minute film for an event that covers two weeks and includeshundreds of hours of tennis? Wimbledon: The 2007 Men's Final ($24.99; Kultur White Star) is
much better: it contains the entire three hour and 45 minute match, the warm-ups, the pre-game
interviews, the trophy ceremony and so on. That 2007 Official Film  would have made a nice extra,
folks, not an entire film on its own. Finally, the DVD voom for sports has produced the lavish
America's Game: Super Bowl I-XL ($199.98; Warner Bros.), which collects 40 new one hour
documentaries on the first 40 Super Bowls. The effort put into this boxed set, which makes use of
the terrific archives from the NFL is superlative - and will be even more spectacular if and when it
comes out in HD. It's just one more example that with DVDs, sports fans have entered the
Promised Land.
Also out this week: Steven Spielberg's still-breathtaking classic Close Encounters Of The Third
Kind Ultimate Edition  ($39.95; Sony), which settles all arguments by properly providing every
version of the film out there, from the theatrical version to the final, final one Spielberg just signedoff on; The Charles Burnett Collection  ($39.95; Milestone), a faultless 2 disc set containing his
legendary debut Killer Of Sheep,  two versions of My Brother's Wedding, four shorts by Burnett
and more in an exemplary package; La Vie En Rose  ($27.95; HBO), the story of Edith Piaf
featuring a performance by Marion Cotillard as the Little Sparrow that is sure to be catnip to theOscars; the animated blockbuster Shrek The Third  ($29.99; DreamWorks), which will struggle to
get an Oscar nomination thanks to a terrific year for animated films; a real-life Gumball Rally in3000 Miles  ($19.99; Revolver) including Tony Hawk, who should know better, and Bam Margera,
who doesn't; Ocean's Thirteen  ($28.98; Warner Bros.), which is indeed better than Ocean's Twelve
if not quite as finger-snapping cool as Ocean's Eleven  but since that was far better than the
original Ocean's Eleven, they're still ahead of the game; director Oliver Smolders could give David
Lynch lessons in being odd, as proven with his feature debut Black Night  ($29.95; Cult Epics) and
his collection of shorts Spiritual Exercises ($29.95; Cult Films); the delightful fantasy The PrincessBride: 20th Anniversary ($19.98; MGM), which should be shared with your children after  you've
all read the classic novel together; the airless, brutal drama Flanders  ($26.98; Koch) and a peek
back at life in Duckburg, USA via DuckTales, Volume 3  ($34.99; Disney).
