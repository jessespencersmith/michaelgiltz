Ryan Seacrest said we had been waiting for it with bated breath. But it wasn't the Top 12 he was
referring to -- it was the set. "Say hello to our new set, America." Hello, set. Actually, it's animprovement but still not quite as flash as the set for Simon Cowell's UK equivalent "The XFactor." (I love how that show flashes the contestant's name all over the stage.) But the "mosh pit"where audience members can stand and groove along to the songs is a great addition. On thenegative side, why strand the bandleader on his own little alcove far away from the othermusicians? Stupid and dangerous when it comes to the subtle communication they need to adjuston the fly to a particular performance.
Ryan also said the Beatles -- I mean, "the Lennon/McCartney Songbook" (sorry, George) -- is
exciting because John Lennon and Paul McCartney are responsible for more Number One hitsthan any other songwriters. No one else is even close in the rock era. The Beatles alone had 20 #1hits so he may be right but I'm still checking. Ryan asked Simon if these songs were difficult andSimon said, "It depends which one you choose," with his usual blunt finality. Made perfect senseuntil he said if you chose "She Loves You" it's easy and if you choose "Yesterday," it's hard. Huh?Actually, "She Loves You" seems easy but has all sorts of tricky high parts if you really want tomake it work and "Yesterday" is a dead simple melody -- it's not one of the most covered tunes ofall time because it's super hard to sing, that's for sure.
Syesha Mercado  -- Sang "Got To Get You Into My
Life," which wasn't even released as a single till 1976,
long after the band disbanded. Earth, Wind & Fire
did a terrific cover two years later that also went Top
10 and Syesha took her cue from that, adding in lots
of horns. I didn't dig her hair and she had a very
rough start. But once she hit the chorus she got stronger and she ended very well. However, by theend of the show, when they did the recap I was a little startled to hear her because I'd totallyforgotten her performance. And I've got a crush on her! Always dangerous to be forgettable. But

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 12: The Beatles
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_91081.html [4/5/2009 7:28:27 PM]she had a strong ending. Randy was lukewarm, Paula said it was great from halfway through
onward and Simon was quite positive and might have given her enough of a boost to get her
through. It's never fun to go first.
Chikezie  -- Sang "She's A Woman," the B-side to "I Feel Fine" that didn't even appear on a UK
album (though it was on the thrown-together Beatles 65 in the US. Don't get me started about the
absurd chaos of the US versions of Beatles albums.) I'm a Beatles fanatic but why choose a song
that 98% of your audience won't even recognize? Even before he began I pegged his song choice as
a complete disaster -- when you've got one of the most well-known song catalogs in history, one
bursting with tremendous tunes, don't choose a relative rarity. Then he began singing. The
arrangement reflected the early skiffle days of the Beatles, with some banjo thrown in. (Has
Chikezie been listening to the terrific new Otis Taylor  album, Recapturing The Banjo? That's
where I learned the banjo came from Africa.) Then the song began rocking out and Chikezie was
looser, funkier and more entertaining than he'd ever been before. Just terrific. The only flaw in agreat moment was Ryan dancing around like a dork at the end, encouraging shenanigans andgenerally infantilizing Chikezie by rubbing his head. Help them look cool, Ryan. If they seem hyperfrom the adrenaline rush, help them get control. All three judges were wildly enthusiastic, ofcourse. His best performance yet.
Ramiele Malubay -- Sang "In My Life" from the landmark Rubber Soul album. Boldly, Ramiele
began the song on the stairs looking UP, kind of a fun change of pace that worked well, until shehad to get back down to the ground and wavered a moment on the steps. Too often, I've found heranonymous and a diva ready to throw in tons of trills and runs to no purpose. She still didn't showme a lot of personality. But for once she kept it simple and straightforward. Of course, she gotpilloried for that. Randy and Simon were bored and even Paula said she was waiting for some vocalgymnastics. Actually, no, we don't need another Mariah Carey. To top off the injustice, Simon eventhought the John Lennon classic was a boring song. Disastrous reviews. When all three judges slamyou, you are in serious trouble.
Jason Castro  -- Sang "If I Fell" with just an acoustic guitar, a so-so voice and a lot of charm. The
tune originally appeared on the A Hard Day's Night soundtrack in the UK and on Something New
in the US, serving as the B-side to "And I Love Her." (Told you I was a Beatles fanatic.) Lovely tuneand Jason coasted through, but he's very lucky a lot of people were worse than him. Very rough onthe high notes and at the end. But when Simon said it sounded like a student sitting in theirbedroom at midnight, a lot of fans thought, "Gee, that would be fun to be in a bedroom at midnightlistening to Jason sing." Sex appeal counts for a lot folks. Paula said, "I can feel your heart" andRandy was negative but Simon was vaguely positive. That and charm should keep him safe, butthose weak vocals will catch up with him in the end. If I'm not mistaken, Simon trashed this songtoo as dull; I know Simon can't handle Bob Dylan but does he hate the Beatles too?
Carly Smithson  -- Sang "Come Together" in a pretty traditional arrangement, despite promising
she would change things up. Lennon's last #1 hit with the Beatles, off their best-selling album
Abbey Road  (12 million copies and counting in the US.) I still don't like her piercing high notes
(they sound weak and a tad shrill to me) but this is a very good performance and I haven't been afan. I think to myself, "Gee, someone should give her a record deal. Oh, wait...." On top of thedeserved praise, Simon goes into overdrive for Carly, saying that she reminds him of KellyClarkson, who gave a breakout performance the same week in season one. Clearly, one of his goalstonight is to build up the other artists and stop making David Archuleta seem so inevitable oraudiences will get bored.
Before introducing David Cook, Ryan is seen leaning over whispering to Simon. Since he was
looking up at a monitor, I assume it was a planned bit of silliness. But no matter how many times Iplayed it back, I couldn't quite hear all of the first sentence. Ryan is whispering, "The crew thinksyou're..." and Simon rears back and says loudly, "No, I would NOT!" and then Ryan says, "No, butI think they think you're becoming obnoxious."
David Cook -- Sang "Eleanor Rigby," off Revolver , which combined with Rubber Soul  to send the
Beatles into the stratosphere creatively, setting them a galaxy apart from every other act. Cook
pulled the same stunt as last week, giving an emo makeover to another mellow ballad. It workedwell again and he ended very strongly on a rocker's yelp. But he can't pull the same trick again nextweek. And he still has that unintentional habit of looking very pleased with himself, that Daughtryattitude where he seems to be thinking, "I am such a badass for rockin' out on Idol ." Actually, you

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 12: The Beatles
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-to_b_91081.html [4/5/2009 7:28:27 PM]can't appear on Idol  and pretend you're a rebel. It's not possible. The judges loved it, rightly. Simon
insisted he was "brilliant" and said that if this were a talent contest instead of a singing contest
(take that, you popular little punk, David Archuleta), then Cook could win it all! One more stab at
not making the show seem a foregone conclusion. Both Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin sang the
heck out of this tune, though I'd give a slight edge to Brother Ray  if I had to choose.
Brooke White  -- Took off her shoes, sat down at the piano and sang "Let It Be." Nailed it. Do
Carly Simon and Carole King realize their love child is coming on strong on Idol ? The song is the
title track from their raw second to last album which broke down in recriminations. They then got
together to record their final album Abbey Road.  Producer Phil Spector stepped in and dug
through the tapes to come up with an album that was technically released last. And thedocumentary film showing their backbiting has unfortunately been held up for years; I've nevereven seen it. The judges fall over themselves in praise, even though Randy confuses poor Ramielleby praising Brooke for basically singing the song straight, just like she did. The difference? Brookedid a good job. Tearing up at the end of the song didn't hurt in the endearment department either.By the way, Ryan said this was the last single from the Beatles, but I believe it was actually "TheLong and Winding Road." (That ignores tunes released years later like "Got To Get You Into MyLife" and the patchwork job "Free As A Bird" and "Real Love" in '95 and '96.) Joan Baez was thefirst to have a hit covering this song, though I favor the great Bill Withers.
David Hernandez  -- Sang "I Saw Her Standing There" and looked cute with an untucked shirt
and tie but it was basically a train wreck. He ran out of breath while running in and out of the
audience and was weak on the low notes and the chorus. The tune was the B-side to the Beatles'breakthrough US hit "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and was a big hit for Tiffany, who changed thegenders. If he's gonna go down for this, I kind of hope he sings the Tiffany version when he saysgoodbye. But he shouldn't have to go; Hernandez has a great voice and I still thought he was sort ofentertaining. The judges trashed him -- even Paula.
Amanda Overmyer  -- Sang "You Can't Do That" from A Hard Day's Night  in the UK and The
Beatles' Second Album  in the US. Another relatively obscure choice that I immediately peg as bad.
She should be doing "Helter Skelter" or "Back In the USSR" or something tough but well-known.
So of course she delivers her best performance so far. I couldn't understand half the lyrics, but
that's standard operating procedure for Amanda. But it's a competent performance and the judges
loved her so she'll be fine. Most interesting of all: Amanda didn't change the gender of the song, so
she was singing, "If I catch you talking to that boy again" and "Well, it's the second time I've caught
you talking to him." Did Amanda just not bother changing the gender, was it too awkward to sing
"her," which wouldn't rhyme with "sin" in the next line? Or did Amanda just come out? (I don't
think so.)
Michael Johns  -- Sang "Across The Universe" nicely and simply. Despite one rock star moment of
lifting up his hands into the air, very controlled and emotional. His best since singing "Bohemian
Rhapsody" during Hollywood. And I havent' been a fan. The judges however were mostly bored.Randy and Simon poo-poo it, while Paula felt his heart. My favorite cover of this song was SeanLennon, Rufus Wainwright and Moby singing it at a Lennon tribute show in October of 2001, oneof the first events to be held in the wake of 9-11. Just beautiful.
Kristy Lee Cook  -- Sang "Eight Days A Week," y'all! She also do a sort of line-dance, riding-a-
bull sort of move while singing it. The second train wreck of the night, the song comes from Beatles
For Sale  in the UK and Beatles VI  in the US. Weak, anonymous vocals throughout and a very weak
final note and the judges body-slammed her.
David Archuleta  -- Sang "We Can Work It Out" and gave another brilliant performance. Huh?
You say it was a disaster? Sure he forgot the words and stumbled around. Heck, even before he
sang -- when the camera spotted him on that garganutan stage when going to commercial -- Ithought, "Gee, he looks young. And small." But the David Archuleta train was going to fast. You'vegot to stumble so you can recover and not be so boring that people just don't bother voting. SoDavid picked a perfect week to be just awful. If you wait too long and give your bad performancewhen there are only four or five people left, you might just get sent home. But doing it tonight,enough other acts were bad (but none worse) to guarantee that David will be given a free pass fromhis huge fan base and get to work his way back up to indomitable favorite. Smart thinking, David!How bad was he? The audience barely booed when Simon said David was awful. He also dredgedup some mannerisms from his Star Search  days, including a diva-like bobbing of the head and
those gospel singer hand gestures.  But how smart is he? David was forgetting the lyrics left and

right and nearing meltdown. So when the chorus began and the background singers started
singing, he let them go first and then came in behind so he could use them as a safety net to make
sure he was singing the right words Smart, smart, smart. A #1 hit for the Beatles, "We Can Work It
Out" was a single (backed by "Day Tripper") and only appeared on greatest hits compilations.
Stevie Wonder had a top 20 hit with it in 1973 but you can be certain it WON'T be on David
Archuleta's debut CD. He'll wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat trying to remember
the lyrics for weeks to come. But don't worry, David; your stumble came at just the right time. Now
your fans can start rooting for you again without feeling like they're cheering for the Yankees
during the Fifties.
So putting aside David Archuleta, the two worst performances of the night were David Hernandez
and Kristy Lee Cook. The two most boring performances of the night were Ramiele Malubay and
Syesha Mercado. Usually, boring is worse than bad because at least people remember the bad and
feel maybe a little sympathy. Simon really dropped the hammer on Ramiele and Kristy. I'm
probably crazy not to include David Hernandez, but I'm going to say the bottom two is Ramiele
and Kristy and in a nail-biter I say Kristy Lee Cook is going home.

Love your spot-on analysis every week, Mr. Giltz. And I'm also a big fan of Syesha. The woman simply
excudes sensuality, and she's not a half-bad singer either!
Hope you don't mind my making a few clarifications on Beatles trivia. Let it Be (b/w You Know My Name
-- now THAT would have made an interesting selection to cover) was in fact the last "official" Beatles
single, notwithstanding, as you mentioned, post-breakup releases circa 1976, Free As a Bird, etc. Let It
Be was released in March 1970, a month before the generally accepted breakup date of April 10. The
Long and Winding Road was a U.S-only 45 (b/w For You Blue) released in May 1970. 
Given that it's AMERICAN Idol, and that the show and the Beatle's American label, Capitol, are both
based in Hollywood, somewhat ironic on Ryan Seacrest's part to go with the British release dates and
album listings, i.e., You Can't Do That presented as "from (EMI-Parlophone's) A Hard Day's Night"
instead of Capitol's bogus Beatles' Second Album. But at least he was consistent throughout the show.
And one minor correction. Stevie Wonder's version of We Can Work It Out (along with Jimi Hendrix's
version of Day Tripper, my personal all-time favorite Beatles cover) was recorded and first released on
Stevie's Signed, Sealed & Delivered LP in 1970. It came out as a single in 1971, not 1973.
Thanks for the great blog. Looking forward to next week's entry. And evidently, due to popular demand,
they're extending the Lennon-McCartney songbook tribute for one more show. Fab!

One minor technical point, please. Michael Jackson didn't buy the Beatles catalog "at auction." He stoleit! -- by outbidding Paul behind Paul's back. Paul admits since that he obviously regrets giving a lowball
bid to ATV (the corporation that owned the "Northern Songs" which licensed a majority of the Lennon-
McCartney cannon) for the songs but, make no mistake, Jackson's was unscrupulous by buying the
rights out from under Paul, who (supposedly) was his friend at the time of the purchase back in the mid
'80s
Charity See Profile  I'm a Fan of Charity  permalink
So NOT impressed with Brooke or David Cook. Thought Cook screeched his way through the haunting
(when done by The Beatles, i.e. Paul McCartney on lead - incidentally, he wrote it, too) "Eleanor Rigby."And Brooke, can she sing any other way but in that style? I certainly don't think she deserves theOUTRAGEOUS praise that Simon gives her week after week. Very uncharacteristic of him. I also donot get Jason Castro. 
And Michael, while I enjoyed your column, "She's a Woman" was a big hit in Miami at the time it was
first released. Indeed, both "I Feel Fine" and "She's a Woman" got pretty much equal play at the time(I'm almost 60; saw the Beatles live at the Gator Bowl in "64.)
Additionally, "If I fell" is on my original soundtrack of Hard Day's Night, released in the U.S. at the time
of the movie. I have all the Beatles' albums on vinyl, bought at the time they were first released in the
U.S., including the ones not previously waxed on Capitol Records (Verve Records, I think - my albums
are packed in a box right now; I've recently moved or else I'd pull them out for reference.)
As for the film "Let it Be" I think I've seen it about three or four times - when each Beatle film was
released my friends and I always made sure we sat through as many showings as we could. Thosewere the days when you weren"t asked to leave the theater when the showing was over. "Let It Be"played, if memory serves, in the Shores Theater in Miami Shores, Florida, when it was first released in1970. And yeah, if I recall, you can cut the tension with a knife in some places. The gig on the roof alsofeatures Beatle women in the background as audience, if I recall - Yoko, Linda, Maureen. Yoko'spresence in the film was especially telling at the time and indicated that yes, indeed, the Beatles dreamwas over. (I am not a Yoko-hater, btw.)
DCDan See Profile  I'm a Fan of DCDan  permalink
Not Verve Records, that's strictly a jazz label. Most likely you're thinking of the VJ (aka "Vee-Jay") label, a long-defunct R&B label out of Chicago that released a couple Beatles LPs in theearly days of Beatlemania, including most famously "Introducing the Beatles" with the iconicDezo Hoffman sepia cover shot.
And I am, in fact, a Yoko-hater. Don't believe the revisionist post-Lennon assassination spin,
she WAS more singularly responsible than anyone else for breaking up the Beatles, more

either, in her narcissistic controlling of the estate and legacy of Lennon and her stake in the

dcdan, yes, Vee-Jay - couldn't recall it offhand. 
in regard to yoko, you're leaving out free-will on lennon's part. 
yes, yoko literally pushed her way into the life of john lennon (i'm also referring to
the anecdote of her pushing her way into his limo) but at any point he could havepushed her right back out, and, ostensibly, continued on as part of a singing/writing
four-some. but with two colliding egos the size of lennon and mccartney, the break
up was inevitable. 
at the time that all of this was going on, those of us out in "fan-land" didn't have
much of an idea as to how serious the situation had gotten; a lot of the intricatedetails were learned a step or two later, or in some cases, only to be divulged in the
books that were written several years later. i recall in 1970 during the break up of
reading a "rare" one-on-one interview with mccartney where he could barely contain
his contempt for lennon - and it was a real first glimpse as to how incredibly hatefulthey were to each other. i remember a friend and i discussing this along the lines of
"wow, we knew it was bad, but didn't realize how bad...." i most likely still have that
news article saved among my beatle memorabilia, boxed up with the rest of my
things. i used to save anything published about the beatles.
at any rate, i have long since given up any fan-hatred for yoko. perhaps if she had
come and gone in john's life, i would have thought more harshly of her. but she was,in the end and to the end, john's soulmate and from that came a burst of john's owncreativity and his penchant for riding on the razor's edge. 
also, please don't underestimate the effect linda eastman had on paul mccartney or
the effect eastern religion had on george. ringo always seemed to go along for theride. but all four men were distinct talents, with good and curious brains, and thebreak up their formative group was inevitable. 
yoko can be seen as the tear in the fabric to which john tore through to escape what
he - and paul - were both feeling as stultifying to both of their creative and personal
needs. i didn't like beatles break up either, but as a 45-years long fan i have long
since given up "hating" yoko ono for the "break up" of the beatles. it's time to get
over it.

Or maybe Amanda's boyfriend in 'You Can't Do That' is interested in another guy?

Good point. That's what she gets for dating a metrosexual.

Actually, the easiest and best sounding Beatles song to play on an acoustic guitar and sing it at the
same time is "You've got to hide your love away". The chord progression is really easy but soundsamazing. John's voice was in the middle of the register so it is also easy to sing.
After that I would pick "Here comes the sun" by George Harrison which is not as hard as it sounds and
this is perhaps the best sounding and easily most recognizable Beatles song. capo 7th fret.

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol Top 12: The Beatles

Harrison's " My Sweet Lord" is hard but sounds easy as you really have to build up your hand strength
to play that one. capo second fret
"The things we said today" is an easy song to sing and play but I don't think it was one of their best
songs.
"Give me Love" by George Harrison is one of my favorites and is not that tough to play although some
might find it so. capo third fret.
"Dear Prudence" perhaps one of Lennon's best ballads is difficult and most people might want to tune
their guitar down a whole step.
Best Regards,
G&M

"You've Got To Hide Yor Love Away" is easy to sing and play, but it's not easy to get that
little bit of swagger that makes the "Hey! You've got to hide your love a-way" actually work.
"Here Comes The Sun" is a brilliant song, easily one of my Top 5 but it and most of the others
you mention were George harrison tunes as you know and therefore not available whensinging the Lennon/McCartney songbook. "Dear Prudence" might have worked well for Jason,don't you think? Thanks for the perspective on what's easy on the guitar.

How do you sing Eight Days a Week as a country song and not be booted off? I'm amazed!

I'm bummed too. I think everyone thought she was the worst and she seemed to think shewas going home too. BUt unless you think Ramile or Kristy or David hernandez would win itall (and probably none of them would) it's wrong to get caught up on who goes first. If they'rethe bottom tier, it doesn't really matter about the order that much, even though week to weekit can seem like a travesty.

It kills me how these media critics even get a platform. They miss the biggest flawof the show. AT the end of the show Seacrest thanks everybody except the Beatles.Helloooo!!!!!

Or more specifically John Lennon and Paul McCartney since it was definitely NOT a Beatlesnight but a Lennon?McCartney night as they pointed out over and over again. Ryan couldand should have thanked Lennon and McCartney at the end, but they had made manyappropriate overtures to the genius of them, so I don't think it was too egregious. But it wouldcertainly have been a nice touch and I'm sure if you mentioned it to Ryan he would agree.

Simon was not up to par, either, dismissing In My Life as a boring song and thinking She Loves You isan easy one to pull off. Chikeze and Brooke were great. Quite simply, considering the material they hadto work with- regardless of their choices- the rest simply sucked. I Saw Her Standing There is a CarlPerkins-ish, not Chuck Berry rocker, no interpretation of it should be such a train wreck. But it's "not theonly one."

I wonder which Beatles song Danny would have sang? I liked Chikezie the best, he totally rocked.
Country Chick on the other hand, has to go. It sounded like a parody you would hear on The Simpson's
or something.

Ooops! I meant "The Simpsons," bad punctuation there.

Not to worry about the missing apostrophe. A minor flub given the standards of
spelling in a comments section. Danny liked to have fun, Maybe Ticket to Ride orLady Madonna?

Excellent review. Here is my review of last nights performances.
Keep "em Group (in no particular order)
1. Carly Smithson: Solid performance, excellent song choice.
2. David Cook: Powerful performance.
3. Chikezie Eze: He surprised everyone tonight with a very upbeat performance. Great energy.4. Brooke White: I loved her performance. She had tons of heart and you could feel it.5. Amanda Overmyer: She blew me away this week. I really enjoyed her. For once I disagree withSimon. It was better than last week.6. Michael Johns: I loved the song (Rufus Wainwright version. His vocals were solid, but it was a tad bitboring; however, he will be safe.7. David Archuleta: He said he was nervous about the song, he was, he forgot the words in thebeginning; twice. Still, he has excellent vocals, but not his best; however, he too will be safe thanks tothe media frenzy surrounding him. He showed that he is not a perfect performer.8. Syesha Mercado: Since she went first, she is the most forgettable. She has excellent vocals, but thesong and performance were a bit boring. I think she deserves to be there next week for sure.9. Ramiele Malubay: Her voice is amazing and she is adorable. Bad song choice. I hope she is backnext week.10. Jason Castro: I like him a lot. He is adorable. Last week was better. I was extremely distracted bythe clapping going on in the mosh pit and I had the feeling he was too. I felt as though the clapping was
throwing him off a bit. I don't think that AI should allow that sort of distraction again. It was painful to
watch and hear. Back to Jason...I think he had one of the weaker performances tonight; however, Ithink he will be safe because after all there were people worse. (See below).
Boot "em Group (in no particular order)1. David Hernandez: The performance seemed very karaoke to me. I was embarrassed for him. The
judges said it was overdone. I think he is a favorite to go home tomorrow night. 2. Kristy Lee Cook: The worst performance of the night  horrible, horrible. She turned the Beatles,
Eight Days a Week into a BAD country style song that verged on sounding like Polka music. I think sheshould get the boot or maybe even jail time for ruining that Beatles song. However, I think the countryfans might save her with dials. She was by far the most painful to watch tonight. Ugh!!!

Thanks for the rundown. I hope you're wrong about Hernandez but I tried to convince myself it

Why oh why do you pick songs where the real hook is in the interplay between Lennon and
McCartney's voices, where they switch off on who is technically singing melody and who is doingharmony: songs like If I Fell and We Can Work It Out. Bad, bad choices, especially when such obvioussolo choices like "You've got to hide your love Away", "ticket to ride" (both off the under appreciatedHelp!) were left alone.
The real shame is that no one did anything truly daring, which is what the Beatles should be best
remembered for: Tommorow Never Knows, I am the Walrus, and the song that invented hard rock, the
above-mentioned Helter Skelter: and why not introduce it like Bono: "This is a song Charles Mansonstole from the Beatles-- we're stealing it back." Would it have been too meta to wear the Manson t-shirtlike Axl Rose in the video for "Estranged"? 
The real tragedy? That they could only do Lennon/McCartney stuff, leaving perhaps some of the
greatest songs the Beatles EVER did, like "Something," the always overlooked "Old Brown Shoe" or"While My Guitar Gently Weeps." The difference? Harrison owned all his own publishing, while the
Lennon/McCartney stuff was bought at auction by Michael Jackson. Ever notice how whenever you
hear a news story about MJ having money trouble, in the ensuing months you get a lot more Beatles
songs being licensed in commercials, etc?

They could have done "A day in the LIfe". I can play that on my acoustic guitar. It's not hard
and it's a real hoot!
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I kind of thought Michael Johns might tackle "I Am The Walrus." You make a great point
about how dangerous it is to pick songs where the Lennon-McCartney vocals intertwined andplayed off each other. Still, I think the songs are great enough that you could do a final soloversion of say "If I Fell," it's just that Jason Castro has a very thin voice no matter what he'ssinging. I kind of hoped Amanda would do "Helter Skelter" or even "Why Don't We Do It InThe Road," just for shock value. "Old Brown Shoe" is a charmer, right up there with "Two Of
Us" in the small category of overlooked Beatles songs.

Ah. Damn good songs, all! I wonder if they had all these songs to choose from, and
if they get to listen to them done by the Beatles before they choose? Some of theyounger kids might not be that familiar with the more bizarre, less well-knownBeatles music... But you mention some great choices! (Do it in the road - one of myfaves!)
