Hard on the heels of her 
last' b~stseller, Anita " 
Shreve is poised to top 
,the charts again 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
When writer Anita Shreve 
was a little girl, she'd curl 
up on the.' floor of her 
Dedham, Mass., library and 
devour the "Oz" books of L. Frank 
Baum. 
"They were these' big, thick, 
dusty books;" remembers Shreve, 
who believes, "Everybody has a 
key that opens up [their interest 
in books] and that was it for me." 
That key love of books has led 
Shreve far -trom submitting 
poetry, when she was in grade 
school, to the kid's magazine 
Jack & Jill, (she was aJways 
turQ!:!d down) to her seventh 
novel, "Fortune's Rock~." 
Coming on the heels of Shreve's 
last novel, "The Pilot's Wife" -
an Oprah Book Club selection 
that's sold more than 2 million 
copies :-her latest is poised to 
become her biggest. 
A fearlessly romantic story, it tells the tale of Olympia, 
a mature-beyond-her-years 15-
year-old growing up in New 
Hampshire in 1899. Educated 
by her father, Olympia is only 
dimly aware of how privileged 
and unique her life is' until 
it's all destroyed by a reckless 
affair with John Haskell" a 42-
year-old married man' and friend 
of the family. 
Like most of Shreve's books, 
"Fortune's Rocks" has a 
compelling narrative. Still, critics 
seem leery of Shreve's 
accessibility. , They know her 
work is too well-written to 
dismiss, but can't shake, off the 
notion ,that important fiction 
should' be more difficult to read. 
Regardless, Shreve is more 
interested in,-the many readers 
, who tell her they' stayed up all 
night with one of her novels. 
"I love a -good story," says·' the 
52'-year-old author, adding; "I 
want to be lost in a story. I want it to be something that during 
the day I think, 'I can't wait to 
get back to that.'" 
But giving fans sleepless nights 
seemed unlikely when Shreve 
began. "I started out writing 
short stories in obscure literary , stories]. So I became a 
journalist." 
She still remembers her first 
byline, some 25 years ago. "I 
wrote a piece for 'the Boston 
Ph~nix and I 'was paid $60. The 
story was about this experience 
I had being' a plant consultant , 
and having lio idea what I was 
doing. I can remember to this day 
when they caned to accept the 
story. I hung up the phone and 
literally jumped off the grOUnd.'" 
She later wrote for an English~ 
langUage magazine in Nairobi, 
where her then-husband was­
attending graduate school, and 
returned to the States to write 
for several magazines. Shreve 
realized her shortcomings, 
though, as a reporter. "It made 
me uncomfortable to ask people 
questions they'd rather' not 
,answer. -And ,that was key," she 
laughs., ' , 
Other journalists, 
-however, aren't 
quite so shy. Many 
, leapt -~ conclusions 
concerning _ ' her 
,last ,novel, "The 
, Pilot's Wife" about 
a woman whose 
husband dies iii a 
When 
'he 'might 
coinmitted ' 0"' "!-""U""; 
she finds out the 
. truth ~ he had had 
another wife 'and 
family. Shreve was 
perturbed ' when 
reporters asked her 
if the book ,was 
based on her own 
, 'father, a former airline pilot. {It 
_ ,wasn't, she says.) . 
journals," she, says modestly, 
failing to menj;ion that on~ of 
her first stories' snagged a 
prestigious O'Henry Award. "Yes; 
I did do that:'. But it quickly 
became apparent you cou.1dn't' 
make a living -[writing short, Nevertheless, the similarity 
between her book and tlie 
unfolding suicide 'theory linked to 
EgyptAir flight 990 has left the 
writer :"shakeil~ -really upset," she ' 
says. "It's one thing to imagme it 
and quite another-thing to hear 
that it's actually hap~ned."</p>
