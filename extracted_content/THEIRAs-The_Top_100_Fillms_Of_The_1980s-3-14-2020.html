THE IRA AWARDS -- THE TOP 100 FILMS OF
THE 1980s
The IRAs gathered together in the midst of a pandemic. Now that's
devotion to cinema! Eight were present and two more wisely skipped
the hugs and kisses and buffet line by taking part via the internet.
(Using Zoom if you're interested in the details.) Aaron positioned
himself behind two classic movie posters while Greg went high-tech
with an ever-changing backdrop of his choice
(which paid dividends during his tribute to "E.T.: The Extra-
Terrestrial") Our host Alex provided a lovely buffet dinner and alcohol
in copious amounts. For those attending digitally, the exclamations of
pleasure over the banana pudding procured by Andy was especially
hard to bear.
Like all group votes, the list is inherently compromised. Not one group
of movies from the bottom ten even to the top ten was immune from
someone disparaging a film and wondering why it was on the list at all.
Despite having four films on the list, Woody Allen suffered repeated
blows...as a director! The even number of voters meant some ties could
not be broken on the big night, so certain films share a slot and are
presented alphabetically.
Months of debate, along with watching and re-watching of films led to
the Master List, which was then voted on to come up with the final 100,
locked into groups of ten (91-100, 81-90 and so on up to the Top Ten.)
On the big night, we voted on each group of ten. Some scandalously
wondered why we bother -- the movies don't move around that much
and most remain almost exactly where they were. But the final vote led
to a new movie at the top, a new movie at the bottom, and in seven out
of the ten groups a new film took over the top spot for that section.
Each member would quickly steer you away from this entry and urge
you to see that entry (which should have been higher!). But anyone
looking to see a significant chunk of 1980s films can rest assured the
one hundred films listed here are worth your time.
And so the IRAs are pleased to present:
