8/05/2005 11:28:00 AMThank God! The first response to the idiotic and chilling NYTop-ed column attacking evolution by Cardinal Schonborn hasfinally arrived. No surprise: it comes from a Jesuit. TheIndependent in the UK has the story about a column blastingthe Cardinal's fear of science and knowledge that appears inthe British Catholic newspaper The Tablet.In an article with explosive implications for the Church,Father George Coyne, an American Jesuit priest who is adistinguished astronomy professor, attacks head-on theviews of Cardinal Christoph Shonborn, the Archbishop ofVienna and a long-standing associate of Joseph Ratzinger,the German cardinal who was elected as Pope Benedict XVIin April....In The Tablet he says that Cardinal Shonborn's article has"darkened the waters" of the rapport between Church andscience, and says - flatly contradicting the cardinal - thateven a world in which "life... has evolved through a processof random genetic mutations and natural selection" iscompatible with "God's dominion".For a Vatican official of such seniority openly toattack the views of a cardinal on such a potentiallyexplosive subject as evolution is unprecedented. Italso reveals a deep rift at the heart of the CatholicChurch's thinking. It is known that Fr Coyne wroteprivately to both Cardinal Shonborn and the Pope himselfprotesting against The New York Times article soon after itwas published last month. But it is understood that somany scientists, especially Catholic scientists, havesince contacted him to express their disquiet, that hefelt he had to go public....The key question behind the debate is the opinion of newPope. Some fear that the cardinal would never havepublished such a controversial article in such a prominentmedium without his personal approval. But nothing will beknown for certain until the Pope speaks for himself.I know some of you think that "religion is crazy, so why do you stillpay attention." But the simple fact is that billions of people follow anorganized religion. They are a fact of life and a force in the world --people of faith need to push to make certain they're a force for good.This battle will help determine that for the Catholic Church and it'sone war I heartily endorse. The hearts -- and especially minds -- ofCatholics are at stake. After this, we'll move on to the malarkey aboutinterfering in elections and telling public officials who must faithfullyrepresent non-Catholics how to vote.
