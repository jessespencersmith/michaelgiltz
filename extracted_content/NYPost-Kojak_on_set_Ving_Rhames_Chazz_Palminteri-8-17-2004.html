, By MICHAEL GILTZ 
TORONTO, Canada -
Just a few blocks 
from a downtown 
police station in To­
ronto, a new poHce sta­
tion has sprung up in an 
old school administra­
tion building. 
It's the main set for 
"Kojak," a TV movie cur­
rently shooting and 
scheduled to air on the 
red-hot USA network in 
January. 
In a classic "Kojak" 
scene, the detective who 
i 'Kojak' return has 
a familiar Ving to it 
is always ready to break 
the rules is being taken to 
school by'a former part­
ner, now his boss, Frank 
McNeil. The show gets 
all the New York authen­
ticity it needs from its 
lead actors. Ving Rhames 
of Harlem is the bald, fedora-wear­
ing detective, and Bronx­
born Chazz Palminteri is 
McNeil. 
Yep, the classic New 
York detective -loved 
by cops in the 70s for re­
alistically depicting po-
lice work -is still 
bald and hands out 
the occasional 101-
lipop_ But 
Rhames, an ex­
ecutive producer on the movie, 
isn't coasting on a few 
props and signature tag­
lines. 
"I'm really focused on 
the humanity of the char­
acter," says the 
45-year-old actor, tossing 
his fedora on a police . 
desk in a corner of the 
set. "I'm playing a man 
who happens to be a de­
tective. It's trying to put 
the camera inside the 
man ... Which I think is 
much more interesting 
than doing a movie about 
'cops.' 
"I've got two children, 
and it's part of my job to 
make this world a better 
place before I leave the 
planet -if for nothing 
else than for the children, 
for my children. I think 
this is where Kojak is 
coming from, and he hap­
pens to do it through 
NYPD." 
That's why we see 
Kojak staying up all 
night, pouring over the 
evidence in a case in­
volving a serial killer 
who targets prostitutes 
with kids. As the sun­
rise floods his office, 
Kojak's eyes are 
opened to a crucial 
bit of evidence. But 
for Rhames, the 
concerns of 
Kojak are more 
than solving 
the case­
even if the 
detective 
will do 
whatever 
it takes to 
accom­
plish that. 
"He is a 
man who cares about the death of 
hookers, the death of any­
one," says Rhames, who 
shot to fame as a menac­
ing tough guy in "Pulp 
Fiction." 
"But he's also a guy who 
does something that one 
has to question: Do the 
ends justify the means? 
He's very imperfect. Yet 
he deals with two kids 
who lose their mother to 
a crime. He deals with 
their father in prison. 
An<;l Kojak helps get their 
fatlier out of prison." 
From "Charlie's An­
gels" to "Mission: Im­
possible," the re-inven­
tion of vintage TV shows 
is practically a cottage in­
dustry now. But when 
word got out last month 
that "Kojak" was being re­
made -with a black . 
actor in the title role -it 
made headlines. 
For Palminteri, it's that 
unexpected depth to the 
new Kojak that will win 
fans to this new movie. 
"Ving puts a spin on it 
that is really his own," 
says Palminteri, 52. 
"It's that quality you see 
of him in movies: He can 
be very tough and very 
mean, and then he can be 
extremely likable, and 
then he can be very 
funny. It's all those quali­
ties in an actor you want 
to see, especially in tele­
vision." 
Both no-nonsense guys 
clicked immediately. 
Rhames mentions their 
faith as one reason (Palm­
interi is a serious Catho­
lic), while Palminteri 
talks about their similar 
roots. 
"Ving called me himself 
anq told me he really 
wanted me to do this," 
says Palminteri. "We both 
come from the street, 
very meager as far as 
monetary things. We both 
come from the same 
yolk."</p>
