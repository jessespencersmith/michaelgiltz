Doctor Who: The 
Complete First 
Series ***'/, BBC Video. $99.98 
THE cult classic BBC show 
about a time-traveling Time 
Lord (Christopher Eccleston) 
gets a terrific reboot in this 
new series. The Doctor sur­
vives yet another sidekick and 
the return of the Daleks -
plus. there are even decent 
special effects. (The original 
was wonderfully cheap and 
cheesy.) Loads of extras 
include a good making-of. 
Too expensive, though. 
The Ubertine 
*'/, 
Weinstein. $28.95 
WHY do handsome movie 
stars love to make themselves 
look as ugly as possible? Sure­
ly Johnny Depp would have 
been more effective in this 
turgid period drama if he'd 
wallowed in his prettiness. 
Sometimes quirkiness works 
(as in "Pirates of the 
Caribbean") and sometimes 
it's a train wreck (as it is 
here). Modest extras include 
a director commentary. 
Charlie's Angels: 
Third Season 
** Sony, $49.95 
WHAT better way to cele­
brate the passing of TV leg­
end Aaron Spelling than to 
dive into the silly pleasures of 
"Charlie's Angels"? Season 
Three includes episodes with 
fallen angel Farrah Fawcett. 
plus Cheryl Ladd wrestling an 
alligator, a somewhat Sapphic 
spa, and guest stars like Dean 
Martin and Jamie Lee Curtis. 
Jiggle TV was never better. 
The Matador 
*'/, 
Miramax. $28._95 __ _ 
PIERCE Brosnan has fun 
tweaking his James Bond 
image playing a washed-up 
assassin for hire. But he did it 
better in "The Tailor of Pana­
ma." Greg Kinnear is too con~ 
vincingly boring as a bland 
suburban salesman . And the 
big twist at the end makes 
absolutely no sense. Extras 
include deleted scenes and 
commentary from the actors. VI
