BIBLICAL LITERALISM: A GENTILE HERESY
By John Shelby Spong
$26.99 (hardcover); HarperOne
He's not done yet.After a lifetime of struggle, a lifetime of fighting for justice for women and people of color and the queer
community, a lifetime of fighting to reclaim Christianity from guilt and prejudice and restoring compassion andlove at the heart of its message, Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong  surely earned his retirement in 2000.
But retirement  from his official role in the Episcopal Church has not meant retirement from study and reflection
and public advocacy. Spong uses his personal website  and blog to offer commentary and a glimpse of the
ideas he is grappling with. A best-selling author, he continues to publish a string of well reviewed books thatpopularize cutting edge scholarship alongside his own insights. Spong is also a popular speaker, giving two
BookFilter: Bishop John Shelby Spong Takes On Biblical Literalism In His Latest Work</p>
<p>talks in Illinois on Saturday, April 9 with more scheduled throughout the summer.  (One talk is in Peoria  and the
other in Springfield .) Still, retirement does have its benefits, such as fewer death threats.
Spong believed his memoir (2001's Here I Stand ) would be the last book he wrote. Yet the books keep
coming. Case in point? Biblical Literalism: A Gentile Heresy.  Booklist echoes many others when it says,
"Delightedly publishing another book as he nears 85, Spong returns to a main theme of his career, the
Jewishness of Christianity...vibrantly accessible."
Indeed, on one level Biblical Literalism  is a loving look at the Gospel of Matthew. Spong emphasizes that of
course it was written by Jewish writers for a Jewish audience and was first heard in Jewish worship. By
placing the Gospel over the calendar of worship for Jews at the time it was written (an issue of some debate),Spong shows the work "clicking" into place. The eccentricities, the purpose of so many passages becomecrystal clear when seen from this perspective. It's an insight he readily acknowledges was pioneered by manyothers, including the scholar Michael Goulder. Yet for a layperson unfamiliar with trends in Biblicalscholarship, it's a revelation. Indeed, first discovering this truth was a life-changing experience for him.</p>
<p>On a second level, Spong takes up the thread of another burning issue by emphasizing again and again the
dangers of Biblical literalism.  In his lifetime, Spong has seen so many of the key issues he championed
triumph, from basic civil rights for people of color to equality for women to the growing acceptance of thequeer community as welcome members of society and Christianity. Yet he is still driven to push forward onthe many issues that remain, from economic justice to seeing the equality of women recognized everywhereto the fight against war. Above all, indeed central to those battles is the struggle for the soul of Christianity, asoul he sees as poisoned by a desire to claim absolute truth and a Biblical literalism that leads to a religion ofpunishment and control and guilt and shame, rather than a faith of love and compassion and joy.
Spong's journey is a remarkable one. He began with a childhood raised in fundamentalism in the heart of the
Bible Belt and grew into a questioning young man. Later, Spong became a major figure in the EpiscopalChurch and society at large, challenged as little better than a heretic by some and receiving death threats fromothers. He's often portrayed as advocating ideas that would destroy Christianity. To Spong he's striving to</p>
<p>save it, just as rejecting fundamentalism saved his own faith.
Spong thinks perhaps Biblical Literalism  might be his last book. His wife Christine would happily agree. After
many years of marriage, he still refers to her sweetly as "my bride." Central to the work he accomplishes, she
jokes that even if he's up for another book, she may not be. (On the other hand, one suspects she may havealso said that four or five books ago.) In any case, Spong will be heard, whether giving talks  or weighing in
online,  Spong found his voice speaking for those who were silenced and he won't stop now.
