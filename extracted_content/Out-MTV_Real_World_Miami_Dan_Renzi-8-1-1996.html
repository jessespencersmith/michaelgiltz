To Be Real 
"I'M GOING TO BE THE MOST FAMOUS GAY GUY IN AMERICA!" jokes Dan Renzi, who's looking forward 
to the attention his part in the fifth season of MTV's The Real World is sure to bring. (New episodes air 
on Wednesday at 10 p.m. and are rebroadcast on Saturday and Sunday.) Of course he's looking 
forward to it. Why else would Dan-the show uses only first names-agree to live in Miami for five 
months with a houseful of strangers and let cameras record every argument, every discussion, and 
every moment of silliness? 
One such moment: Dan sits in the middle of the living room and sings ''I'm a Little Teapot" at the top 
of his lungs. "And one day we were playing Truth or Dare," he remembers, "and I somehow went from 
not wanting to play at all to marching around the living room in a pair of red bikini underwear shaking 
my genitals back and forth so Cynthia could watch them move." Along with Cynthia, Dan lived with two 
"really cool white guys," Joe anq Mike, and three other girls-including Flora, whom Dan describes 
warmly as "one of the most complicated and self-destructive people that I've ever met in my life." 
And Truth or Dare isn't all they'll see, since Dan also models, writes articles for the local magazine 
Ocean Drive, turns 22 years old, and dates Johnny. "My parents are going to see me kissing this guy," 
Dan says. "And not only my parents but the Ku Klux Klan is going to see it, Bob Dole is going to see it, 
every single person who has ever hated me for whatever reason is going to see it. And yeah, 
WORLOYIEW: Renzi they could change the channel, but the chances are that they won't." 
is olll on MTV. Dan was happily surprised to realize that going on The Real World was the best thing he 
could have done for his parents. He says they changed (rom "don't ask, don't tell the neighbors" 
to being more supportive than ever. "They showed up during the show," Dan recalls, amazement in his 
voice, "and I have no idea what happened to them still, but they were like boosters for PFLAG." 
A "Midwestern mutt" who grew up mostly in Kansas, Dan vividly remembers being "glued to the 
screen" during high school when openly bisexual Norman Korpi appeared on the first edition of The 
Real World. Lesbian Beth A. joined the second Real World season midway through, and late gay AIDS 
education activist Pedro Zamora appeared in the third season. While Dan loves the prospect of having 
the same positive impact on someone else, he also tries to keep his role in perspective . "Every time I did 
something wrong I thought, Oh, God, I've just dealt a vicious blow to my people! I became so paranoid 
sometimes about screwing up because of the sociological implications, when what I should really have 
been worried about was that I just looked like a dumb ass."-MICHAE L GI LTZ
