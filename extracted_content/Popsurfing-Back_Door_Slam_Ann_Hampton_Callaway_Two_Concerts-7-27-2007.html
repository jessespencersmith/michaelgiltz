            <p>F R I D AY,  J U LY  2 7 ,  2 0 0 7Two Concerts; Two RevelationsI went to two shows last night. The first was an electric blues bandcalled Back Door Slam performing at the Mercury Lounge. Theirpublicist urged me to check them out. Usually, I let publicists play the"you've got to see this" card once or twice a year. Some try to use it withevery single project and you learn to ignore them. Others know they'llearn your trust if they play that card only when they really mean it.This publicist had probably never really pushed me to see an act before,so I gave it a shot.My friend Noam and I arrived and went back to the concertarea...which was virtually empty. We sat on the couch along the wall asa few people wandered in for their 8 p.m. set. I said, "Wouldn't it be funif they blew us away?" And darned if they didn't. The three kids Ithought were techies were in fact the band. All of them about 21, withthe lead singer Davy looking like he was still in high school. While theywere still goofing around before the show, the bassist tickled the leadsinger from behind, who jumped five feet in the air and then theylaughed and he offered a hug which the bassist mock accepted but thenwalked away before delivering. Then they wandered onstage and thesweet looking Davy (who looks like he should be starring on a show onNickelodeon) started singing and out of his mouth leaped the voice of a60 year old blues singer, confident, raspy, commanding and electric.His guitar playing was equally assured. They performed some originals,a cover of Cream and Jimi Hendrix, a 30s blues number I didn't catchand all of it was just a blast. Davy indulges in some flashy pyrotechnics,but if you can't do that when you're 21, when the heck can you? Butthey were very, very disciplined and like all promising blues acts, youcan only assume they'll deepen and get even better over the years. Thenext coming of Stevie Ray Vaughan? An absolutely earned comparisonafter seeing them live. The bassist had some seriously long fingers andwas delightfully unperturbed throughout the show -- a real rock, justlike the drummer. This is a really good power trio I wouldn't hesitate torecommend to anyone looking to have sweaty, rowdy fun right now.(Wear ear plugs; they do!) And their potential is sky high. Here'shoping these three guys stay and play together for a long time to come.I followed Back Door Slam (which sounds like gay slang for giving yourNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
