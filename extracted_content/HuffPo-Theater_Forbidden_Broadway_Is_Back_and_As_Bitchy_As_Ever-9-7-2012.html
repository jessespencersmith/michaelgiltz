 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Forbidden Broadway" Is
Back and As Bitchy As Ever
FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: ALIVE & KICKING
*** out of ****47TH ST. THEATRE
After three years away sharpening its claws and waiting
for fresh meat like Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark  and
Newsies  to appear, Forbidden Broadway  is back with a
revue that pokes delicious fun at the Great White Way.
It's an institution created by Gerard Alessandrini more
than 30 years ago, one so beloved by the community iteven won a special Tony Award. And somehow I neversaw it. The same was true of the original Fantasticks ,
which ran and ran and ran and ran and then it closed and I said, "Darn! I should have seen that!" (No, Ihaven't seen the revival either , though I imagine Forbidden Broadway  had fun with that beloved musical
playing at the Snapple Theatre.)
Happily, after hearing about it for all these years, Forbidden Broadway: Alive & Kicking  is exactly what I
expected: it takes wicked shots at some shows, highlights the foibles of actors who can't sing, bemoans
the commercialization of Broadway, offers up amusing impersonations of famed stars but darn it, no
matter how hard they try to be mean-spirited, their love of theater and the frustrating, egotistical,
talented, wonderful people who put it on shines through.

<p>Before we get to the zingers, I'll say that Alessandrini is in fine form (though of course, I've nothing to
compare it to). The ratio of hits to misses is strong and the overall creativity solid. It never became off the
charts funny (except for a few moments) but it was never dull either. You don't need to have seen the
shows to enjoy the parodies; indeed, as I'm certain many critics have said before, going to see Forbidden
Broadway  is probably a lot more fun than most of the new shows that come and go each season.
Alessandrini wrote everything and directed alongside Phillip George. David Caldwell (the talent behind
the promising musical Gotta Getta Girl ) is back behind the piano as musical director.
The costumes by Philip Heckman and wigs by Bobbie Cliffton Zlotnik are inventive on a dime (and maybethe cast is all alone backstage, but if someone is helping them quick change from one outfit to the next,
they are probably the hardest working person there). All four cast members are game and genial, but it
must be said that the women outshine the men throughout and Jenny Lee Stern shines brightest (though
Natalie Charle Ellis  came on strong in the second act.
Most Broadway performers can probably enjoy the gentle and not-so-gentle ribbing of ForbiddenBroadway  but I doubt the vocally challenged Elena Roger of Evita  will be stopping by anytime soon.
Stern is hilarious here, though the target is such a slam dunk (Roger literally couldn't sing her role and
seemed to disappear even when onstage for minutes at a time) that Alessandrini couldn't have missed
with this one if he tried. No wonder it's the first dart tossed; knowing that the tune "Buenos Aires"
repeats over and over that Evita has "star quality" (the very thing Roger lacks) makes this almost tooeasy. But what puts it over is Stern's hilarious enunciation of every lyric, though Marcus Stevens  sets the
tone for the guys by being an amiable but soft-focused Ricky Martin, goofy a la most improv but notquite dead-on.
He does better teasing Matthew Broderick for barely being able to dance in a musical (back surgery didn't
help) and here Marcus does a terrific vocal zinger on Broderick's speaking voice.
A spoof on Annie  called Granny  doesn't really land (okay, so it's a 35 year old musical; so what?), but
like every other number here, it's put over with energy and is soon over: more than 20 shows (and a TV
show) get spoofed here in under two hours (including an intermission) so in the tradition of the BorschtBelt, if you don't like a joke, just wait a minute and another one will be along soon to take its place.
The mocking of the serious Once  (my favorite musical of last year) was fun, with star Steve Kazee's
singing another example of finding an actor's quirk and exploiting it for amusement; it's a highlight of
Scott Richard Foster's  night. That was followed by Ellis and her broad vocal range used to marvelous
effect in "Feed The 'Burbs," a naughty spin on Mary Poppins  and the tourist trade. Ellis was even better
in another highlight, the full-on hilarious sketch surrounding Porgy & Bess  (I mean, The Gershwin's
Porgy & Bess ), with Ellis spot-on doing Audra McDonald both vocally and as an actress.
There were lulls too: the finale involved The Book Of Mormon  but I don't think Alessandrini cracked that
code yet; the South Park  guys clearly mock themselves along with everyone else and the idea that they
disdain Broadway and its traditions doesn't fly (especially since one of the songs the show spoofs -- "I
Believe" -- is itself a loving send-up of "I Have Confidence" from The Sound Of Music ).
But no matter. The evening is fun and breezy and the temptation to return in six months or a year and
see what they're teasing next is understandable. Especially if Jenny Lee Stern  is still in the show. She
does an hilarious Patti LuPone (alongside Stevens as Mandy Patinkin), nails The Jersey Boys,  Bernadette
Peters and pretty much everyone else in her path. Saturday Night Live  should jump on her talents right
away.

Fern Siegel: Stage Door: Forbidden Broadway
There is cause for celebration -- after a three-year hiatus, Forbidden Broadway is back. One can almost
hear strands of Gypsy in the background: "You'll be swell, you'll be great." And it is. Proving you can't
keep a good parody down, "Like Jesus and Judy, we're resurrected."
