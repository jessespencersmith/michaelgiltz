9/08/2005 06:55:00 PMWe've seen it time and time again: Bush cronies fail miserablyand get rewarded. Now we're seeing it right here in America.Bush and his cronies say we can't start the "blame game"because America faces huge challenges in New Orleans. Uh, ifthe people in charge are incompetent, unqualified and havefailed spectacularly, surely we should replace them withqualified professionals so those massive challenges can befaced. USA Today has had enough and blasts the cronyism atFEMA in an editorial. And this outrage happened on Bush'swatch:But a deeper review of the agency's history, the records ofits top managers and internal memoranda reveal fardeeper problems than a momentary burst of poordecisions. Over the past four years, the Bushadministration has replaced competent leaders withpeople long on political connections but short ondisaster management expertise. At the same time, thewar on terrorism has drained the agency's resources andreduced its effectiveness.Katrina would have been devastating regardless, but thoseactions turned FEMA into something akin to New Orleans'famous levees — a structure sure to fail when a big disasterstruck.It's very simple. Bush shoved out the professionals doing their joband put in hacks who aren't even remotely qualified. It's costinnocent Americans their lives and Bush doesn't care. If he did, he'dfire the people responsible and hire people who would at least have achance of doing the job right.
