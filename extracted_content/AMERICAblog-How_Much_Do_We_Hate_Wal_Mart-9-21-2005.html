9/21/2005 01:55:00 AMYes, they were more efficient than Bush in getting help topeople after Katrina, but that doesn't mean we have to love'em. Canada knows how to stand up to this behemoth. Workersin the Quebec city of Jonquiere hoped to be the first NorthAmerican Wal-Mart employees to unionize. When they lookedpoised for success...surprise! Wal-Mart shut the store down,something it rarely does. Coincidence? Please. And now thecourts have ruled against it. So how much do we hateWal-Mart? Probably not as much as Wal-Mart hates Quebecright now.
