8/16/2005 08:44:00 PMUSA Today described that rancher harassing Cindy Sheehanwith shotgun blasts as "a little excitement." And now Bush'sneighbors are running over crosses erected as memorials tofallen soldiers? That is outrageous. I don't care what politicalgroup you belong to. Trashing CROSSES - and crosses devotedto our dead in Iraq -- is unconscionable.How does Bush feel about his neighbors? Does he support orcondemn trashing of memorials devoted to the soldiers whodied in Iraq? He couldn't be bothered to go to a single funeralor even the mass memorial in Ohio. Bush didn't even bother tosend a representative. And now his neighbors are running overcrosses placed in remembrance of those soldiers. If he doesn'tget angry and condemn these despicable acts, isn't he tellinghis neighbors to keep it up? And any paper that downplays thisas some sort of prank is crazy. If Cindy weren't on the left, FoxNews would lead with this every hour on the hour for days.Imagine someone on the left RUNNING OVER CROSSES. Whereis the outrage?
