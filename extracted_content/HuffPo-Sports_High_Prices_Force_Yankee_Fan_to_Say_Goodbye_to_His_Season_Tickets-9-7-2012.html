 Inspiring Funny Typical Scary Outrageous Amazing Infuriating ExtremeHigh Prices Force Yankee Fan to Say
Goodbye to His Season Tickets
I'm a season ticket holder with the New York Yankees,
happily enjoying the best -- and cheapest -- seats in thehouse in the bleachers. Ticket prices have doubled for
those seats in three years and I just got off the phone
with the Yankees asking for a few more days to scrapetogether money for the post-season package (which theygraciously granted.) And there in my email box is aheartbreaking letter from a fellow Yankee fan, a fatherwho brought his son to countless games to share the joy
of the game, exactly the sort of every-day fan you want
to be coming to the Stadium again and again. And hehad to let his season tickets go. Here's the letter he sent
out:
Dear New York Yankees,
My son and I have decided to give up our season tickets to the Yankees.
It was an obvious decision in many ways, but not an easy one. After all, my son and I have been sitting
together in the bleachers for the past 11 years -- since he was fourteen, to be exact.
Over those years we saw some of the most memorable moments in Yankee history, including the home
run in October of 2003 that sent the Yankees to The World Series and their hated rivals, The Boston RedSox, back to Bean Town with mud on their faces. Then there was the beautiful June evening in 2004
when Derek Jeter dove into the stands to catch a foul ball and end a rally that would have cost them the
game and a three game sweep -- again, against their pals from Boston. This game that I just mentioned isoften featured in Yankees advertising for its highlights, including announcer Michael Kay's exclamation,"Oh My! That is one of the greatest games you will ever see!"
Yet, perhaps the most memorable and enjoyable aspect of those seats in the old stadium was that they
were relatively inexpensive -- just six bucks. The toll at the GW Bridge was three or four bucks andparking was five. So we often went to all three games of a midweek home stand, and thus it became
something we just did. The toll at the bridge is now twelve dollars and parking is thirty-four. The seats
are now twelve and come with a serious obstructed view of left field; that view is blocked by thecenterfield sports bar. The thought that any seat in the house could come with such a serious obstructionis, in itself, an indictment of those who designed the stadium or, more specifically, those who guidedthem.
We also had the pleasure to meet and sit with a great bunch of guys, and at least one girl, whom we saw
year after year. Special among them were Gerry and his uncle Pat. We've been sitting with them all alongMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

In the end, the real reason we're giving up our seats is the new Yankee Stadium itself. It is no longer The
House That Ruth Built, nor is it The Cathedral of Baseball. It is, rather, the handiwork of architects,
planners, and marketeers who left no stone unturned in their quest for revenue production. It is, as myson so poignantly observed, The House That Greed Built.
Several years ago, when they announced that a new Yankee Stadium would be built and that the old
stadium would be torn down, I told my ticket agent that this was a disaster. He told me that I shouldunderstand that the Yankees were, first and foremost, a business. I instructed him that he was wrong.The Yankees were not a business. They were, and remain, a community trust. All baseball teams are.
Unfortunately, they're in the hands of corporate greed. The same corporate greed that runs our country
with one thing, and only one thing, in mind. And the players are no better -- it's the American Way.
They'd sell the rights to our flag if they could. And they might have that chance some day yet.
Too bad.Yours ever,
A Yankee fan

It could be worse. In San Diego, they condemned twice the amount of land needed to build Petco
Park, re-zoned it Commercial, and basically gave it to John Moores, the Padres' billionaire owner.

A community trust indeed. The theft of Federal parkland and the promise to restore facilities to all of
those who lost when they tore up McCarran Pk which the community continues to wait for, marksthem as a community trust indeed. 
The new stadium is wrong every way a stadium can be.

So it used to be, $6 + 4 + 5 = $15.
Now, $12 + 12 + 34 = $58.
Almost quadruple - wow, tough to justify that as a casual entertainment expense. I'd be ditching too.

And that's $12 for an obstructed view seat -- none of which should have been created in
the new stadium. instead, they created hundreds if not thousand+ by blithely placing asports bar that ruined the view for thousands of fans and can only accommodate a fewhundred at best with a view of the field AND you need a special pass to go in there. Buyinga ticket to the game doesn't get you in. My regular bleacher seats doubled in price from$10 to $20 in three years. Great seats and many other stadiums charge more for theircheapest seats. $20 is not a lot for a game...but it is a lot if you want to encourage aregular fan base that goes to a lot of games. Short term profits, long term disillusioned fans.The good seats are so expensive even millionaires have taken a pass and they're almoststrictly corporate now, which means the seats are sold but are often empty (until post-season or big games) and the TV network must struggle not to show empty stretches ofseats to viewers during the game.
