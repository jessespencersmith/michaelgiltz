            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  N O V E M B E R  2 0 ,  2 0 0 6New Line Dumps Peter Jackson From "TheHobbit"Director Peter Jackson and New Line have been in deep discussionsabout filming two "Hobbit" movies as soon as 2008. But since Jacksonhas been suing New Line -- claiming they owe him tens of millions ofdollars from the trilogy, New Line has decided to dump him from theproject. The One Ring website broke the news with an email directlyfrom Jackson himself saying New Line had called to tell him ta-ta fornow. Some news reports have suggested Jackson believed he wascheated out of upwards of $100 million on the trilogy. But say Jacksoncould have been placated with $50 million and a clearer arrangementon the new movies. Why endanger two films that would gross easily$1.5 billion at the box office ALONE (and that's being conservative),not to mention massive DVD sales, etc for a total gross of, very roughly$3 billion? Why endanger all of that over $50 million you probablyowed him anyway? If the two movies cost $700 million to make andmarket (that's $300 mil per movie -- both shot at once of course -- anda massive $400 mil in marketing, which is very aggressive), that's still$2.3 billion in profits to be divied up among the studios, Jackson, theactors and so on. Round it down to $2 billion. They've endangered $2billion by worrying about $50 million. That's practically a minoraccounting error when the figures get that large.
