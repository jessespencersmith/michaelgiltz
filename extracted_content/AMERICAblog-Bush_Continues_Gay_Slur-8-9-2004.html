8/09/2004 05:34:00 PMAt campaign rallies today, Bush again made his subtle anti-gay jibethat Dick Cheney may not be the prettiest face, etc. etc. Even moregalling, Laura Bush spoke on stem-cell research and had the nerve toaccuse Kerry of playing on the desperate hopes of families who havea loved one suffereing from a degenerative disease."But I know that embryonic stem-cell research is very preliminaryright now, and the implication that cures for Alzheimer's are aroundthe corner is just not right. And it's really not fair to people who arewatching a loved one suffer with this disease," said Luara per the AP.First, she should avoid that just "around the corner" slogan siince it'salready boomeranging back on Bush. Second, she's got gall. Bushrefuses to back basic medical research because of his own narrowreligious beliefs -- keeping potential life-saving advances a dim if notimpossible dream -- and the candidate who says science shoulddecide where research dollars go, not narrow fanatic ideology, is theone who is more compassionate to families suffering fromParkinson's? Please.P.S. By the way, it's okay for Laura Bush to oppose serious stem-cellresearch, even based on her religious beliefs (though since that's theonly basis, it should always give a thinking person pause in a freesociety). What I strongly object to is her attack claiming Kerry isbeing less compassionate. That's unfair. She's the one who wants herpersonal religious beliefs impede medical progress so she's the onewho has explaining to do. Instead of doing that, she attacks Kerry?Absurd.
