 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Do Cry for Evita
EVITA  * 1/2 out of ****
MARQUIS THEATRE
Broadway fans can go see Jesus Christ Superstar  and
Evita  back to back and appreciate anew how the team of
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice were growing by
leaps and bounds even as their collaboration was coming
to an end. (They reunited over the years, including
writing some songs for a London production of The
Wizard Of Oz  that opened last year.) Compared to
Superstar , this musical about the life of Eva Peron is the height of sophistication, though Rice's lyrics
remain blunt and banal. Lloyd Webber has remained cursed with poor lyrics his entire career (not
counting T.S. Eliot, mind you).
Taken on its own terms, however, my first brush with the show on stage (I saw the film version with
Madonna) leaves little impression. Most of the numbers blend together and the strongest melody isreprised throughout beginning with "What A Circus," the famed peak "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina" andthe finale. This unfolding of a melody throughout a show can climax with a powerful "reveal" of thenumber. Here it simply feels like leaning on a good tune too often.
Still, this is a handsome production with a full orchestra sounding marvelous. One can imagine a hungry,
attention-grabbing actress like Patti Lupone making the most of the spotlight. Unfortunately, the
acclaimed actress Elena Roger can barely hold the stage. Her voice is not remotely equipped for the part
and her stage presence is minimal. You look at the spectacle of this Evita  when you should be riveted on
Eva Peron herself. An entire nation prostrates itself at her feet? You doubt they'd even notice her.
The story is simple: Eva is a young girl in the provinces who hitches her star to a singer so she can get to
the big city. The should-be amusing "Goodnight and Thank You" shows Eva working her way throughlovers and up the social ladder until she's a famous entertainer and can meet the rising political playerJuan Peron (Michael Cerveris). Together, they become a dynamo and rocket to power, though illness willquickly undermine the noblesse oblige of Evita, who likes to help the little people when it suits her. Shedies tragically young, almost a saint to the downtrodden but despised by the wealthy class she bothyearned to join and hated. It's all narrated by Che, of all people (Ricky Martin), who cynically reminds theMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>audience of the poor peasants forgotten along the way.
Evita should be a fiercely ambitious character as embodied in her singing. But Roger's voice is so thin and
small (she played Edith Piaf in another hit show in London) that it simply disappears in the higherregister. You're more worried for her than intimidated or magnetized. Her best moments occur when she
can stay in that lower register and speak-sing a song, such as the duet "I'd Be Surprisingly Good For
You," with Cerveris. He, by the way, is a marvelous performer, but paired with Roger and singing what is
essentially a dull and uninteresting role, even Cerveris can't do much. Also less demanding vocally(though during this song she's dancing quite a bit) is "Buenos Aires" with Martin. He's an amiablepresence on stage albeit with little of the ability to give Che the edginess and cynicism the roledesperately needs.
When it comes to that iconic number "Don't Cry For Me Argentina," Roger simply makes you feel
nervous. It works better at the end when her frail voice can be seen as in character, since Evita is dying
when she reprises the tune from her deathbed (where, frankly, it makes more emotional sense than itdoes on the balcony anyway). She's especially exposed on "You Must Love Me," the ballad written for the
film which she sings alone on a stage with Cerveris. Without sets and dancing and other cast members to
distract, you have nothing to focus on but her unconvincing vocals.
Frankly, it's difficult to understand why she was cast in London, much less here, where the standards for
musicals are and should be the highest in the world. Roger unquestionably does not posses the pipes tosing this part. Since this isn't a dance show where dancing might be the most important talent and shecertainly doesn't act anyone off the stage, why would her ability to -- at best -- get through the bignumbers rather than nail them be acceptable? The entire show is built around what should be the fieryperformance at its heart, making this Evita  very cool indeed.
That said, it looks great. Director Michael Grandage and choreographer Rob Ashford keep everythingmoving smoothly and the storyline is clear from start to finish. The sets and costumes by ChristopherOram are very good, with the central set serving among others as the framework for a cafe, a city squareand the presidential palace for the balcony scene. They lean a bit too much on some stills and video
footage from real life, which soon lose their immediacy. The opening with mourners and dancers hidden
in darkness and fog at the news of Evita's death is eerie. But that fog never seems to dissipate; it returnsagain and again throughout the show, demonstrating a lack of imagination that the lighting by NealOstin can't overcome. What was at first effective ultimately becomes too familiar and -- like thedocumentary footage of Evita -- loses its power.
Cerveris as mentioned makes little impression, which should tell you how emotionally flat this show is
since Cerveris almost always makes an impression. Martin's return to the stage is not bad and it would beinteresting to see him in a lighter, romantic part where he might work well. Max Von Essen has fun in thesmall role of Evita's first love, Magaldi. And Rachel Potter is a blessed oasis performing one of the show'sstrongest tunes "Another Suitcase In Another Hall." You're tempted to assume that the main reason Evitatosses out this mistress of Juan Peron is simply because Potter has a much better singing voice.
Nonetheless, with Joseph & The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat  and Superstar  back on Broadway
several times over the years and now, finally, Evita , one has to ask: is it time... dare I wonder if they're
planning to revive... Cats ?

I don't understand why they cast for the Broadway run. She got the same exact reviews in the
London stint. There are so many talented ladies that can sing the hell out of this part! I know causeI've seen some of them and they are equity members. It just seems like such a mistake.

We've gotta come to terms with the fact that Lloyd Weber/Rice's work simply isn't that good. Evita,like Superstar, has its moments -- but not nearly enough of them to sustain a full evening'sentertainment or justify obscenely high ticket prices. Recency   | Popularity

The original production became a huge hit thanks to a stunning staging by Hal Prince (perhaps the
best work of his career) and the lightning-in-a-bottle casting of Lupone, Mandy Patinkin, and BobGunton in the leads. But when you replace all that with a merely good staging and just serviceableperformances, it exposes the score for the shallow, curiously undramatic claptrap it is.
I usually don't begrudge a theater writer any success, even if their work isn't my cup of tea. I know
how hard it is to succeed in the theater, and I respect anyone who can break through. 
But in Tim Rice's case, I make an exception. Oy, those school-musical lyrics! Oy, those flatfooted
rhymes that go thud in the night! "Adore me/Dior me!" -- give me a break.
08:31 AM on 04/12/2012
This is maybe the 10th review I've read of the restaged Evita that mentions Roger is simply unableto carry the role of Evita. I dunno, I haven't seen the show. But I have to ask: don't they haveauditions? Wouldn't it be obvious to someone with trained ears at some point early in the process?Wouldn't the ability to, um, carry the part be part of the qualifications?
What do I know. I'm no Broadway impresario.

As you suggest, this isn't the case of a famous star being cast to draw in crowds despite
their technical proficiency. It's an unknown. I honestly have no idea what convinced them tocast her, but you can read many reviews and they're fairly consistent in saying she has a
weak voice. You'd think that would be job one, but apparently not.
08:09 AM on 04/12/2012
There 's just something unseemly about a musical about Evita Peron. What next, 'Eva Braun--The
Musical'?
08:33 AM on 04/12/2012
You're no patron of the arts, that's for sure. I saw Evita the first go-round. Excellent. Goodart provides context and understanding. Maybe you should stick to TVLand reruns, steamer.;-)
10:10 AM on 04/12/2012
Oh please. The music is wonderful and it's only the subject that presents a problemof sorts. I would have rather seen Evita done as a straight play where getting at thereal Evita would have been much more fascinating. The musical arena just isn't the
right setting for a tyrant, unless it's satire or farce.Permalink  | Share it

She was incredible the night I saw the show.
Looking at your past ratings, you don't like much, do you?
03:25 AM on 04/12/2012
Hi Jimmy, Glad you enjoyed the show. Broadway is an expensive proposition, so it can be
a real bummer to fork out money and not enjoy the show. Even a bad movie can feel like arip-off. I'm hardly alone in criticizing the performance of Elena Roger. Almost every review(even the ones that liked her acting and dancing) conceded her voice is not strong; most
were much harsher. But even if I were alone in my opinion, naturally I'd still back up what I
said. I'm not sure what you mean about my past ratings. Of course I like some shows and
dislike most. Most plays and musicals, just like most movies and books and albums and TV
shows, are not great. Far from it. That's why we love the ones that do succeed. Here's alink to my favorite shows of 2011, so no one thinks I poo-poo everything.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/theater-the-best-shows-of_b_1176809.html
03:30 AM on 04/12/2012
It's only April, but here's a list of shows I raved about in 2012: UK comic Daniel Kitson'swonderful It's Always Right Now Until It's Later; a revival of a show about acclaimeddirector Robert Wilson called Bob; the revival of Porgy & Bess with Audra McDonald; the
opera Ernani at the Met with Angela Meade; the excellent Off Broadway play Tribes; and
the excellent Broadway transfer of my favorite musical of 2011: Once. That's six showsworth rushing to see, which is probably more than most people catch in a year. So even ifwe disagree on Evita, I hope that won't dissuade you from seeing some of these others.
