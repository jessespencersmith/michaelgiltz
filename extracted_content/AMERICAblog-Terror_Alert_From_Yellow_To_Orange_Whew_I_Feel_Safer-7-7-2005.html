7/07/2005 12:10:00 PMJust watched the press conference with Homeland Securityhead Michael Chertoff who spoke smoothly and reassuringly.He took questions for about three minutes, which seems ratherabrupt given the situation and that he can't be too pressed fortime, since the attack took place in another country.The most foolish moment: Chertoff said the terror alert fortransportation only was raised from yellow to orange. Then heclaimed that since we've been on heightened alert yellow foryears, that this had provided us an added level of comfort andsecurity. No, being on heightened alert yellow for years is ajoke that makes us look foolish. You can't be on heightenedalert for years at a time; if that's the level of security we willneed forever than that isn't a heightened alert level, it's thestandard level of security and keeping the threat level raisedfor years is ridiculous. It's like saying putting on your seat beltwhile driving is heightened security when driving. No, that'sstandard operating procedure.The debasement of security alerts: no one has addressed thefact that the color coded levels of threat have become a joke orthat Tom Ridge admitted the White House often raised thesecurity threat for political purposes over his objections. Whenthe codes have been abused for years, don't they lose theireffectiveness.The missing question: we're worried about our transportationand security. Homeland Security oversees the Coast Guard.And not one question about the front page story in USA Todayabout the crumbling equipment they use and Bush's plan todelay upgrading that equipment fully from 2025 to 2030. Howcan Chertoff justify taking 25 years to upgrade the Coast Guardwhen we are at war? How can that possibly make us safer?
