            <p>T U E S D AY,  A P R I L  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6"Two Weeks In The Midday Sun" by Roger Ebert --The Popsurfing ReviewI've been going to the Cannes Film Festival since 2000 and before myfirst trip I bought Roger Ebert's diary about attending the festival in1987. And yet, I wanted to experience it myself without anypreconceptions and put the book aside. Now I've finally read it and --no surprise -- the book is a delight. It opens with Ebert in an airportterminal, his flight delayed. He pulls out a "battery powered RadioShack portable computer" that presumably seemed like the latest inhigh tech but probably had about 16k of memory. (Much of his woesinvolve trying to file stories via phone lines. The only differencebetween Ebert and me is that he eventually figured the French phonesystem out.) His diary is a casual mix of drinking with other reporters,interviewing stars, nodding off during movies due to jet lag and theconstant question of what might win the Palm d'Or. Ebert spends a lotof time with low-level personalities and high profile honchos at CannonFilms, mixing in movie set visits for films playing at the festival like"Barfly." Though he attends a lot more parties and does a lot moreinterviews than me, Ebert's '87 experience still strikes a chord withwhat Cannes is like for me --quirky, strange, exhausting andexhilirating. *** 1/2 out of ****.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
