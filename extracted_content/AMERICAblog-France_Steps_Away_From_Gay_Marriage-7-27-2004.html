France Steps Away From Gay Marriage
by Michael in New York  on 7/27/2004 10:44:00 AM
In the "two steps forward, one step back" dance that characterizes
the gay rights struggle today, a French court has annulled France's
first gay marriage.  The ruling will undoubtedly be appealed and reach
the European Court of Human Rights. The French aren't so c'est la
vie on this: equal rights for gays has been political dynamite.
