A strong woman who can take charge
and kick butt? Pam Grier practicalllr defined
that as Coffy and Foxy Brown in B-movies of
those names in 1973 and 1974, helping to make
her the first black woman to qiace the cover of
Ms. maoazine back in 1975.
Grier proved she was more than just a campy
icon in "Fort Apache the Bronx" (1981) and in a
recurring part on the 1980s hit series "Miami Vice,"
and showed she could be sexy and in on the joke
in 1997's "Jackie Brown." On Showtime's "The L
Word," the 57-year-old actress is a bar owner
and port in the storm for the gals, including her
half sister (played by iennifer Beals).
Survivor? You bet. When Quentin Tarantino
crafted her "Jackie Brown" comeback, he
didn't see a 1970s icon; he saw an actress
ready for the best role of her career. And
nothing is sexier than a woman who knows
o what she's worth, and won't settle for less.
m
i M,G.Sally Field was rdpor-tedly turned down for the
role of Benjamin Eraddock's girlfriend in 1962's ,,The
craduate," and it's easy to see why: Her sexiness has
always been of the wholesome, all-American variety.
Even though she shot to fame as the bikini-
wearing Gidget, you just knew Field wasn't the type
who would play on the beach after dark. She even
rnacie flirting with Burt Reynolds seem innocent both
in "Smokey and the Bandit" (1977) and in her privaie
life, where Field turned down his marriage proposals.
In short, we really /lked Field, and that kept us on her
side as she formed a union in ,,Norrna Rae" (1979),
fought for her farm in "places in the Heart" (1984),
juggled suitors in "Murphy's Romance" (19g5) and
pitched a tit in "soapdish" (i991).
NoW at 60, as a widow on ABC's drama,,Brothers
& Sisters," Field makes her character Nora's desire
to date after her husband's death touching, amusing
and, yes, sexy. She won't be hitting on a teenage
gardener or her neighbor's son; that wouldn't suit
her. But when Fieid wants to find romance again,
we'll be rooting for her, as always. Michael cilb
REGAL, ROYALTY CUTE Helen
Mirren (opposite) has wowed at
the mnovies and on the red carpet;
$allir Field is America's sweetie.happening among more
seasoned female Perform-
ers. And while guYS have
long been able to main-
tain treading-rnan status as
their birthda5r candles hit ,
the thiee-Score mark, today
tire women come off just as
commanding, seSY and in
tr"me. Noivonder sonfte of
their latest work has rnol"ie
titles like "T'he Qtleenf'or
song titles lihe "UnderYour
Spell Ag;ain."
