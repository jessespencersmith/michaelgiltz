2/01/2005 06:10:00 PMIn a welcome sign, the Democrats are showing some fight andchallenging the truly absurd nomination of Alberto Gonzales forAttorney General.(We don't need to tell you how ridiculous it is to suggest a manwho subverted the Constitution, signed off on torture (byredefining virtually every cruel practice as not actually BEINGtorture), told Bush the President is above the law in times ofwar (with Bush believing we are now permanently in a state ofwar) and then gave disingenuous, pass-the-buck answers toCongress when being grilled. THIS is the guy who is supposedto be a check on the President and protect our basic rights?)According to the New York Times, the Dems are evencontemplating a fillibuster. This is EXACTLY what a fillibuster isdesigned for: letting the minority put roadblocks in front ofegregious nominations to the White House, Supreme Court, etal. (Rice didn't quite fit the bill; hence her (very weak) approvalin the Senate.My favorite moment: when Sen. Arlen Specter gets religion anddecides that affirmative action -- instead of color blind, raceneutral promotion -- is absolutely the right thing to do."Specter said that when he was first elected Philadelphia'sdistrict attorney four decades ago, there were no Hispanics inhis office, and that he had tried to broaden the ethnic mix ofhis staff. The senator said it was "not irrelevant" that Mr.Gonzales would be the first Hispanic attorney general, since hisbackground would give him a broader perspective on civilrights, immigration and other issues," according to the NewYork Times.Let's not forget his comments in support of affirmative actiondown the road.
