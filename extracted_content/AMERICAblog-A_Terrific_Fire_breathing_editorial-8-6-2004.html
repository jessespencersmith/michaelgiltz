8/06/2004 01:48:00 PMI'll quote the entire editorial by Bob Herbert in today's New YorkTimes if I don't control myself. It's passionate and on point andstirring. Here's a sample:"It's as if the government were following a script from the theater ofthe absurd. Instead of rallying our allies to a coordinated andrelentless campaign against Al Qaeda after Sept. 11, we insulted theallies, gave them the back of our hand and arrogantly sent the bulkof our forces into the sand trap of Iraq.Now we're in a fix.The war in Iraq has intensified the hatred of America around theworld and powerfully energized Al Qaeda-type insurgencies. At thesame time, it has weakened our defenses by diverting the veryresources we need - personnel, matériel and boatloads of cash - tomeet the real terror threats....Does the administration have any real sense of what motivates thenation's enemies? Does it understand the ways in which Americanpolicies are empowering its enemies? Does it grasp the crucialimportance of international alliances and coordinated intelligenceactivity in fighting terror? And is it even beginning to think seriouslyabout lessening our debilitating dependence on Middle Eastern oil?The United States is the greatest military and economic power in thehistory of the planet. But it lacks a unifying sense of national purposeat the moment, and seems uncertain, even timid, as the nationalsecurity challenges continue to mount. That is what a failure ofleadership can do to a great power."
