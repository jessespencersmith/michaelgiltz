Fraver by Design:  Five Decades of Theatre Poster Art From Broadway, Off-Broadway, and
Beyond
By Frank “Fraver” Verlizzo$34.99, Schiffer Publishing
The best theater posters capture the spirit of a show in one indelible image, stand on their own
as art, and are powerful ads that make fans reach for their wallets to buy tickets.
Fraver by Design  is just as versatile. First and foremost, it’s a career retrospective of Frank
“Fraver” Verlizzo, one of the most acclaimed artists in Broadway history — a professional
biography of the most engaging sort. But it’s also a visual treat, bursting with anecdotes aboutshows, a casual history of the art of theater posters, a behind-the-scenes peek at the selling ofBroadway, and a master class in how to go about crafting these works of art.
BOOKFILTER’S JUNE PICK OF THE MONTH
MICHAEL GILTZ  | JUNE 12, 2018
SHARE</p>
<p>Essentially, this is a coffee table book, a handsomely produced collection of hundreds of classic
images. But most every image has a succinct paragraph about it, ranging from amusing storiesto insights on how it was created, or just Verlizzo’s enthusiastic excitement over working with,say, Mia Farrow or the show at hand. Before you know it, you’re knee-deep in stories andknowledge that will be a treat for fans and genuinely useful for professionals.
