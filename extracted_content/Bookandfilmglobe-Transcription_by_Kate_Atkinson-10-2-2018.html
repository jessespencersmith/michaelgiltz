Kate Atkinson’s WWII Spy Novel Lies To The
Reader
Fool Me Once, Shame On You
 October 2, 2018  Michael Giltz   0 Comments
Author Kate Atkinson is on a roll, having reached a new peak of critical and popular success with her “let’s try
that again” novel Life After Life . Atkinson’s flight of fancy involved a heroine who lived her life over and over
again, first dying as a newborn baby, but then being born again and surviving. She later heads down differentpaths in life after life, revealing destiny, or the lack thereof, for all of us. Now, in the WW II spy novelTranscription , Atkinson gives us a heroine who tries on new lives the way others try on a new frock.
She’s Juliet Armstrong, an orphan in her teens chosen to be a typist at MI5 during the war. Juliet first works ina flat next to a meeting place for fascist sympathizers. A double agent is pretending to be a Gestapo contact,thus luring in would-be traitors so Juliet can type up their incriminating conversations. Soon, she’s in the field,cozying up to a wealthy Nazi-lover and discovering a lovely gift for lying.

world around her,  Juliet’s witty mental asides are hilarious and spot on. They bring to life this seemingly quiet
cog in the war machinery.
But just as veterans of war often say life was never that exciting again, Transcription fades quite a bit when the
fighting ends. Juliet washes up on the beaches of the BBC, working on dull radio plays intended to educateschool children. Office intrigue simply can’t compete with foreign intrigue.
When Juliet is asked at times to serve as a safe house for MI5, the pulse does not pound; it feels more like a
tiresome burden than a chance to live again the excitement of war. Worse, the novel plays very unfair when wediscover–much too late–most everyone in the book has crucial information that we do not. An unreliablenarrator is one thing. An unreliable author is quite a different pot of tea.
