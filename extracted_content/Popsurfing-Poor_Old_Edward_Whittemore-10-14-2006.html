            <p>S AT U R D AY,  O C TO B E R  1 4 ,  2 0 0 6Poor Old Edward WhittemoreI keep lots of notes about books I want to check out, dotting down anyname that gets an intriguing reference, positive review and so on. Onenote referred lazily to Edgar Whitemore, which turned out to be areference to Edward Whittemore, a rather obscure writer whosepublished work of five interconnected novels had been reprinted in2003. Truly enigmatic, both praised and disdained, he doesn't soundexactly like someone whose work I would take to heart. But I can'tresist the spectacular demise of his life as described in Wikipedia. Hewas intensely private, refused to do interviews with "unknowncorrespondents" (ie. people like me) and therefore did virtually nointerviews, [and] he lived with a woman for five years. His books --including his magnum opus the Jerusalem Quartet -- sold nothing andthen went out of print. And then?Edward Whittemore spent the final years of his life in poverty,working as a photocopier at an attorney's office. He died inAugust 3, 1995 in New York City, shortly after being diagnosedwith prostate cancer.He's 62, living in poverty, working THE COPYING MACHINE for alawyer and then dies right after being diagnosed with prostate cancer?It's enough to give an obscure freelance writer nightmares.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
