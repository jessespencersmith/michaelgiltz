Trying to stop the docudrama from beingshown was going way too far.So a massive conglomerate like ABC can play politics with 9/11, reachout to far right bloggers and right wing groups, try to cloak itself in theaura of the non-partisan 9/11 Commission Report when it knows itsmovie distorts and lies and often says the OPPOSITE of what thatreport found, and it can release this movie right before a mid-termelection.

Not the conglomerate that saw FBIagents quit in disgust from the project or refuse to get involved becausethe film was so riddled with errors, that saw Harvey Keitel refusing tostick to a script he found so distastefully misleading or inaccurate, thatsaw a director running around trying to figure out what was true andwhat wasn't, not the conglomerate that saw all of this but refused tostep in and make sure some TV movie didn't damage their reputationand distort a national tragedy for ratings and profit. No, Disney/ABCbehaved honorably but the people who pointed out their lies went toofar.What exactly IS someone supposed to do when they are shown apurported docudrama that claims to be an accurate depiction of theworst terrorist attack in our nation's history, which is going toNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
