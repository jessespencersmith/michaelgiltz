By MICHAEL GILTZ 
Jamie Foxx is a 'super­
.tar. Last night he host­
ed "Saturday Night 
Live." doing wickedly 
funny imitations of Morgan 
Freeman and Sean "Puffy" 
Combs. 
His sitcom '"I'be Jamie 
FoJC[ Show," is'a long-run­
ning hit airing on the WB 
on Friday nights. His debut 
R&B album 
respectably on the charts. 
His stand-up concerts draw 
big crowds. 
And his complex, mature 
performance as the brash 
young quarterback in 
Oliver Stone's "Any Given 
Sunday" got the best 
reviews of a star-studded 
cast (outshining AI Pacino, 
Dennis . Quaid, and 
Cameron ·Diaz). 
"It's incredible." says 
Foxx. "I've been floating the 
whole time and I'm not 
coming down." 
But unless you're Afiican 
American , you're probably 
just getting to know who 
Jamie Foxx is. 
His Tv series -about a 
youn~ comic from Texas 
who work ~ in a hotel while 
waiting for his big break -
has been a smash since its 
debut in 1996 ... at least 
among blacks. Among 
African American viewers, 
it's been ranked No. I or 
No.2 every year. But with 
today's fragmented Nielsen 
family. success among one 
demographic no longer 
translates into a wider 
audience . 
"TV's gone through a 
change," Rays Fon during a 
break from rehearsals for 
last night's "SNL." "It really 
is kin!! of separate now, sad 
to say. When there was 
'Chico and the Man' and 
'The Jefl'ersons' and 'AU 
in the Family,' everybody 
could watch those shows 
together .. 
"Now, since ·there are ao 
many networks and' ao 
many channels, you're kind 
of locked into your own 
kind sometimes, I guess 
you could say." Fir a performer like 
Poxx -who idolizes

twist? The network 
that aired "In Living 
olor" W88 Fox, 
though it proved just plain 
crazy by running the .how 
into the ground after airing 
repeate two or three times a 
week. 
'They burned it to a crisp," 
laughs Foxx. 
. But he'd already made his 
mark -even finaIJy gueet 
starring.oo a.few epi.oodeo of 
"Roc. " Then came more con-
troverSy. 
Fnxx got his own show, a 
harmless bit of silliness that 
clicked immediately with 
black audiences. But the 
Beverly Hills chapter of the 
NAACP labeled it as little 
more than buffoonery . (The 
ating of that charge was 
removed a bit when the 
national chapter for the 
NAACP nominated FOD for 
Beet Actm in a Sitcom.) 
He soldiered on, finally ful­
filling a dream of starring in 
a movie with 1997's "Booty 
Call" -only to have Bill 
Coeby caB it an embarrass­
ment that should have never 
been made. Foxx answered 
his critics -sometimes 
angrily, sometimes adroitly 
-but always with humor. 
Even "Any Given Sunday" 
had its tempest in a teapot: 
Foa got a role earmarked 
for Sean "Puffy" Combs. 
Combs says he dropped out 
after delays in the shooting 
schedule conflicted with his 
recording plans; others say 
he couldn't cut it as a quar­
terback. 
Certainly Foxx could. A 
fine student in high school, 
Foxx was also a ster quar­
terback -even though as 
early as second grade he 
knew what he really want­
ed to be was a comedian 
and a ainger. 
Now he'. pushing towards 
the goel line with two more
