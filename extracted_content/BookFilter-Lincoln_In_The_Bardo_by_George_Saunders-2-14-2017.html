From the Publisher: In his long-awaited first novel, American literary
master George Saunders delivers his most original, transcendent, and
moving work yet. Unfolding in a graveyard over the course of a single
night, narrated by a dazzling chorus of voices,  Lincoln in the Bardo  is an
experience unlike any other—for no one but Saunders could conceive it.February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has
begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long,
bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln’s beloved eleven-year-oldson, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter ofdays, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in aGeorgetown cemetery. “My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,” the
president says at the time. “God has called him home.” Newspapers report
that a grief-stricken…

What We Say
I've admired writer George Saunders, but for some reason haven't felt drawn to him. I was apparently the only person on
Earth who wasn't gobsmacked by his most recent short story collection "Tenth Of December." I appreciated the Barthelme-like cleverness but "appreciate" is where I stopped. Wisely, I imagined the problem was with me and planned to return to it
someday soon with an open mind. Now here comes his first novel and gobsmacked is the least of it. It's the most formally
daring novel I can think of since David Mitchell's "Cloud Atlas." And here that obvious intellect of Saunders is married towarmth and beauty and an all-encompassing vision of this life and the next. "Bardo" is a Tibetan word that hints at theShare This Book

<p>Buddhist concept of an intermediate state. It usually means that moment when your essence is flitting between one
existence and the next, the period when your previous life has ended but the next one hasn't quite incarnated yet. Being in
the bardo is an opportunity for wisdom and insight, but also a danger. More broadly, it means anyone in a state of flux,
perhaps due to an illness or a dramatic change in their life. President Lincoln enters the bardo upon the death of hisbeloved son Willie. History tells us that Lincoln rather poignantly returned again and again to the cemetery on the day ofWillie's burial, just to gaze upon and even hold his son one last time. From that shred of fact, Saunders has spun out aremarkable tale. It begins strictly with quotations from the historical record. Using passages from diaries and letters and
biographies and the like -- just one quote after another, each one indicating its source -- Saunders sets the scene. The
President and his wife hold a party while their son Willie is feverish upstairs. Unexpectedly, the boy takes a turn for theworse and dies. Naturally, Lincoln is broken by this and the country holds its breath, wondering if the President will shakeoff his grief and again shoulder the burden of the Civil War. Aha, I thought, Saunders is going to write an entire novel bypiecing together found quotations! But no, suddenly at the cemetery other voices intrude, the voices of the dead. In an
echo of the play "Our Town," we hear from the spirits still hovering nearby, the people who have some desperate unfinished
business or simply retreat instinctively from the unknown afterlife to come. These voices include Willie himself, a Reverendwho fears he is damned but doesn't know why, a gay man who killed himself after being rejected by his lover, an enslavedwoman who was raped to death, a drunken couple who are ferociously determined swearers, little girls, old men and on and
on -- each of them with a story they want, indeed must tell and a reason for not moving on. When Lincoln returns to visit
Willie, the other spirits are astonished at such compassion. People don't return, not to touch certainly, not to actually hold.Yet it's not good to tarry, especially for children. And so a struggle ensues.The spirits want to remain but avoid admittingthe obvious fact that they are dead. Willie wants to remain so he can see his father again, yet remain is precisely what heshouldn't do. We see the possible fate that awaits people (terrible, frightening, glorious). We see the bitterness of lives
half-lived. And we see Lincoln in the bardo, consumed with grief and yet offered new insight and purpose to fight and win
and give a higher meaning to the bloody war, thanks to his communion with the spirits. It's a funny, vulgar, sad, fantastical,profane and philosophical novel that reaffirms what everyone else has been saying: George Saunders is a hell of a writer. --Michael Giltz
