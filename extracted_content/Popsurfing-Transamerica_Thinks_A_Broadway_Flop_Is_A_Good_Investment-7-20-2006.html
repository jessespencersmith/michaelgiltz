            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  J U LY  2 0 ,  2 0 0 6Transamerica Thinks A Broadway Flop Is A GoodInvestmentSeriously, Transamerica executives say they don't mind the fact thattheir $8 million Broadway musical "Hot Feet" closed after threemonths of half-empty houses. Hey, it's branding, they say. Do youreally want to work with an investment company that thinks Broadwayflops are a good idea? The company also sunk money into the alreadyrunning "Brooklyn: The Musical" (and if you'd seen "Brooklyn: TheMusical" you'd know what an insanely idiotic investment THAT was).And the last time Transamerica was involved in entertainment, it madethe historic flop movie "Heaven's Gate" and then decided maybe theyshould sell United Artists. But what am I doing? Hey, Transamerica,how'd you like to get some great branding and jump into the excitingworld of online blogging? I don't curse and all I'm taking a stance onare movies and TV and music so no one could get offended. For$100,000 a year, you can be the sole advertiser on Popsurfing and reapthe rewards of the Internet. Call me. We'll do lunch.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
