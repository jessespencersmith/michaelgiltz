Martin LandauIndicts Hollywoodfor Crimes andMisdemeanors! February 16, 2016
Evil Under the Blu-RayWhy are Agatha Christie movies so bad?! September 15, 2020 "Michael GiltzKenneth Branagh’s new version of Agatha Christie’s Death On The Nileostensibly hits theaters this October with an ALL-STAR cast, as movies ofthis sort do. Annette Bening! Armie Hammer! Gal Gadot! And of courseBranagh as the self-satis!ed Belgian sleuth, Hercule Poirot! It follows2017’s Murder On The Orient Express, Branagh’s massively successfulreboot with another all-star cast.
 Commercially-successful reboot, that is. Like most big screen adaptationsof Agatha Christie, Branagh overstu"ed his Murder, and it overlooked themain appeal of Christie’s work: her sleuths. You don’t return to 221-BBaker Street for the eccentric characters peopling each adventure,however colorful they may be. You return to spend time with Holmes andWatson. You don’t pop into the brownstone at West 35th Street inManhattan to !nd out whodunit. You return to dine on gourmet mealswith Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. And Agatha Christie’s most enduringcreations are not her clever twists on murder; they’re the quietly inquisitiveMiss Marple and the understandably egotistical Hercule Poirot.Those two are perfect for the small screen, where the likes of Joan Hicksonand David Suchet have embodied them to perfection.  Murderers comeand go but it’s the comforting, cozy, enduring presence of the sleuths,those keen analysts of human nature who Explain It All in satisfying detail,that warm the hearts of murder mystery bu"s. Someone always dies, butit’s never anyone you really know or care about. Brew a cuppa and enjoy.Yet Hollywood can’t leave poor Christie alone. It’s been adapting her books,poorly, since 1928. Christie said only two of the dozens and dozens ofmovies based on her work got it right. The 1957 stand-alone courtroomdrama Witness For The Prosecution is a clockwork device that runssmoothly. And 1974’s version of Murder On The Orient Express, directedby Sidney Lumet, enjoys the tremendous bene!t of being based on a novelthat’s !endishly satisfying in its construction. In it, Christie gently subvertsthe classic murder mystery by !nding the perfect solution for a crime that’saudacious, amusing and wonderful all at the same time.It’s a comfort to know Christie died in 1976, just after Lumet’s ALL-STARversion played to massive acclaim, Oscar wins and bo"o box o#ce. Shepassed away before producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwinfollowed that platinum success with the brass, lead and tin grosses ofthree more Christie adaptations: 1978’s Death On The Nile, 1980’s TheMirror Crack’d and 1982’s Evil Under The Sun.Thanks to Branagh making a killing with Orient Express (sue me), all threeare newly available on BluRay in nice prints from Kino Lorber. In particular, Kino presents Nile in a well-done restoration. But all three lookgood, feature modest extras (Nile and Evil Under the Sun feature blandpromo material generated at the time) and enthusiastic audio commentaryfrom !lm historians Howard S. Berger, Steven Mitchell and NathanielThompson.Nile in particular is hard to rent or even stream online, so if you’re inclinedto buy it, jump. But beware: it’s also the least satisfying. Whereas OrientExpress has the most enjoyable solution of them all, Death On The Nile’smurder plot is nonsense.Starring Olivia Hussey and Jack WardenUnless you’re one of those obsessive people who jot down clues andexpect to solve the mystery before the sleuth, most people don’t reallycare how a crime is committed. A murder can strain credulity as long asthe characters are engaging and the detecting fun. But Nile’s solution isidiotic and only works if everyone on a tiny paddle ship cruising up the Nileagree to stay put when shots ring out and then helpfully pile onto one sideof the ship while the killer tip toes away on the other, to name just one plothole. A dark twist at the end can’t rescue it.They !ll the cast with stars, but de!nitely of The Love Boat variety, mainlyolder actors just before or well past or never in their prime. I’m thinking ofyou Bette Davis, Olivia Hussey, David Niven, Mia Farrow, Jack Warden andPeter Ustinov !lling in for Albert Finney as Poirot. The costumes byAnthony Powell are eye-stirring, I guess, and won an Oscar. His win is onlyslightly less mysterious than Powell’s victory six years earlier for theequally dreadful !lm Travels With My Aunt, which absurdly beat out TheGodfather and Lady Sings The Blues. Now that’s criminal.The Taylor Crack’d
Sensing the well would soon run dry after Nile’s indi"erent reception, theproducers jumped ship. They launched a new franchise with The MirrorCrack’d, this time with Angela Lansbury as the pleasantly perceptive MissMarple. A la Christie’s novels, Marple spends most of the !lm inside hercottage or puttering around in the garden, missing nothing, asking sharpquestions and !guring out the killer before be-stirring herself to !nallyconfront the villain. It’s very faithful and very dull.The only pleasure is found in Elizabeth Taylor’s hammy turn as an agingmovie star making a comeback. Taylor has one gloriously campy, cannily-acted scene. She spars with an investigator while gliding about in an all-white $owing caftan that !lls up the room. Suddenly she is emotionallyoverwhelmed and falls into an hysterical monologue…until the investigatorstarts saying her lines along with her, clueing us into the fact that Taylor isquoting one of her old movies.The fading star’s pleasure over his fandom is only slightly shadowed by thefact that she’s been found out. And when the man says he would havecounseled Taylor to make her case in a more heartfelt, low-key manner,damned if she doesn’t immediately do that without any sense of irony. Thefact that the caftan doesn’t completely steal the scene is a credit to Taylor’smagnetism. A few catty moments from co-stars Tony Curtis, Kim Novakand Rock Hudson aside, the only reason to watch it is to spy on Lansburyprepping for Murder, She Wrote’s Jessica Fletcher.Evil Under the Sun is pretty good though
 But here’s one !nal mystery. Why is Evil Under The Sun so unexpectedlygood? It’s just as satisfying as the 1974 Murder On The Orient Expressthough no one noticed…at !rst. As the !lm bu"s point out on their audiocommentary, the movie became a staple on HBO, back when that paychannel played any !lm on an endless loop, sometimes three or four timesa day for weeks.I’m pretty sure I saw it there for the !rst and second and seventh time,enjoying its old Hollywood camp, Ustinov’s hamminess, and Powell’scostumes. This time Powell really did deserve an Oscar nomination butdidn’t get it. The costumes aren’t just lavish; they cleverly reveal character,like Roddy McDowall’s queer and spoiled man-child of a sailor out!t.Powell’s creations are also front and center for a jaw-dropping reveal atthe end. Oh sure, any old !lm bu" will see this moment coming a mile o"but it’s still great, sexy fun.This time the stars are just that much livelier than before. Maggie Smithgoofs around as a hotel proprietress with a yen for solving crime, DianaRigg looks fabulous as her bitchy actress friend and James Mason glidesthrough the sets without ever spilling a drop of his drink. The others arewell cast, with Sylvia Miles asked to do no more than absolutely necessaryand doing it well, while Nicholas Clay (Lancelot in Excalibur) looksindecently good in a dinner jacket or a skimpy bathing suit. At this pointthe cast feels like a rep company, since Smith and Jane Birkin and Ustinovare just two of the team back for another go-round, not to mentiondirector Guy Hamilton and screenwriter Anthony Sha"er.I’ve distracted you with these red herrings because the real reason EvilUnder The Sun works is because the focus is always on Poirot, just as itwould be in a long-running TV series. To be fair, director Hamilton of JamesBond fame is much more on the ball here than The Mirror Crack’d. ButUstinov is what matters, o"ering a Poirot that is intelligent but morecomical than Christie intended.Mind you, Christie didn’t like Poirot the way she liked Miss Marple. So shemight approve of the way he’s poked and prodded and punched andmocked and teased from start to !nish. We never doubt Poirot’s mentalacuity. But Smith will roll her eyes when he praises himself. A gentlemanwill bash him in the face when Poirot is too pointed in his observations.And if no one is watching, the self-preserving Poirot will dip his toe into atoo-cold ocean, shiver, mime swimming for a moment and then scurryback out again.It’s a delicious moment, capped later when someone wonders if heenjoyed his swim. Did you observe me, he asks quickly? Assured theyhaven’t, Poirot disingenuously says it was rather refreshing. So is EvilUnder The Sun, an under-appreciated !lm that proves adapting Poirot forthe movies doesn’t have to be a criminal waste of talent. But I fear Branaghwill keep Poirot’s silly moustache rather than the man front and centerwhile steering his new !lm to commercial success. As with his OrientExpress, sometimes crime does pay.#$Tags: Agatha Christie, Angela Lansbury, Death on the Nile, ElizabethTaylor, Evil Under the Sun, Gal Gadot, Hercule Poirot, Kenneth Branagh,Miss Marple, Murder On The Orient Express, Peter Ustinov, The MirrorCrack'd
