4/19/2005 01:05:00 AMThe Washington Post reports that Tom DeLay emailed anextremely lengthy missive defending himself (running SIXpages, single-spaced) to supporters in his suburban Houstondistrict. Is somebody getting desperate? The gist of the email:DeLay good; Democrats bad.Titled "What The Press Isn't Telling You," it goes on to blamethe Democrats for his numerous admonishments last year andhis current pile-up of ethical doo-doos and when it isn'tblaming the Dems it blames the Dem-loving media. Andeveryone's lying about why the three Republicans who crossedparty lines to uphold basic standards on the ethics committeeby admonishing DeLay were kicked off: it had nothing to dowith him. DeLay has never done anything wrong in the past;he ain't doing anything wrong in the present and he's not goingto do anything wrong in the future.Guess Newt isn't exactly on speed-dial with this guy. Let's hopethis time the stonewalling doesn't pay off.
