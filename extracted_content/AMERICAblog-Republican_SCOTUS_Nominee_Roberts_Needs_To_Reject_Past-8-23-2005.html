8/23/2005 02:55:00 PMYep, Bush is refusing to offer relevant documents from thecareer of Supreme Court nominee John Roberts to the Senate.Why would anyone want to know details of someone's careerbefore giving them a lifetime appointment? Are the Dems reallyrolling over on this one? Americans won't think you'reobstructionist if you stand on principle and list the othernominees who've provided similar information. Americanswon't think you're obstructionist when you list all the pillars ofour society that Roberts opposes based on the records we dohave. Heck, even Republicans admit the info that did slip out isdamaging.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a staunch supporter of thepresident's judicial nominees, acknowledged that some ofRoberts' written comments will elicit "some toughquestions" from the committee. But he added: "These arecomments made a long time ago. I suspect, like mostof us, that with additional life experience, his viewshave matured."So according to even Republicans, John Roberts needs to rejectstances he's made in the past. When do you draw a line in the sand?If it's not for someone who lied about their links to the Federalists,forgot about being a lobbyist, someone who thought the ReaganAdministration was too LIBERAL, someone who repeatedly mockedthe idea of women's rights and the fact that they face discrimination,someone who repeatedly showed a disdain for basic rights like theright to vote or the separation of church and state and someone whokeeps secret about his work for a number of years in thegovernment, well if you don't draw a line in the sand on him, when doyou?
