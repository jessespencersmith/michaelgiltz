THE GREAT PARADE: BROADWAY’S ASTONISHING, NEVER-T0-BE-
FORGOTTEN 1963-1964 SEASON
By Peter Filichia
The movies have 1939, often called the greatest year in history for the Hollywood studios.
Baseball has the ’27 Yankees. And theater, some would say, had the season that ran from thefall of 1963 through spring of 1964. Most would say the creative heyday was in the 1940s but it’shard to argue with Peter Filichia’s fondness for the astonishing talent on display in thatremarkable season. A fixture on the theater scene for many years as critic, TV personality,
Broadway Direct contributor and force on the Drama Desk and other awards, Filichia goes
deep into the shows and gossip and lore behind the season. Just listing the stars trodding theboards among the 68 new productions will whet your appetite: Barbra Streisand, Carol
