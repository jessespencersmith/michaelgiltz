** Warner Bros., $30.99 
IF you're in the mood for an . 
apocalyptic, end-of-the-world 
saga starring a stolid hero,. 
"Constantine" is the movie for 
you. It's certainly better than 
the last two "Matrix" movies. 
And Keanu Reeves has fme 
support from the likes of Tilda 
Swinton. Extras include 
commentary by the director. Michael Palin -
Himalaya ***'/. BBCAmeric ~4~9~.9 ~8 ______ __ 
TIDS is the latest in the travel 
series fromPalin and it's among 
his wittiest, thanks to Palin's 
curiosity about the feared head­
hunting tribe oLKonyak and other 
ights. If you prefer. however, to 
travel the world at war, check out 
the ''BBC History of World War 
II" (BBC America, $149.98). Space Station (lMAX) 
*** Warner Bros. 19.99 
IS it even possible to h arTom 
Cruise -who narrates this nifty 
look at the space tation­
without thinking of his media 
meltdown? No, but it doesn't 
detract from some amazing 
images of space. The only 
drawback? The 47-ntinute film is 
not in the stunning 3-D of the 
theatrical version. Man of the House 
* Sony, $28.95 
WATCH this comedy about a 
Texas Ranger guarding some 
cheerleaders. and you can 
almost see Tommy Lee Jones 
thinking to himself, "Has it 
come to this?" Jones is 
following this efforc with his 
directorial debut "The Burials 
of Melquiades Estrada."</p>
