 HuffPo Exclusive: Labelle's Nona
Hendryx Speaks Out!
Read More:  Apollo , Labelle , Nona Hendryx , Patti Labelle ,
Sarah Dash , Entertainment News
The genre-bending, musically adventurous ladies
of Labelle (of "Lady Marmalade" fame) launchtheir first tour in 30 years  on Friday, December
19 at the Apollo in New York City  before heading
out across the country in 2009. It comes hard onthe heels of Labelle's new Back To Now  CD,
easily the comeback album of the year thanks tonew songs like "Candlelight," "Superlover" and"Tears For The World," not to mention a raucous,earth-shaking cover of Cole Porter's "Miss OtisRegrets" which brings the trio back full circle totheir early days when they performed
adventurous, unlikely tunes like "Danny Boy" and "Over The Rainbow" alongside r&b originals.
It would be a shame to reduce Labelle to "Voulez vous coucher avec moi?" since the group was
such a titanic creative force thanks to albums like Nightbird, Phoenix  and Chameleon . They
performed at the Metropolitan Opera, saw the Alvin Ailey dance troupe create pieces set to theirmusic and taught David Bowie and Queen and everyone else a thing or two about showmanship.(You can listen to a terrific 1975 concert streamed on the website Wolfgang's Vault. ) And each
woman has made her mark as a solo artist. Sarah Dash  enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with the
Rolling Stones and has explored gospel, soul and other genres. Patti LaBelle  of course hit a
commercial peak in the 80s with hits like "New Attitude" and "On My Own." And Nona Hendryxdove into rock, punk, and even New Age when not collaborating with the likes of Talking Headsand Peter Gabriel.
Hendryx -- always the most outspoken and political of the group (though all of them have been
active in donating their time to social and political causes over the years) -- talked exclusively withHuffington Post about the group, their legacy and the new CD.
HuffPo:  During a 1975 live concert, Labelle performed a song called "System" that you promised
would be on the group's next album. It took 33 years, but you finally did it. I know the System is

<p>Michael Giltz: HuffPo Exclusive: Labelle's Nona Hendryx Speaks Out!
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/huffpo-exclusive-labelles_b_151233.html [4/5/2009 12:56:02 PM]still in place, but I wonder if you ever imagined that by the time you released the song on an album
that a black man would be the President-elect.
Hendryx:  I was very into science fiction and futuristic ways of thinking but it didn't take me that
far. [laughs] It is wonderful and amazing. No matter who is in that particular seat, still the System
exists. It's a thing in and of itself that controls or tries to control human behavior. I would havethought by now the system would have learned that you can't.
HuffPo: All three of you have shone a spotlight on New Orleans and other causes. And you spoke
openly to The Advocate about your bisexuality in 2001. Nothing could dim the excitement of
Obama's win on election night, but it was bittersweet to see some anti-gay initiatives win in
California and elsewhere.
Hendryx:  Human beings are who they are and you cannot legislate who someone's going to fall in
love with or care for or want to be with. Now, I don't particularly believe in the concept of
marriage. That's never been my belief in how and why people are together. The legal side of it isvery important because I've seen friends have horrible experiences. So I understand that. But Idon't want to emulate someone and take on anything of them that is really handcuffing me in anyway. Because it's about oh you want to be like heterosexuals - one man and one woman. That'scrap, bullshit anyway. [laughs] I'm not aspiring to that. What I'm aspiring to are my rights as ahuman being.
HuffPo:  When a group stops working together -- especially a group of women -- people like to
imagine egos and catfights. But Labelle collaborated together for 17 years and you've all been
friends since then. Still, you're three strong women and none of you wanted to record an albumunless it could live up to the body of work you had created. What was it like really working witheach other again?
Hendryx:  It's great and...frustrating at the same time. [said fondly] It's like family getting
together again which can be absolutely horrendous at moments and at other times a love fest.HuffPo:  Did you really all have a sleepover at Patti's house?
Hendryx:  We ended up all three of us in the bathroom putting on makeup and getting ready to go
out somewhere.HuffPo:  If it were a movie, you would have all broken out into song.
Hendryx:  We were! We were singing the parts of "Superlover" because we were going to do it that
morning. Pat of course always puts on her makeup and then she puts on the same makeup that
you've put on, on her, again. So she has on makeup for three. Like everything it has its challenges.We are individuals and we have our individual issues we deal with. But like a family, you rise aboveit. We've grown and we are stronger.
HuffPo : How is Sarah stronger?
Hendryx: She's much more confident in her place within Labelle. I was the writer, Patti was the
lead singer and Sarah was the pretty one. Today, she's much more confident that she's integral to
the group. Without one of those voices, it's not Labelle. And Sarah's very acute. She'll hearsomething and bring it to our attention that isn't working. We all listen differently and she listensin a different way that's very helpful. She's very into making sure that we are making the Labellesound. She's pinpointed what that is vocally.
HuffPo:  How is Patti stronger?
Hendryx:  Patti is stronger in her choices. Her choices in the past were -- to me -- a lot of the time
driven by a need to please other people. Yes, she loves and cares about people but she's much
stronger about what she wants to do and the music she chooses. Even if she likes somebody andthey have a song, she doesn't have to do it. She's much more focused in the studio. That's not herfavorite place to be; she just wants to sing and get out. She's much more present there now andshe'll take the time.
HuffPo:  And how are you stronger?
Hendryx: How am I stronger? I think I'm much more of a team player than I used to be. And not

most of the writing, so I would pretty much write alone. This time it was much more inclusive and
it was great. I had other people to bounce off of and know what my strengths were as far as what I
bring to Labelle.
HuffPo:  Labelle is legendary for its amazing live shows and the Apollo is about as historic as it
gets. Do you remember the first time you played there?Hendryx:  It was 1961 or 1962. I don't know the exact date but I remember what we wore and
what we performed. I was so naïve that in a way I wasn't impressed but once I walked out on
stage...I was impressed. We walked onstage after Brook Benton and the headliner was Dinah
Washington. And I think the Drifters were on that show. By the end of that show, I was like, "Oh
my God, this is real." We were wearing sailor outfits and singing "I Sold My Heart To The
Junkman" and "Danny Boy" and "Down The Aisle."
HuffPo:  Did you kill?
Hendryx:  We did kill it. What really was the defining moment was when the drag queens and the
boxers at the Saturday night late show stood up and applauded.HuffPo:  You know you're doing alright if you win them over.
Hendryx:  Believe me, you're not doing alright. You have a career .

I was lucky enough to work with Nona and her manager while at Razor & Tie when we released a
cross-label collection titled "Transformation." I was amazed at how talented Nona was, and surprised
she never was able to turn the corner on a super solo career. Hope she has the best of luck on her tour
and it enables her to relaunch more solo works!

Thanks for reading. Hendryx went into so many different genres that she never got her due.
