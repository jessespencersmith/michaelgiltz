9/03/2005 04:30:00 AMHave the people at Fox News lost their minds? Shep Smith andGeraldo condemned in the strongest language possible thefiasco at the convention center. (You have to check out thevideo posted below by John.) And now I'm watching Gretainterview a young man (maybe high school age 16-19 or so).He went to a school yard, commandeered a school bus ("Youstole it," said Greta bluntly), went around picking people upuntil it was full and then drove them to Houston because that'swhere the radio said refugees should go. They pooled money topay for gas. Think about this for a moment. One young manwho had never even driven a bus before in his life acted on hisown and was able to get dozens of people safely away anddrive them to another state. (The laughable finale was thatthey were initially refused entry because refugees weresupposed to show up in Greyhound buses, not school buses.)Greta called his story inspiring.Is she crazy? Doesn't she realize Bush called for zero toleranceof looting? This criminal should obviously be arrested, notcomplimented on national TV. Fox News is going to have a lotto answer for in the coming days.
