<p>COVER STORY ~I -------------------
, , East Village. Rock opera. AIDS. It could be the ul­
timate Cheez Whiz, or it could be something m­
teresting," Tecalls Anthony Happ of his first peek 
at a synopsis of an unproduced stage musical 
caUe4 Rent. He was standing in an obscme of­
fice in the New York headquarters of the powerful ICM talent 
agency, but after a good run on the New York stage and playing 
teen roles in several films, including Dazed and Confused, he was 
about as far from the top of the heap as an ICM client could get. 
"It was September of 1994. I was working at Starbucks-the 
first time I'd had to take a sW"Vival job in New York. There was a 
guy [at ICM] who got upgraded from an assistant to an agent's job. 
I saw the Rent breakdowns on his desk. It was a three-week work­
shop, and [gay stage director] Michael Greifwas directing it, and I 
knew who he was." Happ talked his way into an audition. 
Meanwhile, would-be rock and roller ldina Menzel was between 
gigs as a wedding singer when she heard about the show and 
thought it sounded like fun. And the timing was perfect: Rent was 
going to be workshopped in January and February. There aren't a 
lot of weddings in the dead of winter. "I was just happy to be doing 
theater," says Menzel. "It was my first professional [acting] job." It 
turned out to be much more. 'That New Year's Eve at the Four Sea­
sons in Philly was the last wedding gig I ever did." 
Actor Wilson Jermaine Heredia was not interested in audition­
ing for some workshop production of a rock opera inspired by Pucci­
ni's La Boheme. "It was downtown, it was only going to last a 
month, and I'd just got medical insmance," he recalls. "I was work­
ing full-time as a dispatcher for a realty company, midnight to 9 in the morning. They owned all these buildings and had their own 
maintenance crew. If there was a leak at 2 in the morning, I was 
the person they'd call." Sending out plumbers was a secure gig. 
Singing and dancing in a musical about AIDS? Heredia recalls 
thinking, You know what? I can't afford that. 
But the power of Rent won him over: "When I got the music and 
the script, I got nervous because I loved the project so much." He 
auditioned and was offered the pivotal role of Angel, a mischievous 
drag queen with AIDS and a great sense of rhythm. But he 
dithered, still worried about quitting his job. "My manager called 
me up and was infuriated with me. He said, 'Listen, are you a dis­
patcher? Or are you an actor?' " Heredia says. 
That question woke him up. And soon afterward, Rent woke up 
Broadway and the world. Created by a long-struggling writer­
composer named Jonathan Larson, who wrote the book, music, 
and lyrics, it brought onto the mainstream stage the world of the 
lower east side in New York City-a universe populated with 
homeless people, drug addicts, aspiring performers, drag queens, 
and would-be filmmakers living on the streets or in dodgy lofts 
with no heat. In short, outcasts. But outcasts who had found their 
own sense offamily, their own idea of home. 
In Larson's vision, the La Boheme characters were transformed 
into young New Yorkers, struggling artists, gay and straight [see 
sidebar]. Happ played Mark, the filmmaker and narrator whose ex­
girlfriend, Mameen CMenzel)-an amusing gloss on Laurie Ander­
son-style performance artists-is now dating Joanne, a smart, dri­
ven career woman. Mark lives in an illegal sublet with Roger 
(Adam Pascal), an HN-positive rock musician and recovering ~

songs like "I'll Cover You" (a heart­
breaking same-sex love song), "La Vie 
Boheme," and "Seasons of Love" 
marked a major talent, redefining what 
a musical could be. Larson had turned 
New York's supposedly seamy side into 
a celebration of life and love, and Rent 
turned New York on its head, packing 
successively bigger theaters en route to 
Broadway, a fistful of Tony Awards, 
and the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for drama. ROLE: Mimi

formed long before drugs like the protease inhibitor cocktail would 
lull people into a false sense of complacency about this plague. It 
put queers and drug addicts and people with AlDS at the heart of a 
big-hearted musical. This wasn't Cheez Whiz: Rent spoke to audi­
ences worldwide with the emotional appeal of, say, Les Miserables 
or The Lion King, but it wasn't a noble fantasy of long ago or far 
away. This show celebrated the lives of the very people audiences 
stepped over outside as they made their way into Broadway venues. 
Young people in particular lined up around the block, often 
showing up the night before, to be able to buy $20 tickets in the 
front two rows, which were sold just hours before each curtain. 
Now a big-budget film musical-due out nationwide November 
23-Rent still matters, even if the "Rentheads" who were teens 
when the show began are now pushing 30, and the Broadway cast 
members who re-create their roles in the film-Rapp, Menzel, and 
Heredia along with Pascal, Martin, and Diggs-needed a little 
movie magic to once again embody their 20-something alter egos. 
"We had a nutritionist working with us on the movie to keep us 
healthy and make us look younger and a little hungrier," says 
Rapp. Adds Menzel with a laugh: "Even back then, we were never 
that young." 
The actors knew they had to recapture the sense of despera­
tion that infused the show when it premiered. "It was all raw 
[energy] and spontaneity," says Menzel. Even now, Rapp insists, 
"urgently" is the only way to play these roles, because the stories 
Rent tells, although set 16 years ago (from Christmas 1989 to 
late 1990), have lost none of their immediacy in an America-and a world-where tolerance and respect are still hard-won. 
"We can see that in the last election," says Menzel, talking 
about how important it is to take Rent's message to movie houses 
all over the country. "We as New Yorkers-been there, done that. 
But the rest of the world needs to see people of different ethnicities, 
women loving women, men loving men. The movie is still extreme­
ly relevant because a lot of people still need to be educated." 
And after all, movies have often turned to the recent past to com­
ment on the present: Think Shampoo (a 1975 film set seven years 
earlier), The Deer Hunter (a 1978 film largely set in 1968), or even 
Longtime Companion (a 1990 film that begins in 1981). "It's not 
going to feel like a dated piece," says Heredia. "It's still happening 
and we have to realize that. HIV is not gone. There are casualties 
every single day." 
What will separate Rent the movie from Rent the stage show is 
the medium itself. Onstage Rent was performed on a nearly bare 
stage, with some scaffolding standing in for the grime of the East 
Village, the sterility of a hospital, and the funkiness of a downtown 
cafe. Filming the movie on location in New York and San Francisco 
and on an elaborate backlot in Los Angeles adds a verisimilitude 
that the filmmakers hope will offer a different kind of power. 
The cast felt it, even craved it. Menzel showed up on the set even 
when she wasn't scheduled for that day. She went to support Pascal 
when he was performing "One Song Glory" late at night on a 
rooftop in downtown New York. It was lit so beautifully and the city 
was such a inspiring backdrop, Menzel says, "It just seemed right." 
Rapp had the wonderful and bizarre experience of shooting ~

scenes just blocks from where he used to live. "There was somethlng 
about being on Seventh Street between [avenues] A and B at night 
with the big movie lights and the camera on me," says Rapp. "I 
lived just the other side of Tompkins Square Park from where we 
were. And I was singing this song Jonathan had written with my 
voice in mind. That was the most outcof-body experience where I 
thought,Oh, my fucking God, I can't believe this is happening." 
The translation to film also adds intensity of some intimate mo­
ments, says Heredia. Angel's death from AIDS complications was 
beautifully stylized onstage, at a time when the harsh physical suf­
fering of people with the disease was more 
prevalent in queer New Yorkers' lives and 
more visible in the media. Now, when the 
brutality of AIDS is largely glossed over, the 
movie drives home the reality. 
"The death of Angel is not pretty. It's a 
real hospital scene-lesions and all," says 
Heredia, now 33 and recently divorced. "I 
have to quote Tupac. I can't do it verbatim, 
but he said that the only way people react to 
anythlng is if you show them. Vietnam only 
stopped because people saw it on television. 
So we show it in the film. The only way any­
thlng is going to get better is to put it in your 
face. It's not pretty, is it? It's real." 
How well the cast's experience will trans­
late to moviegoers remains to be seen. The 
completed film was not made available to 
The Advocate at press time, but it is by all re­
ports no carbon copy of the stage show. Songs 
were cut to lower the running time, including 
"Christmas Bells"; the steamy, Bob Fosse-in­
spired "Contact"; and two more Rapp says 
he's not yet allowed to name. And the produc­
tion has been dogged by questions-whether 
director Chris Columbus (of Home Alone and 
Mrs. Doubtfire) can make Rent gritty enough 
to match its subject and setting; whether the 
actors are too old to reprise their roles. 
Rapp is the first to come to Columbus's de­
fense. He had his first feature role in 1987's 
Adventures in Babysitting, Columbus's debut 
as a director, and says he never doubted for a 
minute that 18 years of experience had pre­
pared the filmmaker for just this project. "Having worked with 
[Chris], I knew he had more fire in him, a darker sensibility, and 
edgier sense of humor than he'd shown in his films," Rapp says. 
"One of the things he said in our meeting that was eye-opening to 
me was, 'This is going to be the most important film I ever make.' " 
"Chris's movies are about community and family," says Heredia. 
"Rent is the same thlng. It's not about AIDS, it's not about homosex­
uality, it's not about homelessness-it's about family." 
As for casting six of the eight original principal actors--{)nly 
Daphne Rubin-Vega (Mimi) and Fredi Walker (Joanne) were re­
placed-Rapp says the movie's cast is so immersed in the roles that 
they readily tapped in once again to the sadness and joy inextrica­
bly tied up in Rent. And no one else shares these six actors' experi­
ence of the show's dramatic birth and its creator's shocking death: 
Larson died suddenly the night after the final off-Broadway dress 
rehearsal-January 25, 1996. "We gathered together in the theater that day in shock and not 
knowing what to do," says Rapp, now 34 and in the fourth year of a 
relationship. "We were supposed to have a preview [performance] 
that night [with a paying audience]. The decision came down pretty 
quick from Michael and Jim [Nicola, the artistic director of the New 
York Theatre Workshop] that we were going to do a sing-through of 
the show because we didn't want to leave the theater silent and 
Jonathan's family was flying in." 
The cast and crew invited friends and family to what was sup­
posed to be a sing-through with the cast seated at tables onstage. 
"But by [the act 1 finale] 'La Vie Boheme,' we were up and dancing," 
Rapp says. "Doing it that night brought home, more than it had, 
that there was so much joy and life in the piece, and there is also in­
credible loss and sorrow. And both things are true, and both thlngs 
are as fully realized as the other. To me, part of what the story is 
saying is that in the face of these circumstances you can still live 
your life as fully as possible. 
"Jonathan's father, AI, said to me after that performance, 'This 
has got to be a hit. You've got to make this a hit.' " 
The ironies piled up. Larson, on the cusp of a career-making suc­
cess with a musical that drew its fire from the tragic loss of so many 
talented young people, had died of an untreated aortic aneurysm 
that went undiagnosed after several visits to the emergency room. 
If he'd had the medical insurance Heredia gave up to be in the 
show, he might be alive today. Rapp, the very queer show's sole out 
gay actor in a lead role, was playing the straight narrator. And ~

<p>COVER STORYII------- -----
Rent became a money machine about poor, 
struggling artists, starring once-struggling 
actors who had to fight for what they consid­
ered a fair shake. 
"Here you are, doing a show about art ver­
sus commerce, and we have producers start­
ing to lowball us on money and we have to 
stand up for ourselves," Menzel says, recall­
ing how the original cast fought for and won 
appropriate salaries when the show trans­
ferred to Broadway . "It was such a bitter­
sweet experience for all of us. These wonder­
ful things were happening for our careers 
and yet ... Jonathan wasn't there." 
He wasn't there when his work won the 
Pulitzer in April 1996 nor when it opened on 
Broadway a few weeks later. He wasn't 
around when it won four Tony awards: one 
for Best Musical, two for Larson's book and 
songs, and one for Heredia, the first Domini­
can actor to take home the award. He wasn't 
around for the show's largely sold-out na­
tional tour or its numerous productions 
around the world. He wasn't around when 
Menzel and Diggs married in January 2003. 
He won't be around for the musical's 4,OOOth 
Broadway performance in mid December. 
And he wasn't around to help shepherd 
his creation from stage to screen-a task 
that tempted A-list directors including Mar­
tin Scorsese, Danny DeVito, and Spike Lee. 
By the end of the millerurium-referenced 
in "What You Own," one of the show's rous­
ing rock numbers-the original cast had all 
moved on, remembering Rent as a landmark 
moment in their lives that had come and 
gone. Post-Rent, Rapp has done You're a 
Good Man, Charlie Brown on Broadway, a 
national tour of Little Shop of Horrors, and 
the film A Beautiful Mind, among other pro­
jects. Menzel played the lead in Wicked and 
won a Tony of her own. And Heredia left the 
business altogether , at least temporarily. 
They all followed press reports that Spike 
Lee was talking with celebrities like Justin 
Timberlake, Brittany Murphy, and John HIV then and now 
World AIDS Day. December 1. reminds us why Rent still commands attention. Despite 
major advancements in medical treatment for HIV. the plague continues to expand. 
Here's a brief look at the realities of AIDS when Rent was written-and now. 
GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN HETEROSEXUALS 
• Then: Gay and bisexual 
• Then: About 6% of the 
men accounted for 57% nation's AIDS cases result-
of the nation's AIDS ed from heterosexual 
cases. transmission of HIV. 
Now: Gay and bisexual Now: 31% ofthe nation's 
men account for 42% of AIDS cases are a result of 
• the nation's AIDS cases . 
• heterosexual transmission 
ofHIV. 
NUMBER OF HIV-POSITIVE AMERICANS 
Then: As of 1989, 650,000 Americans were believed to be HIV-positive. 
Now: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 
1.1 million Americans are living with HIV. 
TREATMENT 
Then: • 
Only one anti-HI V drug, AZT, was available. Studies showed that AZT monotherapy was 
largely ineffective and that the virus was quickly able to mutate defenses against the drug. 
Now: ••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 
Twenty-seven antiretroviral drugs are available in four separate medication categories . 
Treatment typically consists of three anti-HIV drugs, with one either a potent protease 
inhibitor, first available in December 1995; or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor, first available in June 1996. (Two drugs will be taken off the market by 2006,) 
DEATHS 
Then: As of the end of 1989,85,128 of Americans with AIDS had died. 
Now: As of the end of 2003,524,060 Americans with AIDS had died. 
Death rates declined sharply after protease inhibitors became available. -Bob Adams

Leguizamo about starring in the Rent movie-just the sort of people 
you'd expect to find in a glitzy film of a hip Broadway show. "I got the last shot of the movie," says Rapp. "It was just a little 
pickup shot of me riding my bike through the backlot of Warner 
Bros. in L.A. and singing, 'We're hungry and frozen.''' He laughs. But Lee moved on, Columbus stepped in, and stunt casting was 
out. Columbus sought out the original performers. "I said, 'Please 
tell this man I don't need a pity meeting,''' says Menzel, who quite 
reasonably doesn't much trust anyone from Hollywood. "I literally 
said, 'I'm really busy and really tired. I understand if I'm too old. 
But I don't want my own time to be wasted.'" Columbus had to 
work to track down Heredia, who had taken a self-imposed one­
year hiatus from acting and was tending bar and working in a video 
store. Rapp, an old friend, needed no persuading. 
Guided by a seemingly magical power only a director of Harry Pot­
ter films could wield, the movie went before cameras in early 2005 
with much of the Broadway cast in place, right up to the final shot. "I knew it was the last shot [to be filmed]. I'm ready; let's do it. 
But as soon as they called it a wrap, I kind of broke down a little. I 
didn't try to hold it in, I didn't know how I was going to feel, but it 
was very overwhelming . Maybe I'm a sappy, sentimental guy in 
some ways, but I went right up to Chris and said, 'Thank you.' 
"I mean, I really needed this to happen in my life. I needed to be 
a part of this again and see it through to the end and have it be for­
ever. It's one of the greatest gifts I could ever imagine to be given 
that opportunity ." •

Rent to own 
Thank you so much for writing such an 
in-depth story about the movie version of 
Rent ["Rent Gets Real," November 8]. As I 
have read many other articles regarding 
the upcoming release, they all seemed 
like sound bites compared with the histo­
ry that was put into your story. As a self­
proclaimed Renthead, I can't tell you how 
excited I am to see this life-changing story 
brought to the big screen. With most of 
the original cast in place, I believe it will 
do exactly what the original play set out 
to do-open eyes, pull the heart strings, 
and preach the power of love.

No excuses 
Jerry Davis states that gay Spokane 
mayor James West is being asked to "step 
down" because of his ''hypocrisy'' [First 
Person, November 8J. Wrong. He's being 
asked to step down because he attempted 
to sell City Hall jobs for sex. That's illegal; 
hypocrisy isn't. I despise West's antigay 
bills, and I wish society were tolerant 
enough to allow him to feel comfortable 
living his life openly. But to blame society 
for West's wrongs is silly. His wrong is 
illegally using his government position, 
not being gay or being a hypocrite.

Road rage 
I was feeling proud and uplifted after 
reading "We're Here to Help" [November

New Orleans. Then a few pages later I 
wasn't feeling so proud anymore and my 
heart sank after reading ''Why I Love My 
Car." In addition to the owners saying 
how great their cars are, you should have 
listed the gas mileage for each vehicle. Of 
the four late-model cars pictured, only 
the VW Beetle gets somewhat decent gas 
mileage. Jennifer Macey has the right 
idea about looking forward to hybrid and 
more environmentally conscious models, 
but in the meantime her vehicle is get­
ting senseless and horrible gas mileage.

caught up in the SUV size wars (size 
queens, indeed) and the myth that "big­
ger equals better," since in reality ''bigger

not "hot."
