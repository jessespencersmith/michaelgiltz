Movies: The Best Films of the 1950s(and 2012!)The IRAs are a mysterious but august film societythat has voted on the best films of the year since1976. More international and indie focused than theOscars, more mercurial than the LA Film Critics,more loyal to their favorites than the GoldenGlobes, the IRAs have just had a weekend inProvincetown, Massachusetts where the winners forthe Best Films of 2012 were voted on andannounced. The IRAs also followed up months ofdiscussion and debate and balloting and re-watching of DVDs and DVRing of TCM to determinethe best films of the 1950s. Below you'll find the listof the Best Films Of The 1950s, followed by ourpicks for the Top Films Of 2012.The IRAs began when passionate film students complained about the annual awards shows,declared "We could do better" and had an all-night, knock-down, drag-out fight to establishthe very first winners of the IRAs. (One of the members is named Ira but how his namebecame the name of the award is a story lost in the mist of time.) The rotating group ofmembers have been profiled in the New Yorker and over the years have included Oscar-winning writers, major directors, top studio executives, best-selling and critically acclaimedauthors on movies, critics and others. They have no more claim to pronounce the best films ofthe year than anyone else but they've been doing it for 37 years so hey, it's tradition.If you're like me, the list will infuriate you -- some movies should be higher up, some should belower down and some shouldn't be on the list at all. That's half the fun. If you're passionateabout movies or TV or books or music or any art form, chances are you've bristled over awardsseason and known you and your friends have better taste. How come Archer doesn't win Best

<p>Comedy? And Breaking Bad Best Drama? Or Borgen? Or The Good Wife?So why not form your own group? It's not just fun to hand out awards; it's the best way tomake certain your youthful enthusiasm for TV or music or books or whatever doesn't losefocus when work and life intrude. When all your friends tell you you have to read such andsuch a book or listen to a certain CD before the annual get-together, guess what? You do!Sometimes homework can be fun.IRAs: The Best Movies of The 1950s1. The Earrings of Madame de... (Max Ophüls, 1953) 1058 pts/81 pts(See note at bottom for explanation of point totals.)2.

<p>100. M. Hulot's Holiday (Jacques Tati, 1953) 255/36Note: The first point total is overall points to establish the order on the list. (Many prior ballotsdetermined the Top 100.) This point total determined what "group" it was in (eg. 91-100, 61-70and so on.) The second point total is for position in that group (eg, among those ten films,which one should be ranked first, which second and so on). Some groups saw very little changein order; others saw substantial fluidity. When two or more films in a group received the samepoint total, we voted to break the tie. For example, "Ordet" and "In A Lonely Place" were tiedfor 10th place but the vote to break the tie placed "In A Lonely Place" in the Top 10 and"Ordet" in the #11-20 group. Even though it originally had the most points of any of thosefilms, the final balloting placed "Ordet" at #13 instead of #11. On the other hand, "The Earringsof Madame de..." ranked #1 from beginning to end.So how many movies have you seen from this list of the 1950s? What movie is missing? Thanksto Criterion for making the Visconti classic Senso available to me so I could catch up with itbefore the final vote. A remarkable number of these movies are in the Criterion Collection, so ifyou want to catch up and are looking for great prints, start with them.THE BEST MOVIES OF 2012BEST PICTUREOnce Upon A Time In Anatolia --- By Acclamation(won a majority of the ballots on the first round)1.

 Fave Share3 Apr 1:15 AMARTICLE AUTHORWell Top 10 is pretty darn good. The "problem" right now for Ozu is thathe has so many terrific movies that different people coalesce arounddifferent films whereas everyone agreed Earrings was the masterpiece ofOphuls. Hence that ranking at #1. The real shocker for me is Kurosawaranking so low but that has to do with the vogue for Ozu and Mizoguchiand Naruse etc. They're being shown a lot at revival houses and discussedso Kurosawa has faded a bit.

 Fave Share1 Apr 10:30 AMFlagNever thought I'd live to see the day when a 'top-100 films of the '50s" listdoesn't contain at least one movie starring Marlon Brando or MontgomeryClift. Rather stunning.Generally, the list is contaminated by that occupational hazard suffered by alltoo many movie critics and film scholars: willfully mistaking undeservedobscurity for "greatness." Things like "The Big Combo" and "It's Always FairWeather," for instance, are certainly good movies that deserve to be seenmore often. But I think the people who made them would be the first to saythat "great" might be a little too strong a word to describe these well-made,entertaining films.In reply to: 3fingerbrown
