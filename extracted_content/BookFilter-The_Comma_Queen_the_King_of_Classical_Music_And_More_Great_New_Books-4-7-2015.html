NortonIs it a memoir? Is it a (gentle) primer on punctuation and grammar? Is it funny? Yes, yes and yes. Mary Norris isthe "Comma Queen" who worked her way up the ladder at the New Yorker, the last bastion of clear and correctwriting. Her delightfully shaggy new book does many things well. It offers a glimpse into the fabled world of theNew Yorker. It tells of her trials by fire -- tentatively suggesting a correction here, wrangling with writers there,receiving words of praise from this famed talent, while getting nowhere with that famed talent who stubbornlyclings to a certain wording because "it feels right." Philip Roth, Pauline Kael and the vivid New Yorker figure ofEleanor Gould are all here.But this isn't a straightforward memoir. The girl can't help herself: Norris playfully dives into various burningissues, such as whether the sentence "Yes, yes and yes" should have a comma after that second "yes," when tosay "Between you and I" (pretty much never) and the purpose of that thingie that looks like an umlaut but isn't. Icouldn't diagram a sentence to save my life. I've never even heard of a copulative verb, and blush to think whatit might suggest. Yet Norris makes it all fun. She's devilishly good at serving up examples of what she's talkingabout in the very sentences she uses to describe something. Plus, it ends with an ode to the No. 1 pencil.What's not to love? Between you and I, I'd be worried about my grammar if I ever spoke to her. (See?) But Ishouldn't be: She's no scold. The Comma Queen makes proper punctuation a pleasure.MICHELLE OBAMA: A LIFE By Peter Slevin $27.95; KnopfDAYS OF RAGE By Bryan Burrough $29.95; Penguin PressIf you want to see how far we've come as a nation, you might pair the first substantial biography of First LadyMichelle Obama with a detailed look at the militant movements of the 1970s, like the Weathermen, theSymbionese Liberation Army and other radicals. It's an eye-opener for those too young who may not realize the</p>

In his critically acclaimed work, Burroughs details the years-long battle between the FBI and these groups determined to overthrow the government.CHU'S DAY AT THE BEACH By Neil Gaiman and Adam Rex $17.99; HarperCollinsThe chameleon-like Neil Gaiman continues his quest to deliver gems in seemingly every corner of thebookstore. Here is a picture book (created with illustrator Adam Rex) that tells the latest escapades of thesniffling, sneezing panda bear Chu when he heads to the beach. Add it to Gaiman's works in fantasy, sci-fi,young adult, fairy tale, graphic novel and various categories he's created all by himself.WORDS WITHOUT MUSIC By Philip Glass $29.95; LiverightAs a lifelong fan of Philip Glass, this memoir is tailor-made for me. Glass might have focused on one key eventin his life -- such as the original mounting of "Einstein On The Beach" or an eye-opening journey to the east. Hemight have delivered his thoughts on classical music and the best way for a would-be composer to preparehimself. Glass could have focused on his childhood, before the music starts in earnest. Instead, he does a littlebit of everything, offering up anecdotes from his youth, like smashing unsold LPs so they could be returned asdamaged goods, telling how during his first audition for Julliard as a flutist, Glass was stopped and told, "Youdon't really want to play the flute, do you?"He tells about the teachers who molded him through fear (Nadia Boulanger) and love (Ravi Shankar), beingbroke after the sold-out success of "Einstein," and on and on. Mixed in here and there are Glass's still scrappydefenses of his music. Sure to be enjoyed by admirers, it's probably too discursive to win Glass some new ones.If you want a good musical introduction to his work, I always send people to the film Koyaanisqatsi or the albumGlassworks. If you're already a fan, be certain you'll enjoy Glass in whatever mode he holds forth here.MIRACLE AT AUGUSTA By James Patterson & Peter de Jonge $28.00; Little Brown and CompanyFALLING IN LOVE  By Donna Leon $26; AtlanticAnyone looking to lose themselves in a book can depend on the latest offering from the shockingly prolificJames Patterson. Working with Peter de Jonge, he returns to the links to deliver a golfing fable about a late inlife champion on the Senior Tour who finds true redemption by mentoring a teen with a natural swing that's athing of beauty. If you're shanking balls into the water hazard, this one's for you. And Donna Leon offers up thelatest, much anticipated Venetian mystery featuring Commissario Guido Brunetti. After dozens of tales, why isthis one especially exciting for fans? Because it features the return of soprano Flavia Petrelli, who was at thecenter of Brunetti's very first mystery, the one that made Leon an international bestseller.To find more great picks in every category (like a bio of Yankees great Billy Martin in sports and the firstcookbook from Austin's legendary Franklin Barbecue), along with ALL the releases in every genre if you're ahardcore fan of romance or sci-fi, head to BookFilter.
