            <p>T U E S D AY,  J A N U A RY  2 9 ,  2 0 0 8Back Door Slam (Again), Nicole Atkins, MikeLeigh and the Blind Boys Of AlabamaA quick update on my outings. Saw Back Door Slam again at theMecury Lounge. The lads were smashing, as always ("Thank you verymuch indeed!") with a few new tunes mixed in, including a cover of theRobert Cray song that gave them their name. (I still prefer my take ontheir name - the Back Door Slam is the sound of kids running out toplay in the summertime.) And word of mouth is tremendous. The firsttime I saw them, there were maybe 15 to 20 people, the next time 30+,the next time even more and this show was crowded. Not quite soldout, but close, I think. Hey, touring still works!Then saw Nicole Atkins at the Bowery Ballroom. Have to admit, when Ifirst heard about the show, I assumed she was opening up for someone.Nicole herself said it was "the weirdes" day of her life. A strong crowdand she joked that she didn't even recognize everyone. (That's whenyou know you're getting somewhere, when the audience isn't just filledup with family and friends.) She has a great voice and is a realperformer. A few of the songs are weak, but she barrels through themand had some great covers: the Doors' "Crystal Ship" and a raucoussing-along with the opening acts finale on Fleetwood Mac's "TheChain." Every indication she'll just get better.Then on Saturday I saw Mike Leigh's new play "2000 Years." Notterribly involving and it certainly didn't help that New York actors weretrying to nail London accents. Without that specifity of location (itmight as well have been East Orange, New Jersey), the play losessomething. Still I doubt an all British cast would have lifted it up toomuch. Seemed to be about a middle aged couple whose son becomesinterested in praying and his Jewish roots much to the chagrin andmocking humor of his parents and sister and grandfather. But there'salso the mother's sister who is mysteriously out of touch for 11 years (orseven!) who naturally reapears in Act Two. A very good melt downscene of family squabbling gave a little late momentum and I sort ofliked the ending, which I didn't see as terribly optimistic as some did.Glad to have seen it and the grandfather (Merwin Goldsmith) wasoutstanding. Glad I saw it but not one of Leigh's stronger efforts.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
