<p>ARTHUR  (2011) -- ($35.99 BluRay or $28.99 regular DVD; Warner Bros.) -- I'll never watch this
remake of Arthur  starring Russell Brand. Heck, I'll never even watch Arthur 2: Arthur On The Rocks ,
the reportedly lame sequel made after the original film's writer-director died. Why spoil the memory of a
movie that should never have been remade in the first place? I'll happily watch a new take on Spiderman
and Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan and all sorts of iconic characters. But some movies just shouldn't be
touched -- not because they're so fragile or precious but because it makes no sense. Remake Casablanca ?
Remake Citizen Kane?  Remake Animal House  or Ghostbusters ? No thanks. Here's my toast to the
original film.  If this remake had received sparking reviews, I might have been in a terrible fix. But since it
got mixed to poor reviews, I can heave a sigh of relief. It has modest extras and a great cast and I look
forward to seeing Helen Mirren and Jennifer Garner and Greta Gerwig and Luis Guzman in other moviesright away.
TORCHWOOD COMPLETE ORIGINAL UK SERIES  ($129.98 BluRay or $119.98 regular DVD;
BBC/2entertain) -- This spin-off from Doctor Who  is more adult, more dangerous and sexier, thanks to a
fine cast led by the terrific John Barrowman as the bisexual, alien-fighting Captain Jack Harkness, leaderof a team of secretive operatives who protect earth from interstellar baddies, all from their home base inCardiff. It's just launched in the US as a rather larkier, jazzed up series on the Starz channel. This boxedset contains all 31 episodes from the original run. It's exciting to see the show get better and better untilthe final 5 episode miniseries "Children Of Earth," a grim, marvelous peak that may very well be the best
run of episodes in Torchwood  OR Doctor Who.
RANGO  ($44.99 combo BluRay pack or $29.99 regular DVD; Paramount) -- Johnny Depp is nothing if
not eccentric and this animated Western reflects his sensibility nicely. It was a modest hit worldwide by
the standards of expensive animated films (just about $250 million worldwide) but ask around and you'llfind an avid core of movie lovers who think this tale of a chameleon taming a town is a keeper. Thatshould be enough for you to put it in your Netflix wish list or pick up a DVD and make sure you give it awhirl.

<p>STARGATE ATLANTIS COMPLETE SERIES ON BLURAY  ($199.99; MGM) -- The Stargate
franchise is certainly the equal of Star Trek  or Doctor Who  when it comes to TV sci-fi properties. This
boxed set of the spinoff Atlantis  has a lot going for it. It's the same price as the regular DVD set (though
on sale you still pay a premium for BluRay) and the DVDs are housed compactly and neatly in slim cases
rather than the horrible packaging of the regular DVD set that fans bemoaned. Loads of extras make this
exactly what I look for in TV boxed sets -- easy to shelve alongside my other DVDs, all the episodes easily
accessible and excellent picture and sound quality.
TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.99 regular DVD; FOX) -- I keep waiting for
Topher Grace to have the career breakthrough he deserves. Grace has yet to match the early peak of In
Good Company,  a smart and adult comedic drama in which he showed the chops of a young Jack
Lemmon. But neither has Grace disappeared. He was Venom in the third and least of the Tobey MaguireSpiderman  movies. He was fine in the anonymous but successful rom-com Valentine's Day  and here he's
trying to make things happen by co-writing the story and executive producing this nostalgia drenchedlook back at 1988 and one wild night when friends from high school reunite four years after graduation
and pent-up desire and rage is unleashed, alongside all sorts of 80s pop classics. (Kudos for getting
producer Trevor Horn to do the score.) It came and went at the box office but Topher Grace will surelystep up to grade A material at some point. Maybe he needs a stint on Dexter  or some other TV series to
open people's eyes to his dramatic range?

<p>HEARTBEATS  ($24.98; Sundance Selects) -- A bisexual  Jules & Jim  with a dash of Wong Kar Wai
thrown in for good measure. The movie is interspersed with people talking about their doomed romances
in faux documentary style, with an Almodovar-esque beauty (one actress has a wonderfully angular face)especially memorable. Then we meet best friends Francis (Dolan) and Marie (Monia Chokri). He's gay
and makes little slashes on his bathroom wall every time a guy turns him down for a relationship (really?
40+ guys wouldn't want him?) and she wears vintage clothing and hangs out with him while they run
down everyone in sight. Like a dappled deer, in wanders Nicolas (Niels Schneider), a tall curly-haired
Adonis who loves ingenuously flirting with both of them. The film is a tug of war between the two, withNicolas either bemused or unaware of their desire. Mostly it's an excuse for Dolan to develop his skills asa filmmaker.This is a huge leap forward stylistically with Dolan telling much of the story through visuals.Dolan and Chokri are inherently appealing but the audience should be given more reason to care forthem; they're so busy being sour and dissing each other that we don't get to warm up to them like weshould. He also finds the perfect ending -- a nice visual moment -- only to tack on a coda that isthoroughly unnecessary. The movie looks great but seems to have been made on a dime, if that makesany sense, which is another good sign. Hopefully Dolan -- who is also acting in other films -- will continuemaking movies at a furious pace and keep pushing himself to grow artistically. He's got a great film inhim and perhaps a great career as well.

<p>revelation to people today. What Kenneth Bowser's film focuses on so well is how Ochs's desire for social
justice both typified his era and perhaps limited him musically and commercially (a mistake Dylan nevercame close to making -- the music always came first with him). Peter, Paul and Mary's 1986 PBS concertspecial is such a staple of pledge drives it seems embedded in the memory. It captures the prefab folkies
at a graceful moment when they were old enough to appreciate their success and relatively young enough
to still capture vocally what made them special. Johnny Winter in 1979 needed to prove the blues still
mattered to him after years of being lured by rock stardom; hence his focus on this German TV concert.
BB King never had that problem -- he's always been steeped in the blues. In 2006 he was in grand old
man mode and had nothing to prove; but that stinging guitar still shines brightly even as he trots through
his familiar numbers. Back in 1986, Gillespie had a rare chance to capture his sound on film; it's also notone for the ages but fans will enjoy the chance to see him on film anyway. And parents who love goodmusic should enjoy watching Yo Gabba Gabba  with their kids. This 3 DVD set contains 12 episodes, each
of them with some very cool songs and great musical guests.

FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL ($16.99 BluRay; MGM) -- A bunch of BluRays, most of themhappily priced below $20, as is right for catalog titles like this. If you're only going to see one Jean-ClaudeVan Damme movie, this tale of an escaped prisoner who can't stop helping others a la The Fugitive  is the
one. The Cutting Edge remains the perfect chick flick when the chick wants to cajole her guy to watch as
well, thanks to D.B. Sweeney as a hockey player turned coach. Better this than Dirty Dancing,  guys. The
Blues Brothers  has never done it for me, though I do enjoy jumping forward to watch legends like Aretha
Franklin in their cameos. Universal has this 31 year old film overpriced at $27. Amelie  remains a quirky
charmer and its visual and aural flair is highlighted better than ever on BluRay. Boyz N The Hood  feels a
little TV movie-ish by this time (to be honest, it did even then), but it's a landmark film and launched Ice
Cube as an actor. Animal House  is 34 years old and also overpriced at $27 but remains sturdily funny
anyway. Finally, Four Weddings and a Funeral  is one of those happy accidents where everything clicked
-- the right script, the right cast, the right star (Hugh Grant in full bumbling charmer mode) and the
result was the best work almost everyone involved would ever do.
