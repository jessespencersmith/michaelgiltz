A very theatrical night for Idol  as they perform
the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. A taped
introduction insisted that "he's composed most ofthe important musicals of our time." Uh, no. Butheck, you could say "he's composed some of themost successful musicals of all time," with Catsbeing surpassed on Broadway only by his ownPhantom of the Opera.  You could say he's
composed "some of the most successful andacclaimed and influential musicals of all time"
and I wouldn't argue with you there, since both those two and others like Evita  and Jesus Christ
Superstar  have gobbled up Tonys and huge box office returns. Really, with all the accolades one
could shower on Lloyd Webber, why say something that in fact is quite debatable? It cheapenswhat he has accomplished by trying to insist on some grand statement that immediately makes youthink, "What about Sondheim?" That's no way to celebrate someone.
SYESHA MERCADO  -- Sang "One Rock N Roll Too Many," a song from Starlight Express  of all
things. Surely one of ALW's most derided shows, it's also been remarkably resilient, especially in
the UK and on the road. (It's a bit of silliness about people on skates pretending to be trains.) Herightly said it was an "interesting choice." Then Syesha belted it out with gusto, looking very sexy ina red dress. She was so relaxed and confident, it was no surprise to find out she's a theater baby.She had a little rough moment on a high note right near the end but finished well and was veryconfident throughout. To my delight, the judges didn't seem to be watching a differentperformance this time. Randy raved and said she could be a huge Broadway star, Paula said "this isyour happy place" and Simon said she was very sexy, spoiling it a little by saying this was one ofher best performances so far. (Syesha looked a little mock peeved when he didn't say it was herbest performance so far, bar none, but to me it looked cute not annoying, though I've been a fan ofhers for a while.) Yes, she went first but this is the week where that stops mattering so much

JASON CASTRO  -- Sang "Memory" from Cats . OK, he's not into theater, but did Jason really not
know that Cats  was about, you know, cats? ALW proved a useful coach throughout, convincingly
saying he was there to serve them, providing good tips and subtly letting us into his opinion, in this
case by saying about Jason's pick: "not sure I would have done it." Translation: don't think he can
pull it off. He does, sort of, crooning the tune in the expected lightweight manner. Very rough on
the low notes in the transition ("burnt out ends of smoky days") and basically getting through it.
Not quite a disaster but not memorable either. Randy plays it off as being a genre unsuited to
Jason, Paula says something nice and Simon nails it by saying Jason looked like someone being
forced to sing a song they didn't want to sing at the family wedding.
BROOKE WHITE -- Sang "You Must Love Me" from the film version of Evita . ALW zeroed in on
my biggest complaint about Brooke: she doesn't pay attention to the words (singing "Every Breath
You Take" like a standard love song instead of the stalker anthem it is, etc.) He said bluntly thatshe didn't have a clue as to what she's singing and then related the story and context of the tune toher, with Brooke looking very weepy as he spoke. She begins the tune and then stops after aboutfour or five words to begin again. The rest of the tune sounds wildly over-deliberate, with Brookeoddly enunciating certain words, getting out of breath, pausing dramatically ("You must...love me!You must love...me!") Nervous and weird, it seems to take twice as long as all the otherperformances. Train wreck, really, and it ends with very tentative, uncertain applause from theusually robotically enthusiastic audience. Randy is very negative. Paula pauses a long time beforespeaking (never a good sign) and then says simply, "You must never start and stop." before giving amixed critique. Simon is very negative and describes her as "tense." To her credit, Brooke didn'tcomment or talk back this time, maybe because it went so poorly her confidence was shot. Ryanasked her what happened and she answered simply that she'd forgotten the words. Ryan askedSimon what he would have done in that situation and Simon said, "I would have done exactly whatshe did," the only positive moment of the entire night for Brooke. Paula said again that you shouldnever stop -- just fake the lyrics and sing whatever comes into your heart -- and Simon said youcan't do that and Randy chimed in that Simon was right. Guess what? They're all correct. Simon isright that to deal with a crisis, stopping and starting over can be the wisest option. But Paula isright that you should never put yourself in that position in the first place and that it would bebetter to fake it for a line and keep on going. Paula is also talking from the point of view of anelaborate live show where everything is choreographed down to lights and fireworks and major setand costume changes. Once that baby gets rolling, you can't just stop and start over (especially ifyou're lip-syncing and doing major dance moves); you've got to keep moving whether it's an arenashow or a Broadway musical.
DAVID ARCHULETA  -- Sang "Think Of Me" from The Phantom of the Opera,  the longest
running show in Broadway history and one of the biggest (if not the biggest) hit musicals of all
time (though The Lion King and that darn Mamma Mia are looking awfully scrappy, they have a
LONG way to go to catch up with Phantom , which is still going strong 20 years after it opened).
ALW said it was "written for a diva" and enjoyed David's take on the tune but had one salient bit of
advice: open your eyes! I hadn't realized how often Archuleta does that, but he admitted it was a
tendency he was trying to work on. Now, along with his lip-licking and breathing, we can watch outfor David and his eyes. The whole segment began very annoyingly with Ryan Seacrest inviting girlsup to hug him which was tacky, rude to the other contestants (stop treating him like he's alreadywon) and unfair to David who quite rightly had no idea how to react -- he's not a plush doll, he's asinger getting ready to perform. Finally, when he did perform, I spent the entire song laughingabout David's constant struggle not to close his eyes, a tic he clearly fought again and again. I was
watching via Slingbox, which doesn't handle rewinding very well, so I saw the entire show in order
without any repeating of musical numbers like I usually do. That said, he was solid and had a very
strong ending. Randy raved, Paula raved and Simon said it was pleasant. That's about right. Not
one of his best but far from weak. (By the way, I lose a bet with myself since I was CERTAIN David
would sing "No Matter What" from Whistle Down The Wind .)
CARLY SMITHSON  -- Sang "Jesus Christ Superstar" from the show of the same name. I've often
thought it was interesting that ALW and Tim Rice did this show after having done Joseph and theAmazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. You think they might have been worried over being pigeonholedas people who write religious musicals. But they ended that talk with Evita , which is ALW's
strongest musical as a whole, with the best book combining with some of his best music and lyrics(by Rice). ALW also earned his money by quickly rejecting Carly's first pick of "All I Ask Of You"

from Phantom  by saying she has a big chest voice (I noticed!) and needed a big dramatic song.
Carly came out in a smashing, fun dress and belted it out with aplomb. My only complaint was on
the chorus -- the background singers overwhelmed her a bit and since she was following them
vocally, I thought she got lost in the mix. In the verses, she was very strong and had a big finish.
Randy was positive, Paula said she especially like the chorus (just to annoy me, I think) and Simon
seemed positive though since she was the fifth of six singers, saying it was one of his favorite
performances of the night was awfully tepid.
DAVID COOK  -- Sang "The Music Of The Night" from Phantom , right down to the vocal tics of
Michael Crawford from the original cast album (at least in the beginning). ALW has buckets of
money and Tony awards but not much critical respect. However, he can be guaranteed to pull outone or two ironclad melodies for every show he does -- tunes that you will remember forever,whether it's "I Don't Know How To Love Him" from Jesus Christ Superstar,  "Don't Cry For Me,
Argentina" from Evita  (see, you can't even read those words without starting to hum it), "Memory"
from Cats  or this song from Phantom . Crawford's original vocals on this tune still get me all tingly.
Cook -- who I was surprised to learn knows his way around a show tune and dug musicals -- simplyknocked it out of the park with his most confident, assured vocal since reworking Lionel Richie's"Hello" and vaulting to the head of the pack. Is there any doubt he'll be in the finals withArchuleta? He hit that big note in the middle tremendously well and did a slightly rockish andeffective key change at the end that let him wail away. It's a huge recovery from being so-so lastweek and a train wreck when he tackled Our Lady Peace's "Innocent" the week before. If I was athome and had this on my DVR, I would save the performance.
THE BOTTOM THREE  -- So who is it going to be this week? Well, Syesha went first but I think
she's going to squeak into the top three past Carly. I predict the bottom three will be Carly and
Jason and Brooke. Jason and Brooke are clearly the bottom two. He was bland but she was an
awkward disaster, so Brooke will be saying goodbye. Talk to me. Jesus was back on Idol but since
no one substituted "Shepherd" for "Jesus" in "Jesus Christ Superstar," I think the non- Idol  fans
will remain away this time.

Carly is officially out. Neither Brooke White nor Jason Castro were in the bottom two. AI has become a
popularity contest, not a singing competition. Very disappointing.

Wow. I'm away from home and the slingbox I'm viewing to watch the show had alreadyerased the results show. I have to say I'm more shocked that Brooke wasn't in the bottom twothan that Carly Smithson went home. Unless you think someone should be in the final two, atthis stage it shouldn't be condemned when anyone goes home. Does the order really matter?The two Davids will be in the finals. Jason and Brooke and Syesha will be saying goodbye in
the next three weeks in whatever order viewers pick.

cont'5. Carly- she looked very nice tonight, covered the tats and sang pretty well. Shouty at times but atleast she looked like she was having fun. Maybe she realizes she won't win and so she's letting herhair down so to speak. 6. David C- for me the best of the night. Sang the song in a very straighforward manner, no shadings ofemo lite. I thought it was a great changeup and now he can go back to what he does best next week. I
disagreed with Simon, I liked this side of David, it was different and showed his versatility. Looking
more and more like a very serious challenger to the other David.
The bottom three will be Jason/Brooke and Syesha. Even though Syesha was very good, she just
doesn't seem to have a big enough fan base at this point of the game. Which is unfortunate since she
could be hitting her stride. But I do think Brooke is gone tonight.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
ALW even looked uncomfortable sitting in the audience, frankly. But then he can go homeand sink into a pile of hundred pound notes, so what does he care?
mch755 See Profile  I'm a Fan of mch755  permalink
Another spot on assesment of the night. ALW was a good mentor, he gave good pointers and was toothe point, not too much chit chat. He did look dreadfully unconfortable at the end of the show on stagewith Ryan and folks. I guess being the man behind the scenes will do that, I had no idea what the guylooked like till this week.As for the singers:1. Syesha- I think she did a terrific job with her song. She was sexy and confortable on stage and itshowed. I do agree that going first at this point of the game won't really matter since there are so few

singers left but it can't help either.
2. Jason- total trainwreck. That pretty much sums it up. This song was way beyond his range and
scope of emotion it wasn't even funny. Would be worst of the night if not for .......
3. Brooke- 2nd trainwreck of the night and an even worst wreck than Jason. She lost total confidence
in herself after that false start and it was painful too watch, but also fascinating at the same time I have
too say. Not sure if her psyche will recover if she manages to get past this week.4. David A- I know you feel he's the inevitable winner of this, but I have to agree with Simon it was
bland and forgettable. I also think he messed up some lyrics though I'm not totally sure. Just dull.
DCDan See Profile  I'm a Fan of DCDan  permalink
Syesha. Spectacular. Ridiculous how sexy she is. And not at all a bad singer either.
Jason. Three words: Put-the-bong-down. Owh, dude, like, I meant, FOUR words . . . Dreadful. It would
be very okay if he went away right about now (make that next week, please, after Brooke).
Brooke. Guess what? I Don't Must Love You. Get out of here with your simpering earnestness.
Enough. And for once Paula was constructive and pithy. In live performance, you never, ever, stop.(Unless you're Elvis Costello on SNL in 1978 doing Radio Radio.) Brooke had her mulligan with thePolice tune. No more free passes.
David A. I really enjoyed his performance of a song I had never heard before. To me, it seems that's
what it's all about: an entertainer being entertaining. Simon, on the other hand, gave his usualdismissive "didn't particularly like it," parenthetically, "cause I don't know the song."
Carly. Not so much. She was greatly assisted by razzle-dazzle lights and quick camera shots. She
seems like a genuinely likeable person though. That helps.
David C. First time I recall liking him. He finally went an entire song without oversinging. All good until
that very last big "rawk" note. A good singer knows he doesn't need to show off his range every timeout.

Thanks for the comments. "I Don't Must Love You" def the comment of the week. :) Andnamecheckng Elvis Costello in an SNL performance -- bonus points for that one.

Jason, Brooke and David A. He is getting more forgettable every week.Either Jason or Brooke gets the boot. The other gets one more week.

With all of the amazing songs attributed to Andrew Lloyd Webber, the contestants made a lot of bad
choices, I thought.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Actually, that was an issue I didn't tackle but I think you're right. Archuleta's choice a bit oddand now in retrospect Jesus Christ Superstar -- which is a good song in the context of a bigrousing production number -- isn't so good as a solo tune. Has anyone covered this songoutside a huge concert staging of the musical? I don't think so. And "Memory" is one of thefew bombastic ALW numbers so it was maybe the easiest choice for Castro, but clearly didn'tdo him any favors.
DCDan See Profile  I'm a Fan of DCDan  permalink
"Superstar" did pretty well for Murray Head in the context of a 45 rpm. The single,released from the original soundtrack, went Top 20 in U.S. 1971.

Comments are closed for this entryHowever, I agree with you, it didn't work well for Carly in this case. Having said that,
it certainly wasn't the worst performance of the night and she didn't deserve to getbooted for it. For once, Randy came up with something salient: it's coming down topopularity and fan-base size (if it wasn't already all along). The fact that Syeeshawas second from the bottom -- after giving almost inarguably the best performanceof the night, especially within the framework of a true Broadway production number -- certainly substantiates Randy's assertion. Doesn't matter what Syeesha does, howgreat she looks, or how well she performs; she won't win.
Carly would have been better served covering "I Don't Know How to Love Him"
(ditto Brooke) rathering than channeling Amanda Overmeyer in a lame attempt toearn her Rocker Chick bona fides. The whole thing was shrill and redundant.

Syesha ruled the night. Sucked they put her on first. Castro was painful. Brooke is done. See ya. And Ihope I never hear the phrase "G-rated nanny" again for the rest of my life.

I disagree with your bottom three pick.
I think Carly's performance was much more exciting and memorable than Syesha's performance.
Syesha has bored me to tears this entire season. 
I think the bottom three "should be" and "will be" as follows:Brooke, Syesha, and JasonWith Brooke going on home.Carly, David A., and David C. will be safe and rightfully so. 
The contestants from American Idol 7 are by far the most void of personality than any other season so
far. I hope next season they look for singers that also have some personality. Danny Noriega had themost personality of all the Idol 7 contestants.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
You're certainly not alone in being bored by Syesha since the judges and the voters seem toagree with you. This group doesn't seem to have any sharp edges personality-wise, which isironic since this season the producers devoted themselves to....staying more focused on thecontestants. Danny Noriega had oodles of personality, but for me David Hernandez had abetter voice than half the people in the final six.

Thanks, kls9331. I thought I was the only one whot hought Brooke was a loser from thebeginning. such a phony! No voice, no stage presence, no understanding of the lyrics.Please--let her go tonight and let the audience out of its misery.Carly was fantastic and so was Sayesha. David Cook is really doing an amazing job amongthe male contestants. Glad he got his mouth under control and got the purple out of his hair.
