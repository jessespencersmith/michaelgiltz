DVDs: Chris Pine's "Finest Hours" (So Far), Savvy
Horror Flick "The Witch" And The Overlooked "CopRock"
06/01/2016 01:30 am ET  | Updated  Jun 01, 2017
The summer has been a little slow in terms of DVD/BluRay releases. But this time we can watch Chris Pine
become a star, Zac Efron continue to become an actor and the infamous/cult favorite TV show Cop Rockfinally get its due.
DVDs: Chris Pine's "Finest Hours" (So Far), Savvy Horror Flick "The Witch" And The Overlooke   </p>
<p>THE FINEST HOURS  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Walt Disney Studios)
THE WITCH  ($24.99 BluRay combo; Lionsgate)
Actor Chris Pine became a movie star this summer. He did it at the Cannes Film Festival where the crime noir
flick Hell Or High Water  demonstrated Pine could carry a movie and have that certain magnetism movie stars
offer in something other than Star Trek.  Sure, he's made other films, even some hit films. He's even tried to
launch a second or third franchise. But nothing quite captured the magic and charisma he's capable of untilHell Or High Water.  Not that a down and dirty movie like that is going to become a blockbuster. But it's the sort
of film stars like Harrison Ford made in between tent poles like Star Wars  and Indiana Jones.  if you're
wondering what I'm talking about, check out The Finest Hours.  This square-jawed, old-fashioned Disney movie
about a daring rescue at sea displays Pine in fine form. Oh, what the classic studio system could have donewith this guy, tossing him into a new movie every month -- comedies, dramas, action, adventure, crime andso on -- until they figured out where he worked best. If you're in the right mood, you can appreciate thewholesome conviction Pine displays here. This might have been the film to set his career on fire in a new way.A few years from now, you might watch The Finest Hours  and wonder why it didn't.
Similarly, The Witch  looks like a spring-pad for all sorts of talent. It's a low budget horror film about colonial
America, where a family living on the edge of a haunted wood is bedeviled by trouble. Writer-director RobertEggers really delivers the chills here in a story that's more spooky than gory. The look of the film is fantastic,especially the cinematography of Jarin Blaschke. (When you want to check out a film because of thecinematographer, you know he's special. Blaschke is.) The actors are top-notch too, obviously led by AnyaTaylor-Joy as the daughter who may or may not be in league with Satan. The tension here is wonderful, soit's a pity the film is a let-down at the finale. our heroine is beset on all sides. Whatever happened -- whethershe defeated the forces of evil, joined them or was in league with them all along -- I wanted her to be anactive player. Instead, after an entire movie in which Taylor-Joy seemed smart and capable, she became</p>
<p>merely a pawn with no real choice in the climax. That doesn't keep this from being a very impressive effort
from all concerned.</p>
<p>THE LAST PANTHERS  ($39.99 BluRay; Acorn Media)
OUTSIDERS SEASON 1  ($24.96 DVD; Sony Pictures Home Entertainment)
MAJOR CRIMES SEASON FOUR  ($44.98 DVD; Warner Home Video)
Three tight, smart TV shows for crime fans. The Last Panthers  is a British miniseries with an embarrassment of
talent on display. A continent-sprawling story of jewel thieves of a certain age, it stars John Hurt, Samantha
Morton, Goran Bogdan and the brilliant Tahar Rahim. They are perhaps better than the material but it's fun ifserious stuff and they have a ball.
For those jonesing for motorcycle-based crime shows (is there such a sub-genre) now that Sons Of Anarchy  is
gone, here comes Outsiders . It's not a biker gang, just Kentucky mountain folk who live extremely far off the
grid and like it that way. Leave them alone. Seriously. But people won't and the black sheep who tried to
break away is back and may be their best hope at preserving a brutal life apart. And there are bikes. Andguns. And tattoos.
A little less convoluted is the procedural pleasures of Major Crimes.  Sure there's a season-long arc but this
spin-off/extension from The Closer  has Mary McDonnell as the calm yang to the yin of Kyra Sedgwick's now
long-departed head of the Major Crimes unit. McDonnell is wonderfully self-possessed throughout. While the
show isn't a patch on Battlestar Galactica  or, frankly, as enjoyably eccentric as The Closer,  it's good to have
McDonnell's intelligence on display.</p>
<p>THE NAKED ISLAND  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion)
MANHUNTER COLLECTOR'S EDITION ($34.93 BluRay; Shout! Factory)
THE FILMS OF MAURICE PIALAT  ($49.98 BluRay; Cohen Media Group)
If Criterion releases it, I wanna see it. Usually it's a classic work I get to revisit. Sometimes it's a movie I've
read about for years but never actually seen. When it's a movie I've never even heard of, I know I need towake up and check it out pronto. That's the case with Japanese director Kaneto Shindô's 1960 film The NakedIsland.  It doesn't strike me as an out and out masterpiece, like so many films Criterion has introduced me to in
the past. But it's a distinctive, memorable work I'm delighted to get under my belt. Nearly a silent movie, ittells the wordless story of a family surviving on a tiny island off of Japan. A husband, a wife and their twosmall boys labor day in and day out just to get by. The husband and wife row in darkness to a nearby islandjust to get buckets of water. They return, labor up a steep, crumbly path to their home, store some water incisterns for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Then they return to the other island and do it all over again so theycan water the modest crop the family grows in tenuous rows clinging to the side of the hills on their smallpatch of land. And then they do it again. And again. All of this is told in simple, almost documentary style(though the actors are trained, not locals). Criterion's supplements (from a director interview to anappreciation by actor Benecio Del Toro) illuminate the post-war context of the movie, how Shindôrevolutionized the independent film industry and so on are great. But you can appreciate this elemental tale aspure cinema, a universal story related with disarming ease.
Manhunter  might seem leagues away from The Naked Island.  But both films thrive in the quiet moments.
Manhunter  is Michael Mann's adaptation of a Thomas Harris novel that preceded The Silence Of The Lambs.
It's a terrific film and easily William Petersen's career highlight, here playing the FBI profiler who becomes
disturbingly immersed in the minds of criminals. Petersen, Kim Greist, Joan Allen and Brian Cox (as the firstHannibal Lecktor) are all impressive. But the most memorable turn is Tom Noonan, an excellent stage talent</p>
<p>and film director in his own right. He plays a serial killer desperately trying to make a human connection. When
the movie pivots to his point of view and makes us empathize and feel for this ultimately vicious character, it'sa truly remarkable accomplishment. It's a very worthy companion piece to Jonathan Demme's Oscar winnerand this new edition is bursting with extras and a director's cut.
And to switch gears one more time, director Muarice Pialat does not fall trippingly off the tongue of even
many film buffs who certainly know their Truffaut and Godard. Pialat only made ten films, four of them starredGerard Depardieu and three of his movies are contained here. You get a mother dying of cancer in The MouthAgape,  high school students facing a future of unemployment (or worse, miserable jobs) in Graduate First  and
Depardieu as the Pialat-like Loulou , a wastrel who wins the girl but can't be bothered to change his petty
criminal ways. The movies savor long takes, quietly observant scenes and an unsentimental worldview. Abonus feature delves into the cinematic sensibility of Pialat.</p>
<p>DIRTY GRANDPA UNRATED  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Lionsgate)
GODS OF EGYPT  ($35.99 BluRay combo; Lionsgate)
Two bad movies, one that's fitfully funny and should have been better and one that's just bad and should
have been worse. I may be the only person who had high hopes for Dirty Grandpa. I was down for a stupid,dumb comedy that critics overlooked because they wanted "plot" or "character" or something high brow like alitany of dick jokes that were actually funny. Screw that! I just wanted to laugh! I was eager to laugh. DirtyGrandpa  rarely allowed me to law, except in bewilderment and how dumb it was in not being able to achieve
enjoyable dumbness. Zac Efron is an uptight lawyer about to be married to sexless, hatefully controllingfiance. His dad is the equally bland and uptight Dermot Mulroney. Grandpa Robert De Niro used to be a bigpart of his life but has been out of the picture for years. When grandma dies, De Niro guilts Efron into a roadtrip from Atlanta to Daytona Beach, Florida. Ostensibly it's to play golf or something. But really dirty Grandpawants to loosen Efron up and keep him from marrying this awful girl and having a miserable life. Oh andGrandpa sure would like to sleep with a college girl. In about two minutes they bump into the girl EfronSHOULD be with (a college friend who shares his passion for photography) and her best friend (Aubrey Plaza)who is really really into old guys. That makes the film sound far more sensible than it is. De Niro and Plazahave a fun time going at each other. BUt since they meet five minutes in and she practically spreads her legsat hello, why the heck does De Niro talk as if getting her will be some difficult challenge. She is definitely openfor business, grandpa! Efron is game, despite idiotic clothes that beat us over the head with how lame he is.The two leads have some good banter. But this flick could have been dumb in a much smarter way and a lotmore fun.
On the other hand, I'd rather watch it again than Gods Of Egypt  which may be campy fun for someone
somewhere, but life's too short for that sort of thing. The special effects are weirdly ineffective, the casting
absurd and the story witless without even the awareness of Dirty Grandpa  which at least knows it's witless.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
<p>LOU GRANT SEASON ONE  ($39.97 DVD; Shout! Factory)
THE UNTOUCHABLES COMPLETE SERIES  ($89.98 DVD; CBS Home Video/Paramount)
HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL COMPLETE SERIES  ($84.98 DVD; CBS Home Video/Paramount)
COP ROCK: THE COMPLETE SERIES  ($29.93 DVD; Shout! Factory)</p>
<p>Should I say it again? Where is the complete I'll Fly Away  and The Paper Chase  and about a million other TV
shows that deserve to be available in boxed sets with their entire run ready for perusal? Other than
convoluted music rights and the such (the bane of shows like WKRP  and The Wonder Years  et al for many
years), it remains a mystery why some shows are available and others have disappeared. Take Lou Grant.  One
of the more acclaimed dramas of the 1970s, it's an Emmy winner featuring one of the most belovedcharacters in history. It also co-stars Nancy Marchand who had a late career peak with The Sopranos . But it's
taken ages for us to get even Season One out on DVD. The show wore its (bleeding) heart on its sleeve evento my 11 year old sensibility back in the day and hasn't aged particularly well. Yet I'm thrilled to actually knowthat rather than wondering if my memory is right. And anyone who cares enough to buy season one wouldsurely want to whole show, so it's a shame we're not getting all five years at once.
It's no surprise to see The Untouchables  repackaged in a nice neat boxed set. Like Lou Grant, it wanted to
right wrongs. Unlike Lou, it thought the pen might be mightier than the sword but neither was a match for the
tommy gun. One of the most violent shows of its era, The Untouchables  was ground-breaking in its way and a
career peak for Robert Stack.
I'll take Have Gun, Will Travel  any day, however. It has the noble instincts of Lou Grant, the cynical awareness
of how the world really works of The Untouchables and the good taste to let our gun for hire be a cultured
man of leisure. There's no reason why do-gooders have to always toil at low-paying jobs like reporters orcops, is there? Only fanatics will watch all 225 episodes from its six year run. But dip in anywhere and you'llbe pleasantly entertained.
As for Cop Rock,  I would love to report it's an unappreciated gem. The truth is that it seemed a bewildering
mess to me when it debuted in 1990 and it remains a (less) bewildering mess today. It's deeply ambitious,
almost crazily so and can now be appreciated for the bold step forward it was from creator Steven Bochco.Even at the time, you knew it was a memorable experience for all involved. How could it not be? It's cheeringto hear the cast celebrate their work today and rightly so. Essentially, this was Hill Street Blues  with musical
numbers. Crazily, they recorded the performances live on set in most cases, which explains why vocals (surelysweetened at some points) felt a little unpolished even to my untrained ears back then. They delivered fiveoriginal tunes an episode, which is truly daunting when you think of a terrific show like Crazy Ex-Girlfriendstruggling to come up with two good numbers per episode today. What works? The drama, to a degree. Thisis clearly the bridge between Hill Street Blues  (the most influential and important drama of all time) and
Bochco's darker NYPD Blue.  (It's also the bridge between The Singing Detective  and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. ) It was
also a bold step forward in bringing musical theater into TV, a gambit paying dividends everywhere today fromGlee to those live TV musicals. Cop Rock  wouldn't seem nearly so disconcerting today. Of course, if it lasted
more than eleven episodes they would have figured out how to incorporate the songs better so they wouldpush the story forward rather than often repeat what we already knew. They'd also learn how to make thesongs move. So often, the musical numbers were visually static since they were probably exhausted justgetting the songs on their feet. And the hardest part would be maintaining the quality of the five songsdelivered by Randy Newman for the pilot. If we got numbers like the terrific "Guilty" (a jury's verdict sung byformer members of The Temptations) and Kathleen Wilhoite's "Sandman" included in that first episode, we'dstill be talking about this show. To be clear, even the pilot isn't truly satisfying. But TV Guide  calling it one of
the worst tv shows of all time is patently absurd. It's smart, it's ambitious, moments of it are thrilling and whenit falls flat on its face that's only because Cop Rock  is trying something so very, very hard. Getting to see it
again all these years later when its trail-blazing has borne fruit is a pleasure. Watching the nutty finale (wherethe cast and crew break down the fourth wall and join in a sing-along that dispenses with plot and character</p>
<p>altogether) is a joyous, what the hell moment.
