This is how it works in the new Hollywood: Smart 
young actors like Tobey Maguire and Matt Damon 
make well-received blockbusters like "Spider-Man" 
and "The Bourne Identity," and that box-office suc­
cess powers their ability to make challenging mov-
ies that solidify their status as serious guys (see Damon in "The De­
parted" and Maguire in the upcoming "The Good German"). 
Christian Bale is following this game 
plan -though he wasn't afraid to get se­
rious before he got a superhero . One of 
the few stars to jump from child actor (in 
Steven Spielberg's 1987 wwn drama 
"Empire of the Sun") to adult roles, the 
Welsh actor strutted and scared in "Vel-vet Goldmine" (1998), "American Psycho" 
(2000), "Laurel Canyon" (2002) and "The 
Machinist" (2004). But last year's hit "Bat­
man Begins" has taken him to a new lev­
el: "The Prestige," in which he and Hugh 
Jackman play dueling magicians, was 
tops at the box office when it opened a 
Bale, clockwise 
from above, as 
Bruce Wayne in 
"Batman Begins"; 
a WWII POW in 
"EmlJire of the_ 
Sun"; the titular 
j't\merican Psy~ 
clIO"; and all Iraq 
war vet in uHarsh 
Times" (with 
Freddy Ilouriguez) few weeks back. 
This Friday, he returns to tough stuff 
with "Harsh Times," wnter-director 
David Ayer's action drama about an Iraqi 
war veteran who meets up with an old pal 
(Freddy Rodriguez) and pulls them both 
into shady deals, violence and despair. 
For Bale, 32. the role is both another 
chance to show off his acting chops, and a 
return to risky business. 
" 'Harsh Times' was a perfect antidote 
to working on movies for seven months," 
says Bale, speaking of labor-intensive 
flicks like "Batman Begins," "The Prestige" 
and the 2005 epic "The New World." 
"Coming off of things like that. and then 
doing something like 'Harsh Times' in 24 
days -and on top of it, doing it with some­
one like David Ayer, who [did] 
what everybody says you should 
never do, which is fund the movie, 
"The movie came out of his own 
pocket," Bale continues , "He had 
the opportunity to go through stu­
dios. But he didn't like what they 
were telling him, the changes he'd 
have to make. So he remortgaged 
his house and stuck the money up. 
That's what I loved." 
Bale's take on "Batman," oddly, 
seems to fall into that category of 
doing what he loves, precisely be­
cause his approach was very un­
studio. After almost a decade of 
edgy, indie or out-there roles, Bale 
and director Christopher Nolan 
both knew the actor had what it 
took to re-energize the franchise . 
"I didn't try to talk Chris No­
lan into giving me that role," Bale 
, says. "It was more like, 'Look, this 
is what I wantto do, what do you 
think of that? Is it going to fit with 
your rdea of the film?' ... And so, I and now 'Harsh Times' 
was able to make a movie in that case that 
I really like. 
"So often with [bigger movies]. details 
go out the window, and that's disappoint· 
ing," Bale continues _ "Why, when it has a 
higher budget, do [moviemakers] have to 
eradicate what makes stories so interest­
ing? I love blowing stuff up as much as the 
next person, But after awhile, you just feel 
like you're watching somebody else playa 
video game." 
True to form, Bale hasn't followed his 
commercial breakthrough simply with 
more blockbusters While "The Prestige" 
had director Nolan, "X-Men's" Hugh Jack­
man and starlet Scarlett Johansson at­
tached, and he's about to go behind the fa­
mous mask again for the Bat -sequel "The 
Dark Knight" (co-starring Heath Ledger as 
the Joker), doing "Harsh Times" and direc­
tor Werner Herzog's upcoming war film 
"Rescue Dawn" are projects Bale says he's 
been eying for years. ' 
As Ayer, who earned his bones as the 
screenwriter of the Oscar-winning "Train­
ing Day," put it, "Christian actually picks 
roles. He's not chasing business situatIOns 
-he's chasmg material," 
A few of the projects Bale will chase in,-, 
clud€ a remake of the 1957 Western "3:10 
to Yuma," and the musical drama ''I'm Not 
There," which will co-star Cate Blanchett, 
Richard Gere, Michelle Williams and Juli­
anne Moore. And while the latter film will 
utilize the music of Bob Dylan, and Bale . ~ ~ 
plays a follne who finds God, he asserts it's ii, 
not a biopic. Nonetheless, it's the first time, ~ 
Bale will sing on -screen since the 1992. ,Y ,i: 
Drsney musical "Newsies," an early part ., 
he good-naturedly mocks before admitting' 
that he'll "try anything once" 
Which may explain his eagerness (0 
work with the notoriously adventurous 
German director Herzog ("Fitzcarraldo," 
"Grizzly Man") The actor says "Rescue 
Dawn" was exactly the outrageous experi­
ence he was hoping for 
"That wasn '( a standard film shoot," 
laughs Bale 'We were ill a j lIngle in Thai­
land, and would find ourselves many 
mornmgs with half the movie's crew gone 
So everybody took on different .lobs to get 
by for a few days. Hall the bloody crew 
walked out, and we .lust kept going' 
"But there were toenails beirrg e}"1:ract­
ed and people being washed down rapids 
half-drownmg , and at one point I had to 
pick up live snakes in the middle of a river 
"You know. it didn't disappoint" ¢></p>
