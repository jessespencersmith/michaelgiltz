            <p>Moment of spoof
he comedy 'Airplane!" wasn't the first movie to
lovingly spoof a genre - everyone from Abbott &
Costells to Mel Brooks had done it before.
But somehow the Zucker brothers (David and Jerry)
and Jim Abrahams turned it up to 11 with that mashup
of the 'Airport" movies, "Zero Hourl' and Monty Python's
sensibility.
"Superhero Movie" (opening Friday) is the latest offspring
of 'Airplane!" and checks another item off the list of movies
waiting to be spoofed.
(Slasher movies? Check. Disaster movies? Check. "Benji,"
"Lassie," "Flipper" and other animal movies? Hmmmm.)
Here are five landmarks in the movie spoof genre.
MichaelGil2> SCARY MOVIE(_?_0.9*9t_"_"._...."._,"....._
The sctrp: This
parodies "Scream,"
i itself a knowing
i parody of slasher
i movies. The Wayans
i clan is behind it, and
i like so many gross-
i . out comedies today,
i the "Scary Movie"
i franchise was always
i sure to include at
i least one scene
i that would push the
i envelope of bad taste.
i lte purdr &rc: Yes,.
i you can spoofaspoof.  AIRPTANE! (1980)
The sefup: Start with airplane disaster movies. Throw in
pop cultural references like "Saturday Night Fever" and "From
Here to Eternity" with feverish abandon. Add veteran actors like
Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielsen.
Tfte rurdr line: Massive box office success, spinoffs,
sequels, deals for TV shows. Surely this is the gold standard of
movie spoofs.
r TOPSEGRET!(1984)
The setup: Cross Elvis
musicals with a World War ll spy
flick. Put Val Kilmer in the lead,
don't forget the flying cow, and
whatever you do, make sure the
title has that exclamation ooint!
The puitdt line: Solid proof
that the Zuckers and Abrahams
weren't one-joke wonders.
il: l{ _qg,.l!"ltt clr""yoJ svc54 ( lq88l,
The sefup: Keenen lvory Wayans wrote, directed and starred
as Jack Spade avenging the death of his brother, and taking on
Mr. Big with the help of Jim Brown, lsaac Hayes and even Chris
Rock - as a guy eating ribs in a restaurant.
The punch line: The blaxploitation sendup launched a
comedy dynasty, with Wayans overseeing the landmark TV
show "ln Living Color" and his siblings exploding in popularity.fhe pundr Iine: When Mel Brooks and Monty Python w4â‚¬
lovingly skewering the films they admired, these guys were*at
boys in the back row throwing popcorn. Soon, those smarF
aleck comments would make them rich and famous. i r;i: . :</p>
