 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Hair" Back On Broadway;
Hannibal Lecter Sings!
HAIR  *** out of ****
SILENCE! THE MUSICAL  * 1/2
HAIR  *** 
ST. JAMES THEATRE
As the ads say, Hair  is back on Broadway for the
summer of love in a limited engagement. A seminal
counter-culture movement used as a marketing hook?Groovy! What's striking about Hair  on a second viewing
in its current incarnation is how a show that wasprobably shocking and envelope-pushing at everymoment when it was born (interracial sex,
homosexuality, casual drug use, cross-dressers, anti-war,
full frontal nudity and on and on) feels so innocent and wholesome now.
It is directed by Diane Paulus, who managed to turn a dusty relic with only two truly outstanding musical
numbers ("Aquarius" and "Let The Sun Shine In") into a fresh production with some depth and emotionalheft. It began more than two years ago in Central Park. So it's no surprise that the current versionplaying through September feels exactly like what it is: the latest road version of a hit revival. Anyonewho saw the original electric cast will find it lacking a bit. Anyone coming to it fresh will be able toappreciate how the show was spruced up and an eager, generally solid cast. If nothing else, it joins CatchMe If You Can  as one of the sexiest shows on Broadway right now.
I actually avoided the show when it transferred to Broadway. I couldn't imagine the performance I saw inthe ideal setting -- the middle of New York City under the stars -- could be improved on. But all the

<p>reviews insisted the show remained effective and they're right. The cast bursts through the exits from the
street to begin act two, they cavort about as much as ever and if you're in an aisle seat, you can expectyour hair to get tousled and toyed with repeatedly by the hippies. Interactive theater gives me the heebie-jeebies and the flower power aura of the show is far from my comfort zone. But you'd have to be a realstick in the mud not to loosen up a little. And it was worth it to see the senior citizen in front of me getinto the spirt of things and start tossing flowers he was handed across the aisle and up and down the rowwith abandon, startling other theatergoers and amusing himself (and me) to no end.
It's a shame they didn't take this opportunity to cast the show with age appropriate actors. I think seeing
actual teenagers would give their eager embrace of platitudes a new poignance and the harsh finale even
more punch. But if you missed it and want to see what the fuss was about, Hair  is still solid enough in its
concept and execution to satisfy. Here's the original cast performing on David Letterman.
NOTE: Hair  is staying true to its progressive spirit by working with Broadway Impact . The show spoke
out in favor of basic rights for all Americans by championing marriage equality for gays and lesbians
around the country. They'll demonstrate solidarity by hosting several gay marriages of members of theBroadway community onstage July 25 right after that night's performance. Cast members will also host abe-in to raise money for  Broadway Impact  (a group fighting for marriage equality for all citizens) at
Rockwood Music Hall on July 24.
SILENCE! THE MUSICAL  **
THEATRE 80
Context is everything. Stumbling upon a YouTube video that features a number from a proposed musical
version of The Silence Of The Lambs  was probably fresh and hysterical. Seeing the show mounted in an
early form at the NYC Fringe Festival back in 2005 was worth a chuckle as well, making it a gameshowcase for some talented actors and the creative team.
But now Silence! The Musical  has been around for six years, played in London and is mounted with a fine
professional cast. Whatever modest possibilities the concept had have been thoroughly worked over; the
joke has been done to death.
As in the movie, the man playing Hannibal steals the show. In this case, it's Broadway actor Brent Barrett
who has delicious fun as the magnetic and ruthless killer. He delivers his numbers with aplomb and hislines with exceptional comedic flair. If there's any reason to seek this out, he's it. Jenn Harris is nearly hismatch as Clarice Starling, but her voice is far inferior, which may be the reason our heroine has so fewsongs to sing. A little less mugging would help, but she generally does a dead-on parody of Jodie Foster's
Oscar-winning role. The other standout is Lucia Spina who plays both Buffalo Bill's latest victim and that
woman's mother, a powerful Senator. If Jon and Al Kaplan (who did the music and lyrics) have a futurein musicals, it's because of the number the Senator sings in her plea to Buffalo Bill, a song in which sherepeats her daughter's name over and over to personalize his victim and make it harder for him to kill.The song is marvelously sung, very much in character, not "jokey" but very funny and also quite catchy.

<p>moves the plot along as well, accomplishing everything a musical number should do.
That's about it. Most of the show is filled with songs that are ummemorable and poorly sung. (Though
Deidre Goodwin has fun with her one brief moment in the spotlight and shows she indeed has some pipes
too.) The Book Of Mormon  and Avenue Q  proved dirty songs can be funny and memorable. But being
dirty isn't enough. Hearing Buffalo Bill sing "F--- me hard" isn't amusing in and of itself, unless you're 12years old. Similarly, Clarice's father sings a pointless tune and it too has one joke about how boring it is
to be dead. That joke is repeated again and again (and then again  when it is reprised). Ditto for one of
Hannibal Lecter's songs, which is amusing at first but leaned on once too often.
So Silence! The Musical  has too many weak numbers with even good ones beaten to death in a show that
wouldn't be better at 80 minutes but would at least provide a more pleasant evening rather than its
current padded state of 2 hours. Sometimes a simple parody works just fine as that: a simple little
parody done online via one or two songs. Very few skits on Saturday Night Live  get turned into movies
and most of the ones that do shouldn't have been. The same is true of musical parodies: a little goes a
long way and a longer one ultimately offers very little. Here's the cast discussing what other moviesthey'd like to see turned into musicals.
