Cavett DVD captures legends 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
TALK show legend Dick Cavett 
can't play an instrument, can't 
really sing and never really lis­
tens to rock 'n' roll. 
But rock stars loved him. 
"Dick' Cavett: Rock Icons" 
(Shout; $39.98) is the fust in a se­
ries of DVD boxed sets that pres­
ents complete, uncut episodes of 
Cavett's E..mmy-winning talk show. 
It's filled with performances and 
interviews with rockers like Jeffer­
son Airplane (just back from 
Woodstock), Stevie Wonder, Paul 
Simon, Sly & The Family Stone, 
George Harrison, the Rolling 
Stones, Janis Joplin and others. 
"I don't know why they all 
agr~.e;dj:Q. ,come "()Ii my show," says " 
Cavett, who once hit the cover of 
Time but admits he was so clue­
less about the rock lifestyle (ie. 
drugs) that his staff had to expl.ain 
what the paraphernalia the rockers 
left behind was used for. 
One hilarious interview finds a 
nervous and very fey David Bowie 
stroking a cane and sniffing very 
loudly throughout his interview. 
Cavett insists he was naive 
about the goings-on behind the 
scenes of these shows, which were 
taped in a Brojldway house iri the 
early '70s just around the corner 
from the Ed Sullivan Theatre 
(where David Letterman's "Late 
Show" is taped today). 
"Does sniffing indicate coke? I'm 
so innocent. I could never really 
tell," says Cavett. "I knew some­
thing was operating besides them­
selves, but I never knew quite what 
it was or how to spot the variety of 
available drugs. . .. " . 
But tellingly, what Cavett re~ 
members most about Bowie was an 
unexpected and poignant response 
to a question about his mother (Bo­
wie's father had already died). 
"I think she has a day job," said 
Bowie. And how does she explain 
her son to friends? "I think she pre­
tends I'm not hers," he says. tfter 
laughing a bit nervously, Bowie 
adds, "We were neVer that close, 
particularly. We have an under­
standing." 
Coming next month is a set de-Old TV pearl: Janis Joplin with her 
favorite interviewer, Dick Cavett. 
voted to frequent guest Ray 
Charles and, in November, one de­
voted to John Lennon and Yoko 
Ono. 
Sly Stone mumbled mo.&.t of his 
answeI'S" ~di1ririg their chat,kept 
saying "I like you," to Cavett and 
got bored. 
Grace Slick tried to remain 
above it all by calling Cavett "Jim." 
(He responds mock angrily, 
"You've got to learn my name, 
Miss Joplin!" Everyone laughs: 
Cavett never pretended to be hip, 
but he wasn't a pushover either.) 
But one disc in this first set is de­
voted to perhaps Cavett's most im­
portant and memorable musical 
guest of all: Janis Joplin, who loved 
doing the show. And no wonder: 
Cavett brought out the sweet, 
funny and delightful person she 
truly was. 
Whether she's extolling the vir­
tues of F. Scott Fitzgerald or eng­
aging in a surreal battle of wits 
with Raquel Welch, Joplin shined 
with Cavett. 
On one show, Cavett jokes that 
he's up on all the latest lingo. 
"Yeah," says Joplin. "I can tell 
you're a real swinger by the shoes 
you're wearing." 
Cavett barely drank but Joplin 
once got him stoned on a joint big 
enough to impress Cheech & 
Chong. Cavett returned the favor 
by taking Joplin out to a fancy New 
York restaurant. 
Cavett rni.sses Joplin still. 
Watching ' episode after episode 
of Cavett -filled with fascinating 
guests, witty and informed conver­
sation and terrific music -you re­
alize we miss Cavett, too. VI
