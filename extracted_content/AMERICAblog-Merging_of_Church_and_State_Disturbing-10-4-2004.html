10/04/2004 09:32:00 PMThink the conflation of church and state in the US is disturbing? (Weare, after all, one of the most actively religious countries in the world-- ie, lots of us go to worship all the time.)Well, we've got nothing on Spain where a new Socialist primeminister is tussling with the Catholic Church over restraining itsinfluence in public life."Summarizing the country's mood," wrote the NYT, "José LuisRodríguez Zapatero, the new Socialist prime minister, said the otherday that Spaniards wanted more freedom, less dogma and a greaterseparation of church and state. "They want more sports, lessreligion,'' he said."This has meant equal rights for gays in marriage and adoption,making religious education in public schools optional (!) and so on.Rome is furious. The most curious passage:"But marriage rights for gay couples is far from the only issuetroubling the Catholic Church," says NYT. "Further government plansinclude liberalizing abortion laws, allowing embryo research fortherapeutic purposes, making divorce easier and cracking down ondomestic violence."The Catholic Church is disturbed by a crackdown on domesticviolence? There's got to be some explanation -- however far-fetched-- for this statement. Anyone know what exactly this refers to?
