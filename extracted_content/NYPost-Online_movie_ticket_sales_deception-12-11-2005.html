Spoiling the plot for deceptive online movie listings 
By MICHAEl GlI,;TZ 
SAVVY New Yorkers 
know that if they want 
to see a blockbuster 
like "King Kong" on 
opening night, they've got to 
buy their tickets days -or 
even weeks -in advance. 
But the two main ticker sell­
ers -Moviefone and Fan­
dango -aren't interested In 
helping you fmd the most 
convenient movie theater at 
the best time. 
Their job is [0 sell you 
tickets to their movie chains 
and steer YOll away from 
their competitors. 
With big films like "Kong" 
and "Munich" on the hori­
zon, here's how you can 
avoid the traps they lay for 
you. We'll use the recent 
debut of ''Harry Potier and 
the Goblet of Fire" as an 
example. 
~ Moviefone& Fandango 
Each company has exclu­
sive deals with certain movie chains. Often, until opening 
day, their sites feature 
incomplete listing ornitting 
competitors' theaters. 
Selling tickets [0 favored 
chains -with a nice sur­
cha.rge -is where the com­
panies make most of their 
money. So when buying tick­
ets before a movie has 
opened, make sure you 
check both Web sites regu­
larly to see what theaters 
your movie is playing before 
youcommlt. 
can't find a good showtime? 
Just be patient. 
Just 48 hour before 
"Potter" opened on Nov. 
18, Loews 34th Srreet listed 
only one "batch" of show­
times -with only one 
prime showing at 8 p.rn. 
Obviously, a movie like 
"Potler" will premiere on a 
gazillion screens, and a 
multiplex like Loews 34th 
will be showing it at multi­
ple times. So if it looks like 
they're showing the times for only one screen and it's 
already sold out, be 
patient. 
Don't buy tiClkets to [hat 
5 p.m. or II p.m. showing if 
you can hold off and keep 
checking online and by 
phone: More times will be 
added. 
But you have to be vigilant 
and check regularly -
there's no t !ling when more 
showings will pop up. And if 
you're trying to buy tickets to 
a movie like "Brokeback 
Mountain" or "Syriana," 
check Web sites like upcom­
ingmovies.com. They might 
be opening only on a handful 
of screens before going into 
wider release. 
Don't hang up if they start 
listing theaters in Jersey. 
Many times, people use 
these phone services just 
to learn theaters and show­
limes near y. So when the 
automated voke begins 
with chains a few blocks 
away and then starts listing locations In Brooklyn and 
even New Jersey, people 
hang up thlnking they've 
heard all the 10cations 
nearby. 
Nope. These services 
often list aU of the chains 
they have deals with fIrst. 
You may have to skip 
through 10 or more listings 
before they mention a 
competitor's theater only a 
block or two away. 
The day "Potter" opened, 
Movlefone listed City Cin­
ema's East 86th Street loca­
tion sixth on its list. Fan­
dango listed it 17th -after 
iocations in Queens, 
Brooklyn and New Jersey. 
Fandango listed the United 
Artis s Union Square Loca­
tion fifth; Moviefone llsted 
it 14th. 
When onrme. read a06stings. 
They pull the same stunt 
online, where movie the­
ater locations are usually 
shown in batches of fIve. 
You may have to scroll through five or six "-pages" 
before finding the theater 
you want buried at the end. 
If you were in Harlem 
and wanted to see "Potter" 
on opening day, Moviefone 
listed tbe Coliseum The­
ater on 181st Street fourth 
when you entered the 
10033 rip code. Fandango 
listed the Coliseum 13th. 
Remember, nei.rber serv­
i.e is "better" than the orb­
er. They both list th 
chains they have deals with 
first. HARRIED FOR 
HARRY? You 
can land tix to 
hot flicks. 
So uyou want to get into 
a blockbuster on openlug 
night, your best bet is to 
check online and by pbone 
early and often. Go by your 
local theater a week or two 
in advance; they might be 
selling tickets in person 
and you can avoid the $1.50 
service cbarge. 
And once a movie's 
opened, the sur st way to 
find out all the places a film 
is playing is to buy the New 
York Post and check out the 
ads and movie listings.</p>
