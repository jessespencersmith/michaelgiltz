8/15/2004 03:35:00 PMPakistan arrested two people involved in a plot to assassinate topCabinet members. They only released sketchy details. On Friday, theyarrested five more members of Al Qaeda.At the time, AP reported:"Pakistani officials would not name the five al-Qaeda men they saidwere arrested in the past two days, their nationalities or their roleswithin the organization."Didn't they get the memo from the Bushies who said that it was nobig deal when they leaked the arrest of that al-Qaeda computer molebecause everyone around them would learn about it anyway? Comeon, Pakistan, get on the ball! That's no way to fight terror.
