            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  J U LY  1 2 ,  2 0 0 6Baseball Screws Over Its Fans...AgainMajor League Baseball announced a new TV package today. Amid allthe details -- Fox buying a major chunk, TBS buying much of the rest --one tiny detail caught my eye. The World Series -- which has begun ona Saturday for many years now -- is being moved. Game One will nowbegin on a Tuesday. What does this mean?1. Little kids are screwed over and ignored again - the World Seriesstarts so late in the day (often 8:20 p.m.) and filled with so manycommercials and baseball takes so long anyway that a lot of ADULTSare exhausted with games that stretch to midnight or one in themorning as a matter of course. Many people have spoken about the factthat little kids -- the fans of the future -- can barely watch any of it,much less an entire game. People had suggested at least one or twogames -- perhaps the opener on a Saturday -- actually be a DAY game.To, you know, reach out to young fans and make it possible for them toactually WATCH the World Series. Not a chance. At least a Saturdaynight game was on the weekend when kids didn't have to go to schoolthe next morning -- meaning it was more likely kids on the bubble --like 10 or 12 year olds -- might be allowed to stay up. Now, with GameOne beginning on a Tuesday, a school night, no way.2. A Tuesday start instead of a Saturday start -- I'm guessing thatmeans the World Series begins three days later rather than four daysearly. They need to explain how this affects the calendar. With baseballpadding the regular season and adding extra rounds to the post season,the World Series starts later and later all the time. One game of theOctober Classic was even played in November. So baseball can nowbegin in the snows of April and end in November, stretching out analready interminable season.Once again, Bud Selig and MLB could care less about the fans. They'reletting TV dictate all the rules and to hell with the kids or thinkingabout baseball's future. Soon, an entire generation will grow up withoutever even considering watching the World Series on TV. Can that be inthe best interests of the game?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 10:54 AM
