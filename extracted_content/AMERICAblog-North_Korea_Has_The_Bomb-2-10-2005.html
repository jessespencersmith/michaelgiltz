2/10/2005 01:56:00 PMYes, on Bush's watch North Korea claims it has the bomb anddoesn't care who knows it. And those US-sponsored talks?Nothing doing. Of course, the US could always threaten tounilaterally invade. Oh wait, our military is so stretched thinthat it CAN'T attack North Korea. Bush's response to Korea'sclaim: no biggie, we figured as much.As blogger Michael Hawthorne points out, Iran isn't particularlyintimidated by our overworked military, threatening a "burninghell" for any aggressors.Link this with Bush cozying up to Pakistan -- which sold nuclearmaterial and know-how to any and all comers and has beenrewarded with our largesse -- not to mention Bush's utterfailure to spend the mere hundreds of millions it would take tolock down the nuclear weapons loose in Russia and the formerSoviet countries. Thanks for keeping the world safe (for thespread of nuclear weapons), Mr. President.
