Regarding Henry 
I rish novelist Colm T 6ibin talks about writing The Master, his 
riveting journey into the mind of America's great gay writer 
Henry James By Michael Giltz 
Perhaps it was fate. 
Acclaimed Irish au­
thor Colm T6ibin 
was slyly dubbed 
"the Henry James of Enniscor­
thy" back in 1999 by The [London 1 In­
dependent. Now he has boldly tackled 
the life of that legendary 19th-century 
novelist in The Master (Scribner, $25). concealed his own attraction 
to men. 
For T6ibin, who fIrst wrote 
about James in a piece collect­
ed in his book of essays and ar­
ticles Love in a Dark Time 
(Simon & Schuster, $24), The 
Master was a chance to reclaim 
the life of a writer who removed 
almost all traces of his sexuality 
from his fiction. 
"I couldn't see how you 
could do it as a novelist," ad­
mits T6ibin. "It just seemed an 
astonishing level of artistry, 
the levels of self-effacement 
involved. He does give it 
away in places-he's so in­
terested in secrecy. And if 
secrets are told, they will be 
so destructive and so explo­
sive. In my own case, I ex­
ploded, I suppose." 
T6ibfn is already recog­
nized as an author of the first 
rank in Europe. His third 
novel, The Story of the Night, 
was picked by the Publishing Triangle as 
one of the 100 Best Lesbian and Gay 
Novels of all time. And his most recent, 
The Blackwater Lightship, was short­
listed for the Booker Prize and turned

<p>It was three novels into his career 
that T6ibfn tackled gay issues himself. 
Indeed, an editor and friend urged 
T6ibfn to deal with gay life after writing 
two novels-The South and The 
Heather Blazing. They'd made his name 
and admirably tackled Ireland's history 
but seemed to avoid the heart of who he 
was. "Coming out" in his fiction felt to 
T6ibfn like coming out of a box. 
"I must say, it was greeted with im­
mense relief by everyone I knew, be­
cause people were so glad: 'He's finally 
fucking written about it,'" laughs T6ibfn, 
who lives in Dublin and spends his sum­
mers in the Pyrenees. Still, he says, "I'm 
probably going to write my next two 
books where it won't be a subject." 
Being gay is the unspoken subtext of 
James's entire life. T6ibin shows him 
subtly attracted to a manservant, listen­
ing to gossip about Oscar Wilde's trial, 
spending a tension-filled night lying 
naked in bed next to future Supreme 
Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., 
and yearning quietly for a gorgeous 
young sculptor. 
"I'm obviously interested in the gay 
past and what can be done with it," says 
T6ibin. "There's very little that we 
know. At one point I suddenly realized 
this is a really great story. It's a very dra­
matic business being Henry James. And 
once I saw it as a story you could tell, I 
thought I could actually do this." 
Indeed, James is compelled by his 
mother to feign illness to avoid fighting 
in the Civil War, suffers the painful 
deaths and suicides of both family mem­
bers and mends, and deals with the in­
dignities of colossal failure on the Lon­
don stage. (T6ibfn himself, ironically, is 
writing a play for the Abbey Theatre­
something he'd never considered be­
fore.) But James's professional failure at 
drama can't compare to the personal 
failure of an empty emotional-and 
physical-life. 
"I'd love to have given him one big 
shag in the book, one major shag," says 
T6ibfn, who is single. "But it couldn't 
be done. One long night of licking and 
sucking and fucking. But not a hope of 
it, I'm afraid. It wasn't true to the spirit 
of him." •
