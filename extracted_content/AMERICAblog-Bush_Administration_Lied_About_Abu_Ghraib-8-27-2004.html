8/27/2004 02:04:00 PMThe New York Times obtained part of the classified report by threegenerals on Abu Ghraib.1. Military officials and the Bush Administration repeatedly lied --they claimed prisoners in Iraq were being treated by the rules of theGeneva Convetion when they knew this was not true.2. Abusive techniques were not the result of a bad few acting on theirown -- these abusive methods that violated the Geneva Conventionwere approved at the highest level; indeed, by Lt. General Ricardo S.Sanchez, the former top commander in Iraq. It doesn't get muchhigher up the chain of command than that. The abusive techniquesthey approved also violated those in the standard Army field manual-- so no one had any excuses in claiming they didn't know it waswrong.3. The only reason any of this was "classified" and withheld from theAmerican people? It was embarrassing."Army officials said Thursday that some sections of the report hadbeen marked secret because they referred to policy memorandumsthat were still classified," wrote the New York Times."But the report's discussion of the September and October orders,while critical of General Sanchez and his staff, do not disclose manynew details of the orders and do not appear to contain sensitivematerial about interrogations or other intelligence-gatheringmethods. They do show in much clearer detail than ever before howinterrogation practices from Afghanistan and Guant√°namo werebrought to Abu Ghraib, and how poorly the nuances of what wasacceptable in Iraq were understood by military intelligence officials inIraq."
