6/15/2005 04:36:00 PMThe US Congress is seriously close to passing a ConstitutionalAmendment that would forbid flag burning. And not a momenttoo soon!The Citizens Flag Alliance, an advocacy group that supportsa constitutional amendment, reports a decline in flagdesecration incidents, with only one this year.We're fighting a war on terror, our soldiers are dying in Iraq, ourborders are not secure, most cargo shipments go unchecked, theyhaven't compiled a list of terrorist names to crosscheck againstpeople arriving in this country and the FBI STILL doesn't have newcomputers. And Congress is wasting its time protecting a flag thatdoesn't need protecting. And how much do you wanna bet EVERYRepublican senator who couldn't be bothered to condemn lynching istaking the time to support this one? And that they'll hold the vote inthe middle of the day and try to curry as much media attention aspossible?
