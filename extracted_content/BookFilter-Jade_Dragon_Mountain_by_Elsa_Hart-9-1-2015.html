All havecome for a spectacle unprecedented in this remote province: aneclipse of the sun commanded by the Emperor himself.

Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayIt's 1708 and disgraced librarian/scholar Li Du is reluctantly checking in with the local officials while travelingthroughout the outer regions of China. He's been banished from the Forbidden City and long ago gave up the hopeor desire of returning. Unfortunately for him, the Emperor is coming to this godforsaken corner of his empire towitness (and indeed "bring about") an eclipse. It's all show to demonstrate the Emperor's potency and lay claim to thehearts and minds of a region barely under control. When a Jesuit astronomer is murdered, Li Du must reluctantlyinvestigate in order to prevent any further complications during the Emperor's visit. Naturally, Li Du faces a full arrayof suspects in this small town, including a representative of UK businessmen, local rebels unhappy with theEmperor's reign, a calculating consort of the head magistrate who may be unhappy about her man's advancementsince it would mean leaving her behind and many more. Li Du must sort through the possibilities, with the nominalaide of a storyteller/Watson or sorts and needs all his wits to stay invisible (he is after all persona non grata), avoidruffling feathers, smooth the way for the Emperor and if possible see justice done. Hart's debut in what is sure to be aseries is very strong on atmosphere and a Christie-like plot containing all the suspects in one specific settling whenthe murder takes place, complete with timelines, red herrings and the like. Li Du's sidekick hasn't come into his ownhere but might well in future adventures. It's already great fun and hopefully Hart will improve things even more thesecond time around. Buffs who enjoy mysteries set in worlds and times they can learn about will find much to savor. -- MIchael GiltzLessWhat Others SayPerfectly melds history with the mystery genre for a lush look at China on the cusp of change.
