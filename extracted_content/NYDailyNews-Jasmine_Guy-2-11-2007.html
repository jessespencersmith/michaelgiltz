HEATER.,,
brant time between World War I and the Depres-
sion when Harlem was in full bloom.
Its bold. unconventional structure. as well
as its title, is inspired in part by Jean Toomer's
1923 novel. "Cane."
"My mother is an English lit teacher and my
father [apastor] is also aprofessor," says Guy.
"I ran it by her and she said, 'Oh, "Cane" -
your father's favorite novel.'I said, 'It is?'and then, for years, he passed as white."
That sad fact is the sort of humanizing detail
that can bring these historical figures to life,
says the actress.
"It's very hard to just memorize facts," says
Guy, who, in October, brings a film festival to
the Caribbean that focuses on music-orient-
ed features. "But when we see somebody as
a mother, when we see somebody as a lover
orwe realize that secrets were kept, theybe-
come real to us. I want to picture the artists of
the Harlem Renaissance all hanging out. I love
that. These people were all friends." t"It almost changed the way we wrote, the way
Marlon Brando changed the way we acted. Jean
ir;,, Toomer has a weird history because he wrote
ft tfrir novel and then wentinto obscurity -,.,ffi.

42-year-old actress who danced withAlvin
Ailey and then shot to fame on the "Cosby
Show" spinoff sitcom "A Different World"
in the late'80s and early'90s.
"It seems like we go from slavery to the
l'Rbisin' Cane," which tours through mid-
Ilarch, captures the spirit of the Harlem Re-
npiss4nce by drawing on the words and po-
eqrs and songs and speeches ofpeople like
Cpuntee Cullen and Zora Neale Hurston, Fa-
ther Divine and Claude McKav. Combined
w,rth photos and paintings of and by the
aliti6tp, with a jazz score byAvery Sharpe
