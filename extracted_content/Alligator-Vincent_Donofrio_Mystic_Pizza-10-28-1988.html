In Mystic Pizza, a new romantic comedy currently 
playing at the Oaks Four West Theater, much is 
made of "Mystic Pizza," a popular local delicacy 
with mysterious ingredients in the sauce. 
Equally mysterious is Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio, 
the actor who plays Bill. He has appeared in three 
features in roles that are wildly disparate, both in 
temperament and physical looks. 
In Full Metal Jacket, D'Onofrio had the plum part 
of Private Leonard "Gomer" Pyle, the lumbering, 
overweight recruit who is turned into a killing 
machine all too quickly. In Adventures in Babysitting, 
he did a small turn as a mechanic who resembles 
Thor, the god of thunder in Norse mythology. The 
two films were released around the same time and 
Vincent Phillip D' Onofrio fells UII Taylor why 
he reads 'Applause' cover-fo-cover. the change in his appearance 
garnered D'Onofrio a lengthy 
Times. 
With the character of Bill, lie faces his most 
probable role yet: a young, A rican male who feels 
uncomfortable about having s with his girlfriend, 
Jojo, because she won't commi to their relationship. 
D'Onofrio told in a teleph ne interview about 
preparing for his role as a fishellman in Mystic, Conn. 
"Before we started shooting,' he said, "I was hang­
ing out with a lot of the fish'!! en, trying to get to 
know what they were reall like: the way they 
treated their wives, the way ey looked at their 
girlfriends. 
'1 was very fortunate to hav Lili (Taylor) play my 
girlfriend. We just wanted it tf be realistic because 
we knew that the comedic lines would work for 
themselves ." 
Th1'!ir relationship is just one of many stories in 
Mystic Pizza, an amiable, understated comedy that</p>
<p>Mysterious sauces and mysterious men 
spice up the cinema wittitheir flavor 
centers on three young women who work together 
in a pizza parlor. One of them, Katherine (Annabeth 
Gish), is a somewhat frumpy, young woman strug­
gling to find the money to afford the tuition at Yale. 
Jokingly called St. Katherine because she always 
does the right thing, Kat finds herself falling in love 
with the good looking, older man whose daughter 
she is babysitting while his wife is in Europe. 
Her sister Daisy Qulia Roberts), is a vibrantly at­
tractive, free-willed person who has little going for 
her other than the force of her personality . She be­
comes emotionally entangled -against her better 
judgement -with Charlie, a rich preppie. 
The third woman is Jojo (Lili Taylor) who begins 
the movie by panicking on her wedding day and 
fainting at the altar. She spends the rest of the movie 
wavering between her love for Bill and her fear of 
making the wrong decision. 
D'Onofrio enjoyed the challenge of his even­
tempered, somewhat moralistic character. 
"Bill was different, sort of a role reversal for a guy 
to play. It was also a vehicle for me to show people 
that I wasn't a psychopath." 
That, of course, is a reference to his most visible 
performance, the critically acclaimed portrayal of an 
over-th~ge recruit in Full Metal Jacket. Though the 
part has given his career a major boost, it was also 
extremely demanding. '1 was with Stanley Kubrick for 13 months," he 
notes, sounding tired at the mere mention of it. "Just 
carrying that weight around and the intensity of the 
role -the extremes that the character goes through 
-weighed very heavily on me. It was something 
that I'm glad I did ... something I'd never do again." 
Something he would consider doing again is return­
ing to the role of Bill in a sequel to Mystic Pizza -
if the script was right. 
Such an event is a distinct possibility, since the 
movie is turning into a quiet success story at ~he box 
office. Because it is a small film with an unknown 
cast, distributor Samuel Goldwyn decided to give it 
an unusual limited release. 
Rather than pushing for a big opening weekend -
an unlikely possibility at best -they have opened 
the movie on a relatively small 386 screens and sup­
ported it with a strong ad campaign. 
Thus, Mystic Pizza has become one of those rare 
features given the opportunity to find its audience, 
and the gamble has paid off. The reviews have bef>n 
favorable and attendance has been growing every 
week, indicating a positive audience response and 
good word-of-mouth . If all goes as planned, film­
ing will begin next year on a sequel that picks up 
the storyline five years down the road. 
"It's always nice to say 'Let's do a sequel,'" said 
D'Onofrio. "But it depends on who directs it and it depends on what it's about. My first thought is that 
it is a very good idea." 
And what does D'Onofrio see five years down the 
road for Bill and Jojo? 
'1 see a lot of children," he jokes. "I see havoc." 
Mystic Pizza 
was a vehicle 
for D' Onofrio 
to prove he 
wasn't a 
psychopath. , '</p>
