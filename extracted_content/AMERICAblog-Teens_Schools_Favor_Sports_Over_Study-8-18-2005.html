8/18/2005 01:54:00 AMI'm not big on polls, but this one shows teens are pretty savvywhile educators want to deny reality.USA Today reports that 45% of teens surveyed feel unsafein schools, especially in larger towns and cities. The head ofthe National Association of Secondary School Principals insistskids are wrong and "schools are increasingly safe."That's right, the kids are paranoid for no good reason; maybewe should up their dosage to keep 'em docile.And when 41% of teens say their school emphasizesathletics as opposed to 27% which say academics is the toppriority, the same bozo admits that "in certain parts of thecountry, athletics rule supreme" but insists the kids arewrong again and most schools are focused onacademics.It sounds like public schools need to start listening to theirstudents instead of their own pr. And here's the proof highschools are failing kids: a new report saysHundreds of thousands of this year's college-bound highschool graduates aren't prepared enough academically tosucceed in college.
