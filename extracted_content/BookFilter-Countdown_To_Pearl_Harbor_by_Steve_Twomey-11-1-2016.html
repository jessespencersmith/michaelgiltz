From the Publisher: A fascinating look at the twelve days leading up to
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor—the warnings, clues and missteps—bya Pulitzer Prize–winning reporter.
In Washington, DC, in late November 1941, admirals compose the most
ominous message in Navy history to warn Hawaii of possible danger, butthey write it too vaguely. They think precautions are being taken, butnever check to see if they are. A key intelligence officer wants more
warnings sent, but he is on the losing end of a bureaucratic battle and
can’t get the message out. American sleuths have pierced Japan’s mostvital diplomatic code, and Washington believes it has a window on theenemy’s soul—but it does not.
In a small office at Pearl Harbor, overlooking the battleships at the heart
of America’s seafaring power, the Commander of the Pacific Fleet tries tofigure out how much danger he…

What We Say
A solid, straight-forward account of the twelve days leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. That may be more
of an accomplishment than I appreciate, since Pearl Harbor is an event ripe for conspiracy theory and exaggeration. Ihaven't read widely on it and this popular history seems quite reasonable. Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Twomey combs
through the available record and brings to life the many disparate personalities, hidebound traditions, racism and simple
human error that led to the US being caught flat-footed on December 7, 1941. Twomey makes a hash of the suggestion thatShare This Book

<p>FDR knew about the upcoming attack and let it happen. How? Common sense, dogged connecting of the dots, the public
record, private thoughts and mostly by showing how it did happen and why FDR clearly didn't want to fight a war on two
fronts since he didn't have the Navy to do so even BEFORE it was decimated by the Japanese. Finally, the attack wasstupendously risky and bold and even the very few in the US who considered the remote possibility didn't really take itseriously. But don't let that sideshow of paranoia distract you. Twomey mostly spends his time illuminating the many people
caught up in the moment with empathy and insight. He doesn't look for villains but neither does he look away when
someone behaves foolishly. It makes this tragic history feel far from inevitable but perfectly understandable, a convergenceof little errors and happenstance culminating in tragedy. -- Michael Giltz
