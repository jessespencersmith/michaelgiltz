"THE LION KING 11f2" 
This straight-to-DV D piffle explains why Pixar and 
Disney, iIT the end, were not a good match. The cre­
ators behind some of the most successful recent ani­
mated films ("Toy Story," "Finding Nemo"), Pixar has 
made only one sequel to their blockbusters, while 
Disney churns out dreck, like this spinoff from "The 
Lion King" that shows what Timon and the flatulent 
Pumbaa were up to before the original began ($29.99, 
Disney). Sure. it makes Disney a pretty penny, but it 
also cheapens the aura of their classics and trains its 
animators in how to settle for second-best -which is 
exactly what Pixar and Uncle Walt would never do. 
"IN TKE CUT" 
"SYLVIA" 
How many times can people be surprised by Meg 
Ryan playing against type? She's done it every third 
or fourth movie -from the brilliant. overlooked 
"Flesh and Bone" in 1993. to the less successful 
"\Vhen a Man Loves a Woman" in '94, then "Courage 
Under Fire" in '96. "Hudyburly" in '98, and now with 
rhe dour crime drama "In the Cut" ($26.96, Columbia 
TriStar) for director Jane Campion. The movie 
never cuts deep, but the mess::;d¥up Ryan an.d a com­
pellingly base Mark Ruffalo as a cop do their best. 
Gwyneth Paltrow also strives to make sense out of 
the unhappy life of poet Sylvia Plath, but to little ef· 
feet in "Sylvia" ($26.98. Universal) . Read her work­
and the work of her oft-demonized husband Ted 
Hughes -instead. 
''lENA, WARRIOR PRINCESS": SEASON THREE 
"ANGEL": SEASON TiiREE 
For a while. "Xena." the Sapphic spinoff to "Her­
cules," was even more popular thanks to the stalwart 
Lucy Lawless and a general air of silliness. Season 
Three ($69.98. Anchor Bay) has one of their best cliff­
hangers, "Sacrifice I and II," and loads of extras. 
"Angel" never came close to outshining "Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer," but its third season ($59.98, Fox) fi­
nally established the show's own identiry. 
It's time to revel in overlooked genre flicks from 
overseas, like the Japanese Nikkatsu action movies of 
Seijnn Suzuki, who turned out 1965's "Tattooed Life." 
about two brothers on the lam after one of ,hem kills a 
yakuza. Also out is "Underworld Beauty" (1958). and 
1963's "Kanto Wanderer " ($19.95 each. HVE). 
Also out: 
George Clooney shows comic aplomb in the Coen 
brothers' intriguing "Intolerable Cruelty" ($26.98, 
Universal); Gerard Depardieu's grand performance in 
the romantic heartbreal,er, "Cyrano De Bergerac" 
($19.98, MGM), from 1990; Val Kilmer plays porn star 
John Holmes in "Wonderland" ($26.99, Lions Gate), 
with extras including actual crime scene footage; 
"Higher Ground: Voices of Contemporary Gospel 
Music" ($19.99, Image) details how gospel legends 
iike Mahalia Jackson and Kirk Franklin were consid­
ered rebels for setting religious music [0 secular 
rhythms, while sporlighting the current rrend-setters 
like Mary Mary and Out of Eden; Paul Bettany pla)'s a 
man who cheats on his wife (Olivia Williams) with 
her sister (Helena Bonham Carter) in "The Heart of 
Me" ($26.99; Sundance). 
Out next week: 
Michelangelo Antonioni's mod classic "Blow-Up," 
starring Vanessa Redgrav e; "Stone Reader," the 
dOCUlnentary about a man's obsession wilh an ob­
scure novel; and Sid and Marty Kroft's trippy kiddie 
show "H.R. Pufustuf."</p>
