            <p>The unwdcomewagon
hen you move into a new
neighborhood, you can check out
the schools, the grocery store and
property taxes. But you can't really
know what your neighbors will be like until you
settle in.
You're even rnore helpless when folks move
in next door - all you can do is grin and bear
it when they come over to chat or borrow a
cup of sugar and decide to stay for dinner.
Not Samuel L. Jackson. In "Lakeview Terrace,"
opening Friday, he's a racist LAPD cop who will
do anything to drive away the interracial couple
that has moved in next door.
Here are six more examples of annoying,
tiresome and downright frightening neighbors.
REAR WTNDOW Cr954)
iln neighbors: The ultimate spy-onJour-
neighbor movie, with Jimmy Stewart having
a lield day peeking in on the lives of a Miss
Lonelyhearts, a bickering couple, a young
swinger and ... what was that? MurdeP
Stay or scl? Definitely stay. A chopped-up
body is no biggie compared to the fabulous,
entertaining view.
NEIGHBORSO9SI)
Tfte neigftboc: In a wonderful example of
playing against type, John Belushi is a timid,
quiet man whose new neighbor - an over-the-top Dan Aykroyd - drives him bonkers with
attention.
Stay or sem Stay. Aykroyd's wife (Cathy
Moriarty) is very, very friendly, and that makes
up for a lot of annoyance.
ROSEMARYS BABY(1968)
The neighbors: Surely Mia Fanow and John
Cassavetes can put up with the eccentric and
pushy Ruth Gordon. After all, they've moved
into the Dakota (renamed the Bramford!
Stay or sC? Gordon's a Satanist and has
impregnated Farrow with the spawn of Lucifer?Sigh. Sell, we guess, but ifs a close call - who
gives up an apartment in the Dakota?
THE'BURBS0989)
Ifte neighboe How can you trust new
neighbors named the Klopeks? Really, what kind
of name is that, anyway? Tom Hanks is goofing
around at home on vacation and decides the
mysterious Klopeks need investigating.
Stay or sell? Stay, but your neighbors might
move. We have met the nosy, prying, annoying
neighbor, and sometimes... it is us. When you're
running down the people who live nearby, keep
in mind you might not be such a treat, either.
ARLTNGTON ROAD0999)
Ilrc nefuhbors: Jeff Bridges has been a
bit... edgy since his wife, an FBI agent, died
in a Waco-style tragedy. His new neighbor
(Tim Robbins) seems like a nice wakeup call
until Bridges decides that Robbins is a white-supremacist terrorist himself.
Stry or se[? Sell, and move into a mental
institution. Really, what is it about neighbors
that can drive us bonkers? Some people need to
live in a cabin - like Ted Kaczynski!
DUPLEX(2OO3)
Tte neighbors: Ben Stiller and Drew
Barrymore have discovered the perfect
Brooklyn brownstone. Too bad the elderly lady
living in a rent-controlled apartment on the top
floor is the neighborfrom Hell, who plays in a
brass band - and thafs her good quality.
Stay or selF Stay. Homicide is a small price
to pay for the perfect New York City home. Just
make sure Jimmy Stewart isn't peering out of
his window with binoculars when you do the old
biddy in. Michael GilE</p>
