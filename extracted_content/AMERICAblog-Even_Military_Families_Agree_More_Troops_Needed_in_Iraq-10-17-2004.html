10/17/2004 02:27:00 AMDuh, you say, since top military and civilian officials have all said weneeded -- and need -- more troops to win the peace in Iraq. But it'sgood to know even the staunch pro-war, pro-Bush families of themilitary recognize reality.The fascinating LA Times poll has a lot more interesting nuggets."While members of the military and their families strongly support thewar in Iraq, a strong majority say the Administration underestimatedthe number of troops needed to win, according to a national poll ofservice men and women and their families.Sixty-two percent of amilitary sample polled by the University of Pennsylvania's NationalAnnenberg Election Survey said the Bush administration had too fewtroops to Iraq. And respondents said the war has placed too much ofa burden on inadequately trained and equipped National Guard andReserve forces, who make up almost 50% of soldiers currentlyfighting in Iraq," reports the LA Times.On hiding the coffins of fallen soldiers from the American people:"The respondents also overwhelmingly disagreed with the Pentagonpolicy of barring photographs of flag-draped coffins being returned toDover Air Force Base in Delaware. Fifty-one percent of the militarysample said allowing photographs would increase respect for thesacrifices made by the military. Only 8% said it would reducerespect."On whether Bush is taking care of ill veterans:"Only 30% said they thought veterans were getting the health carethey had been promised. And while 57% said that Pentagon-orderedextensions of service beyond enlistment dates were proper, 39%, asignificant minority, said they were not."On gays in the military:"The poll's findings on attitudes toward gays in the military alsoshowed striking differences by rank. Commissioned officers and theirfamilies opposed their inclusion by 53% to 39%. Noncommissionedofficers and their families were also clearly opposed, by a 57% to35% margin. But 50% of junior enlisted personnel said gays andlesbians should be allowed to serve openly, while 43% said theyshould not."On women in the military:"Once divisive, the military sample overwhelmingly approved of thework of women in the armed forces. Seventy-four percent said theyperformed as well as the men they served with, 10% said they didworse than men, and 7% said they did better than men."
