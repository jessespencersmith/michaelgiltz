            <p>Exclusive: PR Guru Behind Fake FoxNews "Study" Speaks Up
A fake study claiming conservative viewers of FOX News were significantly dumber
than conservatives who didn't  watch FOX News spread through the internet like
wildfire, even though the briefest of attention to the details in this glorified pressrelease should have raised suspicion. The pr guru behind the hoax -- our term, nothis -- said he was surprised by how quickly and broadly the item spread but not byhow easily its claims went unquestioned. "Facts are obsolete," said P. Nichols, thecontact given for the press release who claimed Nichols was his last name butrefused to confirm his entire name, the name of the Republican PAC he says backedthe "study" or any of the people behind the actual report he insisted did truly exist.And no, he wouldn't send us a copy of it.
If you're a liberal, it sounded too good to be true: a four year "study" by the
Intelligence Institute found that viewers of Fox News who identified themselves as
conservative had an average IQ of 80, some 20 points lower than those conservatives
who got their news from other sources or did not watch the news at all. Typically, this
was reduced online to the idea that people who watch FOX News are dumb, dumber
than the national average or that watching FOX News makes you dumber.
The story -- or rather the press release posted on PRWeb  that was soon reposted on
Yahoo News and numerous liberal political blogs as a genuine article -- spread
quickly, thanks to juicy quotes like this one from P. Nichols, named as the "leadresearcher" on the study. "Several previous studies show that self-identifiedconservatives are less intelligent than self-identified moderates," said Nichols in thepress release he himself wrote. "We have never seen such a homogeneous groupteetering so close to special needs levels." Nichols also quoted himself as saying,"Fox News' content is presented at an elementary school level and plays directly intothe fears of the less educated and less intelligent."
Since then, sites like Daily Kos  have noted that the study was likely a hoax. And for
good reason.*The Intelligence Institute does not exist  -- It was a name created by Nichols and
his team to give the "study" they were releasing some credibility. They didn't even
bother to create a fake website as a front for the imaginary group. However, that may
change. Nichols said that this study/press release was so effective that now perhaps
there was some value to the name of The Intelligence Institute and they might use itfor other studies they did or perhaps even create an actual conservative non-profitgroup.
*The lead researcher P. Nichols was not the lead researcher -- When asked
various questions about the methodology of the study, Nichols -- who was reached bya Google Voice phone number that forwarded the call to his real telephone number --said that wasn't really his area of expertise. But wasn't he the "lead researcher?" Headmitted that may not be the most appropriate title for his role. So what title would hechoose? Nichols thought for a minute, tossed out "publicity" and then settled on"maybe project manager?"
*The study did not take four years  -- Why would the study as described take four
years? He couldn't answer. When asked for specifics, Nichols admitted the people
backing the study became actively interested in taking action after the 2010 mid-termelections. I pointed out that was two years ago, making it impossible for the study tohave taken four years to do. He said two years would probably be more accurate."That's one of those things that if it had been fact-checked by CNN might not make it
through," Nichols cheerfully said.
*The study may not have tested anyone's IQ in the first place  -- The only tests
described in the press release were social science experiments and nothing that
would measure someone's IQ. When asked which if any of the standard IQ tests wereadministered, Nichols demurred again on specifics, though insisting that actual IQtests were in fact performed. He would not however release any details or makeanyone who actually worked on the study as a scientist available for interview.
*The study was rigged from the start  -- Nichols himself brought up the fact that theApril 30, 2014

<p>study was designed to reach the conclusion they were looking for: that is, to show that
self-identified conservatives who watched FOX News were less smart than
conservatives who didn't. "They told me what they wanted to do and I said I could doit," he claimed. Nichols said the moderate Republicans behind the PAC supportingthis effort wanted to counter the effect of the Tea Party and encourage moderates to
come forward. Making people embarrassed to say they watched FOX News (or better
yet not watch FOX News at all) might help that goal. So the 5000 people who took
part in the study were chosen by Nichols and non-scientists, essentially selected toguarantee the results they were looking for. "We stuck to the rural South," said
Nichols, who admitted they had a hard time finding conservatives in Alabama and
other states who didn't watch FOX News but dug them up to give the study somebalance. He insisted the actual study was performed and that the results were
genuine, though of course the "scientists" involved accepted the fact that the people
being studied would be supplied to them and therefore not be random. Nichols
admitted this meant the study would never have passed any sort of peer review panelor be accepted for publication by any journal of note. Still, he repeatedly stated thatthe study was real and did exist. "I would not have published it were it completelyfraudulent," he said, pointing out that to do so might have crossed some legalboundaries and "nobody wanted to do that." Hence his claim that the study wasactually commissioned and performed, even though it would never meet the mostminimal standards for a valid scientific report. The fact that the details Nichols offeredup about the study undercut its scientific validity lend some credence to his claim thatthe study was in fact technically done.
You might think that having the study exposed as a hoax just days after a press
release touting it was released would mean Nichols was in hot water. Far from it. He
did strenuously defend PRWeb, which is a website that offers a clearinghouse for
press releases and can hardly be expected to vet every single claim made in every
single notice that passes from their users to the web. In fact, Nichols said he had to
rewrite his press release four times before PRWeb would post it. They sent the firstdraft back "and said it read like b.s.," claimed Nichols, who said they didn't use thatword. PRWeb asked for more details about the study and more specifics until fivedrafts later they were finally satisfied that it met some minimal standards, he said.
Once people started poking around into the suspiciously vague nature of the study
and the nonexistent group that produced it, Nichols said PRWeb suspended theaccount of the group that posted the press release and demanded a meeting onMonday December 10 where they expect Nichols to provide more evidence to backthe press release's claims before they will keep this press release up or agree to postany others down the road.
So is the unnamed Republican PAC of moderate conservatives unhappy about this
tempest in a teapot? Probably not. The meme -- people who watch FOX News aredumb -- is out there and spreading. No matter how often the study is refuted (and ithappened within days), the original press release that was picked up as news will stillbe out there, forwarded and joked about and commented on like those hoax emails
about Bill Gates giving away money to people who send him a message.
"It's making a social commentary," suggests Nichols about the lightning spread of this
flimsy excuse of a press release. "Facts are obsolete. And numbers aren't asobjective as they should be."
In other words, don't believe everything you see on the web, even if it's repeated by a
news site or blog you trust. Especially if it seems too good to be true.
A Brief Look At Some Of The Sites That Linked To Or Posted The HoaxDaily Kos original post on press release.Daily Kos questions validity of study three hours later but says FOX News viewers are
suckers anyway and claims other studies confirm the main point it makes.
Yahoo News posting of press release on its news site.RSN/Reader Supported News reposts the press release in whole and lists PRWeb as
the writer.
Democratic Underground reposts the study.
FreeRepublic posted a thread on the press release and then pulled it once suspicions
were raised.
Reddit posted a link to a story on the press release but the comments all questioned
its validity.
