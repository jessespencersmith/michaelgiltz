**';, 
Fox, $39.98 __ _ 
YOU can't keep ;'1 good nWl1 
down, Massive DVD sales 
hrought back "Family Guy," 
with this season's new 
E'l'isodes available here. But 
creator Seth MacFal'lanc has 
divided his time between it 
and "American Dad," 
lE'avin~ the joke quotient 
tllin and softening the 
evil-genius baby. Let 
Stev.rie be Stewic! 
Murderball 
'" *: +, 'I, 
Thinkfilm, $29.99 
YES, this is a 
documentary about 
wheelchair athletes 
cmnpcting ill paraplegic 
rugby. But forget phrases 
like "inspiring" and 
"moving ." "Murdcrhall" is 
profane, funny, raucous 
and. exciting right down to 
the Paralympic finale's 
Yankee-Canuck grudge 
match, Good extras 
incluJe commentary, an 
I1'ITV "Jackass" special 
and player updates, 
March of the 
Penguins 
-b 
Warner Bros., $28,98 
PEOPLE love penguins, and 
most people loved "March of 
the Penguins," a rather 
routine "documentary." The 
French original was a fictional 
story with actors dubbing 
dialog. Unfortunately, that's 
not available on the DVD, 
which includes the banal u.s 
version, a Looney Tunes 
cartoon and lots of shots of 
shivering emperor penguins .

THE Muppets' delightful 
1979 feature film debut boasts 
all-star cameos from Steve 
Martin, Mel Brooks, et ai., and 
the Oscar-nominated tune 
"The Rainbow Connection ." 
... But this measly edition has 
just one brief extra, Miss 
Piggy would be offended . 82

King Kong: 
Collector's Edition *.*** Warner Bros., $39.98 
THIS 1933 classic is so pri­
mal, so exciting and, ulti­
mately, 50 moving you can't 
help wondering: Why 
remake it? Still, director 
Peter Jackson's love for the 
big apC' shines through in a 
making-of doc that's far 
longer than the movie itself. 
Also available in a box set 
wIth "Son of Kong" (]933) and 
"Mighty Joe Young" (1949), 
but that's t\VO apes too many. 
Seinfeld Seasons 5 
and 6 Gift Set 
*-10" *'/., 
Sony, $119.95 
HOW did a show about noth­
ing turn into a SitCOIIl with 
convoluted plots worthy of 
Rube Goldberg? Those antics 
would weigh down the last 
few years, but episodes like 
"Th~ Puffy Shirt" and "The 
Face Painter" make this 
essential. Among the stan­
dard-setting extras: audio 
commentaries, bloopers, triv­
ia, a handwritten script, an 
actual puffy shirt and cartoon 
versions of classic scenes 
done in "Sein-imation ." 
The Polar Express **'j, 
Warner Bros" $29,95 
TOM Hanks is fun in multi­
ple roles, the movie captures 
the look and spirit of the 
beloved picture book by 
Chris Van Allsburg, and it 
enjoyed great word of mouth, 
(The DVD has loads of extras 
for kids, too.) But if the film­
makers had poured their 
energy into a half-hour 
prime-time special instead of 
inflating this quiet story into 
" IOO-minute film, they could 
have created a classic_ 
Also out: "The Best & Worst 
of :American Idol' Seasons 1-
4" (Capital; $34,98); Akira 
Kurosawa's brilliant "Ran" 
(Criterion; $39,95). 84

SIX discs, lllore than 17 hours

not a dull moment. (Sappy? 
Yes. Dull? No.) From her ear­

everything via many, many

more personal than just a

well done. 
Oklahoma! 50th 
Anniversary Edition 
*** Fox, $26.98 
RODGERS & Hammel stein's 
best 111usical has always 
seemed a bit stodgy on film. 
But this new two-disc set of 
the 1955 movie may change 
that, It includes both the 
Cinemascopc version and the 
rarely seen Todd-AO version. 
Both were shot 
simultaneously, but the Todd­
AO version is considered oy 
fans to be better acted. 
Indeed, even the title 
sequence alld opening song 
,u'e subtly diffel ent and 
better. This "Oklahoma" is 
11H11e than OK.
