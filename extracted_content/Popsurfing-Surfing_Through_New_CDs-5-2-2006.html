            <p>T U E S D AY,  M AY  0 2 ,  2 0 0 6Surfing Through New CDsCaught up with a lot of music, thanks to driving to Pennsylvania andback. Here's a look at what I've been listening to:Tom Russell -- Love & Fear *** 1/2Classic singer-songwriter rock n roll from a veteran performer I'd neverheard of. It reminds me a lot of John Hiatt's "Bring The Family" -- thatsound of a grizzled artist hitting the sweet spot and delivering a warm,career-defining album after years in the trenches. "The Sound of OneHeart Breaking," "The Pugilist at 59" and the giddy "Stealing Electricty" (the song he performed on Letterman that caught my ear) -- this ismature, adult, terrific music.The Streets -- The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living ***Albums about the miseries of being famous are generally tiresome andat first blush this is a let-down from his masterful second album. Butstill a unique, clever rapper.Ann Nesby -- In The Spirit ** 1/2She's the aunt of "American Idol" contestant Paris and the womanRandy Jackson raved about as being "one of the best singers in theknown world." Her latest solo CD is filled with classic tunes rangingfrom gospel favorites to Bill Withers' "Grandma's Hands."Unfortunately, the music and backing vocals aren't up to her standards-- they're at best serviceable. But her singing is terrific, up to theferocious final note she delivers onn the closing song "There'sSomething About That Name." Maybe she shouldn't co-produce nexttime.The Boy Least Likely To -- The Best Party Ever ** 1/2Twee music from a British band who uses all sorts of odd kiddieinstruments (toy pianos, a recorder, a cheap xylophone) that create arather beguiling air. But most of the tunes aren't up to the standards ofopener "Be Gentle With Me." Imagine Brian Wilson if he were youngand not wacky and you get the idea here. Could improve on morelistens.Bruce Springsteen -- We Shall Overcome *** 1/2Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
