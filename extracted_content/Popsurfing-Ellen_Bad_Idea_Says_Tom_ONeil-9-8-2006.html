            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  S E P T E M B E R  0 8 ,  2 0 0 6Ellen: Bad Idea, Says Tom O'NeilThe LA Times awards show guru Tom O'Neil says Ellen Degeneres is abad idea to host the Oscars. Why? She ain't Hollywood enough and sheonly got good reviews for her post-9-11 Emmys braodcast. The othertimes she's hosted awards, reviews have been lukewarm. True, but thereviews are wrong and Ellen is a charmer who -- like Johnny Carson --can deflate the pomposity of the room without anyone feelingthreatened or belittled. The main problem with the Oscars isn't thehost anyway: it's the show as a whole. Here's hoping Ellen doesn't fill aroom with comedy writers and try to create 20 minutes of fillers, skits,audience interviews and so on. The Oscars is THREE HOURS LONG --it doesn't need comedy sketches. It needs Ellen to come out, do 6-8minutes of humor and then politely HOST -- simply smooth thingsalong with the occasional aside. That's ALL. Do that and people willlove you, Ellen. (Also, get the producers to show substantial clips of thetop acting and picture nominees, cut out banter among presenters(who should just stride quickly to the podium to show what they'rewearing and then announce the nominees), have only ONE tribute (nottwo; they do drag and having two undercuts both) etc, etc. Anyone withhalf a brain could improve the Oscars dramatically, given a free hand.(Aye, there's the rub.)POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
