'Seinfeld' set poised to break record 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
'SEINFELD" seems 
ready to set new re­
cords for the best­
selling TV show on DVD 
when it hits stores later 
this month. 
"It could be the biggest 
seller of all time," says 
Scott Hettrick, the editor 
in chief of industry trade 
paper "DVD Exclusive." 
Hettrick says you should 
bet on Jerry, Elaine, 
George and Kramer when 
they hit stores on Nov. 23 
with the extras-packed 
DVD in three different 
sets. 
One volume includes 
seasons one and two; an­
other volume includes sea­
son three; and a boxed set 
includes salt and pepper 
shakers, playing cards and 
a copy of a script with 
notes by co-creator Larry 
David for $119.95. 
With two weeks still to 
go before their release, 
Amazon com already lists 
the three packages at No. 
26, No. 11 and -for the 
priciest combo set -No. 
7. 
The best-selling TV 
show on DVD is "Chap-pelle's Show: Season One 
Uncensored" at 2 million 
units. 
That passed by "The 
Simpsons" 0.9 million 
units for its season one) 
and "Family Guy" (1.6 
million units). 
For the record, those 
numbers pale next to the­
atrical titles like "Shrek 2," 
which just sold 12.1 million 
units its first weekend, 
grossing $185 million. 
But TV shows are often 
much pricier. 
"I've been starting to 
hear some questions 
lately," admits Hettrick, 
about the chances of 
"Seinfeld'; to set records. 
"The way it's packaged, 
the way it's priced. 
There's a huge demand for 
it; it will certainly be one 
of the biggest ever, if not 
the biggest. But there ha';~ ' 
been so many surprises in 
the TV genre. 'Friends' 
was on NBC and is one of 
the highest rated shows 
ever and it didn't sell as 
well as 'Chappelle.' " 
But "Seinfeld" has been 
off NBC for six years, so 
fans haven't been deluged 
with the show the way 
"Friends" was omnipresent when it first hit DVD. 
On the other hand, it's 
still a major presence in 
reruns, reminding casual 
viewers how funny the 
show is. 
And the big batch of ex­
tras make the DVD sets 
seem more than just a re­
packaging of what people 
can see for free on TV. 
So maybe it won't reach 
blockbuster numbers akin 
to hit movies -not that 
there's anything wrong 
with that. 
At $1l9.95 each, if the 
boxed set can sell just 1.5 
million units, it alone will 
equal "Shrek 2's" first 
weekend sales in dollars 
-and that's what really 
matters in Hollywood. 
Dave Chappelle's show 
has been a game-changer 
for Comedy Central, 
which re-upped him for 
two more seasons with a 
contract that could be 
worth up to $50 million 
and includes a hefty piece 
of the DVD action. 
"Family Guy" is coming 
back from the dead with 
all new episodes at least in 
part because Fox wants to 
have more DVD sets to 
sell.</p>
