8/12/2005 04:08:00 PMNo, no, they insist. It's not because these photos (and video?)are even worse than the last ones or that it reminds everyoneagain of how awful and debasing and unAmerican our actionswere. It's not because it will remind everyone of how no one inthe upper ranks was held responsible for the widespread anddespicable mistreatment of prisoners that lowered our image inthe world to little better than a tinpot dictator. It's not becausethe Pentagon is ashamed of the photos.It's because the Pentagon is worried things might get violent inIraq and Afghanistan if the photos are released. What the helldo they think is happening right now?No one higher-up has been held responsible in the military.Bush made clear he approved heartily: why else shower honorson almost everyone in charge when it happened and why elsepunish no one of any significance?The sooner these images are released, the sooner we can starttruly condemning those humiliating practices, start holding topmilitary officials responsible and start upholding the highestideals of America instead of the lowest methods of dictatorslike Hussein
