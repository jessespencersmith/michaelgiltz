            <p>NEW THIS MONTH 
II'I'!!!''!!!'!''!'~'!!'! Simple Men. Despite 
what you may have heard, 
Hal Hartley is not an 
acquired taste--sly 
~~~!!!J intelligence and an offÂ­
kiher perspective shouldn't consign 
anyone this funny to the fringes. BeSides, 
with his penchant for witty dialogue and 
exceptionally attractive leads, it's only a 
matter of time before more people 
discover him. In Hartley's latest and best 
feafure, two brothers (Robert Burfte 
and William Sage) go in search of their 
father, "the radical shortstop," a 
baseball star who, 23 years before, had 
tumed revolutionary and gone 
underground . Burfte and Sage meander 
into the lives of two intriguing women and 
some memorable minor characters, 
such as a gas station attendant who plays 
a mean version of "Greensleeves" 
and a bitter sheriff who barely questions 
suspects before launching into a 
discourse on the vagaries of love. h's all 
linked together by a terrific screenplay, 
a very loud score, and the excitement of 
watching a singular talent continue to 
improve. New line Home Video, $92.86; 
laserdisc, $39.99. MICHAELGILlZ
