French Institute: Alliance Francaise
Fashion at FIAFCarte Blanche to Agnes B: Cinema and Fashion
Since the French created cinema and perfected fashion,
who better to discuss how the two arts inform one
another? The French Institute  in New York City boasts a
series of events through March doing just this. An
exhibition of artwork by Jean-Philippe Delhomme is on
display in their gallery at 22 East 60th Street through
April. They've partnered with FIT to screen four fashion-related documentaries including The Day
Before: Fendi by Karl Lagerfeld  on February 23 as well as A nd ELLE Created Woman  on February 27.
Three figures in fashion give talks in March: Reed Krakoff (March 21), Stefano Pilati (March 27) and
Dries Van Noten (March 29).
But the cinematic highlight is a selection of movies curated by the designer Agnes B, all of which deeply
influenced her work. It began with Jean Renoir's amusing bauble The Crime Of Monsieur Lange  last
week (which she presumably loved for the jaunty hats the women wore) and continues with ...And GodCreated Woman  on Valentine's Day (a movie better known for what Brigitte Bardot DIDN'T wear),
Godard's My Life To Live (Vivre Sa Vie)  and Pierrot Le Fou  on February 21 and Golden Marie/Casque
d'Or  on February 28. Head to the FIAF website  for more information and check out trailers for two of the
selections below.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2
